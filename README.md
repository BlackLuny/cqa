The English and Chinese labeled sets are expansions of those used in our previous work "Question Retrieval with High Quality Answers in Community Question Answering"(CIKM2014). 
We further label 262 new English queries and 535 new Chinese queries and combine the newly labeled data with those in "Question Retrieval with High Quality Answers in Community Question Answering" and publish it on "Learning Distributed Representations of Data in Community Question Answering for Question Retrieval" (WSDM2016).
