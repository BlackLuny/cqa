CL9zXIA7aa	Change your lifestyle. Reduce your spending. Live within your means. Try to earn more income (better job, more hours, second job, etc.). Use the savings that will result from the above and pay down your debt. And don't accumulate debt again.|`|LOrFtSCHaa	Well, Yes I am another dave ramsey fan, I read his book and followed his debt reduction method and I can say that in this bad economy even when gas went up none of those things have affected my personal finances.  I was able to save pay off my debt and I am in the path of wealth, still saving.  Good Luck!!|`|AA10491661	follow the baby steps. it works. but it's not fast or easy|`|4f3GfrN6aa	Personally, I think Dave Ramsay is an idiot.  His plan only works for people with very low impulse control who need to feel like they've achieved something when really they haven't.  There is a faster, cheaper way to get debt free, based on maths and commonsense.<br>  <br>  Dave Ramsay says pay down the smallest debt first.  However, in a lot of instances, that doesn't work to your benefit. It makes you feel good, because you've got rid of a debt.  However, it's likely that the debt you cleared first wasn't doing you as much harm as some other, nastier debts, which are costing you far more in interest.  <br>  <br>  Instead, pay down the HIGHEST INTEREST RATE debt first, regardless of the amount.  <br>  <br>  It works like this.<br>  <br>  Lets say you owe $5000 on a credit card at 19%.  You also have a $2000 personal loan at 7%.  If you pay off the personal loan first, you're still paying massive interest on the other debt.<br>  <br>  $2000 at 7% is $140 a year that the debt is costing you.<br>  $5000 at 19% is costing you $950 a year.<br>  <br>  By following Dave Ramsay's advice in this instance, you are costing yourself nearly $1000 a year.  Can you see why it's important to look at the rates, not the amounts? That's your secret weapon to getting debt free.<br>  <br>  The rate tells you how much interest you'll pay per year per hundred dollars you owe.  If you have a small debt and it is costing you a high rate of interest, by all means, kill off that debt first.  You want to get out of debt (and regain your sense of control, because debt is very overwhelming) so focus on the interest rate, not the amount.  <br>  <br>  My advice to you is get a piece of paper and write down all the debts.  Then rank them according to their interest rate, and ignore the amounts.  <br>  <br>  Pay minimum repayments on all the debts.  On the one with the highest interest rate, pay as much extra as you can afford.  You have a limited amount of money you can put to the debts each payday, so you need to put it on the debt where it will benefit you the most.  Once your higher interest rate debts are gone, the others will be a cinch.  As an added benefit, you'll have extra money (which you were previously paying on the higher rate debts) to tip into the lower rate debts.  <br>  <br>  Don't focus on the whole "I have multiple debts" issue.  Look at all the debts as a whole.  Every month, get a calculator out and add up how much you owe from all the debts.  That way, you'll see a difference in your situation.<br>  <br>  You can get out of debt pretty easily if you stick to this rule.  It's been in nearly every finance book I've ever read, and for good reason.  It is mathematically proven to get you out of debt faster, and save you the most in interest.  The "Dave Ramsay" plan is only in books by Dave Ramsay.  <br>  <br>  Best wishes, and good luck with the debt.|`|Yaof4DNqaa	Look up a non-proft Credit Counselling place in your area.  They can come up with a plan for you, help you budget, and help negotiate lower payments or interest rates.<br>  <br>  And they do this for a small fee or for free.

b8369a446b85899b8e20fae1630c9f7eaa	You're looking for the wrong thing.<br>  <br>  You should be looking for the most effective ways to promote your website. And, chances are that's not the easiest way. <br>  <br>  Think about this, for a moment. If you do the easiest ways and everyone else does the easiest ways, what do you think's going to happen? Yep, you're going to be doing the same thing as everyone else and you're going to get the same poor results.<br>  <br>  Be effective, and do things differently! That's what you should be trying to find out: how can I promote my website successfully!<br>  <br>  And the answer to that question is this:<br>  <br>  1) Create compelling content, and keep on doing so<br>  2) Build inbound links to this compelling content, and keep on doing so.<br>  <br>  Example?<br>  <br>  YouTube<br>  <br>  Do you think the people at YouTube write articles, swap links or any of the other blah-blah people have written as answers? They don't. You can do what's suggested just as long as you do it differently to everybody else.<br>  <br>  Think differently, and get different (better) results.<br>  <br>  PS One way of getting just a little website traffic to your site is by answering Yahoo! Answers questions for your related niche, like I've just done... ;-)|`|YAvcW83Paa	1. Write and submit articles . It is a classic, but it works. This will create traffic and promote your website for years to come. Write quality unique articles, not articles that are regenerated or provide no insight to readers, which is a huge problem these days.<br>  2. Submit ads to a high pagerank and high traffic Classified ad site such as USFreeads.<br>  3. Make sure to view related products on Amazon.com. You can try and take some customers from your competitors here by providing your own url if the product is similar.<br>  4. Review websites in your niche on Alexa to try to take some of their traffic by including a reference back to your site.<br>  5. Review some related products on epinion.<br>  6. If you purchase a product that you actually like, then feel free to give an individual respect when respect is due and leave a testimonial. 7. Whenever you send an email to someone, include your website url as a signature.<br>  8. Keep updating content on your websites/blogsâ¦ try at least once per week, if not twice.<br>  9. Tag blog posts at social bookmarking sites. Sign up to Onlywire.<br>  10. Add pictures to your blog with appropriate keywords.<br>  <br>  You can do this all tasks yourself if you are well known online website marketing if you are novoice you can hire a Internet Marketing company who can do this all tasks for you with cheap fee plans.<br>  <br>  Otherwise I'd suggest you to hire a Internet Marketing services provider company who may help you to generate a good traffic. I know a company www.magicsolv.com, I found it best for me.<br>  I hope this will help you.<br>  Good luck!!|`|5rYChsWFaa	Content is the first part of promoting your website.  If you don't have good content, you're not going to get people to convert on your website.  Good relevant content also gets you good ranking with search engines and will get you listed faster.<br>  <br>  A great way to build links to your website and to get traffic going there is to utilize social networking sites like facebook and myspace to post content about your website and links back to your home page.<br>  <br>  Another way to do this is to utilize social bookmarking websites like digg.com, technorati, reddit, delicious, and all of the other hundreds of sites out there.<br>  <br>  Now, you can go through and spend hours upon hours building these links or you can use a widely accepted solution that most Internet marketers use. I have used quite a few different products for this and have found Bookmarking Demon to be the best. There are other products but this is the best one to use for amount of links getting through and for not getting you banned from the sites. Very important.<br>  <br>  Also, you should check out Google Analytics and get your website setup with it.

Ao52XHjCaa	I work at one of those large accounting firms and I can tell you, accuracy is more important than being a math genius. In fact, adding numbers up fast in your head is NOT what you are supposed to be doing. You need to be competent in numbers and good at learning accounting rules. You'll learn about 1/3 of what you need to learn in college, 1/2 of what you need to learn by studying for your CPA exam and 2/3 of what you need to know on the job being supervised by a senior accountant.  Now if you are capable of catching the mistake I just made with my numbers and that mistake bothers you, you'll make an excellent accountant.|`|AA10392637	I am married to an accountant who is a controller.

And how about we string up President Clinton since he is the one that forced Fanny Mae and Freddie Mac to give bad loans to low income minorities because apparently if you don't have the money to buy a home, have bad credit and are a minority and the bank doesn't give you a mortgage the bank is racist.

Unless it somehow pertains to the position youre applying for. Be confident. Don't fidget. Be prepared with questions of your own to ask. Do a little background research on the company before you go in so youre prepared to answer if they ask. Have a firm handshake and be sure to make eye contact when talking to them. Don't slouch in the seat. Smile, be energetic, cheerful, friendly. Try not to let your nerves show. Be sure to send a thank you note. If you don't have time to mail one, email it. In the note thank them for the interview, you can also add in anything you may have forgot to say in the interview. All the other people they interview may be just as qualified as you are, so you need to find a way to make yourself stand out from the rest. and good luck!|`|AA10232243	The entire job interview process is just a personality test.

It is also very important to research the company before you go, they will usually ask you why you want to work there and you can use that opportunity to tell them the qualities that you love about the place of employment and how that makes you want to work for a company like that. As for why they should hire you, talk up your strengths that apply for THAT particular job. Let them know if they want a hard working dedicated employee then you are the person for them, that also lets them know that you are a good asset to their company and that you will bring good team partnership to the company.

Or you could apply for a credit card for bad or no credit which most likely will get you approved no matter what, but if you are a student you could get a student credit card which will offer you lower rates and no annual fees, check out www.fastcreditcardapprovals.com but if you have applied for different cards most likely you have been applying for the wrong one so make sure you apply for a no credit card which will have a higher interest rate with an annual fee but use it for a few months just enough to build some credit then you could get a better card and drop your first one.|`|Pjm9pg7iaa	Instead of the usual one-page credit card application, you can mail your complete financial information , including bank accounts and on-time utility bills, to Visa, Mastercard, AMEX, Discover.

Check your competitors and convey to your customers that they are still receiving a good deal on what you offer, and it is not you specifically, but the vendors that are increasing price levels.

Again nothing you have to do nothing special to get it - just answer that you got none last year and since you are eligible this year, you will get it.
UeLigNB0aa	If you checked the web site you know that the refinance option will only allow up to 105% of the appraised value. If your home is worth $135,000 x 105% = a maximum new loan of $141,750.00. It looks like your only option will be a loan modification under the Home Affordability Plan.|`|VpjQpAOYaa	Your only hope is to work with your current lender.  No lender is going to refinance you if you owe more than the house is worth, minority or not.|`|q0GK3a8jaa	Right now everyone is restructuring their mortgage loan programs.  I think that's why you have to wait for approval.  I heard there will be strict qualifications.  Like you could have never been late in the past, and the home must be worth more or the same at the time of purchase.  In your statement you say the value less than what you owe.  I don't know about that one. There are several other new rules as well. Hope everything works out for you.  Good Luck.|`|KWp6QuQWaa	It is going to be very difficult, nearly impossible for a lender to refinance your property given that you owe more than what the house is worth.  I strongly suggest you contact your lender and ask for a loan modification, explain the financial hardship, I have seen lenders modify a mortgage loan by cutting the interest rate in half, and even reducing the loan amount, making the mortgage payment affordable and helping you avoid foreclosure down the line.  Contact them everyday if possible, due to the high volume of pre foreclosure and foreclosure activity they are extremely busy, so call them consistently until you reach a solution.

The problem is that it is also legal for you to "void" any contract at any time prior to turning 18. WHich makes it difficult for anyone to enter into contracts with your business.

The amount of income you earn will be dependent on you and not what work is available. Most of the companies will have a fee to pay for the starter kit. The cost can range.

The starter kit for them was only $99.<br>  <br>  The best thing you can do is to follow your passion. If you're doing something you love, then it is definitely worth it.

Unless you have a few hundred million dollars to start out with, I suggest you not bother thinking about it.<br>  <br>  Now if you are talking about an insurance brokerage, that is different.  Are you licenced and experienced?  Have you a proven track record with any insurance companies?  They often provide financing, especially if you are buying an established office with clientele, and you have a sound business plan.<br>  <br>  If you aren't licenced with several years experience working in a general insurance brokerage, you have to get that background before can think of your own office.|`|jF1xH89Caa	You need to speak to these people.....<br>  <br>  *Find out what your minimum self insured requirement is in the sate of NC.|`|dyzUHrUVaa	If you wouldnt mind, what exactly are you asking here?

SO YOU WILL BE PAYING THE CLAIMS OUT OF YOUR OWN POCKET? Anyway, these are very different ideas about both. If you are wanting to be a broker, you will need to an property and casualty insurance license most likely and most states, you would need to have had this for at least two years to qualify for a brokers license, and if you qualify for this, you can apply for a franchise agreement with some of the major companies like Farmers, or Allstate. If you are doing the other in these two examples, I have a better sure fire way for you to invest your money in a more modern company and a much safer return on your money, email me and we can talk.

XxUsLqXRaa	A lot of people think that you can buy a foreclosed home by paying only the amount of the remaining balance of the original mortgage.  That isn't true.  Foreclosed homes ARE typically priced for a little less but it's because banks arent in the business of selling real estate and would just as sooner not have ownership of a bunch of vacant homes.  They price them in a range that would entice buyers, but they arent going to let anyone buy it for too much less than the fair market value.  Unfortunately, many foreclosed vacant homes are in sad shape either because the previous owners were pissed when they had to move out, or vandals made their way in at some point.  Dont assume ALL vacant foreclosed homes are in poor condition though.  If you want to find a gem, sometimes you have to dig a little deeper and search a little longer.  Also, keep your eye out for homes that are listed as "short sale".  In this situation, the bank has agreed to take less than what is owed on the property rather than stand their ground and let the house go into foreclosure.|`|AA10006961	There are good deals to be found.<br>  <br>  This site will give you a brief rundown on the pros and cons of foreclosure/reo investments.  <a href="http://actioninvestornetwork.blogspot.com/2008/03/reo-foreclosure-step-by-step.html" rel="nofollow">http://actioninvestornetwork.blogspot.co...</a><br>  <br>  Also, you can go to Foreclosure Home Investors at <a href="http://www.ForeclosureHomeInvestors.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.ForeclosureHomeInvestors.com</a> and browse through some foreclosure REO listings.

KxxkOPeTaa	Jason -<br>  <br>  It all depends on what type of service you are looking to receive. If you are good with numbers and navigating the IRS forms, then you can try one of the tax software packages. But some people just don't like to even think of numbers so one of the chains (JH or HR, etc) could help you out. Depending on how complicated your return is, you could be charged $300 or more and people usually say the service is hit-or-miss. You may get a really good tax professional who has been working there for years or you may get someone who just took one of their "quick study" courses and is doing taxes to earn a few bucks. Either way, the company will stand by the return.<br>  <br>  You can also hire a CPA - there are many CPAâs online that you can use. Plus, CPA's are probably the most knowledgeable in terms of tax law and regulations and during this time of year, many charge extremely competitive rates - sometimes better than HR / JH or the software packages.  In fact, the one I use (linked below) each year only charges around $50 for my return â itâs really a great deals compared to the other guys.
bFRVSDteaa	In past years, NY state has often delayed paying tax refunds when cash was tight.  This is nothing new.  NY state will never admit it, but the consensus is that this is related to the end of the state's fiscal year. The NY state income tax refund flow tends to drop to a trickle in February and March, and then go back to normal after the new fiscal year starts on April 1.  The larger your refund, the more likely they will delay payment.<br>  <br>  I hope it's different this year. I'm waiting for mine, too. Good luck!<br>  <br>  And yes, I agree that the best solution is to adjust your withholding or estimated tax payments next year so that you owe NY state a small amount in April, rather than making them an interest-free loan throughout the year.|`|DAMZKbpDaa	NY will send your refund when they feel like it, and there's nothing you can do.<br>  <br>  Except change your withholding information with your employer, so you don't get as much a refund.|`|ej9ijnS7aa	Some states have their refunds on hold because of the state budgets.

Never waited this long before, at the most 2 weeks after federal.  I know many people that filed the same way I did and after I did and got theirs.  I also know someone who got a much bigger refund than me and got theirs in a timely matter.  So I don't know how they are picking and choosing who they don't send them to.  It obviously has nothing to do with the amounts or whether or not it was done in February or January.  By the way nothing complicated on my return and nothing new!  Maybe someday soon, I feel the same way you do they sure do take it fast enough and if you owe them I would hate to see what they would do if you told them you would give it to them when you feel like it.|`|ScrQiiGxaa	I e filed NY state return on Feb 8th, and on Feb 27th received a letter from Dept of Taxation that they cannot send me my return because they cannot verify my wages and earnings.

The people filing in February are getting their refunds in a timely manner.<br>  <br>  BTW- I changed my W4 a couple of years ago to get more in each paycheck through out the year, so I only get a small refund but as long as I don't owe anything I'm happy! After all of these problems I am glad I did that because I'd be mighty upset if NY state was sitting on thousands of dollars of my money with no word on where it is!

Keep it simple and your student or audience will remember. Layout your flyer simply so that it is easy for the eye to navigate to the important parts. You don't want to overwhelm the viewer with so much to look at that they lose the focus of what the flyer is really about.<br>  <br>  2. Bold, Italic, Color Text<br>  <br>  Change up the color of the text, but do make sure that the text is visible and easy to see. Bold the text that is important. Italicize other text that adds even more emphasis to your message.<br>  <br>  3. Color<br>  <br>  The ever important color scheme. You want your colors to work together, but you also want your colors to call attention to your message and to catch the eye of viewer. Keep colors in line with your message. If you have a soothing message, use soothing colors like pink or orange. If you have a strong message, use strong colors like bright red or neon green.|`|GWCXuFknaa	<a href="HTTP://WWW.STYLISHDUDES.COM" rel="nofollow">HTTP://WWW.STYLISHDUDES.COM</a><br>  We are wholesaler of Nike Jordan and Other Shoes in China.

If you don't understand something - talk to your instructor.<br>  <br>  Yahoo Answers is not a source that should be cited in a report/essay. If it's a different kind of assignment, well if you just get someone else to do the questions for you, then you don't learn what you're meant to learn and you'll just have more trouble later on.<br>  <br>  Take the time to master the materials for yourself - it will pay off later.<br>  <br>  Your instructor should be happy to help you if you're struggling - that's what they're paid to do.  They may not be so happy to help if you've just been lazy and not read the materials/attended class - that's up to you to fix.<br>  <br>  If you really want to ask for help on this site, my advice is to have a go at the questions for yourself and then ask for feedback on here (eg "I think the answer may be xxxxx... am I on the right track?").  Then people like me would be far more likely to help you.

Although I havenât had extensive experience in office work, I am confident that I could bring a high level of efficiency and organization to the hospital. I have roughly three years experience in a retail environment, which has allowed me to do some office work such as shipping and receiving via UPS and answering multi-line phones.<br>   I am interested in working for a pet hospital because I have a love of animals and have my own pets. An office environment would be ideal for me as I believe that I have what it takes to be a great receptionist.<br>   In addition to retail experience, my studies in school will also be valuable in this position. As a psychology student, Iâve taken many courses in psychology, as well as an interpersonal communications course. This will enable me to communicate more effectively with co workers and pet owners who may be under stress. <br>   I would like to thank you for taking the time to review my resume and cover letter.

If they owner of the house isn't doing anything about it. Maybe you should really call the "tribunial resident act" bcoz your doing ur part and nothing is being done around the house. Or look for another house for the meantime. then move out when they least expect it coz that's unfair on u and ur partner. I'm in Australia but, if any of these things occur you can get help from the RTA (residentail tenancies agreement) and i found a paragraph which explains this :<br>   Repairs-"It is the ownerâs responsibility to maintain the rental premises in a reasonable state of repair relative to its age and the amount of rent being paid and in line with local health and safety laws"<br>  <br>  Clearly you have a point!!! I hope i could help you out more but I don't know nor have an idea who to call in the US with your certain situation. I hope this helped and good luck!=)
22bkUtWNaa	Renting is when you don't own the apartment or home, but pay the person who does month by month. What you should know about renting is that in the long run it is more costly than owning a house, partly because the money you spend is basically "thrown away" - it doesn't build equity (i.e. when you move, you won't get anything back) - and partly because monthly payments on a house could potentially be lower than monthly rent payments.<br>  <br>  But until you have enough money to put down up front for a down payment (usually between 10-20% of the house's total cost, so like for a $100,000 house, which is probably very small, $10,000 up front), you will probably have to rent.<br>  <br>  When you rent, you will have to sign a contract with whoever owns the property you are renting. That contract will have specific terms that you will have to follow. The most important would probably be about who pays the utilities and maintenance. Most renters have to pay for their own utilities, like gas, electricity, cable, internet, phone, and sometimes (but not often) water and trash removal. I have found that contracts that have the utilities included in the monthly price sometimes are not as nice as places where you pay your own utilities, but that probably depends on where you will be renting.<br>  <br>  When you rent, the landlord will usually ask for a deposit. This is used to pay for any damage YOU incurred while you lived there, the remainder of which will be returned to you at the end of your contract. So for example, you pay $600/month rent and your deposit was $500. You drop your hair straightener on the carpet and damage it. It costs $30 for the landlord to get it fixed. At the end of your contract, you will get $470 back instead of $500. Usually this money only pays for the damage YOU do. So let's say the toilet clogs and needs to be replaced. The landlord will likely pay for that themselves, unless you somehow did this. Usually it's just old plumbing, and the landlord will know this.<br>  <br>  Sometimes the landlord may also ask for the first and/or last month's rent when you first sign the contract.<br>  <br>  Other things decided in the contract are when you will have to pay your rent, what the penalty is for paying it late (usually a fee - mine was $25 for the first day late plus $5/day for every additional day), how long the rent is (6 months, 12 months, etc.) and what to do if the place needs maintenance. Since you don't own the property, the landlord is usually responsible for fixing broken toilets, getting rid of rodents or bugs, etc. Sometimes they require the renter to purchase things like lightbulbs, sometimes not. <br>  <br>  When you go to look for a place to rent, you should try to find something that is well within your price range. If you can save money by doing laundry at home, you might skip a place with a washer and dryer. Don't go into a contract that you can barely afford. You should have a nice cushion. <br>  <br>  Some great places to look for places to rent are craigslist, facebook, and actually just by driving around the neighborhood where you want to live and looking for "for Rent" signs. If there is a number on the sign, you should call and say, "Hi, I'm inquiring about the house at 'such and such an address' - can you tell me more about it?" Remember to ask about all the amenities, if utilities are included, how much the deposit and rent are, and how long the contract will be. <br>  <br>  My husband and I are renting now until we can afford a down payment. Food for us costs about $180-200/month (but then again, I'm pregnant, food prices vary depending on the state, and you might eat more/less than us). Electricity costs about $100/month (we use electric heaters, though, and don't pay for gas). Our internet costs $30/month (we got a good deal with a local satellite company, NOT comcast). <br>  <br>  So, no, it's not hard to rent. You just have to make sure you can afford the place where you will live, and afford means there is a cushion. <br>  <br>  Good luck!

You likely have a level 1 licence, in which case you will probably start out in the neighbourhood of 9 or 10 dollars an hour.  You need a level 3 insurance licence (you earn that by passing CAIB 1 (or Fundamentals of Insurance), 2, 3, and 4) to run your own office, or be a manager for somebody else.  You need a level 2 licence (CAIB 2 and 3) to be able to work without supervision in an office, and to sell outside the office.  Note, CAIB is not the only road to licencing, there are equivalents, but CAIB is the route I took.<br>  I retired as a broker in Manitoba.  My base salary was $30,000.  I received commission on every personal and commercial lines policy I wrote, and auto policies other than basic Autopac.  I received commission on basic Autopac for clients I actually brought into the office.  There was no limit to my commissions, and, in slow months, no minimum quota to meet.  I did receive a commission cheque every month, so I did not too bad financially.<br>  There are many similarities between BC and Manitoba as far as auto and personal lines insurance.<br>  For new brokers, the greatest part of your salary is your base salary, and you may not even qualify for commission from the agency owner until you reach a certain level.  After a few years experience, your commissions for writing business become an important part of your income.

What I would do is look online at apartments.com and get an idea of what you have to choose from. Most ads include enough pictures to get an idea of what the property is like.

They would be happy to shop around for you.|`|Uopgj45zaa	nope|`|dd6rgtL7aa	Well, apartments complexes typically don't have any idea of what is available until about 60-90 days before the current tenants move out date. Thats why people are saying this. It may work very differently in a college type setting though.

The reason it is 3-4 weeks is because that's how long you would normally have to give notice on your current tenancy.|`|JSFCkne8aa	It depends on the number of apartments available.  I think that most landlords would not hold an apartment for more than a few weeks at most.|`|eilBhJYOaa	Maybe back in the day...now, highly doubtful.  There are waiting lists, but that's different.  Look like 60-90 days before the move date.
LpVwWJVsaa	Nope, by no means is it unreasonable.  I manage a 140-Unit apartment community and we do our inspections every six months.  Other posters are correct in saying that properties tend to make it about service requests, we tie ours in with the time change and check smoke detectors, fire extinguishers and change furnace filters.  It's not a bad thing to get into the habit of because then you know what's going on with your property and how people are maintaining it.<br>  <br>  Make sure that you give your residents at least 24 hours notice in accordance with your state laws.  Some states require more notice, so I would google your landlord tenant laws for your state to find your information.|`|6sJhoXAAaa	Even government agencies (HUD, Public Housing, Section 8, etc.) only inspect theirs once a year. Yes, I think every six months would be excessive according to that.|`|AA12291184	nope.<br>  <br>  these days you wnat to know what's going on.<br>  <br>  that sounds like a plan.|`|jJwuMTSqaa	Heck no! I would inspect it more than that. You never know what goes on when you are not there.|`|sr7jX2wYaa	If  it  is the  lease  agreement No  Not at all. & if  more  Landlords  took  this approach, they would have less damage to their  property. because it could be  within the  lease  the  6 months  inspection clause,any  significant  damage  to property is  grounds  for eviction  with the  30 day notice  in accordance  with  the law & also it  gives  the  tenant  the opportunity  to let  the landlord  know of  any problems they are  having  with the  rental property. I would  out of  respect give a 3 day notice to  the tenant prior  to coming so they can be there when you inspect, since they are paying  rent & it is considered their  residence,  that you will be  entering. Legally your  property, but  their residence, so  don't  forget that. Plus  as I stated  you can inquire if  they are  having   any maintenance problems  that are your  responsibility to fix, so  that  those  conditions  do  not get out of hand & cause extensive problems  from  landlord  neglect*|`|RZzMse3Haa	Every 6 months is not to bad.  Some may consider it excessive but it would not be illegal.  Once a year is standard by Section 8 standards.<br>  <br>  Every 3 months and every other month as some are suggesting IS excessive and bordering on illegal.|`|7h0qfos1aa	It's a little much, depends on your turnover rate and how many units in the property you are renting out. Whatever makes you feel comfortable.|`|SMvTq4fZaa	A lot can happen in 6 months...so I'd recommend an inspection every other month or so.|`|3Ze4nR9Caa	I work for a property management company in California and we only do periodic inspections once a year, unless we have been notified of a specific problem.  Personally, I would not appreciate a landlord that felt the need to check on me every 6 months, especially if there weren't any problems at previous inspections.  I suggest you scale it back to once a year, and do "drive by" inspections every couple of months.  Just drive by the property and take a quick look at the exterior and the landscaping - if you don't notice any problems outside, assume they are maintaining the inside as well.  Also, try enlisting the help of a neighbor.  Ask someone who lives by the property to keep an eye out for you, and call you if they notice any  problems or issues.|`|88fe0e7dd70efba47ddc995964dd5cb8aa	No, that is really reasonable. Some landlord's don't say they are "inspecting" how the renters are taking care of the property. They tell the renters that they will be periodically (every 3 months or so) scheduling maintenance visits to check the heaters, appliances, smoke detectors, electrical outlets, look for leaks, etc.<br>  <br>  This makes it about maintenance instead of checking up on the renters. Then it isn't personal and you get less resistance.|`|tXg464rTaa	No, it isn't unreasonable or unrealistic.<br>  The inspection can be performed after you provide a written notice to tenants alerting them to the inspection ahead of time. The inspection should reveal how the property looks and operates - defects are obvious. Be careful - don't confiscate anything without a lawyer present, in case of liability issues.|`|Y8MZCLIQaa	Not at all.<br>  Most places I've rented at do it every 3months.<br>  A lot can happen to your house in 6 months. I think it would be best to do it every 3months. If after a few times checking all seems well then you may see fit to extend the time to 6 months.|`|QjgxH7Ouaa	NO, it's not unreasonable.  Just yesterday I went to my house expecting it to look like the $95,000 house I had left 3 years ago.

Assuming 310 million Americans, cutting a check for $1,000,000 to each would be over $300 trillion and right now, all the money being handed out is less than 1/100th that amount ($3 trillion).<br>  <br>  Having said that, handing a $10,000 check to each American would not solve the problems.  $10,000 would not buy a car, so the auto companies would still fail and throw 100's of thousands out of work, $10,000 to each American would not help with the mortgage and foreclosure problems, further stressing our real estate markets and banking system.  The money being spent is targeted to areas of the economy that are struggling and in danger of failing - a stimulus check of $10,000 that is not targeted would not help.|`|AA12045604	There are about 300 million Americans...<br>  So, $300 billion would give each American about $1000.  <br>  <br>  I agree that the bailouts are ridiculous and being used for absurd corporate bonuses for the stupid CEOs that helped get us into this mess to begin with.

Clear out any personal effects, and rent part furnished. Start with a 6 month Tenancy (suggest you use a managing agent to make sure potential tenants are checked out).

Since you are not pressed for money--hang on to it and rent it for a year--maybe the market will turn around and you and yor sister will have made a decision.

If those tenants were making such a horrid noise, it was time to involve the police, since they are in charge of enforcement of noise violations.<br>  <br>  If you get a lawyer, he will either be honest and tell you that you have no case, OR he will charge you by the hour, let you go to court, and then have you lose.|`|l9lrT7bfaa	Have you got copies of all your letters?

How did the landlord answer your complaints? Who is "everybody?" There's more to the story you're not telling.|`|PxoKseAiaa	I doubt you have a case.  The landlord is not responsible if someone is hammering or cussing at you.  Call the cops when things like that happen.  <br>  <br>  You are not going to get your entire rent back..that is ridiculous.  Also, why would the landlord pay YOU to move?  I could see if he was being nice and let you out of your lease without penalty, but pay you? What universe does that occur on? LOL<br>  <br>  Don't waste your money on a lawyer.  Use it to pay what you owe the landlord.  Otherwise, you will find yourself in small claims with the landlord suing you.  Perhaps if you talk with him, you can come to an amicable agreement.
AA10944287	Easy. Resolving a conflict btw a pt and dr. The dr. orders two units packed red blood cells. The pt refuses the blood due to religious reasons. Advise the pt that albumin may be used or iron to substitute the packed red blood cells.Then suggest to the dr. that the pt would accept the albumin or iron. <br>  <br>  One way to respect a pts privacy is when you enter the room do as many tasks as possible. Give meds, change dressings, and reposition the pt for comfort and ask if they need anything else. And ALWAYS knock before entering.|`|SSD3jj7baa	resolving a conflict with another co-worker?<br>  in interviews I always look for answers of independence like "if I had a conflict with a co-worker I would talking with my co-worker to see if we could settle it. If that doesn't work I'd bring the problem forward to my supervisor."  This shows your independence and also reflects well on your personality.<br>  <br>  Respecting privacy is very important especially in a hospital environment.  For instance you do not want to go talking about a patient and use the patients name saying something like "Miss Whatsit has a huge wound and it leaked all over me she is so gross!"  Remember respect, remember your role as a care giver and I mean it's not rocket science they are people and it's hard enough for them to submit to the care of another individual.  Use room numbers so the patients name isn't thrown around all day, I mean if you are at the RN station or something, the Patient in 312A needs a blanket.  make sure you say patient cause they are not a number.  And some facilities actually do condone using the last name of the patient.<br>  <br>  OH ok a conflict with a patient do whatever you need to do or say to make them comfortable.  They are the customer.  Apologize and make sure you resolve the problem accordingly, you may want to let your Team Leader in on the situation and let her know what happened and what you have done or are doing to resolve the issue.  Don't take a patients discomfort to heart, they are in the hospital for a reason and would probably rather be golfing or shoping, so just have an open mind and be understanding.  Use words like "I" or "you" very carefully and Practice your smile ;)|`|AA12200264	Do you have children, or have you ever had to look after any ? If yes then you have already done some 'resolving a conflict' work, as for respecting privacy if the situation involves sensitive issues, then best as i can suggest is using a private room or area to talk to people, if it's to defuse a situation then best thing is to remain calm while repeatedly trying to persuade the person to calm down or move away from the situation.

fa49fc3460e0c0dfb37b6cda6aa1dd56aa	I'll never understand why tenants refuse to take their contract seriously.  You agreed to pay a certain amount for a certain time.  If you fail to do so the landlord can and should sue you for breach of contract.  Not liking your place is not a legal reason to break your lease.

fqycKwuQaa	Credit cards are good to have if you are responsible and use them wisely when needed, also getting the right card means a lot because now days there are cards that could give you cash back, miles and points every time you use them but again you have to have decent credit. The cons of credit cards are that if you use them and don't pay on time you will be billed late fees which could add up, also if you use them often and just pay the minimum you will be paying them for years because most of the time credit cards just ask for a small payment of 15-30 bucks which just covers the interest payment so make sure to send a bigger payment when you get your bill or even pay it off at the end of the month. <br>  <br>  when looking for a card these is what I look for no annual fees, low interest rates, rewards. <br>  <br>  check out www.fastcreditcardapprovals.com here you will be able to compare them side by side on rates, fees and rewards.|`|0yqQg9CXaa	When I was 18 I got 2 credit cards.<br>  One for gas, and one for groceries.<br>  I paid in full each month to avoid paying interest.<br>  I ended up getting 800+ scores in just two years.<br>  <br>  I had no idea paying in full would be so good for my rating.<br>  Never pay interest and make the scamming banks rich.<br>  People that carry balances end up ruining their scores - some ruin their lives.<br>  /|`|bTQTzsbGaa	Don't do anything over the phone with anyone.

Something you did that was exciting and maybe a little scary.

4ooXYuYFaa	I always tend to think of these things as a Return on Investment. I think this depends largely on what you want to do. I would think about how much that potential career will pay you over the course of your life and decide if it is worth it. To me, paying to attend Harvard to become a social worker is a poor return on the investment. But going the cheap route to become a surgeon may not be a wise move either. I certainly think $30,000 for a 4 year degree is VERY reasonable. Leverage can be used very wisely and is a good way to achieve certain things. If you wanted to put that same $30,000 into a car as an "investment" I'd tell you that's a poor choice, but I think any reasonable expenditure on college is very smart. If you want to pay only cash, it could take significantly longer and put you behind others your age.|`|CL9zXIA7aa	I guess it depends on what kind of degree you plan to get. If you plan on getting a degree in a high paying profession (finance, engineering, law, medicine, computers, etc.) you can probably take on a lot more debt than getting one of those "feel good" degrees like in the humanities, social sciences, music, etc.|`|YL8R3Jubaa	Hi, it does matter how deep in debt you go and starting out after college with a big college loan to pay off is not the best way to start a career.  These days some students do have $30k or more in loans.  If you are going into a high paying field and are confident that you will get a job right away (Engineers, Doctors, Dentist, Consultant, CPA) then you are probably going to be ok.  Otherwise, you should rethink your plan.|`|JXJvxhZPaa	It depends on the school and what you are going for.  I know surgeons who took on $200,000 in student loans, but that's what they had to do to get through ten years of college.  Law school can also be very expensive.  I was able to make it through a bachelor's with no debt and I think ideally that should be the way to do it, but obviously it isn't always possible.|`|DorePwVOaa	There's actually a calculator to figure this out: <a href="http://www.finaid.org/calculators/loanpayments.phtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.finaid.org/calculators/loanpa...</a><br>  <br>  It depends on how much you'll be making when you get out of school. If you use the calculator for a lot of different situations, you'll notice that it usually shows that you should only take out about as much as you expect to make for your starting salary. So if the starting salary in your field is about $40,000, you shouldn't take out more than $40,000 in loans.

xjazE0xmaa	The first step is to have them appraised again.  Their value could have gone up--22 years is a long time--or down (if they acquired scratches, etc. over time).  When you schedule the appraisal, make certain the gemologist can also give you the diamonds' Rapaport value.  If possible, pick an appraiser who isn't interested in buying your jewelry--you are more confident it's a true, fair appraisal.<br>  <br>  When you attempt to sell a diamond in good condition, a diamond dealer is likely to make an initial offer of 60% of the diamondâs âRap value,â according to the Rapaport Diamond Report.  The report is updated each week and covers diamonds of varying color, shapes, grades, and sizes up to six carats.  Most people selling their jewelry don't know their diamonds' Rap value, but if you got it during the appraisal, you have better negotiating power.<br>  <br>  Often the dealerâs offer is far less than the diamondâs appraised value.  This is because the appraiser is aiming to give you the diamondâs retail value.  If one of your diamonds' retail values is $10,000, the appraiser is likely to appraise it at $10,000.  The Rapaport value of the ring may be $4,000.  It may be $5,000.  You simply wonât know unless you see a relatively current Rapaport sheet listing the qualities of your particular diamonds.<br>  <br>  Hypothetically, letâs say one diamond that was appraised at $10,000 has a Rapaport value of $5,000.  That means the wholesale price of the diamond would be $5,000.  The average dealer would offer you 60% of the $5,000, so you should expect the dealerâs initial offer to be $3,000.  As you can see, it simply doesnât matter to the dealer that your ring has been appraised at $10,000.  To the dealer, there is no reason to expect the diamond to sell for more than the Rapaport value.  <br>  <br>  However, there are plenty of reasons a diamond could sell for less than the Rapaport price.  A diamond could be chipped, have scratches, or otherwise show damage.  These things happen.  And dealers know it.  So, if a dealer offers much less than 60% of the Rapaport value on a ring you thought was in good condition, ask why and listen with a skepticâs ears.  <br>  <br>  If you aren't getting the kinds of offers you epect from jewelers, go online.  People resell jewelry on Craig's List, eBay, just about everywhere.  Make sure to include a very nice photo of each ring and a nice, clear photo of the appraisal.  <br>  <br>  I hope this helps.

Es3Yu63maa	Do not listen to Erica's junk. cashcrate gives u maybe $0.25 per offer and there is maybe 50 offers altogether.<br>  if you want money, work for it. if your in debt, then im guessing your at least 14 and are qualified to get a job. if you are under that age, you could always try shoveling snow or babysitiing, or working for someone and getting paid by the hour, you could even rummage through your house and sell some stuff on ebay, or pick something up at a thrift store to sell.<br>  whatever you do, do not even try cashcrate. erica told me the same thing, i fell for it and signed up. sure, it works, but it gives you barely any money and you have to give out your phone and address.
4MypYVHYaa	I would never offer more than the asking price of a property. The bank has said they will accept $240,000 for the property and now you want to offer $275,000. <br>  <br>  Your agent is not giving you good advice at all. This person is simply looking to make sure the sale go through at you spending more than you should. How do your agent know that the bank have multiple offers? The bank does not disclose to real estate agents any offers they have on a bank owned property nor how much the offers are for. <br>  <br>  I would offer the bank the asking price to include that they pay all closing cost and then ask for the right of first refusal in the offer.<br>  <br>  If the bank has agreed to a short sale of $240,000 then they have decided that this is a price they can live with.<br>  <br>  I hope this has been of some use to you, good luck<br>  <br>  "FIGHT ON"|`|MGXHme6Qaa	if the house has multiple bids on it, yes ask more than what they want if u want them to pay closing costs.  :)|`|0011Smdtaa	DO NOT offer more than their asking price.  That is lunacy.  If they are asking $240,000 and you think its worth $290,000 then smile and make their full offer at $240,000.  We bought a little bungalow for a rental investment at christmas.  They were asking $78,000 and we offered $60,000.  They ummed and ahhed for a bit [about 5 days] then accepted our offer.  It doesn't hurt to be cheeky but I can't see the sense in going over someones asking price.|`|7b273a170e665a98a68fec3b0465485baa	you are going to pay more than their asking price?, my advice to you is to look on the COUNTY AUDITOR website for whatever county this home is in, obviously you want to look in the real estate section of the auditor's website , it will tell you want the bank took the house back for and the yearly property tax, plus your realtor could be full of b.s. about a 50% chance of that, when you make your offer be careful that is not any back property tax and/or back utillities as well , there will be no way for you to know that so all you do is when you submit your offer, say seller is responsible for all closing cost, back property taxes,back utillities, and offer is subject to home inspection.  and whatever else you want them to do.  good luck to you, and if you don't get the house in these times you'll be able to get another one very easy.|`|N38pJIt9aa	don't get too emotional and get your judgment blurred. i understand you like the property, but don't pay over the asking price if you can afford not too. it really is a buyers market now.<br>  <br>  there always would be another around the corner, if this one doesn't go through.<br>  <br>  if you must $250k max.<br>  <br>  best of luck.|`|qTwc6HNRaa	If you really want this house, then do your homework. I hope you are working with someone that gives you great advise ( good real estate agent ) ask how long this property has been on for. You can also ask if there are other offers on the table the bank is considering. Never offer more than the asking price. Always pay your own closing costs. Be ready to wait three months for an answer from bank. BE PATIENT. Short sales always take time|`|1zBBSgQsaa	Tough call. Depends on how many bids are on the table. $35k over asking price on a short sale is rather steep. IMO, put in a bid for the asking price. If it is meant to be in that house it will happen. If not, there are plenty of homes on the market, especially with the crisis we are in. I am looking at homes today for myself and girlfriend, and we have a policy that the right home will come. Paying over asking price with this housing market is just ridiculous to us. Best of luck with the home search.|`|MMeHdlu2aa	This is a case where you must trust the advice of the agent you have chosen to represent you.  Only that agent has all of the information from the market place you are in plus has contact with the listing agent representing the subject property to get a feel for what it will take for you to get the property.  <br>  They have priced the property aggressively to attract multiple offers and in that situation, sometimes asking for credits may weaken your position.<br>  The most important thing is for you not to make any offer you cannot close on because having the down payment and closing costs are not a contingency in a CA purchase contract and you would lose your deposit if you cannot close because of a lack of funds.<br>  Keep in mind you will get a $8000 credit on your 2009 tax return for a purchase made this year, so perhaps you could get an advance from parents or someone for closing costs with the agreement to pay them back from your tax return next year if need be.<br>  Good luck!
AA10464818	The good thing with Adsense is that it is not solely based on your traffic. You can have little traffic but if you have good paying keywords and highly responsive audience, then you can still earn good money<br>  <br>  To increase Adsense revenue, experiment with the factors below<br>  <br>  1. Responsiveness of audience to the ads = A travel website that provides information on travel to Spain will attract visitors looking for ways to arrange their travel and spend money on their vacation to Spain. Your site provides the info, but the ads will provide hotels, travel agencies, tourist destinations, car rentals -- ads that are likely to get the attention of the users of your site. This is a site that will most likely do well with Adsense.  However, if you are a gaming website where the main purpose of the user is to play games on your site, then Adsense will not perform as well.<br>  <br>  2. Ad format = some types of ads do better than others depending on your content and layout. In our case, large rectangles in the middle of the content is the best, while leaderboards do not generate as much as income. Skys are the worst for us. Experiment and measure the results via channels and see which formats work best for you.<br>  <br>  3. Ad placement - check Google's heat map as they have tested where the best placements are <a href="https://www.google.com/support/adsense/bin/answer.py?answer=17954&ctx=en:search&query=adsense+heat+map&topic=0&type=f" rel="nofollow">https://www.google.com/support/adsense/b...</a> <br>  <br>  4. Ad colors - sometimes ads blended into the content works wonders, but sometimes ads that contrast your site colors work best<br>  <br>  5. Number of ad units on a page = we are allowed maximum of 3 ads + 1 ad links + 1 search box on a page. Maximize the allowed number based on the resulting look of your page (you don't want an overkill of ads). Users going to your page and reading your content may ignore the banner or rectangle at the top of the page, but may click on the ad at the bottom of the article<br>  <br>  6. Smartpricing - the big unknown in Adsense. No one knows how this actually works. But it can affect the pricing of the ads on your site. If the advertiser paid for $0.50/click - but your site is smartpriced - then the cost may be discounted lower (e.g. $0.25). So you may try to develop a site based on high paying keywords but if smartpricing gets to you, then you may not get as much per click as what you are expecting from your keywords.<br>  <br>  Here is Google's explanation of smart pricing <a href="https://adwords.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=9562&query=smart+pricing&topic=0&type=f" rel="nofollow">https://adwords.google.com/support/bin/a...</a><br>  <br>  Google's smart pricing feature automatically adjusts the cost of a keyword-targeted content click based on its effectiveness compared to a search click. So if our data shows that a click from a content page is less likely to turn into actionable business results -- such as online sales, registrations, phone calls, or newsletter signups -- we reduce the price you pay for that click.|`|9ozLBt5Qaa	Have you placed you blog on classifiedsfor people to see it?

Q5BM2POnaa	Well in most states a landlord is required to give 24 hours notice before any "inspection" unless it's an emergency situation (such as a gas or water leak).<br>  <br>  They don't really have the right to just come in and see if they can bust you for something.  Just like the cops, they really need probable cause.<br>  <br>  I don't see how the size of your bed constitutes a lease violation, and if I were you, I wouldn't have signed a lease if it had stipulations like that.<br>  <br>  If there is a renter's board in your city, you might talk to them.  Better yet, just move out and find a reasonable landlord.<br>  <br>  When I was a landlord, I never made random inspections for no reason.  Most of my visits were after the tenants called requesting some type of repair.  The only exceptions were after I decided to sell the house and I needed to see what work would need to be done to make it sell-ready.  In those cases, as required by law in California, I always gave 24 hours notice.<br>  <br>  A landlord who enters your place without notice every 2-3 weeks is invasive and controlling and not someone I would want to give my hard earned money to.<br>  <br>  If you can, find another place to rent and move out ASAP.  Assuming you've already paid the last month's rent, make sure you don't pay him more than you owe as he also sounds like the type who would nickel and dime you on your security deposit refund.<br>  <br>  --------------------------------<br>  <br>  I don't think basic cleanliness is a landlord's business unless it's so bad it's attracting bugs or rodents.  Whether you wipe down the stove every day or not really shouldn't be his business.<br>  <br>  I also don't think moving furniture in a furnished apartment is a big deal either as long as you move it back when you move out, you don't damage it moving it, and wherever you are moving it to is protected from the elements.<br>  <br>  It sounds like your landlord is either just nuts or specifically has it out for you.  Either way, I wouldn't want the stress and hassle of dealing with him, so I think I would just move.<br>  <br>  Most landlords aren't like that and life's too short to put up with people like that.<br>  <br>  -----------------<br>  <br>  To address your last part, "remove" has a clear definition; to remove from the property.  If you simply moved it from one part of the property to another, and will move it back before you move out, that is clearly NOT a lease violation.  If the lease said tenant must leave all furnishings in their current exact location, then he would have an issue.  Since it doesn't say that, he's in the wrong.|`|ZaadvJAXaa	Generally, they are supposed to be looking for violations within your apartment, such as dirty stove top, or oven, dirty floor, nothing stored in furnace room, which is a major violation.  Also, they will probably check to see if doors and hinges are working and closing properly, kitchen appliances as well.  Sounds as if you have a nosy landlord.|`|fCF02V87aa	In my buildings--I have an exterminator in every six weeks and I or my Super is with him in the units. I give my renters 48 hours written notice--and most tenants are prepared and cleaned up for the visit. I take a five minute walk through and that's it. How you place your furniture is none of his business-and most people don't live in museums so without notice may be unprepared. I think he is being invasive and dis-respectful of your privacy if he has no valid reason -like maintaince-to enter so often. EDIT-to clarify--I dont inspect per-say--i notice things quickly--leaks--missing smoke detectors annoy me.I  hate roaches--so if I walk in and the place stinks -i get a bad impression--An un-swpt floor is far from a violation--you live their its not a showcase. It sounds like he is lucky to have you-my visits are scheduled by slipping a note under doors 2 days prior and when I knock on that day if no-one answers we will enter to do our maintaince. I wonder about two things here--perhaps this guy has a compulsive cleaning dis-order-like Felix Unger-or may-be he is interested in more then a business relationship. Stop being so submissive to this guy-it probably gets him off---perhaps their is a man in your life to step up and set this nut straight.

In my case IRS disallowed my claiming my younger brother since he lived with Dad at a different location. You more or less have to prove total support.|`|MmTe8W8uaa	UPDATED/MODIFIED ANSWER:<br>  <br>  You have informed me by e-mail that the brothers and your mother live with you.  This logically means that the brothers and your mother are living in the same household and the father is not.  <br>  <br>  If the father is living with the brothers, then he has the right to claim them IF the mother does not.  Even if you support them, you do not have the right to claim them if any parent of them who lives with them wishes to claim them.<br>  <br>  If the father does not live with the brothers and either you or your mother (or both) cannot be claimed by any person (other than yourselves), then it was illegal for your father to claim your brothers. <br>  <br>  The IRS tends to favor the parent who lives with a child over all other persons.  Therefore, if your mother is also the mother of your brothers (but not if they are your half-brothers who are not related to her), the best option may be to have your mother claim your brothers (her sons who live with her).  Otherwise, disregard this paragraph.<br>  <br>  THIS PARAGRAPH NOT CHANGED: The reason that your return did not go through is because she e-filed (or attempted to e-file) an electronic return.  Only the first return that claims a person can be e-filed (electronic).  Once any return claiming a person has been filed, even erroneously, all subsequent attempts to claim that person must be made on paper.<br>  <br>  If the mother decides not to claim the brothers AND you cannot be claimed by any person other than yourself AND the father does not live with the brothers, then you probably had the right to claim the brothers.  The woman preparing your taxes SHOULD have done a paper tax return for you and filed that with a claim for the brothers on that paper return.  However, if she has already e-filed an electronic return for you, it is too late now.  Therefore, you should now prepare a paper Form 1040X.  Claim your brothers on that Form 1040X.  The amounts that the woman who did your taxes originally used go in column A.  The amounts you are adding go in column B.  The total, in other words, the amounts that should have been entered originally, go in column C.  List your brothers' names, social security numbers, etc., in the space under line 33 on that 1040X.  Enter the number of them in the applicable square on the right.  As a check, this number should match what you entered in space 29B.  When you finish the form, sign and date it, and mail it to the IRS.|`|fyWbMXOHaa	If they have custody you can only claim the children with their permission. So if they are divorced and he claims them on a year he is not supposed to and your sister gives you permission, then you can. If they are married then you have to have both parents permission. Now you may or may not get your money back, but a little pay back may be to inform the IRS that the children reside with you and not him. If he claimed them for EIC, which is what I think you are referring to, he will have to pay the money back. Make sure you can prove through school records, insurance records, doctors, whatever that they live with you. Have your sister give you legal guardianship to avoid this kind of thing in the future.

You should also make sure that there is no graffiti on your buildings in your units or complex.<br>  <br>  One way individuals can often help in this process is to park outside the apartment complex on a weekend night, Saturday is probably the best night for this.

457db30f68586ffe5e0ebc94a4dba769aa	Your mother needs to check with her employer/HR office.  They should be able to assist her with that question.  It depends on how their specific benefit plan is set up, because there are different ways it could work.<br>  <br>  Some plans required that you verify full time student status once a year, and usually check during fall semester.  However, other plans will send out a notification, and require that you show proof of full time student status for one semester during the calendar year.  (There are other ways too, but the ones I listed are 2 of the most common examples.)<br>  <br>  The best thing to do is have your mother confirm with her benefits office in advance.  Even if you don't get the answer you're hoping for, its still better to know in advance, which would allow you time to line up other coverage such as Medicaid.<br>  <br>  Additionally, if you haven't already, you'll need to confirm how what insurance coverage your baby will have when he/she is born.  Many insurance plans will not allow a newborn grandchild to be added to the grandparent's plan, unless the grandparent is going to adopt and/or have legal custody.<br>  <br>  Its important to prepare in advance for what insurance coverage your baby will have, because your baby will have bills of his/her own for the delivery/hospital stay.  If the father has coverage of his own (rather than through his own parents), you could inquire about whether the baby could be added.  Or inquire about the possibility of Medicaid coverage.  Whatever the situation, you'll want to gather information before the baby is born, so that you know what paperwork you have to fill out after the birth.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

Lets look at it another way. You have been notified that the landlord may not be able to perform on his contract with you and you want to know of possible remedies to protect your interest in this contract right?<br>  <br>  Real estate guy is giving you an angle that isnt protected by law but something you should try. If they have trouble doing that then look for another place immediately and move. <br>  <br>  Get it in writing that they won't secure the deposit in escrow so when you move and IF (most likely they wont but you never know) they file against you then you can countersue for the deposit. <br>  <br>  Having been on both sides (never a landlord in foreclosure)it has been my experience that the courts will slap you both on the wrist but in the end their action will be squashed along with yours and the difference of whoever owes who (deposit subtracted from rent)will be awarded. Be aware that if it goes all the way to that then it will show up on the owing party's credit as a judgment. So if it goes this far bring a cashiers check for the rent and tell the judge (do not get a pro temp judge as they are lawyers and not real judges and on matters like this are not as familiar with nuances)you have it if he has a cashiers check for the deposit. He might pull your case aside so you can try to get it through your landlords head that he is going to lose unless he drops it or goes to the bank and gets you cashiers check. Then when he gets back wth cashiers check you can ask the court to withdraw the suit.<br>  <br>  I have done this exact thing with a landloard then with a tenant over damages and both times we avoided it going to a judgment. This may or may not work but if some of the pieces work then use them. Good Luck|`|tCIUbIlSaa	There are rights for tenants as well when a landlord is losing his/her rental property.

AHCelSY1aa	Yeah.  Big time a**hole.  I'm shocked you even stuck around.  Do not worry.  You are eligible for unemployment benefits since it was a "constructive termination."  Meaning you were not fired for "willful misconduct."  However, you must have worked a miniumum of 26 weeks in the last 18 months (even if it was at 20 different jobs) to be eligible.  The best of luck!  Let me add.  If I were this company I wouldn't contest your claim if you are eligible.  What you experienced definitely falls under an abusive environment. Name calling big no no. And the "slap me" comment?  Was he saying for you to slap him or he was going to slap you?  I hope he meant he was going to slap you.  BIG NO NO.

Usually bond holders also lose all their investment since deposits do not cover the assets.  <br>  <br>  In the case of large banks, there may be some sort of agreement between the government and bond holders (probably a percentage haircut agreement) to try to reduce the systemic risk.

AHCelSY1aa	It can take upwards of 4 weeks for them to contest.  Here is how it works.  You file the claim.  The employer is then sent a notice that X employee filed and you are receiving the benefit.  They then have until whatever date is on the notice to respond to contest the benefit.  If they do not contest by that date you would think it is over, but it's not.  They can contact DOL U.I. and they refer the employer to the claims investigator handling the case and an extension can be given which happens to frequent for my taste. Unfortunately, unless you are keeping on top of it you will not receive any notice your unemployment benefit has now been denied. To do this when you file your weekly claim make sure you go into your payment history to make sure it was released for that w/e period.  If on any particular period it was not released contact the U.I. office immediately since it may have been denied due to the employer's argument which would have to meet either the "willful misconduct" criteria or they can prove you actually resigned and were not terminated.  In the event this happens immediately contact the "legal counsel's office" of your states department of unemployment office to obtain there address and fax number.  Under the Freedom of Information Act you are able to obtain any statements and/or documents your former employer submitted.  There is a fee for these documents (per page) and it takes upwards of 20 days from the day you make the request.  I do not suggest you wait to receive the documents since you normally have only 7 days to submit whatever proof you may have to counter argue your former employers argument, but with these documents in your possession it will assist you if the claims investigator still files in their favor and you select to go to a fair hearing.

If you elect "married filing separately", then you report only your own income, but you cannot claim her at all, because married persons are not allowed to claim their spouses when filing separately, so you claim only the exemption for yourself.<br>  <br>  If you married in 2009, and were not married at the end of 2008, then there is a remote possibility that you might be able to claim her as a dependent for 2008, if she lived with year for the entire year, had either no income or an income less than $3500, could not be claimed by any other person, received over 1/2 her support from you, and meets various other requirements.  If you married in 2009, and were not married at the end of 2008, then you file for 2008 as either single or head of household, even if you are married now.
TdrgZwnoaa	Craigslist is in deep shyte with the Federal Regulators because of their personal columns and members exchanging sex for money. Chances are that Craigslist is going through their system today making ''corrections''. They could lose their Internet status as a re silt of the fact that they have ignored repeated warning from the FCC and other regulatory bodies.|`|Svanlzg7aa	I agree with the above poster. A couple months ago they busted a prostitution ring in the town next to where I just moved from in Florida, that used Craigslist to advertise their services.
49740c9daeea677fc86801fb2b3f41deaa	Appraisals are not public information, even if you knew it was appraised you would not know for how much.    If you are looking up the value for property tax it has NOTHING to do with actual value.<br>  <br>  Those numbers are calculated based on several factors and tax laws, literally made to stay low when housing spikes, as it did a few years ago.    It is not one of the numbers you need, it is not used at all in the appraisal, as it is not associated.|`|JXJvxhZPaa	The FMV isn't always accurate, so just because you found $44,800 as the fair value doesn't mean that is the house's true fair value.  You should have your realtor look up recently sold homes similar to the one you are considering to see what the market looks like.  Also keep in mind that the $44K figure may not include any improvements or upgrades made to the home in the past year.|`|4UBxVIYFaa	Municipal tax assessment FMV's are notoriously inaccurate.  You are advised to not even consider such a value in relation to making an offer to purchase.  You should engage a real estate buyer's agent, who will provide you written evidence of recent and comparable sales prices to guide you in determining an offering price.|`|AA11616170	January 10th 2008 is very long ago.  Ask them for a fresh appraisal before making an offer.  Can you check the homes fair market value for similar houses in the same area?  If the figures you quote are correct, your first offer could be below 40,000.  I can't answer your question about FHA, but a phone call might give you the parameters for approval, or perhaps you could check online, in FAQs.
K45ZTwryaa	In terms of certifications, I would recommend sticking with the associate's degree.  I doubt the other program is ABA certified and it is unlikely to carry any real weight in your marketability as a paralegal.  In corporate practice, it would carry no weight at all for me if your resume came across my desk.<br>  <br>  For large law firms and mid sized law firms the market is currently pretty bad for most paralegal fields outside of litigation.  Even with litigation paralegals it is fairly difficult but not impossible to get an entry level position.  You'll want to circulate your resume to a few placement agencies for both fulltime and temp positions.  It costs you nothing and they are networked into most of the large and midsized law firms.  The entry level salary for paralegals varies depending where you are and what field you are entering but it ranges from about 24k-36k.<br>  <br>  I couldn't disagree more with Helen's view towards being a paralegal.  Her explanation is contradictory.  I know several former paralegals, myself included, that saw being a paralegal as a natural progression in making an informed decision about whether to pursue a law career.  It places you in a realistic position to know what a law career really entails which is something to which the vast majority of students enrolling in law school are completely ignorant and one of the main reasons that lawyers are among the most dissatisfied business professionals in the United States.  It is actually kind of mind boggling that so many people would invest well over $100k on a professional degree from a position of almost complete ignorance but that is what a lot of lawyers did.  You'll also get practical experience in law that you are unlikely to ever receive in law school if you ever do decide to pursue a law career.<br>  <br>  Seasoned paralegal's (5-8 years experience) depending on the area of law can draw base salaries as high as over $80k and over $100k if they become a paralegal manager in a large law firm.  That doesn't include overtime which is often available in abundance and I have known some paralegals who have earned over 120k in income with overtime.|`|AA11292270	I have honestly always thought that being a paralegal was the ultimate dead-end job.  You never graduate to being a lawyer--there is just no upward path for you.  And in this economy, heck, the lawyers themselves are getting laid off for lack of work, so you're completing for jobs with the younger lawyers.  Honestly, if I were you, I would do something else.|`|WYjbuu6saa	You are going to be wasting your time if you only get an Associates degree - employers (usually law firms) want employees with Bachelors degrees.  Certificates from "Legal Assistant Programs" aren't worth the money they are printed on - they are a SCAM.  <br>  <br>  Warning!  Jobs in the field of Law are drying up FAST!!  This is not a good field to invest in!  Many reasons.  Main reason?....We simply have WAY TOO MANY Legal Professionals - we have a GLUT!  ("Legal Professionals" includes, but is not limited to:  Attorneys/Lawyers, Paralegals, Legal Assistants, Legal Secretaries, Bailiffs, Court Reporters, etc, etc)<br>  <br>  So.....even IF you finish your studies, you probably won't be able to find a job when you are done.  The law schools know this, but law students are easy money for them - a law school has to make very little investment in a law student - the law schools know that the economy/market is SATURATED, yet they continue to churn out graduates.  (Which is a crime as far as I am concerned.)<br>  <br>  There aren't enough jobs around in the field of Law and many young, newly graduates are finding that, instead of working as a Lawyer/Attorney, they have to work as a Paralegal, Legal Assistant, etc, etc, just to keep their bills paid <THIS will be your competition.<br>  <br>  Suggestion:  Consider and and look into the field of HEALTHCARE! <This is where the jobs are! and scholarships!<br>  <br>  Good luck.

Verbally agree on a price per month and whether or not you have to contribute to utilities, food in the fridge, etc. It's not worth the time to have a lawyer draw up a renting contract that a court isn't going to care too much about anyway.|`|AA11215123	ahhh...

Study some online rental agreements and adapt them. <br>  <br>  Sit down with them and hammer out the details.<br>  <br>  Remember that as their child you are living in their house and they may veto some of your actions, but you should do all your own laundry and cleaning in your living area. Don't try to bar them from entering, but do ask for the respect of a knock and notice. Don't do anything that violates the law or their moral codes.<br>  <br>  Don't forget to turn over at least 25% of your gross pay to them and add extra if you use their high-speed net and cable TV.|`|aAGcYAsNaa	First thing is se if it's legal to use the basement for living space: you could end up costing your parents thousands in fines and penalties, possibly even a vacate order.
AA12065007	Assuming your talking about chapter 7 you have a choice of either giving up the property or reaffirming the debt.<br>  <br>  If you reaffirm the debt you get to keep the property at the same interest rate and payment you had before, just be sure to call your lenders and make sure that they continue to report to the credit bureaus because if your don't your accounts will read as "Included in bankruptcy" even though your still paying them.<br>  <br>  This is the fastest way to reestablish your credit after a bankruptcy.<br>  <br>  Now on the other hand if your tanked in your home and vehicle (owe more then their worth) you might want to consider simply letting them go back.<br>  <br>  Good luck.

You would be dependent on their return if you lived with them for more than half of 2008 since it looks like you did not provide more than half of your own support and you earned under $3500.<br>  If you are not a dependent of your parents, you may qualify to be a dependent (as a qualifying realtive) of your boyfriend - if you lived together all year and he provided over half of your support.<br>  If neither of these situations apply to you file as single and claim your own exemption.

Then you will have the option of rolling it over into a traditional or Roth.|`|RdPSaSVJaa	If it was me, I would roll it over into a Roth IRA.|`|XZtQ9BSbaa	I dont know where your from, but where I'm from, if you earn extra money and have to pay tax on it, you don't pay tax on the WHOLE amount, you pay tax only on what cash is over a certain limit. Say you have to pay tax if you earn over $3,000. If you earn $3020, You pay tax on $20, not on $3020. Similarly, if you choose to invest your money or whatever, and if you are lets say for example taxed on the returns, lets say for 400k the cut of tax is 30% and for anything over 400k its 35%. You pay 30% tax on 400k, and 35% tax on 1k. Thats how it works, so choose where you want to invest it, don't touch any shares with the current economy and don't risk putting your money in any mutal fund or anything, If I were you i would buy something, an asset - incase of difficult times.|`|YL8R3Jubaa	Roll it into an IRA at a discount brokerage firm like Schwab, Fidelity, Vanguard, TD Waterhouse.|`|AA10834046	You cannot roll it into a Roth without paying taxes.  <br>  <br>  If there is less than 1k dollars they may force you to roll it or take it.|`|LOrFtSCHaa	you should wait for 1yr then roll it over to your new 401k

ltXxNfwRaa	I completely understand your frustration... but it is definitely not a good idea to not pay your amex!<br>  <br>  I worked for them for almost 6 years... i talked to thousands of people just like yourself with the blue card.  The only way you could have gone to a defaulted interest rate is if you either didnt pay on time or went over your limit... if they lowered your line of credit and that caused you to go over, they are more than willing to adjust your rate appropriately (keeping in mind they can see your last year of history and weather or not you were in fact on time other than that).<br>  <br>  You dont want to start missing payments just out of spite... if you do, that can badly affect your credit... it all gets reported and I've seen some pretty bad credit in my day.  Just do the minimums on time... it might take you a while to get back on your feet, but think of how much better it will be to start off with clean credit instead of letting it go now and having to build everything back up from scratch!|`|QsVMeaPXaa	No, you cannot just walk away from a debt. (if one becomes disabled one can stop paying cc's as they are 'judgement proof'). The company can take you to court, it will ruin your credit standing. <br>  Initially I'd call them, explain your circumstances and ask for your interest rate to be dropped (seriously, this can and is done frequently).<br>  Or go to a credit consolidation company and have them work with the companies.  What they will do is negotiate to lower your interest rates and total up the amounts from all the cards you have and put it into one managable monthly payment.  You will save your credit history, rating that way. :)|`|5BTKscZraa	Even if they went under they would just sell your debt to another creditor.<br>  <br>  Why not pay it at all?

Now is not the time to buy a home, you will have a difficult time finding a mortgage even with ten percent down. I have a friend who is a mortgage officer and says that even with 700+ credit and a stable job, it is nearly impossible. To really help you to make a decision I would need to know more about your situation. Do you have car loans, credit cards, other debt? What credit scores are we looking at? Annual income? Another important factor is an emergency fund. Do you have money saved in case of job loss? If so how much? In order to make a fair decision, I would need to know this. But based on what I have, I would say pay off the student loans, and save money in an emergency fund. A home can wait for a little while.

I average around 2,500 dollars every month with it.

Should your recordkeeping not be sufficient, you will be bombarded with endless  so-called freebie offerings.  And there's the added bonus if you are able to bring in other new candidates to this program.  So, if you do not want to keep strict track of such offerings and do not have others to recommend, then the overall pay per hour for all your survey taking may prove to be of little value for all your efforts.<br>  <br>  Good luck!
AA11215123	It seems valid. It doesn't forbid you to leave but you'll have to pay rent. So you moved out on the 24th, which means you simply owe for 10 days rent. I don't know where you come up with owing for February and March, when you say the black-out period ends on February 2nd.<br>  <br>  However, I notice you didn't give proper notice. By not giving notice by the first of January you wind up owing for the month of February. Both parties are owed at least a full rental-period notice.<br>  <br>  You were given absolutely no notice at any time whatsoever that there was any damage alleged to the apartment below? Just suddenly he tells you about it long after you're out?<br>  <br>  You owe for the former, but I's argue the latter.|`|AA10045620	You did not abide by the terms of your lease.  From the sounds of it, your landlord is letting you off easy for not having to pay for March's rent.|`|PxoKseAiaa	Your agreement is valid.  Doesn't matter if there are spelling or grammatical errors.  If that were the case, imagine how many leases could be voided! LOL  <br>  <br>  You agreed by signing the agreement, that you would not move during a certain period of time.  You breached that agreement by leaving during that time. End of story. You owe the money.<br>  <br>  As for the damage, you would need to talk to the landlord about that.  Was the shower overflowing when you lived there?  <br>  <br>  Expect to be taken to small claims or tenant/landlord court if you don't pay.|`|3yrpDNavaa	1.  The fact that it was not drafted by a lawyer is irrelevant.<br>  2.  The fact that it contains grammatical errors is irrelevant.<br>  <br>  Now, that being out of the way, the issue is what constitutes proper notice on your part.  For a month to month tenancy at will, you must typically give notice at least 30 days in advance of the next rental due date.  Obviously, from the way that term is written, the agreement is that you would stay in the unit, and pay rent, at least through March.  (If you give notice anytime in February after February 2, that notice would terminate your tenancy on April 1, using the 30 day rule, presuming rent is due on the first of the month.  See how that works????)<br>  <br>  Sorry to say, but your landlord is correct on this one.  In fact, my interpretation of the lease term you cited actually obligates you to pay for February AND March.  Your landlord is actually giving you a break.|`|zuGKIWfNaa	I'm not a lawyer, but it seems valid to me. The fact that it contains grammatical errors doesn't make it invalid, neither does the fact that it was not drawn up by a lawyer. A valid agreement is one that is signed in good faith by both parties and which does not call for illegal or impossible activities.<br>  <br>  You signed a legal agreement that you wouldn't move out in February. Then you moved out in February. You violated the terms of the lease that YOU had agreed to. IMO, you are subject to any penalties agreed upon in that lease.

MmTe8W8uaa	1. Only the value at the time of the death is a non-taxable inheritance.  The $8000 increase in value is taxable.  The tax on that $8000 might be more than $1400, so I very much doubt that you are entitled to any money back.<br>  2. A 1099-DIV form is for the dividends earned in the most recent year.  Any money shown on a Form 1099-DIV after 1997 was taxable and would have been even if you had done everything correctly.  None of that money was part of your inheritance.<br>  3. A 1099-B is for selling an investment.  Only part of the money is taxable.  The amount invested in the shares that were sold is called basis and is not taxable IF you fill out Schedule D correctly.  The gain (increase in value) is taxable.<br>  4. If you were improperly taxed on non-taxable money, fill out a 1040X form for the year(s) for which you were taxed on something that should have been nontaxable.  If this relates to 1099-B income, attach a correct Schedule D for the year in question.  Mail the 1040X to the IRS.  You might be able to avoid paying more installments on that money.  However, it may be too late to receive a refund of what you have already paid.|`|32zBW5uCaa	You were not taxed on your inheritance.  You were taxed on the gains from the investments.  You owe the money.  And no you can't get the $1400 back.  You are fortunate the Feds didn't slap you with interest and penalties which could have left you owing megabucks.
aJVJspUIaa	No, they can't. If their bill was for 1400, then that is all you have due to them.  I would contact your insurance company. Your ins. company has to pay you what it would cost to make you whole again, so they can't take the $$$ back.  You could also cancel all work and request the entire amount be returned to you.  You would be much better off finding someone else.|`|JTKCPNnjaa	If you have a contract with them for the renovations, they are entitled to their profit. There will (should) be a cancellation clause in the contract that spells out how it would be canceled. If you only received a quote from them, then you probably don't owe them anything.<br>  <br>  In short, if you signed something you owe them for what you signed up for. It may mean paying for the quote or their lost profits, but really depends on the contract.<br>  <br>  A lot of contractors try to bully their clients when things like this happen (especially in this tough market). Just because they say you owe them doesn't mean you really do.<br>  <br>  Best of luck!
NG6eeCfuaa	Negative, you will have to use the 1040 or 1040A to report the miscellaneous income.|`|MmTe8W8uaa	No, Form 1040-EZ cannot be used in this situation.  Three forms are required and should be completed in this order:<br>  1. Either Schedule C or Schedule C-EZ <br>  2. Schedule SE<br>  3. Form 1040|`|hA0QBgDCaa	Your son needs to file form 1040 with Sch C and Sch SE
027e4b603b33c0e5ccaa877273bf5a75aa	A parent has a legal obligation to support a child.. and thus cannot or should not charge "rent" to a minor. <br>  <br>  HOWEVER the issue is that his parents can legally claim all his income as theirs. Therefore, if your friend is paying less than all his income to his parents as "rent" it is "legal" if you use the opposite terminology that the parents are allowing him to keep some of his earnings.<br>  <br>  Alternatively if he is emanicipated then they can charge rent.|`|AHCelSY1aa	His mother can make him do whatever she wants although I think that is real b*tchy of her.  I can see her trying to teach him responsibility, but are you saying he is to pay the entire rent?  I find it highly unlikely he will be earning enough to cover it.  Legally she CANNOT kick him out and she is responsible for him until he is 18 years old.  Unfortunately, although this is the law there are many heart breaking cases where the parent(s) has kicked out the underage child. Personally I think those parents should just hang themselves as they don't deserve to live.|`|WYjbuu6saa	YES....<br>  but it depends upon the circumstances.<br>  <br>  I have a friend that makes their 15 year old pay rent ($100/month), but that's only because their child refuses to help out around the house (do any chores) and he has a really good-paying part-time job.<br>  <br>  So......it depends on the circumstances.<br>  <br>  And....people.....there are TWO sides to every story!  Parents today can only do so much.  I have seen a LOT of teenagers that just assume they are so entitled.....meanwhile, the parents are working themselves to the bone.  We need ALL the facts here first.|`|AA10834046	It's probably not legal.
