20080928142847AAcN2Np	Beauty & Style;Fashion & Accessories	Interpretation of overheard convo of how I dress?	I'm 20 years old and in college. 4 friends and I were hanging out when I got a phone call and went into the other room to talk. I overheard my friends talking about clothes and one said that they thought I dressed sophisticated. I thought this was a compliment but then she went on to say that I always dressed nice and put together but kind of older looking. Later I jokingly asked if they said I was old looking earlier and they said "I think our exact word was sophisticated," and went on to say that I just kind of dress teacher-like (I'm an elementary education major). One pointed out how I wore cute shoes to match my outfit. I was wearing denim trouser jeans a plain red shirt and black pointy toe flats. I didn't think this was dressing old? What do you think they mean??? lol It bothers me a little, but compared to what my friends wear I feel that I look nice. I do admit in the winter I wear sweaters and stuff but is that mean teacher-like?  I mean my mom always taught me that I should like nice and presentable in public!  I hardly shop at places like American Eagle anymore because I feel a lot of that stuff is cut small and looks young, and that I shouldn't be looking like a teen anymore.  What's your interpretation of sophisticated/old/teacher-like??? lol

I absolutely hate the skin on my face, sometimes I wish I could just rip it all off and it would grow back all new and clean.      I have a ton of freckles and spots on my face - mainly on the top of my cheeks, and my nose. Don't tell me they look cute, because I think they look dirty on me.       My mom is European, and my dad is Indian, which means I have white skin, and black hair.. so people think I am Asian, but then I have freckles (which most Asians don't have) so I look like a total freak!

Now on both sides of my nose, it's all white and bleached so I look even weirder! What can I do to get rid of my freckles and spots & please no complicated home remedies! Thank you, xoxo.

20090203064132AAa3kwc	Beauty & Style;Makeup	Where do them cream and sh*t go once it's on the skin?	the answer to this might be pretty obvious but i was wondern why do you need to RE-apply topical creams (im talking about of any kind, antibacterial, corticosteriods, lotion, whatever). i mean once the cream goes on it should just stay on the skin shouldn't it? but it doesn't, it disappears after a while and when that happens we need to put another coat on. so where does it go? does the cream slowly absorb through the skin, goes into YOUR BLOOD and eventually gets excreted out of the body? even things like skincare lotion? and does that mean the same applies for makeup, shampoo, tattoos, or ANYTHING that stays on the skin for that matter ? it just kinda grosses me out that makeup might get into your circulation after a long day.

20090203064438AA9tZHg	Beauty & Style;Skin & Body;Tattoos	Is the top of the bicep a good spot for a tattoo?	I'm getting my first tattoo on Thursday, the word "Courage" in a cursive script.  The only thing left for me to decide is where to put this tattoo.  I was debating between the inner wrist and the inner forearm, below the elbow (like where this one is:  http://www.bmeink.com/A80212/high/npyg-n...         But reading up, it seems like the wrist hurts, isn't as easy to hide as I thought, and has a slight feminine connotation.  The forearm spot might be too noticeable for me too, so I was thinking about sliding it up just a bit more so it would be on the other side of my elbow crook.  That way I can hide or show it depending on the length of my polo or T sleeve.  I can't seem to find any pictures of people having a tattoo in this spot, though I've found a lot of the inner bicep.        Just wondering if in your opinion, a tattoo here would look good.  Thanks in advance!

I'm not looking for criticism, just for the answer to my question. Thanks.      Ok, so I went tanning in a bed yesterday for 8 minutes and got a burn on my stomach, front hip area, and inner/upper thighs. If I put like a hand towel over that area (when I'm in the tanning bed), will it be ok for me to tan tomorrow? I'm also planning on just tanning for 7 minutes instead of 8 this time, until my burn goes away and I get a good base tan. Will this be ok???      Thanks! =)
