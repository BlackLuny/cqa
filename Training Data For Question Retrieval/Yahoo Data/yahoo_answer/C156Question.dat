20090220032443AA8Yuvb	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Am really confused about ttc ?	hello ladies, after 14 months of ttc, we got referred and due to my irregular cycles i was put on fertility treatment      now january was my first cycle of novladex (tamoxifen) which is supposed to be similar to clomid (i got massive headaches with clomid so was advised not to take it) but doctors said this medicine works same way like clomid      so everything went ok, took the med day 2-5 as per instructions, then we bd' loads at the right time, there were 2 follicles in the 12 day scan, both good size - my period was due on 16th and have done several tests - all negative !!!!       whats going on?? i definitely ovulated on day 13-15, because the day 12 scan showed good sized follicles and was then given injection for ovulation. so by day 28, i am either pregnant or not - if i am not then i should have got my period on day 28, which was like 4-5 days ago.... and did another test this morning - NEGATIVE again...      am really confused.... any ladies that can share any similar experience or have any idea what this means ??      i really appreciate your answers....thank you, april

20090220032853AALaFuP	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	My 19 month old keeps banging her head on floor and hitting - what should i do?	I have a 19 month old daughter , she has had a bit of a temper on her for a few months now but she seems to be getting worse not better   If she cant have something she wants or she is tired then she will deliberatly bang her head on the floor or the wall or even on me (sometimes really hard) , she will also scream real loud like someone is hurting her and she will often hit me really hard or my 4 year old son   . She will also pick things up such as toys and throw them at me or her brother   Now i know all toddlers go through terrible twos but she is not two yet and i am worried with this head banging and hitting - is this normal   I have to state for those fools on nhere- i do not hit my kids and they do not witness violence so the hitting is not through me   advice appreciated

He barely made a sound the whole time when usually he wakes up the whole house thus, waking up my irritating family. I feel so happy  and he even smiled at me ,AWWWW.    This is my first baby so I feel proud. He's a month old.   Maybe I should I celebrate but how?

I am writing on behalf of a very close friend    ( who has given me permission to ask for your advice )       After a number of dates and one night of passion Sarah discovered she is pregnant (about 6 weeks ) she is 35 and has her own house living in london.      She has told the Father who wants to keep the child, but Sarah wants to get it aborted as she feels this isn't the right time and has no desire to have a child as she is not married or in a stable relationship with this man      He really wants to keep it      She can't see herself as a mum right now as it will totally turn her life upside down, she also feels guilty as there are so many people that would be so grateful to be in her position. And does want a child eventually, just not like this.      How can you make such a huge decision and know you have done the right thing?      Any advice would be very helpful that i can pass on      thank you

Should your breasts feel sore and hurt to touch because mine do and have been for a couple of weeks, I am tired most of the time, slight back ach, pee all the time etc is this normal. I am taking folic acid to help with getting pregnant, eating healthy fruit and veg and we have regualr sex. What could this be. I don't want to take any more clomid if I am pregnant but how soon can you do a test?

There has been no bleeding but I'm quite worried.
20090220041448AAHDgsD	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Please help me...I am very stressed and need advice before I go over the edge?	Let me give you some background on myself. I am 17 and a senior in high school. I have roughly a 3.5 gpa and have been accepted to every college I have applied to and so far have recieve an offer of 10k scholarship to one and 14k to another-with others to come soon. Okay so I get migraines 2-3x's/wk and get dizziness which causes my eyes to go black for 2-secs to a few mins. It makes it difficult to go to school so I have missed about 38 days so far this year. We are trying to get home bound (teacher comes to the house, my sister got it for a whole year for getting pregnant) but they are giving a tough time about it. We should know by today, the doctor probably will sign it. I am about to break though. My mother and step-father were talking about kicking me out of the house because this is causing them so much stress. They said they can't deal with me. I am not much more welcome at my dad's house as he gives my sister everything she wants and I end up with the short end of the stick--it would be even moreso now that the baby is there and is 10 months old. My sister came home drunk, did drugs, got pregnant, and NO ONE ever threatened to kick her out. Why is it that I get sick by something that I can't control and they want to kick me out? I can't work at your traditional stand up place. I've tried it. I almost passed out several times. What should I do? I am very upset by this. I think it may have just been better I was never born because neither of my parents have ever seemed to want me and when things get bad they always threaten calling the cops or sending me away or something. I am a good student and a good kid. What did I do wrong?

20090220040018AA5Vj7K	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Why do parents doubt their teens ability to help others?	I just ran across a post by a girl named Heather who likes to help others with their problems, give advice ect. Reading the comments, alot of adults said that it wasen't her place to offer help to others (you don't have a counselors liscense, no training blah blah blah...). It amazes me when I see all these comments that say "I want to die", or "which method of suicuide would you recommend", and it dosen't take a counselors degree to just talk to someone and offer advice. Do adults think that kids and teens just don't know enough? It is a rare gift when you see someone taking a vested interest in sombody's problems... A gift that dosen't need a degree, or a liscense, but a gift that will grow when it is used...
20090220041643AA3mTun	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	A question for teens about parental relationships...?	Some teens have a really good relationship with their parents/siblings. I applaud you for that. Now, for the other 90% of us, we don't often have the most stable relationship with our parents. We consider them to not understand us, irritate us, ect. Lately, I realized that I can avoid alot of confrontations with my parents if I didn't talk around them. Sounds harsh, but it works. I also realized that when my parents yelled at me, I could swing the tables on them and just say "I'm not going to talk to you if you're just going to yell". It's not easy, but if you can master this skill, you will be better off... Anyway, my question to my fellow teens is when you argue or fight with your parents, are there certain things that you do that give you an edge in the argument? Also, do you also not talk much when your around your parents?   Thanks   Cory

20090219230240AAB6YSE	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	How should i support my girlfriend who wants an abortion?	My girlfriend is pregnant. We are 18 years old and seniors in highschool, my girlfriend got accepted to an Ivy League university that she is suppose to be starting in the fall. She says a baby would ruin her future and is afraid her parents will be so angry that they won’t support her.  She has an Orthodox Jewish family who are pretty well off, and said her parents would never be happy with her having a child with me, I’m not Jewish and we’re not married and I’m not “up” to their standards anyway. She’s afraid to even tell them about the pregnancy even though she’s close to her family. She says she will have an abortion in a few days without even telling her family. I don’t know what to say. I really don’t want to have my entire life thrown away because of this, but I do not want her to get an abortion. What should I do? How should I support her?

Well I was talking to my mom this morning and she was saying that gma is getting too old and this is probably the last baby she will be watching. I know I want to have at least one more kid.  Right now we live with my in laws and plan to move out and rent in a few months. WE can no way survive on one income. So IDK how we would ever have another baby. I dont think I could have a stranger watch my kids especially when they are newborns. I would love to stay home but we just cant afford that

I took a dollar store pregnancy test today and it came up negative.  I'm going to wait one more week and then test again is AF doesn't show.  As you guys know my day 21 progesterone level was 8 so I probably didn't ovulate.  If my period doesn't come in the next week or two I'll probably have to take provera to bring it on.  I was hoping clomid would do the charm again, but it probably didn't.  All the best to everyone and congrats to jackie.

20090203124116AAxhd4C	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Would you keep using a baby item that was recalled?	For example.....Bumbo or Fisher Price Rainforest Play yard?  The reasoning behind the Bumbo was so stupid.....who would actually put their baby on anything inclined in the Bumbo....that's ridiculous.  My baby loves her Bumbo.  Now, I do see the reasoning behind the play yard recall but wonder if babies were put it there that were too big (higher than weight limit), etc. and if the play yard was put together right to begin with.  Sometimes those things can be so confusing.

20090220013905AA712CO	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	PLEASE HELP, How do we handle this sleeping situation w/ our 11 month old?	Lately we have rocked him for a little bit then laied him down so he could just cry it out.       Especally the last 4-5 nights, he has been waking up in middle of night (around 1 or 2am) to feed. He usually eats some solids around 6 or 7pm. He drinks down 5 oz of breastmilk. I will rock him a few min after that and lay him down. He wakes right up, so I pat his back some and leave the room.               He starts crying, HARD, sits up and vomits, lays down, cries, sits up vomits again. So now there is vomit all over his bed and him. My DH is holding him and I am changing his crib and clothes. DH rocks him for a while and lays him back down. DH pats his back.         Our son will lay there and make a large circlular motion w/ his arm rubbing the blanket. It is like he is trying anything to stay awake. He will twerl his hair or kick his feet.         We finally just let him be and he cried and rocked back and forth banging his head against the crib (there is soft bumpers) He did this for 15 min. He finally stopped crying and continued rocking.             Does anyone have any tips on how we can do this differently or better? What kind of things did you do so your baby went to sleep on his own?       thankyou so much

20090203123130AAnnjB4	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Why is he doing this crap?	My ex and I broke up when I was 5 months pregnant. He's almost 21 and his gf is 16. I honestly don't care about the break-up but, now he's being a deadbeat loser cause of his girlfriend. He claims to be Mormon but has this chick living with him. It's been like 4 months and they have lived together for the past 3, been engaged for the past 3, and saying "I love you" after 2 weeks. What's his deal and why is he bailing on his kid for this girl? Is it a guy thing or what? I know he's a ******* loser, but he so wasn't like this when him and I were together. He was really excited about being a father. He just completely flipped a switch and stop being the person I knew. Is this crap gonna last? Or should I just tell him to screw off if he's not gonna put his child first every time he gets a new gf? Do you think he got scared of being a parent and is now bailing?

20090203124804AAGoBO5	Pregnancy & Parenting;Baby Names	Names list? (revised)?	Ok I already have four kids called:       Lily Claire    April Vivienne   Tobias Max    Isla Sienna       They are aged 6, 6, and 3 years, and 7 weeks.       I realised that all their names have an i in them, and they all (apart from Tobias) have an L as well.    They are all very different names, but they link together quite well: April, Lily, Tobias and Isla. Know what I mean? So I want my fifth (and final!) baby to link with this pattern too.    Ideas:       GIRLS:    Imogen Amelia (Imo)   Talia Saffron      BOYS   Isaac Luke    Liam Jacob      Can you think of other nice names with the letter 'i' and 'L' in it?   Isobella is too similar to Isla
20090220033604AAMpTAp	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Has anyone seen the UK tv show 'bringing up baby'? I was horrified!!!?	I live in australia and it aired last night on the ABC. I really loved the concept of the show/documentary but was horrified at the woman that advocated leaving your newborn baby, that just arrived home from hospital, to sceam unless it was feed time and not to hold and cuddle it and to LEAVE IT OUTSIDE IN THE GARDEN IN A PRAM FOR 3 HOURS WITHOUT A PARENT!!!! Aparently forcing a routine from day 1, not feeding anymore than 4 hourly, not cuddling any more than is necessary, no eye contact, holding it away from you when feeding and leaving it outside by itself in a pram is supposed to make it sleep through the night by 12wks and makes the baby happier and content! What the???      It made me so mad i wanted to reach inside the TV and throttle the woman until she saw sense!!!   What on earth is this woman thinking!! Does it surprise you to know that she doesn't have children of her own?!       Thankfully there were two other women on the show that were normal and advocated bonding and cuddling and holding.       What do you think about this crazy womans method for 'bringing up baby' and have you seen it?
20090203123922AABdZLg	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Do you think this behavior in children is rude or acceptable?	Sorry in advance if it's a bit lengthy . . .      My neighbor has a 3 year old daughter. Sometimes when I'm outside talking with my neighbor, her daughter will be outside playing. I always say hi to her (the daughter) and she just looks at me and walks away. Same thing happens if I ask her a simple question "Is that your new doll?" Even if I compliment her, "I like your dress!" She just gives me this blank express and walks away.       Now, do you think this sort of behavior is rude or acceptable in children? I hear the argument from some parents, saying, "Well, the kid is just shy! That's normal." But I really think it's kind of rude. I think children should be taught to show respect, and that includes answering someone when they are talking to you. If an adult (or anyone) says hi, they should be polite and say hi back. If an adult is asking them a question, they should answer. I don't think that they should be allowed to ignore people like that.      **Let me just add that I believe in teaching our children never to talk to strangers, especially if the parents are not around.**       Now, I'm not going to demand my son to sing and dance and do tricks in front of people! But I do think it's right to teach him simple manners, and that includes not ignoring someone when they are talking to you, especially if it's just to say hi.      What do you think?

Seriously though, I really don't understand it as I have friends I've known for 15 years plus and I couldn't tell you what their middle names are, they're just not used.  Tradition here is to give the child a middle name of one of their grandparents, or just not bother.  Don't mean to offend anyone just want to know?

20090220023110AAFvJgf	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Brown Discharge when period was due, no cramps or blood?	My period was normally due around the 29th of the month but i had a smear test on the 16th January and the next day i started to come on and my period followed. I am normally on for a week. I had withdrawl method sex on the 8th February (i am not on the pill and haven't been for about 9/10 months) my boyfriend and i normally use condoms but had a moment of madness and this one time we didn't. I assumed because my period started around the 17th January that it was the same time this month (Feb as i am regular) So on the 17th i saw a little brown discharge and thought that i was coming on, but i have been like this now for 4 days and still no sign of any blood and i have had no cramps either which for me is a sure sign that blood will appear, all i have had is few little spurts of cramps on and off the week before my period was due but they only lasted about 5 minutes and then went away and they were not consecutive and i've not had any since. I just wondered if anyone else has had the same problem and whether or not it could be a sign of implatation bleeding, although i have had no other symptoms except feeling really tired, which i have been putting down to work. I don't want to take a HPT just yet incase my period suddenly arrives but just wanted to know if anyone else had experienced the same problem.       Thanks
20090220021746AAnpVQe	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Is smoking catnip dangerous?	I know that catnip tea can be dangerous in early pregnancy in large quantities.  However, that seems to be specific to an "infusion" (i.e. tea), and I'm at 14 weeks, past a significant risk of miscarriage.  And obviously smoking cigarettes is dangerous, but last I checked that was mostly because it restricts blood flow, which is an effect of the nicotine, not the smoke inhalation.  Does anyone have a definitive answer here?

Well I just turned 16 in January and I was wondering if this would be a good time to lose my virginity to my current bf of 3 months. Our relationship is pretty stable, we've talked about sex openly many times(talking about condoms, what's okay, whats not okay to do in the sack, no pressure)and he seems to care about me alot. But from what I've asked him, this is his 2nd serious relationship and this is my 4th. I'm just wondering if he would be okay taking this step and the same with me. Am I young? Is it the right time? Anything would help me out. Like past experiences. Please I've been wondering about this for awhile and would I somehow start to become clingy or have my feelings change? Also I've learned to accept that not all relationships will last but what would happen if I decided to have sex for the first time. Thank you :]

I asked this question earlier but only received one response, please answer as I am very worried and stressed about this situation and I know me being stressed isn't helping my boys any.      Hi, I just found out that my twin boys are sharing a placenta and are having a hard time getting blood for the both of them. I am 22 weeks and have been put on bed rest, does anyone know of anything or anyway I can lay down or anything like that, that will provide a better blood flow to the placenta and in turn help the babies receive blood better. I asked the doctor, a specialist, if this meant that the babies had TTTS and he said that no it doesn't, that confused me a little. I have another appointment with him in two weeks to check up on the babies.      Has anyone ever experienced this before and if so how did everything turn out for you? Were your babies healthy?      One baby weights 13 oz and the other weights 9 oz. Does anyone know what the average weight of 22 week twins should be?      Thank you in advance for all of your answers.

20090220064520AAyyfQp	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	I'm going out of my mind.?	My son is 6 months old. Breastfed, refuses bottles entirely... went 22 hours without eating when we tried it, then i gave in. We've been making attempts at solids for 2 months (since 4 months) but that's a no go... one spoonful then the lips are locked turning head and crying. I go through that twice a day, and might get him to eat 4 spoonfuls. He still wants to nurse every 1-3 hours all day, all night. He doesn't really nap, unless he falls asleep in the car or nursing. He cries himself to sleep, for nights and naps even while being held and rocked, or in the car... unless he falls asleep nursing. I'm going our of my mind. We try to start his routine for bedtime at 7:30, to have him in bed by 8:15-8:30.   between the time we get him asleep and the time he wakes up for the morning (5 am) he wakes 5-7 times. I don't get sleep. he doesn't get sleep. no one is happy. i'm going crazy on 3-4 hours of sleep a night. There was one point (at 3 1/2 months) that he slept through the night. then a growth spurt hit and it was all downhill from there. my doctor says all of this will pass, but i am going crazy. i want to give up on the breastfeeding, so i know he gets enough, but he comes to work with me 5 days a week from 8:30-2:30. i don't know what to do. i feel like quitting breastfeeding (or swithing to expressed milk) so that i can have help, i love him so much, but he is driving me out of my mind. i cry all day. i feel like this father is useless. though he tries to put him back to sleep when he wakes up at night. all he really does is rock him or shhh pat him for an hour then comes to get me because the baby won't fall back asleep unless i give him a boob.

I'm seven months into pregnancy, and I have been experiencing fatigue or something, that's so bad, that I feel now I really have to drag myself out of bed in the mornings, and recently I have been barely making it to work or appointments on time. It wasn't like this earlier in the pregnancy, so I'm just wondering about it. Tonight at work, I had a tired spell so strong, that I felt like I could just fall down on the floor and sleep for days, right there in the noisy place that I work. And I was awake most of the day too!!!       Does this happen with pregnancies? Is it something I should worry about? or is it just because my due date is getting so close?

20090220075736AAOZFS8	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	My hormones caused probs with me and my husband this morning - should I just suck it up?	I'm 10 weeks pregnant and highly emotional. Needless to say, my morning didn't start off on a good foot. Our cat (which my husband had before we started dating) insists on meowing/crying at 5:30 am every single morning and my husband knows how I don't want to lose any sleep before I have to get up before work, but he still allows our cat to come into the room for the cat's comfort. I always feel like the cat's comfort is more important than mine.  So that's one.   The second is, we were talking in bed about a friend who followed a woman across the world because he didn't want to lose her and when I asked him if he would do the same for me if we were in their position, he said no. The third is him telling me he forgot something in the house because he didn't want to leave it with me because he "KNEW" that I would forget it. The fourth thing was while we were driving to work in the car he looked at me and said "Hi Grumpy".       Ok, is it just me, or was it an insensitive, unromantic, crappy morning? I just needed a little bit of love this morning but I felt left to the side.

Then people from my school found it and bullied me SO much for it. It was horrible. I wrote my own song called Not Me Never Me and put that up. I couldn't go anywhere without someone saying oh its the girl with the geeky smile (a line from the song) and I HATED IT. Some people STILL go on about it now.   Anyway. I deleted all those videos and my Youtube Channel.   Then about a month ago me and the same friend decided to put more videos up.   I did and I was really happy because people were saying I was real good and things like that (on youtube).   Then 2 b*tchy girls from my year found my channel with about 17 videos on it.

20090220073818AAVzfeL	Pregnancy & Parenting;Baby Names	What do you think of these female names?	What do you think of these two female names? I just came across them.         Héloise   Origin: French   Meaning: Sun   Origin: Germanic   Meaning: Happiness + woodland   Origin: English   Meaning: Happiness + woodland   Pronounciation: (EL o eez) The h is silent.      Additional Info: English name with strong French and Germanic influences. In origin it was most likely a compound name, composed of the elements 'heile', 'happiness', and 'witu', 'woodland' or 'wide', 'broad'.      Info I gathered: There was a French Nun by the name of Heloise who also was a writer, scholar, and abbess. Her letters  to Peter Abelard are among the best known records of early romantic love.      Peter Abelard was a medieval French scholastic philosopher, theologian and preeminent logician. The story of his affair with and love for Hélo?se has become legendary.         Eloise is a variant.               Mélodie   Origin: Greek   Meaning: Melody   Origin: French   Meaning: Melody   Pronounciation: (MEH lo dee)       Additional Info: Derived from the Greek 'meloidia' (melody), which is from the elements 'melos' (song) and 'aeidein' (to song).      Melody is a variant.

She has been in trouble for identity theft (towards my husband) and even worse. Well, last night we got an 800 call. We don't answer them because for the past 6 months it has been a recording telling us that our vehicle warranty is about to expire. Anyway, this morning I was picking up our voice mail and there was a message from a mortgage company looking for my husband because he may be a relative of someone they are looking for. So, I called the number and found out it was my husband's ex wife's new husband. They said he had moved and changed phone numbers.       Well, for the past two months every time she comes over she is bragging about how they have to move into one of their rentals while they build a bigger house. Once they had finished moving, she called us and gave us her new number. I thought that was odd. Every time we have moved, we have just taken our number with us.       So, without going into much more detail, would you have given the mortgage company any info as to how to contact them?          I am asking here because my contacts and others who I value their input hang out here!!

20090220052615AA6UwqI	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	BBT charting - where do you stick the thermometer?	1.) where do you stick the thermometer? Mouth? under tongue or in the side of your cheek?    Or vaginally?       I stick it in my mouth in my left side of my cheek at 7:30 am. I've read somewhere about doing that vaginally, but that's not for me. Plus i read its more accurate in your mouth. Has anyone charted vaginally with the BBT thermometer?      2.) I started charting late this month.... will this make a difference?       I charted on CD 7 and not again until CD 11 (today). I Know I wont find a cover line now, but will I still be able to see a surge? (reason I didn't chart was basically pure laziness on reading more about it till yesterday - dumb reason I know!)      3.) my BBT has been 96.7 for CD 7 and 96.5 for today (taken on side of the cheek) is this number low? should I be doing something else?
20090220063821AAEsL0i	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	5 weeks pregnant, had sex, cramped really bad.. now bleeding?signs of misscarriage?	I havent been to a doctor yet, but i was supposed to get my period on Valentines day, which means its 6 days late. Im never this late, and im experiencing pregnancy symptoms, so i just know im pregnant. I have taken 2 HPT's and they've come out negetive, but im possitive im pregnant. I had originally planned on going to the doctors for an initial test, on this coming up Tuesday, but something happened...      Ok, so i havnt had sex since about the time i concieved on the 2nd of February, but i've had sex yesterday twice with hubby, and the 1st time it was ok at first, but after a while, i started to feel soooo bad, like a major cramp, with no bleeding. Then i felt better after about an hour or so and we did it again, but this time it didnt hurt.      I was fine up until it was time for me to lie down and go to bed. I was feeling a little crampy, as if i was actually on my period, which i heard was normal, so i didnt think that much about it. And i woke up at 530am, and i just looked at my panties (sorry tmi), and theres brownish red spots, not enough to fill a pad, or tampon, but its still there. and i was feeling crampy.      NOW its 930, and ive looked at my panties and there lots! of blood, and i dont know what to do about it. its not bright red, like period blood, but its dark, and its heavy. im normaly not evn heavy on a period.and im still crampy. is this a sign of miscarriage?   My question is, has this ever happened to anyone before? Is this normal?
20090220053659AAXVCOH	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Helping a teen get through a real rough week, Emotional and Physical Stress?	He's been going through a real rough week, and it just started getting bad on wednesday. It started when he woke up to feed his gerbil but he finds it laying dead, he's having a real hard time in school with the new math reviews and is overwhelmed with homework.He has 2 fillings at the dentist on sunday. He's been having growing pains since monday and they've been getting worse. He's almost grown a inch in the last month, from 5'2 1/2 to just about 5'3 and is 14 years old. He came home from school yesterday and had a pinched nerve in his neck from twisting it accidently in gym class when they were doing wrestling, then accidently injured his lower back and he said it was completely sore earlier today. The pinched nerve is supposed to go away in around 3 days, so right now he can't move his head right or left.He has a math test and a english test on monday, and told me he's probably going to fail the math since he's not ready.      I was with him earlier this evening and he fell asleep at around midnight. He's still there fast asleep, right behind me on the couch. I'm about to carry him off to his bed and let him sleep in. I'm going to have him stay home today from school. Definately not in the shape.      He's been completely choked since wednesday, I can really see he's been completely stressed and feels down on himself, has already let out some tears. I want to prevent anymore stress for him for this week, maybe have him go to school for next tuesday if he isn't ready for his tests.What would be the Best things I can do, to help him cope through this rough week for him and just comfort him until he's up and well again? I'm planning on helping him with his math when he feels like doing some (and yes we both suck at math)      Thanks!

We started feeding her SMA Gold but she is very restless and cries alot.  We have tried infacol and dentinox which do not seem to be making any difference.  We have also tried taking her to a chiropractor as she was delivered with forceps and was told it may help.  The health visitor told us to change from SMA to Aptamil as is easier to digest.  She doesnt seem to be any better and today has had really bad upset tummy.  So much so that her nappy leaked and she was covered .. poor little thing.  Has anyone else had any similar experiences with Aptamil?  What did you try?      I have booked her in with the doctor in an hour but thought I would get some opinions aswell.      Thanks

20090220073008AAFRaHI	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Do you expect more from your own kids?	I recently posted a question about my 12 month old sons lack of communication (he knows very few words).  I was reassured that he is within the normal range for children.  BUT- I envisioned (although ill-advised) that by 12 months he would be able to say "mama, may I have some juice?" and he is a far cry away from that!      Does anyone else expect more from their own kids?  I find myself telling everyone that it is okay that your 10 month old has no teeth, does not roll over, etc but at the same time I am secretly thanking God that my son can do all of those things, and is somehow more "advanced" than that child.  I know that it is silly!  It is okay if someone else's child does not walk by 10 months old, but my son better be!        Am I the only parent in the world that expects her child to be bigger, faster, smarter, etc?  Will this mini competition I am having in my head ever end???

20090220060319AAMURwN	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Stretch marks on my calf muscles even though i exercise?	I'm 14 and i am 5 foot 7 tall and i weigh 120 pounds. The country i originate from are home to tall, well built people, hence my height and weight, so i'm not bothered about it. Plus the rest of my family are built like this too.       I play sports often and i go on my pedal machine at my gran's house everyday for 30 minutes. It's just one of those exercise machines that you sit on and pedal your legs, like a bike. I also eat healthily and drink a lot of water.       Anyway, yesterday i was examining the calf muscle area on my legs, and i noticed two, thin, fairly small silvery white lines and my right leg. I checked my other leg and sure enough, i had another similar line, just this time there was one and it was much more shorter. When i run my fingers over them, they are slightly indented into my skin.       I think they may be stretch marks, but i'm confused. I know stretch marks are a red colour at first, and then they fade into a silver colour, but why are there only three of them and they are very small, barely noticeable? They are slightly more obvious in natural light, but you can't see them in artificial light. I've never noticed them before. Now i have two conclusions as to why i have them, if they are stretch marks:       a) A growth spurt triggered the stretch marks a while ago. I'm tall for my age, and iv'e had huge growth spurts since i was a kid till i was 13 and a half. Iv'e stopped growing now, which may be why the marks have faded. Plus, my legs have always been much longer than the upper part of my body.   b) Muscle build in my calf muscles due to exercise. Since august last year, i took up another sport which involves a lot of footwork, and i started using the pedal machine everyday in january - perhaps a lot of leg exercise has muscled up my calfs, but the skin couldn't keep up and instead stretched? When i tense my calf muscles, you can see the line of, errm, muscle, i suppose lol, underneath the skin, which i didn't have in the past.      Either way, does anyone know if they may stretch even more? And is there a way to prevent more from appearing?

I'm getting really down over this i have a dr's appt for next wednesday for a blood test but its very upsetting to play this like waiting game..

20090220045006AA7cYIv	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	Found out very late that i am pregnant, is there still time to abort?	I just found out that i am pregnant after debating the fact for a few months. i have already been pregnant once and after careful consideration aborted within the first 6 weeks using the pill method. i started taking birth control within a month after but my cycle never came back. i thought it was just me adjusting to everything that was happening to my body and gave it time to work its self out. i even asked my doctor after three months if it was normal to not have gotten my period and she said that it was just a side effect of the birth control and not to worry. after the 4th pack of pills i worried and took a test only to find out that i am in fact pregnant.      i am in no place in my life to be having a baby( too young, too poor, too unstable all the way around), nor is the father but i am worried that it is too late to have an abortion(preferably using the pill method again) without it causing serious damage to my body/health. i know this isn't going to be easy by any means but how hard is it going to be maybe the real question.... i know that this sounds selfish of me to want to abort this baby but having it really is not an option. i have not been living very healthy the past few months and certainly have not been taking precaution for a baby so who knows what damage i have already done to its growth. it is best for everyone involved to not go through with this pregnancy but is it too late?   i just recently started to gain weight and have a hard stomach. i suppose that is the pregnancy starting to show? i don't even know for sure how far along i really am which makes this even worst.      i'm very scared, very ashamed and very clueless so if anyone has any advice for me that i can use i would really appreciate it because i just don't know what to do.

20090220062236AAIk781	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Having a drink and breastfeeding?	My birthday was yesterday and my boyfriend wanted to take me to Applebee's for a drink to celebrate my birthday.  We currently have a 6 week old baby and I am breastfeeding.  I haven't had a drink in almost a year.  I pumped out milk for my MIL to feed him while we were gone and also had some for afterwards.  While I was there I had a Bud Light, and a Mucho Strawberry Daiquiri.  I read that it takes 1 hour for the beer to come out of your blood stream and an hour for every oz of liquor.  I'm guessing there's about 2 oz of liquor at most in the daiquiri so that would mean I would have to wait 3 hours after my last drink just to be safe.  I stopped drinking at 8:30pm and I came home and fed the baby pumped milk at 10:00pm.  At 2:30am, he woke for another feeding and I gave him my milk.  I know there is no 24 hour rule, I understand the concept of alcohol concentration in the bloodstream and milk and that you don't need to pump out your milk to be "safe".  Do you think it was ok to feed him at 2:30 without anything happening to his liver?

20090219223107AAysdli	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Question............(pregnant?…	I'm really curious right now, not stressed, just curious. I had unprotected sex on Febuary 10. The past two days Ive been having light cramps and mood swings, kind of like PMS symptons, but different. I took a test tonight and it was negative, but upon further investigating, only a little after a week after a possible conception would be too soon for an acurate test anyway. Then I read that egg implantation occurs a week after conception and causes PMS-type symptons....so I'm wondering if I may be pregnant. Anyone know how much longer I should wait to take another test?? Also, I don't know when my last period was, so I have no way of knowing when its due.

I thought i bought my last buggy about a year ago for my son, a quinny zapp, but unfortunately it is now broken... (in several places..) so i will need to get a new one. My son is almost 2 years old, is a good walker for short distances but he can't walk all the way to our child minder and back every day so i will need a new one for a while at least.      so does anyone have a good suggestion? he is already 15 kg and i've noticed that many push chairs are not suitable for heavier...       Since I've had a quinny zapp, i need something that is easy to maneouver and is quite small as we don't have much storage space in the flat. i don't think i could go back to something big and bulky. I would consider a quinny zapp again but i'm not sure how they are with older children? if you've got any experience that would be great.      thanks!

Two lines meaning pregnant and one line meaning not pregnant. The test yesterday had an extremely faint positive line. Almost impossible to see and my second test today had the same but a little clearer to see but still very very faint. Does this mean that it is positive but just not enough hcg in urine to make it a clearer result? Or should I consider it a negative result? Anyone have a similar test? Thanks to all who reply XX :D

20090220063212AAnGwvc	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	How to become more independent of my parents?	First, let me tell some background information. I am 16 years old turning 17 this year and desperately have been trying to become independent of my parents (specifically my mother. mother and father is divorced) I have been jumping everywhere, living with a lot of different family members and haven't lived with my mother steadily since 13. I am currently residing with my grandmother. She works almost everyday from about 1pm - 11pm, so I pretty much have the house, almost to myself. Even though my grandma supports me at the moment, I have been out looking for jobs so that I can show that I can support myself. She provided me a room of my own that she says I can live in, rent-free, although I proposed to pay her rent. The only catch is she says I have to live with her I have to go to church, two times a week and they are about 1 hr 45 Min's long. I agreed to the arrangement. But I dont think this is enough independence for me. I have been planning, once I get on my own two feet, to move elsewhere. First off, there is a local government program called Project Prepare that rents studio apartments to 16-20 yr olds. You have to have a job and go to school to get in. The rent is $100 a month (electricity and water included) But it is not guranteed because I have to apply and they do a couple interviews to see if I eligible. There is also a small waiting list (guessing about 3-4 months) And even if I do get accepted they only let you stay there from 3 to 6 months time.        Another option is my mother's friends house. She has an empty room at her house that she has been known to rent to those who need it. But the thing is I'm not really on the best of terms with her, since I'm not on good terms with my mother. If she ever did rent that room to me, it would be $400 a month, plus me splitting the water/electricity bill, plus any other living expense (ex. food, phone, entertainment) And plus my mother would have to okay with it. Plus my mother visits her at least once a week, with not more. Given all this information what can I do to become more independent?      ???
20090220063444AAultZm	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Daughter’s bikini top incident?	Firstly I would like to thank you for your comment regarding my daughter allowing her boyfriend to undo her bikini top in our pool while she thought I would be out.      I thought you would like to know that the following has happened regarding my 15 year-old daughter and the bikini top incident.      1. She is grounded for two months which means apart from school, school activities and her dance lessons/ competitions she has to be at home no friends and definitely no boyfriend are allowed to come over for the duration.      2. The 3 bikinis and 2 swimsuits have been retained but are confiscated indefinitely and are currently being kept at her grandmother’s (my Mother), she saw them being handed over, going into gran’s bag and going home with her. So my daughter knows that her bikinis and swimsuits are no longer at home and knows that the confiscation period is indefinite at this point in time.      3. I have bought her a new swimsuit the operative word being “swim” it is a T-Back  with a high front built-in-bra with soft cups, the suit is also quite high at the back the main section ends just below  the shoulder blades and it has very low cut leg-line. Colour wise it is plain navy. My daughter has worn it once and reckons it is difficult to wriggle out of it especially when it is wet.      4. My daughter is also now fully aware that if I find out that she has or wears any type of swimwear other than the above swimsuit until I give her permission to do so that these will be destroyed immediately and that those under confiscation will also be destroyed.      I did talk to her about the risks eg pregnancy etc and that I really expect better behavior from her as she really has been raised to know better.       I would like your views on this?

20090220065306AAayzfI	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Laproscopy scheduled for March 3rd.. got my bloodwork & ultrasound results back.. ughh..?	So, I went to see the specialist yesterday, to talk about my results from the internal ultrasound, and my bloodwork from day 3 and day 21 of my cycle.      Anyway, she said the bloodwork shows that I ovulated, and the hormones and everything are ok. She tried to explain it though, and said something like the count should be in the 30's or something, "16" being the minimum that's considered normal.. and mine was "19." So in other words, it's just above normal or something.      Then, the internal ultrasound I had done back in January, said that everything looks perfect according to that... size of my uterus, etc. I asked her about the cysts I used to have on my ovaries, and she said none were there!       So I really don't understand why it's been over a year of TTC, and nothing has EVER happened!!      Anyway, she did say that the ultrasound doesn't show other stuff, like whether or not my tubes might be blocked, etc. so she still wants me to have the laproscopy done. I thought it would take some time to wait for that to be scheduled, but it turns out that I go in on March 3rd!! So, sooner than I expected.       Anyway, I am still waiting for AF to start right now. It should be due today or tomorrow.. ughh.. I took a digital pregnancy test a couple days ago (even though it was days before AF) because they are supposed to be more sensitive.. anyway, turned out NEGATIVE. Well, to be more specific, it said "NOT PREGNANT." LOL..       Anyway, has anyone ever gone through any of this?

20090220074336AANpDf8	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	Does anyone have parenting advice for me?  Help!?	Love my kids, hate parenting, please send advice...      I am a professional working woman happily married to a professional working man.  We've been together nearly 10 years, and decided to adopt, rather than have biologic kids mostly for humanitarian reasons.  Better (we thought) still would be to keep siblings together who may otherwise be separated.  And that is what we did.  Two years ago we adopted a sibling pair: 3 year old boy and 6 year old year from Ukraine.  The adoption process itself was generally straightforward with the exception of 6 unbelievably painful weeks in Ukraine.  I thought it would be downhill from there, but, wow, that has not been the case.      The kids are truly great, loving, healthy and bonded.  They will not, however, play alone - ever.  They constantly follow us around doing the annoying things kids do like ask incessant questions, fight with each other, etc.  I feel like 99% of my interaction with my kids (and my husband's too) are redirecting behavior, imposing consequences for bad choices, trying to explain why they should or should not do something, cleaning recurring messes.  I absolutely HATE it.      I never thought parenting would be easy, inexpensive or carefree time-wise.  I did, however, think there would be SOMETHING, ANYTHING about it that I would enjoy.  And, I don't.  I have been depressed, sought counseling, been medicated, had grandparent and friend help, done yoga, gone to adoption support groups, called the parent helpline, God knows - EVERYTHING I can think of to try to move into a better mental space.  Right now I just feel like I am a total b#$%h all the time, making me hate myself, my kids, and my life.  This feeling has been virtually unchanged for 2 years and I am having fantasies of finding them a new home.  If anyone has any ideas for me, I would be so very grateful.  Thank you.

20090220075718AA6lUvN	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	What exactly is implantation bleeding?	Ok so. My period is late. It'll be about 6 days today. I am pretty regular so this it abnormal. My boyfriend and I don't use birth control. He pulls out. I know the risks involved and etc. I was due for my period February 14th. It is now the 20th. I have taken two pregnancy tests (the 16th and the 18th) both were negative. I had light spotting start on the 18th. It usually ends by 11. (I get up with my daughter at 9 am) I only wear a pantie liner because it never is heavy. My period is usually very heavy and I never spot bleed before. I've experience cramps and things, but not like normal period cramps. My question is, what exactly is implantation bleeding? I've googled and read all kinds of articles but none of them answer my question. I'm going crazy here! I have the birth control pills to start and I don't even have my period yet! I'd be happy if I was pregnant or not. I just need an answer!!

I have 3 kids and this is my 4th pregnancy. I can't get the thought out of my head "Twins?"... I don't know if it's wishful thinking or if it's "intuition".  But basically, I am just retaining way too much water in my feet, ankles, hands, and face and I am only 7 weeks pregnant. I have severe exhaustion and I feel hungry a lot more than I did with previous pregnancies. Also, I've already gained about 8 pounds in 2 weeks.  I have nausea that wakes me up from my sleep at night... Could it be twins... did any of you have those symptoms when you suspected it was twins?  I can't wait for my u/s which is a week from now. I will keep you guys updated but I appreciate any input from moms of twins... thank you.

20090220064133AAMqwbM	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Parents, am I overreacting or would you be concerned?  How would you handle this?	My four year old son goes to a preschool.  The children bring their own snack everyday; usually just a small snack and drink.     Yesterday Caiden (my son) came home with his lunchbox, and instead of it being empty as usual, it had some crackers in it that I know didn't come from our house.  I asked him where they came form and he said his friend gave them to him.   It bothers me that the children can so freely share their food.  As a person who is certified to handle and serve food myself, I know that it is not sanitary for the children to share their snacks.  I am usually not really overprotective and weird about germs and such, but this has me concerned.    Does it seem to you that more care should be put into making sure th children are not sharing snacks or am I overreacting?  What would you do about it?
20090220045056AAi2qJ4	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	For Parents of asthmatic children.....?	I asked a Q a few days ago regarding my son when he comes home from his Grandmother's house.       http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...       We now believe that he is definately allergic to something in her house, whether its a combination or all her animals at once compared to our ONE animal. The last 2 times he cae home from there, he started breathing really funny (heavy, hard & fast) and we are starting to think it's an asthma. Although he can sleep through breathing like this, it scares the crap out of me.       My Q is:      When your child is having an attack, what are their symptoms? Do they ever get physically ill (runny nose/cough) from being around the allergy?      I'm new to this whole asthma thing so I'd appreciate any advice.      BTW: I'm making an appointment for him with an allergist/asthma doctor.

Me and her are working threw that along with allot of helpful advice I got on here and our pediatrician. I have 4 other kids all school age. My mother who was only 54 just passed away Feb. 1st due to small cell lung cancer and died a very painful horrible death. I have a horrible x husband who causes problems to put it mildly. The thing is I am exhausted. I was helping take care of my mother who became bed ridden and it wore me down. I have a wonderful husband, but he tunes me out most of the time. He does not listen very well. Like this past week end he dumped his brother's kids on me with out asking and he went to work. It was awful. The kids ran amuck while my poor new born screamed for hours while I walked with her. By the time he got home I was in tears. I feel like my exhaustion is adding to my depression and I do not know what to do. I am afraid to call my doctor because I do not want to be put on anything. Any advice on how to work through all thia with out losing my mind or crying ALL the time? Thanks for bothering to read all this whining and answering.

20090220060101AAcrJid	Pregnancy & Parenting;Grade-Schooler	Is speech therapy taking away personality?	I have 3 boys who were all late speakers....none of them really got going until 3 (although they all missed out the baby talk stage and just went from babble to real words :P) and although offered, I refused speech therapy for them and they all talk me to distraction now.   My middle boy has a very VERY slight lisp, nothing you would really pick up on if you met him in the street, as I say, slight lisp.   Anyway, yesterday my son had a session with the school nurse (P1 check , height weight etc) and she picked up on this lisp and asked if we had considered speech therapy.   My question is this, Speech therapy seems to be handed out to any child with even the mildest impediment (and I hesitate to use the word impediment ), are we training the diversity of our speech out of children?? A tiny lisp that doesn't effect a child's talking and is perfectly understandable shouldn't be held up as an impediment.   Speech therapy should surely be saved for kids that NEED it to be understood.   What are your thoughts??

20090220063701AADR7dC	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Constipation problems in 8 month old...?	our son is almost 8 months old and lately we have been having to give him prunes about 1x every 2-3 weeks or so b/c he gets constipated and starts crying and screaming when he is trying to go poop.  When he poops its always really compacted and firm looking.  I hate having to give him prunes that often to get him cleaned out.  With the prunes its really soft, almost like melted chocolate that has been cooling for a little while and he goes like 5-6 times a day for 2 days or so...      So last night I got some baby prune/apple juice to try that.  Normally with a juice for him (maybe 1x per week) I mix like 2 oz juice with 2-3 ounces of water.  With the prune juice, should I back the juice itself back to about 1 oz and add in the rest (3-4 ounces) as water?  I want him to stay cleaned out and keep from getting constipated, but I don't want it to cause everything (food and formula) to just run straight through him b/c then he won't be getting much from any of it...      Does 1 oz prune/apple juice with 3-4 ounces of water sound like it would keep him regular without making him go 1/2 dozen times a day??

20090220062732AAESwcX	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Do barbies, bratz, hanna montana ruin girls' body image?	QueenBee the troll posted this question:  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...  and it got me thinking.      How do you feel about letting your child play with toys like barbie, bratz, and hanna montana?      Hannah Montana: I don't really know much about but I did a Google image search  http://images.google.com/images?hl=en&cl...  and she seems to be a normal shape and size for a teenage girl and doesn't even dress slutty. So I don't see how that would ruin a girls body image... I have heard that she has a bad attitude on the show though, I don't know about that. I've never watched and my daughter is too young.      Bratz - I really really don't like. They encourage girls to be bratty, they're not even close to actual human proportions, they wear massive amounts of makeup, and the ones I've seen in the store have some pretty slutty outfits.      Barbie - My favorite childhood toy! I can't wait til my daughter is old enough for barbies. I played with them all through childhood and as far as I can tell they didn't do any psychological harm to me. Ok, yes barbie is thin and still slightly out of proportion. However, unless you have a medical condition there is really no reason to be fat. Especially as a child. Its the parent's fault for not feeding them properly and encouraging exercise. So while kids should be taught to accept overweight people and not judge them, they should also be taught that it is best to be at a healthy weight, fat enough to cover your bones (not like these anorexic actresses!) but not with extra flab all over. I would LOVE to see a line of dolls made with human proportions at what is considered a healthy weight. Anyway, my barbies came in all different colors and I had different outfits for different careers and I feel like they were a way for me and my friends as children to roleplay situations we saw in real life and deal with them. I think much more good than harm comes from them.      What are your thoughts on these and other toys? Does/will your daughter/son play with them?
20090220064602AAG4Df8	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	When should I have another baby?	So this is the deal my husband and I have a beautiful 2 1/2 year old baby girl or big girl as she likes to call herself :). This is the situation my husband already has two boys from a previous relationship oldest will be 7 this year and the other 4. Now I have taken them under my wing and love them very much but I want another for me I know we have "3 kids" but I will always have  had only one child. I have asked my husband for another but he really doesn't want one. I have been a house wife for awhile raising our daughter and helping with his boys when he was deployed but lately I want another. (Im going back to school soon) Well The other day he said once I get my finish with school  and work for like a year we can have another and that excited me but.... That is like 3 to 4 years from now our youngest will be 6 almost 7 by then I don't think I would want another. All the kids will be in school. So should I have one now? Or do think after that long I will want another. I was also thinking that is a big gap between the kids. There is a big gap between my younger brother and sister and me. I feel my mom raised me way more harsh than she is with them now. So what im saying is if I wait that long I don't want that to be the slacker kid the one we don't discipline as hard... I don't know advice please!

I am just saying this b/c I feel like whenever someone brings up abortion that people get all riled up. Both sides. As pregnant women we don't need to be getting upset over what someone posted and I think a lot of times we feel strongly either way either for or against. So I just think maybe we should just direct people to either the political section or womens health section so we don't have to get all upset.

20090220054529AAFwcKD	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Own company pregnancy tests: Superdrug Vs Boots?	Which is more reliable? (According to your own experiences!)      Superdrug x1 test - ￡3.99   Boots x1 test - ￡3.91      ** ADDITIONAL DETAILS **      Last saturday (14th) I took a test, which I purchased from superdrug. It came out positive, although faint. The sign for positive was - and nothing appeared for negative.   If I am/was pregnant, at this time I would've been 4 weeks pregnant, when suggested to take a test. It was done roughly mid-morning, and I hadn't eaten or drunk anything.      Today, before going to work, I bought a Boots one. I had eaten, but I had bought it in a bad state, as I was beginning to disbelieve myself because I think or thought, everything bad happened to me (although I had a lot of symptoms including spotting, nausea, discharge). I took it, only to reveal it was negative, and of course this wound me up into a worse state.    Now I'm completely stuck.   I felt like dropping in this ultrasound centre in my town after work, but then managed to calm myself down during the day.       I have got an appointment for thursday, so I can ask my doctor about this, and she can test me, but I'm still really worried!    I really sure hope my 6 weeks of caring for myself very well, isn't all that wasteful!       And one last question that I want to throw in -       ** Even if you're only about say... 1 week pregnant, can a blood test, or anything like blood pressure detect the pregnancy? **

20090220051148AAMo1i9	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Why would my doctor want to do a transvaginal u/s at 12 weeks?!?	I asked a question yesterday wondering if the picture from a transvaginal ultrasound would look the same as the ones from an abdominal one and I found out that yea they do but alot of people wondered WHY they would do a transvaginal one at 12 weeks...       Well this got me wondering myself and quite frankly, I really am not thrilled about getting an ultrasound this way.       I want to know you opinions on WHY my doctor would even want to do a transvaginal ultrasound on me at 12 weeks.. I thought they only did those very early in pregnancy?! I didn't get to ask my doctor why she wanted to do it this way because she didn't mention to me that it would be a vaginal ultrasound until she was walking me to the front to pay and I didn't want to just start asking questions while we were standing in the middle of the hallway. Has ANYONE else ever had to get a vaginal ultrasound at week 12? Why does she want this!?

20090220060323AACiQ7W	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Baby wants to nurse more often?	My baby girl will be 4 months next week.  Since day one she wanted to nurse every 3 hours, 10 minutes, one side.  For over a month and a half now she has been sleeping 9 hours at night, without nursing (waking at 6-630am).  Over the last week and a half she is waking up earlier and earlier.  It started at 6am, 530am, 500am, and this morning it was 4am.  She nurses and goes right back to sleep.  Also throughout the day she has started nursing longer-but not a concentrated, I'm hungry type, more of a playful suck, pull away,smile, suck type.  I was always told that the older they got they would nurse farther apart and for shorter periods.  Does this sound normal?

I have babysat for a family 3 times now and they have an 8 year old boy. Last weekend I went down to their tv room to see what he was up to, and I found him sitting on the floor with his pants and underwear off, and the family dog between his legs. He was letting the dog lick his dink. He was actually erect.      I wasn't sure what to do! I probably made a mistake but I just went back upstairs. I guess I should have went in and stopped him, but I didn't know what to say.      Should I have gone in and stopped him? I guess I should tell his mom, but not sure how to.      Why would this boy be doing that?
20090220061751AA2HeN6	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Is this in poor taste?	I returned to work at a middle/high school from maternity leave this week, and I pump 2 - 3 times daily. In order to insure that no one with a master key walks into my office while I'm pumping, I put a sign on the door, and close the blinds. When I had my first son two years ago, my sign had a picture of my son, and a note underneath saying, "I'm preparing Bernard's lunch. Please do not disturb". Everyone one loved it. This time around for my 2nd son, my sign has a picture of someone milking a cow, and says, "I'm busy. Do not disturb." Most people in my building have thought it was funny, but someone said it was in bad taste. I didn't want to do the same thing as I had with my first son, because students would see the sign, and keep knocking at the door wanting to come in because they thought I had my baby in the office with me and wanted to see him. This time I've not had that problem because they just think I'm busy and don't get the picture of the cow being milked at all.      Do you all think I should change my do not disturb sign, and if so, what do you think it should be?

I had never heard of this until I joined YA, but I've read several  questions / answers about using breast milk in cooking for your child.      Are you supposed to use breast milk in substitute of milk when cooking for you child? I'd never heard of this.      What about when you are making food for you and your husband, using regular milk, but you want to give your baby some to see if he/she likes it. Are you still supposed to have used breast milk? Because I certainly know neither my husband nor myself want to be drinking my breast milk!      I'm not trying to be naive, I'd just never heard of this and wanted some clarification.

20090220051122AA862VA	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Urine infections during pregnancy.?	I'm 24 weeks pregnant. During the past couple of months I have had a reoccurring infection detected in my urine. It has been treated twice now with antibiotics, once at 9-10 weeks pregnant and again at 23 weeks. however i had no symptoms of a urine infection except slight back pain just below my rib cage and a few pains in my bladder which I had been passing off as normal during pregnancy. I went back to my doctor after the course of antibiotics to check the infection had gone, but his words were..'there still seems to be a problem'..and he asked the nurse to take a swab to see if anything came up from that. My results came back that the swab showed no infection of any sort however my urine sample still had 'red blood cells' in apparently. I'm so, so confused as I'm really not quite sure what is going on or what these results might mean. The doctor asked me if I had any bleeding in between periods, which I don't- which then made me think he may want to do a smear test? (i'm 19 and have never had one). However he didn'tmention this. I'm extremely worried and confused and the doctor doesnt even know what seems to be going on so I have no reassurance. Has anyone else had the same problem or does someone maybe have any suggestions as to whats going on with me? Please note I HAVE been to my doctor I'm just using yahoo answers because i'm completely confused and distressed.

Well we breastfed him until Wednesday and found that it didn't work out for us because my wife has a lot of health problems. Well anyway, we brought him home yesterday and he will eat an ounce and a half of formula and then an hour and a half later he's ready to eat another bottle. Well after every feeding he spits up several times. How much are babies supposed to eat and spit up? I feel like we are feeding him to much and am just so unsure.  The nurses at the hospital said he should eat 1 to 2 ounces every 4 hours and he just isn't following that at all.  Should I be concerned?

20090220053421AAqoke4	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Why does one breast produce so much more milk when pumping?	Hello! I have a weird problem: I exclusively BF my 1 y.o. DD, but pump when I'm at work. For some reason, my left breast only produces about HALF the amount that the right one does when pumping.      I usually pump every 2-4 hours, and when I do, I get about 3oz. from the right and only 1.5oz. from the left. I have tried various sizes of breastshields, as well as the inserts that go inside of them. I have also tried placing the shield in different areas, to not constantly put pressure on the same area.      My DD nurses throughout the night, so I know I'm making enough. I just seem to have a problem getting it OUT.      Does anyone have any ideas/suggestions?      Thank you SO much! :)

I have tried everything.  Well last month, we said we were giving up (I know that's a bad attitude) but we thought if we took it easy, it may happen.     About 7 months ago, my cycles changed alittle.  I went from having a VERY regular, 28 day cycle to not really knowing when it was coming.  I have never had a cycle that lasted more then 28 days.  They range from 21 days to 28 days.  With the average being about 24-25 days.  Well, it's day 29 and no period.  I have been feeling alittle sick to my stomach and had alittle heartburn.  But we all have been there were we feel these early signs and our periods come.   I am not directly looking for an answer here.  I simply wanted to vent.  I have not purchased a preg test yet.  Part of me thinks my period is right around the corner.  With my cycle history do you think I shoudl wait alittle longer or could I test?   Please wish me luck!!   Thanks to everyone for listening and I hope this month brings tons of baby news!!

20090220062446AARtnFu	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	What would you do?  Newborn?	The other night I decided that it was best me my new son and I to move in temp. with my mom which is only 10 minutes away. He has a bad case of colic and does not give up. He cries all day and night and sleeps half ***. And I to the point of giving up. No sleep, getting really bad mood swings with everyone. especially my husband. So I thought it would be best because my mom is wonderful and will help me out all she can with my son.    My husband and I are happy and all, but it is just no help when it comes this the baby. Our son is over a mth old and he hasn't even changed a diaper. And when I asked him for his help, he said to just put him in his crib and let him cry it out. Well I can't to that. My heart won't let me. My husband loves hanging out in his shop till the wee hours of the night. So I have NO help with him.      So I know being here will help my son and I adjust and hopefully get through this stage without going insane.       Yea, My husband does disagree with the discussion I have made, but to keep our marriage happy and my sanity good. I had to do this.      So do you think I have done the right thing?

On my notes she wrote 5-6 weeks gestation. Do you think this is a sign its not growing properly? Haven't got another scan or anything untill 12 weeks. Not experiencing any pain or cramps anymore feel a bit nauseous and v v thirsty. Any ideas?   Thanks for reading   love   Cxxx

20090220065919AA1g6ph	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Just a query??? What do you think about this?	So before my boyfriend was with me, he was in a relationship with another girl for about 4 years. From the age 15-19.    Now before ages ago before I got pregnant, he told me how he was worried he couldn't have kid as they always had unprotected sex and she never got pregnant. He even went to the doctors to be given a sperm pot so it could be checked but never got round to sending it of and then I got pregnant anyway.   Now I have always been on some kind of birth control since 15, turnt 20 this month. However just before I got pregnant I didn't like a new Birth Control I was on and was waiting for my period to come so could start a different one.   Now I never thought he couldn't have kids like he thought but as she had managed to get away with not getting pregnant for 4 years I kinda thought il be fine although we were using condoms sometimes.   Anyway within about 2 weeks of coming of that pill, my period never come and found out I was pregnant at 6 weeks.   Now I am so glad that I got pregnant now, as I love my little Girl so much already!!   But why do you think he couldn't get her pregnant for 3/4 yeras and he got mr pregnant within two weeks with out Birth Control???   Its not a Big Deal I know but just a thought.   Been with him since he was 20 and he 22 next week.   xxx

20090220071359AATMcFz	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	My 5 year old hears voices?? an update?	Yesterday I posted this about my daughter:When my daughter was 2 she would talk to her hands, and make them hit each other for not doing what they were suppose to do. This was strange since we don't hit her. There is no violence in my family at all. Over the past few years she has talked to people who weren't there. When asked who she's talking to she says "no one" A few months ago she started saying "God damn it" which we don't say... so I asked her "where did you hear that??" and she said "Shadow man said it" UGH sooo creepy. She also talked to Shadow man at my brothers house while she was staying the night with her cousin. And now, she's hitting her head saying "the people in my head won't stop talking I can't think" I wouldn't be so concerned if this were the first time she'd done something weird. But it's not. This has been going on and off since she was two. Not the voices but.. the oddness. I'm going to talk to her psychiatrist about it, but I just want to get other opinions. I feel like I've done something wrong as a parent. I'm hoping it's all been for attention, maybe I don't pay enough attention to her! Her teacher had to call me on the phone today telling me she was doing the head hitting and talking about the voices in class.. I feel so embarrassed and sad for her because all those kids were staring at her. Some websites say this is normal, for kids to hear voices. They grow out of it. But what about the people she sees and talks to? Could this be a game she plays with herself? She wasn't very socialized with other kids til she started school this year. Now I'm thinking that was a horrible mistake.       Now when she got home I asked her what happen, and she said with an angry face "That didn't happen!" I pressed on... She eventually said her work was too hard. But I talked to her teacher and told her what she said and her teacher says "It didn't seem like she was making it up, she was covering her ears screaming the people in my head won't be quiet and I can't think" she said that my daughter seems scared and really really frustrated. I asked if the other kids were mean about it and she said "OH no they kept telling her it will be ok , it's ok" So I'm relieved about that. Her Dr. said they want to give her an EEG and make sure she's not having seizures. They also said something about admitting her! I said NO WAY. she's not harmful to herself or anyone around her. I couldn't get my daughter to tell me what they were saying or who they were, she just kept denying that she heard anything. Her teacher says it didn't look like a seizure and she was "in her own world, in her own zone" after talking with her teacher I"m even more concerned about it. Why would she deny it now?? I told her she's not in trouble but mommy needs to know what's going on so I can fix it. I had to bribe her with quarters for her piggy bank for her to just tell me her school work was too hard. Her assignment was to draw a picture or write about whatever she wanted to. Should I be worried yet? I don't know if it was real or not. I can't get a straight answer from her

But that is not it. We are really good friends and we are close. I haven't said anything to her about the name and I'm not going to. I am not one of them mother-in-laws that tells them what to do.She calls me all the time for advice and I do what I can for them. So I have closed the question so let it rest. Thank you all for your help....
20090220072335AADz3oD	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Do you,as a parent or teen,think it's wrong to have friends that are 18+?	I'm 16 and my friends ages range from 15-19. Guys and girls. Nothing is sexual, we're just friends,no lie. We're friends because we have alot in common with each other. We go to movies,hang out at the mall and stuff together,that's it. Is that so wrong?

20090220071915AA3lZzl	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	TTC and having symptoms...?	My husband and I are ttc.  I was due to ovulate around the 7th, though by doing the mucus test I think I ovulated earlier then that around the 4th, along with having some pain on the right side.  Then on the 8th I had minor spotting, not really even spotting as it was like very faint pink/red tinge. My husband says I now have "hound nose" where I smell things he can't and really no one else I ask can.  This week my breasts have been tender and nipples have been sensitive and hard a lot.  I'm due to start my period this weekend and I've already taken a test which came out negative.  Could I be pregnant?
20090220071902AAoTzNF	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Cat Trouble around children.  What should I do with a vicious cat that breaks my heart to get rid of?	I own 2 cats and an 8 month old baby. One cat is great, a little temperamental, but because the other is a ******! She has always been a bit on the crazy side. I have had both cats for 2 years now. Gradually, the mean cat has seemed to have gotten worse. She is pretty good with the baby except for when the baby pulls her fur or something but otherwise the baby shoves her face right in the cats belly, and I can usually see her getting mad and just move the baby away. Occassionally the cat will seem frisky (as most 2 year old cats can get) and will cuff at the baby but has never scratched her. But overall the cat is GREAT with the baby and is my cuddle companion at night. Although she has had a temper with me before and just scratched me out of friskiness. But never like attack.       The problem: My little brother who is 8 likes to visit my house for the weekend or whenever. Since I have had this cat she has gradually gotten worse with him and with my other cat. The 2 cats fight ficiously and do not get along EVER. She used to let me litle bro pat her and play but started to scratch him on occassion. Then she would never play nice and always would scratch. So we just had him avoid her. But now she is lunging and chasing him. He literally was running around the table crying out in fear. So I seperated them and was trying to hold her just now (2 hours after she tried going after my bro) and she just lunged at me. Now I can NOt have her doing this. Cat attacked are very serious and scary. I Love this cat though. Like I said she is my cuddle companion at night and I will miss her dearly but the only option I see is to let her outdoors 24/7 except at night to sleep or bad weather days or having animal control take her to the pound. I am torn. Please HELP! I love the cat but dont want my poor terrified brother to be afraid to visit. And I need to trust this ****** around my baby and my future children. What should I do?
20090220071200AAHFvK0	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	I need a little advice? What is this?	I'm having the weirdest month. I had unprotected sex on the 31st of jan. my period was due on the 6-8th of feb. Usually i have a 5-6 day period. I had a two day one. and i wouldn't even qualify that as a period. And then i've been feeling sick, dizzy, headaches, back aches, nausea, no vomiting though. and bloating and extremely moody and eating so much. and my breasts yesterday were aching really badly. and so i took a pregnancy test this morning. I got a negative. So am i pregnant? or is it a dud test? And also i don't know but i've had  a sore lower stomach. and i have a blue underline under my breasts. this isn't normal?
