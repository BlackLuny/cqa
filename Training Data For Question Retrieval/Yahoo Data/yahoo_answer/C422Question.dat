20070414140338AA0i6ge	Home & Garden;Other - Home & Garden	What can we do when we don't know for sure if we want to get rid of something?	We are moving, and have two couches, which we think we probably do not have room for in the new house, but it is hard to judge space right now.  It is possible we may want one of our couches, but most likely we will want to get rid of both of them and start fresh, because couches are not necessary, our new house is small, and we have a lot of furniture and other things competing for space.  Please let me know if you have any questions about my questions and situation, and I'll try to get back to you as soon as possible.

Hi      I have been reading about an average building cost of about ￡90-￡95 per SQ ft.      We have a 2 bed end terrace with large garden to the side, and are thinking of getting plans to extend.      The plan would be to add a toilet/utility area off the kitchen plus a small office/play room off the living area. Upstairs an extra bedroom would be added plus a generous en-suit to the existing master bedroom (at the back of the existing family bathroom).      We would say 5 additional windows and the footprint would be an extra 133 sq ft (around 9.5ft x 14ft).      I have rang builders but they of course want to see the property and I really just need a ball park, give or take 10% each way, as we would source windows ourselves to lower costs.      We are in Essex.      Thanks for taking the time who ever answers.
20090305060317AAKlDAv	Home & Garden;Garden & Landscape	Growing fruit on a fence?  Will it look way too tacky?	I live in an area where we have really large yards.  My neighbors have really not so nice dogs who are very large to boot.  I need a fence but since a traditional chain link is very expensive and pine fencing will not last really long and is still 2 grand itself and has upkeep.  I was thinking of doing fencing with the stuff a lot of farmers use - it is 5 foot high, says utility welded on the package.  It is galvanized and is just wire going both ways.  I thought if I bought nice round posts which I painted white and then grew vines up or bushing plants in front it would still look decent and I can just remove it someday when we sell.  I priced it and it was just about 2,700 less than chain link and since my neighbors fenced part of theirs in with something similar I do not see how anyone would be upset whereas if I put a privacy fence in people will get angry.  Basically I do not want their dogs even seeing my kids when we are outside.  They bark constantly, get very little attention and since our house is the only house they can see into the windows of and their huge run faces my kids play area they often jump the fence (4 foot high) and come over.  I thought if I had all sorts of plants and prickly plants as well they might leave us alone.  I have realized you can't just move every time to escape neighbors.
20090227040659AApDA5l	Home & Garden;Other - Home & Garden	Quick growing pot planted climber?	I have just moved to a new house which I love, only problem is there is a small balcony on the first floor which used to have a climber of some kind growing from a pot and over the balcony. The previous owner stripped this away leaving an unsightly large dark patch where the climber used to be. I'd like to cover this over with a new climber. The climber must grow from a pot because I'm talking about a balcony on the first floor (i.e second floor if you're American), and I'd like it to grow as quick as possible. I'm having a couple of gatherings here over the summer and would like to have the climber growing well by then. Its a very large house, 3 stories, detached, 5 bedrooms - so I'm not worried about being swamped. I quite like houses that are covered in climbers actually!

A while ago, our bathtub drain was severely clogged and no product like Drano would work, so we called maintenance.  The guy came and used a white powder-like product that he poured a bit into the drain and turned the water on.

Now, we haven't had any more trouble with the tub, but my boyfriend shaved his beard off in the sink and our bathroom sink is now VERY clogged. I don't want to call maintenance again because we have pet rats (we're not allowed to have any pets) and it's difficult to hide them as we have NO storage space.

Just when I find laundry products that work from either of them, they change them and they no longer work.      CHEER-  Before they had a Color Guard formula in the liquid.  It kept all of my dark and colored clothes nice.  Now, they have switched to Bright Clean for both white and colored.  It doesn't work on whites and fades colors terribly. They have a liquid just for dark clothes but it still fades darks and clothes don't smell clean.      TIDE- I have always used the powder w/ Bleach Alternative for my whites.  It sees they now only have Tide Total Care and I can't breathe the scents are so strong and it leaves orange spots all over my white  clothes.      YES, I am very picky about my laundry, but why do they change this stuff they have that works so well?   I can't find a customer service on line contact or a phone number for either company on their web sites.      What do you use to keep your dark (black navy brown) 100% cottons clean and w/ min. fading?       Same with white cotton bath towels?  Tried Cheer Bright Clean for whites and it didn't even get out a water based make up spot.  With their powder w/ bleach alternative, I NEVER had that problem.

20090305092455AAtcKCP	Home & Garden;Maintenance & Repairs	How do I make my window screens more safe?	I currently rent a house, and the landlord is fairly cheap. The screens on all the windows pop out if you even sneeze near them, in other words: they're incredibly flimsy and unsafe. My main concern is with spring coming up, I'll want to leave the windows open and I have a cat that loves to sit on window sills. I'm terrified of opening a window here because I just know my little cat will want to look out and will go for a tumble! Also, I'm about to bring in a newborn into this house, and I don't want to have to worry over time that he'll be big enough to get hurt too.      Any advice as to how to secure these screens? I can't necessarily afford to replace them, but perhaps there's a better option out there... help please!

20090305100528AAgtoUb	Home & Garden;Maintenance & Repairs	What's the best horsepower/size wet dry vacuum I should use to replace sand in my huge sand pool filter?	Sand Filter is an above ground Hayward tank if not biggest, next size down.  Was filtering a pool w/ about 3,500 gallons in it.  Was filled in to 48" all, so depth is about 2,500 (ish) now, and has bottom drains installed.  I keep getting sand on the steps of pool when I vacuum pool, and think I may have a broken lateral.  Don't have a wet dry vac now, but am considering purchasing one, being a pool/home owner and all.  Know nothing about them except they may be the easiest method to remove existing sand from filter.  I DO WANT TO SAVE THE SAND, THOUGH?  Possible with vacuum method?

They where half alive and looked horrible so I removed them after reading that a plant will kill itself trying to keep every dying piece of it alive.  My once beautiful gardenia is now completly naked. Its still alive but after over a month i have not seen any visible signs of growth (ie...tiny leaves or new branches)  Will the leaves grow back on the existing branches or only on the new ones? is it ok to cut branches assuming they will regrow?   Thanks for any help :)
