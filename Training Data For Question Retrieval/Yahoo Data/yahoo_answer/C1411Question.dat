20090309232822AAeNSS4	Social Science;Psychology	How To Get Motivated When You Dont Know What Motivates You?	I am currently at a stand still in my life. I just turned 24 not to long ago, and for some odd reason a little bit after my birthday I have lost all interest in women other then sexually, and the idea of ever getting married or having children is something at this present time I do not want. I was doing awesome at school, but also around the same time after losing interest in dating, I lost interest in school. Due to me having really good grades, I was told by the dean of my school that I can use this years tuition towards the next semester, which was very nice of them. I also have gained some weight, which is really bothering me a lot since I always like to lift weights, and eat healthy. Lately I cant seem to get myself into a positive frame of mind to stick with anything. Like I'll have short bursts of motivation, but its not consistant. How do I snap into gear when I cant figure out whats important to me at the present time? I am going through a really strange phase. Like I have a huge "dont care" attitude, which is weird because its the first time in my life I've ever been like this. Does anyone know any helpful tips to figuring out how to re-center one self, and to get back to being an aggressive person?       PS I'm not gay just to clerify. I'm still Sexually very interested in women, I just have no desire to be with them in any other way. I still respect women, but right now I cant think of anything past the sexual aspect of being with them.
20090309232730AAhR7WC	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Is this really true about men?	 http://www.jackinworld.com/library/surve...    It says the average age of the men in the survey are 22.9 years old.      It is a sexual survey.  In one of the questions it says that almost half the men are seemingly more aroused by the male body.    It also says "Even among readers who are more aroused by the female body than the male body, male genitals are frequently a source of arousal; about one-quarter of these readers find male genitals more arousing than female genitals."
20090309233802AAZVGAa	Social Science;Psychology	How do you cope with the loss of a beloved child?	my friend, hannah, has two sons. their names are luke and tyler. they are two years apart. luke is perfectly normal but tyler was born with a rare genetic disorder called prader-willi syndrome. that condition involves mental retardation, learning difficulties, stubborness, temper tantrums and behaviour problems. he is obese because the part of the brain which tells you whether you are hungry or full does not work, so he is always hungry. tyler could eat himself to death if they allow him to. the fridge must be locked at all times. hannah works as a midwife at a private hospital. their father, sam, is a chiropractor. luke is very mature for his age. he is an extremely loving and responsible big brother. he picks up tyler after school each day and looks after him until their parents get home. nobody in the neighbourhood had ever seen a closer pair of brothers. oneday the unthinkable happened. luke murdered tyler! everybody was shocked. luke will be facing charges. on that afternoon, luke was already in a very bad mood after having an argument with his best friend. at home, tyler was screaming and having a huge fit. luke got frustrated and whacked his little brother on the head with his baseball bat. tyler fell unconscious and was rushed to the hospital, where he died. the whole family is confused and upset. what sort of support can i offer them? how should they deal with it?
20090309233906AASMHjM	Social Science;Psychology	I feel as though Im not living my life on my terms.?	I'm currently in grad school at the University of Phoenix in the MBA program. I don't like the program and I don't feel inspired. Everytime I go to school I feel absolutely miserable. Everytime I speak with friends and family they tell me to stick it out. Little do they know that I haven't been writing my own papers, instead I have been getting them off the internet. I'm not proud of it and I feel like I'm cheating myself. My overall gpa is 3.11, but has been steady on the decline. What should I do? I'm already 7 classes deep. Should I quit? Stick it out? Only intelligent answers only please. No dumb one liners.
20090225091725AAxwdIS	Social Science;Psychology	Where is a guy supposed to vent?	I like how when a girl gets on here and whines about her bf dumping her and all she gets sympathy, yet when a guy does it if he dares, all he gets is shot down and told to go to a club or something and hook up. Where the f*** is a guy supposed to vent his emotions without getting judged or criticized? Or are we not supposed to have any? Seriously, WHERE IS A GUY SUPPOSED TO TURN? We're weak if we go to a counselor, we're weak if we talk to friends about it, people assume "oh, he just wants attention, how sad" is there anybody who cares anymore or is bottling it up the new "guy thing to do"? No wonder suicide is 4 times higher in guys.

20090225091926AAfw6IJ	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	How often do most women ask men out on a date in relationship or just dating?	Rarely in my opinion. So the saying " who ever ask pays " is twisted because women rarely ask, they usually wait for the man to ask.       So when people say " who ever ask pays" they really mean men usually have to pay and it should be like that. If women dont have money to take there man out they shouldnt be in a relationship and that goes  for men to

Lets face it women say this then after they CHOOSE to have the baby they come back to the man and MAKE IT his choice.      Im not saying men shouldnt be responsible for their children but because they are  laws like safe haven, roe vs wade, and etc to give women options to get out of parenthood aka have a choice. Men should have ways to have choices like women. If not women shouldnt have choices at all like men....PERIOD            What do yall think ?

20090225065404AAvdoUe	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	What do you think of this pregnancy test?	 http://www.tellmepinkorblue.com/       They claim that it can tell you what gender your baby is going to be.  According to Marie Claire magazine, they don't sell it in certain parts of Asia, because of the tendency of women in those countries to abort baby girls.      I think that this is sick.  If you want to know what gender you're having, why not just wait and get a sonogram?  What, if the baby isn't the sex you want, you'll abort it?  I don't know if I want kids or not, but if I do, I'd like to have a daughter, but if my sonogram says that I'm having a boy, I'd still be happy.  This 'test' should be abolished.

20090225084947AAsYlSe	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	Bizarro Love Triangle Dream?	I dreamed last night that I went to another dimension with my last love (he broke my heart) and new crush. We had to battle through this bizarre world against all kinds of warped things, like beanstalks (lol) and mine carts. All the while being chased by the grim reaper and my Heathcliff (apparently I was Cathy, but I had left this world to go above). At one point in the dream, Heathcliff sacrifices himself to save me and he gets sucked into the ground. I tearfully run over to him and madly try to dig him up, but my former love and new crush pull me away just when I see his face.      Then later, the grim reaper is chasing us through this ancient scary house, and about to kill us, when Heathcliff as a zombie appears. Smearing his blood on the walls, claiming that the grim reaper cannot pass by his blood because he (Heathcliff) loved me so purely in life. His actions then destroy the grim reaper. We are then allowed to return back to our dimension, but I choose to stay with Heathcliff, who is now human again.

I do not wear make-up and am not a chav. I enjoy sports and i generally want to do well. I am in set 1 for everything. And my friends know me as the smart, funny one.      Well...i have to confess. Nobody knows about this...      years ago i used to go on runescape (an adventure game by jagex) and i started giving out my msn on there.      Over time i started meeting lots of guys from runescape and i really felt that i was turning into someone else. Then it began, the guys wanted me to "do stuff" on webcam and over a period of time i finally accepted to one of them. I stripped and masturbated on camera to the boys. And for some reason it felt good.         About 3 years on and i am still doing it and i haven't told any of my friends. I am really ashamed of it but i suddenly become a really different person when online.      But i know that i am not in any way a slut. I never wear slutty clothes and i never dress up, its always just jeans and a t-shirt.       I don't want to be the person i am online but i really can't help it. I need to stop doing it before somebody finds out.       At school everyone calls me a boff and thats just wear it is, i like being a boff. I don't want to be anything else.      Please give me your honest opinion and help me as to how i can stop doing it.

20070612094232AAHjtDS	Social Science;Psychology	Convivere con un malato mentale?	Ho un padre malato mentale ormai da 17 anni. E' plateale, teatrale, si comporta come se stesse girando un film drammatico o come se fosse sul palco di una tragedia greca. Inoltre, è malato di depressione. E' già stato in manicomio una volta, ha frequentato vari psicologi. Quelli che lo conoscono da quando aveva un tenera età dicono che chiunque se lo fosse sposato era una cretina (mia madre!). Dicono che pestava sua sorella quasi per puro divertimento. Si riduce a stati psicologici orrendi: sembra drogato. A volte torna a casa dal lavoro che sembra abbia visto un fantasma, poi a tavola si addormenta nel piatto o piange disperatamente. Entra in camera mia come un pulcino bagnato e starebbe delle ore seduto accanto a me con gli occhi sgranati e fissi ad accarezzarmi (ho 17 anni, che cavolo!!!). Se gli dico qualcosa o se accenno al suo stato mentale è capace di riempirmi di legnat, alle quali sono molto tentato di rispondere. Ovviamente, mentre mi pesta si comporta come fosse Darth Vader!

I've been in two accidents in my life, both of which leave me nervous every time I'm in the car, because the driver was the most responsible, safe driver I know. I know that I can learn to be a safe driver myself, but I feel like I cannot account for being in the wrong place at the wrong time, and being hurt by someone else's stupidity.

Also when sending a telepathic thought to someone how do you do it? It says you have to clear stuff out your mind. but dont you have to think of th person you want to send it to in order for them to receive it.   3. And lastly what does it mean you have to be in the same frequency as someone in order to achieve Telepathy?   Please if you can answer any on them tell me. If you dont beleive in telepathy dont bother posting telling me it doesnt exist. It's my belief.

Estaba oyendo la conversación de una creatura muy  particular, la segunda que conozco, que dice que nunca en su vida ha pedido una disculpa. Esto en el sentido de que si ofende a alguien de cualquier forma, pues ya paso "y ya"   (ejemplo , si lo deja plantado o si dice algo que lo lastime etc)   o en el sentido de que interrumpe a personas en sus actividades para pedirles favores..pero no se disculpa por interrumpir. Piensa que esta en su derecho. (ejemplo al entrar a alguna oficina o despertar a alguien e interrumpir para que le solucionen X asunto).   Por el contrario conozco gente que se disculpa por cualquier cosa... si uno dice "tengo mucho calor" y te dice "lo siento" y asi por cualquier cosa de nada se disculpa o te dice que lo siente.   Se puede clasificar a ambos casos? que lo origina?   En lo personal, creo que prefiero al segundo, es menos arrogante ...pero aun asi raro yo creo que tuvo una dura infancia y los que nunca se disculpan se les permitia todo.   Que opinan?

20090227093146AA5RseW	Social Science;Psychology	How can I be myself, instead of something i'm not?	I have been what other people want me to be for so long that I think it's one reason why I had to deal with depression in my life. And also because of this I'm scared to attempt anything for fear of exposing myself to others. I always change my outward personality to suit the person/people i'm with; so that no one knows who I really am. I say so many things to suit the people I'm with, to please them and always doing what they want to do, afraid of rejection, so much so that I've developed fake phobias, likes and dislikes....just because it is easier than showing people what I'm really like. Now because i've been doing this for so long, i think i've lost myself. And lately I've just been getting so tired of having to live a double life. What can i do. this is holding me back from succeeding because i'm always watching myself around people. And one reason why I hide my true self is because i'm tooo weird, eccentric and "deep" for most people. and the time I accidentally let something of myself slip, the whole room got SSSOOO quiet; " this is not the funny, easy-going, relaxed happy-go-lucky girl we know" kinda quiet. I want to be me, but I think it might be too much for people, and for once I could give rat's @$$.

20090227103801AALEzOM	Social Science;Psychology	An ex friend who is VERY passive-aggressive....?	I used to be close friends with this girl who is EXTREMELY passive agressive. We used to hang out with our little posse of girls, being teenage girls in high school we were all, in my opinion, overly obsessed with getting boys, dressing slutty, gossiping about other girls who had never done a thing to us. Needless to say, it was all very petty and I know that this year I have changed for the better.   The leader of our little clique was this girl, let's call her L. She criticized every little thing about others; she talked crap about us and all of her friends. She would randomly pick fights about the stupidest, pettiest little things with any of us. this school year, I have sort of tapered off my friendships with that little clique; I really grew up a lot over the summer and made some new friends who are the complete opposite of my old clique; they are true, kind, funny people who I think the world of.    However, "L" decided I was a complete and total ***** for finding my own way and new friends, and has done everything in her power to hurt me. She printed out an old, embarrassing photo of me and taped it onto some of my friends lockers; she got one of her friends (one of my former friends) to ***** me out on facebook! no less. She's just trying to manipulate and blackmail me for absolutely no reason, other than the fact that I decided I didn't want to be controlled by her anymore.   My question is, how do I combat this? How do I stop being bothered by her? I just want her and those girls out of my life.

20090225094631AAY5lgb	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Why do some WOMEN have  requirements* of the opposite sex, when they themselves cannot always deliver the same?	That is the million dollar question.  First impressions are one thing.   But time is of the essence.  And that is the best possible way to   understand the depth of a personal relationship with another human   being on the opposite sex.  But I see that some women,  are always   having unrealistic expectations of men.  Or they are quote of quote   incomplete,  when the fact is,  they should complete themselves   first before anything else. For example,  if you have a ton of issues,   low self esteem, no real sense of self, no self love,  and is full of    deep seeded anger and resentment,  and is extremely misguided.   Then how can your perception of what is right for you be determined,   are you following me.  Love is a very complex issue.  To what   extent are you willing to go for this thing called love.   Love comes   when you have love for you.  How can the circle of love be complete   when one side of the scale if heavier than the other.  It cannot work.   A man cannot fix or change you,  if you are not willing to do so yourself.  Do you agree..................
