Balloons cause the death for countless numbers of sea turtles and whales. Balloons cause them to suffocate or starve to death (by blocking stomach or air valves). Also metallic balloons can cause power outages when they get caught in power lines. <br>  -Stop junk mail, it wastes paper and is thrown away. Us Yankees can request to stop getting junk mail by writing to a Mail Preference Service. If you don't have that type of service down under, just recycle them.<br>  -Use fluorescent lighting<br>  -NEVER, EVER flush anything down the toilet other than your *ahem*- you get what I mean... So don't flush your medicine or other products down there<br>  -When you need to throw away your medicine, make sure you put duct tape around the mouth of the container and put it in a plastic zip-lock bag, that way when it's dumped in a landfill, the chemicals from the medicine won't hurt the soil<br>  -Take shorter showers!

zqcR4YBvaa	You can buy a computer in China with any language operating system you want, including English. But they are not cheaper than in US.<br>  <br>  Most DVDs will work just fine, as they are region free.I occasionally send back DVDs and programs to people in the US and they work just fine. DVDs are CNY 7-20 depending on a lot of things. Programs about CNY 10-15.<br>  <br>  An Xbox 360 will cost about CNY 2,500 and a Wii will cost about CNY 1,800. These will be able to play "backup" games. You shouldn't try and play them on Xbox Live though as they might cut you off permanently. Games cost about CNY 7 in Shanghai.<br>  <br>  At most, you might need a power or outlet adapter for your electronics. The store you buy this at will be able to sell you that as well, prolly less than CNY 20.|`|AA11859553	DVD's won't work unless they are "region free". Electronics may not work in the US.

The games cost about 5 rmb which is about 75 cents. I live in Qingdao China and Usually dvd's and video games are cheaper in Shanghai..  If you like brand name clothes there's plenty of fake brands for fairly cheap..  Just remember when you do come here you have to negotiate the price of things. If your in a place like Beijing the clothes vendor will say crazy high prices hoping a foriegner wont know the difference.

Even then, I doubt that anyone would get it spot on.  <br>  <br>  There's all different accents, too, depending on which area of Scotland you're in.  Like, someone said we all say tatties. Where I'm from (Glasgow), most people I know say totties (without pronouning the Ts).  So, there's a huge difference between the different areas.  <br>  <br>  I suppose you could pick up some of the accent if you worked hard enough on it.  But, you'd probably have to choose a district from Scotland, and stick to it.  Cos, as I said, it varies a great deal.  <br>  <br>  So, decide which type of accent you're looking for, and maybe listen to some stuff from there.  Most of it will probably either be from Glasgow or Edinburgh, or maybe even from the Highlands (some of them I cannae even understand ;).  You can listen to some stuff on Youtube.  I've heard lots of Glaswegian stuff on there.  Whether you can understand it or not is another thing, lol.  <br>  <br>  Other than that, the only way to really understand it, and get into it, is to live here for a while.|`|a6864b98763d4f13080c1e56782e7578aa	I am an australian who lives in scotland, its rather easy.

tV7ZYIeEaa	I would split 2 parks each day MK and Epcot day 1 AK HS day 2 if you have a park hopper. If you do it that way you might be able to do everything you listed.

There will be fewer onsite guest in that park.<br>  <br>  MK and Epcot typically take the longest so split the days but don't do those 2 on the same day.<br>  <br>  AK closes the earliest of all the parks so hit it at opening and switch midday to MK<br>  <br>  following day...depends on when you are going but typically I would say hit Disney Studios first, then take a water taxi to Epcot.<br>  <br>  I would avoid eating at peak meal time and stick to counter service to save time.<br>  <br>  <br>  My favorite tip...In MK eat a late lunch/early dinner at pecos bills during the 3o'clock parade. You get great seats for the parade and you are multi-tasking<br>  <br>  ETA: if staying onsite take advantage of EMH, but plan around the fact that in addition to the general public, many onsite guest will be there either right after (if an AM EMH) or right before (If a PM EMH).<br>  <br>  Even this can work to your advantage if it is an AM EMH. Hit everything you can in the front of the park during EMH, then head straight to the back of the park as soon as the park opens to the general public.|`|1y5ibNbZaa	You may want to pick two parks you want to see the most and do those.  The Magic Kingdom is a must and has the most to do...I'm 25 and still love the Magic Kingdom.  Being able to have time to do everything depends on how busy the parks are.  I went in December for only three days and if it hadn't been for the extra magic hours resort guests benefit from, we wouldn't have been able to do much of anything.  We didn't even have time to go to the Animal Kingdom and spent all day at Epcot and only rode Soarin' and Test Track....so if you have to knock something out skip Epcot and try the Magic Kingdom and Hollywood Studios or the Animal Kingdom.|`|PE13Cc5baa	Animal Kingdom-<br>  It's tough to Be a Bug! 3D show    +<br>  Kilimanjaro Safari  +<br>  Kali river rapids +<br>  Expedition everest - travel sickness is a big no no +<br>  Primeval whirl  children like it adults done<br>  DINOSAUR        is a must +<br>  <br>  Hollywood-<br>  Indiana Jones show +<br>  Star tours<br>  Rock n' Roller coaster +<br>  Tower of Terror +<br>  <br>  Epcot-<br>  Mission Space +<br>  Test track +<br>  Soarin' +<br>  Honey, I shrunk the audience +<br>  <br>  Magic Kingdom-<br>  Pirates of the Caribbean +<br>  Splash Mountain +<br>  Big Thunder Mountain Railroad +<br>  Tomorrowlan Indy Speedway dont do it<br>  Space Mountain +<br>  Astro Orbiter   dont do it <br>  <br>  <br>  sorry i marked in + but my keyboard is playing up, and sorry i marked ever 1 but they all so good|`|cmK9Go1gaa	You can do all of it... If you want to be completely dead by the end of each day. II would recommend a park a day, but if your set on going to all...FYI, if you want to see all the countries in Epcot (1000% recommended!) Plan to spend at least 3/4 of your day there and combine it with MGM (hollywood or Animal kingdom) Have Fun!!!<br>  <br>  P.S.

I'm estimating flight time, not layover time.|`|yex8me0taa	It mainly depends upon the flight route and type of airplane that you will be flying on, among a number of other factors such as weather and layovers. It is wisest to check with your airline carrier for flight times always vary! For example, my brother has taken a flight from Chicago to Nashville that lasted only 45 minutes. However, my flight from Chicago to Nashville lasted 1 1/2 hours + 30 minutes due to bad weather.=2 hours!<br>  <br>  Having flown to Hawaii once, it took us about 14 hours to fly from Nashville, TN to the island of Maui, Hawaii, not including layovers.<br>  <br>  My best advice to you is to book an early morning flight! In this way, you will be less affected by layovers (flight delays), and it will allow you more time to adjust to Hawaii's time zone once you arrive there. It is highly likely that you will experience "jetlag", as my family did, so make sure to get plenty of rest. Depending on the time that you will be leaving South Dakota and arriving in Hawaii, sleep only as you would if you were already on Hawaii's time. This will greatly help you! Therefore, only sleep on the plane if you would be it you were already in Hawaii.<br>  <br>  Also, make sure to use sunscreen in Hawaii! I know that that may sound funny, but you will get a nice tan as long as you go outside for a little while! =)  Having a suntan while flying in an aircraft's pressurized environment (cabin) while being thousands of feet in the air does not feel good! <br>  <br>  =)  If you go to Hawaii, you will surely have one of, if not the, best experiences of your life!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  ++some eXXtra Tips and Info! =)<br>  <br>  P.S. * If you DO fly to Hawaii, you will be required to sign a type of form while still on the airplane. This indicates that you are not bringing something, such as a snake, that is not allowed to be brought into the state of Hawaii. While it's usually no matter of concern, make sure that you are abiding by the rules, and know the proper, basic information that you are to fill in. No one will leave the airplane until all forms have been signed and turned in to the working flight attendant.<br>  <br>  *ALSO, when you leave Hawaii, you will have your baggage placed through a type of "Customs" check. You are not allowed to take anything from the island (such as live plants, etc.).

gTqo2Vz3aa	London is a very strange place to live as alot of the rougher areas close to town are expensive and the nice parts are cheaper because there out of town.<br>  <br>  As to where to live it would depend on what you want. Familys are better suited to the suburbs, places like barnet, cockfosters, chingford, dartford etc<br>  <br>  if you wants somewhare safe, decent and resonably priced look no further than woodford. its on the central line eastbound (about 20 mins to liverpool street). There are lots of decent pubs, shops and bars aswell. Property is mainly Victorian houses ranging from lush detached to terraces. for a room expect to pay from 300 to 650 pcm.<br>  <br>  In East London there is also Hornchurch, which is on the district line, cheaper than woodford but less pleasing on the eye, its got a nice range of pubs and a broadway with bars and shops.<br>  <br>  the cheapest area in london is dagenham, which is a massive spraul of concil houses on the outside of london. It was completly english till about 3 years ago but since then its changed alot and is probably 60%.<br>  <br>  Bexley borough is the 2nd cheapest. It is very safe with next to no crime and is mainly 1950's style housing.<br>  <br>  Advoid Newham, despite having some top pubs it is genuinly a tip, very rough and you will get in trouble if you can't handle yourself. Also Harlesden is a tip, most of London is to be fair but thats what gives it its charm i guess.<br>  <br>  id recomend for the mix of value and lowish crime rates:<br>  <br>  Romford<br>  Chingford<br>  Bexley<br>  Old Ford<br>  Wanstead<br>  Southgate<br>  High Barnet<br>  Uxbridge<br>  Dartford<br>  Purley<br>  South Croydon<br>  Bromley|`|km9cQNAXaa	Cheapest probably is somewhere you would not want to live. Relatively close to central London the area round the "Elephant and Castle" is about as horrible as it gets. <br>  <br>  Check the papers for where all the teenage stabbings are going on and avoid it like the plague. Most of these are drug related.<br>  <br>  Best I can suggest is to head East and look for somewhere that will benefit from the 2012 Olympic Games. That limits you to the area around Stratford.

iCMrsV9daa	The one message that is being conveyed to children on both sides of this fray is that the other side is a bloodthirsty monster. In Israel, this was instantly translated into gains for the hate-mongering Yisrael Beytenu party headed by the xenophobic Avigdor Lieberman, who is now the front-runner in mock polls being held in many Jewish high schools, with the hawkish Binyamin Netanyahu coming in second.<br>  <br>  Hatred, in other words, is the great winner of this war. It has helped mobilize racist mobs, and as the soccer chant indicates it has left absolutely no place for the other, undermining even basic empathy for innocent children. Israel’s masters of war must be happy: the seeds of the next wars have certainly been sown.|`|NJnnVuzBaa	Good question, Son.<br>  It seems that the holocaust reminder the Jews have been promoting did not work after all. <br>  The saddest part of that is that the folks that did suffer the most, turned out to be the ones doing it 60 years later.<br>  Maybe that's why we need a set of War Crime Trials to teach our kids the true values of life.<br>  Many pro-peace, anti-war communities have been working against the clock to send some Jews on the stand, for the sake of the younger generations.<br>  No, I am not saying that only one side is right or wrong, but it is obvious that the Jews have the lion's share in war crimes, Nazi techniques and apartheid planning.<br>  I am not connected in any way to any of the two races in conflict here, so maybe my opinion is less biased, that's all.<br>  A star for your Q, Son!

It makes you wonder whether Palestinian leaders have any humanity at all, using Palestinian children as human shields.

ZPxJNpMxaa	here is my answer to a similar question :<br>  <br>  Let me start with are the police effective or corrupt? The police have a reputation for being corrupt and cases of corrupt policeman are on the increase. Jackie Selebe, the commissioner of police is facing criminal and corruption charges, amongst a number of others and this is what has been exposed, it is too frightening to even think how rife it is.<br>  <br>  Crime is everywhere in the world but some of our crime statistics unfortunately speak for themselves, so it is important irrespective of where you are in SA to take common sense precautions as well as consistently being vigilant.<br>  <br>  I have either spent quite some time in or lived in the 4 cities you have mentioned and without exception each city has its "no go" areas, but each city also has a lot to do and see. The CBD of Johannesburg is the worst of the 4. Cape Town for me is by far the best city and if I were you I would spend more time there than in the other cities.<br>  <br>  Here is a helpful link in terms of safety in SA, there are many more just search for them on this forum.<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <br>  Do not believe everything you read about SA, SA is without a doubt worth a visit, and that is not a biased opinion, the number of tourists visiting SA is on the increase.<br>  <br>  In terms of tourist attraction in Durban, have a look at this link, there are many more just google them.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.tripadvisor.in/Attractions-g312595-Activities-Durban_Zululand_KwaZulu_Natal.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.tripadvisor.in/Attractions-g3...</a>|`|Snwfwx73aa	dude, firstly, chill :)<br>  SA is not bad, if we were so bad, we would not be hosting the Fifa 2010 WC, nor would we have hosted the cricket WC or the Rugby WC and other international events.<br>  Yes there is crime in SA, is it so bad to the extent that tourists should not visit?

On the way back it's a different story<br>  <br>  Well, Dr Pepper, you are yet again wrong. The flight time is counted from PUSHBACK, not takeoff time. Because takeoff time can largely differ, depending on air traffic, weather, etc. The 40-50 minutes less can occur because of better weather, ATC clearance onto a quicker route, etc. And sometimes it can take longer, especially if there is bad weather. Pilots must then slow down, and ATC will probably try to direct them around it, which can take longer as well.<br>  <br>  I am talking about "Block Time", the time from pushback to the time of arrival.

EJpiaCMQaa	You don't have to check-in online, but I highly recommend it.  Southwest Airlines doesn't have assigned seating, and you want to get into the first boarding group "A" so you can get a good seat.  You also want to be one of the first on board to make sure there will be space for your carry-on bag.  If you don't check in online, you can check in at the airport.  That is more time-consuming and you'll be in group "C", the last group of passengers to board.  It's basically up to you.  <br>  <br>  You do have to print out the boarding pass if you check in online.  You don't need any special paper, just plain white paper for printing.|`|1bTYCUDkaa	No, you do not have to check-in online for any Southwest Airlines flight, but it is recommended.  A lot of people do check-in online so they can obtain 'A' boarding.  But, if you do decide to check-in online, it will be exactly 24 hours before your scheduled departure time.  Be on www.southwest.com at least five minutes before to complete this process as efficiently as possible.  Click check-in online when the clock on the computer says your departure time.  Type in your conformation number, which can be found in the conformation email, and type in your booking name (last name).  Check the box with your name, and click, "Print Boarding Pass".  <br>      Yes, on "check-in online", you do print your boarding pass off of the computer.  You do not need to bring any specific paper, but the boarding pass, to the airport.  That is all you need, and of course, a picture ID.|`|AA11580836	I have not flown Southwest as of yet but as a matter of fact one of my cousins flew down to come visit and she is leaving tomorrow and just awhile awhile she was on my computer printing out her boarding pass. I, myself have done that as well a few years ago with United Express and all I did was print it out at home and then check-in myself with one of the self check-in things and that was all. If I am not mistaken, nowadays alot of airlines and airports are using the self check-in function to make things move much faster.|`|7fc18f68782ac15e766870d83a5cc6bdaa	Just an FYI, I am a pilot for US Airways. You do not have to check in online for any airline. But, for any airline it is recommended that you check in early, because most carriers comply with the "first come first serve" policy. Which means, if we need to bump 3 passengers due to overbooking, then the last three that checked in will be bumped. <br>  <br>  On SWA, they board their aircraft in an obscure way. Their boarding passes are marked with 3 different groups. A, B, and C. Of course, the A group boards first, and who ever boards first has their choice of seats. It is very primitive that they do not offer advanced select seating. <br>  <br>  I recommend you check in 24 hours prior to departure.|`|rDsKB0uXaa	Call them.

AA10258539	Let me make a suggestion. Write down all the things you want to accomplish six months down the road. Basically, it is what you see for yourself six months from now. Put that in a bottle on top of your dresser where you can see it everyday.  It will remind you of the promises you made for yourself. After six months, see for yourself if you have been able to keep your promises. Start small, like what you want to achieve in two weeks time. Work your way up the ladder until you can plan for the whole year. Break it down into small manageable pieces.

Lincoln Memorial, Washington Monument, Jefferson Memorial, The Wall, the WWII monument, The Capitol Building, White House, Supreme Court, Library of Congress, Smithsonian, National Archive, National Air and Space Museum.  And across the river is Arlington Cemetery and the Pentagon.  There is enough for weeks of exploration.

It makes you a better and happier mom.  I went through the same thing when my kids were younger and if you never get any "me" time you can become resentful, sad, angry, etc.  Your husband, if he truly loves you and has your best interest in mind, should have no problem with you going.  Maybe if you go it will spur him on to get his passport so that he can join you next time.  Hope everything works out for you.|`|yrue6Qjwaa	If you think you need th vacation then go for it!! Make arrangements for a babysitter and have fun!
Jm3vMKx3aa	At present citizens of Taiwan cannot travel to the Republic of Ireland without a valid visa. The French student visa will not exempt from the visa requirement since the United Kingdom and Ireland are not members of the Schengen agreement and visa issued by the European countries on the continent are not recognized.<br>  <br>  The United Kingdom however will change its visa procedures effective 3rd March 2009. Citizens of Taiwan do not need a visa for tourist travel for up to 180 days any more. SInce both countries the UK and Ireland form a Common Travel Area they usually also grant visa-free access to the same countries. I would inquire at the Irish Embassy in Paris whether the requirements for Taiwanese passport holders will change in Ireland, too.

3LmXfFoBaa	I would recommend the Raleigh area, I moved here 2.5 years ago from Wisconsin. There are several up and coming areas (Apex, Cary, Durham - is going through revitalization, Morrisville, Wake Forest, Chapel Hill - for great schools). Rents will seem much lower than the NE. The area has plentiful employment and a ton to do. Just 2.5 hours to either the beach or the mountains. Today it was 60 degrees!<br>  <br>  Keep in mind Raleigh is considered one of the "hottest real estate markets" in the US right now, so although in other areas of the US it is a buyer's market, it is not so much in this area.|`|YaM8Elxtaa	Asheville is a nice town.|`|4oq98pBNaa	hickory nc and very nice.

hcgaizJCaa	From what i've read, airfare is not expected to go down this year. Check out www.farecast.live.com. You can type in your originating and destination city and it will predict whether the fare will drop based on recent trends.|`|AA11713693	No they are not. The best time to buy them is when the low season is in.|`|AA11496012	The ticket price should be reasonable since September is not peak travel season because students/children are back in school so fewer people are flying.  I would start looking now and book a ticket at least 1 month before you fly out.
32dffe7e0eba9eb2c4e6c9418ec99ba5aa	The order is usually first-come, first-served, with occasional exceptions.  Sometimes the order is slightly changed, depending on an individual aircraft's performance and position or other factors.  This may be done well in advance of take-off or landing, or quite late in the process.<br>  <br>  For example, it might be advantageous to clear a small Cessna for take-off before a 747, since the 747 could create wake turbulence that might endanger the Cessna, whereas the Cessna's wake would have no effect on the 747.  Or, during landing, one aircraft might have a higher minimum speed than another, and thus it might be useful to put the fast aircraft in front of the slow one.  These are somewhat simplistic examples, but you get the idea.<br>  <br>  It's not so much a matter of deciding some specific order and then following that slavishly as it is a matter of looking at the traffic picture dynamically and making any adjustments required, while trying to keep the number of required sequencing changes at a minimum.|`|fZjgIE9Baa	I am not an Air Traffic controller, but they determine it by the order the pilots call in for takeoff and landing, and if there are aircraft ahead of you to takeoff and land, you will receive a number. (#2 to land, #2 to takeoff, etc.) If there are other "active runways" available when taking off or landing, pilots will be assigned to use them to avoid traffic.|`|JQg9jKXSaa	All the following above are correct but there is also another way as well.  When flying commercially all aircraft work off a flight plan from one airport to another.  (ie LAX-SFO)   Unfortunately some airports need air traffic slowed down due to weather.  (ie SFO, JFK, BOS, etc.)  So to do this, air traffic controllers limit the amount of departures and arrivals to an airport.  They also issue times on when the aircraft can takeoff and when it can land so that way they can plan accordingly of how much space they will have in the airspace's that the aircraft will be flying in.  Along with all this at some very busy us airports each aircraft must meet a schedule arrival and touchdown time or wait to be issued another.  But long delays at airports usually caused by weather which in turn causes airport delays on aircraft arrivals, boarding, takeoffs and landings.  As you can see its a long answer to a short question with many factors behind the what-have-yous.  Hope this helps
PxDuUakZaa	I am a British Citizen, female and just returned from three weeks travelling in Iran. I currently live in Jordan in the Middle east working in an Embassy and so am familiar with the Muslim culture. I have travelled extensively globally. Iran is one of the friendliest, safest countries I have ever visited.  The people are embarassingly hospitable, genuinely curious about you and your country, very well informed about events and perceptions outside of their country, politically astute, extremely dissatisfied with their government and unhappy about the perception the rest of the western world has about them.  I was travelling with a small group of 8 ( mainly women) and a guide. We traversed the country and covered thousands of kilometres staying in both small communities in the desert/mountains/countryside and the major towns.  Although , as women, we had to cover and there was no alcohol available, these minor frustrations were worth it for the incredible experience that is visiting Iran. I also have friends there who work in the oil industry and who have been living there for several years and they are loving the experience.  I would encourage anyone who has the opportunity to visit this beautiful country and meet these lovely people. Not once did I feel unsafe and was always treated with the utmost respect.|`|jxCS9DToaa	No, one of my very good friends who is a woman, left last Thursday for Iran for a 3 month stay.

G2h8g2g1aa	1. Parking garages mostly don't have names, they're called "Self Park" and nobody calls them "parking ramps."  It is not a case of somebody not knowing how to read, it is poor wording on your part.  It sounds more like you're asking for the name of an exit (ramp) you take to get to Union Station from 90/94.<br>  <br>  2. The entrance to the self-park parking garage is located on S Canal between Van Buren & Jackson on the west side of the street.  Here is a picture of it on a map and as you can see it looks like a typical self park in Chicago, a multi-leveled garage with an elevator: <a href="http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&layer=c&cbll=41.877172,-87.639566&panoid=3Jo099nxF19mIosOtmYXtw&cbp=12,315.0919922551785,,0,-2.1085937500000007&ll=41.877172,-87.639566&spn=0,303.75&z=4" rel="nofollow">http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&layer=c&...</a> It is not difficult to find.  It is the large building with no walls.  From the street you can see that it is full of cars.  It is very hard to miss.  Look for the big signs that probably reads "Self Park."|`|bcTErNF6aa	Are you talking about Lake Shore Drive / starts at Holly wood goes to High way 90 94 which takes you to Union Station there's nothing across the street from Union Station except parking lots driving Lake Shore Drive is beautiful at night the lites High rise buildings cool wish you the best.

It's at the southern end of the Strip.  It's pretty kitchy and is a little worn and outdated.  The Paris is mid-Strip and right across the street from the Bellagio - so if you get a room with a view, you might be lucky enough to catch a view of the fountain show at night.  I'd go with the Paris.  The restaurant at the top of the Eiffel Tower is great, too!|`|NHjttkdRaa	Out of your 2 choices I would stay at the Paris and get a room facing the Bellagio/Strip.<br>  <br>  Personally I'm not a big fan of either one.<br>  <br>  If you like email with other questions about Vegas.|`|253482494b641664e98bd02505a8445aaa	<a href="http://www.vegas.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.vegas.com/</a><br>  <br>  www.visitlasvegas.com<br>  <br>  www.lasvegas.com|`|PVQXOmUAaa	I know its not one of the ones above but I LOVE the palms<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.palms.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.palms.com/</a>|`|bec79a634c4d9b7c0723d8449a3b49f9aa	Paris is a slightly more luxurious hotel overall (4-Diamond) and does have some 'romantic' things about it, but it's just borrowing romantic ideas from the real Paris and recreating them like Disneyland.<br>  <br>  Luxor is still clean and comfortable (3-Diamond) and has a more 'sexier' vibe, with places like Cathouse and LAX, and it's a more uniquely Las Vegas environment.  The spa suites are nice if you seriously want to use the spa tub a few times, otherwise you are just paying for the novelty value.<br>  <br>  Neither hotel has really great views unless you pay extra at Paris for the privilege of looking across the street at a nicer hotel (Bellagio).<br>  <br>  The crowd at Luxor is mostly people in 20s/30s who want to have a fun time in Vegas, the crowd at Paris is mostly people in their 40s with Harrah's Total Rewards cards that don't gamble quite enough to get invited to Caesars.<br>  <br>  At the end of the day though, there really is enough at either hotel for you to have a fun, sexy, romantic, first trip to Vegas... most of that stuff is up to you anyway!

Ciao Anna|`|QCvExW9waa	dunque considerando che andrai nel periodo di settembre sarà molto più facile realizzare una vacanza come la vuoi tu e cioè lontana dalle frenesie del ferragosto. Cercherò di darti un consiglio il più obiettivo possibile anche se non nego che ti sto proponendo un luogo al quale sono molto affezionato. Si tratta di chia nel sud della sardegna e al contrario della maggior parte dei luoghi in sardegna qui potrai  sempretrovare un pezzo di spiaggia deserta solo per te.avrai a disposizione lunghissimi litorali di sabbia bianca e dune costellate di ginepri alle spalle di stagni calmissimi dove vivono colonie di fenicotteri rosa..a chia c'è una luce particolare,il colore dell'acqua è di un azzurro intenso,la vegetazione è ancora praticamente intatta insomma tutto ti darà la parvenza di trovarti in un luogo selvaggio.Avrai poi a disposizione una vasta serie di spiagge tra le quali scegliere la tua preferita(io ti consiglio quella di su giudeu).qui vicino posso consigliarti il bed and breckfast su giudeu a gestione familiare(non credo che sia caro e ha dei bei loggiati che danno sul panorama di chia)inoltre non è lontano dalla spiaggia.Se poi vorrai spostarti ed esplorare la zona puoi percorrere la costa verso sud e trovare un litorale veramente pittoresco dove spiagge e calette si insinuano tra le scogliere( devi fare almeno un salto alla spaiggia di tuerredda).Oppure salendo verso cagliari incontrerai santa margherita di pula località altrettanto bella ma meno selvaggia e pula col sito archeologico di nora antica città romana( qui vicino si trovano famose discoteche frequentate dagli stessi cagliaritani se ti interessa).Se vuoi dar sfogo al tuo amore per la natura puoi andare alla riserva d is cannoneris verso domus de maria dove vive una numerosa colonia di cervi sardi. Insomma se vai a chia potrai fare veramente tutto quello che vorrai e vivere una vacanza con la A maiuscola.|`|VFQfE1R6aa	quasi tutti ti hanno nonminato posti che tutto sono tranne che tranquilli!!!mi vorrete dire che le Bombarde ad alghero sono belle ma che non ci sia un carnaio no...l'Asinara è un arcipelago e ci puoi andare solo in escursione, stintino è meravigliosa ma è presa d'assalto e ha 40 mq di spiaggia,villasimius bellissima...ma dove la vogliamo far alloggiare??non dico questo per convincerti a venire nella mia zona, ma se vuoi posti incontaminati tranquilli e con spiagge belle, potresti venire nella mia zona, potrei affittarti un appartamento, sei a 40 minuti da tutti questi posti caotici, abbiamo 11 km di spiaggia libera, solo 2 tratti di pochi metri sono a pagamento....|`|W8VqbWHraa	Porto Pino nel sulcitano..... 2km di sabbia bianchissima .... e dune.... e acqua limpida...|`|cde793f76550acfc5642660371066a73aa	cala luna /dorgali), chia (pula), cala coticcio (caprera), cala d' arena (la maddalena),la pelosa (stintino), rena bianca (santa teresa), rena bianca (portisco), is arutas (cabras), dune di piscinas, cala brandinchi, la spiaggia di costa paradiso, cala domestica, e tante altre che non ricordo<br>  <br>  qui nel sito ufficiale del turismo della sardegna trovi informazioni su tutte le spiagge (foto, servizi, come raggiungerle): <a href="http://www.sardegnaturismo.it/offerta/mare/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sardegnaturismo.it/offerta/ma...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  questa invece è cala coticcio a caprera: <a href="http://www.barca-vela.com/mediterraneo/caprera.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.barca-vela.com/mediterraneo/c...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  x stella a stintino non esiste solo la pelosa, che in + quest' anno per motivi di salvaguardia forse non sarà fruibile dai bagnanti, ma ci sono spiagge kilometriche, come quella delle saline, completamente libere, e poi ci sono le varie calette deserte sulla costa ovest di stintino|`|z81V9lLLaa	le migliori spiagge.<br>  ce ne sono tantissime. <br>  tantissime davvero.<br>  <br>  la Sardegna è bella tutta.<br>  <br>  se dovessi capitare nell'Arcipelago di La Maddalena.. beh.<br>  a parte il giro in barca alle Isole, ti consiglio la spiaggia del Relitto, Monti d'a Rena, Baia Trinita, Cala Andreana, Cala Serena, Cala Coticcio, Cala Garibaldi.. ehm.<br>  <br>  te le consiglio tutte ; )

For hotels, I would really reccommend the Radisson.  It is right on the beach and it's close to everything! shopping, food, etc.  this is their website : <a href="http://www.radisson.com/aruba?s_cid=rdaruba15" rel="nofollow">http://www.radisson.com/aruba?s_cid=rdar...</a><br>  <br>  if you have any other questions please feel free to email me!<br>  Happy Early Birthday!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|yAzokUKbaa	La vegas<br>  is so cheap and fun<br>  try<br>  u don't be disappoint|`|SFICPUNjaa	Why dont you go on a cruise. Out of Miami you can take Carnival to the Bahamas for around $300. each (a must see is Atlantis on Paradise Island) the only problem might be is you cant drink or gamble unless your 21.<br>  You also need a passport. Happy 18th!!!!!!!
S4soZUFCaa	The weather, that's about it. It has a lot of violent crime thanks to all the immigrants from good old Mexico. I think 40% of all crime is by illegals.|`|YkseyT7zaa	We know where McCain is.|`|m5J36D28aa	130F in the summer?|`|hfigZbx5aa	Waiting to Exhale, Song of the South, The Gauntlet, Psycho, Raising Arizona, Jerry Maguire, The Prophecy, Used Cars, Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure (used as a stand-in for San Dimas, California), U Turn, Eight Legged Freaks, Private Lessons, Blue Collar Comedy Tour: The Movie, Never Been Thawed, Just One of the Guys, Terminal Velocity, Taxi, and The Banger Sisters were all shot here. <br>  <br>  Several museums are scattered around the valley including the Phoenix Art Museum. One of the most well-known museums in the area is the Heard Museum just north of downtown. It has over 130,000 square feet (12,000 m2) of gallery, classroom and performance space. Some of the signature exhibits include a full Navajo hogan, the Mareen Allen Nichols Collection containing 260 pieces of contemporary jewelry, the Barry Goldwater Collection of 437 historic Hopi kachina dolls, and an exhibit on the 19th century boarding school experiences of Native Americans. The Heard Museum attracts about 250,000 visitors a year.<br>  <br>  We also have the Arizona Science Center, Fleischer Museum, Hall of Flame Firefighting Museum, Arizona Historical Society Museum, Phoenix Museum of History, the Phoenix Zoo, and the Pueblo Grande Museum and Cultural Park<br>  <br>  Old town Glendale also has interesting places, including a Bead museum and Mystic shops for anything with astrology, Tarot, Runes, Aura reading, etc etc etc. We have a HUGE gay pride festival that is an absolute ball to attend.<br>  <br>  Tempe is a fun University town with tons of things to do locally. As far as PHX (the "main" city) there's not too much. The most of this stuff is in the PHX metro area. <br>  <br>  We have a largely Hispanic demographic.<br>  At the 2007 U.S. Census estimates, the city's population was:<br>  <br>  76.7% White (Including white mixed with others)<br>  48.1% non-Hispanic-White alone<br>  6.0% Black or African American <br>  2.4% American Indian and Alaska Native <br>  2.7% Asian <br>  0.2% Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander <br>  14.1% some other race <br>  1.9% two or more races <br>  41.5% Hispanic or Latino of any race|`|kOoCya9Oaa	Cardinals,Suns.Diamondbacks<br>  Great weather<br>  Great restaurants<br>  Great resorts<br>  Great parks<br>  Salt river tubing<br>  Hiking<br>  Etc.|`|Unk4zu2Naa	its hot <br>  and there are cute guys|`|CPWrxvE5aa	Well first of all it has...well you see...check this out...ok..it is a place where you would...hmm...I can tell you this...if i was to move there I would...hmm...this is what I know about the place...well...Ok I have it..no wait..hmm...I think...no wait...Ok Ok...got it...it is a place where you can be....no...hmm..well you see...I heard..no..hmm...Ok..you see...well...hmm...If I...no...hmm|`|NfPuCUceaa	Phoenix Suns basketball team ;)|`|cBtFp2aYaa	well i lived there for a whole year <br>  its hot lol and when its cold its cold.<br>  diverse people of all ethnics
ef3e8a055f877ac48bf7cb67749b1830aa	My sister is getting married in a month so I've spent months researching this.  What exactly is your question?<br>  <br>  Most cruises have a section down at the bottom (try site map) that lists the info on weddings.<br>  <br>  www.royalwed.com<br>  <br>  is the company that most of the cruise liners use to do the weddings.  The price varies based on what island you want, what month, what ship...Royal Caribbean has about a 27 pg brochure on the topic.<br>  <br>  There is also an additional fee for added guests that you'll need to consider that it roughly $40 per guest.  They have packages that include 8 guests or 20 guests but any additional will cost.<br>  <br>  Give me a little more detail and I can probably answer all your questions on it.|`|cb1c8e5fcd8492bc3787fd1b614481ecaa	Weddings are done in various ports. Contrary to what people think the Captain can not perform marriages. You must provide the wedding official. The cruise line will provide facilities and refreshments for a fee. Go to the site of any major cruise line and search for "wedding". You will find details there. For example here is Carnival's page.<br>  <a href="http://www.carnival.com/cms/fun/weddings/weddings.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.carnival.com/cms/fun/weddings...</a><br>  <br>  ? ??l???q ?|`|h6NqNzHAaa	<a href="http://www.theweddingexperience.com/cruiseship.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.theweddingexperience.com/crui...</a>

I'd like to visit LA and SF but if u have already been there and seen the most important places i'd choose BosWash. I've heard Was and Balt are dangerous if u live there but when being a tourist i think its safer. <br>  I'd like to go to Toronto too and see the CN tower ^^<br>  Greets from zaragoza! b-bye|`|nDv2EtuGaa	I don't know much about the West coast, but I've lived in the Baltimore/Washington area for over 20 years.  Baltimore, Washington and Philly are not dangerous cities to visit if you keep to the 'touristy' parts.  Don't go wandering from those areas, especially at night.<br>  Baltimore is a charming city with the Orioles ballpark within walking distance of downtown.  It boasts the National Aquarium, and has several art galleries and museums as well as some interesting nightlife in the older area of Fells Point.  In Baltimore you MUST try Maryland Steamed Crabs or Crab-cakes.<br>  Washington is a fascinating city, great for tourists, with monuments, museums, etc.  My favorite is the Jefferson Memorial on the Tidal basin.<br>  Don't forget Annapolis, an interesting old state capital which houses the Naval Academy.  Also there are a handful of Civil War battlefields within driving distance of the cities in Antietam, Gettysburg etc.  Harper's Ferry is not too far away, too.<br>  Then there's Lancaster County, PA, which is an interesting area with Amish culture and good food—eaten family-style.<br>  A little further afield is Skyline Drive in the Blue Ridge mountains and the impressive caverns in Luray.
0ZfZulnzaa	Most major car rental places require you to be at least 21(some are 25) and have a major credit card.|`|azypqsphaa	nope|`|4cWtH7X2aa	You could with Enterprise at one point. They were the only ones that would rent to you w/o a credit card if you're under 21. They take a $300 deposit if I remember correctly, Unless the policy has changed in recent years. I'm pretty sure I rented a car at 20 but that would've been a few years ago.|`|8cc98e2cb46c2658bbe3bb50f1182822aa	As long as you have a valid drivers license and a major credit card you can rent. it's much more expensive if you're less than 25 years old.

G0RZQORMaa	USPS tracking is not the best. They updated the status my package when it reached the local USPS unit and then i got it that day, but for the 5-7 days after it reached JFK there were no tracking updates. USPS call center is not very helpfull either. All you can do is wait. But after my experience I have decided to pay some more and use DHL or FedEx next time when something is urgent. <br>  Plus you have to condsider the extra load the postal service during this time of the year. And also depends on how far you are located from JFK. Depending on the service you chose its going to come via ground from JFK. I live in NYC and still it took 7 days for me to get it after it got to JFK.
