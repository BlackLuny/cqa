Students stand up for theirselves and it makes them responisible.      Thanks everyone for answering

People are self-centered. I'd rather have one self-centered person than 200 million of them with a voice.      Looking at the world today, it's clear Democracy is the worst form of government out there. Society is losing control everywhere. You can only have one king in every country; everyone thinks that they are the king now.      I predict democracy is going to be finished soon. Too many people are abusing their freedoms. Things are out of control out there. It's getting ridiculous. People need to be ruled and subjugated. It's a fact of life.      I think democracy is going to end in my lifetime. It might end sooner because of the economic crisis. I wouldn't be surprised if many people embraced the end of democracy either. If you can't maintain a democracy in wartime, why should it be maintained in peace? That makes no sense!

20090307030559AA3W8bK	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	An oldie but still a goody?	The marriage of an 80 year old man and a 20 year old woman was the talk of the town.         After being married a year, the couple went to the hospital for the birth of their first child.                  The attending nurse came out of the delivery room to congratulate the old gentleman and said,           'This is amazing.  How do you do it at your age?'          The old man grinned and said, 'You got to keep the old motor running.'          The following year, the couple returned to the hospital for the birth of their second child.            The same nurse was attending the delivery and again went out to congratulate the old gentleman.          She said, 'Sir, you are something else.  How do you manage it?'          The old man grinned and said, 'You gotta keep the old motor running.'          A year later, the couple returned to the hospital for the birth of their third child.           The same nurse was there for this birth also and, after the delivery, she once again approached the old gentleman,           smiled, and said, 'Well, you surely are something else!  How do you do it?'              The old man replied, 'It's like I've told you before, you gotta keep the old 'motor running.'          The nurse, still smiling, patted him on the back and said:           Well, I guess it's time to change the oil. This one's black.      x x x
20090307025639AAlzhNl	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rock and Pop	Do you like this Aerosmith cover?	It's a cover of "Dream On" performed by Yngwie Malmsteen and Ronnie James Dio.  I think it's a pretty good cover.  My only big complaint is that Yngwie over plays the song big time, especially with the obnoxious intro shredding that overshadows the song's rhythm.  But I think Dio's singing is awesome and I can really feel the passion in his voice.       http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=APRi4EYDd...       What do you guys think of it?

Second one says, 'No, it's Thursday!'   Third one says, 'So am I. Let's go get a beer.'      A man was telling his neighbor, 'I just bought a new hearing aid. It cost me four thousand dollars, but it's state of the art. It's perfect.' 'Really,'   answered the neighbor . 'What kind is it?' 'Twelve thirty.'      Morris, an 82 year-old man, went to the doctor to get a physical. A few days later, the doctor saw Morris walking down the street with a gorgeous young woman on his arm. A couple of days later, the doctor spoke to Morris and said, 'You're really doing great, aren't you?' Morris replied, 'Just doing what you said, Doc: 'Get a hot mamma and be cheerful.'' The doctor said, 'I didn't say that. I said, 'You've got a heart murmur; be careful.'         One more. . .!         A little old man shuffled slowly into an ice cream parlor and pulled himself slowly, painfully, up onto a stool.. After catching his breath, he ordered a banana split. The waitress asked kindly, 'Crushed nuts?' 'No,' he replied,   'Arthritis.'
20090307032931AAtICtK	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	R We gettin Old!? Rate 1 to 10?	The boss walked into the office one morning not knowing his zipper was down and his fly area wide open. His assistant walked up to him and said, 'This morning when you left your house, did you close your garage door?' The boss told her he knew he'd closed the garage door, and walked into his office puzzled by the question.      As he finished his paperwork, he suddenly noticed his fly was open, and zipped it up. He then understood his assistant's question about his 'garage door.' He headed out for a cup of coffee and paused by her desk to ask, 'When my garage door was open, did you see my Hummer parked in there?' She smiled and said, 'No, I didn't. All I saw was an old mini van with two flat tires.'      An elderly gentleman... Had serious hearing problems for a number of years. He went to the doctor and the doctor was able to have him fitted for a set of hearing aids that allowed the gentleman to hear 100% The elderly gentleman went back in a month to the doctor and the doctor said, 'Your hearing is perfect. Your family must be really pleased that you can hear again..' The gentleman replied, 'Oh, I haven't told my family yet. I just sit around and listen to the conversations. I've changed my will three times!'      Two elderly gentlemen from a retirement center were sitting on a    bench under a tree when one turns to the other and says: 'Slim, I'm 83 years old now and I'm just full of aches and pains. I know you're about my age.. How do you feel?' Slim says, 'I feel just like a newborn baby.' 'Really!? Like a newborn baby!?' 'Yep. No hair, no teeth, and I think I just wet my pants.'      An elderly couple had dinner at another couple's house, and after eating, the wives left the table and went into the kitchen. The two gentlemen were talking, and one said, 'Last night we went out to a new restaurant and it was really great. I would recommend it very highly..' The other man said, 'What is the name of the restaurant?' The first man thought and thought and finally said, 'What is the name of that flower you give to someone you love? You know... The one that's red and has thorns.' 'Do you mean a rose?' 'Yes, that's the one,' replied the man. He then turned towards the kitchen and yelled, 'Rose, what's the name of that restaurant we went to last night?'      Hospital regulations require a wheel chair for patients being discharged.   However, while working as a student nurse, I found one elderly gentleman already dressed and sitting on the bed with a suitcase at his feet, who insisted he didn't need my help to leave the hospital. After a chat about rules being rules, he reluctantly let me wheel him to the elevator. On the way down I asked him if his wife was meeting him. 'I don't know,' he said. 'She's still upstairs in the bathroom changing out of her hospital gown.'      Couple in their nineties are both having problems remembering things. During a checkup, the doctor tells them that they're physically okay, but they might want to start writing things down to help them remember   Later that night, while watching TV, the old man gets up from his chair.   'Want anything while I'm in the kitchen?' he asks. 'Will you get me a bowl of ice cream?' 'Sure.' 'Don't you think you should write it down so you can remember it?' she asks. 'No, I can remember it.' 'Well, I'd like some strawberries on top, too. Maybe you should write it down, so's not to forget it?' He says, 'I can remember that. You want a bowl of ice cream with strawberries. ' 'I'd also like whipped cream. I'm certain you'll forget that, write it down?' she asks. Irritated, he says, 'I don't need to write it down, I can remember it! Ice cream with strawberries and whipped cream - I got it, for goodness sake!' Then he toddles into the kitchen. After about 20 minutes, The old man returns from the kitchen and hands his wife a plate of bacon and eggs. She stares at the plate for a moment. 'Where's my toast?'      A senior citizen said to his eighty-year old buddy: 'So I hear you're getting married?' 'Yep!' 'Do I know her?' 'Nope!' 'This woman, is she good looking?' 'Not really.' 'Is she a good cook?' 'Naw, she can't cook too well.' 'Does she have lots of money?' 'Nope! Poor as a church mouse.' 'Well, then, is she good in bed?' 'I don't know.' 'Why in the world do you want to marry her then?' 'Because she can still drive!'

20090307032955AAK8li9	Entertainment & Music;Horoscopes	What does this mean when a Gemini does this ?	I'm a Pisces guy ( with a Gemini Moon ).  I had several chance meetings with this Gemini guy. We met, we got introduced to one another. Nothing else.       Then after not meeting him for awhile, I met him again after his mother's death. He was the one who approached me first in this instance. We talked, and after stumbling onto his email address, decided to drop him a message. He responded, and later in one of his emails, he gave me his handphone number.       But it was touch and go. But I knew he was interested because he had asked someone some personal questions about me.       Then the emails just dried up. No calls either. It seemed he had just disappeared from the face of the earth. Apart from an email or two, I stopped trying.       Then his father passed away about a year and a half later. Suddenly he reappeared, apologizing for being absent. I decided to give it one more chance, and I did not make a hoo-haa about his disappearing act ( which I think he appreciated ).       To cut a long story short, he had visited me several more times at my place of work after that, and had once chased after me, putting his arms around my shoulder.        He is now more communicative. He mostly responds to my sms, and recently just dropped in at my place of work for a surprise visit.       From where I'm standing, it seems that he has genuinely changed but I'm still not sure.       The question I want to ask, especially Geminis - what does this mean ?

20090307043123AAHHAd5	Entertainment & Music;Comics & Animation	Heavy Duty Evangelion Question: Ikari Gendo?	OK, as all of us know, Evangelion is a very complex anime, perhaps the most complex of all times. Anyway, I have always wondered about Gendo's character. We have to start with the given that Yui was the only person Gendo ever loved...and that Ayanami Rei was a combination of a clone of Yui and the daughter they spoke about, but never had. It was also very apparent that Gendo was a very sexualized character, as evidenced by his affairs with Akagi Ritsuko and her mother, Akagi Naomo. So.....      My questions are:      1. Is it likely that Ayanami Rei and Gendo had an ongoing affair, as often alluded to by Asuka's constant taunts...and the plot arc itself?      2. If so, would that be construed as an incestuous affair, or merely a replacement for his love for Yui? (Remember, there ware also several allusions to Rei and Shinji being coupled sexually, which would also have been incest...Anno was definitely not above this plot line.)      Help.

20090307041355AA0zN40	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	Problem solved, but girls watch what your kissinng, not just the blokes!?	Problem Solved!   An upper-class all girls High School in Melbourne, was faced with rather a unique problem. A number of girls were beginning to use lipstick and would put it on in the bathroom of their second floor dormitory.   That was fine, but after they put on their lipstick they would press their lips to the mirror leaving dozens of little lip prints.   Finally the principal decided that something had to be done. She called all the girls from that dormitory to the bathroom and met them there with the maintenance man.    She explained that all these lip prints were causing a major problem for the custodian who had to clean the mirrors every night. To demonstrate how difficult it was to clean the mirrors, she asked the fellow to clean one of the mirrors.   He took out a squeeze-handled, disposable-foam mop, dipped it into the toilet and then cleaned the mirror.   Since then there have been no lip prints on the mirror.

But he asked me questions about my friend who was working at the restaurant we ate at.     I thought it was kinda rude he wanted to use his phone.. is this just how Pisces is?

A couple of days ago I was stopped at a red light when I heard 'Lips of an Angel' playing. I turned my radio down and opened my window, hoping to hear the rest of the song, thinkin that it was playing in a nearby car. (I love the song, clearly)       Sadly, the song ended. A minute later my phone alerted that I had a new voice mail. I had switched my ringtone to Lips of An Angel the night before.
20090306233331AAowfcb	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Does one's avatar impact how you receive that person's tone?	Sometimes…I can sense a tone from the text someone puts out for an answer…but sometimes no tone is really given. The avatar will at times give me an idea about who this person is…whether he/she is serious, childish, old, young, and so on. And also will sometimes give me some sort of idea on tone..      Or does one’s avatar have no impact on how you perceive the answer they’re giving you?      Personally, it doesn’t affect me much at all. But I do enjoy looking at some of the fun ones. It always throws me for a while when people I know change their avies, so I have learned to pay attention to the user names when I read posts.      I don’t think I’d recognize tonedef without some type of titmouse.      ?

20090307020128AAaBsKl	Entertainment & Music;Movies	What is the OLD Grimm's brother film called? NOT the 62 or 05 version.?	There is an OLD movie I remember watching as a kid and just loving. I BELIEVE it's about the Grimm brothers (it is NOT the 1960s or Heath Ledger films!!!).   I think the movie was made in the 70s or 80s. Two brothers some how travel to see Cinderella and help Prince Charming find her, but one of the brothers finds himself wanting Cinderella for himself.   The OTHER brother meets the 12 dancing princesses and something similar happens. Another thing I remember from it is a Sleeping Beauty sort of scene, and that there are kings and queens wearing white, red and black (if my memory serves me correctly). There is a lot of dancing and a BIT of singing. Also, there is one freaky evil witch.   The movie is NOT "Brother's Grimm" made in 2005 and is NOT the 1962 version that's over 100 minutes long.   Does ANYONE know what this movie is called? And if so, does anyone know where I can either watch it or buy it?   Thanks if you can help me!

If there was no tomorrow wouldn't you want to tell everyone how much you love them and let them know how much they mean to you? Or if there was anyone that you have hurt or anyone who has hurt you wouldn't you want to make it right? True happiness doesn't come over time, it is learned and earned. I just had to say something because I have herd so many people say it and they really don't mean it. So please if not for me for you... go tell everyone who has ever meant anything to you that you love them. Right the wrongs and Forgive and forget. Then you can say That you are living like there is no tomorrow.         Let me know your opinion...tell me you definition...

20090307052016AAwqqHT	Entertainment & Music;Music;Classical	People without perfect pitch, how do you hear intervals?	(I thought that this might make a nice change from "how do I get perfect pitch?" questions.)   Anyway. I have perfect pitch. One of the issues that it caused (due in part to it also coming with a tendency to perceive music very atomistically (which is a matter for another question)) was in learning to recognise intervals. Take, for example, a major third. I had to know all the combinations of notes (NOTES, not pitch classes) over quite a large range that were a major third apart, and find the common characteristics between them (they all sound markedly different to me) to get the idea of the "major third" sound. I had to do this with all intervals. Thankfully, I'm a very quick learner, especially when it comes to music.      Now, the question: people *without* perfect pitch, does each interval, to you, have a particular sound that doesn't change even when the notes making up the interval do? For example, does C- E sound basically the same as D-F#?

20090307035524AAD8uKz	Entertainment & Music;Music;Classical	Are we missing a lot of the subtleties of great works by not dividing strings?	For quite some time , orchestras in both concerts and recordings, have been laid out violins to the left, cellos to the right BUT most composers wrote for the 1st and 2nd violins to be divided to the Left and right of the conductor.      this is particularly noticeable in such works as Tchaikovsky 6, 4th mov.   where the 1sts and 2nds state the theme note for note antiphonally.      Is there any hope that enlightened conductors can revert to the former conventional layout of the orchestra?

20090307030757AAZGe6n	Entertainment & Music;Horoscopes	Would an HONEST Capricorn guy ...?	and i really do mean a good hearted HONEST Capricorn guy -   Would he not tell a girl the truth that he had no interest in her because he was worried about hurting her feelings? even if the girl was doing everything to show how much she cared and liked him and was supporting him through all his difficult times would he let her carry on knowing there was no hope because he didn't want to hurt her?

20090227132030AAmEBeL	Entertainment & Music;Comics & Animation	Do you think Ashely Greene (alice) from twilight should be thinner?.?	(I AM NOT SAYING SHE IS FAT)Ok, so i am a twilight fan and personally think that all the characters were well chosen. And please do not attack me, i am in no way saying that Ashley Greene (Alice) is fat, she is slim.But in the book decriptions she is decribed as very short, and small, and 'thin in the extremes'. I think her facial features are perfect for the role, and in Twilight she fitted the character role, but from seeing recent pictures i dont know if she will pull it off for new moon. I know they can't make it exactly perfect, but body wise i can't see Ashley Greene as Alice. And please don't go on about how people in hollywood, actesses are either 'too thin or too fat', i'm not saying that, i think she is beautiful but for the film role i think she should lose a bit of the weight so she can fit Alice's character. After all, Alice is supposed to be very tiny,and 'extremely thin'.I think she is slim, but not as tiny as Alice is decribed. What do you guys think? (Look at these recent pics and make up ur mind)       http://www.ashleygreene.net/gallery/disp...        http://www.ashleygreene.net/gallery/disp...

20090307043020AAr12cs	Entertainment & Music;Movies	Was making Watchmen into a movie a good idea?	While the novel itself is a great work by itself, turning into a movie requires millions of dollars, against the idea that most people won't 'get' postmodern deconstruction, especially something disguised as a popcorn superhero flick. Even the Mature ratings doesn't limit itself to most people who have never read the original novel or even read books at all.      In the end, many are left disappointed and bewildered. And people hate anything they can't understand. The studios may also lose money due to negative reviews.      This is opposed to a low budget art film, where the audience consists of people who seek out the art. Not people who have watched 300 and go to films for their main source entertainment.

I've seen all episodes of buffy about a thousand times and i just noticed something. in chosen, the very last episode of buffy the vampire slayer, when angel hands buffy the locket, she kind of puts her hand over his while taking it, and they seem to feel something. when she hands it to spike later, she kinda drops it in his hand without actually TOUCHING his hand. now i know she said she loved spike at the end and sent angel away, but does anyone else think that this simple gesture kind of indicates that she still had very strong feelings for angel, more specifically that her feelings for him were stronger than her feelings for spike?

20090227132230AA0efnE	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rock and Pop	The English invented Rock and Roll. Did Americans help found rock in any way?	Americans like to take credit for inventing everything- Like cars, (invented in Germany), basketball (invented in Canada), baseball (invented in England) and Rock and roll (invented in England)      England produced the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, The who, Led Zeppelin, the Yardbirds, The kinks, Pink Floyd, etc.      Who did the Americans have? The Monkeys. Britanny Spears.      Honestly, I don't think Americans contributed anything to rock, except for Nirvana nad Pearl Jam.      How can Americans claim they invented rock and roll? I don't think they had any significant contribution to rock at all.   Before England gave the world the Beatles, all the US had was Pat Boone.

The guy then say that he probably lost them on his way to the bar.   The bartender then asks how he lost them.   The guy then says that he one moment was peeing in a corner and that he the next moment was being chased by some kind of gang.   The bartender then asks how he managed to run away from the gang.   - Well  I was being chased for no reason so I came to my senses and stopped and ran towards them to ask them why they were chasing me.   - Turns out they didn't chase me they were running away like I did.   The bartender then asks what they were running away from.   - Apparently they had released animals that had been kept in captivity.   The bartender then asks the guy why he has a hood over his head.   The guy takes off the hood.   - Well as you can see, i'm a talking chimpanzee. Do you serve beer here?   - Yes we do, are you sure you don't want a banana drink instead?   - Nah, I don't like the banana flavor.   - Haha, a monkey who does not like the banana flavor what's next a talking monkey?   The chimpanzee then looks at the bartender with a face like "you got me" and says,   - Okay, i'll take a banana drink, but no damn ice!

20090307051950AA1Xxeb	Entertainment & Music;Horoscopes	In reference to natives with a Sun-Moon conjunction (aka born under a New Moon)?	I've been thinking about this for a long time and now it seems like I just can't find the right answer. :-/      When the Sun conjuncts the Moon in a natal chart, the particular natives are said to be defined by a harmonic interaction between their conscious and subconscious self, as their hard-core identity (Sun) is in sync with their emotional world (Moon).      However, when the Sun and Moon are conjunct, that also means the Moon is (most probably) combust...or in other words, "burnt" by the Sun.       So, doesn't that mean that their subconscious self is in fact "destroyed" by their Sun and not in any sense "merged" with it (like any average conjunction reveals)?      And if that is true, isn't it possible that the native's mother's behaviour  was in fact NOT in harmony with the one of their father's, but rather restricted and eventually extinguished by him (at least in the native's mind)?

I read Mel Slade ( Theo Walcott's girlfriend ) was going to have a part in Harry Potter + The Deathly Hallows. She plays a pal of Hermione as they watch a game of Quidditch.      According to:  http://www.mirror.co.uk/celebs/news/2009...       Hermione only hangs around with Harry + Ron, plus there is no quidditch in this movie? Plus they're travelling most of the time, so they're wouldn't haven't been time to be watching quidditch.      I've read the books loads of time and i definitely don't remember this. Maybe the 7th film wouldn't have to be in two if they didn't add extra scenes!      Correct me if i'm wrong! I don't know where this is in the book!

Tomorrow I fly out to Austria and Innsbruck Kranebitten. However I have a period of about 6 hours where I'll be able to explore the city- but as I am going onto Italy later on in the day, I'll have my bag with me.    Obviously this is just a hinderence to have to carry a bag full of a weeks worth of clothes and it would be sad to miss the opportunity to explore Innsbruck.   also, my transfer is a little complicated!   I will be picked up by minibus from the airport at about 5, however it has been organised on behalf of my girlfriend (who I am visiting) and the organisation she works for. I haven't actually booked transfers, I'm just an 'unofficial add-on' essentially. Therefore I must keep hold of my luggage.         Any suggestions/ideas?
20090307070204AACJq0Q	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	Would this be a cute joke to tell my cousin who is a pastor?	A single guy decided life would be more fun if he had a pet. So he went to the pet store and told the owner that he wanted to buy an unusual pet. After some discussion, he finally bought a talking centipede, (100-legged bug), which came in a little white box to use for his house.             He took the box back home, found a good spot for the box, and decided he would start off by taking his new pet to church with him.              So he asked the centipede in the box, "Would you like to go to church with me today? We will have a good time."  But there was no answer from his new pet.               This bothered him a bit, but he waited a few minutes and then asked again, "How about going to church with me and receive blessings?"                    But again, there was no answer from his new friend and pet . So he waited a few minutes more, thinking about the situation.                The guy decided to invite the centipede one last time.  This time he put his face up against the centipede's house and shouted, "Hey, in there! Would you like to go to church with me and learn about God?"               ........................YOU ARE GOING TO LOVE THIS...               This time, a little voice came out of the box:  "I heard you the first time! I'm putting on my shoes.."

He did watch 300 (in small pieces at a time), but we didn't let him see   the "sex" parts. He understood about the Spartans fighting naked, and their general lifestyle.   However, the themes in this one are a little heavy...He did not really like the Dark Knight, for instance, where the line between the good guy and bad guys gets blurry.   Thanks for your input!

20090307052222AAnWUuM	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	Newspapers..... JOke?	Indian News Papers reported the following headings in today’s News papers:            Hindu:                     “Terrorists attack Sri Lankan Cricket team in Lahore”       ToI:                        “Neighborhood Just Got Scarier”       Indian Express:         “Terror Hits Lanka Team; Wounds Pakistan & Cricket”       Deccan Herald:         “Six Sri Lankan Cricketers hurt in Lahore terror attack”               Their counter parts across the border ran the following news articles on their front pages:               Pakistan Express:     “Falling standards in Terrorists Training???”               Lahore 03 March 2009: In the worst ever performance by their home grown and trained terrorists, all the visiting Sri Lankan cricket team members left Pakistan shore alive. Govt officials expressed concerns about this as it would tarnish the image of Pakistan as a breeding ground of terrorism and their credibility to produce world class terrorists has taken a beating. Govt asked the PSU (Public Sector Units) terrorists groups to improve the training standards and urged the terrorists to take their training and careers seriously.               Prime Minister later during dinner with the participating terrorists chided them mildly that they cannot waste tax payers/US federal Aid money like this. He was particularly harsh on the terrorist who threw under the bus (carrying cricketers), the grenade which did not detonate. Prime Minister worried that this did not do any good to his plans of changing Pakistan National game from Cricket (which anyway is having its natural death) to Hand Grenade Throwing. He felt that this was the best bet for Pakistan’s aspiration for an Olympic Gold Medal. He urged erstwhile Pakistan cricket bowlers – Shoaib Akhtar and others, who are famous for throwing instead of bowling, to take up coaching terrorists on grenade throwing as their cricket careers are finished now….                       Pakistan Killer Times:   “Chinese imports are no longer reliable??”               Pakistan Government ordered a high level delegation consisting of all ammunition experts under the leadership of A Q Khan (father of the Nuclear Plans), to study the unexploded grenade for the reasons why it did not perform expected duties. The hand grenade clearly had visible ‘Made in China’ logo on it, which embarrassed Chinese Government. Chinese Premier issued a public apology to Pakistan People for failing to live up to their expectations and vowed to strengthen their R&D and manufacturing facilities to re-instill the confidence in consumers.               Pakistan Prime Minister in a later press release mentioned that he would re-consider renewing Chinese contract for annual supply of ammunition, which is due for renewal in April. Unless China proves that they have taken stringent measures to ensure that the reliability of their ammunition is certified by their government, Pakistan would consider approaching other sources for their annual staple supply of ammunition…                       Dawn:                        “Visiting Sri Lankan cricketers return to their country, Alive:(”               There was all round disappointment reported across Pakistan that all the members of the visiting Sri Lankan cricket team returned alive, denting the image of Pakistan as most the happening country in the world (for wrong reasons). People staged protests on streets and demanded government for the “falling return on Investment of ammunition.” They are also worried that this would set a bad precedence and foreigners may choose to visit Pakistan without any fears.               The betting racket reportedly lost a billion Pakistan Rupees as everyone expected all the visiting team members to be killed. This also had tax collection implications for government.               Government later issued a public apology to people and assured them that they would take sufficient measures to ensure that they are accountable for every Pakistan rupee being spent on training terrorists. They also urged more youngsters to take to guns as this would make the career as terrorists much more competitive and Pakistan can continue producing abundant supply of world class terrorists.               When the initial news of attack was shown live on their national news channels, all the people came to street and started bursting crackers. Their joy was short lived when the attack stopped in 25 minutes and they took the crackers back to their homes so that they can use it for next opportunity, which anyway should not be too far away.               Some of those Pakistanis who still have a job and left for offices in the morning and hence missed the ‘Live action’ on TVs, rued their luck for having to work while majority of their brethren enjoy these live actions on TV idling at homes. The working class in Pakistan demanded that henceforth they be informed before hand about terrorists attacks so that they can stay back home and enjoy the live action on TV. Government assured them that they will publish “Annual Terrorism Ca

Just what you do to me.   You give me butterflies   at all the worst times.   But, through all of that   I love you all over again.      [Chorus]   I don't wanna fall for you   so so hard.   But I feel that heartbreak comin on.   I know its true.   I don't want to believe that your   your love is like the wind.   I can feel it somewhere   but its gone too soon   and I swear   your love's like the wind.      I bet you'd treat me right.   Say you love me every night.   And I'd cherish every second of it.   But, I know inside   my emotions, I must hide.   And I wish I could tell you   just what you do to me.   Your practically killin me.   But, baby,   It kills me   cause I could do you better than her.   And I know I never will because...      [Chorus]   I dont want to fall for you   so so hard.   But I feel that heartbreak comin on.   I know its true   What else can I do?   Your love is like the wind.   I ca feel it deep inside.   Sweeping across my broken face   and I know that after this...   I'll never be the same.      I've felt heartbreak.   More than once.   And, all my scars are just healin up.   And now you gotta come back.   And tear me up inside.   But, my emotions,   I must hide.   Because...      Your love was like the wind.   It was barely there.   No one could see it   But I swear,   that every once in awhile   you feel it rush back   like a raging heart attack.   But baby oh...   the wind is dying.   And its moved on.   I guess its time...   for a brand new song...

I had "music" class for nine years (with a guy named Mr. Bach, no less) and never once did we learn how to read notes. The only thing I got out of that class was that "they tried to tar and feather the music man!" Now, though, I'm trying to teach myself how to play the piano since I don't really have time for formal lessons or anything (so please don't tell me that I need to get a teacher. I would love to, but that's not really an option right now.)      My question is: when you're reading the notes on a piece of sheet music for the piano, how can you tell something that is played on a black key from a note that's played on a white key? Do they have a sharp sign (#) next to it or...? I'm so confused and I feel like such an idiot.       Thanks!

I realize that they stopped translating for whoever knows what reason but I saw someone translate chapter 36 and posted it on the forums. They didn't translate the actual manga and changed it but posted who said what for each page. I was just wondering if there is a site of people who do that. I don't mind reading words on a forum and looking at the japanese manga but sadly i can't find either. Hope someone could help me out. Thanks

By 13 it was time for me to get a new sax, i got a beautiful brand new alto sax who i fell in love with when i brought him for ￡400. All through high school my saxophone was an outlet for all my frustrations. I hated school but i could chill out with my sax at night and play till my heart was content. In 2008 i started A levels, and i haven't picked up my sax since. Half of me really wants to get a score out and play but the other half really can't be bothered so my sax has sat un-played for over six months ... Shall i just sell it ?
20090307072357AAOpUVh	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	Am I Going to Regret Going Back?	Last week I went over to a girl I like's dorm room and she wasn't there. I guess I was kind of rude to her roommate and 4 friends. They had a lot of fun at my expense. They grabbed me and forced a dress over my head, tied me up with a pair of panythose and a bathrobe sash and they gave me a makeover and painted my nails. They took a ton of pictures. They've offered to destroy the pictures if I go over this weekend and model some clothes and cooperate completely. I was told I'd have to come alone and be extremely agreeable. I really want to destroy those pictures before any of my friends see them. Should I go over this weekend and agree in exchange for the pics they took? I think they plan to take more pics, but at least they wouldn't be as embarrassing. Is this a trap?

20090307073838AA9J4Sp	Entertainment & Music;Movies	What'd You Think Of Watchmen?	I saw it last night and I must say that it left quite an impression on me. I was truly amazed at how much it followed the novel's outline. I thought the music was absolutely genious and opening scene was like a fanboy's dream!       I had two major problems with the film, neither of which kept it from being a great film...      1. The omission of "Tales of the Black Freighter". I completely understand that some things had to be cut from the film and this was the obvious thing to cut out (I plan on buying the cartoon dvd), but I  feel that the aspect of comic within a comic added a whole different element of foreshadowing to the novel.      2. The initially portrayal of Oxymandis. I must say that I didn't particularly like how Oxy was made out to be a bit sinister at the very begginning of the film. My friend who I saw the film with, who has never read the novel, leaned over and asked me, "So he's the bad guy right?" As I remember in the novel, Oxy is portrayed with a pretty big ego, but also as a definite people person (remember how he would protect his fellow heros from being made into toys and hwo he would always ask about people's families within his letters?). I feel that if he would have been portrayed in a lighter sense, the ending would have been much more suspenseful.         Other than that, I thought the film was great. Any changes that were made only made the film better in my opinion. The obvious CHANGE was the ending, but the whole giant squid thing blew my mind in the novel, so I can only imagine the confusion it would cause viewers who have never read the novel before.         In terms of films based on comics or graphic novels, I think that this rates pretty high. Off the top of my head the only ones I would put above it would be       1. Batman Begins   2. The Dark Knight   3. History of Violence   4. Persepolis   5. Batman (1989) (Watchmen is a better film than this, but because of personal sentiments, I have to rate "Batman" higher).       But I definately like this more than anything Marvel has put out, more than any of the Superman films and any of the other Alan Moore films.      So what are your opinions?
