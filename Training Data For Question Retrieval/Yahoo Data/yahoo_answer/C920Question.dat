I lost my income and have been paying my mortgage through my savings which are about to run out. I have a new job I will be starting but not enough to cover my existing payment. I asked my lender to modify my loan to help out otherwise I will go into default, but they said they only help after I have already been late on 2 payments (2 different lenders for my 1st and 2nd mort told me the same thing). Why do they reward people after they are late, forcing them to ruin their credit first? I contacted an attorney and he told me to purposely miss my next 2 payments before he can help me and that everyone is doing this. IS this the only way I can get help, to miss my payments? It seems like responsible people have to get screwed over in order to get help. My file should be in the frontline before I am FORCED to make a late payment, not in the back waiting til I make a late payment first!

I did not know I had been denied before it may of had something to do with someone trying to file income tax in my name last year but it didn't go through.They said that I need to file form 8862. I did my taxes at hr block. I only worked 3 months last year and my income totaled to $4100. So I was supposed to get back $1600. When I checked with the irs web site and phone number, it stated that my refund had been increased because of the recovery rebate and that I would get $2300. I did not file taxes last year so I didn't receieve a rebate check. I filed 2 children this year and my son is over 13 years old.I received my refund on Feb 13 minus $101 dollars that I owed the state. Now I have been receiving letters from the irs saying now I have been eic recertified and I don't have to file form 8862 in the future and that I should receive my eic refund within 6 weeks. Anyone know what this refund is and an estimate oh how much it could be? Im thinking it is a child tax credit and maybe I didn't receive all the refund that I was supposed to get. My son was filed by his father last year so he received a rebate for him. Thanks.

I have a house up for sale in a trendy downtown neighborhood that has shot up in value over the last ten years and still hasn't lost much of it's value, but in other parts of town I can now buy a house three times the size and with ridiculously better amenities.  A much more lopsided situation than just a year ago.  There are lookers so I think mine will sell.        I'm self employed and I expect a bad year.  I'm 50 single, have little debt and plenty of money in stocks that I don't want to touch at this point.      So here are my options.  I can pay cash for a house that is very basic and put half my money under a mattress.  Or I can use all my cash from the sale and buy the basic nice new two story four bedroom in a nice newer development.  Or I can get a 30 year loan for what rent on a small apartment would cost, half of what I pay currently (this includes insurance and taxes) and with my cash buy a very nice house in a very nice neighborhood.      But the local big employer just announced it is laying off 2,000 this year.  Stocks are still going down.  I really believe in six months or a year a little cash is going to buy a whole lot more house.  I believe now is the best time to sell my house, but for me to rent in the mean time will cost twice or perhaps three times my current monthly payment.      Anyone see a best game plan with an eye to the coming years.
20090307060552AAR60wd	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Other - Careers & Employment	Employment verification question?	I am wondering why many employment verification requests contain wording that releases an employer from liability, due to information they furnish about one of their employees (current or former).      I've heard so many people say that employers will only give out the bare minimum info, for legal reasons.  But, doesn't the above wording give them the go-ahead to say anything they want?       I'm asking on behalf of a family member who has been trying to obtain employment for awhile now.  He was turned down for a job b/c of the info that his former employer provided.  He asked the prospective employer for a copy of the verification and was denied... even though the form that he signed clearly stated that he was entitled to that information if turned down for employment.  They did at least verbally tell him what made them decide not to hire him. (But it would have been nice to be able to see it in writing, and also to see if there was anything else questionable.)      So, if an employer gives information that the individual feels is false or inappropriate, is there anything the individual can legally do?  I imagine if my relative were to cross out the liability release, his former employer would refuse to fill it out.      After this last experience, I am having a hard time trusting his past employer to be truthful on the verification, and it seems wrong to release them from liability if they do give false or misleading info.      Knowledgeable responses only please.  Thank you.

I have just sent off for one of these, thinking I would actually be helping advertise products for a marketing company. Instead of which, they want you to lure other poor saps into paying the ￡50 start-up fee through use of flyers. Me, I believe this is immoral. A job should be something one should be able to have pride in, serving a real and useful purpose. Me, right now I make coffee and toast for bus drivers and get up exceedingly early to do so - but the bus drivers respect me for doing them a service which means a lot to them, even if it may not signify a lot to anyone else. These mailing schemes must lower the morale of all that are involved, because they do nothing for anyone besides luring folk into deceiving other folk that there might be some real, useful work for them to do at a time when many people are finding themselves out of work. Do you find this equally disgusting as I do?

I'm in the military and I just earned Staff Sergeant (Air Force E-5 last spring).  As a result, my boss gave me a subordinate (the first new guy to join the shop).  As it turns out, my bosses assistant taught this guy in technical training school and already knew the guy was a complete dope!  I've hung out with the dude before but mostly in a supportive supervisor kind of role (like we'll talk about work stuff over a drink).        The problem is, this guy has been here since September and he is just a real idiot.  Like we are aircraft electricians right, and he has been in for over six years (I have only been in for like 5 1/2 but I am a rank above him).  He has no idea how to do any work on the airplane.  We both are pretty new to the base.  I just got here about a year ago and spent a lot of time away from actual aircraft work.  Like I said he just got here in September.  The problem is, he came to the base fully qualified to work on this plane and he is totally uncapable.  As a result, he was given a job in shop to manage our toolbox program and he keeps finding new ways to mess that up.      I am really starting to get pissed because now he is getting into trouble with other supervisors.  The other day I had to stay back an hour after my 12-hour shift to keep him from getting reprimanded because he got mad at his shift supervisor and stormed out and slammed a door (not to mention he left equipment running).  Then he went to take his physical training (PT) test (which is usually taken in the physical training uniform) wearing duty uniform pieces and PT uniform pieces.  I mean my boss almost wouldn't let him test because he wanted to run in a mechanic's pair of coveralls, a military issued thermal sweater, the Air Force PT jacket.  What really gets me is he finds a way to make everything somebody elses' fault.  I've handled him with kid gloves up to this part because he said he had suicidal thoughts once and he went to go sen a counselor on base when he first got here because he was having a hard time getting over how he was treated while he was stationed in Korea.  But what do I do?  He is gettting out of the military in August but I think he is going to get into serious trouble before then.  Anyone else ever been the boss of a total idiot?

More often than not i don't like being at my job and I think i've narrowed it down to these two personalities that just annoy me, they happen to be the two people above me in the great heirarchy of the workplace.      My team leader I swear his hero is Bill Lumburg from Office Space and my manager is just a coward who's only method of motivating his employees is sending strongly worded emails. They won't stay out of my business no matter what. Always mapping out every single specific task of my day for me. If I slack off they send emails to make sure I know they're noticing me slacking off, if I work hard they send me emails making sure I'm working hard on precisely what they want me to do. I showed up ready to work hard today then i got this long email from my manager with all my tasks for today and suddenly all i wanted to do was slack off.      Most everyone who works here is cool but these two are not and they just happen to be the two who give me all my orders. I don't want to blow up on them and tell them to leave me the F alone cause I like having a job but I feel like such a b*** just sitting here and letting them try and micromanage every single aspect of my day.

Hi, the nosie can be heard often especially at night when it is quite. I heard that too at night - cracks. It is in Canada and there was a lot of snow and still there is ice and snow on the roof although i used a roof rake to remove a lot (but admit I did not do it during the winter because as a new landlord unfortunately I didn't think about). Is it possible the house is really shifting/moving or something? (one of the tenants said that smiling/joking or something) Should I call the insurance company as soon as possible? is it possible the house is moving OR is it common to hear such noises? is it possible it is related to the snow on the roof and not the house structure or something?

This goes for every computer and individual who likes to sit on their rears all day and year long at their stupid computers and dial every number that owes them money to any other idiot in between who thinks making anonymous phone calls to a certain number.       I think in my opinion, regardless if a certain person owes money or not to a financial agency or whatever, I think every person who anonymously calls should get fired from their job.       I did tell my dad that it's no wonder the people haven't lost their jobs yet or else FBI arrests them.      Is a local police officer maybe a person I could speak to on the calling situation that maybe if I gave him/her a list of numbers that have called us that they can track them and see who's who and tell them to not call anymore or how would this work?

20090307081820AAnHcuZ	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	2009 a good time to buy a house in Atlanta?	I know that some experts are saying prices may drop a little more, however there are already TONS of deals to be made right now. I plan to stay in Atlanta for quite a while - over 5 years - so this isn't a short term deal.      If I do buy a house here in Atlanta, it won't be until the end of the year anyways b/c of two reasons: (1) I want to increase my savings.  My plan is to have a 6 month reserve in savings plus atleast a 10% downpayment.  So I'm basically looking to buy once my savings is atleast 28K (10K for 6mth reserve + *18K downpayment). (2) I recently moved - so I haven't been at my current position very long which may make it hard to get a mortgage. So waiting 7 or 8 months may help with that.      I have excellent credit (about 730).  I'm a single female with no kids. I don't require a ton of space, however I would prefer a new(er) nice 2 or 3 bedroom house - and there's a LOT of inventory in the Atlanta area! *$180,000 for a house is just a rough estimate and I know prices may be higher or lower depending on area, etc.      Thanks!!      ((PS: Do you think it would be hard to secure a mortgage with current job history of less than a year? Even with good credit and a nice income? I'm just not sure how important that weighs in this current market))

They are very close and interact with one another great. I am quite an introvert but quite ambitious. I am always looking at improving my career and taking training to move forward.   I have had problems relating to my line manager because he is really overly friendly and open with my colleague. However with me he is blunt, ignores me and quite callous. I tried to talk to him with small chat the other day by asking him things my colleague would do to start a conversation and was told to shut up. Within half an hour of this abrupt manner he was playing a daft and rather rude game with my colleague. I thought he might have had a work load piled high thus the comment to shut up so he could get on with it. Obviously this wasn't the case. I am seriously hurt by the fact he treats me differently to this colleague of mine.   I know sometimes I come across as aloof and that I am better than everyone else but deep down I am insecure and don't trust many people. I am seeking help to try and boost my self esteem and I am proud of my accomplishments.   I have had so many people let me down and used me for things from sex to my personal belongings, I try to trust people and it falls back in my face.   I just wish I could work alongside my manager better. He knows my situation and he has expressed its a weakness by the fact I am seeking therapy.   I tried to buy everyone a small offering of a cake and I found my managers in the bin uneaten.      What on earth do I do?

At the moment I go to University full time, and work as an I.T./Network technician part time.      In my Job, i cover Server 2003, AD, Backupxec, WAN links, Vista/XP, MS Office support, network diagnostics.      At Uni,  Im doing a foundation degree in Computer Technology, have already got my Comptia A+, 70-270 MCP exam and covered CCNA semesters 1 and 2.      I have the following choices open to me next year but don't know which to choose.      1)  Stay at work, and do the third year of a degree (BSc) in networking part time (which will take me two years instead of one).  The benefits of this are that I keep my job (and income), and when I leave uni (in 2011) I will have three years experience in a network support role and a networking degree.  The downside is it takes a year longer out of my life.      2) Leave work and take the third year of a BSc in networking full time,  completing it in a year.  Will have to survive on student loans, but will have a proper full time job a year earlier.      3) Leave work and take the third year of a BSc in computer technology full time, completing it in a year, and then doing a Masters in Networking the year after. (I would have to do a computer technology degree to pursue a masters in networking, because too many of the modules cross over with the networking degree)      For those in the know, which would be more important to you? A Masters in networking with a years work experience that is not current, or three years (albeit part time) experience at a small/medium business?      Many thanks in advance for any insightful replies.
20090307080038AACPEzQ	Business & Finance;Credit	Bank fraud or non authorizations?	I had some unauthorized transactions at the bank,  but well within 60 days limit and even sooner. They first took them and refunded all overdraft feels which were over $300,00! Then they reversed them. When I called the girl refunded them back and a few days later they reversed them again.      I called and they asked if I contacted the Merchant and I did and they said well if they have your pin number then there is nothing we will do? WHAT? I told them it was not authorized regardless if it was fraud or what but they did not have the authorization to be in my account. One was e-music that when you get a free subscription they get information and then you have two weeks to cancel and I did and they still continued to charge and notified again.      This is downright fraud if they take from your account without your authorization and the bank says they are not going to file these claims. I have never heard of that and am not going to let this go but do not know what to do. I mentioned the regulation form E and they blew it off. I told them they did not disclose my rights either which they have to and they disregarded that as well! I am furious at them and it is not their decision when it is my money and it was reported in a timely manner. The banker also was showing me how to pay bills online like I do not know that and then he paid my electric bill which was fine but he wanted to do my cable and I said no. Then when I did go in I specifically wrote down Time Warner Cable and then it showed two payments to the electric company. I told him and asked how do I remove the two electric bills and  he said I could not and we called the electric and it went there. I know I paid the Cable company!. When I got home it was removed!! They even removed the other electric bill and the duplicate and told me I could not remove it. That is wrong! They also pay the debits by the largest to the smallest so they can charge more in overdraft fees rather than paying the largest and save you the money? Snakes!!
20090227135231AAVTMIz	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Other - Careers & Employment	Did my interview go well?	I had an interview for a job and I haven't had one in over 2.5 yrs. I am still employed but this job would really be great for me.      A mentor of mine hired the potential boss and she wrote back that she was contacting me. It took her a couple of days to do this, but her asst. called and emailed me and I went into the interview two days later (yesterday).      I met with 4 people and spent about 2 hours there. The head person (the woman) had a conference call and so I was only able to meet her for 20 minutes. She said she liked my resume b/c she likes the way my current boss thinks/invests. She had considered poaching from my group she said. She liked that I would be able to do the job immediately because there was no time for developing people as it would be a small team. She also said we had the same value system as far as investments.      The guy who I would work the most with (sr) seemed to like me a lot. The job requires a real estate and energy background and he is in his mid-40s and only has worked in real estate. I have an energy background and could immediately start helping him. He also told me that as I check them out I should make sure I'm comfortable with some things about the company.      By the time I met 4 people, the head lady still had not freed up from her conference call (it was unexpected but important). So her asst walked me out and said she would call me. My gut feeling was positive when I was leaving. I sent out thank you emails yesterday to emphasize my interest and my experience.      How do you think this went?

I recently created a production company so nobody can copy my YouTube videos. But now that my videos are getting more popular, I was wondering if I should make my own website, with stuff on it like blogs, videos, reviews, etc. Does anyone know how to make your own website? And can you use a prepaid Visa gift card from a store like Rite Aid (because I don't have a credit card) to fund it? Thanks, any suggestions would be great :)   -Nick

I was laid off in december 2008 by my parents business and have been collecting unemployment since then. My parents took a business trip to China for 15 days, leaving me to take care of my two younger brothers until they get back (I agreed to this). Meanwhile, they left me no money, so I have been paying all of our expenses myself (It totals less than $300.  Will receiving reimbursements for these expenses affect my unemployment?  They are paying me back my own money after all, but I'm not sure if I will have to report this if they give me a check.  Also, they are likely to pay me this with a check by the business (the one I was laid off from) because they are the owners. Will this look bad? Will the unemployment office know that I received a check from my old "employer" and think I am still working?        Any advise?   Thank you!

20090307082249AAAdLEj	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Health Care	My job crisis.....PLEASE ANYONE HELP ME!!?	on Thursday Feb. 26th I went to work on my usual 8 hour shift..(I am a certified nurse assistant working in a long term care facility)....the shift went as normal until the last three hours...after 6 pm I asked my immediate supervisor to take a ten minute break...my supervisor asked me to lay some of my residents down for bed before I took my break because, they were all cluttered in the front of the nurses station, I proceeded to lay some of my residents down, when I had returned I asked my superior again for a break, she immediately got angry and told me no....so then I walked away from the situation agitated. I went to go lay down the rest of my few residents down and finish my 2nd round on my few last residents. Well in the process of the one of my residents got mad and punched me in the chin after I tried to put her mobility alarm back on her…I figured after that I really needed my break so after I was done at 7pm I proceeded to ask my superior for my ten minute break...she then said no and told me she was calling the administrator. I then went to chart my adl's and went to the bathroom when I had came back out of the bathroom, my supervisor was talking on the phone to the administrator, I didn't think it was going to be as serious as I thought it would be indeed it was. My immediate superior told me that I was suspended and that I needed to go home. The next day Fri. 27th the administrator of the facility called me and asked me what happened and I told him, he then told me that he would call me back. I knew that, that weekend he wasn't going to be at work cause the office is closed, so he didn't call me until that Monday only to ask the same thing and to say that he would call me back. The following day on Tues. the 3rd of march he called and  said that after their investigation the had came to the terms that they were going to ultimately terminate me for abandoning my residents…which as I stated above had nothing to do with that if I was told to go home how am I abandoning my residents….please if anyone can help I greatly appreciate it….I’ve never been through anything under these measures….your answers are appreciated

We have talked to his brother about it and everyone involved thinks it would be a great idea. So here is the question...they pay $900 a month to rent their house and I am just wanting an opinion on what a proper split would be. At first I thought an even 3 way split but then I got thinking about it and there are only 2 bedrooms, on of which my boyfriend and I will be sharing, and the other for his brother. I have gotten some advice that says for this reason (me not having my own room) it shouldn't be equally 3 ways. Of course I plan on splitting everything else 3 ways but I'm just not sure about this. Any suggestion would be appreciated!

I bought an existing cafe about 10 months ago and signed a 5 year lease with the owner of the office building that i am in.  I was in business for about 4 or 5 months before i realized that i never received my business license.  I never received a notice saying that my application was denied.  About 2 weeks ago, we got a call from the city that said they won't approve our business license application until some improvements are made in the building to comply with the state fire marshal and alarm systems.  Then they told us that the owner never should have leased us the space because according to the city, the space that we are in is zoned only as office space, not restaurant or retail space.  There has been a cafe in that building for at least 20 years before us and they were able to get business licenses.  But the important question i have is what are our rights regarding our lease?  We want to stay in our space.  We have built up the business and would hate to leave it.  We have a meeting on Monday at 10:30AM and just found out about this meeting at 5:30pm on friday, so we didn't have time to contact a lawyer about this matter and would like to go into this meeting with some knowledge so they don't try to talk us into something that isn't good for us.

My boyfriend sends in a personal check every month.  If I pay for the gas bill this month, are they going to get all fussy because it's paid by a check with MY name on it instead of his?  The gas is in his name.  How does that work? Can I just send it in with my own check or will they only accept HIS personal checks since it's in his name?

20090307094253AArnTDd	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	Question for someone with house-buying and legal experiance...?	My husband and I just bought our first house about 2 weeks ago. Today we were doing some yard work and our neighbor wandered over to meet us. He told us that our septic tank needs to be completely replaced and relocated on the property. He's lived there for around 30 years and said that it starts to smell "sewagy" by his driveway when it is starting to overflow and needs replacing.      Apparently, when the realtor that sold us the house (it was a foreclosure) came over to check out the house and put up the for sale sign, he told her that the tank needed replacing so the buyers would be informed.      She failed to tell us that at all, just stating that they had no official records of the septic tank at all. Isn't she legally bound to have to disclose any information about the house? Is so, is there anything we can do? We just moved in 2 weeks ago and are VERY tight on money and can't afford the 6 grand it would take to clear the feild and put in a new tank.      Any words of advice?

I have a 12 month tenancy agreement with my landlord.It has a start and end date. There is an 'individually negotiated clause' which says that "Land lord or tenant shall have right to terminate tenancy by giving two months notice in writing to expire on or after 12 months from the commencement date."    The agent wants me to give 2 months notice (which means he wants me to stay on for another month) whereas I have only one month left till end of tenancy dtae, and I want to vacate on that date. I feel I am right as it is a fixed term tenancy, and the clause mentioned above was meant for a 6 month half way termination by either party.   Can any one help with some good advice. I gave them one month's notice, but agent is refusing to accept.Thanks.

I'm working as a delivery/stock man, for long, hard hours, from 8 am to at least 5 pm. It's very hard work, alot of heavy lifting and driving far distances (I don't drive, just move and physically deliver the products) sometimes even into other states for hours at a time. It's very hard work and my back is in pain and my body aches. I'm only getting paid 60 dollars a day for working from 8 am to 5 pm, and i only get paid an extra 10 if i were to work till 6 or even 7 for instance. He wants me to work at least 6 days a week, sometimes he even tries to convince to me to do 7 days, but i refuse to work a whole week cause my body needs rest. I'm didnt come in today on Saturday cause i was tired from this week and he screamed at me saying if i miss another day (on the weekend even after five days of work) he will fire me. I never agreed or volunteered to work on weekends, nor was i told it was a requirement for the job before i got it. I'm pissed and now looking for another job. I'm getting treated like an illegal immigrant and I'm american, born n raised and he is a greek immigrant. Am I getting paid less than Illinois minimum wage? I am paid in cash so there are no taxes which is good, but is it really that much better (60 dollars a day with maybe ten extra for working an extra hour or two)? There are no benefits or extra stuff that comes with the job either. How badly am I getting ripped off? Should I try and find another job, even during these economic hard times? Thanks.

My hours were being reduced somewhat and it was time to move on. My boss agreed to let me go, but my question is this: My boss said he tracked my hours over the past 2-3 weeks and said i was "padding" my hours in his opinion? My hours for the paycheck were 9 extra hours. We normally write down our hours at work on a calender, but over the past 12 months i just got lazy and did not do this. So my boss said he now is somewhat weary of my hours over this span. I want to file for unemployment benefits (which for me will not be too much anyways seeing that i havent made a large amount of money") but I do not want to run into any legal issues if this makes sense? Basically my boss is accusing me of adding hours but he said to me he does not know and he really can't go back and tell fully. I know this sounds odd but I really need to file for these benefits. When I do file the state of PA. sends my former boss a form I am assuming? And if he does accuse me of this the worst thing that happens is I am only denied benefits correct? ............. Thanks!

She was forced to stay away and listen to the call,sort of monitor it. I thought oh, I could do that job.  That starbucks location is open 24hrs and its' slogan is "embrace insomnia".  It sounds perfect for me I only work 6 hours a day, but everyday 6-7 days a week.  I like my job tho don't want to quit but need more income.  I need an extra job from home. What kinda a quick trainning can I get or get certified in the field of Information Technology that I could get a foot in the door with working from home. Currently I run/OPEN CLOSE frozen yogurt store(manager) position. PS I don't have the money to invest in BA or two year degree, can I get certified in something and get a job for an extra 300/a week,another option I was gonna do is dental assisting-maybe 3 times a week, what do you guys thing??

I already have some reserves, such as some cracks in the ceiling, and now the seller has passed the deadline for providing disclosure. This deadline was included in the contract. I'm ready to just back out, but will I lose my earnest money deposit?
