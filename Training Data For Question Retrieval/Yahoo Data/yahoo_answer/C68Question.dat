Dear Sir/ Madam,                       hello, I am writting in response to the recent happy news that at long last the Government is reviewing the outdated system of home education. Due to my own experiences of home education, I have for years been astonished and horrified that so many vunerable children are isolated in often abusive homes, and more often then not are quite literally forgotton by the communities and society which surrounds them.                                                   I was taken out of school when I was seven by my mother who suffered from a severe mental illness known as Borderline Personallity Disorder. The common symptoms of this disorder include extreme levels of physical violence, alcoholism and depression, and for seven years I alone had to deal with her episodes of extremely difficult and abusive behaviour, in an extremely isolated inviroment. As a child I also met other children who were being home educated and in more cases then not they were also suffering daily relentless abuse; be it religious, sexual, emotional or physical.        As you can imagine, I feel quite strongly about this subject and am overjoyed by the news that it is at long last to be reviewed. I would like to add that I would be happy to petition against home education, or for tighter regulations to be made for families who wish to home educate their children. Or to simply give evidence or proof in some kind in way of my own experiences, I would be more than happy to assist. Thankyou for your time and attention, yours sincerely,      Ms. Laura Goldschmit                                 Does it sound o.k? Is it a bit whiney? Would you change anything?

"All in all, do you think things in the nation are generally headed in the right direction, or do you feel that things are off on the wrong track?"      Right Direction:  41%   Wrong track:  44%       http://www.pollingreport.com/right.htm       Believe it or not, the difference between these numbers is only -3, which is a 5-year high (January, 2004 it was at +4).        The question is:  Given the horrible state of the economy that is turning out to be worse than expected (-6.2% GDP 2008 Q4, record job losses in January, huge stock market decline, bailouts, large budget deficit), where is this newfound optimism coming from?  I might expect this to increase if we've turned the corner and things were getting better, but we're not there yet.

I bought and xbox 360 from Dell's (PC company) website in January then got red rings 3 weeks later (the second time I played). I tried it again the next day and it was fine so I assumed that all would be okay (I know, foolish, right?). Anyways now I'm having problems with EVERYTHING, the xbox freezes a lot, the mic keeps cutting out and the controller switches off even with new batteries. I have taken excellent care of it so it's not my fault. On top of this I just found out that I'm moving back to the UK so I don't have time to send it to microsoft before I leave (in 2 weeks). I really don't want to sell it on ebay cause I know I'll get nothing for it cause of the problems. I called Dell and they said it was microsofts problem as I'm out of the 21 day waranty. I asked them to exchange or refund but they still said no. I'm not familiar with American laws (this wouldn't happen in UK). Are they right in saying that they can't help me??

See the link from the Wall St. Journal, below.       http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2008/12/0...       As of December 2007, no U.S. primary or caucus had been held.

Racism is not just against blacks and whites, and i hate to call people by the color of their skin. But, the stereotypes made by the people who were claiming these sings to be "racist" and what really hurts. On November 3, 2008 "Redmond wrote:      Poleezz, surprisingly they weren't hanging from pickup trucks next to the Confederate flag - and I'm not joking.      Welcome to the wasteland in between Philly and Pittsburgh.      ------------if that isn't one of the most hurtful things I've ever read, then I don't know what is. I need not mention I am from that so-called "wasteland". Please, don't twist to say it is only racism when it hurts or offends you because that is not true...I may have the palest skin you ever seen, but racism hurts me too. If i could vote(i need not mention my age either) I would have voted for someone who could be a role model, someone could help the issue of racism...not cover it up, or make it something it's not like I am afraid our dear president may do. Racism is a two way street. Obama NEVER mentions the negative effect racism has on "write people". At school students smirk at me and sometimes even spit on me because I am white...not black. And when our president mentions us in PA as clinging to our guns and religion...and whatever else i wish not to repeat...and then I read this i Truly wonder if we as a nation are taking a step forward      ---totally unedited...sorry

Bush kept the economy strong through the beginning recession handed to him from Clinton, 9/11, Katrina, 2 Wars, and Hurricane Gustav and was still able to keep our economy going and in positive growth. isnt that true????       It was the American peoples irresponsible spending and credit habits and The Fannie and Freddie Debacle that put things over the edge and why things got to the critical point of destruction.        So if Bush was able keep things a float through 4 Historic and major catastrophes our country has ever known, and that was Historic in itself. Why does the left continue to run around saying Bush did nothing?       Bush had some reckless spending habits but Obama is doing the same exact thing, if the left was helping to build the Bailout bill and were voting for and passing the bill (by a larger margin than the right). How was the bill not bi-partisan?    House:   Democrats: For 172 Against 63   Republicans: For 91 Against 108      Senate:   Democrats: For 38 Against 9   Republicans: For 33 Against 15   Independents: For 1 Against 1      Congressional Totals   Democrats For 210 Against 72   Republicans For 124 Against 133      If we were against it then and now it has become out of control why should we support it now?      Our economy is not getting better, and if we are making a Stimulus Bill to jump start the economy, and make jobs why is unemployment still falling? Where is the JUMP? Why are investors not investing? Why is consumer confidence still falling?

20090304165408AAs34Rx	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Should Internet Be Regulated?	I took this article and copied and pasted it on here from the bbc so if anybody wants to be abusive then go picket the bbc not me ok??      "A chilling fact that emerged from the Copeland case was that he discovered how to make his deadly bombs on the internet. Once again it has raised questions as to whether and how such material might be restricted. The BBC's Julie Etchingham reports.    When David Copeland planted his home made nail bomb in the Admiral Duncan in April last year he struck at the very heart of London's gay community.       To help those affected by the horrific attack, gay website Digital Diversity opened a special webpage.       Hundreds of people from all over the world visited it, many leaving messages on its online book of condolences.                Many websites provide step-by-step instructions       Yet the editor of Digital Diversity, Nigel Whitfield, says that even though Copeland got the information to concoct his nailbomb from the internet - any moves to ban such material from the web should be resisted.       "You have to accept the fact the internet is global, we don't have a global government, and its very hard unless you want to filter every bit of internet traffic in and out of the country. I don't think many people would be very happy if we did that," he says.       As part of his plans to wreak havoc in the capital, David Copeland took a trip up to London and came to an internet café in Victoria. It wouldn't have taken him very long at all to find the information he needed to make a bomb.       There are hundreds of websites providing such information, some more serious than others, and many provide foolproof step-by-step instructions.                Little can be done to regulate the Internet       What Copeland learned enabled him to wage a one-man war in the name of neo-nazism. For those who study the rise of extremism on the internet, it sets a worrying precedent.       Dr Les Back, a sociologist at Goldsmith's College says: "This case is significant because here is a person who is outside of the extreme right party organisation but subscribing to extreme racist and xenophobic views and using a profoundly democratic tool to wreak havoc and to fundamentally exercise the politics of terror."       And there's little that can be done about the bombmaking instructions Copeland got from the web.       Those who help monitor the internet in the UK say the only laws available to use online are those which already apply in the real world - such as peodophilia and questioning the government - and in this case they wouldn't help.                Roger Darlington: "We must be realistic"       Roger Darlington, the chairman of Internet Watch Foundation, says: "A lot of this information, whether we like it or not, is available and is available legally in libraries and research papers so it is going to be very difficult for us to ban it as a regulatory body.       "What we can do is appeal to responsible internet service providers and ask them whether they really feel they should be hosting this sort of material and perhaps over time its availability could be limited."       But there will always be ISPs who are prepared to carry the material - particularly in the USA where such websites are protected under the first amendment right to free speech.       But Roger Darlington says, in terms of the Copeland case, it is important to keep the issue of the role of the internet in perspective.       "We have to accept that this individual had a history and sooner or later he would have found the information to wreak violence on people and perhaps even death," says Mr Darlington.       It was made easier by the web, and we should draw some lessons from that and try to limit it, but we'll never combat it, I'm afraid, we'll never stop it completely." "      The article was written 8 yrs ago after the Bnp nail bomber David Copeland bombed areas of London popular with gays and ethnic minorities.      He got the info for bombmaking on the intenet.

20090227081828AAtFzcN	Politics & Government;Politics	Why does Obama want to rob the middle class?	Mr. Obama is of course counting on an economic recovery. And he's also assuming along with the new liberal economic consensus that taxes don't matter to growth or job creation. The truth, though, is that they do. Small- and medium-sized businesses are the nation's primary employers, and lower individual tax rates have induced thousands of them to shift from filing under the corporate tax system to the individual system, often as limited liability companies or Subchapter S corporations. The Tax Foundation calculates that merely restoring the higher, Clinton-era tax rates on the top two brackets would hit 45% to 55% of small-business income, depending on how inclusively "small business" is defined. These owners will find a way to declare less taxable income.      The bottom line is that Mr. Obama is selling the country on a 2% illusion. Unwinding the U.S. commitment in Iraq and allowing the Bush tax cuts to expire can't possibly pay for his agenda. Taxes on the not-so-rich will need to rise as well.      On that point, by the way, it's unclear why Mr. Obama thinks his climate-change scheme won't hit all Americans with higher taxes. Selling the right to emit greenhouse gases amounts to a steep new tax on most types of energy and, therefore, on all Americans who use energy. There's a reason that Charlie Rangel's Ways and Means panel, which writes tax law, is holding hearings this week on cap-and-trade regulation.      Mr. Obama is very good at portraying his agenda as nothing more than center-left pragmatism. But pragmatists don't ignore the data. And the reality is that the only way to pay for Mr. Obama's ambitions is to reach ever deeper into the pockets of the American middle class.

This is going to sound really bad, but my sister's brother in law shot himself in the head with an AK47. They seem to think that it might have been an accident. He was having a fight/argument with his wife. Apparently he always keeps a loaded AK47 on the nightstand because he was paranoid. His wife said that he was drunk and could barely stand up straight. As he reached for his ice cream he accidentally shot himself. The bullet entered through the side of face near his mouth and exited through the back of his head. He was an accident prone individual, for instance he just got a $60K settlement. He used to work for a glass company and was carrying a tabletop that had a flaw in it. The glass split and severed his bicep. As a result he lost most of the use of his arm. It really doesn't change anything for me if it was an accident, but it would make it better for immediate family. How likely was it that it was an accident. Is it really that easy to slip and shoot yourself in the head!?

Though she promised to get a job, get her GED, and participate in keeping the house, she has done little to accomplish this.  She had a seasonal job during the christmas holidays, but was let go.  The child's father recently got our of prison and was involved but they have since broken up and he is no longer a part of the equation.      The stepdaughter routinely shirks her responsibiliteis as a parent and an adult and expects her mother and I to foot the bill for her irresponsible lifestyle.  That lifestyle includes drug use, theft, lying, and generally being a worthless human being.      MY question then is:  HOw can I legally throw her and her son out of the house without being party to child neglect on the part of the son?

Each situation is different, but when I've decided to go assisted or not I'd like to die on my own terms. Although, I am not terminally ill to my knowledge at the moment there are plenty who are and I wonder why should they suffer - because we think they should live? What is "living?" Who are we to say someones life is worth or not worth living? My stance is let the person suffering decide.

He'll spend more than any budget in American history and admits to a $1.75 trillion deficit. It also creates a "Cap and Trade" system that is an ENERGY TAX on Americans. The Obama budget admits this tax will be at least $645 billion in the first 8 years alone. Prices will go up on gasoline for cars, energy to heat and cool your home. Prices will increase on just about every good you buy -- from food to consumer goods because of the higher energy costs to grow the food and make the goods.

20090306183549AAaDfc5	Politics & Government;Politics	Why would Republican "Hipster" Michael Steele give 60,000 in poltical campaign funds to a Commodities trader?	Back in 2006, Michael Steele ran for the Senate from Maryland. He lost to Ben Cardin. It appears that there may have been some funny business with how he spent campaign funds. The investigative team of one of Baltimore's television stations is reporting that the FBI is looking into whether Steele funneled money to a company owned by Steele's sister. Theoretically, the money was for campaign expenses, but her firm was involved in commodities trading. Seems a stretch. A spokesman said the money might have been used to pay for six busloads of poll workers on Election Day in 2006. The buses carried several hundred black men from Philadelphia -- many of whom were homeless -- as part of a strategy to attract black support , which to me seems to be absolutely pathetic.      What do you think? Seems to me the end is near.

Number one he is being very partisan not only with republicans but with the moderate wing of his party which I do believe will start to resist him. Number two he does not know anything about economics. When he passes the cap and trade law the economy is going to be much worse. Cap and trade is he is going to tax companies depending on how much CO2 they emitt into the atmosphere. The industries that get screwed are utilities and industrials. These two industries are some of the most important. When he passes this law they are going to get crushed and the economy will get beaten up even more.

Remember a famous person said "a government that can give you everything  is the same government that can take it away. It is time to rely on yourself and make your way dont expect someone else to pay your way damn and I am a worker and have worked all my life for what I have so dont tell me that I am hating .
20090306184026AADj6pW	Politics & Government;Civic Participation	How much should one pay to the government when God only askes for 10%?	I know all those out there who feels like that the rich ought to pay and pay and pay until the wealth is spread about equally then what happens when there is no more rich to tax or any companies to work for because the government shut them down the grocery  stores all shut down because of no food because of government controls. This happen before people ie: Russia,Germany,And amongst other places which lead to total collapse. So if you want socialism then say it loud and clear but if you want FREEDOM LIFE AND LIBERTY SO IT LOUDER  tell the government to keep the hell out of our lives. Damn I miss the days when it was smaller government and more freedom to explore yourself. If I should try and lost at least I did try then not to try at all and expect the pay. Should a brain surgeon get the same pay as a first year medical student some people thinks so

Most days i can ask just a few questions, then tell the person to shut the F- up and stop talking to me because there is no way they ever were, especially since they forced the SF thing into the convo to begin with...   i talked to a guy recently who i almost believed...mostly because of the way he handled himself, but, just as a confirmation for the next time i talk to the guy.      the green Beret is earned AFTER the completion of the full course right?   and there is nor was there ever (1980's) a program where you never had to have an MOS other than SF, that would have forced you to go to Infantry Basic and WEAR your Beret during parade inspections.   (i understand e-4 is the minimum rank you can even ASK to be placed in SF training, and usually it's e-5 by the time you GET to training).      anyway since the whole SF thing entered the convo as almost a slip up and we didn't talk about it until i prodded him on it...i wanted to make sure i had my **** straight before i embarrass him next time i talk to him...

20090306212019AAVT74W	Politics & Government;Politics	Ronald Reagan believed in the  Pillars of Freedom; do they still apply to today?	FOUR PILLARS OF FREEDOM      Individual Liberty      As President, Ronald Reagan believed that every person must be respected for his or her unique and undeniable value, and he worked to build a nation where advancement and success are based primarily on one’s individual ability and effort.      Through his program of "new federalism," President Reagan restored decision-making power to states and communities—thus granting more direct authority to American citizens—and ushering in a new era of limited government.      Economic Opportunity      Elected in 1980 as the first conservative U.S. president in over 50 years, Ronald Reagan introduced domestic policies that encouraged free market principles. His programs demonstrated that the engine of prosperity would be fueled by the empowered and not the entitled.      By the end of President Reagan’s two terms, the United States was fully engaged in the longest period of uninterrupted peacetime growth and prosperity in her history.      Global Democracy      President Reagan was a chief architect of the end of the Cold War. Under a policy he called "Peace Through Strength," President Reagan achieved his goal by building up America’s defense, reinvigorating morale within the armed services, and clearly defining the struggle against communism in terms of good and evil.      President Reagan championed a re-armed and strong military and introduced the concept of the Strategic Defense Initiative—a space-based missile defense shield—now being pursued by the Bush administration.      In 1987, President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev signed the historic treaty on Intermediate Nuclear Forces which for the first time reduced the number of weapons deployed. It was at this summit that President Reagan introduced the famous phrasing of an old Russian proverb, "trust but verify."       National Pride      After years of economic hardship and a troubling loss of American prestige around the world—including the taking of American hostages in Iran—voters swept Ronald Reagan into the presidency in 1980 in a landslide, 489 electoral votes to 49 for President Jimmy Carter.

20090306211832AA1icO1	Politics & Government;Elections	Should the Electoral College be abolished?	Should the President of the United States continue to be elected by the current Electoral College system, or should the person with the highest popular vote be declared the winner?      In your response, please consider the following:      Electing the President on the basis of a nationwide popular vote would effectively erase the state boundaries, and turn the country into a gigantic precinct.  In addition, the current electoral college system is slightly weighted in favor of the smaller states, and requires candidates to conduct nationwide campaign, and not rely solely on the states with large populations.  Abolition of the electoral college might also encourage the growth of splinter parties.      If the Electoral College system is abolished, should the winner be required to obtain a specified percentage of the popular vote (50% or more), and if no one obtains that much, should there be a runoff election between the top two vote getters?      The main argument against, as I see it, is that, on several occasions, under the current system, the person getting the most popular votes was not elected President.

I really want to be able to say that i did my part to defend freedom and earn the title of OIF or OEF veteran.

20090306200407AAJPslQ	Politics & Government;Elections	You're thoughts on these Obama jokes?	1.      What do Miley Cyrus and Barack Obama have in common? They both attract young people with mindless verses.      2.      Barrack Obama, Michelle Obama and Oprah Winfrey were flying on Obama's private plane. Obama looked at Oprah, chuckled and said, 'You know, I could throw a $1,000 bill out of the window right now and make somebody very happy.' Oprah shrugged her shoulders and replied, 'I could throw ten $100 bills out of the window and make ten people very happy. Michelle added, 'That being the case, I could throw one hundred $10 bills out of the window and make a hundred people very happy.' Hearing their exchange, the pilot rolled his eyes and said to his co-pilot, 'Such big-shots back there. ****, I could throw all of their asses out of the window and make 56 million people very happy.'      3.      A teacher asked her 6th grade class how many of them were Obama fans. Not really knowing what an Obama fan is, but wanting to be liked by the teacher, all the kids raised their hands except for little Johnny. The teacher asked Little Johnny why he has decided to be different.      Little Johnny said, 'Because I'm not an Obama fan.'      The teacher asked, 'Why aren't you an Obama fan?'      Johnny said, 'Because I'm a Republican.'      The teacher asked him why he's a Republican.      Little Johnny answered, 'Well, my Mom's a Republican and my Dad's a Republican, so I'm a Republican.'      Annoyed by this answer, the teacher asked, 'If your mom was a moron and your dad was an idiot, what would that make you?'      With a big smile, Little Johnny replied, 'That would make me an Obama fan.      4.      John McCain, Hillary Clinton, and Barack Obama all die and go to heaven. God looks down from his throne and asks McCain, “Do you think you deserve to be in heaven?”      McCain takes a breath and then replies, “Well, I think so because I was a great leader and tried to follow the words in your great book.” God looks down and then says, “You can sit to my left side.”      So, McCain takes his seat and then God asks the same question to Hillary, “Do you think you deserve to be in heaven?” Hillary thinks for a second and then replies, “I think so because I have been fighting for the rights of so many people for so long.” God again looks down and this time says, “You can sit to my right side.”      Finally God turns to Barack Obama and asks, “Do you think you deserve to be in heaven?”   Obama smiled and replied, “I think you’re in my seat.”

20090306203530AAoQcJx	Politics & Government;Government	Why is the government so persistent at getting DTV in every ones household at their own expense?	I believe that the government is trying to utilize a relatively new propaganda technique called the Silent Sound Spread Spectrum (SSSS).  The military used SSSS very successfully in Iraq during operation Desert Storm ( http://www.raven1.net/silsoun2.htm).   The government tried using it on american citizens in the past, but they were unsuccessful as the transmission is translated into static by the analog television.  The only way to properly use SSSS is through digital television, or brodcasted directly from speakers.  I was wondering if anyone else believes this to, or has some other ideas as to why the government wants DTV in every ones household.

However my dad went to the country again and he has lived there for over 6months now. I am 17 years old and I want to go visit my home country because of personal reasons. I am going to go with my greencard and stay no longer than 2 months.

I am a white guy living in South Alabama and I am also an Obama supporter but i was wondering why everyone making a big deal about his skin color. He is just as much black as he is white and as long as people continue to make distinctions about skin color, negative or positive, racism will continue. Plus if his skin was a little lighter most people against him would be for him because they are uneducated and narrow minded.      I am not asking why he was voted in office but why the racial distinction is there in the first place. whether people want to admit it or not certain people are racist. i am not asking your personal opinion but why a lot of people in general make a distinction based on skin color. The point is that as long as people base opinions, bad or good, on skin color, racial boundaries will be there.

Unfortunately, the Immigration officers in Miami where not able to conduct the interview in english.

20090227102010AA8aGlL	Politics & Government;Politics	Weren't the Nazis conservative Fascists, and not socialists?	Many people here call Obama a Nazi socialist, but the Nazi's were not socialists, they were Fascists, like Mussolini. They did not tolerate people of all races and religions. They believed in big industry and corporate wealth to bring up a nation.  They did not believe in using resources where they were needed, as in socialism, but instead used resources for financial gain, which is Fascism.      Why do people confuse Socialists with Nazis.  In fact, one of the biggest socialists of all time, Joseph Stalin, fought long and hard against Hitler and the Nazis. If Hitler was a socialist, then why not attack the west first, instead of Moscow.  If Stalin was a fellow socialist, then why not form an alliance.  He did with the Fascist Mussolini and the Italians, why not the Russians?

20090227102201AA71Ac5	Politics & Government;Politics	Why did Bush have a higher approval rating than Obama, at this point in their administrations?	The media may be smitten with President Barack Obama, but recent Gallup poll results show Americans giving the new president lower marks after one month in the White House than former President George W. Bush earned at the same point in his administration.       Heading into this week’s address to Congress, the Gallup figures showed 59 percent of Americans approved of Obama’s efforts so far, while 25 percent disapproved, and 16 percent had no opinion. According to PollingReport.com, President Bush had a 62 percent approval rating one month into his first term, with 21 percent disapproving, and 17 percent having no opinion.       “For the first time since Gallup began tracking Barack Obama’s presidential job approval rating on Jan. 21, fewer than 60 percent of Americans approve of the job he is doing as president,” the Gallup report reads. The drop below 60 percent approval was fueled largely by a drop in satisfaction among independents, Gallup pollsters added.       Late last week, polls showed 62 percent of independents approved of Obama, compared with 54 percent in the last three days, according to NewsBusters. Obama’s approval rating among Democrats has dipped slightly, while approval among Republicans has not changed significantly.       While it may be difficult to tell from the glowing media accounts of his fledgling administration, even Obama’s highest approval numbers were never all that special. Gary Langer, director of polling at ABC News reports that Obama’s early ratings are in line with the one-month of George H. W. Bush, John F. Kennedy, and even Jimmy Carter.

20090227100918AAWaLmR	Politics & Government;Politics	Why is Chickenhawk Obama extending the war in Iraq?	During the campaign he promised a 16 month withdrawal from Iraq from the day he took office.  That would be May 20, 2010.  Now the date has been moved to September 2010...so I guess Obama lied.  Besides as Commander in Chief he has the power to remove troops the moment he was sworn in.  So the question is why aren't you Liberals more angry than a wet hornet right now because you spent years demanding that we leave immediately...you wouldn't be using a war as a political football would you?      Where I stand with regards to the war doesn't matter anymore, but you hypocrisy and situational ethics does.

20090227092905AAoYxjq	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	My boyfriend is being forced to pay rent on a house he no longer lives in. Are they allowed to do this?	The situation is by boyfriend is in a bit of a legal jam. He's been living in spain since january and will be there until july. when he signed the contract for his house in september he informed them he would only be living there until january and the landlord said if he found a  replacement to rent his room he could leave before the contract was over (48 wk contract).      My boyfriend found a replacement, moved to spain and then at the last minute the replacement backed out before signing anything. The replacement backed out after my boyfriend had moved out. now the landlord is writing to my boyfriend saying he owes ￡800 and a further ￡800 when the next rent is due in april. my boyfriend handed in his keys and signed out in january so feels this is unjust. He is trying to find another tenant to move in but having no luck since there's not much he can do from spain. The landlord isn't advertising the room at all.      I know he signed a 48 weeks contract but can they demand rent frm him now he doesnt live there? his dad died at christmas, so he had to pay for the funeral and is in debt already. he's desperate not to pay this and make his financial situation even worse.      Also in late october damp started appearing up 2 of his bedroom walls. he contacted the landlord several times and the damp kept getting worse. it was so hideous he moved into my house for a while. eventually someone came and put an extractor in about 6 weeks later. when he moved out in january the damp was still there. He'd had to move out for a while because of the damp and still paid rent, and when he did sleep at the house he had to move his bed and desk away frm the walls making it difficult to live in that space.       My boyfriend was told later by the person who was going to move in originally to replace him the damp was the reason he wouldn't move in. Is this a good legal standpoint to make sure the debt companies don't keep hassling him for money or take him to court?      Sorry for the essay but we know nothing about legal advice and can't afford any so this is the only chance of an answer we will get.

20090227115139AAMaGPs	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	How can I file a complaint about being mistreated by a magistrate in the Gary Indiana court?	I went to court over child support last year. I had allowed my older 2 kids to stay with their father after an earthshattering experience caused me to have to start all over from scratch. I kept my youngest 2 with me because they are not his and their father is no good. My ex and I had a good relationship for a while. I would provide any help I could with food, clothes, shoes, etc... Then he met someone and decided that I was nto doing enough and the mandatory child support order issued at the custody hearing became something he now said I owed him all along (even though he specifically told me not to worry about it). I am now working part time, going to school, and I have taken back my oldest son and am seriously considering the same with my daughter. Here is the big dilemma. He sent my son here last summer and has spoken to him maybe 3x since then, no order has been signed (he wrote a not to the school board though and told them he lives with me), and now the state is garnishing my wages for child support for my son and daughter (when he lives with me). They are taking 55% of my income, it is ridiculous. I make minimum wage, he makes a whole lot more (around 50-60k a year (thanks to the job i got him). He is now married to someone with money and the only reason he is asking for the money I owe now is that all her money goes on her 2 kids and his has to pay their bills. My daughter gets nada, nothing. I buy her shoes, clothes, school supplies, medication, toys, etc.. Up until this point he had an attorney and I didn't. When I asked the judge to appoint a guardian ad litem to help with the kids, the GAL got me in with the pro bono commission because he said I was getting shortchanged. Now I have an attorney who wants to file a child support ammendment after the custody transfer is legal, but he wants to file for it to change from the date of filing. I was told by another Indiana atty (a child support atty) that I can request a change from the time my son moved in.   I would do this but I went to court in December and the magistrate presiding over the case (my kids father collected fraudulent welfare benefits in one city while living with his wife in another). I tried to tell this magistrate that my son had been living with me. He screamed at me to shut up. I swear I never met this man and had not been rude or done anything disrespectful. I tried to tell him 2 more times and he threatened to jail me if I said one more word (he could because of the failure to pay support). Now I have seen this man in action on other cases. 2 of my friends sued their exes for support and this man told them that the guy needed money to live and they needed to stop being greedy (in both cases the kids were over 10 and had never received support). I feel he is hateful toward women and I don't knwo what to do. I told my atty but he said he has a good rapport with him. My whole world is riding on the outcome of this case. There is a lot more details I would need to explain to give the full story but there wont be enough room. I called CPS on their father because the one time he took my son for the day, he came back intoxicated (he is 12). My daughter has medical problems that are ignored due to a lack of money (because it goes on her daughters' extracurricular activities). I really would have paid what I could over the years but he said it was not a problem. Then last year....wham!! I also tried to explain this to the judge as well as the fact that I buy their stuff and he sent them for the summer with not 1 stitch of extra clothing so I had to go out and buy it all over agian (even thought he stuff at his house was paid for by me); but the guy told me he did not care. I said "Your honer, it isn't fair to ask me to pay support for a child who lives in my home that I am supporting" then he said "I really don't care, you will pay it or go to jail" I said "I am not able to pay 75.00 a week and raise my kids" He said "So you are saying you aren't paying it and I should send you to jail right now". At this point I informed him I didn't even make that much money and he said then pay half of what I did make. I have made a lot fo stupid mistakes in my life, but I have never neglected my kids. If it weren't for me, he owuld have let them wear shoes and clothes that were sizes too small forever while he bought expensive stuff and took trips with his now wife. I just do not understand this state.   So can I file a complaint about the magistrate? If he would have listened then my check would not be garnished right now and I wouldn't be trying to figure out how to make it till next payday on what is left. Technically according to the child support calculator I would owe him (i think it said) less than 25.00 a week, he would owe me (approx) 135.00 a week. This means after subtraction he owes me 110.00 a week for the last 8mths and plus no one gave me credit for all the money I spent buying their stuff over the years because he would not do it....A
