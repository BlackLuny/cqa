20090223155344AA7oEzO	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Scanners	Best scanner for *quickly* scanning loads of photos? Would consider flatbeds but would prefer something small.?	I have 10 photo albums full of pictures. I want to preserve them digitally but opening a lid and placing a photo into the corner of a flatbed scanner OVER and OVER is not my idea of a good time. Not to mention I don't have the space on my desk for one. Any suggestions? This would be both for the hardware side of things and potentially the software side if it's setup to scan and save photos quickly.

20090223164717AA5EFuq	Computers & Internet;Software	Windows Vista Home Premium not Genuine?	I purchased my retail computer from Best Buy a year ago, and it came with a retail copy of Windows Vista Home Premium.  During Installation of Vista, I am never asked for a serial number, and never have been.  Well, I reformatted a month back (I've reformatted before - same computer, same CD, same method), and everything has been peachy until I deinstalled some program (I believe it was some media player), using Vista control panel like any one should.  Unfortunately, when I rebooted my computer, Windows suddently decided that it wasn't genuine anymore.  Now, some functions of Windows don't work because it isn't genuine, I get an annoying popup at bottom telling me to activate, and each time I reboot or log on, I have to wait 15 seconds for it to give me the ability to log on without activating Windows.  Is there any way to fix this without getting a serial number from Microsoft or reformatting?  Thank you.

20090223164852AAkDfJG	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	Java abstraction question?	A programmer is building a hierarchy, at the root of which is a class, Root, with a default constructor that initializes several instance variables. Each object of the hierarchy has a unique calculate method. It is intended that members of the hierarchy will be stored in an ArrayList , and that the calculate method will be called on the elements of that ArrayList . It is not anticipated that the root class will ever be instantiated. Which of the following is the best strategy for creating the root class?      1.Create an abstract class with a public abstract calculate method together with code for the default constructor and instance variables.         2. Create an abstract class that includes code for the default constructor and instance variables, but omit the calculate method.        3. Create a concrete class that includes the default constructor, the instance variables and the calculate method.         4. Create an interface with a public abstract calculate method together with code for the default constructor and instance variables.         5. Create an interface that omits the default constructor but lists the calculate method as a public abstract method.

20090223170417AA4njTc	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	C++:  Having trouble copying pointers?	I have a character array, and a string object.   I use these two in a function to copy the contents of the sting object over into the character array.  I use strcpy, and use the c_str() function to convert the string to c-string.      This works fine.      The next time I use the function, it does the same thing again.  Problem is, the first character array I copied last time now has the same value as the new (second) character array I'm working with.  This is because the first is POINTING (Not copying, which is silly) to the string object... the string object gets changed, and the second array points to it, and now I just have two arrays pointing to the same thing, and it's useless.      I tried making a temp array, making it point to the string object, and then copying letters over character by character, same thing still happened.      To give a visual, it's like this:      Input string 1:  A   Input string 2:  B   Input string 3:  C   Input string 4:  -1      String 1:  C   String 2:  C   String 3:  C      How can I fix this problem?   They *MUST* be pointers, because they need to be dynamic (Be able to hold a string of any size).  I am allocating and deleting freestyle memory appropriately.

20090223170027AAjgAqX	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	Need help with array sums using recursive functions (java)?	My assignment is this:   Write a recursive function that will find the sum of all the elements in an array A, from position first to last inclusive. This function is a lot like the maxArray function, which you saw in the book and the lab. The definition of this function should start with    int array_sum(int A[], int first, int last)      It returns the sum A[first]+A[first+1]...+A[last]. Write a "main" function, which reads integers from the console and stores them in an array. Positive integers only -- stop when the user inputs a negative number. The main function calls your recursive function to find the sum, giving it the array and the positions where the user's data starts and ends. Assume at most 1000 inputs. The main function finally prints the answer. The user should see this:    input integer:5   input integer:4   input integer:9   input integer:-1   sum is 18      I am not really sure how to do it. I got this as my program      public class Hmwrk2{        public static int array_sum(int A[], int first, int last){       int middle;       int leftMax;       int rightMax;              if (first == last){ // If there is only one item in the array       return A[first];       }              else{         middle = (first + last)/2;         leftMax = array_sum(A,first,middle);         rightMax = array_sum(A,middle+1,last);         return A[((first-1),last)) + first];       }     }                   public static void main(String[] args){            int a = 5;            int b = 4;            int c = 9;            int d = -1;            int[]testArray = {a,b,c,d};            int sum;            sum = Hmwrk2.array_sum(testArray,a,d);            System.out.println(sum);                 }        }

I recently tried to download and install Google Desktop on my Dell Studio which runs on Windows Vista 64-bit version. Unfortunately, Google Desktop only runs on 32-bit versions.      The website mentioned that it does not run on Windows Vista or XP with a 64-bit version. It explained that if I want to attempt to run it on a 64-bit version to "do so by installing from a command line and using the '/force' flag."       When I did this I received a message from my command prompt window that it is not recognized as an internal or external command.       How do I fix it so that I can install Google Desktop? I'm not very computer literate, so basic instructions would be extremely appreciated.       Thanks so much in advance!

I know the potential risks associated with overclocking it, but I'm willing to take that risk. The thing is, I am a total amateur computer-wise, and I more or less have no idea what to do. If you can provide any tips, I would be most grateful.

Anyone know what kind of equipment I need?

As we all know, the HD feature still has some problems, and doesn't run well on low-end PCs.  Often times the video doesn't start properly.  So what you need to do is when you find any lag in an HD video, drag the slider all the way back to the beginning.  If it doesn't work, try again.  For me, this solves the problem.

20090222155458AA4mjd4	Computers & Internet;Software	I need windows xp pro 64 bit edition. Please Help.?	I built a new computer this week and chose to go with windows xp pro for stability over vista. I bought 6 gigs of triple channel ram not realizing that there was a limit that the operating system creates on the amount of ram you can have. I've come to learn that in order to utilize the ram i need a 64 bit operating system. I would still prefer to have xp over vista, and have heard of a 64 bit version of xp, though i can't find it. If anyone can help, it would be greatly appreciated.

Since it's not an iPod or Shuffle, I drag and drop them onto the player, and delete them off the hard drive after I've loaded them onto my player.  However, after I've deleted them off the hard drive, iTunes still appears to see them.  In the iTunes menu, next to "Podcasts," it shows a number (right now it's 443) in parentheses, which only gets larger.  Does this mean that the shows are still stored somehwere on my HD?  When I do a Windows search for MP3 files it doesn't show them.  I know I've deleted them successfully because they show up in the recycle bin and then disappear when that gets emptied.  Why does iTunes keep showing (443) podcasts which don't exist?  Where and how are they located on my HD?  If they're still there, that's a lot of files.

The company i bought it from had gotten it from another company.  They wiped out windows 2000 and put windows 98 SE on it, but the computer still has a 2000 sticker and number on the side of it.  If I put a windows 2000 cd in there and type in the code on the sticker is that all I have to do for upgrading it? Can someone provide a direct link to where I can see if my PC is compatible to upgrade? Thanks guys!!

20090222141059AACH2fw	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	Laptop Shutting down problems?	my laptop wont start up. When I first turn it on it will turn on just fine for maybe ten seconds or so and then shut itself off without even loading the grey and white hp screen. Can anyone tell me what is going on here and how to fix this?    I have recently taken it in to a tech shop twice now and each time they said they have fixed the problem and didnt, and said that it was working just fine for them, but when I bring it home it starts up this again.    He installed windows xp and has all the drivers. I have anti virus and defender on and running just fine.    It is not a ram issue, I recently had new ram put into the machine and am on 3g.    its not a graphics card issue either, recently had that upgraded as well.    Will choose best answer, please just answer the question, thanks in advance!

I build websites but.. I am terrible with the php language and im not following the tutorials out there on this topic.         i need to make a very simple, plain white html page with has a html form to upload files to a specific folder on my servers public directory using php.      the folder is called "uploads"  and is located in my main public directory on server which is called: public_html      my server is unix based and supports all php.      this is what i need it to do:         no file limit size at all.  ( i will be uploading some larger zip files, so i cant have a limit )      1: It must  deny allowing any upload of a php file or an exe file.  any other formats are fine.      2: it must place the file permanently in the folder called "uploads".  the reason i say permanent, i read in the tutorials that it will get placed in a temporary location and then get moved?  i just want the file to be uploaded to the folder, plain and simple.            can anyone  help me out and paste the html form script  and the php script here ?  plus of course tell me what to name the php file, permission setting, and things i have to replace on the code you post ( if any )?          Id really appreciate it.         thanks.

This is not a "ink fading away" problem, which would mean the cartridge is running out of ink. The printer just ceased printing colors and it shows me that the cartridge is empty.      I found information on reseting some cartridges, but the contact layout is not the same in the HP75 cartridge. What is the procedure to reset ink levels in my cartridge?
