The song "My Nemisis" is the bes tthing Disney has done since "Just Around the River Bend" in Pocahontas.        So why are there Phineas and Ferb haters?

Once upon a time there was REAL stuff on that channel...Lizzie McGuire and Even Stevens.  Now the brains of viewers are going to rot, slowly but surely.

20090203163314AAWxqLj	Entertainment & Music;Movies	BEST HORROR/SCARY MOVIES?	Hey, could I please have some suggestions of some of the best scary movies that you have seen. My friends and I LOVE watching scary movies: the scarier and freakier, the better! We've seen The Ring, The Exorcism of Emily Rose, and The Unborn. The Ring was our favorite, but we didn't think it was that scary. (The Unborn, we didn't think was good, or scary. We subsequently renamed it The Attack of the Flying Fetus).         The movie we are debating about seeing (renting) is Quarentine, or the Spanish version- Rec.       Would anyone suggest this movie, and which one? The Rec is in Spanish, correct, so we would have to watch it with english subtitles.    I believe what draws us in to this movie is the "home video" effect, shaky camera.    Are there any other real-scary movies that you would suggest, and if so, why?    Also, are there any other "home video" scary movies that are really good that we could rent?      Thanks!

20090203164527AArIlRx	Entertainment & Music;Horoscopes	Decipher this (other) Libra's intentions?	To those who have been keeping up with me and my chaotic life, this is NOT my ex. Surprisingly. Yes, I'm being serious. It's a miracle, I know.       So, I'm kind of 'talking' to this new guy. Generally, what attracted me is my opinion of him being really intelligent. He acts and talks as if he's about 20 years older than he really is. Not in a prudish way or anything, just.. well educated, whatever that means.       But anyway, he's a freakin' Libra, AGAIN. Why are they always Libras? I don't have any Libra in my birth chart. It's insanity and I am so angry at this constant attraction I have.       But back to my question, I was talking to him before, around November of 2008. I just kind of randomly blew him off, since he seemed to pay me a lot of attention, that I didn't want. At that point in time, my self esteem had drastically reduced. Therefore, I didn't want to hang out with anyone or even talk to anyone, so I avoided acquaintances at all costs.       Plus, he had a girlfriend, which caused a lot of confusion and initial suspicion to me.       So, I went from having these deep conversations with him every night, to just ignoring his existence, totally.      Then today, I changed my status on MySpace that I'm in the mood to do something productive. He messaged me saying he's in my town all the time, and that he wants to hang out soon. I agreed and told him to pick a day, in which he replied Thursday. This is the first time I've talked to him since, November 2008, I think.       What I'm not understanding is the 'girlfriend' part. I've flirted with him to see his response, and base my answer on that, but he doesn't really.. respond. He basically takes the compliment, and changes the subject. So I'm like, "okay, he's not interested in me."       What throws me off, though, is when I'd leave to go to sleep, he'd ask me not to go, yet. Then throughout the week, he'd send messages, telling me he thought about me that day, and I should get online more often, because he misses not talking to me.      Normally, I would feel really wrong telling anyone any of those things, if I was dating someone. Especially, since he's been with this girl for 6 years!  I think. That's not fact, just from my memory.       Honestly, I didn't even know he had a girlfriend! I found out from other sources. She's not plastered on his MySpace, but I do know he's been with this girl for years, as previously stated. I've before brought up topics, specifically about dating, which presented a perfect opportunity for him to talk about his girlfriend, and... he never would. He's never mentioned her.       Hmm, he doesn't have a reputation for cheating, whatsoever. It's not for sex, because as far as I know, he doesn't do "that," along with not smoking or drinking or anything. But he's the lead singer of a band, so he's certainly not taking advantage of that position. Haha!      All humor aside, he's a confusing Libra to understand. Unlike my ex, he's really, really quiet. Almost as antisocial as I am. But he's just about as cynical as I am, so that's pretty comforting.       The 'girlfriend' thing is the constant annoyance, that I keep looking back on. What if he genuinely wants to hang out in a friendly manner, and I'm just reading him wrong? Which, granted, is kind of unusual, but possible.      Anyway, what do you think?

20090203165841AA0hSaX	Entertainment & Music;Other - Entertainment	Does music affect human behavior - and why?	I have this science project I have to do -       and I chose the topic of:      "Does music affect human behavior, is so, what genre affects human behavior the most - and why?"      If it helps, the music genre I chose were:   'Screamo', Rock, Metal, Pop/Rock, Rap, Techno and Hardstyle.      My guess is that...      Music affects human behavior by the rhythm of the song, as well as the lyrics, or words that are being sung in the music. For example,       Jason Mraz - Im yours    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GMCw_9sG...       Gives you that "feel good/joy'' feeling - simply because the rythym and lyrics are so joyful, so relaxed.      Whilst...      The Devil wears Prada - Still Fly    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fzE7wzrB...       Has a hard, fast paced rhythm.      Go over to Rap...      Lil Wayne - Lollipop    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mt6R992n...       The rythym is medium-paced, with some hard beats - making it catchy - however, the words are mainly sex-related. Some people dis-like this kind of rap, usually because it's inappropiate and define it as 'made-up words into a beat'.      Obviously, not everyone likes the same things - which can affect this topic greatly.      ...Okay - basically... I want to hear what your opinion/guess/whatever on why you think music affects human behavior - and if you use a website, please post it under sources so I can look into it.      Thanks.

They're so perfect together, I still can't get over it, and they have that 'forbidden love.' Even though the show has been over for awhile now, I'm still completely obsessed.

There are people I don't know and people have different powers now? I'm so confused. I know there was a writers strike where they only aired half of the planned episodes. And thats all it has on heroes season 2 is 4 discs and roughly 2 episodes on each. Did I miss out on a lot of episodes or something? Did they complete the second season on T.v and i missed it?

20090203170710AAWke5b	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rock and Pop	Huevo's band of the day?	Today's band (oh who's kidding, I don't do this regularly at all) is Rocket From The Tombs, a protopunk band out of Cleveland during the mid-70's.  Little known during their existence, upon disbandment the members broke up to form two of the top influential punk bands in America, The Dead Boys and Pere Ubu.  Both bands went on to perform songs that were originally written during the time period of Rocket From The Tombs.  I remember the band reforming a few years ago, not sure when, and going on a reunion tour to play their old classics.  Unfortunately, work can suck at times and I was unable to attend these legends getting back together to do their thing.

20090202144903AA8WCbZ	Entertainment & Music;Movies	I cry at the Lion King but not at things with humans in as much?	Is this strange.    I just find the Lion King such a heart-rending story. The cruelties of fate, the unfairness of the universe, the circle of life, the separation. The song that really gets me down is actually ''Hakuna Matata'' (SP?) because Simba is growing up without his father, moving on, forgetting, living a lie...a lie that he didn't need to live.    I hate it how Scar manipulates the vulnerable young cub. I hate it how the land is sick under his rule. I hate it how a kingdom is ruined based on the selfishness of someone who does not care for the pride.        Does anyone else feel a fierce anger when watching this film? I feel guilty, because it affects me more than many human situations. It just feels so real.     But at the end, it feels like the circle is linked together. And that is sad, too.

20090202144949AAXGdsX	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	You Will LOVE This..(Promise)?	A farmer went out one day and bought a brand new stud rooster for his chicken coop. The new rooster struts over to the old rooster and   says,   'OK old fart, time for you to retire.'   The old rooster replies, 'Come on, surely you cannot handle ALL of these chickens.   Look what it has done to me   Can't you just let me have the two old hens over in the corner?'   The young rooster says, 'Beat it: You are washed up and I am taking over.'   The old rooster says, 'I tell you what, young stud.   I will race you around the farmhouse. Whoever wins gets the exclusive domain over the entire chicken coop.' The young rooster laughs.   'You know you don't stand a chance, old man.   So, just to be fair, I will give you a head start.'      The old rooster takes off running. About 15 seconds later the young rooster takes off running after him. They round the front porch of the farmhouse and the young rooster has closed the gap.      He is only about 5 feet behind the old rooster and gaining fast. The farmer, meanwhile, is sitting in his usual spot on the front porch when he sees the roosters running by.   The Old Roster is squalking and running as hard as he can.   The Farmer grabs his shotgun and - BOOM - he blows the young rooster to bits. The farmer sadly shakes his head and says, 'Dammit..... third gay rooster I bought this month.'

Whenever I try to sing any songs sung by other males they're Too high for me to reach singing, and I know I CAN go an octave lower, but then it sounds too low.... You get me?  SO I was wondering what I could do to remedy this problem.  It's like being stuck in the middle.  I DO find that I can sing songs orginally done by females much easier though.      I used practice by singing songs JUST outside of my range, and try to keep it in chest voice as much as possible but it felt too strained, like my vocal chords would tighten as well as my lower jaw.  I mean I was only practicing trying to increase it, but I didn't want to damage my vocal chords so I stopped.  Can you please help me?  Advice and tips on how to increase range?         One more thing!  When I breathe through my diaphragm, I find it much harder to hit high notes than when I just breathe through my chest.  Anything you have to say about this??

20090202153140AAqbFCd	Entertainment & Music;Comics & Animation	FMA Season TWO- Your thoughts?	As many of you know, the critically acclaimed anime/manga FullMetal Alchemist (Hagane no Renkinjutsushi) is starting a second season in April, this time following the original manga to the 'T'?  I'm curious as to people's thoughts on this.        I, personally, am not looking forward to it.  The animation (from the trailers released) is very poorly done in comparison to the original anime and Arakawa's style.  I liked the anime much better, quite frankly.  (Being very against the idea of EdWin and into the idea of Winry actually receiving character development)  Now, there are definite pros and cons to each, but I'm still very apprehensive about this new anime... Your thoughts?        (PLEASE no pairing bashing/wars!  I simply stated that I don't like EdWin.  I'm not trying to push RoyEd [my choice couple] on you or anything, so have the same courtesy.  You can talk about how pairing vibes affect your viewpoint, but no 'ROYED IS FAIL EDWIN FOR EVA' or 'ELRICEST IS THE ABSOLUTE HOTTEST', yadda yadda yadda.)

Puerto Rico is a spanish speaking country, they are not 'American', they are 'Puerto Rican' and they speak spanish. Puerto Rico is a latin american country.      Even when that country is associated with the US as a commonwealth since 1952, if you do not have cable-satellite TV over there you can't watch american networks. They have their own networks, and their own reality shows! Puerto Rico is a whole other country.       Why 'American Idol' went to Puerto Rico? Are they trying to attract hispanics living in the US and have bigger ratings with this? Who are they fooling?

20090202113856AAf3oHf	Entertainment & Music;Celebrities	If actor Jonathan Brandis hadn't committed suicide do you think he and Tatyana Ali would have married?	I read they dated from 1995 to 2001 and he killed himself in 2003 but still I was thinking it would have been interesting if their closeness had ended up with them staying together as Mr. Jonathan Brandis and Mrs. Tatyana Brandis (or Tatyana Ali-Brandis). I think it is interesting when people develop close emotional bonds like that as in deep emotional concern for each other because they almost mentally and emotionally merge into one person: when one thing happens to somoene, their loved one feels the emotional effect of it and I think the same is definitely true for the parent-child bonds that develop between fathers/mothers and their sons/daughters. It can be real deep!

20090202164211AA1CO3z	Entertainment & Music;Horoscopes	Sort of a long story, wanna help? Me, a cancer, and scorpio?	Okeydokey... Where to start.    Well, I'm a Sagittarius, and she's a cancer (Let's call her Kaily). Then there's this other dude, he's a Scorpio (Let's call him Joe). I'm practically in love with this cancer girl, but we've only known each other for about... two years. Joe has known her since they were little... childhood friends, you know how it goes. Anyways, I've been flirting with Kaily recently, trying to let her know I like her more than a friend, but she just can't seem to take the hint. Joe has noticed this (since day one that i started) and doesn't like it. I can tell...    Anyway, Joe has told me to back off. But I don't want to, I realllllly like Kaily. Well, I found out from some of his friends that he's liked her for a while, but is worried to make a move. He made her cry once, It was totally accidental and a missunderstanding, but I have NEVER made her cry. (Which seems like a plus for me "D)   She seems to like me, but I can't tell if it's just friendly, or if she's afraid to make the first move. She's realy obedient to Joe though, like if he calls her over to him she goes to him like a magnet  ( NOT even joking, it's kind of freaky really) and will not come back for what seems like EVER! Sometimes I will go over to see what they're doing, and Joe will just walk away saying a quick bye to Kaily. But she's always smiling when i come over and starts talking to me too. I can't tell which one of us she likes better.       So basically, I'm wondering--- should i back off and let 'Joe' have his way with her first and wait for the flame to die, or should i fight for her love?    I've been told that Scorpio's love a challenge, and i don't want to make this a fun game for him. Esepcially since he'd LOSE!      Oh, and if there's any cancer girls out there, what would you do? If you found out that two guys really liked you, who would you pick? The one you've known your whole life, or the one who you've known for about two years. I don't want to fall into the 'friend' catagory too long, tell me how to get out in case I've already been catagorized in there.       THX!!!! "D

20090202160432AAoygqy	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rock and Pop	What bands that are still writing/performing music do you think are now irrelevant?	I ask because I heard a new U2 song on the radio today at work from their new album, and the first thing that came to mind was "Really? A NEW song from U2? Still?" Another contributing factor to this question is watching Bruce Springsteen perform last night and the only word that came to my mind was "irrelevant". I'm surprised we didn't get a newer act for the halftime show. YET ANOTHER factor to asking this question is wondering why Faith Hill got to perform before the game, and not say Carrie Underwood or Taylor Swift or someone of that nature.

20090202160236AALNixv	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	Does anyone have any jokes like this one:?	johnny,what is your problem?"    Ms. Brooks was having trouble with one of her first-grade pupils. "Johnny,what is your problem?" Johnny answered, "I'm too smart for the first Grade. My sister is in third grade and I'm smarter than she is! I think I should be in the third-grade too!"    Ms. Brooks had had enough, so she took Johnny to the principal's office. The principal agreed that he would give the boy a test and if he failed to answer any of his questions he was to go back to the first-grade and behave.    He started by asking Johnny some simple arithmetic. "What is three times three?" "Nine, Sir." "How much is nine times six?" "Fifty-four." And so it went with every question the principal thought a third-grade student should know. The principal looked at Ms. Brooks and said, "I think Johnny can go to third grade! He seems smart enough."    Ms. Brooks said to the principal, "Let me ask him some questions?" The principal and Johnny both agreed.    Ms. Brooks asked, "What does a cow have four of that I have only two of? Johnny, after a moment, answered "Legs, Ma'am"    "What is in your pants that you have but I do not have?" "Pockets!"    "OK,what does a dog do that a man steps into?" "Pants."    "What starts with a C and ends with a T, is hairy, oval, delicious and contains thin whitish liquid?" "Coconut."    "What goes in hard and pink then comes out soft and sticky?" The principal's eyes opened really wide and before he could stop the answer, Johnny was taking charge. "Bubblegum!"    "What does a man do standing up, a woman does sitting down and a dog does on three legs?" "Shake hands, Ma'am."    "Now for some 'Who am I' sort of questions, OK? First one: You stick your pole inside me, you tie me down to get me up, and I get wet before you do." Johnny, quick as ever, answered, "Tent!"    "OK, a finger goes in me. You fiddle with me when you're bored. The best man always has me first." The Principal was looking restless and a bit tense. But Johnny was on the ball with "Wedding Ring!"    "I come in many sizes. When I'm not well, I drip. When you blow me, you feel good." "Nose."    "Right, I have a stiff shaft, my tip penetrates, and I come with a quiver." "Arrow."    "Good, now for the last one. What word starts with an 'F', ends in K', and means a lot of heat and excitement?" "Firetruck,Ma'am!"    The principal breathed a sigh of relief and said to the teacher, "Send him to university, I got the last ten questions wrong myself!"

Under?ath - To Whom it May Concern. It is an amazing song, I really love the intro where its like them singing in almost a choir...really good. those of you who think they are just a gay screamo band, I suggest you listen to this song.   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaoWQbg7I...    3. Nightwish - 7 Days to the Wolves. great song, no matter what genre of music you normally listen to.   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VP17wT1VM...    2. Muse - Take a Bow. This song was the one that made me think to create this list in the first place. It is just that epic.   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aU02FSndb...    1. The Ocean (collective) - Isla Del Sol.

Here's how I personally feel:  The 1st series still has a large fanbase and strong popularity, It was great because the story was different from the manga and the movie was just pure genius, not a happy ending but not sad. It wasn't Happy Go Lucky poofter type thing. It ended just 4 years ago and since it's still big why make another series?     I know for a fact that the new series is gonna be good, but they should be more patient and allow a wider gap between the series, plus it would avoid fillers which is the last thing FMA needs.

It just pisses me off to see some television corporation tell us teenagers how we should act, what we should look like, and what we should like.  Its almost like soft-core fascism.

I'm a 16 year old girl and also an aspiring singer and I'm having a little trouble taking off, first off my parents don't believe in me, i would love to be working 100% on my music but i am a junior in high school and that's unrealistic, especially because my parents aren't behind me. Anyways, so i really don't want to go to college especially because most colleges don't offer that major i want to pursue which is contemporary voice, and also my mom wants me to minor in video production (again doesn't believe in me). I'd much rather go to a performing arts school, which there are some that extend to 19 years of age so i could get two years instead of just going my senior year of high school, and then try and make music and work in jobs that give me enough money to survive and also spend time in studios and create some demos. I feel that school will always be there and if needed I can always back and better my education. Also because of all these set backs like my parents and school i can't do anything and i feel restricted in my artistic presentation because as soon as i say i want to do a certain song my parents will tell me i can't because they don't like it or i have to focus on jazz songs for my college auditions (i study jazz, contemporary, classical and piano) I just started performing at this open mic night at a lounge and i do singing competitions with my singing school but non of that gets me anywhere, please help!!! i just want to make a living on my music it really is my passion i just feel stuck! :-( thanks in advanced

HELP!?	ok so this is going sound a little rude, but if you understand the circumstances I was under, you'd be able to realize how much I did not mean to say what I did. So I was really drunk this passed Saturday night. My friend told me this was the worst she's seen me in awhile. I ended up sending a text to a guy I was dating, because I was pissed at something he said and took it the wrong way. I said to him "Ok mr. im 32 and bald and a firefighter that makes only $30000 a year." I said it like that, n he didnt respond after that text. The next morning I apologized a bunch of times, and he responded saying "I dont want you to text me again period. this is the last time i will text you. i dont let people talk to me lke that and youve done it too many times" I apologized again and said I really didnt mean it and that ive been a really messed up person lately etc. He lives on my block, 2 firehouses down. I wish there was something to do, because the other night I realized I just dont want to drink again like that for awhile. I really care about the guy and screwed up royally. Anything I can do to show him how truly sorry I am.. and how much I did not mean it? IT would be a lot of help. I don't know what to do right now and when I ask my friends, they just said oh hell forgive u give it some time, you guys live on the same block. But I dont know, this is pretty bad, I wish I could take back what I said I really did not mean it, just said it out of anger. Please help!      If there is anyone I can show him that im sorry. we have been having some problems and I guess i blew up on him. i just want him to forgive me, I just dont know what to say or do. Also, it happened on sat night, so how many days should I wait to bump into him and speak to him person, since Id rather talk to him about it in person.

20090202162740AAzdMmx	Entertainment & Music;Music;Other - Music	Ringing in ears after a concert?	I went to a concert Saturday night, and my ears still haven't stopped ringing. I know that there are thousands of questions about this, but I don't want to read all of them.      It was my seventh concert, and the first time my ears have ever rung after. Usually, I feel deaf for like an hour and it gets better. The ringing is really starting to scare me because I don't know anything about it. It is probably the most annoying thing that I have ever experienced, and I will never go to a concert without ear plugs again.      Oh, and I was in the first row. Directly in front of the speakers/amps. Now that I have experienced this, I do realize the importance of wearing ear protection, but I didn't before.      Is there anything that I can do to help it heal faster/prevent it from being permanent?

20090202121545AAf67SD	Entertainment & Music;Movies	Does anyone know of a drama, romance, period movie from the late 90s?	I don't remember the name of the movie or anyone who was in it. I remember renting it from Blockbuster off the New Releases shelf in the late 90s. It's a drama, romance movie set back in the king/queen (period) days. I do remember a little bit of the plot. A mother has one of her daughters become a mistress/kept woman or whoreish type girl to get more power/money. It was a great movie. If anyone knows what this movie is please tell me!!! Thanks.
20090202121551AAN6nVN	Entertainment & Music;Movies	How could you not like this movie?	Hook, a movie about peter pan starring Robin Williams and Dustin Hoffman (if you haven't seen it, watch it now!), is a classic in my family. We use to watch it all the time, and now when it is on we all freak out, surrounding the tv. I mean it is so good! But I was talking to a friend about it the other day and he said he thought it sucked. I became interested, and looked it up. It got horrible ratings! Now I want to know if you guys (and girls :-)) like it or not, and why.
