Moi, je rentre  18h30 et je n'ai pas forcment envie de faire du mnage ou repassage alors je prfre m'occuper de ma fille. C'est mon mari qui rcupre notre fille chez la nounou et qui lui donne le bain en rentrant. Il aime bien faire la cuisine donc c'est lui qui fait les repas. Pour ce qui est du mnage, on le fait le we mais c'est vrai qu'avec la pitchoune, il y en a toujours de partout alors je range une fois qu'elle est couche. De toute fa?on, avec des enfants, on ne peut pas avoir tout le temps une maison nickel. Moi, si le mnage n'est pas fait, ce n'est pas non plus une catastrophe. Si tu travailles, tu ne peut pas avoir une maison qui brille et t'occuper de tes enfants.

Si ton mari ne te donne pas de coups de mains, comme c mon cas, tu n'as qu' programmer les choses  l'avance.  pour moi, les repas de famille, c au cours des week ends. Au courant de la semaine, chacun de nous djeune dehors.  Pour le mnage, j'essaie de ne laisser rien s'accumuler. je rale parfois sur mon mari pour qu'il range ses affaires, ca fait du travail en moins. Je fais la vaisselle  mon retour du bureau , doonc vers 17h30, en mme temps, je prpare le diner. Une fois din, c l'heure du sommeil de mon bout de choux, je reste  c?t de lui jusqu' ce que la mission soit accomplie. Je prpare aussi mes habits et ceux de mon enfant avant de m'endormir.   ceci dit, il m'arrive parfois de me trouver dans une maison "upside down", dans ces cas, je le n de tel de la femme de mnage que j'utilise en cas d'urgence, c tout!    c notre bataille!

Tu n'as pas le temps de cuisiner en semaine? Tu prends 2h30 par week end et tu fais les plats de la semaine que tu congles ( sortir le matin avant le boulot,  rchauffer en rentrant).  Tu n'as pas le tremps de faire du mnage? Pendant que tu cuisines le dimanche (pendant la sieste de la grande), ton mari passe l'aspiro et la serpillre  fond. Tu entretiens 2 fois par semaine avec le balai (aspiro trop bruyant pour enfants) et une ponge ds qu'une tache appara?t (pas dr?le mais ?a marche!).  Bient?t (promis!) ta grnade fera son rangement toute seule ( prsenter comme un jeu) et toi tu auras plus de temps pour tes activits.  Mon avis: ds le retour du boulot, tu encha?nes les bains et le d?ner, surtout en hiver il fait nuit t?t donc pas gnant (les miens ont fini de d?n avant 19h). L ton grand peut t'aider (achte lui un plumeau, mon grand adore!) et toi tu fais un peu de mnage/rangement/lessive...)  En grandissant, on trouve des astuces pour aller plus vite (aussi parce que les enfants sont plus autonomes): Pierre a 2 ans et quand il est dans le bain (Louis, 2 mois, se repose dans son lit  c?t) j'en profite pour papoter et surtout faire le mnage de la pice!

J'ai un gar?on de 4ans 1/2 et un petit de 8 mois, je travaille et j'en suis au mme stade que toi.  Te recommander de prendre une femme de mnage??? je ne connais pas tes moyens financiers et je pense que t'as dj du y penser.  Voil mes trucs et astuces (en prvision du deuxime BB qui arrive)    Pour le mnage:  Je range la maison rgulirement et en priorit les chambres des enfants qui dorment quand tu es disponible. Puis un soir de la semaine, je m'occupe  du rest du rangement pendant une heure quand les enfants sont au lit. Et je dpoussire les meubles et desinfecte les WC/salle d'eau etc...Je passe un coup de balai dans la cuisine et un petit coup de serpillre    Le lendemain: je passe l'apirateur dans les pices pendant que les enfants jouent.    Mon mari fait les courses    Un soir dans la semaine, nous couchons les enfants plus t?t que d'habitude. L on se fait une assiette charcuterie/pain/fromage/vin et on cuisine a deux tout en parlant. Ca para?t moins long quand on est deux.  L'un lave les lgumes, les pluche et s'occupe de la conglation, l'autre fait les plats puis celui qui pluche, congle.  On pluche les lgumes pour 2/3 plats. Par exemple, on pluche deux kilos de carottes qui vont nous servir pour la soupe, la pure de lgume du petit et du boeuf carotte.   Vu comme ?a, ?a fait industriel mais ?a marche.  Ce soir, nous avons en 1 heure et demi prparer   - un hachis parmentier  - un boeuf carotte  - une mga soupe  - 4 pots de lgumes frais pour BB ( avec  chaque fois un lgume mis dans la soupe+ viande prvu galement pour le hachis)- Carotte/veau - Haricot verts-Veau - Potiron-Steack hach - Pomme de terre/Steack hach  - Hareng fum/pomme de terre vapeur  - Carotte rape  -Salade verte  On ne couvre pas toute la semaine, mais pour les autres jours, on prvoit des plats plus simples: C?tes de porc/Salsifi etc...  Comme nous ne mettons pas  table le jour o on cuisine, on gagne vachement de temps et on arrive  pas tomber dans le plan chips/jambon    Une fois acheve, on cure la cuisine  deux en sirotant notre verre de vin.  Ce moment de dure labeur est devenu incontournable car on parle de tout et de rien. On passe du temps ensemble et on arrive  avancer.  Deux soirs dans la semaine, je plie le linge devant un film.    JE rentre le soir vers 18H30  la maison et je me pose en ralit vers 10H. Mais le WE est presque consacr  notre famille.

Ici en France les jeunes femmes clibataires et enceintes sont trs bien accepter, ne vous inquitez pas mais regardez 'essentiel est le plus urgent, et a la rigueur, annulez le rendez vous pour l'avortement, c'est seulement VOUS MME qui peut prendre cette dcision si grave., et l'annonce d'une nouvelle naissance n'a jamais tus personne au contraire.;C'est votre corps, vous avez le droit de  garder votre bb.

On est horrifi par la peine de mort, mais condamner  mort un tre vivant pour son confort matriel ou le "qu'en dira t-on" est un mal de notre socit.

Mfie toi d'un compagnon qui refuse ses responsabilit. Assume, ce sera dur, mais quel bonheur et tu diras plus tard: "comment j'ai os penser  le tuer".

Mais si tu ne le sens pas, si ce n'est pas dans tes envies ou tes priorits, n'hsite pas et fais-toi avorter.  Un enfant non-dsir, c'est mille fois pire qu'un enfant avort.

f4zg7LHLaa	i would have to say for the 1st time in a few weeks my morning has been pretty good!   partner set off for work at 8, as usual. Reece and i got up, and i sorted him out with breakfast, changed nappy etc, and i got a text saying     "coming home, traffic is wild. there's a Big Breakfast with your name on it xox"     lol! so i got a few extra hours with my partner AND i got a McDonald's breakfast AND i didn't have to drive down to the bank because he did it for me! :)     i am currently plonked down in my jammies again snuggled inside with my son, and daddy is on his way back to work!|`|u23sua9daa	Yes it as.|`|A6EkF2wCaa	ive had a good start to the day....schools closed cuz of the snow.....yay :D      x|`|TkJmj97Daa	My day has started awful as well I was expecting my mum to visit today to help me with the kids but she is not coming because of snow my 3 week old is crying constantly dont know why cant get hold of midwife. I moved house 2 months ago and now feel isolated as I use to be a walk away from my family now I see no one. I cant drive as I had c section so house bound and my boyfriend constantly goes on and on about the state of the world which drives me nuts. Also I have had no rest since baby was born so very tired and fed up with life.|`|xy0W50Lqaa	My 12 month old daughter still has nasal congestion from a cold but I only had to get up at 12am and 5am so not too bad.  I got woken up at 7am by my neighbour wanting to use the phone and because of the heavy snow and bitterly cold air I've decided to miss play group this week.  I'm hoping to take her tomorrow.  Snow looks lovely as long as I'm indoors with my central heating on!|`|TklfCPh6aa	Yes, I'm having a great morning. It's almost 8am and the sun is shining in thru the window a very Monet painting like colour. The baby is sleeping and I'm having time to reflect on how lucky I am to have her and a husband who loves me. And I'm excited to go to work tonight as I've started back one day a week only since she was born and I miss my creative job. I'm looking forward to going to a martini party next week while my husband looks after our daughter. (He's hoping I'll come home intoxicated and we will make baby  2) :-))    Hope your day goes better and I told you this before but again, I love your babys' name!! Fabulous  ps. No fresh snow here, just the smog covered stuff.|`|ZYlr9TSBaa	Mine could've got off better! All our snow is gone (lol), and my daughter had me up every 2 hours in the night, so I am very very tired..... but she's wide awake so fingers crossed she drops off soon so I can shut my eyes again :)|`|pDRAciBnaa	well holly wanted to start the day at 6am!! then i looked out the window saw the snow and realised i was trapped in for another day :( soooo went for a walk in the snow nd OMG how hard is pushing a buggy in the snow?!? i ache from head to toe!! and to top it all off i feel sick to the core! im 8weeks pregnant and feeling very, very sorry for myself.....oh and my partners at work until 9.30pm :(      so not the BEST day....|`|ACXoLn2daa	NO. I am moving house.|`|vRk86MYnaa	Well, got an email saying my school is shut, again :)  Went out to build a snowman, but my hands went so numb and painful, so I'm back in now warming up again and drying off.|`|uhBkbgoaaa	NO BECAUSE SINCE I GOT UP ALL I HEAR IS MY DRAMATIC FAMILY ARGUING AND YELLING ABOUT WHO WILL PAY FOR GAS , LIGHT BECAUSE ECONOMY IS BAD. SO SICK OF EVERYDAY ARGUMENTS, THATS NOT NORMAL
ihbPQUjhaa	Your little one is gonna hear a lot more of those words, just keep telling him that it's not nice to use them and why it's not, explain why those other kids might use those words. Next time you see the teacher mention it to her, maybe you can find out from your little one who these kids are, but I'm sure the teacher already knows who they are. This way she'll also know that you don't raise your child to be using that kind of language, and she might keep an eye out for bad language...good luck, stay strong...raising kids is tuff|`|kIwwxg4naa	these things gotta be told.  Directly!  Just tell him its not the right thing to say.  He might be beaten up or something.  use a little threat in there|`|ZYEIsoDDaa	yes you hav to tell the teachers...        why is your  first grader  son in the same class as people in year12..    un-exceptable behaivour like that would be expected with older teenages that like hanging in the same class|`|7uqAS3Ozaa	mostly from students, i think! and luckily he knew it were bad words!|`|31269476570b3829c86de1e8c487e423aa	this is the risk you take teachers can't be around every second|`|94a35c89cad76d7f41e298b8c841e4f5aa	"Words are just words...they're not good or bad, they're just words.  How you choose to use them is what's good or bad.  If you use them to be nice, that's good.  If you use them to hurt someone's feelings, that's bad.  There are certain words that people with manners don't use in public.  You can use those words anytime you want, as long as you're in the bathroom with the door closed."    That's what I told my son when this happened.  They're not bad words.  They're bathroom words.  Feel free to use them all you want...but since I know you have manners, you will only use them in the bathroom with the door closed.|`|0dqfwKk7aa	First, it is a BAD idea to have a children in that age range... It's only asking for trouble.  Remove your child from that class.  Kids, as early as 10 start talking about sex.. explicitly.  You don't want your child around that.  Soon, he'll be learning more than just bad words.|`|J7QO7zj1aa	A better thing would have been, imho, to teach him the meaning of those words rather than banning him from using them without reason in his mind. But should definitely look into how he came about the words, but i can tell you it was from another student whose parents cuss around their child and don't teach them the proper use of the words|`|ETVr1PdRaa	Bad words are normal nowadays. I learned f**k when I was 7, etc. At different ages, different things seem worse. I called my step father (60) silly, and he got right POed. Told me I was a disrespectful twit.    But I digress, it is innapropriate for your child to be exposed to that. If I was you, I would contact the teacher, if only to make them aware that that type of language is being used. Perhaps he got it from an older child, and they could keep a closer watch on who the first graders associate with.|`|5O3JD29iaa	I think to an exstent your being a little over protective, but at the same time I have to say I'd be the same way u are. I'd talk to the teacher about it, that way maybe the teacher can put a stop to it. I don't have any kids, but I do have 2 nephews and his mom has to watch her mouth around him because he's 2  and already picking up the cuss words, then the other's 9 and he just knows better than to say them. but don't get mad at ur son even thou he knew it was bad because for one they'll learn from it and for two at least he came to you and told you about it that way you can talk to the teacher about it. I know it's school but he's going to learn and hear about worse things than that. I'm not being mean or trying to sound mean I'm just trying to help out, but prolly isn't helping. Seriously thou I'd just go to the teacher/s n tell em about it that way they could prolly put a stop to it, if that don't stop then go to the principal and tell him/her about it see if that helps. Good luck with all this, sry to hear about it!!!!|`|AjqO1aJgaa	This doens't ring true. Why does your first grader think it's okay to use bad words - even something he should be proud of? He clearly knows they _are_ "bad words". Why have _you_ brought him up to believe that using bad words is clever and something to take pride in?    I'd have died too. Of shame. Try teaching your kid that saying bad words is wrong.|`|giKCTfnfaa	sadly, this is one of the minor bad things your child will learn during his education. my youngest said the "f" word when he was in kindergarten because he heard an older kid on the bus say it.  it really won't do much good to complain to the teacher (it's pretty safe to say they didn't teach it). children are a product of their own environment.  apparently there are a few kids in that class who don't have a very good environment.  simply explain to your child those are adult words and not to say them again.  if you blow it out of proportion, then guess what?   he'll just say them again knowing it gets under your skin.|`|u0mZAPuDaa	I want to know what 'Adrian's' idea on teaching your child the meaning of those words would be?    How do you explain to your first grader what *uck means? Seriously?|`|52577eb5bd0b6858ac300a21a42802b3aa	Kids pick things up easily. Not to worry. As long as he understands to never use them, and doesn't hear you using them, it's okay. You should identify the person who taught them and speak to their parents.    But my older sister's first word was **** and now she's off to uni to study criminology. You'll be laughing in a few years. =]|`|3KjkJGHjaa	lol teachers do nothing except say "dont say that" I learn those words when I was like 4 or 5.|`|G50ucmllaa	You tell him the truth.  That those are inappropriate words to use.  You then email the teacher so she is aware of what is going on.  Chances are she knows where it came from.  But if your child does not already know that these words are bad word, you need to stop sheltering him.|`|1zj4Lz9Raa	I would definitely confront the teachers or staff at the he's attending.
eI9mkxS5aa	I'm not a mum, I'm a 15 year old graphic designer.. tri-wheelers are made for compatability and easy-steering..  quad-wheelers are meant to last lifetimes and indeed they are harder to steer.    As for sand.. neither of them were made for it.  3wheelers are not recommended if you have a child in a more active phaze (3-4 year olds) because they might manage to turmoil the heck out of it and it might fall.|`|71b04ae04f4a311b132775b2d931bd76aa	i think it's key to make sure you get quality.  there are crappy 3 wheelers and crappy 4 wheelers.    if possible, borrow some from friends, its really hard to know what will work for you without trying it.  at the very least, try putting a heavy bag in it and push it around the store with one hand.  that will give you an idea.

Conor should be good. :)|`|082435507b63479df5aa4cf6de65fa39aa	Conor! Is there a different way to spell it though?    Conal reminded me of colon for some reason... Not good!|`|zt37UkLJaa	My name is Conor, and I have never before met someone with the same Gaelic spelling. I find it's a great name because it's not uncommon, but its unique in it's spelling. I would definitely recommend not to use Conal, because of the way it sounds. My advice is, unless you have another better name under consideration like Rocky :) then go with Conor.|`|L4LPVtgfaa	Connor is a beautiful sounding quality name.....  Conal, i'm sorry, sounds like you made it up and the kids will call him anal..|`|g9EAOJJKaa	Conor  i think is the best|`|BI57bpEsaa	Connor !  My nephew is Connor and he is a star which I am sure yours will be too!|`|IYVxt96Baa	definately prefer conor. prefer spelt with 2 n's so connor though x|`|b402ba45b26091ee4a1857b1349f54d9aa	Have to say to everyone I love the name Conal.  Its my nephews name.  He is 13yrs old and never gets called anything about colon or anal. If you live in Ireland I think you'll find that most people already know the name Conal.
uhj76Fkpaa	my daughter does the exact same thing.Twisting all night long.I have her in her own bed(which you should aslo do immediately) with blankets around the bed so that she won't fall down!The ony thing I do is to wake myself up 2-3 times during the night to check her.My pediatrician told me that children at that age do this sometimes and that it'll go away when she becomes a little older.Good luck|`|uZnnCjJ0aa	she maybe has excema so check for excess skin on her bed - i know its sounds gross but it works   i think its really bad dreams such as there were "bees on her" like my daughter has so she will try and scratch them off. that why u saw her itching and when she is moving she is running away from her nightmare or at least trying  i hope i helped
71b04ae04f4a311b132775b2d931bd76aa	Only you know your son.  14 is an age where some kids are more mature than others, so I would go with your gut.  I would just keep going with it if it makes you happy and gives him security, he will grow out of it.  If you are not sure, maybe find other ways to connect and give him that sense of attachment.|`|xOr67VDiaa	I think he will naturally stop doing it, once he becomes at the age of his life he feels confident about himself he will back away from it.. he probably never had the chance to cuddle up in his mommies bed, why would anyone stop it?? we all need to feel loved and maybe its his way of knowing you love him.. i wouldnt stop it, and i think its great you love it so much, just dont get attached to much cos one day he might wake up and not do it. till then be what he needs and dont push him away because that would affect him more and make him feel like he did something wrong, when how the heck is it wrong to love your mom so much? of course we teach them boundaries, but he is still new at his teens and he will change fairly quick, so let him do it naturally..|`|decWPAHkaa	No I don't think it's appropriate to spoon with your adoptive 14 year old son. Just my opinion.|`|1j60dOgOaa	no...|`|Syn2excFaa	I would say that it would be best that you gradually start decreasing the time that he does this. It would be best if this doesn't become a habit or if it already is then slowly start breaking it.|`|Xvec5VyPaa	Umm, honestly I don't think I'd let it happen much longer.  I mean really, he's 14yr. not 5yr.  Plus he's adopted??? I have a 12yr. stepson whom I've been around for 5yrs. and I'd freak out if he were ever layed up with me in the morning.  But then again maybe it is just a sense of security, for the both of you. As far as being healthy goes, I dont think so.|`|0ZxYrtv0aa	Honestly, the fact that he's adopted is what changed my opinion. I'm sorry, i know that sounds biased. But, I think because of the family he's come from, and from what you've described, he's just happy and grateful to be in such a loving and caring environment. After being in such a harsh environment before, he actually feels loved, wanted, and needed now. I think that's great. :)    You'll probably find though, that as he gets older, and has a girlfriend and things like that he'll probably stop doing it. Don't be upset though, I'm sure you know you're lucky that at his age he's acting like he is, and that all kids grow out of showing as much affection as they would when they're younger. It's just normal.     But i think this really shows you that adopting him was a great decision, and he obviously loves and trusts you very much. You must've done something or everything right! :)    Good on you! :) Congratulations!|`|0QbAiQwhaa	That is cool, I think just wait for him to grow out of it because it might really upset him if you tell him no and avoid him from doing it... I slept with my mum pretty much from when I was a year til about 14 myself because I was scared and just wanted my mum, but after a while I saw that I was a big kid and if my mates found out they would tease me so I just grew out of it... just treasure your bonding times like your are, you sound like a cool mum :)|`|qoS3gUukaa	I think under usual circumstances it wouldn't be an ideal situation. However, considering what your son has been though I think it is something he probably needs to do to catch up on all the affection and closeness he has missed through his life. Just to make sure that he is going in the right direction though I would make sure that he is bonding with friends his own age and learning to get close to people in school and having friendships. Once he knows that you will always be there for him he should feel confident enough to start to branch out a little over time. If you are able to encourage him to have a balanced life (i.e with you involved and with his friends involved) then he will be getting off on the right foot.     I just wanted to say what a wonderful thing it is that you have done. There are far too many children out there who need adopting and unfortunately the older they get the less chance they have of that happening. It really is an inspiring thing you have done and I hope you and your son have a brilliant life together! Xx|`|GPMmlhuqaa	there is nothing wrong with ur son showing some love for you! would u rather he was telling u he hates u and wish he was never ur son???       if it is still happening around age 20 than there may be a problem. but he is just showing some love. he is a loving person and that is what the world needs. i would rather have a son that loves me than wishing he was never around me.|`|wXitIq8Qaa	14 years old? or 14 months old? 14 months old..yea fair enough but not 14 yrs old for crike sake! he's not a baby regardless wether you love him to million bits and vice versa..are you going to let him sleep with you when he turns 16?|`|wHVx9HZVaa	You lucky thing!  I am so jealous. Both of mine have decided enough is enough but they both used to come into my bed until around 14/15  The youngest is now nearly 16 and apart from Christmas (when we all pile in to bed together including the cat!) and the odd time he feels unwell he will only sit at the end or occasionally crawl in under the duvet at the other end of the bed.  You sound like a wonderful loving mother and he must be so glad to have finally found someone to love him.  Enjoy and don't worry unless he is still there when he turns 18!|`|hZf8aJkYaa	Yes its fine. As long as anything isnt going on.|`|ZtDvpgAVaa	I think that many people responding to this question have forgotten that this boy was only introduced to your life one month ago.      At 14 years old I remember who I was, and what 14 year old boys were like.      You are an attractive older woman who is showing him love and affection, perhaps for the first time in his life, and it is up to you that it his introduction to love, especially cross-gender love be kept appropriate.    You must not feal 100% comfortable with the situation or you would not be asking for opinions on it.     My opinion is that it's better to be safe then sorry.|`|t4sznqw6aa	well you just recently adopted him??? if that is the case and he has had a bad child hood, you should be happy he is embracing and actually being a happy kid, that means he still has a good heart. and you should let him enjoy being a child and having that family bond while it lasts, but you cannot forget to try to get him to mature and devolop as a teen cause he is going to be in highschool? so you have to try to get him to build some social skills and start being a regular teen! cause I know how tough kids can be on other kids that still havent grown up and are what you can call 'outsiders'|`|f6373d0f140da2e4ad613b8e53131d7eaa	I am not gunning for the best answer here, just throwing in my 2c.     I think its terrific that you obviously changed his life for the better (much better) by adopting him.      Given the circumstances do I think anything is wrong with this? No, I dont. I think it's really great.   Now, granted... when you try to introduce a man into his life you may have issues since he is so close to you and wont like some dude laying in bed with his mom. But thats a bridge you can cross when you get to it, just wanted to make sure it was on your GPS.|`|be058c1b39851aef68a41bd14df6d359aa	You have to know your kid. If you know your child and how his intentions, then I see nothing wrong with it.  Since he is adopted, give him a chance.     A child could be reaching out for love and affection this way and hugging is fine. He probably needs this kind of affections if he did not get it from his other family.     Touching you in funny places is when it becomes weird. As long as he knows that you love him and that he can talk to you about anything-I'm sure everything will be okay.  He may also find a girlfriend (or sorts) in a year or two     He may turn away from you and you may find yourself asking, "What did I do wrong, why is he running away from me and going to all of this friends?"    That is what you do NOT want. You want him to be close to you.

NoUkTQCgaa	That all depends on why the child was taken away. If it was an illegal adoption, well, the child should go back to his or her first parents. If it was a temporary foster care situation, and the first parents complied with their treatments, then the child should go back to his or her first parents.       A child belongs with his or her natural family. The only reason to not be with their parents or a member of their extended family is if the child would be in danger. Period.|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	if she was taken away then the adoptive parents should have the child, after all she was taken away for a reason. Maybe the parents could have visitation once in a while.  it also depends on the child, she is better off with the parents she has known for the past 3 years, she would have no memory of her other parents, she was only 2. That would be like taking her and giving her to compleet strangers, when it comes down to it, it is better fot the child to stay where she is at now,and if the other parents really loved her then they would let her go.|`|2wyDALHgaa	If, as you say, she was "taken away" from her birth parents then it must have been done for a reason.  If, after that, the child was adopted then it was done through proper legal practices and the birth parents wouldn't have any right to appeal anything therefore a Judge would not have to decide anything.      Who gets custody?  The adoptive parents retain custody.    EDIT:  Now that you have changed the complexion of the whole scenario from one of North American sounding legal removal from birth parents and legal adoption by another family to one of villagers somewhere raiding and kidnapping a child who is found living with another family three years later that changes the WHOLE thing.  The child should be, and would be, returned to his/her natural parents.    Of course unless your villagers have a different legal code, or any legal code at all.  They may just boil them all in oil and chow down for a cannibal dinner.|`|8Qxb7OZOaa	Back to the natural parents.     The child will barely remember the Aps over time....may even heal from the trauma of temporary separation from natural parents.    Can't say the same thing if the Aps were allowed to keep the child.    ETA....and the agency and Aps should be thoroughly investigated to see what they turned a blind eye to.    Eta....Kristy sorry to disappoint you but this question was not asked by me.......(getting a bit paranoid?).  Sounds like this kids teacher is as well.....Maybe she bought a baby from Guatemala too.|`|1uCZFaR2aa	This is cool Ind...  Log in as someone else and then answer you own question.  (Hardy-har).    The child shoud be with it's LEGAL parents.  No matter where or who they are.  So long as the LEGAL parents are not abusing the child.|`|hzgFAJv0aa	Hi. Questions like this always make me think of King Solomon. (I'm not religious, but this story was told to me as a child and I've always thought that it was a wise decision.    The Story: http://www.touchoffire.com/nk.html  The Legal Meaning: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judgment_of...    I think in a case such as the one you describe (were it real) the fairest and most thoughtful decision would be to have the two families both involved with the child. Since neither family has done anything wrong, I say that because of the age of the child and the bonds that s/he would have formed with the adoptive family. Were the child younger or less time had passed, I would say the child should be returned to the biological parents with visitation rights to the APs. I would urge the two families to co-parent the child. Both families should have recourse against the actual baby-thief.    I believe that there is no such thing as too much family and that all children should receive as much love as they can. JMHO.|`|AKJwWqdZaa	Well, if she was "taken away" from her parents and adopted, then I am going to assume that their rights were terminated. Therefore, if these parents were even able to find a judge willing to hear their case, I would be willing to bet that he would rule in favour of the adoptive parents.|`|BTuFtui3aa	If the child's biological parents' parental rights were terminated by the state/court, the child should stay with the adoptive parents. The adoption was legal, and the biological parents no longer have legal claim to her. A child who was removed from the home will not be returned by a judge under these circumstances. TPR by the courts is final once the appeals process is done.    If the child was kidnapped or the adoption was fraudulent, the child would be returned to her biological parents. If the adoptive parents were innocent parties and not involved in the kidnapping, the child would probably be transitioned between homes rather than uprooted abruptly, and continue visitation with the people who adopted her.    Who is more "dedicated" to the child doesn't really enter into it. Custody is a matter of law, and dedication can't really be measured and held to any legal standard. It's a matter of whether parental rights were legally terminated, or not.|`|AXshzI0Kaa	Kidnapped??     Sorry, kids is going back to natural mom and dad in birth village.     Case closed!!     :-)    ETA:    This is very interesting.....at least two people do not  beleive the child should return to NATURAL parents. That is very interesting. A crime was committed and a couple of children were dragged in  to the middle. No matter the adopting parents did not know a crime was being committed.......the natural parents did. If the children were attached to the ADOPTING parents then they have the ability to attach and with the ADOPTING parents assistance, they can transition BACK in to their natural parents home.....again, CASE CLOSED!!     The only way to stop baby trafficing is to implement stiffer penalties at Tribal Council. If more Tribal Members knew this would happen and they knew thier sorry a$$es could get sued and then imprisoned then perhaps baby napping would stop....or at least curtail.|`|uz8rZMG8aa	Since the child was taken illegally for no reason from her biological parents, then I think she should be returned back to their care.  However, speaking as an adoptee, hopefully after 3 years her previous adoptive parents could stay in her life somehow, as it would be very traumatic to be ripped away and have her attachments broken like that.    But if they knew they were adopting her illegally that's different, they shouldn't be able to see her.|`|iVcaB9h7aa	The adoption was illegal even if the adoptive parents had no idea the child was kidnapped.    The judge must rule on the side of the law, which means the child will go home with her/his natural parents.  This is the legal and moral thing to do.    But the poor child is probably going to suffer and will need the village wise person to help him/her cope with the feelings of abandonment, disorientation, fear, rejection, loss, and separation anxiety.     The adoptive parents will also suffer for the rest of their lives.    There is no win-win with your scenario.  Everyone has lost something.|`|E7MgO2pZaa	If she was kidnapped by raiders and sold for adoption to another couple she still belongs to her parents, the ones she was kidnapped from. As heartbreaking as it may be for the adoptive parents to lose the girl they have called their daughter, can you imagine how devastating it has been for three years for the family that lost her? Can you imagine waking up every morning feeling as though there's a hole inside of you?     I can. That's why I think it's right for her to be with her natural family. It's also legally right for her to be with her natural family.|`|5SJ5RIASaa	I personally think the families should be made to share custody of the child if at all possible. Both sets of parents are victims if the adopted parents didn't know the child was illegally taken. At the age of 5 the adoptive parents are probably the only parents the child knows. It would be very painful for the child to be ripped away from the only parents she knows. If the adoptive parents are guilty of any wrong doing then of course the child should be reunited with the biological parents at once but if they didn't know the child was taken illegally then all four parents should find a way to be a part of the childs life. Even if the child is reunited with the biological parents then the adoptive parents should still be some part of the childs life. This was a good question for your teacher to give you to think about. It will be interesting to hear all the different opinions on this matter. This is sad for the adoptive parents and birth parents but just once it should be the child and her feelings that should be considered she has all ready been took from one set of parents and had to learn to bond with a new set of parents now some of you want her to be taken again and learn to bond all over again with the birth parents. The unselfish thing for all four parents involved would be for them to share her and for them all to raise and love her.
0GTwQS7Oaa	She needs to be actively involved in the reading by taking notes as she reads. There are a number of different approaches to studying lengthy text - can't remember the details as it's been a while since I studied but essentially the student should:  1) do a quick scan of the chapter first, noting the chapter titles and gaining a general idea of what they are about to read.   2) Then they read in depth and take notes while they do so - if it is a long or difficult piece then read it in chunks.   3) After each section they should take a break from reading and review their notes and recall details of what they have read.     There are other techniques - creating a "mind map" of what she learnt rather than linear notes works well for some people.    Explaining it to others is very helpful - the more senses are involved then the easier the brain's job of incorporating it into the memory.    There is music that can help concentration - Bach & Mozart - but a 15 year old may not appreciate them. Apparently some of their music matches the brains natural waves (not a good explanation but I can't remember the details)|`|SsfnitjXaa	Sounds like test anxiety.

You have the power of acting a part in life that is totally different from your true self. Your manner is quiet, as a rule, and this quality gives you the appearance of being strong and determined in the eyes of your fellow-men and women. It enables you to get your own way when you want it. You are not as practical as some people, and in keeping appointments, you are not too punctual. Your greatest failing is that you are versatile and that your energies are directed into too many channels. Concentrate on fewer branches of work and pleasure, and you will greatly benefit by the change.   You take all of your responsibilities quite seriously. As a result you have much ambition and will be sought after by your superiors to take on additional responsibilities. Therefore, you should direct your goals toward career positions in an executive capacity. some more info please write to me shanoomathur@yahoo.co.in|`|kIwwxg4naa	train her not to be so nervous
KbcbAKi4aa	My husband was like that with our first son. When I finally got to the core of why he was so stern with him, the reason was because he wanted to make sure he didn't turn out to be a whiny little mommas boy. He said that ALOT of boys are treated like little girls, and turn out to not have a back bone as men. I understand his point, BUT  I asked him, on a case to case basis, to bring it down a notch. And he did. I have to remind him that the boys still needs hugs at the end of a talk, to reassure them that he is talking to them out of love for them. Unfortunately parenting doesn't have any "RIGHT", answers, it is something that you will both learn as you go. Now, two children, and on on the way later, we are on the same EXACT page, for the most part. We are both disciplinarians, and both have different tones, but they are in our children's best interests. Hope I helped! =)|`|145RUNQHaa	Well i'm with you on this one.i know it's awful but mums are more tuned in to their childs feelings than dads they can empathise more and have a natural instinct to comfort them.i don't think what your husband is doing is that bad i though you were going to say something worse.on the other hand i don't believe it's the correct way to deal with a toddler tantrum.it's all normal for a two year old it's a difficult age for them they get frustrated so easily and upset over small things and it is a normal stage in their development it does not mean he will turn into a whiny older child.your husband doesn't set a great example when he gets angry with your son he should be setting a calm,gentle example for your son to follow and not an angry one.maybe have a chat with your husband and try distracting your son instead?this always works with my son who is nearly two if he starts to get upset we put on a cheery voice and say 'look at those birds in the garden aren't they lovely!'you have to keep up the cheery chat for a while but it certainly stops my sons tears and is a much nicer way than getting angry.sometimes toddlers will have a bad tantrum where distraction won't work straight away then you should wait nearby until he has calmed a little and try then.toddlers need to supporting through this time where they are just learning it is hard but you are right forcing them to stop crying won't do a bit of good he will become more frustrated and you may start to see that in come out in other ways.i don't believe in time outs either for a two year old this age is all about distracting them and then taking them back to what they did wrong and making a game out of what they should have done instead.when they get well past three and almost four when they will have a better understanding time outs can be effective if you explain clearly what they did wrong sitting them at the dining table for a couple of minutes then going back and explaining what is expected of them in the future and if they have listened rewarding them when ...|`|q0JTN9QAaa	I think it just shows him that the way he is expressing himself is not acceptable.  When your son learns that this way of expressing frustration does nothing he will find other ways.      This teaches patience and self control and is not a bad thing.  Many parenting sources will tell you that this is O.K.  He is not hitting him for doin it he is helping ot calm then down.  Your son is not bottling up he is learning to deal.      Think of it this way you have some people that are working with tools and something goes wrong, one person throws the tool and screams, the other might lay it down and step back till the moment passes.  Neither is bottling up one person is just maintaining more control than the other.  You husband is teaching your son this control and it will help him a lot when he gets older.    Children are much smarter than we give them credit for even the parents that think their children are smarter than everyone Else's don't give their kid enough credit in most areas.  Your child can not express himself because he has no past experiences on how to express himself so you husband is teaching him.  When words are easier for him he won't be throwing fits at 6 or 7 like many kids are still prone to do.|`|26Qb0cUjaa	That sounds extremely unhealthy for the world of today    Just tell your husband to stop being a ********|`|uhj76Fkpaa	first of all you should know that your husband is only trying to help.I really don't believe that he doesn't love your son...he's only trying to make him a better child.If you think that he's overreacting to your son's tantrums talk to him and let him know how you feel about it.I should say though that if your son gets away with it every time he throw tantrums at that age he will demand to continue like this in the future which of course is unacceptable.Good luck|`|1k6UUC8qaa	listen you tell your husband to take a parenting class or something tell him to take out his frustrations on someone else and pick on someone his own size this kids going to hate him and if he doesn't quit it the door swings both ways it you know what i mean remember your son comes first and you are the only one to stand up and speak for him i don't think that if this kid was 6 ft tall and 180 pounds your husband would treat him the same or maybe he will complaining nothings good enough maybe all his life tell him to quit while hes ahead and do something constructive to raise his child that bully routine doesn't work they call it the terrible twos for some reason omg if he cant stand the heat tell him to get out of the kitchen and by the way a word hits harder thank a fist.  good luck always stick up for your kids they come first big macho man telling off a two year old how impressive|`|rISHTfK3aa	Your husband is just trying to help your son toughen up.

You can have your son's doctor talk to your husband.  You can read a book like "One, Two, Three Magic" that will teach you how to handle your son's tantrums.  It would be better to teach your son that tantrums don't get any attention at all, because kids will have them just to get any attention, even negative attention.

Tantrums are normal at 2. Sure discourage tantrums but dont discourage him from crying, there are alot of articles written on this, cut one out of a child magazine and tape it to your fridge.
KcfBOa9vaa	you posted this in the wrong section.|`|pzLDXL6gaa	I'm sorry, I don't think this is the place for that.    Try googling her name and where she lives and looking her up on social networking sites. Failing that, ask your friends if any of them are still in contact.    Harriet|`|DpHEQGtuaa	try social networking sites and just speak to everyone who might know about her.    go get her!|`|082435507b63479df5aa4cf6de65fa39aa	I'm sorry, but I think you are a little lost.    However... I say... GO FIND HER! Why let love slip away... unless you're all creepy and stalker-ish, and she just doesn't want you... Which I hope for your sake that THAT is not true! =P
YOt6uTSzaa	Personally I do not agree with that, maybe as an alternative if all else fails, but I believe the better thing which is the more difficult, but better parenting would be this:    To talk to them, show them, some how make them see the error in their thinking and your say is final. I however am not saying they can not voice their opinion, by all means that is a must...actually it helps you to understand how and why they are coming to the conclusions they have. Which in turn helps you guide them to what is right or wrong about it.    A child should respect the parents opinion with out compromising.    This is just my thought/opinion because, every child is different, each has his or her own unique personality and every situation is different, especially according to the age and temperament of the child,  but I feel this is a good over all general rule that can First be applied before relying on other alternatives....|`|diAqosiIaa	to me the whole thing you are the parent and the child is the child. but i believe in that sometimes children should be able to come up with their own decisions about there life. this shows them that you trust them with their decision and also it helps them learn. With that being said not everything is up for discussion. being the parent you should know if they have a say or not|`|71b04ae04f4a311b132775b2d931bd76aa	sure it's fine, but you have to take individual situations into account.  You are the parent and you know what is best, but at the same time it is not going to hurt them to have some control over their own lives.    Something that helps is to avoid saying no if you don't really mean it.|`|zytviwOSaa	Ya compromising with children is very good and usefull.|`|GnXfEdegaa	I think it should be "open to discussion". I think I've heard Dr. Phil say it's a good idea also.  As long as your kid is doing it in a respectful way and not arguing.|`|LKIhUMCgaa	it depends on wut u're trying to compromise on. of course there r some things that shouldn't be allowed at all without any kinds of agreement, but certain things are good to compromise on.    besides it teaching kids problem solving and all, it also makes them respect u more as their parent bc they see u as a reasonable person who's not closed minded, they'll be able to open up to u more, which could be a benefit in the future, like if ur child might get into drugs, instead of hiding it from u, they just might actually say something to u and ask for help.|`|LNnRSLdtaa	yes   your supposed to raise them to live in the real world  but most parents seem to be dictators    if you compromise with your child (espically teens) they will respect you alot more for it|`|sVrkjixAaa	It depends on their age and maturity. Letting kids decide how to run their lives isn't a good idea, but strict dictator-like parenting will lead to rebellion later in life. Find a happy medium that works with your kid.|`|FiUprYsvaa	I think you should let them compromise.  You aren't giving them power you are just giving them say.   Giving them power would be giving them ultimate say in all decisions.       Just remember being a kid and having no say, how that feeling of no control whatsoever felt horrible.|`|C22jeMVhaa	It depends on what you're compromising about. Cleaning their room after the movie maybe. Fighting with their siblings or staying out too late no.Eating veggies instead of ice cream no. It just depends. I compromise with my kids about the little stuff often. None of the rules though. When I was a teenager I compromised with my parents occasionally about curfew and when and where I could drive. It just depends on what you'r etrying to teach them.
x97x8dVXaa	i can very much relate to your experience myself.  I'm not going to put those experience out in a public forum, but i would be willing to email with you regarding those experiences and how i got through them.    It is possible to do what you are asking, legally, through a process called emancipation.  The courts would effectively declare you to be competent to act as an adult.      and just for the record - the overwhelming majority of people are damaged goods.   The state took me out of my home when i was a little older than you, and probably the most important lesson from that was understanding we had no control over what was done to us growing up; but some day, very soon, you will have control.  you will have to make a choice to allow the past to make you a victim, or to learn from it what you can, rise above it and make decisions that will not allow you to remain a victim.   Laws vary from state to state, and i do not have much personal experience with emancipation - but from what i remember, the court will want to see that you have the means/resources to support yourself independantly - job, job skills, adequate education or means by which to support yourself while attaining an education.  There may be a legal clinic in your area that could help you with your particular case.  If not, many large corporate law firms will help you "pro bono" - that is free - or refer you to an specialist who can help you.      In regards to your question about gender adoption preferences, try to not let that get to you.  I do think it is harder for boys to get adopted once they're in their teens.  There is a perception, right or wrong, that boys at that age are going to be too difficult to control.  But be careful, do not allow yourself to feel like because you're a male, there is something wrong with that or you.  It really has nothing to do with you as an individual, but merely preconceptions people have based on other people.     Do you have a social/case worker you can contact about the situation in your foster home?  I know it is very hard right now, and running away or emancipation may seem like an answer in the moment - but you want to focus on long term and your lifespan rather than the difficulties of the moment.  I am not telling you "dont do it" only because i do not know you or the specifics of your situation.  I would encourage you to seek out a trustworthy adult and talk with them.|`|hzgFAJv0aa	Hi, Lee,    I am sorry you are having such a hard time. Unfortunately it is harder to find adoptive homes for teens - especially boys. People have all kinds of silly notions about kids in foster care and a lot of people are missing out on wonderful kids like yourself. Please don't let the general public's ignorance make you feel bad. You deserve much better.    I wish I could say something that will fix all your problems but the best I can do is offer you some resources that might be helpful. I hope you will look through them and see if there is one or two that might be useful to you.    http://www.fosterclub.com/ & http://transition.fosterclub.com/  http://www.fostercarealumni.org/  http://www.golivewire.com/forums/groups....  http://orphan.org/index.php   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emancipatio... (This is something you may want to consider but be warned - it is a LOT of work.)    Good luck to you and i hope that things get better for you soon.  Peace.|`|p61Ccuvyaa	hey i have been through this you can email me cjandbug@hotmail.com|`|uZnnCjJ0aa	lee darling im very sorry to hear your story - you so8und like you live in a slum - an awful place- BUT- you cant give up now  its not legal- you cant until your 18   you can stay at a college rented place though  thats all i can really tell you  sorry babe|`|qQA94jPXaa	you need to get ahold of an ILP worker if you dont already have one. they are an independent living program. ive heard that they should be able to help you with getting a job and setting up an apartment. im not sure though too much about what they do because there was only one for the whole county when i was in foster care so i only saw her once and never got ahold of her again. but talk to your foster care agency and see if they can make an appointment for you to meet with one of you can probably find it on the interenet or a phone book for one in your county. i would suggest being persistant with it because you might be left in the same situation as i was where i got no help. i hope this was helpful and i wish you the best and im sorry that you are going through this i know how hard it is cuz i went through it too if you ever need someone to talk to you feel free to email me|`|P2yRAWiJaa	I can tell you one thing that's a fact.    If you were in Louisiana...my husband and I would adopt you.    We'd help you find a job, finish school, get over your anxiety (or get meds), go to college if you wanted and eventually have a younger brother for you *adopted as well*.    We are just starting the adoption process.  I see lots of kids that are 13 and up that people just won't adopt because of their age.  It sucks.      That is why we are going to adopt an older child that has already been in the foster system for awhile. Give them a home for good.  The kind I wish we could give you.    You should be able to go and get a job with, or without, being emancipated.  Running away would probably make things worse, but getting a job would keep you out of the house for awhile.|`|XW2Bvwfcaa	Hi Lee,    Just the fact that you were already 5 when placed in foster care made the chances of you getting adopted slim, and yes, being a boy made them slimmer, along with each year that has passed.  But, keep in mind that this is not a reflection of your imperfections, but rather, or society's in general.    I'll be honest; I'm not sure if you can move out on your own yet, but what I do know, is you can take extra classes, early bird classes, etc.- talk to your school counselor- that can help you to graduate highschool early like I did to escape home!  Then you can live in a dorm once accepted into college.  Your school counselor can help you with this as well, and since you are not adopted, your foster parents cannot force you to stay home and not live in a dorm (like mine did).    My husband and I are in the process of getting certified to adopt an older child/ teen in Texas.  You are probably a bit too old for us to adopt because my age is too close to yours to be your parent (27); however, if you ever need someone to talk to, feel free to e-mail me.  I also hope you will start visiting churches until you find one you are comfortable with if you haven't already had that opportunity, as soon as you are able.  God will put people in your lives in His good timing that will make you realize just how special you are, as well as be your family that you can call your own.    Take care, and God bless you!!!
NqEZ120iaa	Play is a child's education. Boy do they have it tough, learning at least 12 hours a day!|`|inZ9CWBiaa	Yes - absolutely. That's how they figure out how the world works, what they can do, cause and effect, how to get along with other people, what they can do, that if they keep trying they can figure things out... you get the idea. Play is as good as it gets, learning wise.    It is vital for brain development and school readiness.    Keep playing - keep making neurons!|`|tjNJAn75aa	Totally. From baby to even school age i think they learn an awful lot through play and as they get older they are also learning not just physically but emotionally too. Reading books helps their imagination. My son is learning his learning his letters with some toys at the moment.  He learnt his colours by playing with his toy and counting numbers when we play too. When they are a little younger they learn motor skills by picking things up and then say with  building bricks or they learn social skills by playing with other children. They learnt about different textures and such, the list is endless. have a look at this for more. I also think playing with your child and getting involved, praising them and making it fun builds their confidence and having this confidence at such a young age helps them learn and develop even more!    http://www.zerotothree.org/site/PageServ...|`|B9lNQxRlaa	Yes - when they are babies anything new they do and see will be teaching them, as they get older they learn through play, ie - playing with blocks they are learning about how things fit together, motor skills, etc, playing with dolls - using their imaginations, roleplaying etc, playing outside with the ball - co-ordination etc, playing with friends - sharing, working together etc, playing with their toy cars - sorting, role play etc - I could keep going on but you probably get the picture.|`|1k6UUC8qaa	yes shapes colors coloring books any thing you can think of and lest them use their imagination|`|rISHTfK3aa	Yes most definitely. All children learn this way.
szVvf7Nkaa	This has to be so hard on you watching your daughter crying out for help and watching her destroy herself in the process. And it has to be even harder having to deal with her as a single parent. But if  you can send her to a wilderness camp then she will stand a better chance. And I think the sooner you do it the better it's going to be for you and especially for her. Your daughter is not to be trusted. But I think you already know that. If she started to make up lies about you then you don't know how far she is willing to go to hurt you more.     UK princess gave you an honest and positive answer to your question. So you can see that it does work. But there are some kids that do go to a wilderness camp and they come out the same way they went in. But that doesn't happen that often. Some kids think that they know it all and they think they have nothing to change. And they think that it's the whole world that owes them. But in your daughter's case you said that she has many lovely qualities, a great personality, bright as a button, and is stunningly beautiful. And I'm sure if you send her to the wilderness camp that she is going to change her life around.    If you decide to send your daughter to the wilderness camp then prepare her ahead of time that you are sending her there because you love her and you want her to free herself of whatever is going on with her. And remind her of her qualities, great personality and let her how bright that she is. Also let her know that you want a mother and daughter relationship but you can't have it as long as she is this way. And don't ever feel guilty for sending her to a wilderness camp because if you send her there then you are giving her a chance in life. My sister went through the same thing with her son. And she had to send him away so he could get his life back and he did. Good luck.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	My best friends brother went to one in Montana, I'm not sure of the name. It was actually more like a brat camp/school. He stayed there for quite some time. Almost a year I believe. He changed COMPLETELY. I'm talking a full 180. It really helped him behavioral and growth wise. He's now a very responsible, respectable person. It did work for him.     Witht that said it does not work for everyone and you really need to research any place you send your daughter to if you decide to do it. Some of the places have records of not treating the children very well.     I wish you all the luck with her. Hang in there. You will figure something out. :)|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	Military school, The wilderness camps are not as good, as they used to be.    Do a search on Google with the keywords, 'death wilderness camp'.  You will see stories about kids that have died.|`|i8EMuPJiaa	they do  lol  i was sent to one when i was 10  prepare for her to hate you for about 4 months though  then she will realise its for the best|`|3KjkJGHjaa	if you were religious, you wouldn't have this problem. just tell her shes going to hell and send her to boot camp.|`|pDGVTLoFaa	I sympathise with your situation totally it is a hard stage to go through the "teenage phase" and I agree that a brat camp would work as they are based on tough Love this is why in society today that teenagers are behaving in this fashion your daughter will learn to behave by having to earn her privileges. I hope that you have a good rest if she goes and you sound like a loving parent all the best for you and your daughter and believe me you will get your bright loving daughter back. xx|`|PQ7HYITBaa	I don't know about brat camps specifically but when I was 16 my parents sent me away to boarding school.  Did me a lot of good.  before that I was drinking, using heroin, I was violent and had anger issues.  A change in environment helped a lot.  now I'm a physician specializing in internal medicine with two daughters of my own.  So I would recommend you get her away from whatever is causing her to act out, even for just a little while.|`|WluRS5ivaa	You can only do so much. Try and find her a male role model that she can relate to. a grandpa, Uncle or someone willing to spend time with her. Those camps help teach skills and may help her admit she has a problem but she may refuse to participate. Its up to her to make the change.|`|ETVr1PdRaa	Huh. Okay, this IS a 15 year old with sever anger issues writing. My parents tried all the  psychologists and psychiatrists with me too. It didn't work - they're pretty much useless.    But I can tell you, that if my parents sent me to one of those camps, I wouldn't turn out better (they sent me to this weird one in a different province last summer) I would HATE them. I would pretend to be better, happier, and just stifle emotions. I turned to self-harm, and if you do that, she may too.     Honestly, she's angry. Try finding things that she can be angry at - get her a computer, a drum set, something she can do angry things productively on.     That's just my outlook on it, I hope she gets better! :)|`|AtDlNnIBaa	i am to sure about brat camps. but my mum sent my brother to a sort of pgl camp one summer to see if that would help. it did for a few weeks then he just turned angry again. i also had to phone the police before. it is so horrible you feel so bad. i am 15 btw with  17 year old brother who has the some problems has your duaghter. (:|`|gdOFLIjbaa	Hey(:    I'm a 15 year old and that girl sounds a little bit like my twin sister.  You says she has problems dealing with the fact that her father 'abandoned her' however maybe if you place her in 'brat' camp then she will feel like your abandoning her aswell. she might hate you for a long time for it. she is obviously looking for attention due to the fact thather father left her behind. my step dad and dad have left me but the thing is if my mother did that to me i would feel utterly lost.     she's a teenager. Your suppost to be the mother. If shes as bad as you say send her to brat camp. But being the parent you should sacrifice your happiness for her.     Maybe by you doing all those things she feels lost. she doesnt understand why you would call the police on her ect. you need to understand shes still a kid who still counts on her mother to protect her. Maybe by you taking her to countless people she feels as if you think theres something wrong with her.    Btw maytee 'Anger, violence, drinking, smoking, compulsive liar, school work gone down the drain. etc etc' thats what you do to be cool these days at school. if shes as bad as you say then you should send her to brat camp even if i as a 15 year old would hate my mother for it and it would drive a wedge inbetween us.    im sorry if i have offended you. but its my opinion(; i really hope that things get better between you and your daughter. whishing you luck.|`|5Eb8Zlqmaa	I read this and it reminded me of myself (in your daughter's position) not long ago.  I was put in a Hospital though, twice. Each for a week at a time.    You say that she was cleared of mental illness and such, but they also help a great deal with emotional issues. I had the same thing due to my own father.  I did not like going at all, but looking back it I am thankful. It really gave me time to be alone and straighten things out with myself.    I was taught successful ways to control my anger and mood swings in a positive manner and I now stay away from negative influences.    I'm not saying that putting her into a Hospital is something you should up and do, of course, but if you are looking into options I would certainly consider it one.   It definitely "got me back on track as a human being" =]    I wish you and her the best of luck.|`|HrAvPcXpaa	i do think brat camps work but what i would also suggest is that when she has come back forgiven u etc etc. take her to a councillor or someone similar so she can discuss the issues that she has with her dad.
tjNJAn75aa	I prefer pre schools to child minders. I just feel more comfortable knowing nothing bad will happen to my son when there is more than one adult watching each other rather than just one woman who can do what she wants when mummy goes.      Here's a list from the yellow pages. Call them all and see who has the most recent vacancies. Try to stay away from "day nurseries" and try to stick with play groups or pre schools as they're less formal-less enrolement paperwork, cheaper, more vacancies, not as strict with the kids.    http://uk.local.yahoo.com/Strathclyde/Gl...|`|rISHTfK3aa	Contact the www.ncma.org.uk - National childminding association. they can help you get in touch with childminders and nannies in your area.
1CryEnb3aa	The meaning of first morning is your first urination upon waking up.  If you don't get up till noon, test right then.  Or if you get up at 7 AM, test then.  You need at least 4 hours for the concentration of hcg to build up in your urine. If you wait till later in the day you have peed several times decreasing the concentration.  The hcg will be there no matter what.  It just depends on how soon you are testing.  Hope this helps. Good luck!|`|ed052b6f800dc43932558f491194a7b8aa	ive had poitives no matter what time ive used them  go ahead and take it when it comes if u already late x|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Just take it whenever you want as long as you wait at least 4 hours from the last time you urinated.|`|yRlIXECTaa	The best time to take your pregnancy tests is during the morning time...around 6-10am.

71b04ae04f4a311b132775b2d931bd76aa	It all varies SO MUCH!    My body was quite sore after both my children because it really is hard work.  Depending on what positions you are in for your labour you may have sore arms and legs for a few days.    Your perineum will be swollen and sore for a few days, worse if you have stitches.      Contractions (after pains) lasted for a couple of days.  Advil helped, you can get herbal tinctures that help too.    I strongly believe the most important thing you can do is stay in bed for the first ten days.  Just lie in with your newborn, breastfeed and eat and drink.  let your body heal, let your milk come in and get settled, and get to know your baby.  Doing too much is the  1 way to have a sore crotch and bleed too much.    Sign up your friends and family to each pick a day, and they can come over for 2 hours to tidy up your house and make you something to eat.|`|ZYlr9TSBaa	I felt weird, in the sense that it was weird not being pregnant anymore and having this little person to look after! Yes I had cramping, especially when I breastfed but that's because of your uterus shrinking back down...... I had some aches cos I had the epidural so I was unable to bend over for a couple of days. Plus I was tired lol. My daughter is 3 weeks old and I still feel weird being a mum.    ETA: I'm 3 weeks post partum and my bleeding stopped at the end of last week. The cramping stopped before then as the blood flow lessened (sorry tmi).|`|AA11842267	i jus had my first child 5 weeks ago and i felt horrible afterwards i went through more trouble than most my mother thought she was gonna loose me well first of all im 16 years old and i had to have csection i have a liver disease my father died from on my mothers bday of 2002 and my son Jeremiah was born on my mothers bday as well of 2008 her bday is december 30th...and i lost alot of blood during my operation swelled up really big i had to have blood transfusion and be given 3 pints of blood i stayed in the hospital for 4 days went home my incision busted open 1-8-09 and had to go back to the hospital was admitted stayed for 6 days my son had to stay home he couldnt be up there was wasy to young to be around me at the time so 1-8-09 was the first time i was ever put to sleep because i was awake in my csection thats how they do it now ..i had an eperdoral bcause i was gonna have my son natural but i couldnt it hurt to bad and after oushing for 2 hours the doctor said they was gonna go ahead and take him csection i was already a week over due my due date was 12-23-08 but me and my mother and the doctor still thinks i carried my son a month over since i went through so much trouble i mean it was hell i thought i wasnt gonna get to c another day at one point in time.. and n e ways on 1-8-09 when i was put to sleep and had surgery again had to have my incision cut back open because it had busted open and started pooring blood earlier that day ..i had a blood clod in it and yeah after i had my son 12-30-09 all day on 12-31-08 and 1-1-09 i was passing huge blod clods so finally the doctor well dr fitts had to manualy go inside me and pull the rest of the blood clods out of me....on 1-1-09 i went through real hell the doctor advised me to spoil my one child and dont have ne more its lible to kill  me and i wanted more children in the future ya know i have a whole life ahead of me im on homebound right now but i do my school work ,,gota part time job take care of my son help my mom around the house  i plan to go to college after i finish high school and do something good for my self unlike mos of my family i wanna make my mother proud jus because i had a baby at 16 that dont mean throw ur life away quit school dont work most teenage girls think its to much for me i cant do it all i cant go t school i have a child to take care of and then when most of them say that they jus wanna quit school say they r gonna take care of their child throw the child off on their moma and run around and still chase boys not me fo sho not me im 16 and my baby daddy is way older than me i dont even wanna have sex for a while i havent had it in a while dont want to dont need to ..i got better things to do lie my school work and go to work and take care of the one that comes first in my life my son Jeremiah Evan he is my world i went through so much trouble having him ....but he was worth it till this day i still have a big white bandage on my stomach from surgery on 1-8-09  where they cut n incison back open left it open to heal from the inside to out my mother has to change my bandage once a day and bathe me 4 to 5 times a week thats all for now because i cant get my incision moist yeah i went through alot of trouble glad ya posted this question...and yes i have cramps every time i bend over because of my incision is left open i bet this wil be the longest answer u get well have a nice day keep me in your prayers and i hope all is well for you|`|E5CnUdhsaa	id say after about 2 months i was all back together again and a bit less emotionally fragile lol|`|FgVvTnyOaa	It feels like a train has exited your body... at full speed.     At least it did for me. My son broke my tailbone coming out, and I tore. It is not fun. You don't don a bikini and take a walk down the catwalk, that's for sure! :)     There are several different things that can affect your recovery, how quickly you do and to what degree you are suffering. I would put mine on the high end of Painful recovery, while others are up and about almost immediately. If you decide to breastfeed, that could be a painful venture at first. It takes a few weeks to figure out, and your nipples have to be "broken in" lol. The uterus shrinking down does cause cramping, but nothing compared to childbirth. I have even heard of some women having orgasms during that cramping.. was not the lucky one there either !     In any case, do be prepared.. recovery is something else. I had thought the pain would end when the baby came out, but that was not the case!|`|dURFX4gOaa	i was very sore for a few weeks after but to be honest i was so busy with my baby girl i didn't really have time to think about it .|`|SjX72fPyaa	It felt really weird for me.

And I'm still feeling like I've gotten the best gift in the world...I hope that feeling lasts forever!|`|qZJIqZ5faa	depending on if you breastfeed or not...cramping can last until the locchia stops ( post labor bleeding) or if you breast feed, cramping is common for the next few weeks since the suckling sense brings on uterine cramps ( its tightening your uterus back up and pushing bad stuff out) ...some people if they have a c section have abdominal cramping for up to 8 weeks and trouble moving from a sitting to laying down position and visa versa.... every person and labor/surgery is different though....so results may vary so to speak :)|`|50BdfHuDaa	I had 2 children but I can only remember the 2nd one.  PAINFUL 6 weeks down there.  took me a week to walk slowly like an old great grandma.  It kinda feels like someone put a firecracker up there and lit it.  BOOM!!  I will never forget the experience of this birth.  I couldn't poop in fear I'd loose my stitches.  luckily my diet fixed that problem.  I had cramps for weeks.  that's just the uterus contracting back to normal size.  hurts more and longer after each birth though.    I recommend breast feeding. Helps ease the cramping/pain.  Your baby will have the best immune system and will help keep you out of the doctors office. I know from personal experience.  1st born was bottle fed and was always sick.  2nd one was breast fed and now 14 months and yet to get sick even though My whole family had the flu.  She got a runny nose and sneeze.  that all.  Breast is better.  Spread the word!!
LKIhUMCgaa	a neglectful parent is not a parent who works all the time, a neglectful parent is the parent who doesn't care bout his/her own child at all. i understand for a parent to work lots of hours to support his family, but when the parent comes home, does he pay attention to his child? does he help her w/ her homework? ask how her day was? does he take care of her if she's sick? is he willing to leave his work right away if he got a call from someone telling him his child has been rushed to a hospital or something? if yes to all, that's a parent right there...if no, then u got urself a neglectful parent. working lots of hours doesn't mean anything but him trying to provide the living for his child and make sure he can cloth her and feed her every day, a parent busting his a** off for 17 hrs a day just so his daughter could eat healthy, seems like a damn good parent to me...    i speak from my own experience, my own mother worked days and nights trying to support me and my brother, i barely ever saw her, but she made sure we had the food on the table and always had clean warm clothes, and i always saw her as the best mother any child could ever have, while my dad was home and didn't even notice me half the time. did my mom like working so much? she's still paying for it w/ her health problems, so i really doubt she worked so much just bc she felt like it...|`|ea207ed5b6ef75b8f1362932a6abf174aa	What exactly is the question, or is this just a statement of some sort?|`|ALDeXn6Uaa	time normally makes everything work out for the better.|`|uhj76Fkpaa	i'm sorry for this father cause I think he's more sad  than his daughter....what can I say?Life can be very cruel sometimes with humans...:(|`|E5CnUdhsaa	at that young age she doesnt understand why her father has to work so much, he sounds more upset doing it than she does...at the end of teh day hes doing it for her. and if he continues to show her love the way he is shell grow to respect him for trying to be better for her:)|`|46ddc6b6990fcd5b5d5e36dc7b533ccaaa	The point is what is worse? A life in a cheap home with the essentials but with a loving family or a life in a better neighbourhood with people you dont see and are not there to support and care for you as much as she could?|`|PQ7HYITBaa	True.  I grew up with a father who was always working and we never got really close so that distance stayed between us for the rest of my life. So When I had my daughters I promised myself I would be around more.    Now I work 14 hour days at the hospital and I only get to see my girls for an hour or two a day if I'm lucky.  I feel like a hypocrite and I am looking to go into private practice just so I might have more time with my kids.|`|GbrABQpXaa	it sucks. you wish things could be some much easier.  you have to work in-order for you guys to be well off. its sad for her because she wants her daddy. She will understand as she gets older, just keep on showing her as much affection as you can and she will know. it seems people give you crap for something you already know is going on , since your the one making that painful decision . others are not going to understand and judge cause they only know about themselves, and just assume their way is the only way.|`|uZnnCjJ0aa	dont have any kids if you do i will be happy to adopt but dont be thier parent
69DjSUVAaa	If she is sleeping well at night i would say she is getting enough during the day.    My son is just over six months old, his feeding routine is,   7am breastfeed  8am fruit puree (2-3 cubes)  11am breastfeed  11.30 -12pm veg puree(1-2 cubes)  2.30pm breastfeed  4.30pm veg puree (1-2 cubes) fruit puree(1-2 cubes)  6.30 breastfeed / bedtime  Then he can be up a couple of times a night to get more milk, (he doesn't always take big milk feeds during the day, but then he never has) He has had a 3-4 nights where he only woke once.    Good luck with you little one x|`|E5CnUdhsaa	you know i think what your doing sounds absolutely fine:) if you want to stop night time feeds then maybe a 10pm feed would suit you more. my daughter had a 10pm feed up iuntil around 6 months then she cut down onit after more solids were introduced.|`|IJ0xybVYaa	If her weight is ok, your doin fine, don't wake her at 10, just leave her go, if you wake her at 10 she will continue that for ages, so my advice just leave her be, if she is gaining weight, thats great. Don't change a thing. Well done your doin a great job.|`|50BdfHuDaa	I breastfed my daughter every couple of hours in the beginning.  Then every 4-6 hours.  My daughter did start sleeping through the night while she was a newborn.  Your routine is perfect.  If she happens to wake up feed her if shes hungry. I started giving her rice in a bottle with breastmilk at 3 months.  at 6 months start stage 1 baby food  if you haven't already.  include 1 serving of gerber juice for vitamin C.  My daughter weighed 9 lbs 2 oz at birth and now 14 months weighs 22 lbs. She is still breastfed.  She drinks cows milk too but she doesn't prefer it.|`|ExVvNU8taa	My daughter was breast fed until last month, 8 months old. She started sleeping through the night at 7 weeks. And at 6 weeks I started giving her rice cereal before her bed time BF time at 8pm.     At 5 months, this was what my daughter schedule was like:  BF 7 am  baby cereal then BF at 10 am   BF 2 pm  1/2 jar solid food veggie, small amount of baby cereal 5-6 pm  BF 8 pm, bed time    (Even now at almost 9 months, my daughters schedule is the same, except the BF is replaced with a bottle and the amount of solids is more and she has a "baby" snack during the day too)    You should try cereal or solids closer to bed time. It sounds to me like she could be waking up because her little tummy is hungry. Solids will help keep her full longer.     You could also try a relaxing bath and then story time right before you BF her and put her to bed.    Every baby is different so do what you feel is best you you and your daughter. Good luck!
Uy8ntukjaa	Go somewhere fun like an amusement park or have a pool party.|`|nV3euU7baa	Go to the movies|`|fvqXiBEVaa	Since you're 17, I assume you can drive. Drive to the beach and hang out with some friends or go to the movies.    If this helps. For my upcoming 16th birthday in one week (yay) I am (hopefully getting a car) but, I'm having at least four friends over, we're going to an early dinner, movies, and then we're going to be driven to a popular hang out called "The Walk" to hang out.
AXshzI0Kaa	I don't have a problem with it...in fact I have done it.     If I have a single man or woman apply to adopt and a child is placed with that parent....no where in the interview do I ask them their sexual preference.....gay, straight, bi, trans.....not my business. I would never know unless they told me or they were clearly in a realtionship|`|pwu9xzF8aa	i think that if parents r giving up their child to someone else, the agency should pick the adoptive parents- not the biological parents.  i think that child abandonment is a big deal 2day, and i think they need to make the adoption process easier!  i dont have a problem with gays and lesbians raising children! they r only human, the same as the rest of us, and can b just as effective parents.  good parenting doesnt happen as a result of sex, gender or race- it happens as a result of love. its 2009 now- time to stop descriminating against them now|`|2wyDALHgaa	As long as they qualify and have an earnest desire to help a child(ren) in need, I don't care about their orientation.  More power to em.  It's not for me but then again what they do like that isn't a concern of mine and I don't think it effects their ability to parent effectively.|`|RrgQUT5vaa	My wife and I have adopted 5 siblings from foster care and are in the process of getting guardianship of the 2 youngest siblings.  So as a gay mother of 7, I am for gay adoption!    The issues my children face are not from having two loving mothers, but from losing their first mother.  They have issues from being abused in every way possible and neglected.  The issues they face have nothing to do with us being gay.    If you play your cards right, Children's Division in some states will place children with gay families.  But it requires the couple to give up their "gay pride", so to say.  We were not obnoxiously out to anyone as foster/adoptive parents and walked away with the most beautiful blond haired, blue eyed children.  We worked hard to do the best thing for them and had a great relationship with their first mother.  But we definitely did give up a lot and almost didn't make it out together.    I think that alternative families should have every chance to be parents that any other couples would have.|`|3X4i5Whvaa	It is easier to adopt a child today than to be a single biological parent. Adoption is being promoted by the government. Agencies are springing up everywhere.    I am wondering, if, in a few years, biological families will be unheard of.    We seem to be getting there.    The USA is like the sci-fi movies of 30 to 40 years ago.|`|nESfk0bXaa	Tell you pals to adopt from foster care.    Oh, and adoption is about children's rights, not gay rights.|`|RKcwfrGOaa	Many people wish to adopt and cannot.  They're not being discriminated against.  Adoption is not a right.  Children are NOT commodities.  They are human beings.  They have rights of their own. The adoption process should limit its concern to the rights of the child.     Since the parents are the legal guardians of the child (and the child's rights), placement should be at their discretion.  If they want their child to be raised by asexual, green people who worship the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man, as long as the prospective parents are financially and emotionally capable of raising a child, that's where the child should be placed.  If they prefer married church people, then that's where the child should go.  If the natural parents transfer the responsibility of placement to an agency, placement of the child is at their discretion.      No one is entitled to someone else's child.  Again, children are not commodities.  The only way for an individual to assert their RIGHT to parent is to bear children.  Acquiring children by any other means is NOT a right.  You either convince the person placing the child that you are the best placement available for a particular child or you don't.|`|BTuFtui3aa	What consenting adults do in their own bedroom has no effect on whether they're good parents are not, so in my opinion, the sexual orientation of the prospective adoptive parents should not be an issue when it comes to policy. (If they match with a specific expectant mother, she has every right to choose whoever she wants, for any reason.)    As long as they're emotionally and financially stable, with clean criminal records and the ability to care for a child... just like anyone else who is allowed to adopt... it shouldn't matter if they're gay or straight.    A state or agency accepting or rejecting prospective adoptive parents should be based on factors that actually affect their parenting-- which sexual orientation does not.|`|P2yRAWiJaa	There are plenty of agencies that allow gay, non/different religious, and different races adopt.  As long as they can provide a stable, loving, forever home it doesn't really matter.    I shall keep my opinion about gays adopting to myself.

Very classic, yet not overused.|`|6710b87650d29aedb9ee3b4272d6af96aa	Evan, Ehren looks a bit like the girls name Erin.
NlOtwCqgaa	That would depend..    Where did the family live before the divorce?    If the family lived in Sweden, then they should follow the laws and court decisions of the country they lived in, so she should live with her mother.    If the family lived in the USA, then, just as above.. they should follow the laws and court decisions of the country they lived in, so she should live with her father.|`|23MPcnNqaa	Well being that we know nothing else about either parent, I would say which ever one has more time for the child and can give her the proper care she needs.|`|Fkl6gV8Qaa	You've asked this question before and obviously not happy with the answer. The reality is that it doesn't matter what country she is in, what matters is what parent treats her the way she should be treated. I don't agree that she should be kept from one parent unless there is a very good reason (ie: abuse of any nature). The answer you are looking for is not going to be hear, the answer is way more complicated then what Y!A can provide.
syrh8J6Vaa	I know it has happened but not to me personally.  Sometimes your body goes a little wacky and you may have ovulated late in your cycle.

hl5WdXnbaa	My parents stayed together for us kids... when they finally divorced all of us kids  said "thank god it is about time!".  I think I would rather be from a broken home than with 2 parents who hated each other and fought non stop. they did not share a room or even meals together.     I know a gay male couple who have adopted 12 kids. They are the best parents ever! The kids are so happy . I wish I could bottle up the joy in that house and spread it around.|`|F6lZHRkVaa	We could hold Obama up as an example of a child not always *needing* a nuclear family, sure. Kids can manage just fine with only one parent. BUT I bet you anything Obama wishes he had had a nuclear family. Just because he became a success story doesn't mean he was happy with his family life.     I still think a nuclear family is incredibly important and absolutely NOT overrated. That said, plenty of single parent homes turn out great kids. But we should never think that a single parent home is best for the children.     Fertility treatments and adoption is widely available to single parents. Most agencies gladly accept single's applications.|`|AkFag8tNaa	I agree that anyone is capable of making something (we all have different standards of success) of themselves regardless of background and I believe there are many types of family and one type does not trump the other however, I believe more of an effort should be made to bring children into the world when both the mother and father are ready. Single moms can be great moms (I was one for awhile) but it takes a lot more effort than someone who is married and has the support of a spouse. I also think that there are things both parents (male and female)bring to the parenting table.|`|afkygHMgaa	I absolutely agree with you. Good point|`|HVY2rqzfaa	Children need a secure environment, good healthy attachment to a primary care giver, respect, love and boundaries, how you achieve this can vary and no, you do not need to be a happy family in the traditional man and wife sense to raise a happy child.    In fact, staying together for the sake of the kids - who then grow up in a strained environment where their only experience of adult relationships is one of animosity will probably be far less happy than two separate but happy parents - or indeed just one.|`|prqrQcd1aa	I don't believe it to be "over rated" but i do believe that a single family structure is under rated.. let me explain.  I am single and live with a boyfriend and i have 3 kids that aren't his. We are not married but to others we may seem as if we are. I have raised children on my own and with him. Raising children on your own, with no help is not something easy, but it's not something that should be criticized either, especially if it is being done correctly.   I think we should put more emphasis on having the ability to care for children and offer then a loving, nurturing home. I think there is nothing wrong with single family structures or gays / lesbian couples adopting or having children in any way.. as long as they can offer the child what it needs!|`|426c7861dc77ee80668e47afb0150a53aa	I'm sorry but I thought, again I said I thought, that the stereotype which you speak of had long lost it's luster, but, then, again, I always seem to go against the grain and don't give a flying rat's azz what people think.  I was a single parent, no in-vetro crap, and I am still a single parent, my girls are grown and I have many friends female, male and sexual preference unknown (and really who gives a *****) who are loving individuals who have and who are raising affluent individuals in "non" traditional households.  "FAMILY" a group of humans that loves/cares/nurtures for one another as they love/care/nurture for them-self.  The Obamas just go to show that the "nuclear" family does still exist and we aren't too shocked when we see it and it is a total pleasure to observe.   God Bless.
G1K8NsBBaa	I've heard you could take it throughout the month, I bought it on tuesday, im takin one in the morning and one before going to bed. I've heard a lot of good thing about vitex, so im just gonna give it a try, you could so some research on yahoo answers, or try mothering.com forums. i was there yesterday and there is a lot of girls that got pregnant with vitex.
17ae94f98003e0b9fdcbfa3f8583e9f1aa	The pregnancy begins producing HCG once it implants.  So I would wait at least 2 to 4 days before doing an HPT once you have had implantation bleeding.  Its a little unusual to have implantation bleeding so late in the cycle, but stil within the normal range.|`|oOBg9hshaa	at least two weeks, good luck|`|eemmWU0Haa	Test now n good luck.
Jswomud7aa	Let's say you ovulated at day 16, two days later than average. It takes about 5 days for implantation to occur so that puts us at day 21 in your cycle which is a full week before the start of your next cycle.    So, maybe it's possible, but odds are against it.|`|jswhfzg8aa	Hi, I think anything is possible, sometimes women ovulate later than the usual 14 days after your period, every woman is different. I hate it when people say that you don't get early pregnancy signs before your period due, because I had early nausea, sore boobs etc before my period was even due, & I was pregnant. Thats why I don't believe everything is yes or no only, there are grey areas as well.  If your hoping to get pregnant I wish all the best.|`|aiAtILjraa	no.it 14 days after you period when you ovulate
dcf56421e83eed9e9b56a6265e62691daa	i would probably be sacred to tell someone but i would realize that if i don't say something to someone something worse can happen to me !!!!!!!!!!!!!!   anyways i really think you should tell a guidance counselor or a teacher if you aren't comfortable enough to tell your mom and if you don't want to talk to your teacher or counselor tell your mom's friends in confidence it really might help!!!!!!! SO PLEASE TAKE MY ADVISE AND TELL SOMEONE!!!!!!!!!!    good luck  ?Amanda?|`|bdcb099bef6ab23ff1a24e3df892b69caa	dont forget the hard decisions are usually the right decisions xxx|`|ff1da17913bbe4a4871ec0c1a0727c7aaa	you really need to talk to your mom, I think she will understand!!!!|`|AA11286626	If it's important enough, you should tell your mom.  Not knowing what it is limits me to saying anything else.  Good Luck|`|c5d95263d67985e977ee45f13d0a49deaa	tell especially if it's important then they can handle it jopefully|`|188fda227edd0e5dda2c493b80e9b783aa	Use better grammar because you mention the same thing 3 times.Anyway.. depends on what it was,but maybe not since i can't think of anything really bad that can happen to me at age 13.|`|d90f30286c4c3980e1603e1bf41cd0a2aa	Are you pregnant? Please email me, I'm 13 too! You don't have to, but if you wanna tell me, email me.|`|36629c24a394389070f2cb6ad21ed239aa	i would tell and your mom is goin to find out if you r using her account|`|13d2e11e5cf2ba44870b2f79efdac5f2aa	Well, if you mean rape, you need to tell your mom right away! You could get pregnant and it will be harder to explain later. She will be able to help you, but it won't help to keep this a secret. Can you be more specific as to what happened?|`|AA11720055	You need to talk to an adult especially your parents.  If you are not comfortable with this - Talk to your Teachers or someone at your Church or even the Police.  I hope all is well with you!|`|cf3aac9c5c7431e016ad938c243a85afaa	it depends.  if it's about your sister keeps eating your lucky charms and it's pissing you off, get over it.  if it's something substantial, you need to tell someone.|`|fdfadf7518da66e0a8ee57f31d1920f7aa	tell your mom or a school counsler or moms friend maybe could sit down with you while you tell your mom, good luck sweetie|`|6679a0e1a04651bbad7bd9d492d7b513aa	You should really tell someone and sooner rather than later.|`|eefeb358067c1102661a772dcfa271bfaa	Sweetie. By using her account, you are asking her to find out. I am sure she loves you and will love you regardless of the news. Talk to your mom. The sooner, the better. I hope that everything works out for you. You are in my prayers.
lKof1n0Xaa	Mila is a girl name. My niece is named Mila. I wouldn't worry about it too much if it did turn out to be used more for boys, because a girl having a boy's name is pretty cute and kind of 'edgy' (sorry, I hate that word) - in any case a girl who has a boy name is better than a boy with a girl name.|`|2AhcNaBzaa	I think it sounds like a girl name it's pretty and most names that end in a sound more femanan|`|5ZvALiclaa	I like it and I thought 'girl' straight away. Don't worry about others, choose what you like and they'll just have to lump it!|`|0fffe2e7ff7dc3c97a1c8297a89babd2aa	If i hear someone calling "Mila" i ll think he is calling a girl for sure!  Milana is very nice to cut it out!!!  I like Milena also!! Comes from Emily and Helena|`|uhj76Fkpaa	definetely girl name|`|WmIU5pSRaa	It's more a girl's name, I think. And a beautiful name at that!|`|YO1w7gpiaa	According to www.babynames.com    Mila is 100% female name|`|ype5N1qEaa	Girl definitely|`|YseGAHIfaa	Mila for a girl & Milo for a boy x|`|57X92zknaa	It's a girl's name, definitely.|`|7rIAd6gGaa	I would definitely say it's a girl's name. Boys names don't typically end in a. That's a feminine ending. Congrats and good luck!|`|qUV0xKu9aa	definatley  a girls name very pretty|`|qZJIqZ5faa	i think it sounds like a girl name...very pretty|`|DSMaUGQYaa	It sounds pretty girly to me, especially with the "a" part at the end.. I think it sounds very feminine and is a lovely choice. Look at Mila Kunis... she's beautiful!|`|aTlpDt84aa	It sounds like a girl's name-definately not masculine!|`|2EAipG23aa	its more like a girls name :)|`|PSaXvIyWaa	it's a girls name  I don't know if I like Milana but I do like Mila|`|fAr9qSmQaa	Sounds like a girl name to me!!

2JTtd1z5aa	Adorable!!! I love it!! :D|`|Elxuvon8aa	sorry I thought of Black saliva|`|SMjHwYvcaa	gotta get rid of the middle name    loving the first name|`|O3i7zJB2aa	I think its a lovely name.  I think the first and middle names go well together because they have some of the same letters, its like a pattern within the two names.  And I think often when the last name is fairly common, like quinn, its nice to have a more unusual first name. (or vice versa)|`|bPd1RsxDaa	I think it's very interesting, cute, and creative.  Congratulations, by the way :)|`|cErLq7f3aa	i don't like it|`|Kf9SoNmoaa	I kind of like Salvadora, but I don't like Raven.|`|7qAlZRHmaa	Sladora would sound better Cute Name though  or Salvandora|`|NHLN4ARxaa	not so fond of Raven. how do you pronounce the middle name?|`|KcfBOa9vaa	Love Raven    Not liking Salvadora.    With Quinn as her last name I think it would be better if you chose a first name that doesn't also end in 'N'.    Good luck!|`|jgtfWjE4aa	raven is a beautiful name  although i know a girl and she made it not so beautiful haha   salvadora, hmm that is different.  but listen, this is your baby! don't let anyones opinion affect your decision.   quinn is a cool last name :)    quinn is actually a good idea for a baby boy, if that's what we have. we find out next month    so thanks you gave me a name suggestion haha|`|oX1JTGjraa	I like Raven... Is she of Salvadorian decent...  That's what Salvadoran means.    By the way, pronouncing it that way... Sell.va.dora... that sounds like selva.dora.. which in spanish means golden jungle.|`|0CRFklLraa	im sorry but i do not like it AT ALL!  please do not name you child that.  i already gave you a list of middle names on your other question about the name raven quinn|`|AA11540749	come up with something a little bit more creative!
2JTtd1z5aa	Sal- vah - door- uh    Sah- deer- uh    Cute names, & good luck!|`|dnGJ5JLgaa	Salvadora is prounonced as it is spelt:  (Sal-va-dora)    and Sadira to me looks like  (Sa-deer-ah)    hope i helped!

That's Salvadora, so it turns out to be {sal-vuh-door-uh}.    [suh] as in the "vuh" in Salvadora or the "luh" in love just with an s at the front, [deer] as in the words "deer" or "dear", and then [uh], like the end of Salvadora or the end of the word "media". So it's {suh-deer-uh}.|`|7qAlZRHmaa	sal like sally (sal- va- dora )  sad like sand without the N _sad-ira ) like iris
5JtvVvCOaa	Since you already have gotten your period in that cycle it's *highly* unlikely you are pregnant.    It's probably more likely stress that has caused you to miss this period. Stress can really do that.  Of course it is better to take a test ASAP to put your mind at ease, because the stress of worrying about a possible pregnancy will probably delay it even further!    For future reference; it's best to take the emergency pill within 20 hours after intercourse otherwise the protection drops dramatically.  Even better is getting on a regular contraceptive like the pill or the coil etc, then you won't have this stress again!    And of course, before you get intimate with a guy using this method, make sure he gets tested cos you won't be protected against STDs.|`|TWKtVcKcaa	if u got ur period after being intimate u r not pregnant. it mite be somthing else u shud tlk to ur doctor|`|r39EDGhPaa	Plan b is only 85% effective.    You could be PREGNANT, not preggers.|`|df56ca79f426d12c4a6737af42e04037aa	you're probably not pregnant, unless you've had unprotected sex recently.  take a preggers test and find out.|`|fFgBnFT3aa	I think you should take a pregnancy test and/or see your doctor hun|`|8uVGPhqYaa	okay hunn, you never get "preggers", its PREGNANT. and idk. good luck.|`|EXhVHMAlaa	There is always a chance of pregnancy when you have intercourse.    The only way to be sure is to take a at home test.  Even those aren't 100% effective so see a doctor.    Get birth-control, it helps prevent pregnancy, and also use condoms, to prevent STD's.  This will help this situation from (hopefully) occuring again.  Good luck.  God bless.
bT4npA7Jaa	Khloe or Chloe are the best, in my opinion. It would be too hard to write and spell and all that with the little marks above it. And Cloe and Kloe are too plain :)|`|Q6LPNIpVaa	Kloe or Khloe|`|Elxuvon8aa	I really do not like the name or Zoey have had to many people in the extended family with dogs by those names.  Khole Kirdashion's is the best spelling to me|`|QWTLw9DEaa	I love Chloe  It is the correct way to spell it|`|4fIE3Eb2aa	Chloe |`|xhVe918waa	Chlo|`|qm2jrU1Vaa	Chloe is my favorite.|`|kBek6QCLaa	Chlo?|`|6bb5ab1593f2bb3b53c4348de44e9d3caa	What does it matter?

But in the end it is up to you.|`|7H4fhrEOaa	Chloe.  Cute name by the way.|`|VKXNWcbGaa	I personally liked Khlo but How did you type French accent marks on your computer. I have asked, but no one knew. That accent mark on the e is called accent aigu in French.|`|AONXdcOPaa	Chlo is nice :3|`|WVVdf4ILaa	Chlo?|`|dlQEa6Y0aa	I like Chloe!! hands down!|`|z1YM1Xniaa	Chloe|`|d6e11chxaa	Only Chloe or Chlo?. Chlo is the French form, but it looks silly to me. It should never ever ever be spelled with a K! It just looks tacky and trendy and it just lacks class with a K.|`|xLmtXZJ0aa	Cloey  chloe  Chloey  chloee    sorry but k is tacky|`|61NKzPzMaa	Chloe    All the rest are trashy & ugly. Although Chlo? isn't that bad.|`|0CRFklLraa	Chlo?  Chlo  Chloe    Either of these three. Chloe spelled with a 'K' is just tacky.    zoe|`|XwUge137aa	I like Chloe the best.|`|JHV3dOOiaa	Chlo is cute....i like the e..haha|`|93b7b24cc4b3ba428911ea6130ff091aaa	i like Chloe.|`|Yz1pzloSaa	I like Chloe best. Chlo would be pronounced "Clo-ey"...lol. I also think it's easier to not have two little dots above the e. Like, if you had to type your name on the computer it wouldn't be as simple because there is no ? key.    I also think it's prettier if it starts with a C than a K.
szVvf7Nkaa	It's not hard to see that her boss was able to sweep her of her feet. And that is why she wants to be with him. But this is not a relationship that is going to last. Your ex will get hurt by her boss because those types or relationship never lasts.     You seemed surprise that she broke off with you even after you had sex. I think that you honestly believed that if you had sex with her that it was a guarantee that she would never leave you.  But I imagine that now you realize that having sex with someone does not confirm that you have a strong relationship with that person.    You said that you don't know what girls really want from boys. Well they want the same thing that boy wants from girls. They want to be happy in the relationship that they have. But sometimes people are not meant to be together. And relationships don't always work out. In your case your ex didn't love you enough to stay with you. And there is nothing you can do about that. But there is one thing you can do you and that is for you to move on. Go out with your friends and have a good time. And keep yourself busy all the time so that way you don't have time to think about her. Eventually you will meet other girls and you will be okay.|`|oQTjeOekaa	just tell her how you feel, and try to understand what she is going through as well...
YFPMcHCbaa	None of the people on here will be able to tell you if you're pregnant. All the symptoms you get during pregnancy can also be associated with something else.    Go to the doctor, take a test, or do some research. There are so many different places to get great information on the web.    babycenter.com  pregnancy.org  pregnancy.com  americanpregnancy.org  webmd.com/baby  pregnancy360.com  fitpregnancy.com  surebaby.com  pregnancytoday.com  pregnancy-calendars.org|`|1CryEnb3aa	Sounds like a normal period coming to the end.  If you are unsure, take a test.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	You are not pregnant. You had a period. Pregnant women don't have periods.|`|MeYILJeSaa	...It sounds like a period.  They usually taper off at the end and get lighter. I doubt you're pregnant if it was that heavy.|`|7vu3M1YFaa	I think you are safe - periods always become lighter towards the end of a period. I too come on heavy, sometimes very heavy, but between days 5-7 i am only on very light.    However, if this is unusual for you, after all only you know your own body, then I would go see a Dr and get a test done.|`|xxuUJFJ1aa	No way are you pregnant. It's VERY VERY unlikely.
SfdTlJ6Vaa	They were spot on with mine. They said girl.. and thats what i got =D|`|AA10781209	I have never had an ultrasound to determine the sex of my baby. I am a man, and therefore, I have never been pregnant. But thanks for asking!!!|`|f50f6a665c054d5ffd525f5a31663073aa	they said boy and i had a boy|`|pgQnY7tLaa	id say very accurate becuase usually the ultasound scan to detemine the sex is usually at 20weeks... mine was at 20weeks and they got the sex right...a boy :-)
0OTV0a4Zaa	i found out i was having a girl at my 12 week scan,they measured the genatlia tube.at my 19 week scan they confirmed it was still a girl. the further along you are the more accurate it is.  good luck.|`|iq5uwobOaa	An ultrasound is perhaps the most common way to detect the sex of your baby. With an ultrasound, you can probably not detect the sex of yore baby until sometime between week 16 and week 20 of pregnancy. Having said that, there are a great many factors that go into how early you can detect the sex of your baby using an ultrasound. Everything from gestational age to the thickness of the mother's abdominal wall can affect the amount of time that this process will take. An ultrasound is, after the 20th week of pregnancy, generally more than 90% accurate at being able to tell a baby?s sex.|`|uZnnCjJ0aa	i can explain it a bit more personally just email me if you want me to   i will be happy to help with this sort of problem!|`|prqrQcd1aa	All 3 of mine were accurate!|`|2N4j1ficaa	in less the babys got its legs shut and guessing  very accurate hun|`|f98ecf3f5dd8f9c4fb1b97facf100a2aaa	When I was pregnant with my twins, they told me I was having girls at my 19 week ultrasound and they were right!   I think it's pretty accurate unless the baby has their legs tightly closed!|`|C22jeMVhaa	100% wrong. The docs told me I was having a boy until the day my daughter was born.|`|5ZvALiclaa	both of mine were spot on...we had 2 boys both determined at 18-19 week scan    these days they are right much more often than they are wrong but there is still that possibility|`|SaRDq9iLaa	I was told I was having a girl and I did.  I think the ultrasound machines are pretty accurate now a days!  Good luck!|`|XWPAjxsGaa	At my 18 week ultrasound they said i was having a boy..   Im 36 weeks now and had an ultrasound today and i got them to double check it was a boy and it is so yea there accurate!  But like everything they can still make mistakes.    Congratulations!
d0a478287f532cea93062e6751a249aaaa	I haven't seen any online programs, but I did see an infomercial one day that peaked my interest since I have a 4 month old.|`|I4KqAZThaa	There are some very excellent programs which teach a baby to read. they are convenient, really helpful and professionally designed in such a manner so that maximum learning can take place.     ABabyCanRead is one of the bestselling online programs which can teach your baby to read.
f66ce5d864eadcad29348fd4a9871771aa	my husband is 29 and he doesnt always respond to his name either lol. i wouldnt worry too much  my 1 year old does the same way, sometimes if they arent in the mood its just hopeless, my son has learned to do a "high 5"...but for the life of me he wouldnt do it fo nana the other day, then turn right around and do it for his ther grama lol. dont worry though, its just what they do  :0)|`|1s3nddaYaa	my son doesn't answer by his name all the time either, he just ignores me. my son doesn't wave hey but waves bye. dont worry your son is doing fine|`|780ByZVEaa	Not at all, my son is almost 2 and doesn't always listen when we call him (men have selective hearing from very young hahaha) No your boy is just to busy to be distracted. the bye bye waving thing it will come just keep showing him and at the right times so he knows when to use it!!  Boys tend to be a little slower then girls, doesn't mean they are dumber they just like to take their times and not rush|`|dPyfP0ijaa	Don't pay attention to the milestone marks and certain ages he "should" hit them.    All babies are different, they each develop at their own pace.    If you are concerned his hearing might be off, you should get him tested.  Check and see if he responds when he sees you or if you are loud enough to hear your voice vibrations. If he responds to his name when he can't see you (stand behind him and call him) he should be fine.      My kids are 9 and 7 and they rarely respond to their names if they're watching tv.
5793e96405109506ce7e9f6a4ff6ce46aa	first answer is right!! the best solution for you would be a sling! so baby can feel secure and you can have ur hands free for ur 2 yrs old !  i like the moby wrap :)  good luck!!|`|Y8kjVeLyaa	He's 3 weeks old...they want to be picked up! So what if he is only crying for that reason? That is very normal...he will be getting dissatisfied with spending his time in his basket because he is developing and becoming more aware...he will spend less and less timne in it and that is good...get a bouncy chair and put him in that sometimes...or a play ring....let him lie on a blanketon the floor with some interesting things hanging nearby....he SHOULD know that if he cries you will pick him up...that is what builds their confidence////he is just too old now to lkeave iin a basket most of the day.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	A 3 week old baby does not have the mental capacity to cry for attention or to be picked up. It's ok to let him cry a little but he's a newborn. Hold him when he cries. It's around 6 monthish that they start the crying for attention thing.    But to reiterate a 3 week old baby DOES NOT have the mental capacity to play mind games like that. :) Not at all.|`|rISHTfK3aa	No he is not to young. We can program our children even as young as this age. Bad habits can be started so you need to be careful you dont start one off by picking your baby up every time he cries.|`|xp0BnsD0aa	My maternal health nurse says that if you tend to your baby whenever they cry when young, they will develop trust that you are there to protect them and nurture them.  This will make them more self sufficient in the future.  You cannot 'spoil' a child with attention - that went out in the 80's.|`|5ZvALiclaa	hes totally normal, he just wants you because its comfy and smells good and its a total pain in the butt i know!    do you use a dummy? this could help keep him settled as may an electric swing that is covered with your nightie or tshirt.|`|nhgQKvwEaa	Lady, come on.  Sorry to be so blunt, but do you know how stupid it sounds when someone says "My 3 week old is only crying because he wants to be picked up" Your child is only 3 weeks old. He is crying for a reason. And just because you have a two year old that gets "jealous easy" shouldn't make you stop picking your baby up. That's just something your 2 year old is going to have to get used to. He is a newborn hun, his needs must be tended to. He is crying for a reason. He is way too young to be spoiled, and way too young to be left alone to cry.|`|46ddc6b6990fcd5b5d5e36dc7b533ccaaa	Babies that young dont cry for no reason!!! Even if its just he is not feeling secure.... Try swaddling him, or putting something that smells like you in the cot with him. (tshit etc something you have worn) so he can still smell you! It will take time for you to find something that makes him feel comfortable in there but you'll find it eventually!!!    Id say thats his problem|`|HIdyWuQGaa	I would agree that he is a little too young to be purposely crying for you to pick him up but also understand your situation. You are right to be thinking you can not just hold him all day. Maybe he does not like lying flat so does he maybe have a little comfy seat/bouncy chair. It could be that he has a little wind as that would possibly hurt more lying down. If that does not work then to ensure you are still getting bits done and spending time with 2 year old you could try one of those baby carriers that you strap to you, a friend of mine used to do that a lot with her little one who was very restless.|`|WzKrZoHQaa	It maybe he has wind - even if you are breastfeeding he will still get it so do burp him after every feed.  You know yrself if you have indigestion laying flat makes it worse.  He is just 3wks old - I couldn't put mine down for first 8 wks.  Babies cry for several reasons it is their only means of comms.  Yr 2 yr old sounds more problematic than yr baby - he has to learn he is no longer top dog and the baby needs his attention too - engage him in trying to help, ask him to draw a picture for the baby and start a scrap book of his masterpieces but you cannot not pick up a new baby cos yr 2 yr old is very jealous !!     Pick the little mite up and cuddle him for heavens sake - he's a new born.  You can get a front carrier and still go about yr daily business as MANY do.|`|50BdfHuDaa	check for colic.  maybe it's gas.  my baby had gas all the time.  maybe he's hungry.  They eat constantly that young.  every couple of hours.  pain in the butt when you got another child to take care of.  lucky for me my first born is 8 years older than my second.  he is the best big brother helps me out a lot and doesn't mind being in the backseat for attention.|`|P25GuvNjaa	I have been reading the answers you have received and I agree with them, he just wants to be close to you.  I will shortly have a 2 year old and a newborn and have a plan of action!  My son is going to continue to go to nursery but only for half days (he loves it!) so I can have one on one with the baby without my boy getting left out and I am going to get a sling for when he is at home with me so the baby wont be getting left out, I just hope it all works out as well as I hope!  Why dont you try getting a sling?|`|LQminEIEaa	Its hard for a toddler when a new baby arrives, my daughter was 25mths when my second daughter arrived and she became jealous and anxious almost immediately. Maybe try to make some time out for mummy and daughter play time and make it extra special, very hard to do with a new baby but from my experience it was necessary to reassure my daughter that she was loved and the new baby hadn't taken any of that away.  I hope these links might help you with some settling ideas and toddler ideas.  Good luck, it does get easier.|`|WQR0KEqZaa	hi, my baby girl is  4 weeks old and cries alot of the time when shes awake if i put her in her bouncy chair after 2 mins she cries i think at that age they need reassurance and cuddles, this is my 4 th baby i think when you have other children to divide your time with its hard and you notice more than if its your first how much time you spend holding your newborn.  but they will grow out of it as they get bigger you can distract them more with rattles and play gyms etc.  good luck
k9RXrzluaa	I used to have a shih tzu and I got her when she was just 8 weeks old. What my mom and I did was get one of my really large stuffed toys (a very hairy cat) and we had one of those old-fashioned alarm clocks and tucked it in under the stuffed toy. I read that this mimics the puppy's mom's heartbeat, and we didn't hear any cries or whines from our puppy and she would snuggle up to the stuffed toy.|`|AA11111862	Well, I guess some people consider a puppy to be their babies & toddlers. lol.   but, maybe you can try putting him outside your bedroom . Maybe if he wakes & doesn't see you he may go back to sleep.

Good start is going to either be milk based and soy based and you have already tried it once. The problem is not the formula if you are using the hypoallergenic kind. There is something else. Nutramigen is just so very very sensitive and made for very sensitive baby tummies. If you are to switch maybe switch to allimentum,same hypoallergenic type of formula, but a different brand.(Similacs brand) But, something isn't right and I would get a second opinion.|`|50BdfHuDaa	did your doc check for acid reflux.  my daughter had it.  prescribed prevacid for it.  maybe your baby has a sensitivity to the formula.  try soy.  If that doesn't work then buy fenugreek seeds and start producing breastmilk for your baby.  after all it is the best for a baby.  I should know My first born was formula fed and was always sick.  I decided not to go through this again and breastfed my 2nd and she has never been sick at all even though the rest of us got knock off our feet with the flu.  She never got it even though I was breastfeeding her through it all.|`|TkJmj97Daa	I would either try Cow and Gate Comfort milk stage 2 it is a great milk for unsettled tummies I know a quite a few people who had babies being sick or just uncomfortable with tummy ache and they switched to comfort milk.  My little boy use to scream constant when he was a few months old and it helped quite alot. Or my other suggestion would be maybe milk dont suit him full stop my toddler is now nearly 2 years old and even though comfort settled him quite alot his always had problems with milk.  His now on cows milk and if he has to much he gets and sore bottom or he has tummy ache I dont think milk suits all children.

3F8f1SoQaa	it is possible that he has some form of autism, but there is a chance that he does not. You do know he has a speech delay, so I would deal with that for right now.     my 3 year old son only said 10 words at 18 months old...and STILL only said 10 words at 24 months old. I was concerned at 18 months, but the doctor said to "give him time...boys are slower at speech", so I did. At 24 months it was obvious that he had a delay, but the doctor said NOTHING. I knew it was not right. That same day I came across a flyer for free developmental evaluations through our county early intervention program. I got him in the following week. I knew he had a speech delay, so I was not shocked when they told me that he had failed the speech portion of the screening. They sent him to a speech therapist who said he was speaking at a 15 month old level, and that he has verbal apraxia. The SLP started seeing him for an hour a week. Within 4 months he was signing 50+ words and saying 50+ words, and starting to speak in short sentences. Within 6 months of starting therapy he had a vocabulary of over 150 words and was speaking in full sentences. After just 9 months of therapy we had trouble getting him qualified for special needs preschool...he just barely made it. As of 2 weeks ago ( almost 12 months of therapy) he is now age appropriate with articulation problems. He is just over 39 months old.    apraxia is what my son has. the easiest way to dsecribe it is that he has the same issues that some stroke victims have. His "speech center" is damaged. he knows what he wants to say, but his brain cannot get the message to his mouth to move the correct way. he has virtually no vertical or lateral tongue movement ( and he is not tongue tied). he even has trouble making his lips do things like pucker. Through his therapy we are training his brain and mouth to do what they need to do.    The best thing for you to do is to call early intervention in your area. your local WIC clinic, health department, or elementary school should be able to give you the contact info. they will ask you what your concerns are and evaluate him in a bunch of different areas. They will let you know what areas are a concern and what the therapy options are. Here in Ohio they do not even ask for financial info...I got 9 months of speech therapy, and like $700 worth of therapy tools for my son for free. when he was going to turn 3 they helped me get him into special needs preschool. Beetlemilk is correct about doing the PDD assessment on childbrain. You can print it out and take it to his early intervention screen so you can use it as a discussion tool.  If he is on the autism spectrum then he will get tthe therapy that he needs early, and that is what will help him live up to his full potential. having a child on the spectrum can be trying, but it is not a death sentence...my 13 year old was diagnosed with PDD 2 years ago.|`|rdpZrBc9aa	If he has had high fevers in the past, get his hearing tested by an audiologist.    Good luck!|`|aJTBF7opaa	Dont obsess, if at this point the doctor is only worried about speech then go with that and persue that, other things such as occupational therpy may come in to play later on but  let it happen and the proffesionals figure it out. I waited untill my son was 2 to ask the pediatrcian reguarding my sons speech. I wish i had done it sooner but kept thinking he would catch up, he is 3 1/2 still has issues but is improving greatly with his therapist help. She also recommended occpational therapy and at first it concerned me, but after sitting in on the evaluation i am comferted to know that there are just a few things he needs help with, and that with the therapy he will get the help he needs. Step by step remember, a mothers concern is always greater then it needs to be, thats why there are proffesionals out there to help guide us.  Good luck|`|dPyfP0ijaa	Autism is a big possibility with what you are describing. Don't freak out, at least you are accepting the possibility.    I have a friend who's son is almost 3 . . maybe 3 by now and she refuses to thing her son is Autistic, I've worked with autistic children and I know he is. He doesn't say a single word.    There's a good chance that your son is just a slow developer. He could just be one of those quiet observers.     Just go to the specialist and no matter what the outcome, you've been blessed with a special little angel. There are hundreds of support groups out there for Autism. I can help you find some in your area and online.|`|xXMWNjb9aa	My son is now 30 months and only at about 24 months did he really start showing improvement. We had people come and access his speech at 16 months because he was behind. he would say "da" for everything but now he has started to put little sentences together that of course only us as parents can fully understand but the doctors also mentioned that if the child isn't speaking so a stranger can understand them by 3 then you should really get it checked out again. My son was always really sharp when he was unable to speak. he could follow 2 step directions and do all the hand eye coordination tasks that were age appropriate it was just his speech that was putting him behind. just give it time, every one develops at their own pace and i thought my son may have been autisic, alot of our family thought so too. but we just waited it out and everyday there were minor improvements. good luck|`|mx3gFmIKaa	I've got two sons like this, both dx with atypical autism.  My now 8 year old, talks normally, has friends, is in a regular classroom you really wouldn't know, but at 2-3-4yrs he was clearly different.  My 3 yr old its apparent he is different.  The best thing I did was stop vaccinating, that helped the most.  Early intervention is great, try to get him to qualify for as much as possible while its free and it makes so much of a difference especially before 3.    Here is a good PDD assessment:  http://www.childbrain.com/pddassess.html      50-100 mild PDD  100-150 moderate PDD    My oldest son scores betw a 46-52  my 3 yr old scores an 87    the scores change over time, its important to know its not static  neither of my sons made sounds at all at 18 months my 3 yr old can repeat phrases now at 3 but has limited functional speech, I am confident he will talk

Kids that age can decide to not like someone because one time she was playing with the red Play-Doh.  My daughter disliked people for the craziest reasons...lol.  After speaking with her you might decide her dislike of the other child is really something trivial.  My daughter is in 2nd grade and earlier this year she didn't like a girl in her class.  After I discussed friendship, sharing, etc with her she began to accept the girl and they are very good friends now (and this friend is one I LIKE TOO)!  Now, if the other girl is a biter, hitter, bully, etc than perhaps you could just be honest in your answer and say "Katie doesn't want too and after I discussed it with her she said your daughter has hit her before.  Perhaps we could get them together as adults and help them work out their issues.  This could help you find out if this family is one you want you and your daughter to associate with!

Be safe and best wishes|`|5JtvVvCOaa	Since you've taken the emergency pill within 24 hours it's *highly* unlikely you're pregnant and probably stress is making you miss your period!    That said, pulling out is a really bad method of contraception cos there is usually some sperm in precum and it only takes one of those little guys to get you pregnant. To put it into perspective, when a guy ejaculates he releases millions of sperm and it only takes one... so it's not a method I would advise using again.    Get on some regular form of contraception like the pill or coil, then you won't have this unnecessary stress again!    Probably no point taking a home test now because they generally don't work if you only had the unprotected sex a few days ago.  I'd wait till the 11th or 12th and if nothing then go see your doctor.
27fcbd4a2b0b4c5a2c64b68f6be0547faa	To be adopted - a child must lose their mother, father and entire family.    Their life starts out a little messed up.    And they have NO say in it.    To compound matters - sadly - sometimes some adoptees end up with adoptive parents who won't allow their adoptees to ever even talk about their first family or their adoption - and pretend that they never existed before they got adopted.    Adoptees don't fall from trees - and they need to have understanding for what they have been through - to get where they are.    It can be tough growing in a house full of genetic strangers - that have no looks or talents like your own.   Sometimes it can make you feel like a bit of a freak.    I hope this has given you some insight into adoptees.  It doesn't matter if anyone thinks that they're life is better than it could have been - no one can ever predict what could have been - but really - that's up to an adoptee to feel for themselves.  It matters that 'real' kids (non-adopted kids) don't tell adoptees how they should feel - especially if they have never experienced it themselves.  As for your cousin - he may well be fine with it.  But remember - that many many adoptees don't tell anyone how they really feel - as they are sometimes worried that they'll be judged - or told that they're ungrateful.  I didn't find my voice until I was in my 30's.  I love my adoptive family dearly - but my adoption didn't have to happen (my mother was sent to another state and told that she would be a bad mother) - and I missed out on growing up with the family I look and act like.|`|8Qxb7OZOaa	Adoption isn't a walk in the park for kids even for those that were adopted at birth.

Its important that society takes notice in the behavior of children.....if something is going on, it should be addressed.|`|5f52c5c3d1d0deab80192fb888e39e9aaa	I'm adopted, and I can always tell when someone is without them telling me, whether they're happy adoptees or not.  Over the course of my life, I've known about 20 adoptees. I won't lie, I don't like the term "messed up", but I've known some that would probably fit in that category.      My ex-boyfriend from high school was adopted, and was presumably happy with being adopted.  (At least he didn't want to talk about the fact that he was adopted, and was overly reliant on his mom.) He would paint himself white and pretend that he was a vampire when he was at school.  This guy wasn't ugly or anything, he just didn't know how to interact in a positive manner.    Another girl I know was probably molested by her adoptive father.  She literally will randomly reach up guy's shorts or jump on them and kiss them on the mouth right in front of her boyfriend. (She did this to my husband while I was standing right there.) She's 19 now, and definitely has problems. I have more stories of people I know, but it would take too long.    So here's the reason: it's not that adoptive parents don't love their children like their own, it's that adopted children experienced a loss that is very difficult for anyone else to understand. Imagine if your mother had died when you were so little that you couldn't remember it, and then you were raised without any information about her. In fact, you have a new mom and feel guilty whenever you think about the mother you lost. Then imagine that you found out that your mom didn't actually die, she gave you away.  To your mind, that means that she didn't want you. That rejection follows a person in ways that they don't even realize, so they act out.     Try to be understanding of adoptees with problems. Most of the time, their adoptive parents love them, they were just very hurt at a very young age and probably don't realize that they have a problem.|`|RrgQUT5vaa	I don't know that I agree with your assessment.  I think that adopted children can be as normal as others and adopted parents can love their adopted children like they would biological children.    Adoption has life consequences, that is true.  It can be emotionally trying for adopted children to find their way in this world because they have a harder time finding their own identity.|`|hD8qZMNcaa	Teenagers are odd in general. I know about 5 people at my school who were adopted, and they act less messed up than so many other people. Not to say they neccesairly ARE less "messed up" they're just better at hiding it.     Goodness gracious, how big is your school? That's a lot of adopted people.|`|355b8dca4624a65380892a4d414c9d3faa	If you got to know "these people" as well as you know your cousin then you'd probably realize they are no different than anyone else.|`|P2yRAWiJaa	Have you ever considered what these kids have gone through?    They could have been beaten, sexually abused, seen their parents drugged out or drunk all the time, watched dad kill mom (or vise versa) or had mom/dad die.  They have had a lot of loss and with that comes a lot of grief, anger, aggressiveness, shyness, emotional scaring, etc.  So yes, they may be "messed up" but it has NOTHING to do with their adoptive parents.  The people that adopted them are helping to normalize their life so people like you don't think they are "messed up" and so they don't feel "messed up".|`|ekz0N5Deaa	Try to think about it this way.....    When you were a baby and you cried, someone came to comfort you, feed you, or change you. When you were good, people were happy and smiled. When you were naughty, you were told that you were doing wrong. Many children who end up being adopted had mixed signals when they were babies. When they cried, no-one bothered, when they were hungry, no-one fed them. They were never taught right from wrong. They were abused, whatever they did. They were rarely shown affection or love.    These children received mixed signals when they were developing. Their only strategy was to 'switch off'. They learned that self-preservation meant keeping out of the way.     No matter how wonderful the adoptive parents may be, and we love our children as much as we would love a birth child, the damage was done long before we came along, and we can only hope to repair some of it.    Don't look on these children as 'odd' or 'messed up'. They need to belong, they need to improve their low self esteem, and they need friends.|`|EPIELNBuaa	i noticed that too in school, the adopted kids were always the weird ones lol    then i found out i was adopted! haha    but im a very insensitive person, and i was very unorthodoxed    id personally like to do some deep research into this.|`|9Ng5sqpnaa	I am a mother who lost her only child to adoption because I was young and still in school when I became pregnant. I can only tell you that after reuniting with my son, he told me that he had problems in school and began getting into fights when he was about 4 years old. I spoke with his adoptive mother about this and she confirmed that they told him he was adopted around 4 years old and that up until that point he had been easy going and the smartest kid in their neighborhood.     She denied however, that his being adopted had anything to do with his beginning to act out at that age. She told me they took him to a child psychologist who told them that adopted kids are exactly like biological kids. She still denies that adoption had anything to do with his many issues in life.    There are many people even in the mental health community that do not understand what an infant that loses their mother goes through. Even on a preverbal level, they experienced that loss. Often they have abandonment and trust issues because they don't understand why their first mother left them. What was wrong with me?     I think for that reason many adopted kids do a lot of testing of people around them. Sometimes it's by pushing people away because they're afraid if they get too close someone else will leave them.|`|FI1ZPsnsaa	I think it depends on the age of the child when they were adopted. a baby would have no reference point as to what it felt like the last time he saw his mom or dad and whether or not they were loved by there parents. If they grow up knowing they were adopted and it was what was  in there best interest and they have felt loved there whole life, they are less likely to be "messed up". Unless there were drugs or alcohol used during pregnancy; that's an entirely different circumstance; which can effect the child's brain during development. and if the child's primal needs were met just after birth.      I adopted my son at an older age (4). I had him as a foster child first; then when his parent couldn't comply with the law; the judge severed the parents parental rights and put him up for adoption. My son now eight remembers child protective services removing him from his parents. He remembers the police taking his parents off to jail. He had been found wondering the streets in search of food; while they were blacked out somewhere on drugs. He remembers them not showing up for there visitations. He was put in survival mode and learned not to trust adults for love,protection or security. His primal needs were never met. He didn't know where his next meal was going to come from. There are many "unorthodox" behaviors that come from this, such as hording; detachment from loved ones; sabotaging friendships to test how strong they are. Oddly enough the more they love/like someone the more they try to sabotage that relationship.To mention a few. Don't worry about sterotypes, it is what it is. It's wheter or not you judge them for who they are and what they are not is what is important. I love my son more than life it's self. I couldn't live without him, and I let him know on a daily basis how important he is to me. He gives me purpose. Some of them are really "messed up". Hows that for a loaded thought.|`|fPFXJr3eaa	Do some reading about the trauma an infant goes through when they are separated from their mother and it will help you understand them a little better.    They are not odd, weird or "messed up" as such... they are struggling to come to terms with how they feel within themselves.... especially as they are moving into a time where finding one's identity is important.  Many of them may not even realise it has anything to do with their adoption as most do not remember consciously being adopted so are not necessarily aware they have 'issues' with their adoption.  They need acceptance, validation and the freedom to express themselves without the labels.     My best friend when I was 15-16 was adopted.  She was constantly talked about as "weird", moody etc.  While I was with her, she spoke of her mother constantly, always wondering when she was going to come and 'get' her.  My friend whom I loved so very dearly one day dropped me... just told me I was no longer her friend.  I was devastated and didn't understand.  I then found out she did this often (I was new at the time so didn't know her history).  My guess now is she did it so that I wouldn't reject her as we had become to close for her comfort zone.  Rejection is a big thing when you feel you have been rejected from the day you were born.    Hope this gives some insight?  As I am not adopted, I am only going of my own experiences and observations...

Those same 10-20 children may have been messed up if they had stayed with their biological family as well.  I am both adopted and have 2 adopted children- and I resent the comment that an adoptive parent could not love an adopted child as much as there own. My parents could not have loved me more when I was growing up. And I love both of my adopted children, who by the way "are my own". I am not saying that there aren't some messed up adopted kids, but that does not necessarily mean it is because they were adopted.  You said that you do not want to stereotype- well you just did.|`|5c20d0d97944d554addc48e11c13abe3aa	What you see in your assessment doesn't necessarily have something to do with them being adopted however it is very possible. Every adoptee and their situation is different. A great majority of adoptees have a very difficult time in life because they grow up not knowing their true identity or where they came from, etc....  Children bond with their mothers straight from birth and when the children aren't given that opportunity it is very difficult.     As possum said "It can be tough growing in a house full of genetic strangers - that have no looks or talents like your own. "     I was an adoptee and from my personal experience it was very difficult. After my mother had me she just looked at me, didn't hold me or touch me or anything. I never got the opportunity to have that bond and it has been very hard on me. I got stuck with assholes. I have AP that I still to this day can't get along with. It is extremely difficult because I have ADHD, OCD, Hypothyroidism, and I'm lactose intolerant and they don't understand much of it at all. Having disabilities and medical issues and not having much information about it or the biological family medical history is difficult. My AP always say that I am using my medical stuff as an excuse and whatnot and they just do not understand me at all. We have never been close and never will. I went through a very very difficult childhood. My AP constantly put me down, yelled at me, called me names, and blamed me for everything and all of that just brought me down and gave me low self esteem. I always felt that I didn't fit in and that I was useless and lazy and not wanted. I would always scream at my AP saying "you're not my real parents". I hated it so much. I told myself that I wanted to find my biological mother and I dreamt of it my whole life. Not a day went by that i didn't think about my biological mother. I often wondered what she was like, what did she look like, did I look like her, did we share a lot of traits, did i get my medical issues and disabilities from her, do i have siblings, did she ever wonder about me, etc.....  Well after waiting waaaay too long I finally set out to pursue my dream, not knowing what the outcome would be or whether I would actually be able to find her was emotionally hard. I told myself that I was going to do whatever it took to find her and I did. I am not upset with her decision, she did what she had to do and I admire her very much for that. It was the hardest thing she has ever done. For a mother to love their child SO much to let them go shows just how incredible they are and that they would do anything for their child.     When I first saw my mother (the day I met her) I immediately got some of my answers. I look a lot like her, we have a lot of the same traits, and we have a lot in common. I grew very attached to her. I have loved her all of my life and now I love her so much more. I now live with her and my life to this day is better than it's ever been. I couldn't be any happier. The bond that we have is incredibly strong. I could never be mad at her for what she, she did it all out of love. We have each other now and that means the world to me. She is the best thing that has ever happened to me and I love her more than anything in the world. She is an incredibly strong and amazing woman. After learning of all the hell I went though she wishes she would have kept me and I wish I could have grown up with her and I know deep down in my heart that IF she had kept me I would've had a great life. I am very blessed to have, and my family.    After finding my biological mother I finally got my closure. To finally know who I really am and where I came from and so much more means everything to me. It is one of the best feelings in the world to me. I feel that I can finally live my life and be happy. I have an amazing mother and wonderful loving family. I couldn't ask for more.|`|3dSCbIcEaa	most adopted newborns dont get the normal love and care that biological newborns get, whether it be bc they were in an orphanage as an infant or their adoptive parents didnt know nething about attachment.  I mean, if u rip a puppy away from its mother sooner than 6 weeks, it is never quite right.  Why would it be different with humans?

There is an old trick passed down by my grandmothers. What you do is set a thermometer by your bed. When you wake up in the morning before you even move around (i.e. stay in bed) take your temperature. It should be the same until a few days before your period. On the day that it is different it should be higher. That is the perfect day to conceive. That means you are ovulating and ready to go. Anytime during that day should be perfect.    Now,if that doesn't work it might be time for you to see a doctor. YOur husband's sperm count may be down OR you may have something wrong with your eggs or ovaries. Sometimes drugs or surgeries can fix the problem but other times it cant.    Age doesn't really matter. A man can still have kids when he is way into his 70s. I forget who it was.....but he had kids at 72. (Grr....don't you just hate when you can't think of someone's name)    I hope this helps. Always going to a doctor is a good idea if there is a problem.|`|UHmmhpHsaa	he needs to be sleeping with u not his mistress. she probly has more kids than she wants by now|`|xQsMPtFGaa	my parents are 9 years apart and had no problem making us 4 children. save yourself some time and just go to the doctor.|`|oojVKGjCaa	you wont get good answers here, go with a doctor that way you both be pretty sure about your problem :) good luck|`|cUFp70goaa	The best advice I can offer is to go to the doctor. It is impossible to make any type of decision without knowing if anything else is wrong. Perhaps, he doesn't have a high sperm count or you could have ovarian cysts. It's really important to get checked especially because your doctor can give you advice on how to get pregnant. My sister had a really hard time conceiving as well, they tried for about 4 years. She went to the doctor for a check up and so did her husband. The doctor found that they both had a lingering yeast infection! once they got it cleared up, they got pregnant. i would say in this case, you ABSOLUTELY should go to the doctor.

PRzmwFfgaa	Yes.  You can.  Just talk to your sister about it. If they were to take them out of the home the first thing they will do is ask your sister if there is someone that she can call to come and get her children.  Let her know that you want her to call you.  They will come to your house and make sure you have a place for them to sleep, food, and hot water.  That's their main concerns.  But if they are not in any immediate danger (ie- she isn't physically abusing them, she is feeding them) then they will more then likely not take the children out of her home.|`|MHOxPs8Oaa	Depends on the circumstances. Sometimes yes sometimes no. They may first place them with foster care so they aren't around any relatives. It sounds very rude and because it is rude. I have had personal experiences with it. My nephew was abused and there was plenty of places he could go including my grandparents that are foster parents, but they didn't want him to be with anybody that the family knows.|`|F6lZHRkVaa	Yes, you can get them - but not immediately. It could take a couple of days or even a couple of weeks.

LeaUjOoUaa	My own daughter has a hard time starting on tasks. I don't think it has anything to do with her willingness to clean or do the work. She has a hard time processing what to do first and breaking down a large task into intermediate steps. If I tell her to go clean her room, she procrastinates. If I give her each step, she gets right to the task and then we move on to the next. I think it just depends on the kid and how well they handle that process. Also, it can depend on the condition of the room. The bigger the mess, the more overwhelming the task can be.|`|CcXRDqWqaa	Some kids find it entertaining or interesting to organize their rooms, its normal (a kid is telling you this)|`|TXKKOa1Jaa	Well, I hate milk, some kids do.

I think its a personality thing.|`|o1irBbeNaa	good parenting|`|UHmmhpHsaa	did u like cleaning ur room if yes then u know why  if u did not like doing it ..... then u know|`|8KZ7HKgvaa	I agree with the parenting.. you have to make it seem fun and teach them that having things clean is good, and that if they do it they are being responsible. Its obviously better to instill this in young children|`|OMHKp1nhaa	Well, I wouldn't say loath, but maybe kid's have better things to do?    I think if a parent is bossing a kid around whilst they them selves are being lazzy it should be punishable by law. (just kidding) But kids are motivated by their parents so they posibly aren't acting because they think their parents don't have to.
Jswomud7aa	That's the perfect time to get pregnant.     And No, relieving himself doesn't affect sperm production unless he's constantly doing it for an extended period of time! haha    Your boobs can not be swollen from being pregnant, because technically you can't be at this point. It takes 5 days for the egg to implant inside your uterus after fertilization and then another 10 days to possibly experience symptoms of pregnancy if any at all.|`|jgtfWjE4aa	the first thing that told me i was pregnant were sore, full breasts!    good luck|`|la8W09sFaa	any time a male pre ejaculates and/or ejaculates into a females vagina there is always a chance of becoming pregnant. around 2 weeks after your period you should be ovulating, so your chances are heightend. 10-14 days after the 1st day of your period is a good time, if you see the egg white cervical mucus before of after that time that is the best indicator of ovulation. implantation signs can be spotting, cramping, pelvic pressure, bloating, gas, ovary pain. etc.|`|rev4lrn0aa	You are supposed to have sex 14 days after the first day of your last period - that is when you are ovulating. You most likely would not be feeling symptoms of pregnancy that early on. It would make his sperm less concentrated, try having sex every other night around the time you are ovulating.

It can cause multiple births|`|imFpyj7Gaa	i hope not my dr didn't tell me that.|`|LByD8RKoaa	well it depends sometimes it can turn out to be a no but most of the time yes|`|81bd6d1d0c0eef55c6c7c2a1f1f1a3ccaa	I have heard that there is an increased risk of multiples when a woman is on Clomid, but it is not a certainty.

rcdTluUjaa	You can engage at any time, and though being engaged puts pressure on the cervix and may help dilation you can be at -3 in labor. -4 which is just coming into the pelvis to +4 station which is on the perineum or ready to be born. When the top of the babies head, arrives at the level of the ischial spines, the baby is said to be at 0 station or "engaged. You can engage at any time though and it has absolutely nothing to do with how close you are to your due date. Just try and relax, I guarantee you will give birth eventually, and you still have 3 weeks to go before you are term.|`|yJXX9kLqaa	Is this your first pregnancy? In second and further pregnancy's the baby doesn't really drop till labor. If this is your first pregnancy it is still totally normal, usually the baby will drop around 2weeks more or less before labor so you still have plenty of time. Only time will tell if you are past your due date but try to remember that most women don't deliver on their due date, and just try to relax and savor the last of your pregnancy because once the baby is out your body feels sorta lonely.(although your brain and heart are happy to hold your child at last)|`|Oj5oZYJ4aa	This is a though question because every women is so different.  I was -3 station up until the day I had my daughter.  I don't think -3 station is to high at 37 weeks, I think it's pretty normal.|`|w43tUGP8aa	That isn't high at all. A baby can drop pretty fast. You can be at -3/-2 and then delivery later that same day.|`|kg3yEYtAaa	okay.. ill clear some of this up for ya!    station is the relationship of the baby's head to your ischial spines (in your pelvis).. or the pelvic outlet.. if thats easier.    the level of the spines is 0.    -3, -2, -1, 0, +1, +2, +3    is how we describe the baby's decent.    -3 means your still pretty high, and the baby is "floating".. it has quite a way to go.    +3 or +4 (some places) is crowning..        its hard to tell even for the examiner,....     ive had several women who were -3 go into labor.  of course their labors tend to be a lil longer cause their baby has "further" to go.. but its not always the case..
q0JTN9QAaa	Have you tried hitting one of them.  They would think twice before messing with you if they knew you would not take it.|`|FwJLD1uDaa	thats hard, but to be honest you should tell your parents. ignore them when they do that crap - they just want attention and dont know what to do about it. good luck :)|`|Q412OM5gaa	I guess they must like your backside. LOL. Just ignore them. I wouldn't really say they are bullying you, just being immature. Plus, if they know it bothers you, they'll just keep doing it.    If it REALLY bugs you, then just scream "Perv!" in front of a bunch of people. They will be embarrassed and won't want to bother you again. Lol. :P          *EDIT! Oops, sorry, I think I mussunderstood this. But I still say ignore them. If you are happy with youself it doesn't matter what anyone else thinks. They're just immature and have nothing better to do. Maybe you could tell them that unlike them, you actually have a life because you have better things to do than pick on people. Also say that they must have some pretty bad self esteem issues if they feel the need to keep picking on someone and that no one thinks it's funny anymore except for them and their immature friends. I'm really sorry if this doesn't help you. I'm 14 years old and people used to pick on me that way too, but I just ignored them and eventually they just stopped. No one even bothers anymore. I've gotten taller and skinnier. You'll probably grow out of this too, and if you don't you can excercise. You will feel great once you reach your goal. Prove these boys wrong! Also, I just wanted to say that I saw your other question, and that you are a very beautiful girl and don't let anyone make you think otherwise. Many people would kill for those stunning eyes you've got! Be condfidant! One day you might do something so amazingly great, and these people that pick on you will be sorry for it. :]    P.S. The screaming perv thing might still work, because it will still embarrass them. ;]|`|01Mu3wUeaa	"Keep talking smack and my staffy will tear your testicles right off your body!"      lol j/k.

OxFV92hJaa	1st-2 months, BAD time with them. literally laid on the floor in tears for the first 3 weeks! It was horrid! (3rd degree)    2nd- 5 weeks, bad again, but not as bad as the first. I was only in the floor in tears for 2 weeks that time. (3 degree tri lateral)    3rd- was HEAVEN! Only needed 2 stitches and didn't have ANY problem with them at all! My payback is now 2 months post partum needing to have my gallbladder out! Sugery is scheduled for the 20th....DAMN!|`|IXBl5l5kaa	Ugggh lol, don't remind me.    I think I was not fully healed and comfortable until about 7 weeks..? I have no idea the degree of my tear and how many stitches, I just know it sucked. Well, actually I was cut (healing is more difficult than actually tearing). I couldn't even go through with the Mirena implant at 6 weeks, the exam hurt so bad. Good thing, though. I changed my mind and went for Implanon in my arm instead.    And it was 11 weeks before my husband and I were successful with intercourse and that was PAINFUL. It's like they stitched me up like a drawstring bag.|`|0nIwKd5Uaa	Depends on how far they had to cut and if you tore.     With my 1st i tore from end to end, took um that area almost 3 months to completely heal.      With my other children it only took a couple weeks. Because i didn't tare and the doctor didn't have to cut that far.|`|5ZvALiclaa	i had a second degree tear and it took a couple of weeks for the stitches to dissolve and heal but I never had any problems with them|`|iXQYd0Cmaa	I still haven't completely healed but its only been two weeks for me, but I am feeling great now and they don't hut anymore my doctor said that it takes about six weeks for them to heal completely, longer if you get an infection|`|hktlWRoIaa	i ripped from from as far south to as far north i could go. and my stitches took about 4-6 months to be completely healed. and that was just to the point where i could have semi-comfortable sex. but doctors say usually about 6-8 weeks...|`|1xNVPECpaa	mine.. 10 days.. give birth at 35 weeks pregnancy.. my baby so small..|`|Hif5SX8vaa	never
n2O0NwR6aa	Definitely don't lie to her.  Just answer her honestly, but with age-appropriate detail.  You don't have to tell her the whole story the first time she asks.  Young children are often satisfied with a brief, simple answer. If your answer doesn't satisfy her, she'll ask for more detail; just play it by ear and let her questions, and her reaction, guide you.  For example:    "Do I have a daddy?"  "Yes, you have a daddy, but he doesn't live with us."    Believe it or not, that might satisfy her for the moment.  She may be like, "Oh, okay." and go back to her toys.  Or she may ask more questions:    "Why doesn't he live with us?"  "Because he didn't think he could take care of a little girl."    "Where does he live?"  Be honest: "I don't know." or "He lives in California."    "Will I ever get to meet him?"  "I don't know, maybe someday."    She may want to know his name, what he looks like, etc.  Just answer her honestly.    As she gets older, she may start to ask more difficult questions.  She'll probably spring them on you when you're least expecting it, so think ahead of time how you might answer questions like:    Why couldn't he take care of me?  Why didn't he want me?  Will he ever come back?  Can I call him? Can I go meet him?  If he met me, do you think he'd want to be my dad?  Will you tell me where he is so I can call or write him?    I think it's wonderful that you want her to have an anger-free attitude toward him.  And she will, if you answer her questions with that same attitude.  She'll take her cues from you, and the way you talk about him.      Good luck!|`|kyPV2D4kaa	I had the same concern with my son. His father left before he turned one, and he is 3 now. He has never known a daddy so, he's never asked for daddy. I would say definatly don't lie to your daughter if she asks. Just tell her the truth, and she will understand when she is a little older.|`|JFAN02giaa	You should definetly not tell her he's dead. Tell her her dad loves her very much and he left because he couldnt handle being a father. Don lie to her cause that would make her ask more.|`|bS2GSqlSaa	I think it would be just plain wrong to tell her that her dad is dead when he isnt. If I was in your shoes I would tell her the truth. She'll understand the older she gets. Dont let your parents tell you what to do, its your daughter what you think is right is what you should do.|`|GEXsNLgZaa	don't tell her that her father is died that would just make it worse what if one day he decides to come into her life and she'll find out you lied that might make it worse.      just tell her the truth but when shes a little bit older.|`|MANRH72Daa	Well don't tell the lie to your own child it may be a serious trouble in future when she know her father is still alive and also you must not say you were leaved him just say your father live in another place and try to understand her he is marry an another women (it may be correct because it may the reason you were leaved) .!|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	you cant miss what you never had..My daughter isnt effected at all ..she knows she has a dad in another state. But he isnt a good dad because he never see's her doesnt support her and her siblings. All she needs is one parent to make her secure in feeling loved. She met him when she was 4 and wasnt impressed.|`|EyKJ737daa	Sweetie, she is 2, she will not be angry as long as you tell her the truth.  Do not tell her that her father is dead as this will come back and bite you on the backside in years to come.  It really isn't worth the risk.  Start now even though she is only 2, (they understand heaps more than we give them credit for sometimes), tell her how lucky you are to have met her daddy and that she wouldn't be here if it weren't for him. Daddy is troubled at the moment and can't be with you both but maybe one day he may come back and see her. Don't go into too much detail as you don't want to put the weight of the world on a little 2 year old's shoulders, nor do you want her to feel that it's her fault that daddy left.  Tell her you love her daddy for helping you to create her.  Emphasize his good points especially in front of her.  Show her that you have no hatred towards him even though he can't be there to help you with her.  She will take a lot of her cues in life from you and your attitude towards things as well as your parents so ask them to be on good terms when mentioning him too as this will help her and all of you to deal with more in depth questions she will no doubt ask as she gets older, but I would cross that bridge when and if she does ever ask.  All the very best sweetie and good luck.|`|rhreN8wbaa	I think you should definitely tell her the truth if you want her to trust you when she gets older. You should tell her exactly that "He is the reason you are here, so don't be angry" also, you should explain why he left if that helps with the not being angry thing.|`|IMpnREJqaa	Don't tell her he is dead. You should always be honest with your daughter and if her father ever came back around she would know you lied to her.      You should tell her the truth. It may confuse her or hurt her but she needs to know the truth. It will only make her stronger. If you lie to her and try to shelter her from pain she will only grow weak.
EyKJ737daa	Yes it was a sad story wasn't it. I have a 5, 3 and 16 month old and I just couldn't cope if I lost any of my kids especially under the circumstances in which they lost their little girl too early.  I don't know if a special day though would be any help, every day would be hard for a parent that has lost a child.  However I do think a site that has just been released in QLD is a good idea for victims that have lost a loved one due to bad drivers, whether drunk, high or under the influence of anything else and have killed an innocent person.  This site lets those people tell their story in order to help them heal and deal with each day.  Some of the stories are so touching and so sad.  I think a site like that for people who have lost a child too early would be a fantastic idea.  The site I'm referring to is call "My Story" at http://sharemystory.qld.gov.au/portal/in...|`|nrqWwQBXaa	yes that would be nice and even might help?|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	people usually like to keep that personal and have their own vigils ..its not really something you want to be a community event|`|01Mu3wUeaa	Sure, why not?      Perhaps spreading awareness will help at least one child from losing his/her life to abuse.|`|ErQWfSPNaa	Yes, I know what you are talking about. I also live in Australia and that news was horrible. I think its a good thing to have a day of rememberance, but a better thing to have some sort of charity for abused children/families or children or families in need of councilling or help that would be recognised every year on the same day that that poor little girl lost her life.|`|olqLQ72Yaa	No because that implies that people who die above a certain age somehow aren't as important or their death wasn't as tragic. No one is ever old enough to die, at least, not from their family's perspective.

q7sgWqZ3aa	If the parent trusts the teen then they may not see a reason to monitor what they do on the computer.    My mom didn't monitor me but I always had my bedroom door open so even if she walked by and looked, I had nothing to hide. I mostly used it for school work/papers but I did have a myspace- private profile, only added friends from church/school and my photos were decent and viewable by only my friends. My comments had to be approved and on top of that My mom was my  1 friend and she could see what I wrote on myspace and everything that I did on myspace.    My sister on the other hand, she is/was monitered because, well my mom don't really trust her like she does me. At her age I hadn't done anything that my sister has done but she's internet safe really. She don't put anyting indecent or stupid on myspace .    My mom basically just checks the history of the computer to see what my sister has done. My sister don't really spend that much time on the computer anyway, she's more outgoing and people orientated then I was at her age. My sister don't know how to view the history on the computer so she can't erase it lol.    My mom had a set up similar to a school computer- so anything you couldn't do on your school computer you couldn't do it at our house, no matter where the computer and laptops were.    It's really up to the parents to decide to monitor their child/teen computer time. I can't say yes or no to that because it really depends on the teen and parents.|`|SfuVoSKfaa	Depends on their age. I think yes, so they won't be expose to any thing inappropriate or harmful.|`|twVyisGnaa	No, they shouldn't.  I mean, we all have a right to privacy and stuff.  However, parents should be able to check on their kids like at a few-minute intervals and the History should be checked once in a while for any nasty stuff.    VIVA LA RAZA!|`|6L9jJnchaa	I don't think teenagers should have access to their own computer at all.  It should be in a public area of the house where it can be monitored at all times.  If you have nothing to hide, it shouldn't bother you, right?    Edit:  Oh, GOOD LORD.  I'm so sorry.  I forgot when the computer is in a public area, you can't send your little myspace bra and panty pics to your little boyfriends.  How foolish of me!|`|n53HeORBaa	yes, but they have to limit the checking just to see if the site is safe for the kids, but if they are chatting on line or checking their messages then they should give some space and privacy, and since they are not using your computer, then that means your parents trust you and you should not abuse that trust or otherwise they would always be looking over your shoulder|`|nrqWwQBXaa	yes they should be monitored these days kids do a lot of bad things with the web. so it would be a good idea?|`|5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	You bet. Our computer with internet is in the living room in a corner, screen facing out. Yes, it's a pain - but we do it for everyone's sake.  I know all my son's accounts (oh, yes I do), and fully know how to access his history, etc. should I need to.  Son has a laptop he uses in his room, mostly for music. No internet there.|`|9be22b5e8274ad1db7ce0512878cadc5aa	Yes but only to an extent. It isn't necessary to stand over their shoulder the whole time but perhaps a computer in the living room is a better idea.|`|FiUprYsvaa	I think if you teach kids right from wrong and instill in them good behavior and teach them to be the kind of people that don't need to be monitored then you don't need to watch over them as much.     I have had a laptop in my room since I was 16 and I am now 19.   There is no reason for me to have been monitored or for anyone to do so now.|`|CO5jcxMraa	yes. although the internet is very useful. it is also very easy for a kid to look up inappropriate materials.|`|8OyLAvxOaa	No.|`|JsqMSU9Haa	we don't plan to have computers in our kids rooms - they will be in commonplace areas.  yes, they should be monitored - not all the time or religiously, but parents should check on what their kids are watching/doing/who they are talking to.|`|PxawVQ7Xaa	Every one has the right to privacy. 99% of the reason a parent would do that is just out of nosiness. Just tell them not  give out their address or phone number and nothing will happen.    Should the government put cctv in every one's house would all of you be ok with that "If you have nothing to hide it shouldn't bother you right?"

5ZvALiclaa	colic is incessant and inconsolable fussying or crying in an infant that happens 3 or more days a week for at least 3 hours a day.  http://www.med.umich.edu/1Libr/yourchild...  http://www.babycenter.com.au/baby/health...    these websites help to explain it better and how to treat it    best of luck|`|cMpYz5B4aa	colic is sometimes used an adjective instead of a noun- it's just a description of a baby that cries for more than 3 hours around the same time every day. however, it can be a belly ache caused by gas-and p.s. breastfed babies can have colic too, that's neither here nor there. you can try mylicon gas drops, enfamil gentlease formula (if formula fed) gripe water- by baby bliss, and the most important thing to do is just burp your baby. if all else fails, just know it's a phase that a lot of babies go trhough and it will eventually go away.|`|578d3fb2ddadd63f9be866329b168f56aa	colic is basically unexplained unconsolable crying. it typically tends to last and hour or so, and usually about the same time of day everyday. the baby will just start wailing and nothing you or anybody can do will settle them down. they claim the baby is not is any pain.  it's really stressful, but usually passes within a few weeks or months. every baby usually has a fussy time, but colic is more over the top than just fussy.|`|A13guVSCaa	hey there is not really much what u can do. Just always blurb the baby.  breastfeed or formula...has nothing to do with...  you can also cary the baby like a swing...its in front of ur body/belly...massage his tummy, it helps to get gas out.  tee is also an option.herbal no sweets.  or have baby lay alot of his tummy...    good luck
311bce43c0d6a6dc9442d046a8943886aa	i don't recommend it at all, it hurts, lol..I did attempt to get it done but then they poked a hole in my uterus so they couldn't continue..but i will not ever try that again, it really felt like they were ripping my insides out, but who knows, maybe everyone is different..you could possibly be one of the lucky ones :]...i prefer the depo :)|`|6y94LMmqaa	I honestly think it depends on your bodys reaction to the IUD I myself had an extremely bad scenario however alot of people have experienced success talk to your doctor he can let you know if your a good candidate
AA11763588	Don't take in to many salty foods, this will cause high blood pressure.    You should try the BRAT diet:    Bananas  Rice  Apples (no skin, it will upset the belly)  Toast (dry or unsalted crackers)    Also make sure you keep up on your fluids, water, 100% fruit juice or Gatorade is best.    When all else fails call your DR and ask if you can get a prescription of Zofran.    Good Luck!|`|jNqf8HtDaa	salteen crackers are better for you and try drinking ginger ale|`|6988FTAYaa	not be rude to you or anyone but at 5 weeks you shouldnt be craving any kind of food...lol...im 13 weeks and i just started craving cold stuff and this is my 2nd child...but for your morning sickness i would just call your doctor to see if he can give you something to take for that..good luck      i knew i would get a thumbs down but oh well!!!|`|eV7rtxmuaa	Hey babe    Im in the exact same spot. Appox 5 weeks pregnant and craving salty savory foods. I usually stay away from those sorts of foods. Its got me stumped.|`|Xt7jo8bcaa	Just go with it...it's hard to exsplain why...nothing is wrong here...just go with it...as time goes on...you will crave other foods...some u never ever would give a second look to...then all of a sudden u need it...Look at it this way..it's your baby telling u what to eat|`|3cdb0Tmraa	Your body is obviously seeking out salts and sugar, try taking some tissue salts. Being preg uses up a lot of energy, so your bady is trying to get fast sources of energy boosting. Rather that fries try oven bake chips just as yummy. As for potato chips swap it for popcorn. They should curb your craving and give your body the salty it's lookin for but in a more healthy way!! Soft drinks are ok but rather have the Tab and Sprite 0 or coke light etc and add a lot of ice so you are drinking less than you would when you have it without.  Hope this will help a little :)|`|y4Uliyq3aa	Seems normal to be....however you might want to eat as healthy as you can both for yourself and your baby.
CRVi3YsOaa	i am going through the same thing with you right now. I am hoping that they are implantation cramps and i will get a bfp soon, but it is too soon to test. good luck, baby dust.|`|9FztHceJaa	go to the doctor now you could be having a miscarriage same thing happen to me|`|Oj5oZYJ4aa	I had what felt like period cramping with all 3 of my pregnancies right before I found out I was pregnant.  You could be pregnant.  If the cramping gets really bad I would get it checked out though.|`|yfQzRA2uaa	To the previous poster, you can't have a miscarriage 4 days after ovulation when it's unlikely you've even implanted yet. That would be incredibly rare.    To the original question, those cramps could be implantation cramping. When the fertilized egg digs into the lining of the uterus to make a home it can get a bit uncomfortable, like period cramps. You may also experience a little bleeding, too.    Good Luck!
EyKJ737daa	Sweetie, I feel your pain.  I have 3 girls and I hate it when they are sick.  My eldest has williams syndrome.  She was diagnosed at 2 but when she was a wee little baby she was diagnosed with severe reflux.  Doctors at the hospital said it was the worst they'd seen in a baby so young. At age 15 months, my eldest stopped eating and I could no longer get meds into her to ease the pain of the reflux. She went straight to hospital where they performed an op called the "nissan's fundoplication". This worked and stopped her reflux, only problem is now that when she does have a tummy bug like Gastro, it takes her much longer to get over it because she can't throw up and get rid of the bug.  Poor little mite doesn't understand why she feels so sick and can't throw up, just dry reaches instead and that is even harder to watch believe me. You know that when they throw up they feel better for a while till they throw up again.  My eldest can't so she feels sick all the time until it finally passes some days later. My eldest is now 5 years old, she still feels unwell at times and tells me but I can see anxiety attacks starting in her little eyes because she knows what could happen.  My 2nd is much more resilient and doesn't often get sick but when she does, she gets it real bad and she LOOKS sick. She tends to get over stuff very quickly though thank goodness.  My 3rd and youngest is only 16 months.  She has always been prone to sore throats and coughing badly (just like her mummy).  I will often give her some nurofen for children to help with her coughing.  I will also fill a syringe (not the needle ones of course) with warm honey and lemon juice and administer that to her. It does seem to ease it.  Have you tried reflexology? My mother does this and has shown me things to do to help my girls and OMG I hate admitting our parents are right but honestly my mum is right, it does work.  My youngest only recently had nearly a 40 degree temperature last week (39.6 degrees celsius). I called the doctor out one night and she checked her over and said that she had some viral throat infection and teething as well.  If it got worse to get a script filled that she left for us just in case. Well I sat my baby down and fed her (breastfed) and while I did that I massaged her little feet.  Around her big toe and on and in between her little toes. Well within 2 days, her sore throat had gone and so had her bad cough. She is now running around quite happily with her big sisters as though nothing was ever wrong.  Can I suggest that you give your son a good foot massage up around the top of his foot and the ball of his foot and also in the arch of his foot.  Here is a link on where all the reflexes are on your son's feet not to mention your own.  http://www.bettysgoa.com/images/foot_ref...  Hope this helps sweetie.  sorry my answer is long winded to but your not alone, no one wants to see their little baby in discomfort or pain.  All the very best and I hope your son gets better very, very soon.|`|SahUDTLnaa	Honey I feel for you .it's one of the hardest parts to being a mother, and it never goes away. My  children are all grown and married with families of their own now. But when they are sick or hurting I am crazy with worry, But that's just love  I have to pray a lot. So, sorry to hear my little guy sick. I shall be praying for him and you too. Keep the faith.|`|P8VoBR0saa	Have you tried the mucinex for kids? that seemed to work for my daughter when she had a bad cough also a nebulizer helped her sleep, have you tried maybe making the tea with lemon and honey into like a popcicle, i'm not sure how good it would taste but he might like it and it would be cold so it would help the soreness of his throat, hope this helps|`|lzivF4Idaa	i have a 6 month old with Cystic Fibrosis, his coughs will never go away. having to do treatment and chest therapy everyday will never go away. having to take enzymes with every meal just so he can digest food will never go away. how do i deal with it? i dont well, it keeps me up at night. its the worst thing thats ever happened to me.     have your son sleep on an incline, stuff some stuff under his mattress it will help with the congestion. let him sit in the bathroom, close the door and run the hottest water you can in a bath, this should also help with his congestion.|`|x7WphuY5aa	try just a spoon full of raw honey my daughter is three she was up at 2 am and from 5am-7am coughing non stop so i gave her honey in 45 min she was sleeping and she hasn't been coughing as much today|`|AA10953561	Just last week my five year old caught a stomach bug. It only lasted a day, but it was one of the longest heart wrenching days of my life! Her stomach hurt her, she couldn't keep anything down (not even water), her eyes kept watering, and she had a fever. I let her lay on the couch and watch cartoons. I sat with her and held her and rocked her, but I felt terrible because I wasn't able to make it all just go away.    As a parent your child looks to you to fix all the boo-boos, and when they're sick they want the same thing but there's no way a kiss is going to make it better. So yes, you're not alone. I think every good parent feels this way.    I hope he feels better soon!|`|01Mu3wUeaa	Here are some links to natural remedies...read which ones will suite your little man best.    http://www.natural-homeremedies.org/home...    http://www.ayurvediccure.com/homeremedie...    http://www.natural-homeremedies.com/home...    http://www.health911.com/remedies/rem_co...
3cdb0Tmraa	3D and 4D (moving 3D pictures) scanning gives amazing three dimensional picture of your baby on the screen. Your baby can be seen moving, yawning, sucking its thumb and even apparently smiling.    The equipment uses sophisticated techniques, transforming the traditional 2D scan such as the one that you have at the hospital into a 3D and 4D images.    The scan uses the same ultrasound output levels as the hospital based 2D scanners and as the machine actually generates the image, the exposure time is minimised. The safety of ultrasound is constantly evaluated and the British Medical Ultrasound Society (BMUS) has produced documents to ensure its safe use.    With this in mind, your scan will only be performed by someone who holds a recognised medical or ultrasound qualification and who is registered with the appropriate professional bodies.    Hope this helps!! :)|`|gx4s68s8aa	3D are still images- 4D are moving images|`|Xrwvu5Uraa	one is 3D and one is 4D|`|ggfE4rlvaa	3D is just the 3D picture. 4D is picture and sound (such as the baby moving, and the heartbeat). You can even hear fluid swooshing sometimes, they're pretty cool.
145RUNQHaa	This is normal and a stage that will pass hang in there i know it must be very testing on your nerves but stay calm set a good example.by staying calm you are showing you have control over your own emotions and that will help him feel a bit more secure if he feels you are in control and it will teach him plenty.when he gets in that state he must be feeling terrible so i can't believe someone suggested slapping his butt.that is a ridiculous idea and would make things worse.how would you like it if you were breaking your heart over something and someone came over and slapped you?and putting in a time out is not nice either the little guy is already suffering when he gets in a state like that he does not need to be punished.nor will ignoring him help he needs to have his feelings acknowledged.it doesn't matter what he is upset about children this age will work themselves up into a state of the most tiny little thing that we would not have thought of!let him have his tantrum but sit somewhere nearby letting him know the offer of a hug is waiting when he is ready that way you are supporting him through what is  difficult time for him in a calm and controlled manner when he is ready for a hug comfort him and do a quiet activity together like colouring in.a tantrum will have exhausted him.keep it up your patience will pay off he will eventually grow more confidence and learn how to control his own feelings that way by the example you have set.x|`|FMpHtZnBaa	I was recently told tantrums are a sign of love from your toddler. They feel comfortable with you so they show just how they feel and know you wont judge them just ignore it and i will soon end.|`|XQ8ceSr1aa	sounds a little scary. have you tried time out for when he freaks out like that? that's what i do when i babysit my little cousins who are the same age, when they have a really bad flip out like that they have to go sit on the steps for 2-5 min with no toys or anything until they cam down and if they continue acting up every time they freak out they get another minute added. then they eventually learn they can't act that way.|`|Exkcdvbxaa	does he go to preschool?  If so, go to the school and talk to the teachers and observe him yourself.  Are you married?  Getting a divorce?  Is there a boyfriend in your life?  Have you left him with a sitter lately?.  So many ifs, I know.  But, someone could have harmed him physically.  Or he can be worried about something he can't verbalize.  Watch him with all the people in your life.  Try playing with toys and asking simple questions and see how he responds.  You need to take him to your dr if this continues.  Is there a new baby?  Have you recently moved?  Has a family member died recently? There are so many things that little ones can't figure out and they become frustrated.  Remember that anger usually comes from hurt.  Either real physical pain or mental pain.|`|GMz9ImSzaa	He is frustrated and throwing temper tantrums is probably the only way he can communicate how he feels.|`|TZN0v8r4aa	Just ignore him, walk away and don't talk or pay him any mind.|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	my son was like that ..you describe it well like and animal YOWLING not even sounding human. Freaked me out! Unable to soothe just defient!..They are overtired and dont know how to put themselves to sleep Is what I found... So the bath distracts and relaxes them. They outgrow it they are just dramatic to watch..Ignore the tantrums|`|lL3BzDslaa	Kirstin    It sounds like ur kid is developing early signs of anger problems which is common for boys...what you need to do is give structure which means some shows you let him watch are not healthy mentally.  Its gonna take some hard work but it will help....    if he mis behaves make him go to time out then comfort him  also a slap in the butt could work out discipline well atleast it worked wit my mother on me lol  What i do is do fun activities with him and bond with him more  Try not to make him be around negative energy, or his mind will mimic it.    See if the discipline and comfort will help if he is getting worse then you may need to see a really experienced person or professional    I have a 2 year old daughter and im 17. I show her discipline and affection which helped... she is such an angel and is so nice.  I think just being with her every hour doing fun activities with her and reading her a good story helped her brain developed a positive attitude which she is still growing. Also i never gave her a negative or a angry energy which helped me cope with my problems ive had    HOPE THAT HELPS TO A PARENT FROM A PARENT  CHEERS :) GOD BLESS|`|AA11091233	Kirsten..    I understand what you are talking about. You basically have answered your own question...........    You say when he has a fit, you try talking to him, picking him up, trying to calm him down.    Sorry......this is exactly opposite of what you are supposed to do that will help.    When he pitches a fit...you simply walk out of the room or ignore him. This is very important! This is completely normal for this age....so don't watch him, don't listen to him....especially don't try to talk to him to try and reason with him or calm him down.    As soon as you walk away like it's nothing...what is he going to do? He is getting a response out of you...which is what he wants...no matter how happy his life is. Tantrums just happen..it doesn't have to be for any specific reason...you aren't doing anything wrong...you are just a little misguided as far as how to handle it..which is part and parcel of being a parent. It's wonderful he comes from such a loving home.    I don't agree with giving time out's for tantrums at this age. They are going through a lot and trying to figure things out.     At 2 1/2 he could be overly tired, he could be bored, he could be wanting something he simply isn't able to verbally express. Tantrums are a way of gaining independence as well.    So let him hash it out on his own but don't react...whatever you do. The sooner you can do that...the sooner it will stop.    As far as hurting themselves...as long as you don't see any imminent danger...it is rare they hurt themselves so badly as to need medical treatment.    Seriously....your talking and touching him are only adding fuel to the fire.    The only thing you might want to check to see if he's had too much sugar...or his blood sugars are dipping...such as not eating enough or going too long without healthy snacks, meals etc.     Otherwise..this is pretty normal...and the sooner you stop the interaction...the sooner he'll figure it it doesn't do any good...and he'll outgrow it.    Best wishes to you!!
9CoTDEKVaa	The only advice I can give you is to either take another at home pregnancy test, or call your doctor for a blood test. Spotting is a pregnancy symptom, so it could be possible your pregnant if your having unprotected sex. Good luck, honey!|`|rcdTluUjaa	I would see your doctor, I had continuous spotting and a negative pregnancy test and it turned out to be an ectopic pregnancy. Which will turn into a life threatening emergency if not treated. If your period is late, you should show up on a test.|`|jNqf8HtDaa	your probably prego but i would take a test and make sure to do it in the morning and not after you had a lot to drink or eat fresh pee is what you need to take a test with|`|yJXX9kLqaa	Take another pregnancy test, if negative then call your doc to see what could be going on

5f69hQT2aa	Whenever I hear the name I also think of Poe's poem. I've actually considered it (hey, it's better than Lenore or Evangeline) as a serious name possibility. I think it is absolutely lovely and I see nothing wrong with it. I love the spelling Annabel, but again, that may be due to my affinity for Poe's work.|`|6SB4ufEYaa	I love the name Annabelle. ?|`|tHEBPDenaa	Annabelle isn't my favourite name but I definitely don't think of a cow! It's kind of cute actually! I think names all depend on how they suit the child so if you want to name your daughter Annabelle, you should go right ahead!|`|igvUbqkyaa	I love the name Annabel, especially the way you have it spelled!! All the other spellings are ugly I think. But stick with the name, it is super pretty!|`|Vd0a8fb7aa	I think the name is very pretty. And about the cow thing, if we didn't name our kids all the names that made us think about something else... we may as well give up. For a long time I didn't want to name my child a name I really loved- Scarlett- because I thought of Gone With The Wind. Well... who cares?|`|Bu7gdHbwaa	It does sound rather country but if you like it go with it|`|TYRRjIv4aa	Annabel is an adorable name, but spelled Annabelle. Anyways, forget about your so-called friend. She is extremely jealous of you and i would watch out for people like that in your life. You do not need friends like that. Good luck|`|kyPV2D4kaa	I think Annabel is a beautiful name! It also goes great with the middle name Lee! I wouldn't listen to other people with negative opinions. As long as you and your husband like it, that's all that really matters.|`|8fe3ZZDdaa	Annabel's not a bad name and I can't figure out how anyone could make fun of it...    I'm quite fond of "Anna" names.  I like Anna, Hannah and Annaliese...|`|Elxuvon8aa	rude but funny to me because we had a cow named Annabelle  I hate names with belle and bella in them they remind me of elephants I had forgotten about the cow.|`|sy0hiGspaa	I have always thought that Annabel is a name that won't age well. It seems like a good name for babies, but I've met Annabels that are older, and the name sounds babyish.     Sorry :)|`|y4Uliyq3aa	I Love the name Annabelle (spelled this way)! I think It Is a Wonderful name....not for a Cow at all.|`|4Nbiuj6Gaa	When I read the name Annabel, not once did I think of it being a cow's name. I think it's girly and has class to it too.|`|IGcS9K62aa	That was super mean of your friend! Annabel Lee is super cute. And it does not sound like a cow at all.   When I think bovine it's more along the lines of Betsy, Darcy, Daisy, Patty, etc.|`|IuzaNq2Uaa	Adorable - and I love the way you are spelling it.    I don't even know why people keep saying Annabel is a cow name - I grew up on a farm, and I never heard of a cow called Annabel before.|`|UbCzA2JVaa	I like the spelling Annabelle, but yes it is nice name. You could use Annabella instead?    It doesn't matter what your friend thinks, it is up to you to name your child and you can call her whatever you like!      :)|`|2TrHH0rkaa	I really like the name Annabel, it's very classic and traditional and extremely pretty :)|`|RNG1cT8saa	i dont like it, important thing when naming a child is how the child will be treated in school, if made fun of it could stay with her for hte rest or her life.|`|iKLdGe1xaa	Anabelle is nice. Is sweet and graceful sounding. It has a nice ring to it (excuse the pun).
QlbaXYeLaa	Hey hun!!     Yeah.. that was TOTALLY rude. Dont sweat it! ..she was just jealous because no one wants to get her money to go shopping. She probably just works there so she can get extreme discounts on the stuff because maybe she cant afford it. Next time.. just tell her.. "yeah =D I am spoiled!! and proud of it." haha.. she will than probably be like "WTF! Why'd she say this?!"  haha.       |`|ISKM1z8iaa	Tell her that if she stopped judging other people she might have a better job than working at the checkout. Its your money, buy what you want.|`|FGZR9RwDaa	well was she like OMG SPOILED BRAT!  or was she like omg you're so spoiled haha  like if she was saying it jokingly, then no it wasn't rudee|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	She's jealous. As long as you will wear the clothes and not throw a fit because you didn't get more than $500,then that doesn't classify you as a spoiled brat. I'd have told her to shut her pie hole. You should tell her boss! Employees aren't suppose to have an opinion on what their customers buy.|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	Yes I would ask to speak to her manager and complain, she could get fired for that.     it doesn't matter if you were spoiled or not she still had no right to say that, and yes clothes cost waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay to much money these days, i know i spent like $1,000 on clothes the other week (I hadn't gotten new clothes in a few years, it was about time, but in the end i didn't even get that much, well for 1k anyway)|`|gZ0NPuleaa	I've heard lots of sales people say things like that and they mean it as a compliment. It's a way of saying "lucky you". Don't sweat it. In fact ; Smile and say ( You bet I am!).|`|AA10192697	She doesn't know your money situation and she judged you in error.  Ignore her.  You don't have to justify yourself to her.  She might be jealous that she gets less for her birthday.  LEt it go.        A little advice from a grownup - pick your battles wisely.|`|1Z13L9h2aa	Yes it is.  That's okay girl. At least you have a life and she doesnt. :)|`|VuBwaWvxaa	yes thats rude!! her job is to sell the clothes not judge people. she was probably just jealous!!|`|E2UXN7J1aa	I never got more than 200 worth of clothing each year when I was younger....even as a teen. Once I got my own job and bought them myself I still didn't get that much, because I realized there were more important things to buy. However if the checkout girl said that...well that is rude and I simply would have told her it wasn't any of her business.|`|FiUprYsvaa	That is rude.   And none of her damn business.     Every year since I was born and my brother was born my mom has taken us to pick out clothes before the start of school and before the start of spring/summer.   She would spend about $500 on each of us.   I am 19 and she still does this.     I think if you have the money to spend and you buy a lot of stuff then that's fine.|`|8ryZyVUOaa	omfg thast horrible shes jelous|`|BVaOnbo2aa	You should tell her that with jealousy like that, she better be working her way through college. LOL    $500 really isn't too much. If you've got it, it's your right to spend it the however you want. Even a coat or purse can easily run that much.|`|piDDZ6Ywaa	That's a bit rude, just ignore her and say ''Okay'' xxxx|`|46ddc6b6990fcd5b5d5e36dc7b533ccaaa	WELL i think you are pretty spoiled|`|lL3BzDslaa	Seems like it buying all those clothes   but it wasnt right of her to say that especially if she worked there and doesnt know u personally    just forget it, people judge so much these days it like TMZ 24-7 u get wut im saying|`|4634a80965a88b3363a98ec2d2e5717faa	um id say the same thing...im sure it was just a shock to her and it had no meaning behind it i mean how often regardless of giftcards or not do people hand over 500bucks for clothes? not very often....sh!t id call you spoiled too damn can i get some?|`|9be22b5e8274ad1db7ce0512878cadc5aa	Say do your job and mind your own business|`|cWP73qEsaa	That was messed up and u should have answered her in a spoiled way like " you should treat me right because of people like me, you have a damn job ****** so thank me dont hate ! lol " shes just jealous|`|Z7dShLRLaa	Lol.  You sure like asking questions.      Eh that seems alot.  Even for me. O-o    I love shopping.    But what she said was RUDE.  I'd have her a*s fired.|`|l6jfVYVvaa	YES THE CLERK WAS RUDE.

MAYBE SHE WAS JUST TRYING TO MAKE CONVERSATION AND PICKED A BAD SUBJECT.|`|kv8ZFPP1aa	i do think you're kind of spoiled if you have 500$ to spend on just clothes.
d67309d0581f599a811cce3c7665378aaa	yes it's completely normal, you have tons of extra blood vessels in your nose during pregnancy, the only thing that my doc said to use, which did alleviate some of the pressure and dryness was saline nasal spray.(non medicated)|`|1f7by8LAaa	I've always had sinus problems but for about 4 months (8 months today) my nose runs all day, all night. Hormones and increased amounts of estrogen cause the stuffy, runny, dry nose. Just something you gotta deal with until baby comes :)  And nothing has worked for me except steam and a humidifier.|`|AA11763588	I'm 21 weeks and have been dealing with it since I was about 16 weeks.    I can't breath! My nose is RAW from blowing it so much! And every week it just seems to get worse!    My DR said the nasal spray was fine. So I just try to use it once a day, normally right before I go to bed because if I can't breath through my nose when I'm laying down, then I can't sleep.|`|tivpa7Vlaa	i read its normal but i usually have sinus problems and since i got pregnant i had the opposite effect. i had the clearest nostrils ever. even now i am good being 8wks post partum. hope my sinuses dont come back i enjoy living with out those nasal sprays|`|5V3K7a8qaa	I know how you feel. The garbage can next to my computer is FULL of tissues. I'm 33 weeks and I can't stop blowing my nose!|`|sr1niZlTaa	Lol, been there STILL doing that!  ( I'm due 2/14)  I feel like i'm pregnant with a cold, not a baby!  I tried nasal sprays and they just made my throat irritated, I have started sleeping with a humidifier and it seems to help.  Just know that its normal, I kept thinking I was an oddity!    Congrats on the baby!    ;]meg|`|VESdMODnaa	Ughhh, I'm only 11 weeks, and i've been sick for the past three. I hve bad allergies anyways, but lately i've blow my nose and blood comes out and I get terrible sinus headaches. Not to mention it's making my throat sore which is keeping me up at night! I've been wondering if nasal spray was okay. Thanks! you answered my question with your question.|`|AA12000802	Same here.  For me it started at 25 weeks with a sinus infection and my nose is still congested (though I feel a lot better) and now I'm 31 weeks.  I was told nasal sprays are not good for you but to use a saline solution but I haven't done that - I'm just putting up with it.  My throat is a tad sore as well.
jNqf8HtDaa	at 4 weeks i started throwing up  at 5 weeks my boobs were killing me and i started peeing all the time  around 6 weeks i started sleeping all day and not wanting to get out of bed   i cant really remember anything new at weeks 7 or 8|`|B8pUXlycaa	4 or so wks came down with a real bad cold that lasted nearly 2 wks  5 wks boobs tender  at about 6 wks nausea!|`|75c4fd1f4d2f05c3f64c60714f6b13d8aa	take a test and if it still says neg take again in a week if nothin happened yet. I stayed weepy, tired, nauseated, head was stopped up, back throbbed. Now im just angry and hungry LOL|`|4bc9102f8575b26ef5c74db497079303aa	every woman is different. with my first son i didnt have symptoms for 6 weeks, and my second son i had them almost right away.
CRVi3YsOaa	I am turning 25 this month. My husband and I have 3 kids, all girls. and we are currently TTC. and my husband says 'that's it'. but i feel that I am too young to get my tubes tied. My husband is not extactly in the safest line of work, it's not considerd dangerous, but there are certian risk. i feel that god forbid something should happen to him, i don't want to not be able to have children later in life. He will be 33 this year so i think that is his reasoning. but to each his own, it is your choice.|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	idk your young, you might regret it later in life when you 2 girls are grown and you miss having a baby around the house. You have a lot more time to have kids if you choose, but just remember a vasectomy can be reversed. =) get your husband clipped its quicker and its not major surgery, and Plus later in life it can be reversed if you decide to have more kids, or you can just get on some really good birth control, maybe the one they put in that prevents pregnancy for 5 years, they work pretty good and its a lot less work then taking a pill everyday    But in the end its whatever you want to do, you just may regret it later|`|gZ0NPuleaa	They have intrauterine devices now. I saw one advertised and you fit the criteria. Ask your doctor. They can be removed and restore your fertility.|`|lMvwVvqbaa	i am 21 with two kids and i don't think i want to tie mine. at this moment i don't think that want anymore children but 5 years down the road i might change my mind, so at this point i choose not to because i don't know how i will feel in the future. My mom told me she wished after she got hers tied that she would have never done it because she wanted another child after a while.|`|HWiL3YtPaa	No,your  to young there's other ways|`|Oj5oZYJ4aa	You sound very mature for 22.  I think that you are very smart for thinking about finances and if you would even really want to have another child.  I don't think your age should matter in this situation you have two daughters that you love and feel complete with, there is nothing wrong with wanting to be done. I understand that your husband may want one more little one but have you brought up your concerns to him? and told him you are happy with what you have right now?  I think it's important for him to know.  I have a feeling he may want to try for a boy, maybe that's why he want to keep the option open.

Aren't these the cutest things ever?|`|sDIvRlcjaa	i was miserable my first trimester. i took over the counter anti-nausea liquid which can be bought at wal mart and is safe during pregnancy. also i kept the smell of lemons around me at all times it really helped.

ORa2ZNAlaa	Of the 3 I like Kale the best. I also like Kade (not Kaden) and Kruz as well. Congrats!|`|sDIvRlcjaa	i like kian. i don't know if you want to hear others or not but i like kyler too. just a suggestion|`|SjNFANswaa	Kingston|`|7qh0OFCaaa	I wish my parents named me ''Kale'' ..that's one awesome name.|`|WoEsehoRaa	Kenneth  Kale  Kingston Keith|`|kyPV2D4kaa	Honestly, I like them all! I think I like Kingston the best though! Good Luck!!!!|`|y4Uliyq3aa	Kale sounds Great with Beckham!|`|4Nbiuj6Gaa	I like Kale. Short, simple but different.|`|oTJ9OKfUaa	theyre not good at all|`|Kpn4xceEaa	Kian (I like it!)    Kale is a vegetable  Kingston is trying to hard to be Gwen Stephanie (although I do like it)|`|073dfe1742ff65dfffbab08391ba6332aa	Must it be a "K" name? Of those, I guess I prefer Kale. A colleague of mine named their son that and they are decent enough people. Kingston sounds a little pretentious. Kian is my least favourite of the 3. You want to pick a name that works when your son is 3, 33, 103 and every age in between and not a name that sounds dated to right now. Personally I prefer more classic names.|`|2TrHH0rkaa	Kian is a great Irish name and Kingston is also great. Up to you which one you choose but I would be leaning towards Kingston as it's easier to pronounce :)|`|7dmmgSVfaa	kingstone  its uniquee and pretty famouse|`|a94b92cff3ce40968ac165e7d7ff52e1aa	I like Kingston but if you name him that it will seem like you are celebrity obsessed. Beckham, Kingston...|`|9CAXUgOZaa	I like Kian.       :)|`|tHEBPDenaa	I don't really like Kian or Kale but Kingston is really nice and it sounds good with Beckham as well.|`|E8kzNG3iaa	My favourite one is Kale...   but I think Kingston sounds the best as a *brother* name for Beckham - since they are both very formal and last-name sounding. Along the same lines, I think Harrison or Carleton "fit the bill" as well :)|`|Vd0a8fb7aa	I like Kian the best. And Beckham is SUCH a cute name!|`|0HFL3vocaa	i like kian and kale|`|KcfBOa9vaa	I love the name Kian. A guy my mom works with has a one year old named Kian and he's pretty much the cutest little boy ever.    I'm not liking Kale at all.    I kinda like Kingston but I just think of Gwen Stefani's son every time I hear it.    Good luck!|`|OIUzkGcuaa	I like Kale and Kingston.|`|BRqa4QkYaa	kingston|`|24rBuTqOaa	I love all three! But if I had to choose for my baby right now, I'd go with Kingston    Kian sounds the most girly of the three|`|RcKBIBkpaa	From the ones you've said, Kale    I personally like Kole & Kody, a little different/unique    good luck.|`|Aqhcl2eAaa	All of them sound really nice because they aren't names you hear everyday.  I think I like Kale the most!|`|sh5W8poAaa	My favorite of the three is Kale, second is Kingston, third Kian. I actually like all three, Congratulations!|`|0XbsqEr5aa	out of these Id go with Kale|`|eGI5s8R5aa	I like Kingston the most! Kian is also lovely and unique. I'm on the fence about Kale though--it just makes me think of vegetables, hehe. Here are some other suggestions (if you don't mind my presumption) that are in keeping with the "K" theme:    Keagan (Irish) "Descendant of the fiery one"    Keiran (Irish) "Dark"    Kingsley (English) "From the King's field"    Congratulations on the new baby and good luck!
6RDC9SvXaa	I have a friend that has a 3-year old boy with autism. The signs she started to notice was, he was not talking for his age,making noises,flipping the light switch on and off,getting up in the middle of the night and playing in the dark,no feeling to pain,wants hugs all the time, frustrated, crying, and he likes to run around naked. He is also allergic to many foods. It is best you get your son tested cause only a Dr. can say.|`|3F8f1SoQaa	without knowing more it is hard to say. It is always possible, especially since the doctor is concerned about it. I can tell you without a doubt that your son has an expressive speech delay of at least 12-15 months. My son said only 10 words at 2 years old...the rest was grunts and whines and pointing. We contacted early interventionamd they screened his speech for free. the speech therapist told me my son was 12 months behind. She suggested starting to teach him some sign language, so we did. Within a week or so of his learning a few basic signs his frustration and tantrums had a 90% reduction. He started getting 2x weekly speech therapy, and we saw amazing improvement within a matter of 3 months. Within 5-6 months of begining therapy he was saying 150+ words, and speaking in sentences. 9 months after starting therapy he barely qualified for special needs preschool. At 12 months after starting therapy he is age appropriate in his expressive speech (with articulation errors) we pay for NOTHING. He gets a school bus to come pick him up, and he has gotten probably $800 in therapy tools for his personal use.    to either set your mind at ease or confirm your fears you can actually do an autism/pdd screening at www.childbrain.com . you put in the childs age and answer about 40-60 questions about behavior and skills and it gives you a score of "indicative of ____ ( autism, pdd, nothing, etc)" you can print it out and take it to the specialists as a discussion tool.|`|AA11091233	Well, very sorry to say..it does sound like a possibility. The amount or severity is what the doctors can determine.    PLEASE buy Jenny McCarthy's new book...Mother Warriors. It is all about her having a completely dysfunctional autistic child (screaming and babbling, not connecting) were all symptoms her son exhibited. However, she should get some sort of award, as she has helped countless people cure their autistic child...mainly through a gluten and dairy free diet...sometimes supplements.    Please don't despair until you know for sure. And if that is the result..as least you now have some answers that have never been shared before through Jenny's work.    Wish you all the best...I truly do.|`|Cu8svhwAaa	It's possible.  Does he look at you when you talk to him?  If he does not then this is another sign of autism as well. I would definitely suggest you go ahead and let the doctor send him somewhere to be tested or have the tests run.  At least you will know for sure.|`|cl6r8cGBaa	are you having a hard time connecting with him?  i think it might be but i guess its on a mild level. but if he constantly hurts himself then that could really be a problem. did you check his sleeping pattern? does he sleeps well?  coz another factor is interrupted sleep pattern..things like that..an autistic child might have problems relating to differnt things, people. and only connects within their own self.|`|Zw52BAgQaa	maybe    hope not    xo    good luck chicka|`|Kpn4xceEaa	From what I understand, autistic children have difficulty reading people's emotions (don't know when you're getting frustrated or angry), don't make much eye contact, and don't show affection/bond with people. I know that cases can be severe or not so severe. They don't like loud noises (can' t filter out important ones), and don't like to be touched. Good luck - I truly hope your son will be okay.|`|6pLLPdPwaa	There are so many different kinds of things it could be. How is his social interaction with you and other children? Is he easily upset? There are several different types of autism. It is impossible to know for sure without being tested. I wish you the best of luck.|`|20NZn1YZaa	I would say if your child is not talking by 2 years old there is a likely chance he's autistic or has some other form of learning problems. OR perhaps he's just developing slower than normal. NO ONE here can tell you yes or no on whether he is definitely autistic. Only a doctor can diagnose this.    Jenny McCarthy's son is autistic and she put him on a special diet which has seemed to clear his condition completely (She has a book on it). Your doctor will more than likely tell you there is no statistical evidence this diet works BUT if it were MY child, I would atleast give it a shot. Should you find out your son is autistic it's important to learn as much as you can about it, and programs to help. I used to nanny an autistic boy and through therapy he had come a very long way and is becoming a much happier boy with less aggression.|`|b6fIIIhZaa	Symptoms      *   Abnormalities in initiating communication with others: Rather than asking for help with something, the child may struggle alone without looking around for assistance.        * Impaired ability to initiate and respond to opportunities to share experiences with others: Children with autism may not follow their parents gaze or initiate contact with others.        * Irregularities when playing with toys: Instead of using a toy as it is meant to be used, like picking up a toy fork and pretending to eat with it, the child may do something unusual with the toy.        * Significantly reduced variety of sounds, words, and gestures used to communicate: Compared with typically developing children, children with autism have a much smaller inventory of sounds, words, and gestures that they use to communicate with others.

With my first son the pregnancy test said negative, but I still knew that I was pregnant. 9 months later, a 9 1/2lbs baby boy!!
UKFL4wNVaa	I like Ryan,     don't use Connor, unless you change the middle name. This would make his initials CAB.     :)|`|XzV4bUeFaa	Liam better than Ryan|`|9CAXUgOZaa	Yup.    I never liked the name Evelyn, until I saw a girl who had it, but spelled it Evalyn. That made me like it better, so I prefer that spelling.   I still don't like it much, but it's not horrible.    Instead of Ryan, maybe Riley?    I also like the names:  Lucas  Logan  Cameron  Tristan  Noah  Oliver  Sebastian  Elijah  Tyler      Congrats :)    And I prefer Ryan to Liam. How about Leo?|`|VLr3jrutaa	congrats first of all.    Olivia Eileen is ok i like olivia but i am not sure about the second name but been a middle name i guess it doesn't really matter is usually a parents personal choice. mine is petraea so i can't say much.    I would definately swap evelyn and kate around to kate evelyn and besides olivia and kate sound really good when said together which is going to happen a lot.     Some boys name i like are    Julian   Bailey - Love that name  Nathaniel|`|DP48dIxhaa	I like Ryan Alan, Olivia Eileen, and Evelyn Kate. Good choices. I really like Evelynn Kate. I like Liam better thannn Ryannnn though. Liam Alannn Brock??? Ryan Antonelli, Ryan Joseph, Ryan Thomas, Jacob Ryan, Oliver Ryan, Bones Ryan, Sawyer Ryan, Rinaldo Ryan, Liam Anthony, Gable Liam, Harry Dean, Dayton Vaughn, Gilligan Jonas, Anthony Joseph, Georg Michael, and Leon Lukas are adorable boy names.|`|6SB4ufEYaa	I don't like Eileen. The rest are nice.|`|hrRh0CqNaa	Very nice! I also like Connor Alan Brock. . .|`|RP6dDFTsaa	Ryan is better|`|1bAOQbk3aa	Ryan Alan, I'm not too fond of.    I definetly like Evelyn Kate, its very pretty.    I like both Ryan and Liam, but I'd pick Ryan to be my favorite.    Olivia Eileen is iffy for me, but its a decent name.    I love the name Aidan, and Caleb is really adorable too.    Also:  Tristan  Noah  Logan  Nathan  Austin|`|QGr6BZNNaa	good choices. I prefer Liam to Ryan.|`|aRVYHsQ7aa	Definatly Liam
F8KmTbqjaa	Go ahead and take it, but don't expect it to be accurate completely.  In other words if its positive your pregnant, but if it is negative it doesn't mean you are not pregnant for sure.  I tested everyday from 5 days before my missed period and got a negative result until 6 days after my missed period when I was pregnant with my daughter!  My last pregnancy (which unfortunately ended in miscarriage) was the same thing I tested 3 days before my missed period and had a negative until 3 days after my missed period.  So the moral of the story is test when you want but don't expect an accurate result until after you miss your period!!!  Good LUck!    OH ya I was using First Response and EPT!  Both times.|`|cOqVGdL8aa	I tried to take an E.P.T. the day before my missed period and it was negative. The day I missed my period it was positive. It is def. worth it to wait. If you are really anxious buy the one with two tests. That way if its negative, you can double check in a few days.   If you are cramping it is most likely your period and most likely not pregnant. But it can also be a sign of a miscarriage if they are really severe. If they get bad and come in waves, like its tolerable than two minutes later its unbearable, go to the E.R. as this is a sign of a miscarriage. I hope it's just your period!   And if you get pain that feels different than cramps it's just your uterus stretching due to pregnancy.  Good luck to you!|`|jKMH27gKaa	Yes: I took two Clearblue Easy _/- tests and got a negative two days before my period was due. Today, on the day, I used First Response digital and got a "YES+". I think if you're going to take an early test, use First Response with morning urine, and the earliest I would do it is 2 days before due. They usually come in packs of 2 or 3 so I think you're safe tomorrow. Good luck!|`|FcYPowt4aa	Im not a doctor and i usually never answser questions. Im about 9 weeks preggers and when i was trying to get pregnant i took a lot of tests that came back negative. My last period was on dec 4 2008 and i was conceiving dec 15 through the 17 i believe. well i did not get a positive test untill the beggining of jan when i was suppose to get my period. so i would say just wait untill its closer to your next period to test yourself. you Hormone levels that you have when your pregnant need to be high enough to come back positive on the test. So good luck and just wait it out.
82ORY9UFaa	I had the same problem at the begining of the pregnancy and there is nothing to worry about. Your muscles have to stretch, it's like working out, your body is changing. You'll feel this pain every trismester or so. congratulation on the baby :D|`|tivpa7Vlaa	i don't know why u are having those pains but i tell you one thing for sure....pregnancy comes with different pains and aches|`|Xt7jo8bcaa	No u can't stop it...in time it will...u are going through alot of changes with your body...God is working inside of u..he's making your baby...right now sweety u are under construction|`|bTzw1JDwaa	I'm 6 weeks too! But i think I've had very little pain at the top of my stomach but barely anything for me to even acknowledge.|`|VD4JgFnGaa	its normal your tummy is just making room for you baby and also to go throw some changes|`|Y7sio6Yhaa	i'm sorry sweetie your stomach just hurts a lot randomly throughout the pregnancy there's nothing you can do. in fact there hasnt been a day that's gone by since getting pregnant that i can say my stomach hasn't hurt me for one reason or another. i could literally feel my stomach stretching and the next day sure enough where i felt it i had stretch marks. it sux. i dunno how but u gotta just make peace with the pain, lol, most pregnancies are full of it.|`|6988FTAYaa	i had the same kind of pain at 11 weeks and the doctor told me to eat tums and turned out i was okay! but if that doesnt work i would def. contact my doctor and talk to him about your problem.good luck and god bless
wKuQC4yTaa	it is a sign of ectoptic pregnancy.see your OB|`|K2jT1z5jaa	hey.    i adivse an ultrasound to check ectopic pregnancy. it needs to be checked, its normal if cramps are on both sides. but when its on one & sore. It needs to be checked very soon.    god bless x take care|`|jNqf8HtDaa	dont know a web site but i think it could be just where the baby is located it could be on that one side more than the other because thats how mine is|`|eV7rtxmuaa	Hey love. If your hurting on one side you should get checked out just in case you have an ectopic pregnancy. all the best|`|vaBVFsY3aa	Don't get upset by what I'm going to say, but you should go to your doctor, it can be an ectopic pregnancy. I had that, and it felt the same. As I said, don't get upset. I can be wrong. So rather go to your doctor, he will do an ultra sound.    I really hope that I'm wrong.|`|4lpJRXYsaa	i would call your doctor to make sure everything is okay, it can be nothing though because you havn't had any bleeding and you bleed when you are miscarrying, so you aren't having a miscarriage. Your uterus could be stretching to make more room for the growing baby. Babycenter.com is an AWSOME website for everything baby, all your questions, fun facts week by week, and how your baby is growing weekly, goodluck i hope everything goes smoothly, and congrats on your pregnancy :)|`|sYsfI856aa	I had this problem early on in just about every one of my pregnancies. Just the one side too, usually it turned out to be just plain old stretching of the round ligaments from the uterus growing and some dehydration.     Still, I recommend you see the doctor to check things out, until you can get in, keep relaxed, keep your feet up, and drink plenty of water!    If you start to experience any sharp back pains, bleeding, or even just pain that doubles you over, don't wait for your doctor, go into the ER and be checked. Even now if you can't get ahold of your doctor and feel more comfortable.. you can go to the ER and they will check you to be sure things are alright. I know many women feel stupid for going in for the slightest pain, but most hospitals understand our worries.    Good luck, and it sounds like things are alright to me, but you never know. Stay relaxed, and calm. Take care!|`|nic8GvOaaa	A great website I found was babycenter.com, its helped me learn alot its got alot of great information. Also i noticed you answered one of my questions and ty for that Im just the same as you im 6 weeks today, and congrats on your baby|`|6e86b83705cfddccf58af904227b4e43aa	my advice is pleeese go to the hosiptal, they're the only people that know and you can trust. you may have a real problem and their are many miscarriges that can be avoided if people see hosiptals when they have pain problem or having a feeling something isnt right.|`|y5sWmbtnaa	you should have it checked out for tubal/ectopic pregnancy , but some pain on one or both sides is completely normal. What else is normal is fear that something is wrong, especially early in pregnancy. Go ahead and call your OB/GYN or Midwife if you have one and get checked as soon as you can.
2Hhbz16maa	If it's the virus my daughter had he could have the fever for the next 3 days. Just give him the ibuprofen around the clock. At night I wake up to give it to her at the right times.|`|p7ZdohGTaa	There are lots of things that can cause things like this (virus, infection, etc.). Of course, the doctor is the best person to consult on this. He has said to use Ibuprofren and it has helped, so that is good. Sometimes, the fever will spike between doses. If the parent calls the doctor and tells the doctor that they would like to know if there is another way to control the fever, that might be a good plan. The fact that the child is playing in between may be contributing to the problem not resolving. Usually, children seem to be sicker in the evening. That is why parents usually seem to be up, at night. Fevers often spike, possibly because the child has exerted themselves during the day, or maybe because the body rhythms are different during the night. The important thing is for the parents to watch the fever and make sure it is not getting too high. They should always call the doctor, no matter what, if they have a problem or question. That is what the doctors are for. When my son was about 10 years old, he had a very mild fever. About 99.2. He would go out and play (and it was cold out), seeming normal. The fever was barely a fever, but it lasted too long for me, even though it was not too high. Finally, I took him into the doctor. He had walking pneumonia. Determined to play, but sick.You just never know just what you have. Tell them to watch whatever seems to be of concern to them. Lots of clear liquids, too. That is always supposed to be of help. When in doubt, consult the doctor - and if they don't fee comfortable with the opinion of the first doctor, consult another.|`|5f2e5da7d48269806f35d9ae5290b898aa	I have found with my children that it doesn't matter what they are sick with, it always seems to be worse at night. There have been times that they seemed completely fine during the day, and by night were sick again. It probably is a virus as the doctor suggested, and it sounds like the doctor doesn't have any plans to just blow it off if it continues. Hope he gets to feeling better!

Have fun with your little Blessing!|`|IGcS9K62aa	First of all, I completely love your names. They are very much my taste, so this is super hard!    Corrina Grace or Leah Elizabeth are my faves for the girls.   I like Corrina, because then she can go my Cori. I also love the name Leah and Elizabeth (they are both on my short list for first names for the next one)!    Connor is really cute. I am not crazy about the Joseph. James Kale is cool altogether and I love the names James. What about James Connor or Connor James?     I am sure though whatever you chose will be fantastic!!|`|0bZ6j0aSaa	Leah Elizabeth.  I also really like the first name Miriam but i'm not sure about the second name Marie with it...maybe Miriam Isobel?    For a boy, Connor Joseph is awesome!!!|`|nZjyIAVhaa	These are really really nice names you have!     Leah Elizabeth 6/10  Corrina Grace 9/10  Finley Isobel 1010 - well, I love love love both of these names, but I don't like Finley for a girl - only for a boy :S  Miriam Marie - 6/10    boys-   Landon Wyatt 2/10  Connor Joseph 9/10  James Kale 7/10  Ethan Clark 5/10    For girls I LOVE Corrina Grace.

Her name is Maddison Jean.  Good luck!   :)|`|xRJQSNJeaa	Aww all of your names are so cute. And that is so cool your due on valentines day. But anyway back to the topic of names for a Girl I like the name  Leah Elizabeth and for a boy I like Connor Joseph. Good Luck!!|`|iKLdGe1xaa	Corrina Grace or Finley Grace  James Kale or Joseph Wyatt|`|2TrHH0rkaa	Leah Elizabeth-Leah Elizabeth is gorgeous. It flows well and is fairly unique 10/10  Corrina Grace-I really like how this name flows although I am not so keen on Corrina.Leah Grace would sound great 7/10  Finley Isobel-I consider Finley a boys name. Feminine names for girls and masculine for boys are best. Isobel is a great name though 3/10  Miriam Marie-This is quite pretty although a little too old-fashioned for me 6.5/10    Landon Wyatt-Great combination 10/10  Connor Joseph-I love Irish names such as Connor. Joseph is a very nice name also 10/10  James Kale-I prefer James Wyatt but James is still an awesome name 6/10  Ethan Clark-This name flows really well. It's just alright in my opinion 6.5/10    Hope I help :)|`|EpOU7vGYaa	for girls:  i like leah, and grace  for boys:  i like james    my suggestions are  for girls: Kate, Liz, Holly, Laura.  for boys: Jay, Derek, Dave, Dan.    if i ever had two kids, 1 girl and 1 boy, i would name them Holly and Dave|`|WHAD4Ap2aa	i like leah elizabeth and connor joseph...i think its cute, and unusual is the new usual so these are perfect if you wanna be different...lol, they are cute, kind of normal yet slightly abnormal, you get the best of both worlds!|`|tHEBPDenaa	Leah Elizabeth and Landon Wyatt. I love them both.|`|igvUbqkyaa	I love Elizabeth, Isobel, and Grace - preferably Elisabeth, Isabel, and Gracie but both are gorgeous!    I am not too keen on any of the other girl names though. I guess Leah Elizabeth or Corinna Grace would be the best options. How about: Elizabeth Grace, Isobel Grace, or Grace Elizabeth?    For the boys, I love Landon, Joseph, James, and Kale (or Cale). So my favorite overall is definitely James Kale - I love that name!!|`|L1zHF8HXaa	Finley Isobel.  James Kale    even cuter names would be Harlow Winter for a girl  And Cohen James.|`|N59YQtRFaa	Leah is pretty and I love Landon...Ethan is very popular right now though. Don't pick Ethan or he will be one of many.|`|Wt3t6rUPaa	Some of the names don't roll off the tongue so nicely.  But I think Leah Marie sounds nice together  James Kale is nice too.  What about Emily for a girl?|`|wUxnDLCvaa	Leah for a girl and Connor for a boy...  Leah means Delicate in Hebrew and Connor is an Irish name meaning strong willed and wise.  Congratulations and good luck, hope everything goes smoothly and you have a healthy new baby  2/14 - Valentines Day!!|`|46ddc6b6990fcd5b5d5e36dc7b533ccaaa	I love    Leah Elizabeth    and    Ethan Clark    But ultimately its what you want!

Here soms other names you might like GIRL-Makayla Grace, Alexis Marie, Olivia Nicole                                       BOY-Connor Alexander, Lucas James, Cohen Michel.. but good luck and early Congrats!!|`|dlQEa6Y0aa	My favorite are Leah Elizabeth and James Kale.  I do not like finley isobel for a girl! finley is not cute to me, and isobel looks misspelled.|`|PjzJ9QQRaa	Leah Elizabeth  James Kale|`|Bu7gdHbwaa	Miriam Marie and Ethan Clark|`|TYRRjIv4aa	Boy:Connor Joseph   Girl:Leah Elizabeth but i would use Leaha Elisabeth|`|8fe3ZZDdaa	Not overly fond of the girls name but the best pick would be Leah Elizabeth, even better would be Leah Marie    Boys names I like Connor Joseph and Ethan, but not fond of Clark. What about Ethan James?    So my overall favs are Leah Marie, Connor Joseph and Ethan James (if I could change the names around a bit)
ii0C0tfXaa	Im 5 days over my due date, i feel like a balloon too and i gained 50 pounds! everyone says i still look good but i feel like that blueberry girl from charlie and the chocolate factory. ...well good luck and congradulations!|`|rcdTluUjaa	Patience, you are almost there, and before you know it you will be holding that little one and completely forget about how miserable you felt before.|`|e1ae2fbad2e2e19da95432269bb0ccd0aa	We ALL go through that.  The last couple weeks are always the hardest.  The baby is gaining weight like crazy while moving further down into your pelvis, your body is getting ready for labor, and all the nutrients you take in go to the growing baby so it feels like you get none of it.  Jsut keep telling yourself that your baby will be here soon.  Get as much rest as you can now, maybe start a good book or something you enjoy but know that you may not be able to do for a while once the baby is born.  I spent the last couple weeks with all three of mine creating a pre-made scrapbook so that all I had to do was add pics and maybe write some information.  It kept me busy and was great because I didnt have time to do much scrapbooking for a while after their births.    Hope this helps.  Congrats.|`|AA10526033	cried. lol. actually my first 2 were 5 wks early so i wasnt to uncomfortable. my 3rd went to 38 wks and i wanted to kill someone. i gained 40lbs was 5'2 and 170! it sucked! just do what u need to/ can do to get ready to take your mind off it. relax. your almost done!! congrats!|`|Zl3re1Vhaa	i was on bed rest at the end with my first so i worked on her scrapbook crocheted more blankets than she ever needed or used and watched movies endlessly because i was so uncomfortable that i couldn't sleep you just have to tough it out and make the best of the situation it's all you can do|`|DuLhv7Ajaa	I liked being pregnant, in fact the bigger I got the more I like it. I felt beautiful and strong because my body was doing what it was designed to do. My advice is to enjoy it and wear that belly like its a trophy!!|`|Y7sio6Yhaa	ya i feel u i'm 38 weeks and i've been getting those sharp stabbing pains down there a LOT and plus the nausea just decided to come back even though i'm on this supposedly really good nausea medication lol. i can't wait to pop ur due date is 3 days before mine. it sux i know, u pee every 20 minutes, you can barely waddle, prolly have headaches like i do, i'm now having to take hour long naps throughout the day just cuz i'm so tired lol but i'm sure the time will go by before you know it. i have a book i could be reading but i have a splitting headache so i really dont think i have the patience for that. lol. i hear teh last weeks are always teh worst. n it's hard to not resent the ones that have had their babies already like my sister in law, her due date was teh 24th of feb. and she had her baby last week. so its hard to not wanna be urgh when i think about her, i'm just jealous i wish my baby was here already. at least i know she's getting healthier every day she's in my tummy. that's really all that's keeping me going. i wonder if u'll pop before me!|`|AA11543462	just remember it all will be over and a new begining .you will be able to loose weight after it is all over !good luck!|`|fc1a879190d20993471e9ab52be8c605aa	Luckily mine came early. Right on the cusp of too early. I wouldn't have been  able to stand it. It is worth it though.|`|uLGqDh47aa	I felt miserable by the time my due date got here. Felt even more miserable when she didnt get here on it...lol. Just dont have it stuck in your mind that he/she will be here on that day. I did and that was the worst mistake ever. i had to be induced at 41w3d bc nothing was changing. my body just needed a kick in the rear to get labor started. the best advice i can give you is to just keep yourself busy(make sure to get plenty of rest too, it'll be the last bit of good rest you'll get for a while) and dont dwell on when the baby will get here. Good luck hun!        btw, i'm the same height and weighed almost the same|`|J38v75bvaa	lol. i was a week late and my boy was 9lbs 12oz!!!     i spent my time in the bath cuz my tummy itched so much. i talked alot to my friends and went to the mall alot so i could walk and try to get him out!!    good luck...all the discomfort is so worth it tho.|`|jUUl9Gi8aa	just think about how much closer ur lilo angel will be here!!!  every pound is worth it i gained 40lbs with my son and im back to what i was before i had him.  just look at the best part!!|`|WbJPQM1naa	Well, you have to have patience.  I heard somewhere that we really have to get a strong determination to have our baby OUT a few weeks before they actually come so that we can psychologically be ready to give birth.  So, now that YOU are determined, lets have this baby, already, huh?  I had seven and I know how you feel.      Just be thankful for things as they are, day by day.  Read some more good info about childbirth.  Watch this great film I found called "Pregnant in America".  It's a real eye opener!  Sleep!  You're gonna need to rest now while you can.  Take some nice hot soaks and watch your belly rumble.  I used to love that!  Don't forget to drink plenty of water and have your good protein every day.      You'll be there before you know it, and you will be surprised at how quickly your pregnancy went!  Looking back, I was!    Here's the link to this wonderful video.  Message me if you have any questions or comments.  http://www.megavideo.com/?v=QTRRAG2A    Take good care and congrats, you're almost to the finish line!    R|`|qmmu6hv5aa	My due date is 2/23 and i'm going NUTS!!!!

I'm 185 as well and i just want to get my body back!!
MXXOICquaa	i get those and i dont even have to move fast, i actually asked my doctor about it today and he said do stretches regularly and it should help but i dont know if it works because he just told me this today|`|xOr67VDiaa	It can be normal, maybe you stretched  it to quick, ive had it b4 and it freaked me out, but im pretty sure it has to do with moving to fast.. try and take your time. good luck tc|`|jNqf8HtDaa	just your ligaments stretching out     i wouldn't worry about it     good luck|`|75c4fd1f4d2f05c3f64c60714f6b13d8aa	normally those are normal, i get those sometimes if i bend down really fast. If they last longer or have any bleeding get to the er or the doc. Best of luck!|`|yWFKNgNCaa	I've gotten quite a few pains getting up, especially if I use my legs, to kind of "swing" up or whatever, I've read its perfectly fine, because you're ligaments & everything are stretching & whatnot.|`|rkSBHqtQaa	Hi, I know how bad those sharp pains feel.I had that with both my pregnancies and I was told by my doctor that,its just your ligaments stretching to help support the extra weight your carrying on your belly. Its totally normal. Congrats on your baby and good luck with the pains.
484fd75888bbb282b3da584ad880893aaa	Kyle Oatie and Beth Mint.

So hopefully that's what you were going for.|`|aNIiGpzeaa	ummmmm.......get off the crack and start thinking of REAL names for that poor, innocent baby|`|11a1ca6e5344b05fcc0a1be08c886a49aa	this is a joke right?  please, for the sake of your child, don't name them ANY of the names listed above     Frank Further, really? a hot dog??????!!!???|`|TGUoZF63aa	Beth Mint is stunning!|`|jrUGUNaeaa	it sounds stupid  it also sounds like a joke
jOyzcJd7aa	No I think its totally normal! Esp. if we see babies all over the place! I'm sure your smart enough to wait till you can support one. Just have fun practicing till then lol.|`|LQpU6Zd8aa	Get a dog or a cat, don't get pregnant right now.   It's probably a phase you are going through right now and needs a long and serious bit of thinking out and planning. You have all your life to have a kid but you're only young and relatively unfettered once. Continue with college and have a baby after you graduate and get a job you want.  You two are still in college and nothing can side track a college education like a baby. You would have to miss time to have the baby and in all likelihood you would have to cut back and/or drop out to raise the baby and believe me planning to restart school once you take a break from it just doesn't seem to materialize for most people there is always someone to take care of or some bill that needs paid so you will end up without your diploma and without the job your had dreamed of or planned to have when you started college.  I know too many women who have a child while in college and it's always the woman who has to put her career and/schooling on hold sometimes the man even decides that a wife and child are a hindrance to them having the big shining career they want and end up dumping the woman.    I just read the update you did. WTG!! on the 4.0 GPA and also I think you have a good head on your shoulders for planning to wait, and again YES you are normal, I used to "dream" about having a baby but like another poster said, I am so glad I waited because it gave me time to adjust to working and building my career and well...just to enjoy life before I settled down and became a wife and mom.|`|6hb04Ow0aa	It's not weird at all. It's probably not a phase either, it's completely normal for us to be all maternal and everything. Whenever you are ready to have a baby you will know what's best and when it's the right time :D|`|jHUAfrojaa	I totally understand the engaged to be engaged thing, that's how my Marine and I are right now.    The longing for a baby thing is a phase. I went through it while my boyfriend was in boot camp. You'll eventually get over it. If you know someone who has a baby, as if you can watch them for them while they go out and enjoy themselves. I promise you, you will want to hold off on the baby thing. Shoot, you can have one of my nephews! lol|`|uZnnCjJ0aa	wow  we have a lot in common  when i was in college i did the same  i couldnt wait to have a baby   i was totally obsessed  infact i flipin chose all the prams i wanted  how the room is going to look  how the clothes its going to wear  and i sound more obsessive  i was still in college and i wasnt even engaged to be engaged!  its normal and go with the flow it perfect that your mind wants to settle|`|r39EDGhPaa	No, it's not a phase.  A lot of girls get that "maternal instinct" thing, haha.  I'm lucky I haven't encountered that yet.    Good luck with college, and your engagement to be engaged :)|`|6L9jJnchaa	Get married and try that out first.  No one should be intentionally having kids before marriage.    Edit:  Why does everyone think you have to drop out of college if you have kids?  I'm in school full time...there's this thing called daycare, you know.|`|ZvU093GPaa	I would have to say no that's not a phase . its more like family planning at the worst time.|`|ch8vuSMGaa	The question you're asking is if its normal.  Yes, its normal.  I felt the same way through college and so did a lot of my friends.  It is normal to be excited about having a baby, especially if you know who you want to spend your life with!  But I can also tell you that I waited until I graduated from college and I am SO happy that I did because a baby is so much more expensive than I could have ever imagined.  But don't worry... you're normal! :)|`|TK0HKu0Iaa	You're doing so well CONGRATS on the 4.0 GPA. Being that you are doing so well w/ what you currently have on your plate I think you should wait. What you and your boyfriend are feeling is completely normal...you're fantasizing about a future life together w/ a family of your own someday. Nothing wrong with that.    I would definitely wait until finished w/ school. It can be done but it is hard to do and poses many challenges b/c the baby will always come first b/f studies, exams, classes, etc. Daycares cost $$$ and they close on oddball days at times, babies get sick/ have sleepless nights...stuff happens. Full Time Job + Full Time Classes + Full Time Mom = Alot of Stress    That's one load I am extremely grateful to have finished and not have to worry about while pregnant w/ my first child.|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	It is not weird.  But, Once you get pregnant and start having cravings by  doing something like peanut butter n' Dill pickles or, mayonnaise n strawberries...that is weird.|`|R0KEbgJGaa	Your still in college and you want a baby? This is really a tough and difficult decision, this I cannot answer you as the best answer is really what you think. But before you make your decision think about your future with a baby and another future without a baby until you get a degree. And think about what you do with a baby and when you have a baby when your older.|`|l6jfVYVvaa	YES AND FIGHT IT. YOU NEED TO BE A COUPLE FIRST.YOU HAVE PLENTY OF TIME FOR BABIES.  FINISH SCHOOL AND ENJOY THE FREEDOM TO COME AND GO WITH NO LUGGAGE. ALOT OF TIMES A GUY SPLITS WHEN THE GIRL BECOMES PREGNANT BECAUSE IT IS SO MUCH OF A LOAD. MAKES THEM FEEL OLD AND THEY DECIDE NOT TO BE TIED DOWN. ENJOY SUMMER CLOTHES THAT SHOW YOUR TONED BELLY -NOT STRETCH MARKS,
7ORTCKdraa	I've had mine out for 5 months now after having it in for over 3 years. AF is very light. I don't know if my 1st AF even was a true menstrual cycle since it lasted a day and was more like spotting. That happened about a week after removal, then it was about 35 days until the next one. Each one since then has been 2-3 days, and much lighter than before Mirena. TTC  2 with no luck so far.|`|0e6fa23141272b373c829e726aefc736aa	i took mine out 5 mounths ago and havent had a period since then cant even get pregnant

Xayen - means "waterfall" in some language (I forget which one)  Axyl/Axel  Brice/Bryce/Bryson (like "Brian's son")  Xander  Ian (last 3 letters of Brian and sounds like ending of Xyleane)  Kyle (K from duKe)  Duane (DU from DUke, ANE from xyleANE)  Deane/Dean  Keane/Kean/Kian    I know you said boy, but I thought of some girl names anyway...  Brianne/Breanne  Brileane/Brilea/Bria  Alexa/Elyxa  Kyleane/Kylea|`|iKLdGe1xaa	Think about the child with the Xyleane name.

DuLhv7Ajaa	My third baby was delivered by emergency c-section at 36 weeks. I had HELLP syndrome class one, I and my son were literally dying. My husband was told that night that he may not see his wife again, so he needed to prepare for that. My doctor had to cut me very high up on my belly, in hopes of getting my incision to clot up and close like it should. Every time I see my scar it reminds me of how blessed I am to be here and that my son is here too. It reminds me also to be grateful that I live in a country that has the medical advances that it does.  So to answer your question, no my scar does not bother me, it reminds me that I'm alive.|`|4604flr2aa	No, I dont' get embarrassed or feel unpretty about my scar.  I've also given birth to two babies via the same incision area and I actually love my scar.  :)  It's the entry point where my two beautiful babies made their debut into this world... I love it and I'm proud of it, actually!  :)  I never thought I'd be able to have children and now I have TWO!!  Amazing!  My scar is also very clean looking... very thin and not that noticeable unless you are looking for it.  ;-)|`|0nIwKd5Uaa	I have a lot of stretch marks. Are they ugly depends. The stretch marks showed i was pregnant and that my body carried my children. So I personally wear my stretch marks with honor. For me saying that they are unsightly or ugly means i feel the same way towards my pregnancy and i don't i feel honored to have carried all of children. Stretch marks and c-section scars are a badge of honor.|`|uLGqDh47aa	I've never had the c-section. But i know how you feel about the scars being embarrassing. I have very severe stretch marks on my tummy from my daughter, they got even worse in my last few weeks of pregnancy as i got that puppps rash. It seems like the smaller my tummy gets, the worse the scars look. I'm even too embarrassed for my husband to see them, they make me feel unattractive and ugly. I tried using bio-oil to reduce them, which helped some, but the smaller my tummy gets, the more they show thru and the worse they look. They're sooooo deep looks like my belly has hideous wrinkles. I cant stand it. If you hear of anything good to get rid of scars...id love to hear about it, ill try anything|`|AA11543462	no i am not embarrassed !i have had two  csections.my two surgery's were not easy only because i am diabetic. but no my scars are not bad at all!|`|6988FTAYaa	nah i dont get embarrassed cause it just means i have a wonderful child and i wouldnt have that spot unless he wasnt here!! im planned for another c-section aug1st and i just cant wait to get it over with..|`|dtwkBXv3aa	well if u reeeeally want the scars to go away and fix your tummy the most effective way is surgery. i believe a tummy tuck works in this scenario. but of course very drastic.
AA11091233	Good question!    He/she needs an extensive amount of exercise...preferrably outdoors. Make them walk/run around out side, around the block as much as possible.     Also use stimulating games/toys that engage their creativity...paints, playdough etc.      Keep a food diary over the course of a week or 2. You might notice their behaviour changing especially after eating sugar, the red color dye, gluten, wheat, diary. These have been shown to increase hyperactivity in children.    You can also give him/her a high quality fish oil...and also Papaya Enzymes (chewable). These have been shown to help child with hyperness.    You might have to enlist friends or family to take him out for an hour a day or something and just run him tired. I know and totally understand how difficult it is to deal with...but he will be or could be in pre-school soon and that should also help him gain more social skills and an outlet...as hyper children are most usually highly intelligent...they just don't know what to do with their energy.    And lastly..make sure you have very, very clear and consistent boundaries as to what is acceptable behavior and what is not. He may need more one on one time with you or your husband....even 20 minutes of extreme attention and fun and love and positive engagement can do wonders as well...as they typically get their attention from all their bad behavior and people tend to want to avoid them. However, the more positive feedback he gets...it possibly will help matters for you all.    Take care and hope some of this helps.|`|23be963eb1028d7ae0b0e466b5716e56aa	let him do what he wants until he gets tired.. then pamper him... don't get angry with him... but be sure to watch him from time to time... it's natural for growing up children...|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	why control them?|`|e1ae2fbad2e2e19da95432269bb0ccd0aa	My three year old is very hyper.  We make time to do activities that he is able to get some energy out.  We either go to the park, take the dogs for a walk, go to the place that has bouncy houses, or go for hikes.  We do this about mid morning and I have noticed that he isn't as hyper the rest of the day.|`|P8VoBR0saa	let them run outside or find something they can put their energy into like helping you bake cookies or painting a poster board or playing a game, something that will make their mind keep working and it might work  hope this helps!|`|7mGN5xU1aa	threaten that you'll drop them off at the orphanage if they dont behave
jvW3a5GYaa	The most important thing you'll ever do is raise your children - it's of paramount importance to do it right and be good at it!!|`|7rCeCVl2aa	My view is that it is very important. I don't sit around thinknig about how I can be a worse parent...|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	its very important?|`|OxFV92hJaa	There is no other option. I did not make it this far to screw things up. I refuse to accept doing a piss poor job. If I wanted to do that, then I wouldn't have had kids.|`|N072Uv3Taa	If you have children, your focus should be on the children and doing what is best for them always. Children learn what they are taught...and what by example. The more "good" we show them, the better people they will be to themselves and others. VERY IMPORTANT.

NoUkTQCgaa	She may have been "happy" about the choice she made, but Im sure it was still a gut wrenching decision and a huge loss....and is a sad day, even if she did not act like it was.       Its like adoptive parents who have "Gotcha Day" party. How insensitive.     I think a phone call that says, "hey, I was thinking about you today" is a nice idea. Balloons and stuffed animals is a bit much, almost seems like a mockery.|`|J6vd8Gsbaa	If it is an open adoption perhaps try to contact the family and ask to bring the mom by to see her. If not then ma by a stuffed toy or get a picture of the baby|`|c08708aebaf627e023dde432dde5dc5aaa	Take her out for a nice dinner...|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	Do you know the family that adopted her? Maybe you could ask them for a picture of her little girl and have it blown up and framed?|`|a095159fe0597a1cbcdff915d247b333aa	Yeah, I agree with Linny.  Balloons, teddy bears, etc, is a little over the top.  There's no telling how she will feel when the anniversary rolls around, even if she is happy with the decision she made.      I agree.  A call to say you are thinking of her today would be a caring and sensitive thing to do.|`|3X4i5Whvaa	I doubt she is as happy as she is acting.    Nature doesn't design mothers and children to be separated.    Birthdays are especially hard. You could ask her what she might like.    A "thinking of you card" might be good, because it lets her know you care, without pushing too hard.    Before my son and I were reunited, I used to quietly celebrate his birthday with a friend or two.   We did not have an open adoption.|`|fhnq3qZtaa	Condoms!!! So that she will not sin and have another baby out of wedlock!!!       Jennifer  Adoptee|`|RrgQUT5vaa	If it's an open adoption, is it not possible that she could visit her daughter on that day?    Maybe she needs a girl's night out to celebrate AND maybe keep her mind on the positive and not the loss she might feel on that day.  I think that even if she is happy with her decision, she will feel loss and her child's birthday every year.|`|yDWcYXl5aa	Take her to dinner and a movie.  Make it an enjoyable evening, without too much celebration, nor too much moodiness.  Ask her what movies she likes, and then go.|`|rbv1FH62aa	Who celebrates the surrender of their own child???|`|2P2K0rl2aa	I am a biological mother.  If somebody came bearing balloons (or cards or whatever), and wanted to celebrate my relinquished son's birthday, I would slap them up the side of the head - even if I had to climb a ladder to do it.    Yes there are good things that can come out of adoptions, but celebrating a child's birthday when the child is not present is rubbing salt into the wound.  Sure she may be comfortable with her decision, but unfortunately that doesn't stop the pain and the grieving she must be going through.    Just don't do it.  Only do something like that if she suggested it first - you just don't know where she's at emotionally, and you should leave it up to her to tell you.    Hey Jennifer:  Who died and made you God?  Yes a condom would have been handy in the past, but a sock for your mouth is needed at present.|`|1uCZFaR2aa	I agree that a gift may be too much.  Is there any way that you could donate money to an organization or name a star after the child?  That sounds kind of cheesy, but depending on the person, it may be nice.  even one of thos name a brick programs, like at the zoo or historical landmark that your friend visits?|`|7JEojMgQaa	Birthdays are the very worst day of the year for a surrendering mother. EVEN IF YOU DID MAKE THE DECISION TO SURRENDER YOURSELF. I would think a phone call and see if she would like to get out for a while would be a great idea. If she seems to be handling it well, them do a toast or something. If she isn't handling it well leave it alone. I surrendered of my own free will and birthdays were the worst. Ithe first was so bad that I literally blocked out the next 10. I would remember every day for the week before, and then the day after, but the day of, I had some how forgotten. Don't buy a present, offer your company and see how it goes, if it's a bad day for her she has you to comfort her, if it's a good day you can party a little even if its with pizza and soda.|`|S5Lsbh0taa	You sound like a good friend. how about a day out for lunch, do something girly and to a movie or something like that. Just don't over do it.    If she's sending her child a birthday present maybe you could go shopping with her for it. just to be there in case it becomes hard for her to do or just would like a second opinion. Your right in saying people have no right to judge her. Even here. The choice is made, the time for going back and changing her mind has passed, so now she needs real friends around her who won't make her feel guilty for it, or run salt into any wounds she has deep inside about it.    (My kids receive Christmas presents and birthday presents from their birth mother. She picks out things carefully for them. One was a little silver bracelet with her name (eldest childs ) engraved on it. Its a very special thoughtful gift.)    All the best!|`|MSbOJjEFaa	a babby|`|P2yRAWiJaa	Do a build-a-bear that would be age appropriate for a 1 yr old girl. It will remind your friend of her daughter and won't be sad.|`|gBEq0zo5aa	Unless your friend still speaks of this- and has spoken of it recently, I wouldn't bring it up because it is a little sad and she will likely have sad feelings about missing her baby's first birthday even though she knows she made the right choice. It might be better if you plan something to do together as friends instead of bestowing a gift on her that might later remind her of her sadness.|`|511e806a702f7f4b678843ad2696165faa	Honestly, just be there to support her.  I would say no gifts or activities.  I would just go over to her house and perhaps watch some cheesy movies with her and have a good talk.  Her choice of topics though.  She may not be ready to "celebrate" something like this.|`|E7MgO2pZaa	I agree with the others in saying you shouldn't buy gifts, but just offer your friendship and let her know you're there for her.|`|5SCKHiPAaa	How about you take her out to a nice restaurant? :-) Then tell her you guys can go anywhere and do whatever she wants. She can see a movie, shop, beauty salon, .... etc. I think her not being alone would be a great gift for her.|`|caAZdcMuaa	How about a car that says "Momy, why did you give me away?"|`|93Rbgno0aa	Since your friend is living with her mother and the mother's boyfriend (and the drugs and the drinking), and they all give her trouble about the adoption, I would think a phone call and an offer to get her out of the house for a few hours would be ok.  Honestly, not just on her baby's birthday. Get her away from them as often as possible. They don't need to support her decision, but now that the decision has been made the harping about it isn't going to make things better.     I would say not to make any special mention of the fact that it's the baby's birthday. She'll know it without your mentioning it. She'll know why you called that day, and if she wants to talk about it she can.|`|fPFXJr3eaa	Hi there...    I am a mum who lost her child unwillingly to adoption and her first birthday was hell for me.  I had a birthday party for her though and invited 30 odd people and although most of them didn't know what to say about the situation they were pretty good at just being supportive.    I guess a lovely card with a heartfelt message would go a long way... it always did for me.  It shows you are thinking of her and you are acknowledging that the day is special to her.  My best friend gave me a locket and engraved mine and my daughter's name in it and I still wear it to this day (11 years later).|`|993127072b7a2a0e8c555efdb241a674aa	no presents. nope, none. i dont care how well the adoption went.     i am one of those 'good' adoptions you speak of....and Lori A (above poster) is my bmom.....you see how painful it was for her. she still struggles with my birthday. she can never remember what day it is, she literally went into shut down for years on that day. its hard for her to be comfortable with that day, even if its 36 years later.    call her, buy a tub of ice cream and a movie. but most of all....LET HER START IT. do not go in there saying flowery things about the whole day. let her lead and you follow. if tears come you step up with tissues and comfort food. if laughs and warm feelings come you follow with hugs and laughs. but you have to let her lead.

Cu8svhwAaa	I would definitely check into some lessons for her. It is best if she works with her skills early so that later she can be really good or know if she wants to continue or not. I think it's whenever the child shows interest!|`|Kpn4xceEaa	classes now - my 2 1/2 year old son is in art and music class and he absolutely LOVES them  He has learned a lot and has soooo much fun! He loves to dance, so I'm planning on enrolling him in dance class when he's 3 (THAT my husband in not thrilled about:) )|`|8HmULotpaa	Most dance studio's start proper lessons at the age of 3.  Kids benefit a lot from doing classes early.  It teaches them about being in a group environment with a teacher and other kids.  It helps develop their coordination, balance, flexibility and develops all their congnitive skills like concentration, learning ability and memory.  School teachers often report that kids who have done an activity like dancing or gymnastics at 3 or 4 have an easier time when they start school.    The classes are fun at this age, the teachers use fun music and props and introduce varies games and activities to help them more.|`|AA10526033	id wait just a month or so stleast to make sure she does show an interest in it and not just copying something she has seen on tv. it also depends on your kid, is she shy? if so id wait and just dance around the house. if she does really like it she will still like it yrs from now! my 6 yr old has been dancing since she was 2. never put her in lessons but we still have fun with it now 21 month old sister thinks she is a dancing queen! we have fun jut dancing together. bonding plus no extra money spent!

At that age, it's more about meeting new people, learning to listen to a teacher, and learn a few basics. My older daughter takes ballet and my younger daughter will start next year when she is 3. I'm so excited and can't wait for her to start.|`|b6fIIIhZaa	Hey that sounds wonderful. I would put her in classes now.

cl6r8cGBaa	when i was a kid, i remember a usual situation same as your daughter, i was afraid of h2o to enter my ears. my mom just put some oil around my ears and she reassured me that no water will enter my ear.. yep! that did the trick for me.|`|TZN0v8r4aa	Try this, tell her to help you count how many cups of water that go over her head.  If she puts her head back then it'll go quicker and have her pick a number to see if you can get all the soap out in that number.  Let her always pick the number first and then sometimes pick a higher number or lower number to make it into a game.  I used to babysit this little girl with really long hair so we had to say 10 cups of water or whatever unless she was in the shower.  You could also try that.  They can control the water better that way or it doesn't seem to fall forcefully over her face.  Just turn on the shower so she can rinse her hair or have her dump the water on her head by herself.|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	the only thing I found that works is those hand held shower- heads with the hose thingy..let her control the water ..she may like to rinse her own hair and eventually squirt herself in the face and laugh..Make it fun and NEW!

I can get mommy wet too!"|`|BUI9HnH1aa	why looking after my friends kids i noticed this as well   so i went out and brought them some goggles to wear in the bath .. it does make it a little bit difficult to wash the hair , but it stops the screaming when the soap and water gets in their eyes|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	Use Johnson's baby shampoo.

You could give her some eye goggles,like the kind they might wear in the pool?|`|Kpn4xceEaa	my son hates it, too  I tell him that I can rinse the shampoo from his hair with 3 cups of water and we count them (he tilts his head back) - knowing what's coming seems to help  I also dry his face right after    Good luck!|`|Cu8svhwAaa	My son doesn't mind if I just quickly pour the water over his head and get it all done but if I spend any extra time he will suddenly stand up and try to bolt from the tub.  He won't lie down in the bath on his back either because the water will get in his ears.  His 11 month old brother lies back constantly and I try to convince him he's a big boy and could do it also but he won't.     I would suggest maybe just wetting a wash cloth and using it to wet her hair and then to wipe the soap out of it, as if she were a newborn.  Other than that I don't know what to suggest to make it any easier.|`|OkXN7gmeaa	my daughter is the same way... she accidentally jumped into a fountian( freak accident college kids put detergent in and she was playing with bubbles, she didn't realise there was water under, i was within arms reach) anyways i give her the choice of how i rinse, washcloth, cup or showerhead. she chooses washcloth. i tell her if she keeps her chin up then i won't get water in her ears or eyes...but that if she looks down there is nothing i can do. if she does look down i stay calm and wring out the cloth to dry her eyes...i also realized my husband and sister disregard her fear and just dump water on her head, if someone else baths her make it perfectly clear they are not to disregard her feelings...|`|AR3ex2Rtaa	At walmart in the baby section they should have a cup with a rubber/plastic part where the water pours out with a handle. In my store it's by the potty seats. I used that for my nephew when he didn't want the water in his eyes when I gave him a bath and it worked great. The plastic/rubber part allows you to put the container to their head and it keeps the water off their faces - except of course if they tip their head down. Good luck - he grew out of it though, I taught him how to blow bubbles in the water and he didn't mind the water splashing his face after a while. It works better if you make it a game or make it funny if they get their face wet.|`|BwIBMDfLaa	i am going through the same thing with the 3 year old i watch.  here's what has worked for me:    -letting him do it (if you don't mind it not being done perfect)  - making it a game (chase them with the water and they will start laughing and forget)  - let them hold a wash rag while you do it so you can get any water out of their eyes    i don't really understand it either.  he has the tear proof baby shampoo so that is not it.|`|27c9c3ed2f06137b2d1f89d440c6c042aa	Mine is 3 and has always been terrified of washing her hair.

Good luck.|`|Xrwvu5Uraa	www.babiesrus.com    and you can even register online    good luck|`|uhBkbgoaaa	SERIOUSLY IF YOURE ASKING FOR THE BEST THEN IT HAS TO BE BABIES R US|`|0LWToISqaa	I don't know if they have them in your area but USA Baby has great furniture!|`|D5dS539yaa	You may also want to check out   http://www.homelement.com/products/Baby-...    Good luck!
NaT5dYU1aa	http://www.parents.com/baby/nursery/    I really like going to Pottery Barn for Kids ( either online or at the mall).  Someone told me something interesting about their furniture:  it's made by Bass but so is Target's - and it is very similar.  I would get ideas from Pottery Barn, buy something similar at Target and some items at Pottery Barn. I saved a bunch but it still looked like it all came once place. To give you an idea, I bought a crib at Target for about $220.  My friend bought an almost identical one at Pottery Barn for $1200.  She was mad but I was glad!  :)  Congratulations, too!|`|lUY7Bfzcaa	Walmart or Babies r us thats where I got minee! :)
jNqf8HtDaa	6 inches long and 1/2 pound|`|Xrwvu5Uraa	yeah every website/book will tell you differently. it's always in the range of what you are. the american pregnancy association which is an .org (organization) Website. which is something to trust rather then a .com(commerical) website. they go by saying your baby is about 7oz. and 7 in. right now.     http://www.americanpregnancy.org/weekbyw...    congrats & good luckkk!    always try to come in contact with a .gov .edu or .org website when dealing with medical issues/pregnancy!!|`|Y7sio6Yhaa	that's weird usually the websites and books tend to say around the same thing. so i dunno where u've read but they're gonna be the most accurate not that anybody will be able to tell you.|`|xeS8pUfbaa	when i was 19 weeks and 6 days pregnant [about 20 weeks] i had an ultrasound she was 12 oz|`|TDOfjYGBaa	At my 20 week ultrasound he weighed just under 1 lb which is normal i didn't get a length but i was told his head was 5 cm in diameter and his themer bone was 3 cm. hope that helps at least a lil.    otherwise go to www.babygaga.com and pregnancy calendar: week 19|`|Cu8svhwAaa	In a week or so you should be having your anatomy scan (ultrasound) they can probably estimate about how much the baby weighs and how long it is.|`|fjeFBGlqaa	babycenter.com is the best place..they are dead on with everything|`|hamdnq5Yaa	every baby is different.
ZcrsqMbcaa	lol|`|lMvwVvqbaa	i think some of them are crazy. like last night show that little girl who won in the 5-6 category had too much makeup on. and the little two year old cried the whole time. I would not do that to my child. I would put my daughter in a contest but only if she was having fun and no makeup.If she wasn't having fun or looked like a little trained barbie I would stop it. I do plan to let my daughter do pagents but only if she enjoys them and wants too. it is just the fun of it. pagents for children shouldn't be all about trophies and crowns.|`|YJ4BFphTaa	I think its horrible - let them be normal kids for goodness sakes, and toddlers for that matter.|`|OkXN7gmeaa	i imagine that dressing kids up like dolls can be addictive and that at some point parents loose sight of the reason they started doing it in the first place, for the kids to have fun and to meet other parents. i see it to be very much like muchausen syndrome by proxy...attention is very addictive|`|BwIBMDfLaa	there is something wrong with those people.  they hide that the kids have missing teeth.  every kid has missing teeth.    they make their kids spend ridiculolous amounts of time training for some pointless contest.      i think they just want the prize for themselves.    i think if the kid enjoys it, then yes.  but not to the extent they push it.|`|8407d42497f1b24965e83fbdc3e72bd8aa	i don't agree with it AT ALL, its wrong to exploit children in this way.. these kids will grow up trying to be the image of perfection and end up depressed that they can't always live up to that. DISGUSTING. just a thought though.|`|6pLLPdPwaa	I think the ones who force their children to do it need help. Especially the ones that dress them up like adults. It is ridiculous. On the other hand, the ones who do it naturally and just for fun don't seem that bad.|`|SsfnitjXaa	Fat moms trying to relive their life through their little girls.
BVaOnbo2aa	If this appt is with a non-OB/GYN, then they'll just have you take a pee test to confirm your pregnancy, ask if you have any concerns, then they will give you a referral to an OB/GYN.     If this is your OB/GYN appt, then first, they'll give you a long questionnaire regarding your sexual and medical history. It will also ask all sorts of questions regarding family medical history from diabetes to high blood pressure, to TB, ethnicity, smoking, birth defects in family, alcohol, etc. With enough factors, they may refer you to a genetic counselor or nutritionist on the side (besides your regular OB appts.    They will take a pee sample (this will be the standard everytime you enter their office). They will either draw blood or send you with a slip to the lab to check your blood type and some other things. They will likely do a pap smear and pelvic exam as well, and depending on how far along you are, they may also do a baby doppler (listening for heartbeat--may be too early though) and an ultrasound to check.    Then they'll go over anything you may be of risk for depending on your age and medical history, as well as ethnic background of the baby.    --------------  I was counseled regarding Down Syndrome as well as diabetes possibilities early on. Eventually, I did get an amnioscentesis done due to ultrasound 'soft markers' which scared the hell out of us, but all turned out normal! And while I never had diabetes before, they were right and now I am shooting up insulin daily. So far, I have labeled this the year of the needles. But I'm glad because my baby-to-be is doing fine. I average 1-2 doctors appts per week now and I'm at 21 weeks.|`|Xrwvu5Uraa	they weighed me (which is done every appointment), took my height. did my vitals. they will probably take your blood. do a papsmear/physical. explain everything and how they do everything and all the emergencey numbers and go through everything with you. your 1st prenatal appt is the longest. good luck & cngrats.|`|xOr67VDiaa	It's a great feeling, i loved all mine.. unless you get nasty ppl.. you'll love it. if you get nasty ppl, stand up for yourself!! there is always an old grumpy person lol good luck and make sure you enjoy it.|`|muoZBAd6aa	Pretty much ask you a BUNCH of questions and what not..|`|jNqf8HtDaa	its pretty easy.    blood test  urinalysis   and maybe an internal exam or a regular sonogram|`|Y7sio6Yhaa	it depends but most likely they'll do another pregnancy test to confirm, and pap smear and get all ur private info etc. i thought they would do like an ultra sound or something cool like that but alas no.|`|jKMH27gKaa	IF you are going for your 8-week confirmation appointment, my doc's at least uses ultrasound to confirm the fetus is present (and you may see the heart beat!), and then they will advise you on what you should avoid/do in the first trimester. They may send you for genetic counseling with a specialist who will address any concerns about birth defects (this is standard at my doc's but not everyone does this). They will send you to the lab for initial bloodwork and arrange to see you every month until you hit about 30 or 34 weeks, and then it will be weekly. Good luck!|`|fjeFBGlqaa	well i did paperwork...blood work....pap smear....stuff like that. if you go get the book "what to expect when expecting" it tells you everything your doctor will do at each visit!|`|b6fIIIhZaa	They will ask you questions about family medical history and yourself and then take you to get a urine sample and then have you strip down into a gown and check your down below and make sure your cervix and everything are good and then do a vaginal ultrasound. Good luck mommy to be!|`|czTl9q8Oaa	well i did paperwork,blood work,pap smear!  good luck!  : )|`|Agad3Oc4aa	Well the first appt they are going to do a pregnancy test on you to confirm that you are pregnant.    Depending on how far you are will determine what they will do next.      They will do the usual like you do for any doctor's visit.  Height, weight, pressure and ask you questions about your medical history to determine if they may be any risk for you or your baby.      They will ask for you to do a HIV test but it's totally voluntary and if you are AA they will do a sickle cell test on you and then ask if your partner carries the trait and ask for them to be tested as well.      They will ask the date of your last period to estimate your due date.  But this will be temporary until they are able to do your sonogram at about 12 weeks which will give them a better prediction of your due date.      If you are 10 weeks or more and this is your first visit they will do something so that you can hear your baby's heart beat.  this will help them determine if your baby's heart beat is regular.    If you are 4 months or more pregnant and this is your first doctors visit they will do a sonogram on you.    Then they will talk to you about the best nutrition for you and your baby and schedule your next doctor's appt.  Which will be once a month until you are 7 months.  Then it becomes every two weeks and then when you are 36 weeks you will go once a week.    Hope this was helpful
ODZeyNYMaa	I got pregnant on my honeymoon, which happened to coincide with my period! You can get preggers anytime, even if your period is like clockwork (mine was).   Good Luck, I hope it turns out the way you want!|`|CRVi3YsOaa	when my bff had her first daughter, she looked at her dates, and the days she had intercourse and according to all of that she actually got pg on her period, i know gross. but she thought you couldn't get pg then and her 7 yr old daughter would tell you different.
9CoTDEKVaa	Yes, you can be pregnant if you had unprotected sex! If your period is coming soon, take a pregnancy test if it is late. Sometimes pregnancy symptoms can relate to period symptoms too. Just try and relax, the more you freak yourself out about being pregnant, its going to stress you out and then its going to delay your period. A missed period is usually the first symptom of being pregnant, just to let you know :]    If your pregnancy test comes back negative if your period is late, and you don't want to get pregnant, you should go see a doctor and go on birth control. It's the only way not to become pregnant besides abstinence. And just a reminder, birth control is not 100% effective, so use a condom to protect you from that little chance of ending up pregnant!      Good luck!|`|82ORY9UFaa	These are the symptoms of pregnancy but it takes more than a week to "feel" them. Defitively... If you are worried, buy a test.|`|uu1IUxAkaa	congrats, I hope the babie daddie will stay.|`|5yAsj29Vaa	Way too early for symptoms.  Implantation can take up to 2 weeks.  Your belly doesn't even get hard until the 2nd trimester, so it's definitely in your head.    Of course, pregnancy can result from unprotected sex.|`|Spm9Raz9aa	you wouldnt be having these symptoms this early.|`|jNqf8HtDaa	i would say your pregnant those sound exactly like what you would go through|`|GrgNm1Ofaa	Go to walgreens and take a 10$ test.  You could be kind of sick and making it worse by thinking your pregnant but aren't.|`|AA10526033	um could be just from having unprotected sex but as that was only what 9 days ago you wouldnt be feeling any of that yet bout a month or 3 too early! is your period due in say a week?|`|d5VQTRDFaa	Yes, you happen to be pregnant,please view my source below.|`|uVTosLc9aa	You definately could be pregnant, the best thing to do is to take a home test. If you have missed your period and get a negative test, wait a few days, maybe a week, and take it again. If it is still negative and you still feel like this, go see your doctor. Any time you have unprotected sex there is the possibility of pregnancy. You wouldnt be able to tell by your belly being hard this early on.
CRVi3YsOaa	the depo-provera shot. it is a birth control shot|`|cOqVGdL8aa	It means I'm on the shot. As in the birth control shot.|`|lMvwVvqbaa	the are on the depo shot. As in the birth control shot you get every three months.|`|hmOidFp3aa	Its depro-provera. The shot is given every 3 months as a birth control method. It gets rid of your period all together!|`|XyRzSzjtaa	its the birth control injection i think????? i may sound thick aswell but im new to this and all the abreviations.lol.
Xrwvu5Uraa	http://www.echostore.com/fetal-doppler-b...      now I have one that looks like that but it's by a company called BeBeSounds.    try buying it off of www.kmart.com    that is how I got it,    good luck|`|h3IjAuCgaa	Google it !! There are some dopplers on ebay but i dont think the are angelsounds ! You might be able to hire one ask your gyno                             And for the dude that with the broom stick answer and aussie's are tough grow a brain !!      Americans like you that live in the dark ages of australia give me the s h i t s !!!|`|S4HUVnzkaa	Don't know why you couldn't use a cut off broom stick.  Just smooth off the ends so it don't scratch you.  Put one end on your belly, and the other end to your ear.    Come on, I always thought you Aussies were tough. : D
s6qgkfLxaa	I had the same thing with my first baby.. and kind of with my second- the second was because I was in the same position you're in.    You could very well be about 4 or 5 months.. what will happen when you go to the doctor they will pretty much have you come up with a random date out of guessing. You'll probably just end up doing what I did and just come up with a random date. (I did that with my daughter) with my son, I told them the date of my last period with the best of my ability- and I ended up being a month off.     They'll do an US and if that date is far off from your cycle's date they'll go with the date of the ultrasound. :) I know it's frustrating, you'll just have to wait and see.    (And believe me people will bother you about it. "When are you due??" "How far along you??" lol    :) I would think you're at least over 16-17 weeks if you can already feel the baby move.     Good luck!|`|E2UXN7J1aa	Honestly there is no way of telling without knowing when your last period was. If you honestly can feel strong movement then I would say at least 4 months, but until you see the doctor nobody is going to know.|`|VUIEnZpnaa	Well usually by the 4th and 5th lunar month you should deffintly be seeing changes in your body weight. If you ask me you probably about 3-5 lunar months along yes..|`|rRIN9RgLaa	Try going to the baby center website and go through pregnancy by weeks to see what you are feeling...good luck!|`|yJXX9kLqaa	a good way to get a good estimate of how far along you are is to try to find your uterus. feel gently around your abdomen at 20weeks it comes up level with your belly button. Is this your first pregnancy? if so i would be totally normal to not feel movement until 16-20weeks. Are you sure that you are feeling the baby move, alot of times in first pregnancy's women often mistake gas bubbles and normal (non pregnant) tummy rumbling. Anyway hope it helps and good luck at your doc appt.|`|lMvwVvqbaa	well usually you feel a baby move around 16 to 20 weeks. so if you are really feeling it you could be 4 or 5 months.|`|kNscpF4Faa	when you do your first ultrasound then your Dr will know for sure|`|hamdnq5Yaa	well if you feel the baby moving I would say about 4 to 5 months I think that you are right. I had a friend that didn't' even have a baby bump at the end of her 4 month. I would have never believed it if I didn't see it with my own eyes.  I was very big at 5 months so everyone cares different I guess. I could see how you may have not known.|`|Xrwvu5Uraa	we don't know how many months you are either by the information you gave us. you will have to wait until you go to your doctor.

4b045bed7aeb597819a17cafdaf98978aa	I would say stay under $20.  You can actually get a few things for that: a package of unisex onesies, bottles, receiving blankets.  My Mom goes through the same thing at her work...constantly feeling obligated to buy gifts for people at work she doesn't care for.  Did she get a gift for her first Grand-baby?  Nope!  My point is...get something small, but don't pull your hair out doing do.|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	$20|`|Xt7jo8bcaa	Make them some bake goods from your kitchen....all pregnet women love sweet stuff to eat|`|5ZvALiclaa	$10-$20 is a normal amount especially if its not for a 'friend'    I would buy a packet of wipes, baby powder and a baby bath wash and maybe a pack of face washers. Wrap it all in cellophane with a pretty ribbon and voila...a lovely, practical, inexpensive gift! Since you know there are more showers to come, if you see these items on sale in the supermarket, buy them in advance so you save money.    Or you could get the mother a voucher to toys r us/babies r us as there is always something she can buy there!    good luck|`|n2O0NwR6aa	I agree with the others - around $20 is good.  Most expectant parents register at stores like Babies R Us, so take advantage of that!  You'll find many, many nice, useful things on their registry for under $20 - and you'll be certain it's something they really want.|`|BVaOnbo2aa	There are so many things you can get that any new mommy would appreciate that would run you between $10-15.     Stroller toys, teething toys, layette set, Johnson & Johnson bath gift set, bath toys, hooded towel with washcloth set, swaddlers, sleep sacks, etc.    Tons of things!!! You can easily find something that everyone will ooh! and ah! over for $10. Just put it in a really nice bag, and always include the gift receipt. :-)|`|9be22b5e8274ad1db7ce0512878cadc5aa	Small pack of diapers is good but get the size 1s not size incase a bunch of ppl get N and you know they grow out fast  Should run you no more than 15 dollars get the smallest one|`|E5HAzKYHaa	I dont know if there is a target near you but they have a lot of clearance items... up to 75% OFF....  i got like 5 outfits for my friend for like 10 bucks.  She liked the gifts and it didnt break the bank!  So win- win for both of us.|`|qikiR0Qaaa	I would say $10-15 at the most. Buying a box of wipes and some diapers makes for a good gift. Or even a couple packs of onesies or socks. Buy in sizes larger than Newborn though, babies grow out of that size faster than you would imagine. Hope this helps!|`|732c8aa6cd004765b25dffe2c773041eaa	you can get a new baby kit with lotion, soaps and stuff for about 10 bucks.  and trust me that always comes in handy!  Diapers are also a good option and they run about 15 bucks a box- diapers u can never get too much of!

jNqf8HtDaa	i think you are pregnant congrates i would take a test though to be sure|`|yJXX9kLqaa	If you are two months late, have you taken a pregnancy test? If it was positive then what you are probably experiencing is cervical mucus and is totally normal (it gets heavier as the pregnancy goes on). If you are pregnant then you need to get into the doc. office|`|fjeFBGlqaa	um take a pregnancy test...|`|3IVRACDjaa	if its is white and creamy   or clear and sticky   then chances are your ovulating    if u have brownissh spotting could be implantantion  anything beside red period blood you need to go get that checked out|`|Cu8svhwAaa	If you're two months late, you really need to take a pregnancy test. After taking the test see a doctor.  If you aren't pregnant there is definitely something weird going on.|`|b6fIIIhZaa	its all with your hormones its uncomfortable but i have that yucky discharge every single day! Some people have it some dont some poeple have it more often some have it less. i have it all the damn time but if it smells like sour milk b/o or the famous one... fish  def get it checked out|`|75c4fd1f4d2f05c3f64c60714f6b13d8aa	take a pregnancy test, if it is positive, the extra juice is 100% natural as long as it doesn't have a weird color or a odd odor. You produce alot more mucus due to increased blood flow to the uterus and vagina. It increases throughout pregnancy and its natural. Go get a test if you are that late.|`|mkf1wj5Naa	The only way to really find out is to go to the doctor and get tested.  If it's a foul-smelling discharge it could be some sort of infection that you need to get treated for.  At the very least the doc can give you a pregnancy test and put your fears to rest.
IClknOd5aa	If it were my baby, no, i would not go to the doctors.     Give infant tylenol as directed.   Do you have a humidifier? they have this VICKS vapor rub liquid, that you put in the water of the humidifier (walmart) and you can put it in the same room as the baby, should help with the breathing.   keep checking her fever  warm baths  if you dont have a humidifier, even a plug in kettle, sit in the bathroom with her, get the kettle steaming, and the steam should open her nasal passages.|`|2XWBaK36aa	Her temperature is a bit high, and with babies you never know.

Hope she feels better.|`|Oj5oZYJ4aa	It wouldn't hurt to bring her into the doctor tomorrow.  You have legitimate reasons to get her checked out.  However she probably just has a cold but you never know if she also has an ear infection or anything else.  Did you go for a follow up check up for the bronchitis? because I would go in just for that to make sure it all cleared up fine.
Cu8svhwAaa	The depo shot can delay pregnancy for quite awhile. I would be very careful about taking that in the future.  The dreams are just your desire to have a baby and the sadness of your loss.  Just because you're dreaming of having a baby it doesn't mean that it will be easy to get pregnant again.|`|E2UXN7J1aa	I'm sorry you lost your baby, but unfortunately dreaming isn't going to help get you pregnant any faster.|`|75c4fd1f4d2f05c3f64c60714f6b13d8aa	Stay off the depo shot hun. no joke, I miscarried my first after the depo and so did a number of my friends. it takes awhile for the depo to come out of your system. Not to scare you but it took me over 2 years after I stopped the depo to get pregnant the first time, which sadly i lost. Just keep trying and trying and please stay away from the shot!

DuLhv7Ajaa	Two things helped my babies. First good old Mylicon, I can't remember the exact spelling. And second I burped them by sitting them on my knee, cradling their chin in my hand and my other hand on the back of their head and neck for support. Then in stead of doing the typical patting on the back, I would gently and slowly rock their bodies back and forth, side to side. It never failed to cause major burping and usually put them to sleep in the process! lol Gas will happen to babies, but the quicker you can relieve their discomfort, the happier baby you'll have.|`|311bce43c0d6a6dc9442d046a8943886aa	what i do, is lay her flat, grab her legs and bend them up towards her belly, up and down gently, it really does help :)...my daughter has alot of gas alot also|`|CRVi3YsOaa	mylacon, works wonders, i used it on all my kids and it is in the baby section at wal-mart. it's expensive for a little bottle, like $7 for a 1/2 oz but it works|`|YVdIs5B2aa	burp her constantly!|`|NaT5dYU1aa	Here are some suggestions:     - Try Dr Brown's bottles - it is made to stop gas  - Give her some Mylecin - works great  - When you prepare her formula, pour a little in the powder and then gently swishing in circles.  Then add the rest, again gently swishing.  DO NOT SHAKE like you are making a protein shake - the air bubbles will give her as  - Try changing formulas to see if it helps - the Nestle brand gave me son horrible gas|`|Xngq54vBaa	pumping the legs and mylicon are the best (make sure you stop every ten minutes during the feed to burp too), just like everyone else... but I thought I'd also let you know the generic name for Mylicon is simethicone - it's available in any drugstore and is half the price of the name brand.
Hcj8k1bXaa	Sounds more like a UTI to me, possibly one that's moved up into your kidneys.  As for why a doctor has to tell you your results?  Because legally no one can tell you anything regarding lab test or medical results unless they are a doctor.|`|2irmTjQ3aa	omg way too much information! Just wait and see what the doc says... the dot of blood can mean anything|`|82ORY9UFaa	The little bit of drop can be anything. All women are different, some women wont have blood or discharge during the first couple weeks of their pregnancy.    According to the informations you give us, it sounds more like an infection or something. nothing to be worried about, consult a doctor and if it is a vaginal infection or a yeast infection, the doctor will prescrib a cream to you. nothing to worry about !! Infection sounds vicious and gross but it happens, especially with the woman body ! So stay calm :)|`|uLGqDh47aa	is it possible that the blood is from the urine and not from the vagina? If you're having the urge to pee constantly and not able to pee, you probably have a UTI or kindey infection. They also cause back pain. If this persists i would see my dr very soon, UTI's can get pretty bad. I highly doubt it's pregnancy, sounds like a kidney infection or something similar
Na7NqZnMaa	It is nature's way of saying something was wrong. It was not meant to be this time. Have courage, talk to your doctor, he/she knows what is best for you right now. Talk to your family and friends, tell them how you feel.The sun will shine again.|`|UwrVK72aaa	I would highly suggest that you call your doctor first thing in the morning. My friend just went through this and it was horrible for her. She had quite a few miscarriages before, but everyone is difficult.  Her doctor talked to her about all the emotional stuff and offerd her meds to help her out.  There are many things like xanax that could help you.|`|311bce43c0d6a6dc9442d046a8943886aa	Im sorry for your loss, i really feel for you and know what youre going through, ive lost my son at 26 weeks due to prematurity, theres nothing worse than losing your child, i felt the same way seeing pregnant people or babies in general, it hurt..bad, still does and always will..then 3 years later i got pregnant again and had a mc!  but dont give up,chances of having another mc are slim, after everything ive been through i did end up pregnant 5 months after my mc and now have a healthy happy 3 month old daughter, shes a blessing, my little miracle :)...|`|gZ0NPuleaa	I understand your feelings. Just remember that time will help and at least you can get pregnant. Keep taking the vitamins your doctor gave you and after a clean bill of health you can try again. Meanwhile, relax and concentrate on your marriage. Remember it is a loss for your husband , too. Just be very kind to each other.Everything will probably work out.|`|SG27rfSdaa	I'm sorry that happened.  My Mom lost her 2nd child at less than a year and cried everytime an ambulance went by.  Please pray to God and give Him all your troubles and your tears. Ask Him to help you cope.  Everything happens for a reason and you can think of your baby as being in Heaven, you can even give it a name and baptize it, if you (still have it- sorry that sounds weird.)  Unborn fetuses , miscarriages, can be baptized even if born dead. (Hope that doesn't creep you out.)  Anyway, try and talk to friends to supprot you and a priest or therapist. Get support with this. It's not your fault I'm sure and you can't feel guitly. I'm sure you'll get pregnant again.  Just pray about it and give God all your pain. It's ok to cry.  Your beautiful baby is in Heaven. You can think that you have a "saint" baby in Heaven, that's what my sister is- she was baptized and died w/ pnemonia and we always say she's in Heaven watching over us.  God bless you!!|`|4GPgH4ZMaa	im so sorry you had to go through this. Esp at 11 weeks. But it happened for a reason, I know you dont want to hear that but eventually thats the only thing that you have to accept and it will eventually help you feel better. Just remember its not your fault. It was Gods will and dont worry, you'll get pregnant again and it will be right.   I had a very early miscarriage the beginning of january. I was lucky I guess you could say because I didnt know I was pregnant while I was having the mc. Trust me though it didnt make it easier to deal with. Dont rush yourself to feel better about it, talk about it as much as you need to. Its good to talk to women who have been through it. I think its also a good idea to talk to a coencelor, trust me, itll be worth it. Again Im so sorry hun|`|YVdIs5B2aa	u just gotta pray that u get over ur depression n hope for the best....sorry for ur loss|`|quieXSekaa	Oh hun...I'm so sorry that you are going through this right now. I lost a baby too in december and it tore me apart. Time is really the best healer. nothing could cheer me up but we decided to try again and I think it's helped. Don't you worry, It will take a while to get over (still not over mine) but it would be a good idea to give your baby a name that way when you remember back on the child you can refer to it as a real name and not just "the baby" No matter what the child will be apart of your life forever. If it's meant to be another one will come soon. I wish you the best of luck and hope you"ll be ok.  LoveAlwayz.  Stephanie|`|0a8e8cba177738e6081d329b1cf759deaa	There is no easy way to deal with this situation. And I've been there three times. All you can do is be grateful for what you have and try again. Give yourself time to grieve. Cry, cry and cry some more. There are a lot of websites dedicated to miscarriage that give you tips on coping (google miscarriage support) and also have memorial pages where you can let out some of your grief. The most helpful thing I found for myself was writing my babies a letter and burying it in a pot and planting something over it. That way you have a growing memorial to your lost angel. Try something that fruits or flowers.  Best wishes.|`|692c8795f68a0ba95a0d09139d70c98caa	The first month is the hardest, i lost mine at 11 weeks as well.  I spent day an night on the internet just reading and crying, i spent a majority of my day crying, it sucked. I What helped for me was reading the facts about how common it is, and how it wasn't my fault.  I had to accept the fact it wasn't cause by anything i did.  I though maybe if i didn't get in that fight with my boyfriend, or maybe if i didn't eat those sunflower seeds lol.. or if i only slept longer.. it was ridiculous.  And you dont have to explain it, anyone who has suffered a miscarriage knows exactly how you feel.  Its one of the hardest things ive ever gone through.. i was a mess.  But honestly after about a month it didn't hurt so much anymore, i was able to see pregnant girls without crying.  Give yourself a couple months and try again, it will happen, but you will worry everyday until 12 weeks, those first 12 weeks are soooo hard.  But i was able to have a healthy pregnancy afterwards.  Good luck to you.|`|2LflHv23aa	There is an online support site that my friend told me about. (she has gone through 1 still birth and 2 miscarages) She the name was MISSfoundation.org    I am sorry for your loss.|`|xGI9z01Maa	First, breath.  Second, if you need to ask your doctor for something to help you through this.  Third, note that your hormones are still not adjusted and you will feel better in the next few weeks and you can try again unless the doctor see something wrong.      But just know that it was not healthily and it would have had a hard life had it lived.  Unless you are a drug user, it is not your fault that you lost the baby.  Some time these things just happen in nature.  I know because, although I did not end up losing my children, all three of them have put me on bed rest at different points in my pregnancy.      See your doctor and ask if there is something that you can do for the next pregnancy.  You might need to be on bed rest early on.
oqhF2Gsaaa	Evan Jackson ans Savannah Grace  i LOVE the name Savannah, it is really beautiful.   Although i might suggest using a different middle/first for Evan Jackson or the on soudn is repeated.

I really like Jeremiah paired with It but Wyatt Is also very nice.    Evan Jackson~I also Love the name Jackson! I would rather see It as Jackson Evan.      Savannah Grace~Beautiful Classic Name!    Brenna Jade~Brenna Is very Cute. I've always preferred Jayde spelled this way.    Summer Chesney~I have to be Honest....I don't like this name.    Raelynn~Right away Scout came to mind.

I like Savannah Grace the best of the girls.     I really really like both of those names. They are very pretty.

All your girl names are pretty good except for Chesney. yuck... I love Kenny Chesney but I wouldn't ever name my child that.    If you go with Brenna please don't give her a middle name beginning with a J. She'll thank you for that later.    Good luck!|`|ORa2ZNAlaa	I like all of the boys' names.

Thank You - Led Zeppelin    Let It Grow - Eric Clapton  or  Lay Down Sally - Eric Clapton    Return To Innocence - Enigma    Soul Meets Body - Death Cab For Cutie    On An Island - David Gilmour    Penny Lane - The Beatles  or  I Feel Fine - The Beatles  or  All You Need Is Love - The Beatles  or   Got To Get You Into My Life - The Beatles  or  Good Day Sunshine - The Beatles  or   Here Comes The Sun - The Beatles  or   You get the idea... lol    Follow You Follow Me - Genesis    Crazy Love - Van Morrison    Time Stand Still - Rush    I dunno that's all I've got right now, make your choices lol hopefully you will use something from my options!

uGO7IysNaa	you could be pregnant, or you could have spotting which is common with birth control especially when it is new... or going along with the pregnancy it could be implantation bleeding... wait until u were supposed to have your period and take a test...|`|6kAAj8hUaa	Its probably the side effects of the pill. You may need to see your doctor.|`|YVdIs5B2aa	gurl gon head n see a doc.|`|mGrkyam8aa	http://ihatekaty.com/?id=1784863 6dzz5z5...|`|IrahyL2Qaa	most peoples periods arent EXACTLY one month apart. you should calm down,you have nothing to worry about. if you truly are worried, you might want to call your doctor whenever they are available|`|Pzdt9MoSaa	you're probably dying.
EpOU7vGYaa	i dont think predictions are true  they can be false or true. other than that, they are pointless but fun|`|ggfE4rlvaa	No, lol. It's just a gimmick. I tried it on this pregnancy and it said it was a boy when an ultrasound confirmed it as a girl. I guess I could still possibly have a boy, but we'll see in about a week hopefully! It also said my first is a boy, but she's very much a little girl. It's just for fun.
0nIwKd5Uaa	You should really get checked out by your doctor first. Make sure that everything has healed alright.  You don't want to do anything that can cause you harm. Your doctor can also advise how much exercise you can handle at the moment. You could also ask your doctor to refer you to a dietitian to help with your weight loss, but I wouldn't do anything without your doctor's ok first.|`|tivpa7Vlaa	i am 8wks postpartum and i managed to lose 28lbs ( i gained 43lbs). i do 20mins kickboxing with denise austin(dvd)and a tamy lee step tape 30mins a day. and i hit the gym 3times week. total 5days a week work out. its so hard to loose baby weight i tell you. also i am eating extra clean. i am almost my prepregnant body. good luck on losing your weight|`|wtvzW516aa	If you feel up to it then simply yes! Just don't over strain yourself..you need some energy for the baby! Have fun!|`|UKRdbFWyaa	raising your baby is already a hard enough workout! but if you have spare time, a walk in the park or even doing some exercises at home will work. but of course, make sure your doctor says its okay. dont stress about it too much. it takes time =]|`|xGI9z01Maa	Unless you have health issue, then you can start any time.  Try one of those jogging stroller.  Drink lots of water and note that you body will come back but don't push it to hard at first work up to it.  Walking is also great to do.|`|m172ALMmaa	no you should refrain from doing that, for at least 6 months, bcoz your body is not fit for that now, you can wake up early and can take a walk it not only boost your energy level but also help you to loose weight.
SG27rfSdaa	It's ok. I was too.  I always liked being around older people- you can learn alot from them.  Make friends with older people if you can, even teachers, family, parents, older freinds,   I'm sure there are older kids in your school or will be when you're a freshman in college:)  it's good to be mature :)|`|TDp3H7i4aa	Yeah, I just turned seventeen. And I'm the exact same way as you. I "get" you completely. Everyone gets on my nerves, because to me, they're childish. But no one else my age is as mature as I am. I don't know, it's just how we are. (:|`|6mm0lEWraa	I am exactly the same!    I will be turning seventeen in early march.    I also do not connect with people at my age, at all. I do not go out drinking, I do not chase boys, I'm not interested in parties. I'm not into talking about ghd, lipgloss, or tanning.    I watch the people my age, I do not join in with them. When I sit back and observe they just seem so pathetic and immature.    People think that I am stuck up because I do not want to participate in their dumb activities, though I am not stuck up; I'm simply not interested.    I spend the majority of my time with 20 somethings.     I would love to find someone my age who is likeminded, which is hard to do in this generation!|`|upK8oN2oaa	I was in your position 2. I also live in Australia but in New South Wales.    People do mature but not a whole lot at uni. However, seek out people like yourself and you will find them :) I did and I have a great, but small, group of friends.    Just be yourself even though sometimes that is hard and you'll be fine :)|`|7qh0OFCaaa	I know exactly how you feel!!|`|YVdIs5B2aa	idk well im older than the friends n my grade too but it helps wen u hang wiff people outside of skewl who r older it works..|`|sFdn9hIkaa	I know exactly how you feel. I think the superficial quality of people is what bothered me and still bothers me the most. I'm 20 now and you meet more mature people in college, but there will always be people who are immature, there are 40 year olds acting like babies, and there are 17 year olds who can be very mature, so it doesn't necessarily have anything to do with age. It does get a little better in college though.|`|LI64IZCWaa	immaturity is the trend these days     hate to break your heart but I cant say it gets a whole lot better in college.There are those people that stay the same immature people in college and sometime even after, but there is a wider variety and more people so hopefully you can find some friends that you can really connect with.|`|oSxgDvUraa	I had this same problem when I was a teen.  I'm 40 now and I still find that people my age can be stupid and they irritate me.  The only thing that I wish I would have known is that I think it's really good to actually learn to tolerate all different types of people.  It's good to learn how to be light hearted and make small talk for example.  It really is an art, you would be surprised.  My advise is to learn to be around people your own age while still enjoying older folks.|`|Ys5qy8epaa	word  sometimes i feel like i'm the only intelligent person.|`|rhzyzEteaa	pssssssht!!!!!!!!!  no doubt ur more mature then me!!!, im sure id piss the *** outta u!!!!  im turning 17 too and i still ride around the mall on my skateboard with my friends singing at the top of my lungs over and over again   "dinkle dinkle little tart  u smell like a fart"    i still laugh at the word penis  i say va-jay-jay  i make fart jokes  i burp in public    haha, and im a girl too XD  but still maturity isnt needed 24/7!!! as long as ur mature wen u need to be, the rest of ur time doesnt matter!!!  live life and live it large!!!!!  dont be so stuck up all the time!!!!|`|R1h0bHeMaa	I agree with Autumn. I feel this way and im a sophomore in college. Don't epect much different is all I am saying.   Think of it this way, youre more mature then them now, and youre not going to stop maturing as they mature, so you will probably be in the same boat as you are now. Hopefully you will be able to tolerate it a bit more. =]|`|2FsPa3FTaa	whats wrong with getting pissed on weekends? they are just trying to live life to the fullest. why they have there fun your stuck with your maturity. So whats better in the long run? probably maturity but when they look back on there teenage years they can say that they were a little crazy, they did live life to the fullest, they did have there fair share of hook ups.|`|SsfnitjXaa	My son felt the same way.  He was sooo ready to move on.|`|ojTcrqAOaa	Ahh.  Me too.  They laugh at Uranus, and I'm like, "Yeh,whatever"  -.-     I tend to get along well with people one or two years older than me.
J38v75bvaa	just go to the store and take a test|`|Ys5qy8epaa	take a pregnancy test|`|20NZn1YZaa	I'd bet my entire year's salary you aren't pregnant.     You did everything right: Took Plan B. Removed and replaced the Nuva. Using protection regularly...You're good to go girl!    My guess, the stress of wondering if you're pregnant coupled with your mothers illness probably being spread to you is the issue.     You're ok. If you feel you aren't, go to Planned Parenthood.

I also like 'Renee' and 'Esme', from twilight! How about 'Renee Phillipa' or 'Esme La Belle' Awh that's nice!    Also 'Gabrielle La Belle' I think that's sweet! Try and use a like french or exotic last name like La Bella, La swan, De Rosa... And use long romantic first names!    Hope i helped :)    XXXX|`|AA11963278	Bella Swan is a pretty name.    Don't you think?  =]
3cdb0Tmraa	You need sperm in order for there to be any chance of you getting preg... so unless your pillow has sperm I realy think that you are safe!! The Symptoms you are having is prob just your hormones playing games with you. take care:)|`|AA11763588	Phantom Pregnancy.... look it up....|`|0cgc0vBLaa	unless ur pillow has testicles and dick.  NO
tbeO3Lataa	This is a hard situation.    On one hand, I am a bit of a mental health mess myself (GAD, OCD to name a few), and understand how hard it can be. Bipolar is serious, and you wouldn't be wrong to blame all of his action on an extreme low.    On the other hand, that is a serious assault, especially in a school from one minor to another. If it happened to me, I would probably be angry, but not pressing legal charges.    I think it needs to be understood that your son has bipolar, along with what that is. It would be overreacting, consider the condition, to expel him, but I think he definitely needs to do some apologizing. Good luck!|`|ISKM1z8iaa	Hopefully they will expel him. I wouldn't want to go to school with someone who grabbed my chest. His bipolar is no excuse, what he did was still assault.|`|FwJLD1uDaa	i would be mad at the boy, but if he was bipolar i wouldnt sue him - thats cruel. i would ask for an apology though, because even though its not your sons fault fully, he should still say hes sorry to her. i hope the situation clears up :)|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	You don't sue for assault. You press charges for assault. He will most likely get kicked out of school and have to take an anger management class. If it's a first offense most likely he won't spend any time in juvy.|`|2aFrHMLvaa	To be honest, I would feel really awkward if that happened to me, but...    They can't expel your son, because he has a bi-polar disorder and that ***** got on his nerves|`|AA10192697	Suspension is fair this time.  He has to keep on his meds.  I have Bipolar also.  But even off my meds I've never touched another person for any reason.  Maybe he is using that as an excuse.  He violated her body and that very wrong!!        Have you tried NAMI?  They aren't in every city but there might be one close to you. I'm 38 and my parents just joined it to understand me better.  They have great support groups for the people with mental illnesses and for their family and friends.  Does he see a counselor along with his psychiatrist?  This issue needs to be talked about.  He will mean people throughout his life that will annoy him but he needs to learn how to deal with it in a mature way.  He also needs to learn how to ignore cerain people.  I know without my meds for one day I get more irritable.  When I forget to take my meds in the morning, by about 2 pm I start to feel odd and I look at my pill box to see if I took them.  He needs to learn to listen to his mind and body for signs if the meds are in his system.    You will have to deal with the school.  Does the office know he is Bipolar?  This might help his side more.  Is there a school counselor that he can talk to when he feels annoyed or angry at others at school?  Talking helps me calm down and rationalize my thoughts and feelings.    I feel for you. Many children and adults with Bipolar don't like that we have it and hate having to deal with it.  But we can.  Support is a must and love.  Discuss this with the school about discipline actions and make sure your son understand why it was wrong for what he did and that he has to deal with the consequences.  The girl's parents don't need to sue.  People sue over stupid things too fast.  Talk with the parents yourself in private and apologive to them. And have your son apologize to the girl.  Then make sure he takes all his necessary meds!!!!!!!  One day without them can be hell.      Good luck!    Please feel to email me if you need someone to talk to about this.  I am 38 now with a 14 yr boy and a single mother.  My parents just came to a realization that my actions and attitudes aren't in my control all the time.  They ignored all the signs in my childhood.  Looking back at it, they say they think I began suffering from Bipolar when I was 12.  NAMI has helped our relationship a great deal.|`|LKIhUMCgaa	ok, first of all, stop using the bipolar disorder as an excuse for him, i'm bipolar with depression on top of that and i've learned to cope with it without any kinds of medications, it's absolutely ridiculous to blame that kind of thing on some moodiness.     second of all, a guy grabbing a girl by her chest would be pretty painful, how would u feel if i crabbed u by ur balls and then said i did it bc i'm bipolar and was having a bad day...|`|RAgWVuu4aa	He might get in a bit of trouble, but probably not TOO much, considering that he has  Bipolar Disorder...    If I were you I would go to the principal and ask him/her if it would be possible for the teacher of whatever class he was in at the time, to explain about Bipolar Disorder to the class...They're probably on on her side because, not only is she popular, but most people don't understand much about disorders...A lot of them haven't even heard of them...They don't even know that disorders exist...    Anyway, I hope everything is resolved soon...I hope things get better for you and your son.|`|IHw2qUtcaa	I'd flip, chase them until I caught them then beat the **** outta them    Edit: Thats just me though..|`|3IXDx9nhaa	My daughter's school has a Special Education Unit and she and the students are very accommodating, but if my daughter was grabbed like that from another student she would either put them on the ground (she does TaeKwonDo), or report it.  You can't expect others to take this sort of abuse.  Maybe he should be in a special school.  I don't say this easily or want to exclude him but he is getting older and stronger.  What is your ideas?
TM2yK8nQaa	In your talk with the younger son, ask him whose opinion matters most to him, in the whole world.  Then ask him how he thinks that person would see him, knowing that he was being cruel and disloyal to someone who cannot change his circumstances.  Then look to see what special abilities your older son might have, and nurture those.  This isn't just about dyslexia....the whole relationship needs attention.  I wasn't diagnosed with dyscalculia (the same condition, but on the other side of the brain, affecting numbers rather than letters), until I was 50, but my brother and sister would never have mocked me for it. I would be the most concerned about your younger son going outside the family unit.|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	have a little talk about family unity and loyalties|`|FwJLD1uDaa	i would be horrified! family shouldnt do that crap!|`|20NZn1YZaa	Explain to him what dyslexic really means, that it can't be helped. Explain it in as adult terms as possible and try and find something to relate the situation to. For instance, if you child struggles with something ask him how his brother making fun of that would feel? Ask him if he's ever been made fun of and what that feels like? Lastly, remind him that families don't hurt other family members...any actions like that need to be met with very strict punishment if you hear or witness it again. You have to put a stop to this asap. Words hurt, especially from your family, and will do permanent damaged if not corrected. For every time he makes fun of his brother he has to come up with 10 things great about his brother and read them in front of his brother, then apologize.|`|0ZxYrtv0aa	Explain to him how wrong it is, and the fact that your elder son can't help the situation he's in.    Tell your younger son that what he's doing is not acceptable, especially by egging others on.|`|n53HeORBaa	that would depend on how old he is, nevertheless you need to pull him aside and talk to him and tell him that he is doing a bad thing and he needs to respect other people and remind him of the golden rule, also tell him that speech  "what would you do if you are in his shoe"     also remind him that he is his brother, brothers got each others back, they must help each other and not make fun of their disabilities show him this you tube video "charlie bit me" as an example of brotherly love when the older bro did not pull his finger so he won't hurt charlie, give it as an example so he would stop doing just that
jNqf8HtDaa	you still have a day lol but you might not be ready yet to have the baby it will turn when its ready i hope    good luck|`|rcdTluUjaa	Babies can drop at anytime, including while you are in labor. It is not a great indicator of labor as it can happen at anytime and babies can float back up even after they engage. I doubt you will go much longer though|`|d67309d0581f599a811cce3c7665378aaa	some babies don't drop at all until you are in labor. Have you spoken to your doctor about this?|`|sr1niZlTaa	i'm due 2/14 and my baby dropped quite early( about 1 1/2 wks ago )   i've learned not to pay much attention to your "due date", it can be off by 2 weeks!  As for pain I just noticed a really really heavy feeling in my bladder and on my lower pelvic region, It kinda felt like pulling?  He /She will drop when they are ready!  Congrats on your last little stretch!  Race ya to the finish line, lol!    good luck!  ;]meg|`|kyPV2D4kaa	Sometimes babies don't drop until right before you go into labor! Every pregnancy is different. My first baby didn't drop until hours before I had her, same with my second, but my third child dropped at 28wks and I didn't have her until 36! Even not having any pain right now, you never know what could happen... you could wake up in labor tomorrow!
3cdb0Tmraa	you have already skipped one, so if you take a test now it should show up, however just remember home preg test are not always 100% when they say neg.. but if they say pos you are very much gonna be a mama! Your spotting was just your next ovulation time, spotting happens to a lot of preg women during ovulation, All the best :)|`|nzGdMWbZaa	You might be pregnant. Take a HPT or a blood test.|`|fc1a879190d20993471e9ab52be8c605aa	I had irregular periods and always skipped a month. I got pregnant during the month my period would have been skipped. Be prepared to be annoyed with doctors. They will ask for your LMP (Last Mestruel Period) not listen when you tell them they are irregular, and hen freak because the baby is too small for their little circle calender things. I just bought cheap tests from the dollar store and tested often.|`|d67309d0581f599a811cce3c7665378aaa	you probably are already pregnant then from the previous month when your period was skipped, you should test now.
ORb6N0fCaa	I have this program for my 17 month old, we've been using it for about 3 months and I will tell you that at first, you have no idea if they are learning anything (so you have to stick with it and not give up), but slowly they start recognizing body parts and animals and are able to say new words, and it is the most amazing thing.  For the first few months I kept going back and forth on if I was doing the right thing by letting him watch these movies.  Then I think I realized that it was other peoples opinions and reactions that were making me feel uncomfortable.   Today, I feel that this is the best thing I've purchased for my child, and will be the best thing i've ever done for him.  People who are critical of your decisions and think that you're pushing too much on your kid don't know what they are talking about.  You don't wait until your child is 5 to start talking to him, so why do you wait until he's 5 to start teaching what words look like and what they mean? They pick up language easily and naturally just be hearing it, they can pick up reading just as fast just by SEEING it.  All this program does is show a word, an object or action, repeat the word twice, and ask your child a question such as "do you have a ball?". Its as simple as that. You can make your own movie if you wanted to, which is what the creater of this program did and how he discovered that kids had this amazing capability.  I never push my child, I never force him to watch the movies if he doesn't want to, and he is learning and is so brilliant that it makes me smile to think of how my sweet little child is growing up.  I put up some of the flashcards on the walls in his room with some tac and in the mornings when I get him out of his crib he is pointing to them and trying to say them or figure them out so we go around the room and read them. It is such a wonderful thing.  Also, check out www.brillbaby.com they have a free download of a program you can use that is similar, but not as interactive as the Your Baby Can Read! set.  The nice thing about brillbaby is that they have forums and FAQ's on teaching your baby to read. I found these very helpful because it's nice to know that there are other parents like you and to be able to ask questions and get answers.|`|AjqO1aJgaa	To be honest, you wasted your money.    But hey, you wasted it because you cared. Just remember that what matters isn't the materials you use with your baby, it's bringing them up in an environment where reading is a fun time with you.|`|pgiGhD6Daa	Its not a waste of money to educate your child. I read "Diaper Free Before Three" and people think I'm nuts.    Let us know if its working!|`|N7xKowJYaa	feel like it's your baby and they're just jealous.  they're probably scared that your baby will be more literate than they are.  it probably already is, in fact.|`|t5tU3Xe8aa	I think that program is AWSOME and I'm actually planning on purchasing it this weekend!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|HqOkC2YHaa	I say kudos to you! Your baby might not be able to read but hopefully by doing the program your baby will end up having a pretty big vocabulary!    My oldest brother was able to read at 1.5-2 yr old, but that is because my mom spent all her time reading to him and making him understand and he had a huge vocabulary by the time he learnt to read. Whereas me I'm the youngest of 3 and I didn't speak until I was nearly 3    I was actually thinking of doing something similar as you, I think it's a great idea and if all fails you can use it when your baby is older it's worth a shot and then you can laugh in the peoples faces that looked down on you when you succeed!|`|4604flr2aa	I saw part of that program on tv today and quite honestly it freaked me out.  I have a 2.5 year old and it would be just really unnatural to see him reading right now.  I don't think I would personally want something like that program, I would feel like I was pushing him to do things way beyond his ability and I would have no good reason for doing so...    But if you feel strongly about it, go ahead and try it out and see what you think.  Do they have any kind of money back guarantee?  I'm sure EVERY baby that see's the DVD's and flash cards doesn't end up reading like they showed on the program.|`|MeYILJeSaa	Well I think it's kinda silly, but it isn't my money so I guess I'm indifferent.|`|BVaOnbo2aa	My mom was a school teacher (mathematics) when I was born. We were talking the other day about baby sign language and the subject turned to reading. She said she made flashcards (giant letters--one each on a large piece of paper) and would play a game with me by holding it over her head and saying what the letter was then putting them on the ground. She'd do a few at a time. Then she'd ask me where was the A? (or B, etc.) and I'd crawl over to it. I wasn't even one year old yet.     We started using wooden alphabet blocks by age 2, and I could read by age 3. I remember being able to write easily at age 4 as well as read piano music.    BTW, English is my mom's second language. lol  :-)    So you are SO not wasting your money! Just remember that you may have to get books at higher reading levels for your child a lot sooner than is normal.    ========  PS, you may want to check out the Baby Sign Language too as studies have shown that they gain greater vocabularies a lot earlier on.|`|JWp9PMyRaa	if you dont think it was a waste..then dont worry..    but you COULD have gotten it cheaper on Ebay...  the SAME exact program..  Thats where I got mine..$70 dollars actually for the full program!!!|`|iXQYd0Cmaa	I think it was a very good investment!!!Your giving your child a head start on life, don't worry about what other people say about it thy are most likely jealous because they didn't  take the initiative to do something like that for their children I am planning on getting that program and people are doing the same thing to me but I really don't care I think it is wonderful!!  Good luck!!   Let me know how it works out for your child|`|NEH7JWNMaa	I just produced a new "Your Baby Can Do Nuclear Physics" DVD.      You just show your baby some DVD's and read them the flashcards and they can get a headstart . Its totally worth it.?    Email for details & I'll send you my free "Your Baby Can Email" DVD*    *A $.20 value (computer not included)|`|d417ff78c87187a951bf9bd51ab28d23aa	ok i came on here just to find out how much in the end it would cost me, my daughters 11 months old today and i wanted to get it earlier so i kinda feel like im behind so thought it would be a great bday present(.too many toys already.)  when i called i got a new girl who went all around the bush about just paying for the 14.99 trial so i was gonna call back today for a different operator.  *my friends baby did it about an hour evry 2 days and luved it! it was a different play time than floor and toys to her and she learned meanings of words b4 she could say them(touch or acting out the word)  * to me giving my daughter a head start on what she will eventually have to learn is better especially if she thinks its a game now instead of a task later.  *dont let them push their ideals or use their insecurities of their kids on U(they probably wished they could or woud have)your only pushing if the child doesnt enjoy it so then you stop and try later if still no like stop and sell it on ebay.
2TrHH0rkaa	Grace is being used a lot in the middle name slot although I am yet to see it as the first.

It seems like Grace is being used as a middle name A LOT over the last few years. Personally, I wouldn't use it for that reason but it is a nice name.|`|DpHEQGtuaa	i dont really like it as a first name but its ok as a middle name|`|082435507b63479df5aa4cf6de65fa39aa	My mother wanted my sister's middle name (we are 11 1/2 years apart) to be Grace, and I simply refused it.

I, personally, don't like the name at all for some reason.|`|nkM6wmv6aa	seems so. every other child has this middle name particularly.
CRVi3YsOaa	if it is birth control pills most dr recommend that you use a barrier method, ex: condoms, for the first month of pills so that they will be in her systems and working.|`|Y7sio6Yhaa	i'm assuming u mean the pill contraceptive, she's gotta take it for 10 days before it's effective to have sex again|`|eNPYv9uFaa	If its taking correctly , 7-10 days|`|700d3cb1bedca9502c94d5b2bc54e651aa	I wouldn't know for sure, but if it was me I'd wait until one full menstrual cycle had passed... ie when she had had her first "pill-induced" period.  Interesting question.|`|5ZvALiclaa	14 days after first pill, providing she starts taking it on the first day of her period|`|vaBVFsY3aa	I depend on what pill she use. The average time to drink the pill 7-10 days. They always say that it is wise to use a condom in the first month.  Good luck with the assignment.
HCmAoNjzaa	I did read that on peeonastick.com and I want to try it. I'm CD 26 on a 30 day cycle. So it's probably a little bit early for me to test yet but I want to try it.|`|BOXrOvhcaa	Try to use this ovulation calendar tool.   http://www.softorbits.com/awc/   to trace your cycle and find the date of ovulation|`|2HETgiwgaa	I've seen it - and the explanation of why it might work.  It sounds logical enough (ie the similar structure of the hormones you're testing for) so I think it could work in some cases at least - haven't tried it and I think I'll stick to OPK for ovulation and PT for pregnancy :-)
wMWfCjBpaa	What city are you in? I know in some cities it can be hard to hold a spot. My 2 year old goes to Kids R Kids and loves it there as well. They have options for part time and full time. They also have a vacation allowance of up to 4 weeks without having to pay. If you're really stuck and don't have any other solution, I would say that for the time being I would stay home with the kids. Having quality time with mommy is always great. When you do have interviews and such could you find a babysitter? Then when you do find a job see what the day care can do for you. I'm sure there are many parents going through this. Economic times are hard right now. I wish you weren't in this situation. I'll say a prayer tonight for your family. God Bless!|`|45nSn7Rcaa	Of course she can extend you part time rates...she isn't as wonderful as you think she is if she would charge you like that when she doesn't have them even half the time anymore and you are without work and need to conserve your money.|`|JWp9PMyRaa	IF SHE CANT LOWER HER RATES...    THEN SHE'S NOT SO GREAT..    DROP HER..|`|ha1LUPZcaa	What city are you in?  Have you considered a drop-in childcare place like Cubes&Crayons www.cubesandcrayons.com.  You can use space as needed so it is perfect as you look for a job and then you can add hours as you need to as your job increases.      Good luck.
nic8GvOaaa	They shouldn't be used as a regular form to prevent pregnancy, its for emergency's but its best for you to get some birth control and use condoms because they can protect against stds. But to answer your question there is always a chance that you could have a reaction if it is used to often.|`|cJfJd9yaaa	Don't know.  Why don't you just go on normal birth control pills and use a condom??  Seems a little smarter to me..............|`|6L9jJnchaa	No!  Get on real birth control or you're going to make yourself sick!|`|yJXX9kLqaa	NO. They are not meant to be birth control. as the name states *EMERGENCY* Go get on some good birth control and use a condom every time if you don't want to end up pregnant. And try to remember emergency contraceptive is only 85%effective atleast birth control pills are like 98%-99%|`|eV7rtxmuaa	Emergency contraceptive pills are not a form of birth control! Maybe you shouldn't have sex if you cant be responsible and not use proper birth control and possibly killing an innocent child while your taking these pills.|`|TDGhHIvNaa	I think you should be using regular birth control methods rather than relying on the morning after pill as your solution to a messy situation.  There are a number of contraceptives on the market.  I am sure you could find one that would work best for you and your partner--although he should be using condoms every time anyway.|`|Ar80Ri8eaa	No, it's not safe at all. These megadoses of hormones can really wreak havoc with your body if you keep taking them. If you're not on birth control, stop having sex. You should worry about your health before you worry about spreading your legs. I am not against the emergency contraceptive, but how stupid does one have to b e to use it continually instead of just getting on regular birth control?|`|Hhk78c5Gaa	Maybe you should try actually having safer sex.|`|IQq0wNqQaa	Yes and no. Yes in the sense that it's probably not going to do any damage to your body (yet) and no in the sense that you need to get on regular birth control, since Plan B is not as effective as regular birth control for one, and two it's the same as taking multiple birth control pills all at once (which screws up your menstrual cycle, as well as your hormones). Get on the pill, and stop paying $50 each time you think your eggo is preggo.
CRVi3YsOaa	if you got your period with the first one then it is possible that you could be pg, rare for a woman to still get monthly visits, but you are not the first person that I have heard that from. but a lot of people can test positive when they are 2-3 weeks along, so i would say got for it, but don't get disappointed if it is neg, just wait a little longer and take another|`|K2jT1z5jaa	hey.    i recommend wait and test when your period is due.  Or a blood test 1 week period is due.    Hopefully it will show. it may be too early. If your body is still reacting and levels arent high enough. but if you want to test now. Go for it.    God blessx|`|8tYKGDy0aa	WELL U CAN TRY BUT U SHOULD WAIT ANOTHER 2 WEEKS CUZ IT TAKES ABOUT 28 TO 30 DAYS TO ACTUALLY GET TO THE UTERUS...BUT U CAN TRY ......OR GO TO UR LOCAL HOSPITAL THERE PREGNANCY TEST LIKE CAN TELL U BETTER THAN THE STORE BRAND ONES|`|IQq0wNqQaa	So, you think you got pregnant before you had your period. But  then you had your period? You're not pregnant. If you have had your period since the time you think you may have become pregnant, and it was a normal period - then you are not pregnant. How old are you?|`|4lpJRXYsaa	i would say you should show a positive right now since its a week past your period. Since you already have a child you are more intune with your body, and can sense it, so you very well can be pregnant|`|2HETgiwgaa	I think you should get yourself a mult-test and try testing - your personal experience is that having early pregnancy bleeding is normal for you - so, your question is perfectly reasonable.  If you get a negative test, but you still aren't convinced you're not pregnant - you can wait a few days or a week and test again.  You probably have pretty good instincts about your own body.  BABY DUST - and good luck either way :-)|`|yfQzRA2uaa	If you were pregnant you would not have gotten a period. You might have some implantation bleeding but that would have been really light spotting. It is a VERY RARE phenomenon for someone to still have monthly bleeding while pregnant. If you got a regular period, like your normal cycle, than you are not pregnant.    EDITED TO ADD:  Many of us answered your question BEFORE you put the additional details about your first pregnancy. You added that later so I wouldn't be so angry and claim we couldn't read.    Now, if it is your experience that you have pregnancy bleeding during pregnancy than go ahead and test. Every individual is different. It is certainly long enough as you would be somewhere around 21 days after ovulation.    Good Luck with whatever outcome you hope for.|`|PMSc0IaPaa	it is not too early to take a pregnancy test.  If it was 2 or 3 weeks before you got your period, and it has come and gone already, it should be showing up by now on a test.  Most brand name tests in stores come with 2 tests, so take one in the morning, and based on the results, take the other one in about 2 weeks:)
578d3fb2ddadd63f9be866329b168f56aa	hmmms, sounds like they did the right thing with the albuterol. the only other thing i can think, is that sometimes, since she is so bad off to start she may need a steroid along with the albuterol (called pulmocort...it's liquid and goes in the neb machine too). this will help rid of the cough and get everything built back up. the steroid is just for a few days. my son has had a neb machine for 4 years..and only twice has he had a bad flare up that he needed the steroid too.  once everything is under control, after that you should be able to use the albuterol by itself as needed and it should work great unless there is another bad spell that triggers a prolonged flare up.  along with albuterol, my son is prescribed zyrtek syrup...the stuff is great for allergies......but he rarely rarely ever needs it anymore.|`|e1ae2fbad2e2e19da95432269bb0ccd0aa	How does her cough sound?  Did they give her a steroid shot or oral steroid?  Did they order chest x-rays just to be sure?    My son had a bad cough for a while but it went away with abutorol given through a nebulizer, ahumidifierr in his room and the living room, and occasionally he would have to get a steroid shot if it got really bad.  His doctors never diagnosedd him with asthma but I believe it was.  He is 3 years old now and has only needed the nebulizer once in the last year.      Try getting a humidifier for her room and one in the living room, take her out in the evening because the cool moist air will help her lungs.  At her age - you can run the shower really hot to create a lot of stem in the bathroom then turn the shower off and let her play on the bathroom floor.  I would do that with my son right before his bed time and it seemed to relax his lungs.    My last advice: seek a second opinion from another doctor.  Even a very good doctor can miss something so call tomorrow and make an appointment with another pediatrician to look at your daughter.    I hope she gets better soon.|`|cMpYz5B4aa	cool mist humidifier  vicks vapor plug ins at night  sleep the baby as upright as you can get her [try stuffing a couple pillows uder one side of the mattress]  saline solution & bulb syringe [only use 1/4 teaspoon for each nostril and  blow/suction in one motion]  and baby tylenol/motrin works wonders on little body aches|`|uLGqDh47aa	Try putting some vicks baby rub on her feet, back and chest(especially her feet). I tried that a couple weeks ago for my 4 month old baby cuz she had a cough. It helped tremendously! Just remember not to take her outside with it on her as she could catch pnemonia. make sure to keep socks over her feet while they have the vicks on them|`|CZue3vt0aa	you better be careful my friend had the same problem with her son she kept taking him to the doctor because of a cough that kept getting worse and the doctor told her the same thing. she then went to check with another docter because she began to worry for the same reason and the other docter told her her son had broncidous and that hes been having it they then told her to sue the other docter they had for not telling her sooner or helping. i suggest try another docter to see what they tell you just in case.|`|kyPV2D4kaa	My son had the same thing when he was about 5 months old. He had the same type of cough and was prescribed abutoral and singular. It turned out he didn't have allergies at all! If your baby stops wanting to eat BE CAREFUL! My son turned out to have RSV. He got better after being in the hospital a couple of days, but we were lucky! I would suggest seeing another doctor... soon.
q7sgWqZ3aa	A body temperature of 101o F and above can raise concerns during pregnancy. Some studies have shown an increased risk of birth defects in babies of women who had an increased body temperature during the first trimester of pregnancy.     I would get to a doctor if your temp gets that high again, it can be risky for your baby!|`|jNqf8HtDaa	it shouldnt be above 100 at all you should call your doctor tomorrow about it...|`|VD4JgFnGaa	its 96 if higher then 98  its bad for the baby|`|vaBVFsY3aa	It is risky, you should see your doctor. It must not bet higher than 100.    I hope everything is okay.|`|nic8GvOaaa	Your body temp shouldn't get that high its harmful for your baby. If you go to babycenter.com they have a lot of helpful information which could help you.|`|BVaOnbo2aa	You should really call your doctor now. He will either recommend some medication or have you go in to urgent care or possibly the ER because this can be VERY dangerous.

60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	I see you got the popular "spank him" answers.    I have a 4 year old who has never been spanked.  He would never swear, hit, throw things, tell me no, call me names, mock me, or do anything I tell him not to do.      You have to be consistent with discipline.  Inform him what you are about to do (at his level and make sure you have his full attention).  Then, count to 3 and give him a chance to change his behavior.  If he doesn't, take whatever it is he has away or remove him from the situation.  Stick to your guns.  Put him in time out for 4 minutes, take his favorite toys away.  There a tons of things you can do to correct this behavior but the  1 key is your consistency.    And, above all else, let him know when he's being good (not just bad).    As far as his TV addiction, you have the ability to stop that and the sooner, the better.|`|SsfnitjXaa	The boy needs his bio dad in his life.  A mother can not fill this role with a son.

My kids would rather drop dead than to pull a single stunt you mentioned...They are all almost in their teens now, all im dealing with is them bickering with each other. They know, and i have always told them....They are never to big for momma to take down...Now, if they were to tall for me to reach there mouth, i could tell them to drop to their knees so i could pop them one. Its called respect. As nasty as it may sound, i have it pretty good now with my kids...I have finally come to the easy part of being a parent. Good, polite, decent kids. Not anything like these monsters roaming around these days killing, cussing, hitting on there parents etc..its crazy....Just be careful, if you don't fix the problem when its easy you will cry for them one day and it will be very painful.    Ive never understood the time out and corner thing, its humiating and lonely! My kids were giving to me to care for, not throw in a corner to correct their mistake by themselves. My babies have seen the tears in my eyes because i didnt want to wipe...They learn from it too. Moms going to do what needs to be done, even when it hurts her too.i want to swift punish so i can hold them afterwards and talk about why they did it, and show they had to take the consequences. But WE talk about it and work through it, not their little minds in some corner or chair.|`|TDGhHIvNaa	Maybe you should sit down and ask him what the problem is.

Try to swallow your pride and tell your son's dad that he needs you in his life. I know you want him to think that youre doing fine without him and dont need him but you do need him. Your son needs him. Just by admitting you need help with your son he will see that your being honest and that you have changed. Do it for your little boy. It will benefit you too. Good luck, I have alot of respect for you being a single mom. Its the toughest job there is.

82ORY9UFaa	If there is a LOT of blood, this isnt normal at all and you should consult. Some women have spotting during the first couples weeks of the pregnancy, theres nothing to worry about. If this is tourmenting you, you should consult or call a doctor. A professional advice is always better, especially during pregnancy : being nervous wont help !|`|AA12095483	No, it isn't normal, and you need to see your doctor pronto.

I took a look at a couple skateboard shelves and, they would be a waste for the amount of stuff that he has.  You should have contiguous shelving.  Not broken, which would be the case with skateboard shelving.    The sports stuff he has, should all be organized neatly in his room.
upK8oN2oaa	Get him three cardboard boxes labelled.    1. Throw away/charity  2. 6 months  3 need    If he doesn't need the things in the 6 month box in 6 months they go to charity or are thrown away. Also he doesn't get the redo on his room until he really go's through his stuff.|`|SsfnitjXaa	Actually you have a bigger problem then a space issue.  Too bad you don't have a psych degree.

If he really can't part with it and wants it in site...could you install a shelf 16" from the ceiling all around his room and put his old toys up there?    Does he have a fav nephew that he would like to give his toys too?    Would he settle on keeping just a few of his old toys?    Please make sure that what ever you do that it is his decision, or he is going to resent you later on in life.  I am sure he could walk into your room and start tossing your treasures out with no problem.  In reality that is what you are trying to do with his stuff.  Please give him the respect he needs.  As you say he is growing into an adult.|`|2aFrHMLvaa	Aww, that's so adorable.

Enjoy him being a child, he is only 14. In our society there are so many young adults, 12, 13, 14 who have lost any site of being a child. They grow up too fast!    If wants to keep his toys, let him. You should be thankful! My sister is 18, in high school. In her freshmen years girls were pregnant, guys were going to jail for possession of drugs and there was a whole bunch of havoc!|`|n2O0NwR6aa	You could get him one of those beds that have drawers underneath it, where he could store some of his "kid things."  That way he could still keep them, but they wouldn't be out on display.

When my brother influenced my sister in reading books, she never stop until she finished it. ow she loves to read the stories found on different forums. I think try to introduce to him some teenage books. Like Nancy Drew, Harry Potter,,Narnia and Twilight. All best selling. While he is interested in the books, try to separate those toys that he loves and worthless and little by little remove it..  hehe..  it was my mother's trick, but for a kid like me it is hard for us to let some of our toys|`|3b799e3d18df0e460b9a42cf6e25aba5aa	I don't like the idea of you throwing your son's toys away. Yet if he can't have a teenage room and all his toys then he has a choice. Either he throws away enough of his toys so that a teenage room is possible or he keeps the toys and doesn't get his room.    Let it be his choice but be firm about it. His making the decision will contribute to his development into an adult man. He will often have to give up things in order to get something that he wants. At 14 y/o he can start the process now. Be clear that it is his decision, one or the other. If he whines and complains later, just tell him that he is the one who made the choice.    It sounds like you are a single mother. I'm not saying anything negative about that but if so I can understand how important it is to you for your son to be OK with the situation so that you can keep your close relationship.     I'm not telling you anything you don't already know when I say that as your son's parent that sometimes for his welfare, you must make decisions that he won't like. No matter what he says to try to manipulate you into doing what he wants you to do, he will still love you after you make the right decision for his welfare.     Even more importantly, he will appreciate the tough decisions that you made for his welfare because they will make him a happier and more successful adult.

I know two guys who didn't have middle names (one of them also just had an initial), so they gave themselves middle names and had their names legally changed.|`|KcfBOa9vaa	Harmony  Harriet  Hope  Hillary  Hermione    Elizabeth  Marilyn  Rose  Violet    Good luck!|`|TYRRjIv4aa	Jolene Hayley   Jolene Hope  Jolene Hannah  Jolene Holly   Jolene Heidi  Jolene Hazel  Jolene Harmony  Jolene Helena|`|082435507b63479df5aa4cf6de65fa39aa	In all honesty, I think it makes you quite unique. I wouldn't change it!|`|L4LPVtgfaa	I think you definitely need to keep the H as to not dishonour your parents. If your last name is a long one maybe keep to the shorter middle names (although i can't think of many longer ones)   Jolene Hannah   Jolene Hope  Jolene Heather   are the nicest sounding to me.     Best of luck    Or if you are realllly fed up with it........|`|5DK546BUaa	Jolene Hope Lastname  Jolene Hyacinth Lastname  Jolene Hosanna Lastname (From the Aramaic religious expression ???? ?? (Hosha' na') meaning "deliver us" in Hebrew)    Best of luck :)    http://www.behindthename.com/php/search....|`|IGcS9K62aa	Change your middle name, just pick a name that starts with H. You'll honor their decision that way, feel no guilt, and feel more confident about having a real middle name.    For example:  Helen  Hannah   Hayley  Harriet  Hosanna  Holly  Hope  Honor  Harra  Hayden  Helena  Hera    Just google it!|`|tHEBPDenaa	You could use Haley since it's close to Harley... you could even use Harley as a middle name... Harlow is very similar to Harley as well.   You could also use Hallie or Hayden. That's all I can think of!    Good Luck!|`|AA11391968	Jolene Hannah  Jolene Heidi  Jolene Holly  Jolene Harmony  Jolene Harlow  Jolene Heather  (I prefer Jolene Holly)|`|igvUbqkyaa	Holly - Jolene Holly

uhj76Fkpaa	sure they can!!    all my three children did!|`|kaqPSgTVaa	At two months no. I asked my doctor. Developmentally no. They can appear to with all their adorable noises but not laughter. :) It will come!|`|jNErU39iaa	Usually they will start to smile and coo around 6 weeks.  I think a more common age for babies to start *really* laughing is around 12 weeks.    That being said - my daughter started laughing in her sleep at nine weeks and continues to do so! It was so hard to get her to laugh while awake, but one day (when she was around 12 weeks) she started, and hasn't stopped =]|`|E5CnUdhsaa	my daughter giggled at 2 months:)|`|ZleVRevVaa	Yes dear.|`|H5wl4kqvaa	of course, and they mimic some facial expression because they can see close up|`|1zj4Lz9Raa	I don't think they can.|`|J6IOqzL0aa	mine s 2 months and when he smiles he laughs. it is in no way a proper laugh but itis the beginning of one without a doubt|`|dybuT8lFaa	my son laughed when he was 2 weeks old!
BVaOnbo2aa	Yes. I was 17 and fresh out of high school. It was with a boyfriend of 3 years and we had a ripped condom situation. Then to top it off, I miscarried the day after I told my mom (telling my mom was even horrific!)... and had to go to the hospital because there were complications. yada yada    I will be having my very first baby now at when I turn 40. (!!!!) I have had a full life of going out, traveling, parties, clubs, etc. And dating for a billion years, I finally found Mr. Right.    I could never be happier that life turned out the way it is now. None of the guys (including long term bf's) could ever have matched up. But also, I'm a totally different person now (I've learned how to see the whole package and accept there is such a thing as incompatibility) and have no regrets. :-)|`|Tp2HprvWaa	hell no, but my friend got preggers at 16 and a half  UGH!|`|bSDAdMfnaa	yip i was 18 when i found out i was pregnant, wasnt too sure what to do but lucky enuf i had my family and my partners support and financially i was okay i had just bought my own house and had a good stable job, wouldnt change my daughter for the world, now shes nearly 2 and my partner and i have been together 4 and half years.  But i must admit it has been hard with my daughter nothing prepares you enuf for a child x|`|Ws1hky6Zaa	no!!!|`|ZhrL1Vszaa	no|`|Xrwvu5Uraa	I was 20, shy a couple weeks of 21.|`|AhBM5w8maa	Yes,  I am pregnant now and I'm 17 and there is absolutely nothing wrong with it!|`|r39EDGhPaa	I'm a teenager and I KNOW I'm not going to get pregnant before I'm an adult.|`|C55pji5Qaa	NO|`|xOr67VDiaa	I hate ? like this lol  i was 18 but thats classed as an adult, so i wasn't a teenager. i seen a few ppl state there is nothing wrong with it, and im sorry but i think there is. I't may sound fun to have a baby, but what about your life? thats my question, how can any teenager make a decision weather they are willing to give their whole life up. They cant! and thats why so many young girls get pregnant, i know what i type doesnt matter cos nothing will ever change. I just wished to god they knew what they had b4 they decided to do something so serious like having a new beautiful baby, and babies are forever not just till they can do everything for them self, always your baby and they need someone that can give them great advice in everything they need to know, for me having a baby at 15,16, cant give such good advice, other than i was a young mom blah blah, they have their own life and have children when they are ready to give it up, and tell them the story ! its my opinion and i have every right to express it, im all for children and thats really all that matters to me, cos i have 4.. i made the decisions when i was far to immature to really understand! i can admit that, and i never regret what i did, i just wouldnt advise someone eles to do it, i would tell them you can do the same thing in so many better ways. its just they will never get it.|`|n2O0NwR6aa	Nope!|`|y9z65Rndaa	not me, but i still have a long time|`|osoTq2dcaa	no i didnt ... but my cousin did !|`|hUyhLeDWaa	Nope|`|aR1OiJ7Waa	You aren't supposed to.  There are actually very good reasons why not to.  If you need to hear them you won't understand them.|`|4b763bad020f3ed283fdcd243915642faa	nope lots of condoms, birth control pills and spermicide(together)  I think some women make it seem harder than it really is not to get pregnant. Accidents happen but lots of women just dont use the right precautions|`|jOyzcJd7aa	Yes. I'm a 19 year old army wife and I couldn't be happier :)|`|HxdV815Caa	no|`|9w8szzHjaa	O.o|`|H3x8tXbraa	What difference will it make to your life knowing.|`|0QbAiQwhaa	no I didn't because I was too busy being smart and using condoms and contraception...|`|ZuD07BKNaa	Hell NO!!!     its called BIRTH CONTROL!!!!|`|vGCEFrhuaa	Why would you ask that!|`|uxWc4Ivaaa	nope...i have a lot of living left to do!!!|`|OoaZGumxaa	Yes at 15. And it's no picnic. I decided to give her up for open adoption. I get to see her all the time and she is in a wonderful, caring, environment. Everyone's doing it, I just got caught. My daughter made me relieze a lot of things but I would never wish that on anyone.|`|ii0C0tfXaa	a couple months before i turned 18, i was with my boyfriend for almost 3 years and the birth control always worked before...but now i have a lil blessing about to be here :-)|`|lseXWdgLaa	no|`|be025e8eec4977bf6cdb9fb6f0765797aa	nope, but a friend got pregnant at 15. I wouldn't have been mature enough, although my friend wasn't either and still has to rely on her family to raise the child. I think guys should take more responsibility for things though, since the father of my friends child didn't bother with protection and then disappeared-even though he was +20.|`|5Eb8Zlqmaa	I'm 17, very close to turning 18, and I may be pregnant.  While I understand the typical stereotype for teenage mothers, I do not think it's fair for people to place judgment onto it.   I'm an extremely smart person, I've already graduated school, and I'm completely in love with my significant other [have been for five years now!]    I've known many friends with children, while some of them I agree were not suitable at their age you do the best you can.  If I am, I will do the best I can as well and give my baby everything. =]
C22jeMVhaa	I have a scar on my knee from falling while I was rock climbing once. I never bled, but I have this nasty looking  scar. So yes it can happen. You have to get hit really really hard though. There is a scar treatment they sell at most pharmacies though. I can't remember the name of it but it's in a purple box. It works best on my kids.
wKuQC4yTaa	lol...i know how u feel. I did the same 2 days ago. but everything will be fine.as long as we don't do it every day. I take it at bed time now so I remember at the same time every day|`|LKIhUMCgaa	it could if u did this on daily basis for a long time, but if it happens once in a while, then no. but taking too many vitamins can hurt u over time though also, like taking too much iron can cause stomach bleeding, for example.|`|o65klEwWaa	If you ate a whole bunch of them in one go it would be dangerous. But 2 instead of 1, on the odd occasion won't hurt.    If you are like most pregnant women, the pregnancy is never far from your thoughts and it is a normal part of pregnancy to worry about every little thing like that. You want to do right by the baby and you often have to make decisions yourself, that you'd rather have medical advice on except you can't call your specialist every minute of the day, etc etc.     You'll laugh about the paranoia once the baby arrives safely and begins to grow up.
75oU12V3aa	If you're only due in 2 weeks, you're ovulating around now possibly. The timing doesn't really make sense to me.     You started, finished, had sex. A week later your boobs got sore. How many days is that since you started? Is your cycle irregularly long?     Oh well, maybe it's just me that doesn't get it, but there is always a chance that it was due to ovulation and conception. My cycle was 46 days long at the time I conceived.    I hope you get the results you want!|`|kaqPSgTVaa	It's probably more due to you ovulating. Women ovulate about 2 weeks before they are due for their period so that's probably what it's from. It's also a little early for pregnancy symptoms so I doubt it's due to pregnancy.|`|uxWc4Ivaaa	its normal...due to ovulation...|`|LKIhUMCgaa	eh, that's wut happened to me. i had sex on the last day of my period, a week later my boobs were really sore, so as my nipples, cramps, then i spotted, a week b4 my period was due i said fk it and took a test, and now helping my mom to plan my baby shower :D|`|nyDPFTT7aa	You are probably ovulating thats why your boobs are sore. If you think you are pregnant i would wait at leat 5 days before you period as it will be more accurate. Good Luck.xx|`|Ws1hky6Zaa	normal, it is ovulation. if you were prego they wouldnt hurt that soon.
taQFWXuHaa	actually i have heard of something similar... but the one i heard involves a necklace over your abdomen and if it goes in a circle its a girl and if it sways side to side its a boy..|`|uRuoINt0aa	hi, dear..    i think during pregnancy we find so many new things to experiment that we are just over the moon all the time and want some or the other thing going on..(lolls..!!) well i too love them...but never heard of any such thing well i only know the RING TEST..which is done by your engagement ring which is hanged over your bump using a thread & if it goes in circles you have a boy & if your having a girl it will go side to side...well i will for surely try your way when i get back home & will tell you the results tomorrow..!!    hope you are doing good...well how many weeks are you along dear..  keep me posted how things are going on your side...would love to keep in touch with you..and ya try my method also & let me know the results..    hope i have helped..|`|6988FTAYaa	my sister in law done this to me with my first child and she was dead right it was a boy..so im consider her to do it again with this child!!|`|6cN8aLnaaa	I've heard of this and done it when I was a kid but don't remember the results. I had a girl. lol|`|rkSBHqtQaa	I did this with my second baby. But I did the one with the necklace over your abdomen. Mine went in a circle and if I remember correctly its supposed to be a girl and I had a BOY! Lol. Either way it was fun to try.|`|rVNdYGHmaa	sort of herd about this but the one i herd is with a necklace over the persons palm... and if it circles its a girl and if its straight back n forth its a boy... mine was dead on

I didn't start my daughter on any solids until well in to her sixth month.|`|5f6XnInEaa	My son adores pumpkin, sweet potato and potato.  No rice cereal for my boy, he hates it.    Our guidelines here are 4-6 months, it's weird how different countries have different information, or different doctors I should say.    Thumbs down for following guidelines set by my nurse?  Somebody is cranky, and uneducated  tonight.|`|jNErU39iaa	None - your not supposed to feed your baby until they are 6 months old, unless specifically told to do so by your pediatrician|`|UsNgFI7haa	none at 5 months old you should only be giving your baby formula and that is it you should not start foods until around 6 to 7 months talk to your babies doctor about when you should start your baby on food|`|50BdfHuDaa	If you breastfeed or formula,  mix with baby rice and serve.  Stage 1 baby foods are good at this point. Stage 2 should be around 9 months.  Stage 3 at 12 months. Also, at 13 months a baby should be able to eat gerber graduates meals. my daughter is 14 months old and she loves the mac n cheese one the best.  she also eats table food chopped up into tiny edible pieces. Every babies development is different and there is no right time for anything except from the makers of the products out there.  best advise.|`|4c6e468cbbff2f4f9f9f53c98f6d12acaa	cereals all kinds stage 1 some stage 2 foods   my daughter is 5 months old and she's been on solids since 2 months now she is on all stage 2 foods it just depends on your baby if the can tollerate the food yet good luck with it>>

See a doctor about the symptoms you've been getting but you are on the pill and you had a period, even if it was late it was a period. Women don't get periods while pregnant. You also would have gotten a positive pregnancy test by now. Relax and see a doc about the symptoms they can be caused by many things.|`|FCFdYuchaa	confirm  http://pregnancy-parenting-guide.blogspo...|`|mdBR9Ynxaa	your prob. not pregnant peoples periods are irregular sometimes. im sure you'll be ok. good luck!|`|Zca1PGERaa	i dont think your pregnant sometimes periods become irregular start then stop then come back. the darker blood is older blood.|`|vaBVFsY3aa	I don't think you are pregnant.

Hp8JPP8Baa	When they were real little like 4-8 ish Now just maybe a chocolate heart shapped lolipop type thing or just a lil something so she knows I thought of her! Even a little Love note tucked in her lunch! Buy a bag of Valentine M&M's and put them in a zip lock in lunch w/ note.|`|mE9X0dXMaa	I remember my Mom would always have little Valentines out on the kitchen table for my siblings and I when we got uo on Valentines Day. It was nothing big, just a little card and maybe a few little candies. It wasn't about what she got us, but just that she was thinking of us.|`|KTGSXjvfaa	My girls are 11 & 9 and I have ALWAYS got them something for V-Day, a stuffed animal or box (small) choc. And I get them each a nice cute card from my husband and I. They really enjoy this and so do we :)|`|n2O0NwR6aa	Yes, usually a box of candy and maybe a stuffed animal.  For my daughter, I might get her a pair of heart earrings or some type of v-day jewelry.|`|ouEix2a2aa	Since I only have one who is a grown man he should be giving me a Valentine gift after nine months plus 18 years with his crap :-)|`|rhreN8wbaa	my dad always gets me a box of chocolates  maybe its a father daughter thing but i think its nice.|`|OK5hZG6Qaa	I always get my kids a stuffed animal and some candy no matter what their ages!|`|es6l59Unaa	For my girls i bought them each a pair of valentines pajamas and a card that was a recipe for love..

2VtkgzcIaa	I think it's great!!  Yes, there are a lot of different website that have tons of information.. but they are nothing compared to advise from a real mom/woman. I could look up answers to all of my questions on websites, but I choose to come here to get advise and tips from real people who have experienced the things I am going through. So, thanks to you and all the other moms/women who help us all out!!!|`|TM3pNz6kaa	I don't think its any different than raising kids ten- twenty years ago then to what it is today only New technology and pediatric advice has changed infant and child care has changed but the mothers haven't, i like hearing advice from older mothers who are/were use to raising kids on the bare necessity's, and only having the basics. We are living in a society today that will eventually return to the basics where parenting is concerned if the world keeps going the way it is. But that's my opinion.|`|xOr67VDiaa	I think its great!! but im sure even the older moms learnt from their mistakes, so thats what most of us young moms do, so when were their age we will be the more knowledge and be able to give great advice to our younger generation, i love how the young woman learn a lot from here, its a good thing and when they are serious about the ? they ask and get an answer, then what eles can ppl do for ppl they dont even know?|`|8SyUHkPXaa	Since I have kids that range in age from *gasp* 31 to 6 years old, I think I have plenty to offer and learn.|`|OoaZGumxaa	Couldn't have said it better myself JM!|`|nic8GvOaaa	I think its very helpful, hearing about their experiences and seeing how they can help us with ours. Also all the information which is online and we can access is unbelievably insightful for first.time mothers like myself. The only down falls which I have found are that not all woman are the same, and we cannot always find the answers for the questions we should really be asking our doctors. Also when visiting this site its hard to find serious question from users because there are so many irresponsible people asking the same question over and over again. Honestly how many times do people have to ask if they should take a test if they had unprotected sex the night before and claim to be having signs of pregnancy already. Other then that I believe its a wonderful resource that everyone can access. Im thankful to all the mothers which take time and help us with our questions on this site.|`|ouEix2a2aa	The more we read, the more we learn skills necessary to do more difficult daily assignments or tasks.  We learn from each other even though technology is a handicap for the young.  The young always has to fall back for some old school techniques.|`|8nIEuXplaa	Hi Mate  As you know I am neither young or a Mom. However Ann & I have raised 5 fantastic kids and we always listened to the advice of our Mothers mainly because they have already been there and done that.

Yes, always take into consideration, Dr's advice and newer technologies. Yet, much credit to some of the tried and true lessons of the past!|`|IGcS9K62aa	Older moms are the best--online and in real life! My mother and grandmother are my best sources for info pertaining to my daughter! A few of their practices maybe a little behind in the times but they are still tremendously helpful!|`|pwu9xzF8aa	i dont really think the answers differ all that much between the ages.

eXsR8Gx5aa	Personally no, the only "designer" stuff my son has were gifts - I have in mind a Ralph Lauren Polo shirt he's yet to grow into - No way in hell I'd buy that for him!    Most of my sons clothes are from supermarkets, eBay, Vertbaudet (using the massive discount codes never full price!)    If people want to do that as gifts then fine but I do feel a bit uncomfortable - like you say & Lynne points out, its only going to get wrecked - whats the point?    I also regularly donate (by way of old clothes) to oxfam etc - I also use their online second hand store which is another way of donating cash to them. (I just got myself some really nice things and didn't have to go trawling through racks of stuff!)    Who in the hell would use Gucci nappies? I had no idea they even existed!!    Not long ago there was a "question" on here from a mum who was basically bragging about all of the designer labels her baby is dressed in - seriously who cares? Times are hard, you think my son will look back on his baby pics and ask why he's not in head to toe armani? Hmmmmmmm    Sorry, I went off on one a bit then didn't I?    I can dress my son for a fiver and often do - he still looks gorgeous!    Today he has on . . .     Beige Next cords 1.50 from eBay  A beige Vertbaudet l/s top - free because I was buying xmas gifts for niece & nephew!  A Next fleece jumper with cute design 2.00 eBay.  A vest from Primark  Red Herring Socks 5 pairs for 2 in the sales!!|`|CY8jAXPDaa	No i definitely wouldn't spend that much on clothes for cory, because he always gets all his food in his clothes and stains them. I used to have to keep buying new clothes every week it was costing me a fortune.   It doesn't happen now though, thankfully.  My boyfriend thinks im ridiculous for paying 17 on jumpers for him  and 20 on Clark's shoes, but im a definite believer in you pay for what you get.  So at the age Reece is now i wouldn't of dreamt of buying him jumpers for 17, i would of nipped into primark or gone in the sales, or used tesco or asda clothes for him.|`|lL3Wa5PKaa	My son is 14 months and don't get me wrong im all about spoiling him but spending that much money of clothes for your children when they're that young is ridiculous. They grow so fast that its like throwing your money away. At that age he'll only wear it for a month and if you're lucky maybe two. I love going all out but you can buy things that are just as cute for a lot cheaper... and you can make you're money go a lot further!|`|Kl1h5dCaaa	I have 5 Sons, do you really think I could afford to??    The designers we have are usually bought at sales, or second hand. My Boys, are very active, and fast growers. I could not justify that much on something that will last a month.|`|Oxdkporsaa	No way, babies grow so much over the first year that by next week the outfit could not fit him any more.   Also with crawling etc the knees become frayed & tattered.  Also if you have a teething baby you will have loads of dribbling & drooling which damages the clothes also.  The only time I would spend that amount on a young child is for a special occasion, but everyone is different & your mum might just think its ok to spend that amount of money. Have a quite word with her if it upsets you so much, maybe suggest she could put the money into an account for him which will be useful in years to come rather on an outfit which will only last a few months.|`|B9lNQxRlaa	I definatley wouldn't spend that much on baby or toddler clothes as they either grow out of it too quickly or it gets wrecked from them crawling around and just being kids.  But if people want to buy it for you - then let them - yay for you - if it is still in reasonable condition when he has grown out of it, either save it for the next baby or sell it on ebay or whatever you guys have in your country.|`|LbkLg4RFaa	I was just curious how much in AUD that was and just did a conversion and nearly fell off my chair.  That's roughly $250 Aussie dollars so personally I wouldn't considering what they can do to clothes at that age.  Grandma's just can't seem to help it though.|`|63bxt86taa	I would buy designer clothes if i liked them enough and if we were going anywhere special or he was getting his photos done or something, not for general wear... 40 for tiny little jeans is insane!! who can tell by looking at them what make they are?!?!|`|xy0W50Lqaa	Yes babies grow out of clothes so quickly and I'm aware of that when I buy clothes.  I have bags full of lovely clothes my daughter has now grown out of and I've put away.  (I'm secretly hoping I will have another girl one day)  I have never bought ridiculously expensive clothes but expensive to me would be places like Rocha little Rocha at Debenhams and Next.  I buy their clothes for special occasions, photo shoots, and as a treat like when she has had injections.|`|ZYlr9TSBaa	Probably not, cos they're at the age where they're mobile plus they grow so quickly.|`|63a5d617239afd4f62c7622fb8d95be3aa	No, never! My daughters clothes all come from asda or tesco lol. My favourite outfit to put on her only cost me 14. They out-grow them so fast and they always get dirty and stained I don't see the point!     It was a nice gift from your mum so maybe save it for special occasions so they don't get destroyed.|`|jNErU39iaa	No, I wouldn't. However, when my daughter was born we were given soo many expensive clothing items and toys from friends and family that we never even would have considered buying because of the ridiculous high prices!    I think that when people buy gifts like that it is out of novelty, because they aren't the ones who are continually buying clothes for the baby =]  I think it's a lovely gesture to buy clothing as a present for baby, whether they are expensive or not =]|`|r7q8LW7Aaa	Honestly, I think spending that amount of money on something that will likely get puked on is not only pointless, it's irresponsible. There's a global recession here and there are so many better places for the money to go to, or better things to spend it on. It was like the Beckhams - who apparantly used Gucci (or some similar label) nappies for their sprogs! Hello? How about using Pampers like the rest of us and put that wasted money to charity! And before someone jumps on me, I regularly donate to Great Ormond Street Hospital, The RSPCC and Oxfam. Also, when I have some spare cash, I send money to my dad, who is raising my 3 young sisters without financial help from their (and my) mother.  I'm happy with Cherokee, George, Next, sometimes even Matalan. There is no need to spend a fortune on baby clothes when they get so little use of them.  Mummy Berry - great tip with Oxfam, I'm gonna have a look!
K2jT1z5jaa	Hey.  You middle name is :    UniQue & Pretty & DifferEnt ~~    i like it, i reckon its different to other names.  God Bless x|`|45nSn7Rcaa	It's different but a lot of people have very different middle names.  Most people don't know each others middle names though so why would it even matter.|`|QDrAGIOeaa	That is a pretty unique name (middle name), never heard of it before|`|6988FTAYaa	uh sweetie this question shouldnt be here!! these questions are bout pregnancy!! but yes its and alright name!|`|jYPeis3Saa	sounds made up.  not normal.|`|vCDU8MsTaa	I don't really like it...it's a little too trendy for my taste :)  But it could be a lot worse!  My middle name is Per-soons. Not kidding. With the hyphen and all. It was my great-grandmothers name, and she was a Shuswap Native, so the unusual-ness of it is kinda cool to me.|`|qt4Shm2caa	sounds like an irish R&B singer.|`|6e86b83705cfddccf58af904227b4e43aa	sound sexy, i like it|`|Pq48dNPUaa	First off, are you a girl or guy. What's your first name, does it flow nicely when you say your full name. I can't really answer without that BUUUUUTTT, if you want to know just by itself then no, it's not that attractive, and it's normal because a middle name can be whatever your parents want it to be, it seriously almost makes no difference in your life so it can be literally whatever you want.|`|GLQL2IEaaa	at least it's not LaVoice ...|`|hAFDi7qBaa	I think (after saying your name out loud) that your middle name is nice.  I don't know about the normal part, I have never heard it before, but that is what makes people unique.  Have you asked your parents how they came up with it?  There are usually some neat stories behind names.    Have fun|`|AA11747374	is it pronounced JayDawn? Are you a boy or a girl?  Have you hear of anyone else of the same sex with that middle name?  Why does it bother you?|`|19bXXhXxaa	It is kinda weird, but at least ur not my friend- she was made fun of for years because her middle name is Mercedes.
DwsHXG30aa	I couldn't agree with out more!It is impearitive that parents have the control in the situation and do not allow the child to be disruptive. I praise parents all of the time for thier efforts in ensuring that children recieve positive praise for good behavior and negative feedback for negative behavior. As long as the parent keeps their cool. Some parents just look down right evil and disturbed when leaving and you wonder what will happen to the child later on. Thanks for the great question!|`|IGcS9K62aa	I think you are completely right. I am a mom myself and I firmly believe that if the child cannot behave properly they have not earned the privilege. I believe there should be some reprimand, but not at the expense of others. Remove the child from the situation and explain why they have lost the privilege. "If you can't behave like a big girl, you can't have the privilege like a big girl." Once a child learns that certain behavior is required they will oblige.     I use privilege so much because excursions out in public are just that. The child does not have a right to go to the park or play place. They earn it by demonstrating their ability to handle it. Also you're the parent you shouldn't reason with a child. You give them the reason and explain it.|`|xOr67VDiaa	i think youre worried too much about what others think of you, children are children and they mostly act out when they are having so much fun or bored as hell.. if ppl cant understand,(ppl are so judgmental) then who cares, children are children. no you shouldnt let them act out for no reason, if they are tired that is a reason and if ppl cant understand it then the hell with them, my kids are good kids but they carry on in public, i just tell them to stop eles we will go home, i dont give a **** what other ppl think, they dont do anything for me or my kids, and being judgmental is just a way of them not knowing anything about me or my family.|`|HAZheqlCaa	no. your doing the right thing be teaching them whats right an wrong.. my parents did it to me an my siblings. and well we kno how u feel.  i wouldnt want my kids acting up.. or being disrespectful.    in the long run. your kids will thank you    hope this helped|`|uhBkbgoaaa	SWEETIE , IF THATS HOW YOU HANDLE IT THEN BE IT , I HAVE A 8 MONTH OLD SO I DONT KNOW ABOUT TENTRAUMS SO MUCH YET, BUT I THINK YOU ARE RESPECTFUL TO OTHERS SO YOU SHOULDNT FEEL AWKWARD ABOUT IT.|`|GnXfEdegaa	Yes, you are sure right.  I saw it yesterday afternoon at the library.  The mom said to her child, "I warned you if you didn't act right we would be leaving"  The kid complained, "I'll stop now, mommy"  She said, "too late"  I was proud of her and I didn't even know her but mom to mom I was proud that she handle the issue that way.  It takes guts.  I know this isn't the same thing as a restaurant issue but a little similar.  Anyway, there are moms and dads like you and me and my dh out there that want their kids to behave in public it's just that I think there are more the "other way".|`|71b04ae04f4a311b132775b2d931bd76aa	I agree that in most cases it is probably best to remove the child from the situation.  Not as a punishment, but because they probably need to be taken home for a nap, or just out of the environment.  It's not fair to set kids up for failure and then make everyone suffer.     It's easier said than done though, sometimes parents really need to be out doing things like getting groceries, or have other kids who would be upset at leaving, or maybe the parent is about to lose their mind and just needs to be out among adults instead of trapped at home for another day.|`|89fc809291d1b95a8d32164fe467ae3baa	I agree with you. You should remove them but at the same time punish them because they might get used to throwing the tantrum just ton get out of some place. But don't worry abput the other people so much. Do it for your children so they learn to behave. I also hate making other people uncomfortable, and it teaches the kids to be embarassed to when they need to. If not they will think that behaving like that has no effect on anyone and will keep doing it.   good luck,|`|BnYrOfYraa	Lol, I agree with KeepItreal.  Although I think you sound more like you're trying to accolades for your 'perfect' parenting rather than caring what other people think of you.    Look, kids are kids.  They throw tantrums sometimes.  While I think all parents have grand ideas of leaving where they are when their kids start to act up, sometimes you have to get things done.    Good luck with your fourth baby.
AA11763588	1st Stop Stressing, stress will cause strong contractions   2nd Lay down, put your feet up  3rd Drink lots of water, 100% Fruit Juice or Gatorade    Just calm down. They wouldn't send you home if you or the baby wasn't doing well.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	Stay relaxed and rest. If you work,call in.|`|5BiVD3tbaa	to put you at ease. they wouldn't send you home if they didn't feel you were stable. if they had a huge concern you would be admitted to the hospital as an antepartum so for them to send you home is a good thing!!! rest and ly your feet on a few pillows above your head. take it easy. bed rest!!!|`|AA10436595	It sounds more like that stomach virus that's going around, especially the achingm vomiting and stomach pains.  Relax!  They checked you and didn't think you were miscarrying.  Good luck with your new baby and congratulations.|`|82ORY9UFaa	As the others said, the hospital wouldnt send you home ESPECIALLY PREGNANT if you and the baby were in danger, so you are fine, best thing to do is to relax, drink a lot of water. Bed time is important since you feel weak: put a pillow under your belly. Contraction are normal, some women get them early thats means your uterus is getting ready and not thats youre going to be in labor. The labor contraction area LOT more painful and you'll defenitively know you're baby is on the way.    If you are worried about miscarriage, call your gynecologist asap, hell examine you, see if your baby is fine and you'll feel a lot better :)|`|y5sWmbtnaa	you know that no matter what any one tells you on Y!Answers that you should call a doctor when you are having serious concerns such as preterm labor. So i would call your doctor, no matter what time of the day it is. I hope you are ok sweetie!    i have not a single clue why someone would disagree with asking a medical professional about something like this, the life of your unborn baby can be at risk , you should call your doctor if you are indeed haveing contractions that are painful.  I realize you were there already but if you are still concerned then you should let them know especially since you are still contracting.|`|7lr9Da1Gaa	Not that im trying to scare you. But some hospitals and doctors can be such idiots at times. Maybe you are having preterm labor. Ive been through this 4 times before. I was also 23 weeks when I had my first baby she was premature. I had a placenta abruption and my baby didnt survive she was only 1 pound and her lungs werent developed. I highly recommend you go to another hospital. Those shots you mentioned didnt help me when I had another my second daughter. They had to give me magnesium sulfate. She was born premature also at 26 weeks. Just to make it clear NO I dont use drugs or drink either!!     I wish you the best and plz go to another hospital or give your oncall doctor a buzz!
wKuQC4yTaa	very normal and gets more frequent as your pregnancy goes on|`|y5sWmbtnaa	I had this recently and when I went to the doctor and asked him "What is this clear thin and watery stuff' he looked at me and looked at my husband and said its your body trying to work extra hard to keep things out of the cervix. In other words I think he was saying that it was in super cleaning mode because we had been having sex.|`|qmmu6hv5aa	Things are just beginning to change in your body, its all normal. Unless you start bleeding you shouldn't be concerned! Relax as much as possible especially til your 12 weeks mark, it will come before you know it i promise!!
sAAnquoTaa	If i had a boy I'd def do it. They don't remember the pain if that's what people are worried. Of course you feel bad for them, but it will be better for them in the end. It's cleaner, so less infections, and obviously one reason is the apearance.|`|OWOtKZmgaa	cruel and unthinkable why do parents continue doing this evil sh-- to their babies and children and worst of all think they are doing the boy some sort  of kindness ? wtf is that about . circumcision is old fashioned and should be illegal its benefits no longer stack up and the dangers are now well known not to mention the terrible pain the victim suffers as no significant pain relief can be given, the bare glans left is open to constant contact with clothing and of the 24,000 nerves in penis circumcision removes 20,000 !!!!!! ouch . i have a natural penis and would never consider  circumcision for myself or any boy children i have in future.   nature made your baby perfect so why cut it up|`|dOpKsNYcaa	Well, all the boys on here think it's horrible (including myself) and the only ones who seem to think it's so great are the girls, so what does that tell you? If female circumcision was the popular trend in the US and all the men were for it (like they are in Africa and the middle east) but the women were against it, what would that tell you?|`|KmQFiPCdaa	Sorry...  but I personaly find it disgusting that people do this to their babies and think that it makes them a wonderful parent and the fact that they just think it's okay!  That is the part that realy shocks me, why do people think it's okay!  There are no medical benifits and ever if there were that doesn't make it okay, it's still wrong to violate your childs body.  I just don't get why some parent's think of their child as a piece of property. "Oh he's my child and what I do with him is my buisness not yours" I'm sorry but when you pay some guy to strap your child and have them rip apart of his genitals off it becomes my buisness.   I don't get why parent's think that just because they are parents they can do what ever they please and just because they are the parents that somehow makes it okay. Well I'm sorry but it doesn't.  I feel sorry for those children who have to live the rest of their life with half their genitals because their mother wanted it. I'm sorry but this is the United States of America, people have human rights, and I feel sorry for those kids that have had their human rights taken away by the last person that you would exspect to do so.  I'm sorry I really am, I know you don't understand how I think it's cruel but wth all due respect I don't get why you think it's okay.  It's your son's penis, just because he's your son doesn't mean you get the power to mutilate it.  I'm sure he will thank you later on for having half the sensitivity as a natural normal man.  Parent's need to realize that it's your child but it's also a human being, your rights only go so far and this crosses the line.  Parent's need to stop abusing their power as parents.    EDIT*******: I'm sorry but what "thubachoi" said was digusting. I think it's disgusting to do that as a wright of passage. Plus at 12 they won't understand what they are giving up and they will be forced into it and that's not any better than doing it as a baby.  Plus that's EXACTLY what people say in other countries in Africa and other parts of the world about circumcising females. Where they remove the clitoris and the labia and sew the inner labia together. They see it as a wright of passage into womanhood.   I think it's demeaning to sit there and say that it's a wright of passage. How is a guy having a cut up penis "manly". I think having a whole penis is manly.  Why don't you let guys decide on what they want when it comes to circumcision. I think a woman needs to stay as far away from it as she can, because unless you are going to get your genitals cut up yourself, you are just being sexist towards your child.    I'm sorry but I think that's disgusting.  It's a sick ritual that needs to stop.    Let the guy deicde if he thinks it's manly or should be his rite of passage, but at 12 they aren't going to understand what they are giving up sexualy.  The forskins has about 4 times as many nerve endings than the head of the penis.|`|AA11587429	It is a weird concept/ procedure.    I have very sensitive skin, and much of my life I've had skin irritation on my scrotum.  The natural creases in the skin get red and raw.  I've tried tons of creams, rubbing alcohol, jock itch meds, switching underwear material... none help.  I'm glad I'm circumcised... with all that extra moisture underneath foreskins I'm sure I'd have irritation there too.|`|a454ee46524abf792eec0686abd82584aa	I do think it's horrible and resent my own circumcision deeply.  Circumcision is the amputation of the foreskin, not extra skin but an integral part of the penis; measuring 15 square inches in an adult and accounting for over half the penile skin, lots of specialised nerve endings and the most sensitive parts of the penis.   Not one major medical organisation in the world recommends routine infant circumcision anymore.   The penis forms as one organ and at birth the foreskin is usually fused to the glans like a fingernail to its finger. So there is no cavity for germs and dirt to collect in until it separates naturally later; at an average age of 10. Only the boy himself should retract it and then he can be taught to skin back and rinse with plain water regularly.  Misguided attempts to retract too early, often by doctors and nurses, are the main cause of damage to boys foreskins and the real main reason for childhood circumcisions.  To perform a neo-natal circumcision the circumciser has to rip the foreskin away from the glans with forceps. Then the foreskin is either cut away or clamped until it falls off. Both methods cause the baby extreme pain and his raw glans and wound sting every time he urinates. It's quite common for the raw edges of the cut foreskin to fuse to the raw glans during the healing process, forming skin bridges or tags. These complications and other more serious ones are often not found till puberty and do not show up in complication statistics.   More serious complications, though not common are immediate. Some babies lose their penis to infection, bleed profusely (often because they are haemophiliac) or even die each year.    The claimed benefits of circumcision are a beat up (based on flawed studies) and don't really exist but medical authorities have worked out that the overall complication rate is higher than all the benefits claimed by the pro-cutting advocates. One by one the claims are disproved but the pro-cutting zealots come up with more and keep quoting the old ones despite the evidence against them. For example you have more chance of dying from a circumcision or losing your penis from infection than from penile cancer. The rate of penile cancer is higher in the largely-circumcised USA than in European countries where less than 1% of the male population is circumcised. Plus circumcised men have been found to have penile cancer, mostly on the scar. (Remember this is a very rare disease in intact or circumcised men).  A very recent study in New Zealand followed a cohort of boys through life from birth to age 32. About 40% were circumcised. The intact males had a slightly lower rate of sexually transmitted infections than the circumcised but there was no significant difference.  Using surgery to mutilate the genitals instead of washing in a modern western society makes no sense. Normal intact male genitals are, if anything, easier to wash than female ones and the same substance, smegma collects in the genital folds of both sexes. A few intact males have problems with tight foreskin but this is only a tiny proportion of intact males. The condition can now be almost always treated with simple stretching exercises, sometimes in combination with a steroid cream that speeds up the process.   . I wish I'd been given the chance to choose for myself. Intact men can choose to get cut at any time in their life, though most have no desire to do so. The internet has shown that many men resent being circumcised. It's just not something that most of us talk about a lot, even to our parents.  Any boy born now will grow up with many intact friends, even in the USA and there is every chance he will resent this unnecessary cosmetic surgery.  Geoff|`|TsjqzanQaa	If you think that circumcision is so great, why don't you have a female circumcision done to yourself so that you can experience first-hand the "benefits" of it.        Oh, don't use anaesthetic,, also, you "won't remember the pain."    It will look "better,"    it's "cleaner."     Perhaps then you will understand how it feels to be scarred, mutilated and deprived of sexual sensitivity for the rest of you life.    No?     You wouldn't have it done to yourself?    Because it's mutilation?    That's exactly what it is, genital mutilation is genital mutilation, regardless of the sex on which it's peerpetrated.    It is cruel, abnormal and unnatural, a barbaric disfigurement of the body.    In this day and age, most enlightened people don't chop off parts of helpless infants bodies.    You had one boy mutilated, and now you may do it to another?  If you're not happy with the way your children are born, then you shouldn't have them in the first place.    Circumcision always damages the penis and sexual sensitivity, and causes many complications.    Circumcision is the worst hoax ever perpetrated on the male sex.    A foreskin is not a birth defect; it is a birthright.    ERIC|`|Yb99bIdnaa	They definitely DO feel the pain, though infants don't form "memories" like we think of it, the intense pain of having the foreskin ripped from the glans before it's amputated actually causes chemical changes in the baby's brain.    Months and years later, when receiving vaccination shots, circumcised boys cry louder and longer than intact boys or girls. Their pain response is altered by the circumcision, and there's evidence to suggest these changes persist into adulthood.|`|nGkCWpRVaa	its cruel and should be baned|`|FCFdYuchaa	confirm  http://pregnancy-parenting-guide.blogspo...|`|K4zsztkRaa	Of course I think it's wrong.  It's the childs body, not the parents. No parent has the right to make a body altering, life changing, perminant choice for a child. I don't care if it's their child or not, no one has the right to make that choice for another human being.     I think it's horrible because it was done to me. I thought my parents job was to protect me and keep me and my body safe untill I could make the choice on what to do with it. It was wrong of my parents to force their beliefs on me physicaly.    Also circumcision takes away a lot of sexual feeling, it's worong of parents to step in and take away a childs genital sensitivity without asking them if it's okay.   How come there is a law that says no one can alter how a female recieves pleasure for sex but anyone can just walk in and take my enjoyment out of it away?  I am restoring my foreskin, my head is covered 24/7 and my head is not constantly rubbing against my clothes and becomeing less and less sensitive with time. The calous that developed over my head is now gone and I have about twice the feeling in my head and my orgasms are more intense and last longer. Also sex lasts longer because I enjoy it more.  I don't think it's right for a parent to take that from their child without consulting the childs consent.    A circumcision does not have to be done a birth, it can be done at any age. So therfore it shouldn't be done unless the person the penis is attached to wants it done. Infact getting it done when you are older is better. There is a severly reduced risk that the circumcision will be botched. It's a fact that 1 out of 10 infant circumcisions gets messed up in some way but most problems that follow into adulthood go unnoticed or untreated. Also it hurts much less as an adult, babies go through a lot more pain and just because they can't remember it doesn't mean anything.  If you are going to make tht arguement then you are saying that it's okay to rape and molest young children because they won't remember it. Just because they won't remember it doesn't mean you can do what ever you want to the child.    Also this is the main reason why I'm against it, circumcision has a long list of serious risks. SOME of them include:  persistant bleeding  hemmorage  ulceration  loss of penis  loss of glans penis  serioius infection (one boy was left blind and retarted after his circumcision infection got to his brain)  brain dammage   Post traumatic stress syndrome  persistant crying that leads to hernias or internal bleeding or stomach ulcers.  Gangreene of the penis  Also death (it's more commen than people know of)    I don't think that it's right for a parent to risk their childs life, health, and well being for a surgery that hasen't been reccomended by the American Academy of Pediatrics since 1990, and for a comsetic procedure, without their childs permission.    I watched a documentarty on circumcision where a women came over here from Ethiopia. She was circumcised as a little girl and had her clitoris removed. When she came here and people found out about what she had gone through they felt disgusted that people could ever do this to their child and they felt like it was a violation of human rights. This woman was even more disgusted by the fact that the same people that thought what happened to her was an injustice, that male circumcision was okay and it was a different matter. To her they were both the same, rights violating ritual and they both should be illegal. If a female going through that thinks it's the same then someone that didn't go through it doesn't have the right to a vote about them being different.    I agree, infant circumcision of males or females is a violation of human rights, no parent has the right to force their beliefs on a child without their consent and take away a perfectly normal, healthy, functioning part of their childs body because of their prefrence.  It's the childs choice.  Parent's are sapposed to protect their babies, not hurt them for no reason.    Circumcision has no medical benifits.  It's not cleaner, it's not healthier, it doesn't prevent infections or STD's.  Plus that not up to you to decide. If your son doesn't wash that's his problem not yours, stay out of it.  Maybe if some American parents wouldn't be so irresponsable and teach their children how to shower or wear condoms then maybe we wouldn't cut up half the boys born in theis country everyday.    Just my oppinion but I believe that circumcision promotes pure laziness and shallowness. Also it promotes that robbing a child of their healthy intact genitals is okay, when it's so far from okay.  It's barbaric.      That's my opinion.    I just wanna add that you said you didn't understand why people found it to be horrible, that's why I find it to be horrible. I don't mean to offend anyone but that's how I see what was forced on me as a child and what is forced on many other innocent males.    Circumcision is no longer a medical procedure, it's now a cosmetic procedure (under the same name as a nose job) that's why very, very few insurance companies cover a circumcision.  I wouldnt' force a nose job on my daughter because I think she won't be happy with the nose she was born with, I leave that choice up to her. Besides she should no self esteem doesn't come from other people.  A nose job is gonna hurt when she get's it done later in life, but I shouldn't try to make the choice for her as a baby just so she can't "remember" the pain. If you want it bad enough pain doesn't matter people need to stop being babies, this is a day and age with pain medication. (babies however can't have pain medication)    -Connor|`|VmSKQ40Caa	It is so fu(king wrong! What do you Americans not get about it? I am an intact male, I have my foreskin, and I love it, if someone cut mine off, I am suing them immediately. Something I just noticed is that all these stupid as heck American FEMALES think it should be, done, yet most of the males do not want it to be done to the boy and think it should be illegal, like Connor said. This is because these retarded females do not have penises, and their ignorance blinds them, so they just decide to mutilate their son's penis because they can not make good decisions.

I'm against parents circumcising a boy for no reason in particular other than "to look like daddy" or because they "think" its cleaner. Do these people not have access to soap? Or are they too lazy to teach their son about hygiene one day?    Circumcision has never been categorically proven to be of medical benefit, and the American Academy of Pediatrics say the evidence is insufficient to recommend it. 80% of men in the world are not circumcised.    http://www.viewofcircumcision.blogspot.c...  This blog was written by a dad faced with the decision, I thought it was very well written and factual. Feel free to read it if you want to learn more about how unnecessary circumcision is.|`|pzLDXL6gaa	I think it's wrong and shouldn't be done. I guess you haven't researched it much othewise you'd probably think that too. I was swayed by the complete lack of benefits, the ethical issues, the potential risk of serious complications, and the terrible pain.    Harriet|`|EwaPHsNSaa	I feel that every human being has the right to an intact body. I'm not against circumcision per se, there are certainly valid reasons one might choose to have a circumcision. But this is a choice that should only be made by the individual. If you have him circumcised and it turns out you are mistaken, there is no way to fix it- you have stolen the choice from him. At least if you leave him intact and you are mistaken, he still has the option to choose for himself. Why not err on the side of caution and leave his penis (and his right to choose) intact?    ~Laura|`|q1YDp1y3aa	I would recommend NOT circumcising your son. The benefits do not outweigh the risks. One analysis found that for every 9 boys who might be spared a UTI by circumcision, another 12 boys at the least (the upper estimate was 40 boys) will experience severe complications from the circumcision. Thats great if your boy is one of the 9, but horrible if he's one of the 12. UTIs can be treated by antibiotics quite effectively. Botched circumcisions are much more difficult to fix. Its also worth noting that 99% of intact boys will never get an infection, compared to 99.9% of cut boys. That means you would have to cut 100 boys to save just one of them from infection. Thats 99 boys cut for no reason at all. Out of every 1000 boys who are cut, one will contract a UTI anyway.    Only 50% of boys nationwide are circumcised. Girls of your son's generation will likely have an entirely different view of circumcision as girls from yours. Just because you think intact is "gross" and "unsanitary" does not mean the women of your son's generation will. after all, think of all the differences between you and your parents. Did you know that when your grandparents were young, circumcision was very uncommon?    Next, it is VERY painful to an infant. Most doctors still don't use any anesthesia, those that do rarely offer adequate anesthesia because the only stuff that works is not safe enough to use in infants for such a "minor" procedure. Further, some of the pain meds offered to infants aren't even recommended for use on babies! Some doctors argue that it has been done "for thousands of years" without anesthetic- what they neglect to tell you is that a medical circumcision can take over 15 minutes to complete. A Jewish ritual circumcision, by contrast, takes under 60 seconds to complete (and the baby is given wine) Here is some info on the pain.....  http://www.cirp.org/library/pain/  http://www.circumcision.org/response.htm  http://www.cirp.org/library/pain/taddio2... (note in this one that even infants offered pain meds for the procedure showed signs of post traumatic stress!)    You should also know that studies have shown that the most sensitive parts of the male anatomy of ON the foreskin- NOT the head of the penis. By cutting off the foreskin, you remove a mans most erogenous genital tissue. Here is a study about that.... (note that other studies found no difference, but they neglected to test the sensitivity of the foreskin- they only tested the glans penis of intact and cut men and didn't pay any attention to the foreskin at all) http://www.nocirc.org/touch-test/touchte...    You should know that infant boys are EASIER to care for when they are intact. The foreskin does not retract until late childhood or even puberty, so you do nothing special, just wipe the outside of his penis clean and leave it alone. Furthermore, to prevent painful and bleeding erections later in life, doctors are now commonly leaving more skin behind- in a cut boy this means you may have to push the left over skin back at every diaper change and clean beneath it to prevent it from adhering or infecting. The very thing that mother's think they avoid by circumcising! In short- Intact = wipe like a finger, NEVER retract Cut= vaseline, clean thoroughly, push back remaining skin to prevent adhesions etc (the last step perhaps for several months or years)    Here is an excellent tutorial on the basics of intact care and circumcision....  http://www.lactivistintactivist.com/?pag...    Another factor in your decision is that circumcised boys experience a 12% increase in their risk of MRSA infection. MRSA is commonly picked up in hospitals (where circumcision is performed in non-sterile conditions) and has been known to kill adults. I wouldn't want to deal with it in an infant. 12% is a BIG risk, the risk of a boy "needing" a circ later in life is WELL below that- under 1%. http://www.nocirc.org/publish/12-Answers...    The so called "benefits" of circumcision are generally trumped up. A big one now is that it "prevents" AIDS. All the studies showing "benefits" like this have been poorly designed and inconclusive. Also, for every study that finds a "benefit" there are more studies that find no benefit. http://www.icgi.org/    It is rather eye-opening to see how circumcision first became popular in the US to begin with. It was virtually unknown in this country until the 20th century. This slide show takes you through the rise of circumcision.... http://youtube.com/watch?v=f4unKTMpBGA    Finally, you should watch a video or two of the procedure so you are fully informed of what your infant will go through. I will warn you that these are graphic. If you can't handle watching them as an adult, why would you expect your infant son to endure them?  Gomco Clamp- http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=...

It's not just a western culture thing like a lot of whackos on here say it is, it's from the bible. I think it's a great idea, and so will the boy's future wife.     oh PS it's not just a Christian or Jewish thing either. It's just a healthy idea, that's why more people started practicing it.|`|P8VoBR0saa	I had both of my boys circumsized, I don't think it's wrong, it's in my opinion cleaner and nicer looking but it's really peoples opinion,|`|6988FTAYaa	i don't think its wrong i have my little boy done when he was born..ive always heard that is best for the parent to do when there born cause when they turn into growing men it could hurt them worse in the long run. i have a friend that wouldn't have it done to her sonand she said she regret not having it done!|`|aTlpDt84aa	I had my son (now 17) circumcised.  I don't think it's wrong, but don't let anyone tell you it doesn't hurt them-it does!!  But then, I know lots of people who pierce their baby's ears and that hurts them, too.  It's personal preference.|`|BVaOnbo2aa	I have had several gay male friends over the years so have heard a bit more since it's one of the topics that gets brought up among them it chat.    While there are lots of perfectly healthy adults who have had it done, circumcision does occasionally have long term problems. I have heard about when they initially did it, it looked fine. But when they grew up and entered puberty, they began having trouble or pain. Sometimes the cut wasn't even so it will pull to one side drastically more than the other causing pain. Some guys hurt so badly by the shortness of the skin that they become almost phobic about getting aroused because of the pain. This is not something that men would typically share with women or even something that straight men would offer up unless in very confidental/intimate situations with someone they could trust.      Sex can also be experienced differently for the woman. Being with man who is circumsized can cause a lot of extra friction experienced as dryness and blaming oneself for not being able to get wet enough. But having sex with an uncircumsized man will rarely result in this.     So it's a toss up. People have their religious beliefs. But I wouldn't do it just to go along with the crowd. It would have to be proven medically beneficial, and the latest studies show that the medical community no longer feels this way.|`|9TfKeq9Eaa	I had my son circumcised when he was born because I thought it was what I was "suppose to do". I didn't really educate myself on the actual procedure and the meaning and reasons behind it. It is a very personal choice and if I ever have another boy or if I could do it over again, I would NEVER have put my son through that pain. His circumcision wasn't even done properly so he still has more skin remaining then a normal circumcised penis should. If you are considering this for your own child I HIGHLY recommend you google up some information and watch a video showing the actual procedure. If you think that is something you would want done to your child then that's your decision. Just be prepared the videos can be VERY difficult to watch. I would really put some thought behind the reason you are considering this. Best of luck to you!|`|wRApV8r5aa	i don't think its wrong, however everyone has an opinion about it. i have a brother who is 10 years old and he is still not circumcised. my mom wanted to do it when he was born but my grandma stopped her because she feels bad for my little brother. honestly, i was glad that mom agreed to this because i didn't want him to go through all the pain as a little baby.     though it is a little old-fashioned, i find circumcision as a passage to manhood. when the boy reaches puberty, like at 11 or 12, i think that is the perfect time for him to have it done. undergoing something like that and getting over it will make the boy feel brave and strong, thus manlier. it will be a sense of pride (lets admit it, if i am a guy and i go through something like that and faced it as a man, i would sure be proud as hell!) and also, i think that if boys go through circumcision during puberty, they would understand it more and value the meaning behind it.     also, i have learned in school that sometimes the skin closes back again when they are circumcised as babies, which means they would have to redo the operation as older boys. also, sometimes there would be extra skin and if they do not wash the inside of the skin regularly, it would be unhygienic, thus causing bacterial infection in the penis.|`|Ws1hky6Zaa	thats up to you entirely, i had my son circumcisized just because i thought it would be cleaner.|`|XbsDGhmNaa	I had my son circumcised when he was two weeks old (he's 6 yrs. now). The doctor gave him a numbing shot first, that was the only time he cried. I don't think it's wrong.|`|OTiLeig8aa	I'm a guy and I was circumcised as a baby and have no problem with it.    I had our baby son circumcised as well.    I feel it is healthier and easier to keep clean and also feel it is good for a boy to be the same as his dad.    It does hurt them for 15 minutes, but it is not remembered.
QhVCn7rsaa	Hi. I have a 2yr old in nursery. You can contact HMRC to get Tax credits to help you out with the payments. 850 a month does sounds like a lot of money, perhaps you could try to shop around? Or have a family member take your child for 1-2 days and then the nursery bill won't be so high.    That's what i do. I saved for 2 months before putting my daughter into nursery because i had to pay a month in advance plus a month's deposit basically came to 800.    Good Luck|`|723QHuicaa	850 is extremely expensive for 1 month daycare. We have a daycare thats 125 per week. How old is the child? From age 3, you get 12 hrs daycare free, perhaps he could go back part time and contribute the extra few hours to it. Also contact HMRC, enquire about tax credits (if you dont already get them) and how much they will contribute to childcare.|`|AjqO1aJgaa	We used our own money. I'd never have had kids in the first place if we didn't have well over 1000 of savings. What are you going to do if your car dies? It'll cost you far more than that to replace.    You could ask your employer if he/she can help?

How long have you been TTC for?  Do you chart your cycle, with temperature?  Cervical Mucous is different for everybody. The more you pay attention to it within your cycles, the better you will be able to pinpoint ovulation.  Usually there are different 'types' of cervical mucous (CM) throughout the menstrual cycle.  If you start your cycle from day 1 being the 1st day of your period, AND you have a 'monthly cycle' (some have much shorter, and some much longer), then the CM will be "dry" or almost nonexistent in the days after that, then slowly increase, but also change in texture too. It becomes thick or sticky or "creamy" like moisturiser (if you touch your fingers together it will stay on each finger when you pull them apart). It becomes more watery and slippery as you approach ovulation, this is when you should be having sex as often as possible, at least every 2nd day. Just before ovulation CM is like 'eggwhite' and becomes stretchy so if you check and get some on your fingers (by just wiping before you go to the bathroom each time), then when you touch them together with CM on them and pull them apart, the CM should stay like a cheese strand, not wanting to break for a few centimetres. Unlike the moisturiser CM a week or so before.  After ovulation, your basal body temperature (BBT: resting, just upon waking, temp) increases, and your CM dries up quickly (like the day after ovulation, when chances of conceiving are back to minimal) usually until you get your period again. But some people do also get "fertile" stretchy CM after ovulation (not very usual, but possible and nothing to worry about) and it may be mistaken for an ovulating or fertile time if you are not charting other signs as well, like temperature.  If you check your signs regularly, you get to know YOUR particular signs, and you will be able to pinpoint your ovulation day to the day, which makes you able to time sex in the 5 days prior to that as well.  If you get a cheap ($10-15) BBT or ovulation thermometer (preferably digital), than this temperature changes through your cycle, along with your own CM monitoring, will pinpoint your ovulation day to the day! But you must take your temp at the same time every morning, and after at least a 3 hour block of uninterrupted sleep if possible.    Try http://www.fertilityfriend.com/  if you want to do that, or its an excellent site for info and questions too. You will find it very interesting, it will teach you alot about your body and how to TTC with the best of chances...  Good luck!

u0mZAPuDaa	You could try the two day method.    When you have a couple of days to work with him. The first day take him to the bathroom every 30 minutes, not longer than that. The second day, do so every hour.     He gets a little sticker for sitting on the potty and trying. The sticker can go in his sticker book or on a chart. He gets a 'big' sticker for actually using the potty!    Also, take him to the store and let him pick out his 'big boy' underwear, whichever ones he wants! You explain to him these are 'big boy' underwear and big boys potty in the toilet. If he wants to wear his cool underpants, he has to use the potty!    I have to say, if the child is old enough to know when he has to go potty and knows when he is going potty, he has all the requirements for potty training.     There are some many women who say he will get it when he 'ready'. We don't expect our children to 'get' anything else in life, when they are 'ready'. We teach them, we guide them, we lead my example and we discipline them. If he knows he needs to potty in the toilet and chooses to do other, he is disobeying you. I think there comes a time when some discipline needs to come in to play. I know there will be thumbs down, but I can guarantee every single person would have something to say about a four year old wearing diapers!

Don't talk about it, don't push him, don't ask him if he needs to use the bathroom. He is not ready. And he probably likes the attention he gets to use the toilet.   What I did for my son when he turned 4 and still would not use the toilet is to set up the diapers and wipes and a garbage pail where he could reach them and calmly told him I would no longer change his diapers. He could continue wearing them and using them to pee and poop in, but I would not change them.   I made sure we had quality time together and lots of positive attention for other things like helping me cook or going to the park or zoo which were his favorite things to do. I did not make a big deal out of changing diapers for his little sisters and praised him if he helped me change "the babies". It took about a month of his changing his own diaper- and then he decided to go on the potty because diapers were- in his own word- gross!|`|c8231f1c2871ecc3f6adf7b7e74dde8baa	Try getting his dad or some male figure to help him...and don't feel too bad It's very difficult to potty train lil boys...I have a newphew that is turning 2 this week and he too is very smart with everything but potty training is somehow difficult for him... he can tell you what he did in his diper and tell you that he needs to be change...I have tried to potty train him myself but I don't have a potty at my house so I try to  hold him while he "goes" on the toilet and it works but he is very scared of the "big" potty lolz so he won't go alone    Good Luck|`|PSaXvIyWaa	Boys seems to be trickier at potty training. A few ideas are to make a sticker chart and everytime he goes potty he gets a sticker . When he fills up a row he gets to pick out a new toy from the "treasure chest" (like a toy from McD's, nothing big) This one worked for my daughter though  Also, for my son, I took him to the potty every hour whether he had to go or not. It may also help if you get a portable potty that you leave in the living room or wherever you are most of the day. One of the biggest things that helped me with my son was to have daddy take hime potty and show him. He also got a kick out of knowing how much he was like daddy and he thought he was the biggest boy on the block  Good luck and don't stress kids don't where diapers forever, he will get there when he is ready|`|es6l59Unaa	First off get rid of the diapers.. put him on cute underwear that he picks out. Only use pull ups to go to bed... Dont give him anything to drink a fewhours prior to bed time. Buy him the elmo potty traing video( my friend brought it by) my daughter was already potty trained but i seen how interested she was in this show.  ( she always wanted to go potty)  Put your son on the frequently, no matter how much he does not want to be there ( i have a cousin who peed his self until 11, seriously) his parents did not care! When he does the potty, make a big deal and clap and say yay and scream "your a big boy" kids love to make their parents happy.. repeat this everyday and remember THROW AWAY THOSE DIAPERS!  Good luck, and remember it takes time and just be patient.|`|F4xIEr1daa	This sounds just like my (now) 4 yr old boy.  He was about 3 and 1/2 when he was potty trained too, and we tried everything also.  Nothing worked- but what was interesting is we switched schools and he just started doing it one day.  I think his old school was being to harsh on him about it, and making him feel bad and embarresed about it.  So, just relax, and be positive and don't be on him about it all the time, and it will just happen.|`|NVME5dAKaa	Ok, seriously...try this. Take a container and put some fruit loops or Cheerios (any small cereal really) and when you take him to potty, put 2 or 3 in the toilet. Next, tell him to try and hit the cereal with his pee and sink them...lol I'm telling you, we did this with my nephew and it worked. Might be a little strange at first but you never know...it just might work for you!|`|FQrl1Azbaa	my son was similar. good at reading, writing, drawing and sitting in his own mess...    can you get him into a daycare for a couple of days a week? so he is around other kids who toilet properly.     peer pressure is quite useful at that age!|`|Hp8JPP8Baa	Here's some things, which I have had success.(former nanny)   !. Yes, good to have Daddy and big boy go together! Good bonding! (Monkey see monkey do!).  2. Cheerio game boys love shooting at things. Ready aim fire! Sink the O's!  3. Also, for dry nights. Yes, limit fluids after dinner!  Then potty before  bedtime 8:00- 9:00. Then once the child is sound asleep, say 11:00-11:30 when you're heading to bed, take the semi-sleeping child off to the potty! (Helps, if it's not glaring lights, so use a little night light in the bathroom when you take them)Their bladder will be empty all night! They'll fall back to sleep without even remembering they were up! But, this will prepare them for getting up themselves for night time trips in the future!   Good Luck! He will train. Before you know it, he'll be asking for the car keys! So, enjoy all the stages as they happen! : )|`|qzY6TuQmaa	my son is 2 and is doing very well my son is also a drinker so a lil bit after i would sit him on the potty if he peed i would say how much of a big boy he is (now he fav words) or i wouldn't give him another drink until he peed in the potty.|`|sJE6FS1raa	Boys want to imitate dad. Have his father bring him into the bathroom whenever he has to go so he can watch how daddy uses the toilet. Once he sees that he can pee standing up, his dad can pee with him and play a game of hitting a target such as a piece of toilet paper or fruit loops. This makes it fun for him to use the toilet and he can work on his aim. Be sure to use positive  reinforcement and reward him with a special treat or a video when he uses the toilet.|`|UinOWcMUaa	Easy fix.. I mean many ways to help out with this situation, but just let him do his own thing for now.. it's his 1st real big adventure. How my son became potty trained at 1 1/2 years of age (which by the way is better than alot of little girls) is that I sat him on the toilet until he went, cried alot but got the ideal rather fast. That or he was sitting for awhile..  anyways.. different strokes for different folks, but maybe even try the sticker program or give him one of his favorite toys as a reward...anyways.. keep you head up.. and before too long, you will wish he was back in diapers...        Blessings|`|OHfZFR31aa	It's surprising that peer pressure at school hasn't had an effect. My friend's daughter, who I watch a lot, wouldn't potty train. But when she went to pre-school, she was the only kid still in diapers and the other kids teased her and called her a baby, so she took off her diapers and started using the toilet within a week.    Get rid of the diapers and put him in big boy pants. Let him feel what it's like to be wet and uncomfortable. Let him pick out whichever pants he wants, but tell him that if he doesn't use the toilet, he can't wear those pants because Spongebob, Spiderman, whoever doesn't like to be peed on.
CH0QX4g6aa	In the ovary, hormones secreted by the largest follicle will cause others to regress. In the first week of the cycle the maturation of the oocyte in its associated follicle depends on the progress of the maturation of the surrounding follicle cells. The fittest follicle with its oocyte becomes the dominant follicle in the second cycle week and, later, a graafian follicle   Roughly a week before the midpoint of the menstrual cycle the dominant follicle develops in one of the two ovaries. This grows faster than the other tertiary follicles and prepares itself for ovulation. It reaches a diameter of up to 25 mm and is also known then as the graafian follicle.  Stimulated by gradually increasing amounts of estrogen in the follicular phase, the lining of the uterus thickens. Follicles in the ovary begin developing under the influence of a complex interplay of hormones, and after several days one or occasionally two become dominant (non-dominant follicles atrophy and die). The dominant follicle releases an ovum, or egg, in an event called ovulation. After ovulation, the remains of the dominant follicle in the ovary become a corpus luteum cyst; this cyst has a primary function of producing large amounts of progesterone to maintain a pregnancy. If no conception occurs the body will shed the lining of the uters and the cyst. (this is why you have a period) If conception does occur, the cyst will remain and receive HCG from the embryo. (this is why you don not have a period when you are pregnant bc your body is shedding nothing) So the dominant follicle is a good thing. You need one to ovulate.    However...    A uterine septum is a form of a congenital malformation where the uterine cavity is partitioned by a longitudinal septum; the outside of the uterus has a normal typical shape. The wedge-like partition may involve only the superior part of the cavity resulting in an incomplete septum or a subseptate uterus, or less frequently the total length of the cavity (complete septum) and the cervix resulting in a double cervix. The septation may also continue caudally into the vagina resulting in a "double vagina".    A septum can be resected with surgery. Hysteroscopic removal of a uterine septum is generally the preferred method as the intervention is relatively minor and safe in experienced hands. A follow-up imaging study should demonstrate the removal of the lesion.    A septum that has not caused problems may not be removed. There is controversy whether a septum should be removed prophylactically prior to a pregnancy or infertility treatment    They are sending you for the MRI to check the severity of the septum.|`|2HETgiwgaa	Dominant just refers to the fact that of the several follicles that are developing, that one is the biggest - the dominant one.  Normally, the others recede (stop developing) and just the dominant one releases an egg when you ovulate.  Mature follicles can range from 18 to 30mm (1.8 to 3cm) so at 2,4cm its close to maturing.  Since you can get pregnant at any time in your cycle, I'd guess you can still ovulate (release an egg) from that follicle.  BABY DUST|`|IqOaDmBbaa	Its my understanding that a follicle that's as big as you say yours is in considered a mature one, meaning that it is ready to travel and meet up with sperm. if it doesn't it will follow the normal wrought and you wil have a period.    If your working with a fertility doc to get preg they usually give you whats called a trigger shot to get the follicle to start its journey.
VS78dqO9aa	This was my little girl's!!!  i absolutely loved it! It's not very much princess, but it was cute!

Those first few months I didn't do much at all   My parents were told, Enjoy this time while she is small.     Once I discovered I could scoot around by my own might,   Its been non-stop action morning till night.     At 4? months, my first tooth finally broke through,   And it did not put me in a good mood.     On May 24th, I took off crawling across the floor,   With in a few weeks I was pulling up and finally off all fours.     The first time I tried putting one foot in front of the other,   I was 10 months old, and I walked to my mother.     I practiced walking all day and into the night,   And by October 23rd I had at last got it right!     Ma-Ma, Doggie, & Duck are words I now can say,   But Daddy is what you will hear most of the day.     As you can see Ive had a busy year   Hard to believe my 1st birthday is already here.|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	Princess Autum, you so awesome  You make dad happy when you crappy  Now you sleep we buy pony  Got to work and earn dat money|`|20NZn1YZaa	1)Please accept this invite  For an afternoon of fun  Join Autumn in her castle  For today's she turning one  We hope to see you promptly  On this very special day  To join our little Princess  For an afternoon of play    2)Autumn's turning one today  We hope you'll come along  To join our little Princess  In A Happy Birthday Song  We hope to see your faces   On this very special day  An afternoon of goodies  And of course a lot of play    I wrote these off the top of my head.

nic8GvOaaa	All the stress she is under could be making her period late. visit babycenter.com they have information which could help you. If it would help clam your mind go buy her a test.|`|kQC4HX6vaa	If you guys can't be "grown up" about this and stop worrying about how the "he feels/she feels teenage drama"...maybe you aren't ready to handle the seriousness of a sexual relationship.    That's my help and harsh advice for you.    Sex is not a game nor a pleasure if you're constantly worried about "what happens" when you damn well know PREGNANCY is the only result.|`|P9HPKKxzaa	just go to a clinic. Planned Parenthood. It safe and surest way to find out.|`|qqm78P2Saa	First of all, stress and anxiety will make your period come super late, trust me! I think all girls have had a scare like this and the stress doesn't help the situation.    The first few signs I had were constantly being tired, severe mood swings, cramping and back pain, fatigue, and nausea. Those are the most popular symptoms.    My advice would be to go to Planned Parenthood if you have one nearby. They do free pregnancy testing. If you cannot find one close by, google free pregnancy centers in your nearby town. You can get tested by professionals and checked out by doctors and/or nurse practitioners. The sooner you get this checked, the better it will be for all!    Hope all goes well!|`|LLQ8Kz24aa	u bring any pregnecy kit and test it. if both line r red than u pregnet.
AA11434640	If she found out she was pregnant on the 23rd, then logically you'd have to be the father. See, she couldn't have gotten pregnant by the other guy on the 20th and have already known about it by the 23rd. Actually, she was probably pregnant when she had sex with him.    Hope this makes sense :)|`|6L9jJnchaa	It doesn't matter if he came or not, precum could have still gotten her pregnant.  You're not going to be able to know for sure until you get a DNA test.  She slept with the two of you too close together to figure it out any other way.    Good luck!|`|AA11763588	It's probably yours... the only way you will know 100% is a DNA test.|`|d7769329bd0a2936e9a45b35adc6db88aa	get a paternity test|`|jNqf8HtDaa	girls start the pregnancy thing 2 weeks before you even have sex so you most likely are the daddy congrates but you can get a test done so you always have that to really count on     im sorry you have to go through that     best of luck|`|4lpJRXYsaa	i would say you very well can be the father, if her due date is March 23rd then she conceived on or around June 16th, which would mean if you had sex on June 15th and 17th then you 2 can sex when she was ovulating and thats when she got pregnant|`|uLeXGHnKaa	It's always possible that the other guy is the father, even if he didn't *** precum is really potent, but it's more likely that you are since you had sex and your sperm came in contact with her much more frequently. The only way to know for sure is a paternity test though, since the episodes were so close together.|`|nic8GvOaaa	Yes you could, its highly likely you are. But if it would make you feel better i would tell her that it would put your mind to rest if you did a test to see if its really yours she should be able to understand that. Best of luck i hope the baby is yours you sound like a good guy|`|Y7sio6Yhaa	i'm sorry but the only way to be positive is a test after the baby's born. whether he came in her or not doesnt mean it cant be his, pre ejaculation is always present and it only takes once. i have a feeling u know that or u wouldn't be asking this question. but there's nothing anybody can tell you except get a test, it's a horrible situation but that's all i can say.|`|6988FTAYaa	more than likely your the father to this little girl for you sake i hope and pray that it is since your been reasonable for this!!cause with her ex been drunk i dont think he has  and chance of been the daddy cause like you said your always cumming in here and the dates just dont match up with him!!good luck and god bless hope it works for the best of you!|`|vaBVFsY3aa	I made a sum, and if you were the only person she had sex with during that time, you are the father. But you were not...... The time that you had sex is the time for the due date.  I still think you should get a DNA test done after the pregnancy. I don't know what happened between the two of you, but please speak to her about this test after the delivery. It might upset her now.    Good luck for the both of you.|`|y5sWmbtnaa	I am sure that the child is yours if you think that she is yours whether genetically or not. Just don't worry about it ok? relax and be the father you would want to have either way.|`|wKuQC4yTaa	she most likely conceived around the 15th of june|`|BVaOnbo2aa	Sadly, I've seen this situation more than once for guys.    If you really have feelings for her AND it seems like a relationship that could be long term, then it may be worth it for you to consider what if the child *isn't* yours. How much of a difference will that make?    One couple I'm aware of, two blonds blue-eyed, were waiting on their baby to be born, and the little boy came out with midnight black hair. He knew it was impossible for it to have been his child, but he decided to be the father anyway.    This happened to a married couple I knew as well. It wasn't his baby.. tehy were going through problems and were seperated at the time. They got back together and he took on the role of father, but they did eventually divorce--she couldn't/wouldn't stop cheating. And then she moved out of state with the kids while he still pays child support. He got the short end in several ways. He's emotionally attached and rarely has the chance to see them. It really sucks.    Whatever you decide, just know there isn't any right or wrong answer. Only what's right for you... and even that can be rather gray.|`|es6l59Unaa	Im gonna say that you are. You can always get a dna test BUT i sure hope you are the father since it sounds like you wanna be that babies father so bad. Good luck and still be there, so that if you are the dad you will not have missed any part of the babies life     Im wishing you the best|`|xVs6vFhXaa	you ARE the father. haha ;)
8IIVBPwkaa	Yes, you could be pregnant, although it is hard to say - you don't mention whether you were using any form of birth control. Best thing to do would be to take another test today. If it comes back negative, maybe pay a visit to your doctor so they can find out if something else is wrong.   Good luck!|`|e8NNgTRFaa	I think that you should go to the doctor. Many girls get false negatives and if you havent had you period since december then you should get checked. The doctor can give you a blood test and an oultra sound you never can be sure but see a doctor right away you could be pregnant and then it could be that you body is changing on you. Well hope that helps!!|`|0QbAiQwhaa	I reckon in about a few more days you may get your period... if not hen I suggest you take another pregnancy test, if its still negative then honestly see a GP or doctor and talk to them about all the symptoms, you may have something else than prgnancy|`|DITBVWjPaa	I don't know your situation. If you are particularly stressed out..or had a significant change in your weight...they are all factors in receiving late periods...even spontaneous bleeding ..if you are still worried..go to your DR and get a real test for your piece of mind.|`|Ddb5821Jaa	Sometimes those tests are not sensitive enough. I would check with your doctor. Also, it could a very late and light period you just experienced, OR implantation. I would see a doctor if you keep getting sore boobs (which was a telltale sign for most women) and until you know for sure, eat good, get exercise and read up!|`|KoSfHeRGaa	Yes.  you can have a false negative.. but never a false positive.  if your period doesnt start here soon, i'd get a blood test done  blood test are always right...    && usually when i first start my period for that month i have brown discharge/blood.. THEN a couple days later i actually start bleeding..    either way though. id go to the doc ASAP.    goodluck!
DuLhv7Ajaa	My son was and is in the 100th percentile and my daughter was in the 97th percentile. This sound totally normal to me! LOL   Their doctor had me putting rice cereal in their bottles from the time they were two months old. Neither were or are fat, just very tall. Maybe you should try cereal in her bottle before she goes to sleep, it may help keep her tummy full through the night.  Max age 6, wears size 10  Ava age 5 wears size 8  Jack age 2 wears size 4T  No ballerinas in this family!!! LOL|`|u0mZAPuDaa	My daughter is nine months also.    At her nine month check up she was 19.1 pounds and 30'' long. 27lbs seems like a whole lot more! If she is 27lbs, you would think the opposite, she wouldn't need that bottle in the night! She's a big girl!    My daughter is asleep between 9:30p and 10p each night; she wakes anywhere between 10am and 11am. She doesn't wake anymore for any feedings.    She used to wake in the beginning of sleeping upstairs. Well, around five months there would be nights she would sleep the whole night and some night she would wake up. If she woke up I always offered a bottle. I read in that book, 'What to Expect The First Year' that sometimes babies wake for a 'feeding' out of habit.    They said one way to break this habit is to slowly dilute the bottle, making it more water with each night. The baby will realize it is just water and not want to wake for that.     You have to consider growth spurts too though, they last two to three days. There will be a couple of those to take into consideration.    I didn't dilute the bottle, instead I would just go in to her room and rock her. I would comfort her back to sleep. After three nights of this she slept all night through and hasn't woke in the night again.    Each baby is different though.    Good Luck!|`|uLGqDh47aa	sounds like she's just growing and needing a little fill up in her tummy. You might could try putting a little baby rice in the formula to see if she'll completely sleep thru the ngiht then.|`|vsKrGw2caa	sound good|`|XeTkAtXaaa	wow that's great only onces a nigh. lucky!  yes its normal my son did the same he was also a big baby in the 90%  and he would sleep until 9 or so. relax what he is doing is perfectly normal. soon he will start sleeping trough the night but might wake up earlier.|`|q4yfbhODaa	My eight month old did the same thing, but his was at 2:00 am. I started to give him a bowl of oatmeal before bed time then a small bottle to wash it down and help him fall asleep. He sleeps all night long now. My son is also a big boy, he is in the 90th percentile for his age group.|`|waU776uwaa	My 9 month old boy weighs 21.6 pounds and wakes up about 2-3 times for feedings. He goes to sleep between 9-10pm. Yesterday he slept from 9pm until 7 this morning. So I'm hoping he keeps it up.
AA11763588	When is your period due?     Don't bother taking a test till you miss your period. You will just get your hopes down and waste your money.    Keep in mind that when women are TTC they will tend to find symptoms that they don't have or had when they are going to get their periods, but didn't really notice.    Good Luck.|`|nic8GvOaaa	I would say wait till you are meant to be getting your period and then take the test.|`|GLQL2IEaaa	TAKE THE TEST FUTURE BABY MAMMA!|`|AzdAvDW1aa	until u have to pee|`|wKuQC4yTaa	to make sure its accurate. I would wait to take the HPT on February 10th at the earliest.|`|82ORY9UFaa	Since you are planing on having a baby, you could wait until you miss  your period + a couple days. Don't waste money and hope on a test.    When you really want a kid and fall pregnant, you can feel it, even if all the symptomes arent showing.    Good luck on the baby !|`|pRnhVmDCaa	You could take a pregnancy test right now, but the result will almost be completely accurate after two weeks so for you sometime next week.  Also, first response is the most accurate test I've come across, some of the others are hard to tell what the answer is or have even given false readings.  Congratulations and Good Luck!!!|`|DXtyMRLuaa	Hey girl, It seems we are in a similar situation. I have been having the same symptoms as you mentioned and been really anxious to test ( this will be  1 for my husband and I ). The test say you can test like 10 days past ovulation, which I did today with a negative result.I am still like a week before my period is due so I am going to retest again closer to the date, hopefully with more of a result that will put this in place with my feelings. Good luck, and baby dust!
1CryEnb3aa	Headaches are totally normal in pregnancy.  Your heart is now working over time for you and the baby.  So, it can cause the vessels to dilate and cause headaches.  I normally get migraines due to my monthly period, while pregnant they go away the entire time.  I love that.  I also had more discharge during my early pregnancy and then towards the end had to wear pantie liners because I kept leaking pee!  So gross I know.  Can't help it though the baby was pushing on my bladder!  Just let your dr know of your headaches so they can document it in your chart.  Good luck and congrats!|`|2HETgiwgaa	It's been a while since I've been pregnant - but I'm pretty sure I didn't get headaches - could be a symptom for you though, I've heard of people having similar symptoms.  I wasn't following my cycle at the time, but I do remember the reason I tested is that it dawned on me it had been a few days since my normal premenstrual symptoms - cramping mainly  - and they'd gone away again.  So my early symptoms were just that - then of course morning sickness kicked in at a few weeks (5 or 6).  Everyone's experience of pregnancy is unique to them, I think :-) Good luck and BABY DUST    Edit:  Oops - maybe should've said congrats - Didn't click you could be saying you're already pregnant :-)  Either way - take care
jS6Qkj0faa	ok first things first is that you need to rest when bubby rests- dont worry about the housework, it will still be there later. When baby rests lie down and put your feet up too. You will hear him when he wakes up and all parents have better coping skills when they arent exhausted. During the day when he wakes take him outside and play and talk with him. when he wakes at night keep the lights low and give him cuddles but try not to stimulate him heaps. He will soon learn night from day- remember though that its always the same in utero and thats what hes used to. Babies dont DO schedules- they just go with the flow and it will be a lot easier for you too if you can too. When babies are little they need to wake frequently and feed and be changed and just cuddled and loved- its a massive adaption for him being out of your tummy and he needs time to getused to it. Take care of yourself too and make sure you get plenty of rest and eat well.|`|pwu9xzF8aa	babies  clocks work backwards- well, a lot of them do anyway.took my daughter about a week and a half to sleep at night- she would sleep through the day and then be awake most of the night.  Which stressed me out like nothing else!!  but u just have to hang in there! it will happen soon!!  congrats on your little one|`|2d4bf519052c116a45ae533ba6db1671aa	it sounds like he has his days  and night  turn back wards but thats normel lol  try to keep  him awake longer in  the day time lol happy mother hood lol|`|uLGqDh47aa	lol. I dont think it's possible to put a newborn on a schedule. When they are that small they're going to wake up and go to sleep as they please, it'll take him a little time to learn day from night and get into a routine. Just be patient for now. Best advice....try to rest when he is resting. Thats the best way to get sleep right now.|`|BVaOnbo2aa	Maybe it's the equivalent of jet lag. lol He hasn't been exposed to light before (which is what triggers the human sleep/wake cycle.)    He'll naturally be waking for feedings and changing every two hours to begin with anyway. Welcome to the world of newborns! :-)|`|692c8795f68a0ba95a0d09139d70c98caa	Most newborns are backwards for a few weeks.  You cant make him sleep longer at night or alter his schedule, they sleep when they want.. its impossible to keep a tired newborn up as well.  Dont worry it gets easier!  My baby is 12 weeks and just now started sleeping more then 2 hours at a time at night.. ugh.  She goes 4 hours now!  Lol|`|732c8aa6cd004765b25dffe2c773041eaa	LOL thats the FIRST thing I was told when i had my son, their clocks are literally backwards - he will adjust to your schedule within a month or so (he wont sleep thru the whole night) but he'll be less sleepy during the day and sleep more at night.  All the books told me to "sleep when he sleeps" and that worked for me for about a month.  Good Luck, God Bless and Congratulations.|`|c20207b79edb6a1d68e27d7750bd7d9caa	ur new baby probably wont start to get on any kinda schedule until he is 2-3 months old. when isabel was a new born, she woke up every time at 1am 3am and 6am it was horrible! but you will get through it! its just a phase that wont last long.... now shes 4 months old and sleeps through the night. it goes fast|`|wCbrbMqoaa	This is completely normal and exactly why most new moms are so sleep deprived.  Newborns usually always have their days and nights mixed up but they need their sleep to grow and be healthy so its not really possible to get them on a schedule for a couple months.  He will get used to his new environment soon. In the mean time you just have to wait it out.  Good luck to you:)
6cN8aLnaaa	It's your body, your baby, but consider the fact that even if you and your x broke up this baby is still a part of you. Are you really willing to kill a part of yourself. If you are then go through with the abortion. If not, which is what I suggest, then talk to your parents and take the necessary steps to get prenatal care to make sure you and your baby are as healthy as possible. Pregnancy and parenting is difficult but it is so rewarding and worth it.|`|HvZNhd4waa	think hard, there are lots of good ppl who would love u 4 ever , if you gave the baby to  them,,  but depends on what state you live in, First  gp to planed parent hood...  i live in las vegas, and have had it done,     first one i was 15, and 11 months  yes it hurt, but my mom never had to know, my boyfreind took me and he payed 4 it,, 3 hun ,, bucks  now i am 30 years older.. and have 2 wounderfull boys been marred 22 years  so if you are going to get it done ,, DO NOT WATE  OVER 14 WEEKS good luck,|`|5f6XnInEaa	Don' worry, if your too cheap to pay for your own ignorance, the tax-payers will do it for you.    Planned parenthood offers this service.|`|OwLcbnTvaa	If you want to get an abortion, i would go to your local G.P over here anyway i think it costs money at the doctors.  And if you go to like a family clinic etc they usually do them for free.  You have to go through counselling before you go through with this because many ladies think they can handle it but they cant. This is provided before abortion over here.In New zealand. So think wisely.   :) goodluck|`|uhj76Fkpaa	yes,it costs a babys life|`|4b763bad020f3ed283fdcd243915642faa	yea money, you should give this tremendous though once its done its forever if possible in your situation you could always give the baby up    ultimately the decision is yours|`|Y7sio6Yhaa	to answer your question yes it could cost anywhere between 300-600 dollars, the price actually differs for everyone although i remember getting really mad because the first lady i spoke to at planned parenthoold didnt tell me this so just to be safe i got 600 which was the most it could be and took that with me to the clinic. turns out i couldn't do it and ended up getting a panic attack at the clinic and realized i wanted to keep my baby i couldnt do it so i left. but i completely understand considering it so dont let these stupid people put u down, everybody needs to make their own decision. and usually when u first find out you're pregnant and it wasn't a planned pregnancy that's the first reaction but if i were you, and since i've been there, i would give yourself some time to think about it especially since you've already passed the 9 week deadline for the medical abortion, now you're only abortion option is the surgical one and that's gotta be a lot harder to go through with. and i kinda have more issue with it since it literally is just them putting this metal rod up there and ripping the baby and pregnancy out of your body. there' s just something that doesn't seem right about it, but if that's your decision i can't do anything about it. i dont know how old you are but it sounds like you're younger than 17, i'm 20 and i know i was freaked out. but it's not impossible to have a baby, and be a mother whatever age you are. and as much as you're thinking it will ruin your life, that you're too young, this is your chance to be an adult no matter wat age you are and do the right thing. you WILL always wonder wat if, if you terminate this baby. and it's not an easy way out, it's not easy there's a lot of pain involved and depression that will most likely follow so just think about it. but if your tests were positive then youre pregnant so just think about it.|`|jhgKFJJzaa	like another person says  it costs the babys' life  no offense but if u ad sex and new u could get pregnant y didnt u take precautions|`|285c8243564acc36040f290206c3ff28aa	Go to Planned Parenthood.  They may have a fund for women who can't afford abortions.  Abortion in any case is a lot cheaper than pregnancy.  You can get the guy to pay for it, too, since I'm sure he knows that having a child is expensive.    Next time, use condoms.  They're also cheaper than pregnancy.
TolGczKOaa	My first baby was 8 lbs. 13 oz.  My second was 11 pounds 1 oz!  But the third was 8 lbs. 10 oz, so I don't think order really has anything to do with it.    Also, even though my second child was so big, the delivery (vaginal) was actually easier than the first.  Good luck!|`|AA10289917	Yes.  I had not heard about it being a common thing though.  The stitches were about all I remember, same as yours.  But, it wasn't so bad that I was afraid of having more babies.  Just go with the flow.  It is all you can do.  Don't think about it.  Take care of your first baby and just do what you need to prepare.  You know a lot more now than you did with your first!  I wish you a healthy baby and that you will get through this without trauma or bad memories.  You need to trust your dr and pray for God's blessing on the lives of your family.|`|WzKrZoHQaa	first girl arrived 7lb 9oz,  second baby was boy arrived 8lb 10z and third baby another girl weighed in at 8lb 4oz.  I had C sections for all 3 whilst awake and NO I don't feel cheated of anything thanks :)|`|fynzkVK4aa	My 2nd was the smallest of all 3 of my children at birth.  If you are worrying over this I suggest you ask at your scans as they can usually give you a pretty good "guesstimate" of how big baby will be on delivery, and this would allow you to consider your options if it turns out they think baby will be bigger than your last child.    Best of luck.|`|nwWBddEnaa	better bigger than been tiny, my daughter was born 4lbs 11 Oz's and im 19 weeks with  2 and have been told that this one won't be any bigger i would rather  2 was bigger because we had such a hard time with my daughter bigger is sometimes better, i wish you luck x|`|6AKKwrujaa	my first was 8lb 4oz a girl, i had a cut and third degree tear so had a fair few stitches too, i couldn't sit down properly for few weeks after and was really uncomfortable.   Then my second only 15 months later was a boy 8lb 11oz, i had a water birth, much much nicer and relaxing, still had a tear but only 2nd degree so the stitches and the pain was nowhere near as bad, and felt completely normal after just two days, that was just over 8 weeks ago. ohh and my bump was a lot smaller for my son!?!    good luck and hope your as lucky as i was with your second, as long as your in the right frame of mind you will be fine, just believe in yourself that you can do it and when the baby is here it will be worth it xx|`|42dafba9ff7361d27a14115d9d33feedaa	My  second was a boy and 8ozs lighter than his sister|`|3cdb0Tmraa	No they are not always bigger weather it's a boy or girl or first or second. Each individual baby is different and that is all there is to it. Just see how he sizes up as you go in comp to your daughters weight givin to you by the doc as she grew in you and you can decide what to do from there. In fact most people find no2 for less difficult than the first!  Wishing you an easy delivery.. :)|`|4ywNkfqEaa	My friend just had her 2nd baby -a baby boy and he is smaller than her 1st baby who is a girl. so dont take it for granted that ur 2nd baby or a baby boy will be bigger than a girl. good luck|`|zXPJ38eJaa	my first was 6lb15oz and second was 7lb15oz so as a general rule I would say it is true but everyone is different. I think your healthcare profs will monitor the size tho cos my friend was induced early because the baby was getting too big.|`|547cda86a737eee48c045921b9b5afa1aa	it s not always the case as my first was big and the next 3 were all smaller|`|FCFdYuchaa	confirm  http://pregnancy-parenting-guide.blogspo...|`|jNqf8HtDaa	its not true but can happen and it might so just plan on having about the same size|`|r7q8LW7Aaa	That's a bit of a rule of thumb, it's not always true. My first was 7lb 6 and my second was 8lb 2, so it was true for me, but my mum had 6 kids and she had her heaviest first and then they all got smaller!  However, even with a bigger baby, my second labour was about a tenth as hard as my first. It was waayyyyy faster. My midwife said the general rule (of thumb again) is that your second labour is about half the time. Mine was about a sixth of the time.|`|1c498d03fe9bb2e8719c81fe361b9912aa	Ive always heard that boys weigh less than girls, my midwife told me that, my first my son was 6lbs14 and a half ounces and my 2nd my daughter was 7lbs 15 and a half ounces,  if your worried ask your midwife how much she thinks he will weigh, i asked mine when pregnant with my daughter and she said 8lbs so she wasn't far off lo.l good luck|`|xZT3SMUgaa	hey sweetie,  My first son was 9lbs..and i am now expecting my daughter in may. I too was concerned about the same as you, and i spoke with my midwife. She said that if your first baby was bigger than the average baby-and the average is 7lb5 ish...then the chances are that the second baby wil be smaller. So i hope this puts your mind at rest.Thats what im holding n to anyway.  but again, its not something that we can be sure of...tho your midwife should be able to give you more of an idea nearer the time.  good luck x|`|K1M2ujKbaa	I have 2 sons. My first 8'2 my 2nd 9'4. In my case it was true but with the first I had to have a C-section and then had a VBAC. They both ripped me a new one. Everyone I have talked to seems to follow that pattern of having a bigger 2nd child. So, yikes I will pray for your vagina:)
2HETgiwgaa	If you mean you're not ovulating - that may be able to be treated.  You should talk to your doctor.  A woman has all the eggs she'll ever have when she is born and they're gone by menopause.  If you weren't born with any, the doctors can't help you develop them - but you can still use an egg donor.  Good luck :-)|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	You'll need to go see your doctor. Ask him/her to recommend a fertility specialist. You will need an egg donor and then get IVF most likely.|`|E9F6qjRWaa	yes there is a lab but you need to ask a doctor to recommend you and by the way this will cost a but load of money

u0mZAPuDaa	If the first day of your last period was on the 14th, you would have ovulated around the 28th of January, that would have been about the day you would have conceived.     If you 'conceived' on the 28th of January, you would have had implantation somewhere around yesterday.    If implantation only occurred yesterday, you wouldn't yet have any of these symptoms.    You period will come soon.    I wish women knew their bodies a bit more.|`|jNqf8HtDaa	i would see your doctor because if you are pregnant they can help and give you something to help you not feel so crappy|`|Ssv6UqmJaa	It hasn't been quite a full month since  your last period and that's probably why the pregnancy test is saying it's negative. You seem to be having majority of the pregnancy signs. Wait until it's been a month, and take another home pregnancy test and if it still comes out negative go to the doctor.|`|y5sWmbtnaa	heart burn takes a long time to start in most pregnancies.|`|nic8GvOaaa	Go to the doctor and have them to a test, also if your looking online and getting information from there it could make you think your pregnant when it could be something else so its always best to visit your doctor first best of luck|`|vUr2GX4iaa	Well, if you are pregnant, you would only be 3 weeks pregnant.  Usually, you would conceive about 14 days from your last menstrual period meaning your fertile window would have been from January 24-February 3.  So most likely you are not pregnant or it is too soon to track the pregnancy hormone in your urine.    BUT that is only the norm.  You could be different.  I know the waiting games sucks, but take a HPT when you are due for your period.  If it comes out negative and you still feel pregnant, take another one a few days later or just go to your doctor and he/she can give you a blood test.  Good luck!      BTW if you are preggers, you'd be due on my birthday.  October 22.  LOL!
LKIhUMCgaa	lol red cheeks r ok, it's actually a good thing whether u're pregnant or not, it's considered to be a sign of u being healthy, u got a good blood flow throughout ur body, which is why they're red. hot flashes r also normal when u're pregnant.|`|75oU12V3aa	It is quite normal, due to the hormones in your system, and at a later stage in your pregnancy (I don't know how far you are) due to the excess fluid you're carrying around in the form of amniotic fluid, but mainly your baby's own blood supply.    Enjoy it, that's what they call the "pregnancy glow". It's great :-D|`|6cN8aLnaaa	It's normal as far as I know. Another wonderful side effect of those hormones. My cheeks would get really red, but I was having hot flashes with them.|`|uhBkbgoaaa	YOU'RE GLOWING WITH RED CHEEKS SHOULDNT BE BAD.

u0mZAPuDaa	Well, I wouldn't say you are a bad mother because she got a hold of a pen lid. It is a minor issue and will be handled.    However, I am wondering why you are on Yahoo Answers and not at the hospital with your baby? I am hoping you are using wireless in her room.|`|pJiTbIpYaa	No Honey you are not terrible. It is a mistake any mother would make. My daughter tries to swallow stuff all the time. All the best with your little one. I am sure she will be fine.|`|YmEGCGtnaa	oh im so sorry. no you're not a terrible mom, it's not your fault, accidents happen and babies have a way of getting into things.  Is she okay? I hope she gets well quick! I'm sure the docs will be sure she is fine. Good thing you took her.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	Things happen. Just pray!

Accidents happen, and babies manage to get their hands on things you'd never think possible. I have all my medicine and dangerous household products locked up. And my son STILL managed to get a whole packet of paracetamol from a closed container... to this day I still don't know how he did it!    Get on your hands and knees (so you're baby 'floor level') and see what she sees... that way you can remove anything dangerous. That's about the best you can do.     Don't beat yourself up. They get into everything, and accidents happen ALL the time. Just wait until she can walk, and you'll see.|`|5f6XnInEaa	No, but vacuuming and keeping your house tidy will avoid things like this in the future.    I assume this is fake, because you say "Rushed to the hospital last night at 6 in the morning"  When 6 in the morning clearly isn't night.    Plus, I find it very hard to beleive a parent who's child was seriously ill in the hospital, would be on Yahoo! answers the first moment they got.    Now lying, THAT makes you a terrible parent.|`|fESoEbgzaa	no please dont think you are    accidents happen|`|AA10771601	keep your floor spotless and where she plays clean of little things unsuitable for babies.

It went right into the roof of his mouth! he was ok though just remember to ALWAYS try to watch what they are doing, your not horrible accidents happen!|`|uly3aFqtaa	You are not a bad Mother. You are feeling guilty because you couldn't stop her. The truth is, accidents happen all the time and all babies/toddlers do things like this at least once in their childhood. If it's small emough to fit in their mouth, they'll put it in there. It's just what they do! my Mum's friends child swallowed an OPEN Safety Pin. Just thank God that your daughter didn't stumble upon one of those.    When I was younger, I swallowed a pendant from a necklace. I didn't choke, but I do remember it hurting as it went down! I too was taken to Hospital. My Mum is amazing, so it just goes to show that just because a child swallows something, it doesn't mean they have bad parents.    You are NOT a bad mother. A bad mother wouldn't contact the Hospital in the first place. Come on, you created a human being. You are not a bad person at all :)|`|sAAnquoTaa	Noooo! As mommies we try our hardest, but we can't always keep everything away from the babies...trust me, I'm a blind mommy that's always trying to make sure there isn't stuff I can't see where she can reach it.|`|xcPghcw9aa	Well you are not a bad mother...babies just don't know what they are picking up. just have an eye on baby and see if she don't pick up anything to be put in mouth. I hope your baby feels better.|`|732c8aa6cd004765b25dffe2c773041eaa	YOU ARE NOT - let me tell you my "bad mom" story, I work nightshift and normally my 2 year old goes to daycare but due to a snow storm his daycare was closed.  I tried to entertain him all day but by noon i crashed out on the couch, my hubby and I child proofed the entire hosue (or so we thought) we even switched the door knobs in the bathrooms so that you can "lock" your self out and he wont get in well the little genious managed to open the door with a penny and grabbed a bottle of tidy bowl and poured it all over himself.  when i woke up 2 hours later he was blue from head to toe of course first thing i check is his mouth to make sure he didnt swallow any (luckily he didnt) finally he turns to me and says Look Mommy Im Bluuuuuuue!  He was blue for 2 weeks nothign would remove it from his skin.  That night I cried and cried and cried all i could think about was what if he had drank it or what if he had filled up the tub and tried to take a bath.  Kids are kids and no matter how much you watch them its almost impossible to keep your eye on them ALL the time.  You are NOT a bad mom, you are a normal mom dont beat yourself up over it take it as  a lesson learned go through your house and try as best u can to child proof it and hopefully nothing like this will ever happen again.|`|JDA6u7kTaa	You are not a terrible mother. These things happen. You rushed her to hospital which makes you a good mother. Hope she's ok.|`|F7uluzCGaa	No, you're not terrible. Just keep a closer eye on your daughter next time|`|VS78dqO9aa	I could tell you many many many stories of terrible mothers.  I can't tell you whether or not if you are a terrible mother, simply because Idon't know you, anything about you, other than your 9 month old swallowed a pen lid.  But I can tell you that accidents do happen!!!!  Everyone goes through them at some point!  I hope that she is okay!  What are the docs saying?    When your angel is home though, I do suggest cleaning, and starting a system, where you regularly look for things to keep out of her reach!!  Do some extra baby proofing before you get to bring her home!|`|tZxVey2baa	Kids get into things.I remember I swallowed a toy when I was a kid but I had a great mom.Dont take it hard and just be happy shes ok.|`|c20207b79edb6a1d68e27d7750bd7d9caa	no, ur not a bad mom.... baby's put everything in their mouth! you would only be a bad mom if you had ignored it, but you didn't! hope everything goes well!|`|es6l59Unaa	No your not a bad mom. I know it feels horrible! When its hard 2 give baby my full attention, when cleaning or washing,etc i put them in a swing or mainly a play pen so that i know there is nothing they can swallow. I have never really cared for putting baby on the floor.. You will feel better when your baby comes home..|`|xGI9z01Maa	Get over it now.  My daughter has had the tip of her finger cut off when she was under 2 [her brother closed the bathroom door on it because he was trying to help keep her out of the bathroom] (she was with my mother and I was over a hundred miles away), she also fell in the fire for the fourth of July when she was 4 1/2 (she was being watched by a lot of adults, I was nursing the new baby inside my friends house at the time), she fell down a flight of steps when we were on the way to the doctors office to get the stitches out of the finger when I realized that I had left my money in the apartment and need it for the store after the doctors.  I told her to stand away from the stair, and 30 seconds later she was going down the stair.      And I can't tell you all the other things that she has done and her brother and her sister.  She will be in high school next year.    Does this make me a bad parent.  No...It just means that I can't be with her every second of the day.  You do what you can and try to make things safe but over all the child has to make mistakes and will get hurt.  No worries things like this happen.  You will both get over it.  Her faster then you.  Then you will be telling this story to all the boys that she brings home when she older and have a good laugh.  Do not be too hard on yourself.  It's not like you left illegal drugs on the coffee table and she eat them.  Then you can feel like you a bad mother.      Just do the best you can.  No one is perfect and your daughter will tell you daily when she turns a teenager.|`|4CtHdiuBaa	no your not a terrible mother at all, these things happen, somtimes babies pick up things like that and think i will try that. It was just an accident you probably didn't think you left it on the ground|`|t4UgEGkraa	Sorry to hear that your baby is going thru that...and no your not a bad mother accidents do happen.|`|59GymH27aa	No hun, you are not a terrible mother.  I'm sure she will be fine.  You just need to keep more of an eye on her because at that age they will stick anything in their months.  I am constantly checking my LO for things that she manages to find and put in her mouth.  I hope she is ok and try and realise it was an accident|`|5I6ZQUn7aa	Kids are always like this. eating whatever they get on the ground. Be careful in the future :)
u0mZAPuDaa	My pediatrician told me that she could be given some, sometimes. He told me this at her nine months check up. I was then told I could completely switch to milk at one year.    You have to remember though, milk has vitamins, but not near as many as the formula! You also need to take in to consideration that milk is fattening. It is good in moderation. It wouldn't be a good idea to go from 20 ounces of formula a day to 20 ounce of whole milk.      When my daughter is a year we will be switching her to PediaSure. I want her to get as many vitamins and nutrients as she can!        Here is an awesome site on why you should wait until their first birthday to give them whole milk - http://www.wholesomebabyfood.com/milkfor...|`|YmEGCGtnaa	12 mons. you should still just be using formula for his oatmeal. it has too much protein and could be hard on his kidneys.|`|QhVCn7rsaa	Cow's milk should not be used as a drink before your child is 12 months. They are not able to digest it properly.|`|uhj76Fkpaa	I would advice you that you give me whole milk after he becomes 1 yr old just to be sure that it won't cause him any problems|`|2d4bf519052c116a45ae533ba6db1671aa	he is old  enough and  baby oat meal  why not take  a fork  and  mash  some egg  oh try some mash potos  he will love it if he likes potos lol  let  him grow you cant keep  him a baby  for ever lol|`|r97Rzm6waa	12 months as recommended by the WHO, however small amounts in cereal and cooking is absolutely fine.  The main reason for using formula until 12 months is to allow your child to get the extra vitamins whilst his diet gets up to speed and eating what the family are eating most of the day.  If your child has a very varied diet then changing to whole milk by 12 months or a little earlier should be fine, however if he's a fussy boy, then you could consider keeping him on it for longer than the 12 months.|`|sYsfI856aa	The best age is at 1 year of age, aka 12months. Before that they still need the nutrients and other things found in formula. My son started on his whole milk around 10.5 months but only a small glass a day just to slowly transition him into it. He started out with breast milk til 7 months, then to formula, and then to whole milk by 12months.    They suggest 12months though, don't take the formula away completely, but I don't see anything wrong with using it to make his oatmeal, so long as he isn't having tummy troubles from it. Consult your pediatrician as well though, some will have a different opinion for different children.|`|46ddc6b6990fcd5b5d5e36dc7b533ccaaa	The WHO (world health organisation) reccomends 12 months. He needs the nutrients from formula unitl then, but if whole milk didnt upset his stomach its probably ok to give him small amounts occasionally

Thank you.|`|9y1uYUm3aa	probably pregnance or dried blood|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	It's possible it could have been from your hymen breaking,or implantation bleeding. Only time will tell.

It could have just been old blood from having sex, this sometimes happens. Also, you could be ovulating, some women get a pinish colored discharge on the day they ovulate, up to a few days after. If you miss your next period, test. Hope this helps!|`|piDDZ6Ywaa	Well, you should get a pregnancy test, just incase. Most women can still have periods and be pregnant without even knowing. So be on the safeside, yeah? xxx|`|qFy6g5Xlaa	did it feel good!?|`|nic8GvOaaa	Might just be what was left from your period. There shouldn't be any signs of pregnancy this early because it doesn't just happen over night if you know what i mean. If you really have to ask this question you should have used a condom or get on birth control..|`|uhj76Fkpaa	wait until your next period.It's too soon for a sign of pregnancy(only 2 days passed).Have patience|`|dNhgIMIPaa	Were you a virgin before all this? If so it's normal and some girls bleed a little after they loose it. Then again, you may bleed a little too it if was rough sex.  Other option is call implantation bleeding, which mean you could possibly be pregnant. Better go buy a test. You didn't use protection......|`|vaBVFsY3aa	You can have an infection.

It is nothing to worry about. Just be careful so you don't have to worry about things like being pregnant.|`|EBkGtGjDaa	well you can get PREGNANT any time of you period not just before but ANY TIME    if no protection was used most you are PREGNANT    but just to be safe:    MOST IMPORTANT read THIS and TALK BEFORE sex:    1. what protection would do you plan to use?    2. do you know that protection is not a 100% and can fail? BUT BETTER THAN NOTHING!    3. would you make you partner use protection?     4. what would you do if someone got pregnant or you got an std?    5. you do know it only takes once to get pregnant or get std?    here is a list to make sure ready:    1. when BOTH 100% ready mentally, physically, and emotionally    2, your NOT doing it to prove anything, or to keep someone.    3.you know all the myths about sex, you know all the facts about sex, you know about all the protect how effective they are and what would be best for you.    4. you know all the pros and con and will to take the responsibility for what could happen.    5. you keep learning about sex: http://plannedparenthood.org and http://sexinfo101.com    e-mail me if you have any questions    I'm 19 a virgin ( god damn proud of it) with my bf (virgin too) dating for 11 months and no sex|`|4CtHdiuBaa	this usually happens when you first have sex. if it isn't the first time you have had sex i suggest maybe you go to the doctors|`|DITBVWjPaa	What exactly is your question here? You had sex not even 24hrs ago...if you are not on any protection..get some...go to your dr or pharmacy and they will explain it to you. You can get pregnant on your period, mid, and the ends...really nothing like that is absolute and predictable...do what you feel is RIGHT. good luck Sweety! Blood can mean periods...rough sex....a number of things! Listen to your body.|`|3b799e3d18df0e460b9a42cf6e25aba5aa	Doves lov is correct about the possibility of you getting pregnant when you have sex no matter when you have your period. The only effective birth control is taking BC pills exactly as prescribed and also using a condom every time you have sex.    A condom by itself is only 86 % effective at preventing pregnancy and less at preventing STD's. If you just use a condom you have a 14% chance of getting pregnant. Those are about the same odds as putting 1 bullit into a 6 shot revolver, spinning the cylinder and then pulling the trigger with the barrel of the gun pointed at your head. Of course BC pills are 0% effective at preventing you from catching a STD.

q0JTN9QAaa	If you were with the child for a significant amount of time it can be considered physiologically damaging to remove you from its life completely so if you get a good lawyer you could get visitation and possibly even the chance to adopt and share custody.  If your name is on the birth certificate you have an even better chance even though dna shows your not the father you still are in the mind of the child.  If it was years good chance if it was months not so good.  If it is a five year old and you act quick and like you are not afraid to pay for part of the kid you may luck up.    I don't know why you guys split but remember courts hate men and she will air any dirty laundry you guys may have, especially if she is keeping you from seeing the baby just to hurt you.|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	with a good lawyer ..you do ..your the dad from the cord on ,...thats very important|`|xOr67VDiaa	My personal opinion, you have a right, you must plead to whom ever it may concern, the emotional affect it has had on you, a woman cant just choose who the father is a stuff with their emotions..Tho in this world ppl can do what ever they please these days, so most likely no you have no right, but i would put a plead in and tell them how you feel and how she made you believe youd always be apart of his life, eles why the heck would you do everything you could for him when you were apart of his life. sorry and dont worry one day you'll have your own baby and forget about everyone else in the world.|`|DmXexkZdaa	I don't think you do but you should look into it. Sometimes the law is good to someone who is the father to a child, even if the son isn't biologically his.|`|Vad64Jjoaa	Did you sign the birth certificate? If not, and even if you did a she could ask for a DNA test to be done, then no unfortunately you have no rights. It is very sad. She is taking a father away from her son. Maybe give it some time and express to her how you feel. Let her know that you want to be a part of his life even if that doesn't include her. Let her know that you don't want him to grow up without out a dad. Maybe once all the anger subsides from the break up she will be able to see things more clear and let you be a part of his life. I hope it all works out.|`|QhVCn7rsaa	I have a friend in exactly the same situation as you. He was daddy to his ex's son for 5 years. When they broke up he was heartbroken over the child not the girl.     I'm not sure if you have any rights to access I think you should definitely contact a lawyer and get some legal advice, they will be able to tell you exactly where you stand.    You sound like a great person, some biological fathers run out on their kids, you took care of someone elses child like he was your own.    We need more men like you in this world. I really hope you have rights and get to continue your relationship with your son.    Good Luck x|`|rog4GDgaaa	How long were you a part of his life?  I think after a certain amount of time taking care of him and being his provider/guardian that you are a parent in some sense. Sort of like living together 7 years is common-law marriage. Not sure if that is true in all states, etc. Depends on how old he is and what arrangements you've had in the past.  if you can show you've been his provider and she had you acting as role of the father all that time- you might be able to get something, but I doubt it'll be custody. Visitation at best...|`|audIMxn7aa	I hope you live in California. That state would actually make you pay child support,  Because you were in a sense the babies father and I'm sure also provided for him financially.   Even if you wanted nothing to do with them.  So file what ever you need to file, If anything you are showing the mother that you really do care.  Good luck.|`|MzbxcAnWaa	no rights what so ever unless u signed the birth papers.|`|xGI9z01Maa	If you have been in his life this long, then you have the right to visitation and even custody depending on the state.  You should fight.  you don't want this child to think that you are walking away from him.      See a lawyer.  But note: you might get child support against you if you do fight.  And you might just want to wait for things to relax a bit.  Ask if he can come visit for a week in the summer.  Tell your ex that you would like help her out and take him one weekend a month so that she can have some time off to go out.  But make sure that you don't use the child for information or to make she life harder.

w9TwPU2paa	thats like saying. I want to be rich, but not right now. he is probably scared, but he cant be as scared as you im sure. wow. that is young to be having a baby. He is young as well and has a lot of growing up to do. you both do. I just had my first baby ten months ago. you are in for some hard times, but more than that you are in for a beautiful exlperience. The love for a child is like no other. i wish you would have waited a few more years so you could enjoy your childhood. dont worry though. It will work out the way it is suppose to. I am sure you have family that will love, help, and support you and the baby. if you have a family that is there for you then you wont have to take on the burden all by yourself.  As for your boyfriend, dont let him throw you around and play you. I dont know both sides of the story, but you deserve to be happy and he should be faithful and honest with you.  If he plays you, dont put up with it.  dont let him win that game. You dont want to be the girl on the side who always takes him back when he is ready to come  and go. good luck. have fun, picking baby names is fun, go to good will and buy cheap cute baby clothes, plan a baby shower. do what you can to help yourself be positive. and dont stress to much. it will all work out.|`|5f6XnInEaa	Don't worry about it.

You could get help from the state. Forget about him. He sounds worthless.|`|BVaOnbo2aa	Life is about more than the yearning emotion people feel called love. In fact, now that you're about to have a wee one, it's gonna take a serious back seat to the practicalities of life. This feeling you're experiencing will eventually become a much lower priority in life because real life and "REAL LOVE" is so.... much.... more.    It's letting go when they need to go, regardless of the reason.  It's accepting them for who they are including when they're not right for you.  It's not wishing they would change.  It's setting your own personal boundaries so they can respect you which is a prerequisite to love.  It helps you find the strength and intelligence to get through the hard times.    Love your baby and love yourself. Wash your hands and keep away from things that are unhealthy for you, and you'll be on your way to having the real thing with a man too.|`|MzbxcAnWaa	hoenstly, stop worrying about him and do everything for ur self and ur child. u shouldnt have to deal with stress over him, your pregante, and its real life, if he chooses to be involved that on his own self.    crying ur self to sleep is not heathly and could cause problems with birth because of stress.|`|EgeId6TKaa	Why would you want him back?

He needs to learn that it takes two to tango, and he can't just leave you like that!

Your baby should be the only thing you should worry about not a jerk that doesn't wanna be around you right now.|`|XSBsomfVaa	A lot of couples tend to "break up" when they are having a baby.

You don't want him in your life if he doesn't want you in his. It's his loss anyway!!

I hope you have looked into giving up your child for adoption.  A child deserves two parents, and this guy will not be the father your child needs.  Somewhere there is a family praying for a child, and they can love your little girl and provide the things that a child needs.    As to this guy, he does not love you.  He is being bad to you and will not be a good father to your daughter.  Give up on him.     If you do keep the child, go after this guy for child support, but don't look for love from him.    I'm sorry, I'm sure you wish there was an answer for this, but you can't make someone grow up and love you and do the right thing.|`|J22LCHoUaa	Why would you want that piece of trash with you
6XR6ajTraa	I never used any of that stufff but ovulation sticks are the best. 4 days late are you getting any sypmtoms of being pregnant?

You have taken all the precautions and pills...really is your period due...period symptoms mimic pregnancy symptoms! Go see your doctor..or if you are extremely worried..go get a EPT test.|`|BVaOnbo2aa	I had pregnancy symptoms on a monthly basis during the first 3 years we were trying to conceive. So if it's on your mind, looking for symptoms is useless.    The only sure bet is a missed period and a pregnancy test that shows positive. If you don't want to get pregnant, then get on some real birth control else you'll be asking the same exact question month after month. Too much stress if you ask me! :-)
2HETgiwgaa	If you have never tried to get pregnant, there's nothing to suggest you can't - I got pregnant with my son at 32 (first time I "tried" - actually did not not try, if you know what I mean :-)).  Also, the reason you usually don't get checked out for problems until after a year of trying is because it's not unusual to take that long.  So even if they've been times you think you had the opportunity to get pregnant, you can't read anything into getting to your age without it happening.  BABY DUST when you're ready to TTC :-)
pQBjqMkoaa	here you can treat it by doing these things:    http://www.emedicinehealth.com/bee_and_w...    i dont think its bad unless you got stung more than a handful of times    dont put your dog outside    wasps wont go away they will build their habitat again so you should get insect spray for them
uhj76Fkpaa	you can get pregnant each day of the month even during your period...and if we count the days I would say that she was more fertile at that time!!So yes!|`|LKIhUMCgaa	she can get pregnant any time of the month if having unprotected sex. i got pregnant on the last day of my period...so yes!|`|yV373JUiaa	That would be around the most fertile time.|`|yQVcIfa8aa	YES!!! this is the most dangerous time to have unprotected sex!!!! use protection!|`|AA10246871	You can get pregnant at any time during your cycle, but 2 weeks before your period is generally when you are ovulating, and that's your most fertile time.    So the answer is a big, huge YES.|`|qXw9RqN1aa	You are most fertile 15 days into your menstruation cycle (assuming your cycle is 28 days. Everyone's cycle is different so yours might be 26 while a friend's might be 31), so yes. You can easily get pregnant two weeks before your period.|`|wKuQC4yTaa	you get pregnant easiest 2 weeks before your period is suppose to start|`|Ddb5821Jaa	yes|`|aR1OiJ7Waa	2 weeks before your period is when you are MOST likely to get knocked up!  This is the between the lutteal and follicular stages called ovulation.  The egg is released from your ovary through the fallopian tube to the uterus.  Hormonal levels change to encourage conception, and as a sociobiological encouragement to conception, you will be the most horny during this time!    If this explanation is over your head, you're probably too young to be risking motherhood!|`|xVs6vFhXaa	yes|`|J22LCHoUaa	Yes sounds like she can be ovulating during that time so chances are higher but she can get pregnant at any day of the month.
LKIhUMCgaa	no, the test can change result any time after 10mins from being taken and is not accurate anymore. so u'll have to take another one and see wut it says within 5mins, after 10mins, throw it away.|`|yV373JUiaa	nope. No test should be read after the 10 min limit. The test is considered inaccurate and you should test again with first morning urine.|`|xVs6vFhXaa	just take another one, 50/50 chance of it being right or wrong after an hour|`|yQVcIfa8aa	disregard it, do another test, you shouldn't read them after 10 minutes.
VbUpMxrvaa	Probably.  You could probably find someone better anyways.  Friends are friends because they like and dislike a lot of the same things.  you'll probably figure out why they broke up soon enough.|`|STumBiU0aa	if you try to date your best friends ex, then you are violating the friendship code - even if she says she doesnt mind that you are dating him, she probably does mind and you will end up having to choose between your best friend and your crush.  Remember, friends are forever but men come and go.  There are lots of other suitable bachelors out there so suck it up and stop lusting after your best friends ex.
LKIhUMCgaa	i didn't start showing till i was 18 weeks pregnant, i mean i showed NOTHING, and then once i hit the 18 week mark, a giant belly popped out of nowhere, i got yelled at by my doctor bc within 2-3 weeks i gained 10 pounds real fast, which was my belly lol my b/f's mom's jaw dropped when she saw me, bc just a couple of days ago i had no belly and all of the sudden this big belly was sticking out lol|`|Y7sio6Yhaa	5 months, yes everyone tells u you'll start showing at 3 supposedly, but to tell u the truth i could STILL hide it easily if i wanted to and i'm 38 weeks pregnant. i only gained 20 pounds and all in my uterus lol the doctor has even had me drinking boosts and i haven't gained more weight, but it's not like im unhealthily skinny for the pregnancy they say everything's ok.|`|yQVcIfa8aa	everybody is different, it depends on body shape, what position the baby is ETC, so i wouldn't worry, i am 5 months and only people i tell know that i'm pregnant, you will pop out soon enough, congratulations.|`|6cN8aLnaaa	Every woman is different. I've known women that hardly show at all. I, however started showing from the very beginning and was enormous by the time I had her.|`|6988FTAYaa	with my first child i didnt starting showing until i was 5 and half months pregnant! with this child im thinkin im around 3 months and im starting to put a little weight but some people dont know im pregnant again...but every woman is different cause of there body type! but im sure you will be showing b4 you hit your 7th month...congrats|`|BVaOnbo2aa	I'm a bit overweight to begin with, but it's funny that I didn't really think I was showing so much as that I just looked heavier.. my sweater is a little more filled out.    Meanwhile, my husband has insisted that I've been showing since 16 weeks saying my belly is just nice and round. LOL    It's possible other people can see it even if you can't!  BTW, I lost a lot of weight in the beginning of my pregnancy so am still under from where I started. However, my belly is getting way out there now and I'm 21 weeks. :-)
1CryEnb3aa	Sounds like ovulation symptoms.  Go for it and good luck!
KbcbAKi4aa	It sounds to me like how I felt with all four of my babies at 5-6 weeks!And no it is not too early to test!Go get one!!!LOL!Good luck...I hope that you want one because it sound like your body is busy making one!=)|`|kaqPSgTVaa	It's not too early to test if you think you are 5/6 weeks. Take a test now. It would give you accurate results. With my first I got a positive 14 days after ovulation, so week 4. With my second and current I got a positive at 3 1/2 weeks.     Go for it girl. It's the only way to know for sure.|`|TM3pNz6kaa	try a test if it comes back neg go see your GP|`|6988FTAYaa	it sure does sound like your pregnant just go and get that test and make that first appointment to the gyno..good luck|`|GcCdTgrxaa	Oh for goodness sake, stop second guessing if you are pregnant or not. By the way, havent you heard of contraceptives.|`|HxdV815Caa	could be ... just take the test|`|rnUr1JJ7aa	Take A test
2HETgiwgaa	No - I don't think that could happen - mother nature's got it pretty sussed as far as sperm getting to egg - but, I agree with Diane - it could be implantation bleeding if you're pregnant.  See the link below for more info - look for the heading "What are common reasons for bleeding in the first half of pregnancy."  BABY DUST|`|1CryEnb3aa	Sounds like implantation!  Good luck to you!|`|6XR6ajTraa	sounds like you could be having an implantation bleed.|`|6GIp6pM3aa	sounds like possible implantaion bleeding!! Good Luck!
i557GwTuaa	No.How old is the sperm? Sperm can live up to 5 days in you. So if it is more than 5 days, the sperms are "dead". Good luck! I hope you will get good news soon. XX|`|AkFag8tNaa	Good question. I doubt it has any impact because  gravity takes hold and any "foreign" matter gets expelled (the vagina is self cleaning).|`|2HETgiwgaa	Sperm can live for a few days in your uterus and fallopian tubes.  Your CM gets friendlier to sperm as ovulation approaches, to make it easier for them to travel through the cervix and help to keep them alive.  Your egg only has 12-24 hours to get fertilised, so the sperm have to be there ready to go around that time (either because you had sex that day or in the few days beforehand).  I checked some old answers on yahoo to similar questions and it seems your body will attack and absorb any sperm that die - so, no they wouldn't stop the fresh sperm getting to the egg.  See the link below for more info on sperm than you'll probably ever need :-)  I chart to maximise my chances (to make sure I BD at the best times) but it can still take a while, so try not to stress if it does - try mymonthlycycles or fertilityfriend.com if you want to try charting - they also have lots of answers to other questions you might have about TTC - good luck :-)|`|6XR6ajTraa	No it can not. You body will dispose of the old sperm and fresh ones swim straight past them anyway if they are still there.|`|vKvNDPbDaa	no it won't get in the way.  but if your trying to get pregnant you sould have sex every three days not to use up your guys supply.  fresh sperm can live up to 72 hours.|`|rC13xf7xaa	i think that old sperm cant stop new sperm they just keep on moving
AA12400627	Keep trying and you will soon enough! I don't doubt it if you are both trying! 27 is not too old to have a baby! It is about the right age to have one, but personally I think it would be best if you two were planning tobe together for the next 18 years for that baby you're making....    Good luck with that and I hope you will get your good news soon enough! By the way, also get checked by your Gynecologist doctor to make sure everything is alright with you....have him checked too if you both have some sort of medical....it does not hurt to be safe!|`|kaqPSgTVaa	You have a good chance but let me tell you that it takes many couples up to a year. I know that's a long time. It took me a year to get pregnant with my second after not having to try at all with my first. It's frustrating but it will happen when it's meant to happen.     Just make sure you are tracking your ovulation dates and keep at it. It will happen. :) Hang in there.|`|2N4j1ficaa	if you have sex and no protection then  there is a very good chance ... but if on a contraceptive long term then its reduced|`|AA10771601	wait 6 months before seeing a fertility doctor.  your chances are still really good.|`|kQC4HX6vaa	Percentage wise, a healthy woman has a 20% chance of getting pregnant every month.    That percentage is low, because you only ovulate once every month and it only lasts a couple of days.|`|io0QtYYtaa	every healthy couple that has regular sex has a 25% chance of getting pregnant every month. and usually will get pregnant within the first year of trying
kaqPSgTVaa	You tested too early. Take a test in two days. You'll get an honest answer at that point. The majority of women don't' get positives until 14 days past ovulation.     Just in case, but I hope you are pregnant, but just in case, did you have sex on the days around the 14th? Are you sure you were ovulating? Women can ovulate anywhere from day 11-18. If you aren't (god I hope you are! :)) then try tracking your ovulation either through basal body temperature or buying an over the counter ovulation kit. It may help things along quicker!    Good luck this month though! I'm crossing my fingers for you. Sorry I got a litle off track buy I had to try for a year to get pregnant this time. I just wanted to give you some tips.|`|1CryEnb3aa	You tested too early.  Wait till your period is actually due and then test.  Some women don't show positive until 6-8 weeks pregnant. Depends on when exactly implantation took and then started releasing the hcg.  The hcg level has to be present to show on your urine test.  Waiting stink, but hang in there.  Good luck
kaqPSgTVaa	I would go ahead and test to ease your mind but it sounds like you could just be having a strange cycle this month. That can be caused by stress, travel, or just hormones.|`|Ws1hky6Zaa	take a test to ease your mind, but most likely not.|`|75oU12V3aa	Well you say your periods are very irregular, so I would take a test and see if you are pregnant. There is no sure way to guarantee that you are or aren't.    Good luck!
vSAQqGa8aa	why dont you have a c-section? otherwise if you decide to have you r child the natural way I belive you will just got back to where you were.|`|1CryEnb3aa	Your body has been through this already.  It will know what to do as it has done it before.  I delivered faster, healed faster and sex felt better sooner.  Don't stress, you will be fine!  Good luck and congrats!|`|xOr67VDiaa	yeah it can make it larger, and thats why you have to do pelvic clenches, its helps strengthen the area too|`|AA10152451	Ask your gyno.|`|2N4j1ficaa	iv got 11 and sex is still great dont worry
71b04ae04f4a311b132775b2d931bd76aa	Is she breastfed or bottle fed?    I think the key is to follow her cues.  She is the best judge of her hunger and her needs right now.      She is too young for fruit juice, can you try plain water?  8 months is very young for that much solid food.|`|pDRAciBnaa	if she is already on 3meals a day,and still wanting the milk i would say leave her be..she wont overfeed and put on to much weight! just follow her lead,if she is hungry inbetween solid and milk feeds give her a light snack a biscuit or something.|`|eKDYbe9Laa	when you feeding that time put some of bad tase thing on your nippils|`|S6Trp9xSaa	Try giving her a bottle of water before hand, often times getting the same fluid amount will make there bellies feel full while still cutting some calories.    Good luck with your cutie!|`|WluRS5ivaa	She needs the milk, she is growing at this stage in life. Baby fat is healthy at this point in her life.  A baby will stop when her stomach feels satisfied. Its better she gets a little more nutrition than not enough.|`|50BdfHuDaa	You should not reduce milk supply to her this soon.  She needs every ounce available.  Do not decrease intake until 18 months at least or talk to your pediatrician first.  I would not recommend reduction!! Also give her gerber juice 1 cup for added vitamin C.  That's what I give my baby since 6 months old to now 14 months.
RgZ5n0b4aa	if they are little red bumps it just could be baby acne (yes there is such a thing) give it a couple days|`|S6Trp9xSaa	Sounds like either a heat rash or food allergy. What did she eat before she went to bed?
71b04ae04f4a311b132775b2d931bd76aa	Is she breastfeeding?  You didn't mention feeding, could she be hungry?  She should still be eating every few hours at 4 months.    Try swaddling her up tight.  White noise may also help.    It's normal to wake a lot at this stage, due to development stuff and teething.  What happens if you bring her to bed with you?  Soothing her and helping her back to sleep is much better than letting her cry alone, but if she cries even when you hold her try not to worry.  Some babies need to cry a little, this is not the same as leaving them alone to cry until they make themselves sick.  It's not biologically normal for babies to sleep through the night completely until they are 2 or so, so don't feel like you are bad parents.  You will probably get phases of good nights and phases of not-so-good nights.    Try to get some help around the house and sleep when she sleeps until this stage is over.  Good luck!  It will get better, I promise.
71b04ae04f4a311b132775b2d931bd76aa	not gaining weight is normal at this age... they gain a lot those first few months and then slow down.    as far as food, he should not eat a lot of solids yet, but I would make sure that everything he does eat is nutrient dense.      Cut back the cereal and anything like crackers/bread.  Avoid anything processed.  Instead, give him egg yolks, avocado, homemade bone broth, mashed organic meat, unsweetened full fat yogurt.|`|oDyNiJi7aa	I would worry about it.  My now 3 year old had the same problem.  She is now 30 lbs. in a 2 T and wears a size 7 shoe which is for a child whom is 24 months old and she is 36 months.   ~It should be ok!|`|oyvOSYx9aa	I would listen to your pediatrician. My daughter is 7 months old and I took her to get weighed last week and she had lost 7oz in 2 weeks, I was worried as you are but the health visitor just put it down to her being more active which she is!   As long as he is eating and drinking milk, which from what you have said it sounds like he is getting plenty, then I wouldn't worry.   Take him to get weighed regularly and if this persists go to your GP but I am sure he is fine.|`|S6Trp9xSaa	Try hard boiling eggs and giving him the yolk with breakfast. Babies that young aren't suppose to eat egg whites yet. But if you moosh up the yolk and add a little milk it will give your little guy a ton of calories and protein. My doctor told me to do this twice a day in addition to the food and milk I was already giving when my daughter wasn't gaining. It worked, she put on 4 pounds by our next appointment a month away!    Good luck with your cutie!
2N4j1ficaa	90% of women do not have a show ... i have 11 children and never had a show with any of them   most time it comes out with the baby ,..on its head|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Some women never notice it or get it. That's ok. :) I never noticed mine. I figured that it happened when I went to the bathroom and just didn't notice. :)|`|Oxdkporsaa	I didn't have a show with either of my first two pregnancies. I think it just varies really. With my third I had a show two weeks before my waters broke. I wouldn't worry about it & just enjoy your new baby boy!|`|Ws1hky6Zaa	im sure you did, but didnt notice it. i really didnt notice mine either.
fDXrRtkHaa	I don't understand this question. It sounds more like bullying to me... Are you his babysitter? If his parents agree, and you are doing this for a reason, then there is nothing wrong with casual punishments, like... Spanking?, Time-outs?, Extra chores? (The last one that I listed only counts if you are watching him for a very long time.) But, to be honest, I have no idea what you're talking about... Good luck.|`|xOr67VDiaa	huh?|`|0zWJlNi1aa	What ya on about?!!?|`|J6vPhmmLaa	If it is your son..    Spankings always work.
qZJIqZ5faa	as long as you will have enough energy throughout your pregnancy to take care of the animal, they can be great , especially to get you motivated to get up and outside. but also remember you will need to have that same energy and time for your pet after you have your baby... which honestly, after a baby you barely have time for yourself at first.... just something to think about.|`|8e5bIYjJaa	I have been a dog owner of two beautiful dogs for four years now and recently become a mother 6 months ago. I found it was a big adjustment for my dogs getting used to a little person being around, but hubby and I made every effort to make sure our dogs didn't feel left out and were introduced to our son straight away.     We had to invest in a couple of items to make our home more 'dog friendly' for our son - like child proof gates for the hallway and a play pen and it's gone really well! Our dogs treat our son like one of the family now and have become his protecters. It's very cute!    Having said that, I will still never leave my son alone with our dogs. It's better to be safe just in case :)|`|sr1niZlTaa	Depends on you and your significant other.  If you plan to spoil your dog like crazy, then you might want to put off on the idea of a puppy.  I'm due 2/14 and we bought our dog ( Mastiff Mix ) last april and from time to time i regret it.  It's kinda difficult to play mommy to him and be full on pregnant all at the same time, but on the other hand its great practice!  When he does something annoying or breaks/chews something I just take a breath and go [ okay. this could happen later on with the baby so, this is just practice!]  It's stressful when i'm having an emotional outpour, lol and he has to go out or he is demanding to have my full attention right then and there, but that goes back to the spoiling i talked about.  He was our first dog together so we went a little [ okay...a lot ] over board when it came to toys, attention, ect.  So, maybe if you go into it knowing that your dog will soon have a baby around you can do it the RIGHT way, lol.  Also- choose your breed well! and know that every dog is different!  Our mastiff was supposed to be a huge coach potato and has turned out to be more like a jack russell than an overgrown Mr. Potato head! lol    I guess to sum it all up- I love my dog...but I wish we would have waited, but now that he's here and the baby is coming i've just learned to cope. On the up side, when I am having a melt down or I get a huge "Mommy" rush my dog is just at the end of the bed...or sometimes taking up the WHOLE bed, lol.    Like Drew Carey says, lol, Spay and Neuter your pets!  haha  ;]meg|`|71b04ae04f4a311b132775b2d931bd76aa	I would wait!      Once you have a newborn you will be very busy and it will be hard to take good care of a dog.  There is also a financial aspect, if you take time off work and spend money on a baby you may not want the extra burden of dog food and vet bills.    Dogs are fun, and sometimes great with kids, but sometimes not.  You can always get one later, so I would wait.|`|i557GwTuaa	It sounds like you really want to be a mommy. I am pregnant now and I still want to buy a dog (another one). But pregnancy is not easy and then to have a newborn baby will also be hard work. Maybe you can wait till you child can walk, and then you can get a dog.     But it is still up to you. Just remember, a baby and a dog take a lot of your time and attention.     Good luck.|`|c7bba398cc3be64f9f0f066a31f19841aa	I don't think you should get one...   Babies should be kept away from animals as they(babies) are highly prone to allergies/infections. Let ur kids grow up and then get dog.     I'd suggest, just concentrate on ur pregnancy and health of ur future kids for now... its a big task in itself.|`|tJRdjdwxaa	Honestly if you want your dog get it now. And if you live with family or friends they can help you when you get pregnant like have a schedule of who takes out the dog when who feeds the dog. Cause you do get tired during the pregnancy.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	That's up to you. I have many friends that have dogs and newborns. :)|`|jOyzcJd7aa	I think you should wait till maybe sometime after the baby is born. I got a girl yorkie and yeah I love her but omgsh it's just so much work.|`|HxdV815Caa	i dont think its a good idea because the hair might get into the baby mouth... and who knows if your baby might be allergic to it

nyDPFTT7aa	Hi Dear, i haven't fell pregnant yet but this is a good question i think all my pregnancy will be my favourite as i have been longing for it for so long. Love and baby dust to everyone. xxx|`|f4zg7LHLaa	i would say 14-20 weeks, because only i could feel him kicking and moving around and i didn't have to share him! :) ever since you could visibly see and feel him moving from the outside, i was bombarded with hands prodding me constantly. >:( lol!|`|AA11661793	I enjoyed my first pregnancy from about 25 weeks til about 35, then I got really uncomfortable. Before 25 weeks I was sick EVERY night. This pregnancy has been completely different, and I am really enjoying it so far, I am 13 weeks 4 days, and hopefully get to hear the heartbeat today at my appointment!|`|TklfCPh6aa	The first month...cause I didn't know I was pregnant and I was on vacation! But seriously...once I knew I was pregnant, I'd say the second trimester.|`|QCVzUC1baa	My favourite time was about 22-36 weeks yes I loved being pregnant and actually quite miss it sometimes.  I had a really good pregnancy. I think I especially loved this time because he was moving, kicking, I was getting bigger and I was so excited. But like most ppl I found the end of the pregnancy very difficult and uncomfortable no sleep and waddling!!! lol|`|dXVA1wHDaa	The end, lol.    That probably sounds awful, but I had a rubbish pregnancy.  Apart from feeling his kicks and seeing him on all the ultrasounds, I didn't really enjoy it.    I hope the next one's better!  I plan on trying to enjoy it more.|`|reO9Dgmsaa	I LOVED being pregnant!  I never threw up and felt so sexy!  :)  I would say my favorite time was around 30-35 weeks or so, since I really enjoyed my giant belly and feeling Sophie jumping around in there!  I also loved how I looked in clothes, and the whole thing just felt so right (that whole fulfilling my female destiny thing lol!).|`|5ZvALiclaa	pushing baby out...cos I knew it was finally all over!!!    Other than that though, I also like the 6-7 months stage the best because of the same reasons, and the fact the maternity clothes actually start to fit right!|`|uhj76Fkpaa	same as you.The 2nd trimester was the best|`|BQYXgtq7aa	I think I would have to agree. Around the middle of my second trimester, as the morning sickness (and evening and nighttime LOL) had eased considerably and I could feel the baby kicking inside me. It was wonderful.   Oh and because it was before the labour, heart burn, delivery, etc LOL :-)    The best part is now.. because he is constantly reminding me that he's in my life and he is able to teach me so many things I'd never known before (and probably quite a few I didnt want to know anyway!!)|`|x647LeB2aa	The conception ...|`|s1ePCpOeaa	As soon as the pain stops! ;p|`|rTtbyHu5aa	mine was about 7/8 months. I had  very small bump and it wasnt obvious I was pregnant until late on. I loved people asking when I was due. Also going on maternity leave from work made a difference. I just felt really healthy and good about myself at that point.
fHjSonssaa	I've wondered this question at one time or another- but haven't thought about it seriously because our little one doesn't walk yet.  You said you live in a small town- so my guess is the mall is small- I culd be wrong.  I love in MN a few miles from the Mall of America- that's where we often go just because all the shops are there together.    What I see a lot of it is the parents of 4 and 5 year olds pushing an empty stroller. That way it's there if you're out  for a longer time and they get tired- it doesn' out a damper on YOUR day because they're too tired to walk, plus, if you have a stoller with a small basker in the bottom -you have a place for the kids snacks and even a place for shopping bags or your purse.    In a smaller town- I think I it would all just depend on the length of time we planeed on being out.  Were we JUST going to the mall and then home- for a quick trip?  Or will we be out for the day?    My friend has 2 girls.  A 4 year old and an 18th month old- therefore they have a double stroller.  So her 4 year old will go in and out of the stroller as she wants and the 18th month old will hang in the stroller.    In terms of safetly- not how much the child wants to walk- well I think I'll teach my son to be a hand-holder.  My 1/2 brother was an excellent hand holder and never got put on one of those "leashes" you see some parents with- and  like I mentioned, we live in a bigger city.    I don't know exactly how you were asking the question- but this is my take so far (we have a 10 month old)|`|SlBsJ3NRaa	2.5 or 3. After that, it just makes the parent look lazy. My little sister was kept in a stroller until she was 6. And to be honest, it looked stupid and I wouldn't take her out with me if she didn't walk. Same with my nephew. My sister pushed him in a stroller until he was 5, then he rode in a wagon until he was seven. Shockingly at 8, he doesn't like to walk and is severely overweight due to being so inactive. We walked from my moms to the park last summer, no stroller or wagon, and it was probably at least a mile and a half. My 3 and 4 year olds made it there, played, and walked back without any issues. My nephew and sisters were about 1/2 mile behind us.|`|5yZxxeyPaa	Well, I brought our stroller with us last year for a couple day vacation at Disneyland. my kid was 7! :)    She was always really happy in her stroller, and it has lots of happy memories for us.  Everyone who knows us, knows we love our stroller.  We have had it since she was 1 year old.  I agree that it is important for the kids to walk and get exercise, too, so I would not use it for regular things like going to the park or mall, but for big long days like D-land, I am all over it!  Also, it is great to have a place to put your stuff! :)    We used one last week when we went. I did get some looks, but since she was so excited, she woke up EARLY EARLY and by the afternoon, she was pooped!  It was either the stroller or go back to our room.     It will be a sad day when we no longer have it!!|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	i HATE when i see kids who are 5 in a stroller. most of them are over weight with over weight parents. my son is not even two and i took him to the mall the other day with no stroller|`|ehvzQRkkaa	I think it is a decision that you and you child have to make together, I don't think there is any reason to be embarrassed to have an older child in a stroller. You have to do what works for you!|`|ReH5EoR0aa	As long as they wanted to.       It should be their choice what to do!   My sons loved the stroller until they felt they were too old for it and decided on their own to walk.|`|krQiDGCHaa	I go to the mall with 2 year old and typically sit them in the stroller.  Sometimes, I will let them walk -- it honestly depends on how well they're listening that day.  Some days are better than others. :)  If they're listening well they get to walk, if not they have to sit, end of story.    Four year olds are pushing it in my opinion.  People, teach your kids to listen for Pete's sake!    I say 3 is the pretty big cutoff, although occasionally the 3 year old I watch likes to sit in the stroller if he's been running around the mall a lot and is tired.  I would never force a child past the age of 3 to sit in a stroller though, I don't think.  All the kids I've ever taught know better by that age, as well they should.|`|ZZzQLjaKaa	I dont think there is an age, vs a time that you have trust that your child will listen and follow directions. I never judge a mommy that has her kids in the stroller, even though they may look old because maybe she is trying to keep them safe, but I live in an urban area.|`|dv1n6lTmaa	My oldest is 16 and I wish I could strap him somewhere at times. My 5 yr old is a do it myself type, so since he was 1 I let him trout on the side till he got tired.     I think if you feel comfortable with you child walking by your side in public then go for it. When your kids feet are dragging on the floor as they are sitting in the strolling it's really time to let them go.     I would have to say the only reason you see things like this is because these kids would probable need to be chased down if let go.     Sad isn't it.|`|IGhUA1Vdaa	Depends on the kids and how rowdy or calm they are. My kids are 2 and 3. They can and will walk besides me and stay with me without running off.     But sometimes to make things easier on me I will put my two year old in the cart and let my three year old walk. Say if the place is more crowded and for my sake so im able to shop.    Your friends may be nervous about losing her child and the stroller may make her feel like her child is safe, even in a low traffic mall.    So it depends on the child and parent really.|`|wmXb8A8maa	wow, i wish that was my desicion to make...My daughter hates sitting in the stroller if we are at the mall..She prefers to walk beside me( or run ) .. LOL  She started this around the age of 14 months...|`|hGNvbC6oaa	My dear lord that's old to be in a stroller!  My son is 19 months right now and since about 16 months I've been trying to teach me to hold my hand and stay close to me in public.  Obviously, if know we'll be walking a pretty far distance, I'll bring the sunstroller or sling.  But for the most part he likes to walk with me.  I'm still in the process, however, of teaching him that running away and laughing is NOT a good thing.  Working on that one. lol|`|aKiynqA6aa	my son is 4 and if my stroller hadn't broken i would still keep him in it.  he likes to run around and get into things and it is just so much easier to keep him in a stroller.  also when you're at the mall or flea markets like we always go to, the stroller is good storage for all of your goodies :-)|`|fb61d99b32eb382445becee914185af9aa	Well my girl is 19 months, she has been walking since she was 10.5 months and I have been encouraging her to walk for the past 4-5 months now.  I mean, its never for great distances, only for the 3 minute walk to the shops and back, and she rarely walks 100% of that.  But I like to encourage her.  I think up to 2.5 years is fine, I would accept it up to 3 especially if it was like an all day outing, but much older than that I think is too old really.|`|aJjV5b95aa	My son has always been very independent. My the time he was 2 1/2 he did not want to sit in the stroller anymore, he want to walk with mommy. Of course he did really well the first 15 minutes or so and they started to try and do his own thing so bout this things that goes around his wrist and mine and it helped a lot. If we were going to be walking more that 45 minutes or so I brought the stroller just in case.|`|AA11210211	I started letting my son walk beside the stroller when I had my daughter he was 2 1/2 yrs old.We didn't have a double stroller and didn't have the money to by a double stroller so I thought it would be a good time to teach him,He is now 3 1/2 and walks wonderfully next to me and he'll hold on to the side of the stroller.|`|mx3gFmIKaa	My oldest son gave it up at about 2.  My 3 year old loves the stroller.  I would expect he would continue to be in a stroller for quite some more time.  He has autism and cerebral palsy, but looks normal so we get judgemental people staring, or even making snide remarks.  I tell them I prefer it to a wheelchair.  And he is not at all overweight.

NqEZ120iaa	We have recently potty trained our son. We did it by havign no nappy or underpants on him for 3 days. He understood quite quickly what was expected of him. In the beginning we reminded him every half hour that he might want to go.    Try not to make anything of it if shw has an accident, just clean it up and remind her to try get to the toilet next time. When she does go to the toilet flood her with praises, so that she enjoys the attention of going. Children love attention, and it sounds like she might be getting more attention by not going than if she did go.     Good Luck|`|1hciyvKdaa	Make it a potty party, everyone needs to take her when they go or just before they go whatever, praise and all that for good, no need to mention if theres nothing. She needs to see that everyone goes. Make it like oh darn I gotta stop having fun, can you go with me, and then take her in short not alot of talking, after having so many people take her and she sees its the norm she may imporove NO drinks after six and an early bedtime 7 or 730. The later you keep her up, itll be unfair to not let her drink so keep her going to bed ontime. People need to set their alarms and drag her to the bathroom, no talking at all, just try to rouse a little if no response take her sit her down, dont let go she can fall over, wait a moment or two and back to bed, gotta do it twice a night. Someone asap in the morning needs to agian do it and then return her to bed if its earlier than her time to get up. Good sleeping habits are key.|`|cypZ0ykXaa	hi! if she does'nt like to sit on potty & prefer toilet instead, then bring a cartoon printed kids toilet seat. my son liked it when i started potty training him|`|3JLg1tcRaa	Put her in cotton undies.  That will make her learn really quick that pee is gross and wet.  You shouldn't tell her she's nasty when she goes in her diaper, just tell her it belongs in the potty.  And also when she has a bowel movement go to the potty with her and put it in the toilet and tell her "this is where the poopoo goes, not in your diaper".    It will be messy for you to pick up the pee.... and never be harsh that she peed on the floor.  Just tell her to try to make it to the potty next time.|`|AA12380885	Better take her to rest room in the mornings n make her to sit on the commode.In this way she will b habituated for routine habits.|`|VCzsfVM5aa	are you using a trainer seat or toilet.

7aaceef242426e2a1e7394d78368ca77aa	The problem with food stamps is that nutrition education does not come with it. There is also the problem that there are people who only get $10 a month. (I worked at a grocery store and the elderly were usually the people who only had $10 but needed more) Then there is also the rising cost in food. (Big chain grocery shopping is even worse..) A small family will have a harder time with food stamp money than a bigger family because more bulk in food items = less $ per unit. I think a nutrition planning and cooking class should come with food stamps (unless it would interfere with their job.) Things like how to shop, where to shop for the best prices (that will take food stamps) How to freeze things, and sample recipes for low cost healthy meals. They should demonstrate the ease of the meals to teach that they do have the time to cook them and they should demonstrate how to make two batches at once and how to correctly freeze the second meal. They could also take the opportunity to throw in healthy suggestions like buying whole wheat bread and using whole grain rice. (Poor people tend to be the heaviest in my country and food stamps correlates with poor that is why I suggest teaching healthier alternatives to help with that problem as well)     You are not wrong in thinking this. One of my friends gets nearly 500$ and is always scrounging at the end of the month to get food. I have tried to have her come shopping with me, at the time my budget was less and I had one more mouth to feed than her to show her how to shop better to provide more, but she didn't want the information. (she thinks it is just me cutting coupons and using them, but it is not. The coupons help alot but it is not what really keeps my food bill down) She is not the only one. (Her mom had the same problem when she had them too) There are alot of people who do not have food stamps that need this kind of help too, so I think that kind of class should be available to everyone. Especially when everybody is trying to save $$, they could learn how to cut back on their food bill.     One thing that many also do not consider is that what each person gets can vary from person to person. A family of five might only get $150 a month but that is all they have to spend on food. So many things contribute to altering the amount someone would get, so we can not assume that the person complaining is one that receives close to $500.    ETA: Not many people actually sell their food stamps. While working at the grocery store, I did see it a few times. I worked in a really poor neighborhood and people knew they needed food. If they came in my line though, I would not serve them and I would have security escort them out. Another store can deal with federal charges. It is a federal offense to sell your food stamps, especially if it is going to booze (The men that this actually happened to while I worked there, one was buying formula and the other was taking the money to buy a big case of beer) But it does not happen often enough and when I saw it in other lines, the moms were using the money for diapers. (I saw them have an older child run back and get the diapers and had a sigh of relief on their faces) So, that can not be a regular reason. education in menu planning will go a long way... (ETA: It is not he same as money, it can only be used for food, hot foods excluded. Some people can have it put in their bank account, but only those over 60 usually)|`|nFzqGWBDaa	more than likely she's selling her stamps. but i get 463 a month, that's me and my 2 kids soon be 3 kids. everytime u add somebody to your food stamp case the amount will go up.|`|1CryEnb3aa	She is not spending it wisely.|`|r39EDGhPaa	Well, my mom gets food stamps.. like 350 every month.  She's feeding me, my sister, my cousin, my uncle, and herself.  It's really hard.  We have home cooked meals every day, and we eat right.  We just have a lot of mouths to feed, and two of those mouths are grown men..they eat a lot. Some people might be in different situations than it appears.  Don't judge a book by it's cover.  Some people sell their food stamps, so that could be why they are in those situations, or they are shopping at the wrong places.|`|oRzqWhsDaa	buying junk food or the prices where she lives is pretty high I dont know|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	I agree with you... plus the food stamps is not supposed to be their sole source to pay for groceries....as a family of 3 right now we spend about $350 a month on groceries and sometimes that includes the diapers and wipes we need to buy and other things like razors, toothpaste and the like.....( we got to super Walmart) anyhow we eat really well. We eat good foods. Lately I've been cooking good, fresh, dinners for us that can last for days. We get no food stamps and this all on our own... so I imagine people with food stamps can do the same because it's the same as money right?     How can a mother, on nearly $500 a month not be able to do the same?  Maybe because she buys junk for her boys because they are teens....    Sure what we spend on groceries might seem a bit much but take in account that like I said it includes other things too. So maybe we spend like $200 on actual food.|`|prqrQcd1aa	My family of 5 does not currently qualify for food stamps. We are 50 dollars over the income limits. So we have to buy food with money, i spend about 400 dollars a month, i also get wic for 2 children and that, honestly, is the only thing keeping us from not being so broke with having to buy food.  I think people like this are living in area's where food is really expensive or something, either that or they are exaggerating. Some people just do not have good budgeting sense i think.   Another thing that kinda makes me mad is how people like me who really need it, can't get it because we are over income limits.. but then there are people who are single mothers, and live with boyfriends that make good money and they say they aren't living with anyone and they get the full amount allowed for themselves and their children.  Then in my state if you are on cash assistance and get a job that closes out your cash, you get your food stamps frozen for 5 months, meaning you get the same amount as if you were not working at all.   I understand that this will help people adjust better, but why is the same thing not done for people who are saying comming off of un-employment for the last 5 or 6 months? Or even people who had lost their jobs at a good work place, making good money, and then had to switch to a job making less money... i'm talking about much less money here.   I just don't think the system is very fair honestly. Sometimes getting food stamps for some people means that they can get to work, this day in age people are debating over to buy food, or buy medicine, pay for their car payment and so on.  I am glad i don't have a car payment, or i'd be in that situation right now!|`|ZncV5gc0aa	I live off $60 a week. Honestly, the Angel Food Ministries has $30 for a week of dinners and I've went there quite a few times because I didn't have enough money. I actually know that I could get stamps but I figure there are people who need it more than me. I get WIC but that's for pregnancy nutrition. If I can do it, I know other people can.|`|CKQtOusTaa	obviously alot of parents didn't get an education.    you can feed your family for 6 days for under $40|`|iq5uwobOaa	Most likely the mother of three or like most people on food stamps are selling their food stamps for money.    I have seen it so many times.  Than they Plee that they don't get enough money to feed their kids.    My husband and I spend 100.00 a month on food and we eat for a whole month on that.  And we eat healthy.|`|AA10192935	stop becoming single mums and support families, so that mums can avoid eating crackers and cheese.

Dont get me wrong we could spend more, but we could also spend less.     Its called planning your menu|`|OFGE01tRaa	I say it takes $300 per month to feed a grown man. Only by going to a survival rice and beans diet could anybody survive on $150 per month. Food doesn't cost what it used to. The price of things like bread and milk has trebled in the past couple of year where I live. When gas spiked, groceries spiked and stayed there, despite the current drop in gas prices. All this is corruption and price fixing, obviously. Government regulators just look the other way.|`|YrK7S8xtaa	i'm in australia so i dont know how much groceries are over there and what not but i know that 450US = approx 700AU and teenage boys eat ALOT of food.  I have 4 kids but they are all small and dont really eat alot but they eat propper home cooked meals every night and normally eat sandwiches for lunch etc and i would spend around 800 a month on food so i can only imagine how much teenage boys would cost to feed.    EDIT although i guess i buy formula and things in my groceries aswell which would make my bill a bit higher
yrDqtazLaa	You're going to have a big baby. The Glucose Tolerance Test is to find out if you have Gestational Diabetes, which is possible (since you have protein in your urine and your baby is a little bigger than usual). Your blood pressure isn't too bad, normal is 120/80, so I don't think they're worried about Preeclampsia.|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	Try not to worry too much. If you have a history of GD, just watch your intake. And anything between 6 and 9 lbs is considered normal for a newborn. The ultrasound measurements can sometimes be off as much as a pound either way, so don't start thinking automatic c-section or anything like that just yet!     I don't know anything about the systolic/diastolic blood pressure readings and always ask. My last appointment was Tuesday and my BP was 100 over something, I can't remember. It might be a little high but probably nothing to worry about. Once you get 150/30 I think that is borderline pre-eclampsia (which I had in my last pregnancy and did just fine).|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	those things can be way off. they once measured my step mom very small and were concerned- my little brother was close to 8 pounds. they will jsut make sure you don't have GD and what not   mlike another poster sadi though- if you havent had a glucose test yet then it's routine. every woman gets one between 26-29 weeks or so|`|VjV7W6qLaa	kool|`|vcxdTXbraa	baby sounds alittle big but maybe your dates are off?? Protein in your urine means pre eclampsia I believe. Your bp is perfect. Glucose tolerence test is something everyone does at this point in their pregnancy. I drank orange soda and sat their for an hour and then had my blood drawn. If you pass then you do not have gestational diabetes|`|Hu9yquP4aa	They are concerned that with gestational diabetes that you can be having a larger than normal baby.   It doesnt sound like your baby is larger than normal, but keep in mind, all pregnant women do a glucose test at around 28 weeks.     Protein in your urine can signify diabestes or preeclampsia.|`|GdSzrtmAaa	I am not sure about the tolerance test but I think your baby sounds pretty healthy to me and blood pressure is normal.|`|DQLNcWqyaa	Gloucose tolerance test I believe is to check your sugar levels. I would be more concerned with the protein in the urine. How much and why. Do you have a history of spilling protein?|`|g5xnXkQkaa	I am 33 weeks and go to a specialist weekly because of the GD and they told me that the baby weighs 6lbs 8 oz :) and ur bp sounds normal to me :) Good Luck!!|`|X1ACfL8eaa	The weight of your baby seems a little large but scans can't be perfectly accurate when it comes to weight. Your blood pressure seems fine. I think it's on the high side but not too much, and protein in your urine can be a sign of preclampsia. The glucose tolerance test is normal procedure for every pregnant woman that checks for gestational diabetes.   You shouldn't worry about anything until you have all your tests done and until your doctor gives you reason to. If your doctor was worried about something I'm sure they would tell you.|`|ZErpLwQUaa	you might be having another big baby, and the BP being 130/70 is somewhat something to look into. normal is anything UNDER 120/80. you are somewhat above that, so calm down and eat better. do not try to lose weight while pregnant. the Glucose tolerance test will test for pregnancy induced diabetes, which if you do have it will go away after the pregnancy.
iq5uwobOaa	You will count from the first day of your last period.    The pill can mess you up somewhat when coming off the it.    HOPE THIS HELPS BELOW    Based on your answers, you're likely to be most fertile from Friday, January 16, 2009 to Wednesday, January 21, 2009. If you were to get pregnant during that time, your due date would be Monday, October 12, 2009.   Of course, you may not conceive right away. But here's good news: 85 percent of couples who simply stop using birth control conceive within a year. You'll only increase your chances by knowing your fertile periods.     Here are the days you're most likely to be fertile over the next five months -- as well as prospective due dates if you conceive. Good luck!     Fertile days  Resulting due date    February 13, 2009 - February 18, 2009  November 9, 2009    March 13, 2009 - March 18, 2009  December 7, 2009    April 10, 2009 - April 15, 2009  January 4, 2010    May 8, 2009 - May 13, 2009  February 1, 2010    June 5, 2009 - June 10, 2009  March 1, 2010    July 3, 2009 - July 8, 2009  March 29, 2010|`|X7DDlR1caa	its from the first day of your previous period, but the pill might have messed your periods up slightly, don't get over exited in case its just hope. But if your not on within the next few days- week, get a test  i Wish you all the best   x|`|IYVxt96Baa	the last period is counted from when you first start to bleed so yours would be on the 5th January. Your cycle may be irregular after coming off the pill sometimes can take a few months to fall into a natural rhythm.   If you have been having unprotected sex though there is a chance that you may be pregnant so would wait for a week after your expected period date and then do a test ( only suggest waiting due to poss of irregular cycles) . Do you know how long your cycle was before you was on the till this could help determine the dates as my cycle was not the regular 28 days.
fTLzKg5Eaa	I got mine 1 week before Period... are you feeling symptoms? if you do normally its because that your HCG levels are high enough to cause you symptoms therefore you would see it on the test... but I would advice to take test in the morning urine... any way best thing to get pregnant is to Relax totally adn to not obsess about it... I tried it myself and it worked... Good Luck with everything|`|75oU12V3aa	You can probably have a qualitative blood test, which determines the levels of pregnancy hormones in your blood, even if they're very low.

I took 1 of those tests that is supposed 2 detect hcg 6 days before ur period is due and it was negative. Obviously i thought that there was no way i could be pregnant so when my period was 2 days late i did another test which also came back negative. At this point i thought i had something wrong with me.  I waited another couple of days and did another test but this time it was positive! i recommened if u think u r pregnant 2 test every 3 days and dont b disheartend if the first test is negative. I wish u all the luck xx
98WKYtfwaa	I find that Peacocks have lovely maternity clothes that are cheap. Most stores do a maternity section though, but best to buy online because i went into some stores and they had nothing.

It's a pretty big store so there's quite a good choice, and cheap too.  Next maternity, you can choose from the catalogue and have it delivered to your nearest store if they don't stock maternity clothes in the shop.  And funmum.com is pretty reasonable too.|`|U3jS5k9eaa	Hi. I agree maternity clothes are very expensive, especially as they are only to wear for a short length of time. I know dorothy perkins, topshop and new look sell maternity clothes but again are around 30 for jeans. I would keep an eye on ebay as maternity clothes and underwear are quite common and usually in very good condition as the previous owner had only a few months wear. Just a suggestion but when i was in the early stages of pregnancy and my jeans became a little too tight i put a band around the button, through the button hole and back around the button (hope you got that) to give extra room, it really worked until i started to outgrow the leg, bum etc and i was unable to come up with suggestions other than buy new ones :)|`|d1csiCLKaa	Primark and H&M do maternity wear, next do do maternity wear and i actually still wear my maternity jeans i got from next now, they are a bit pricey but can be worn after birth and further, im an example lol|`|Z7dKEJcgaa	I really like the online store called As Seen On Screen www.asos.com    I have also used Topshop (although it is on the expensive side)|`|CUYuAGF5aa	Most of my maternity clothes have came from Peacocks they do some really comfy jeans and trousers not to mention comfy smart/casual tops so would highly recommend them.    Dorothy perkins often have offers on their maternity tops and again they are quite comfy and dressy for work etc.    Mothercare can be a bit expensive just keep an eye out for any sales they have on.    If you have an ASDA close by you should try in there I found the maternity range yesterday though hadn't noticed it since last summer so looks like they are just starting to bring it back again.    Another place I got loads of maternity tops was in the Next outlet shops they are fantastically priced so have a look there if you can find one.    Happy shopping!

aBL04eRbaa	I reckon,   be reallllllly good,   for like, a week or so,   so she is happy with you,   and then,   when you are talking one day,   say you have looked over a few things,   and you think it would be cheaper to go on a plan,   but you are happy either way,   and let her know it's totally up to her.   But you think it works out better for both,   on a plan. :)|`|vI0WnAiOaa	yes my teen asked me this not too long ago actually, i said no after looking at the plan - yes it had all good qualities however cost over $50 a month and i would have had to pay it. there wasnt any way i was going to do that. her paying up to $30 a month for her pre paid was quite enough and really since i pay for allowance then i was paying for her phone as it was.  you could approch your mum but dont get all upset if she says no for these reasons. it might be time to look at your own actions and adjust your ways acordingly.|`|KhmiBbBVaa	sounds like a good deal just ask her|`|ySKK7lCyaa	Tell her that it would be cheaper for her to do that then pay all the extras for text messages.|`|yRlIXECTaa	just go up to her and ask her.
ba1de16220287f2a6ca02288c1a71636aa	I just don't think they make a lot of cute things for boys.  The manufactures might think that moms (dads) don't want their boys in foo foo clothes.  I have a hard time finding cute stuff for my 3 month old son. When I do it has trucks, animals, or dinosaurs on it.  I guess us moms need to get together to come up with some cute clothes for boys.|`|bc9inzicaa	That is very true...when i go shopping, I see all the bright pretty dresses and clothing for girls; but the boys (especially the infant section) is normally tucked away on some corner with only a few racks.      I gave up on Target for clothing for my little guy,  Instead Carter's has a pretty decent selection of clothing for boys that are cute (although not as much as the girl's section).  I need to check out JC Penny and Kohl's.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	Honestly, I don't think I've bought a single item of clothing for my 7 month old son besides socks for his enormous baby feet.  That's why I like hand-me-downs.  Let other people search out the cute clothes for you!|`|XOtHsTo0aa	Yes-it is much harder to find cute things for little boys.  But I've always said...they have much cuter clothes for girls but much cooler toys for boys!!  I always had luck at Dillards for my boys when they were little for clothes (on the clearance rack).|`|mjz8JF9Gaa	i feel the same way   i think its because its nostly woman that make the clothes|`|58b352907ba2def5e2248c3df2e55128aa	I know what you mean...when I take my son shopping we can't see the boys clothes until we wade through the sea of pink clothes. Then, when we get to the boy's rack there are only 3 racks at the most. It's annoying.|`|BW7Nrqjzaa	They do make more clothes for girls. But in the long run boys are so much easier to dress and buy for.    My son, I throw him jeans, a t-shirt and a hoodie. Plus socks and whatever sneakers he grabs first, and maybe a baseball hat- and WA LA- he looks adorable!    With my daughter it's all about matching clothes and shoes and tights and bows and whatever else...! Plus actually putting her hair up and getting those stupid tights on. lol. It's a pain in the butt, but she does look adorable!|`|EHY3FnAmaa	Yes I notice this at every trip.  Its really not fair and I dont agree with your friend saying all boys need is a shirt and jeans. I like to dress my little guy up in cute onesies or dress clothes for occasions|`|o2YHnKXiaa	Well yes I have been to Target and Wilmar and down here there both like that, I live in Ga. I usually end up going to Kohl's or Jcpenny's for his clothing they have a lot at JcPenny's  but it's more pricey.|`|IWinNj2saa	No, it's really harder. However, JC Penney has some really awesome racks for boys right now, with more of a variety than usual. I have been saying the same thing, for the last 10 years. They just dont design as much boy clothes, as they do girl clothes.|`|vJEatJFPaa	I've heard other mommies of boys complain about the same thing on here.....    I have a little gal sorry, but I've noticed Carters has really cute baby boy stuff..Can be expensive but I've seen god sales...|`|Mg2lohdIaa	try kmart they really do have cute stuff i jsut bought some for baby to be|`|ibWLdXlJaa	I hear you on that! Like someone else said though JC Penny's is pretty good when it comes to boy's clothes.|`|wKYdIaZVaa	I see adorable boy stuff ALL the time... I was at Target the other day and their Dwell studio collection only had the boy things left (apparently everyone in Miami has girls)    Anywho.. If you have a Marshalls nearby, they always have the cutest things for both boys and girls. That's where I buy all of Chloe's Ralph Lauren stuff. (and its very cheap!) :)|`|TqOdbhNAaa	Unfortunately, that's just the way it goes.  On the other hand, I can tell you one down side to all of the girls' clothing.  When I had my baby shower last year, all I got was little girls' newborn clothing and pretty much nothing from my registry.  I had to return so many things because they were just not useful for me.  I remember my friend's shower-she got everything on her registry.  She was having a boy.  I guess there's ups and downs to both.|`|olF9Hl6saa	It is MUCH harder to find cute clothes for boys... and it gets harder the older they get. My son is now growing out of "toddler sizes" and i am having the hardest time finding cute boys clothes (in sizes 4,5..) The worst is when you are trying to get an outfit for Christmas or Easter. They have the cutest little dresses for girls, but not may boys outfits ... and the ones that I can find usually just look tacky. My favorite place to shop is Oshkosh. Carter also has really cute boy clothes and Target sometimes too. Good luck.
d8vzlH4saa	When you are with the one person you love and you are so happy, you cant help but think how amazing it would be to create a special person that has come from your love. You won't even think about giving birth. Just think, your mum had to do it, your grandmother had to do it. No-one is saying its easy, because I bet it ain't, but keep thinking every contraction means your a moment closer to your baby daughter or son, that little person who will look a bit like and your partner, how amazing! The pain must be worth it! : )|`|xOr67VDiaa	its a painful process, but its a life experience.. you cant compare to having your own little baby to have a needle at a hospital, when your read serious ? on here it can be a little scary, but everyone is different.. if youre really scared then dont push yourself, but there really isnt anything to be scared of ( touch wood) its all apart of being a woman!|`|QnJvJ67uaa	I actualy went ahead with my first pregnancy because I was terrified of have an abortion and how much it might hurt and all the needles and stuff.  I am so glad I WAS that scared..I have 3 sons now lol.  If I were you I would speak to your doctor or see a counceler to try and talk through these fears...it would be sad if you were unable to have your own children because of a fear of childbirth and hospitals.  On the other hand if it IS that bad and you are willing to adopt, good for you, there are many unwanted babies out there waiting for a loving family.   If you can't resolve your fears don't feel ashamed, get sterilised and adopt a child.  I hope you work it out :)  Good luck xx|`|XsKXmXsJaa	I am also scared but doesn't mean that i never want babies. I like babies too much, its pain full but very pleasant feeling.     Becoming a mother is most beautiful moment for females. ( i heard )
1tmX7xbRaa	i 100% believe that a parent should be involved in their child's schooling. i also believe that employers don't give a crap about their employees 'outside life'.|`|xOr67VDiaa	you cant force anyone to do anything.. its up to the parents to interact with their children's lives at school, so kids are just brought into this world knowing they are great, because they have always been told they were, when others are just lacking alot of attention, you cant change the whole school based on parents that just dont give a ****|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	I totally agree... many parents would love to be more proactive but employer can make that very hard... (once of the reasons I am so glad not to be in the work force.) Some parents have the ability but just aren't. All parents need to take more of n interest in all parts of their child's life.|`|426c7861dc77ee80668e47afb0150a53aa	A to the MEN (AMEN)!!!!!!!!!    God Bless.    Now if more parents or individuals with children thought or foresaw it as you do, then the children would be a lot more productive, if the parents and/or guardians show interest then the children will show interest.  Involvement it should be mandatory, school isn't a mall with state paid employees it is there for a purpose and I can't see how a parent wouldn't want to know what their child is doing or learning.  All you can do is be that involved parent for your child/children and you will reap the benefits of this labor.  God Bless.
f4zg7LHLaa	lol! you are 9 weeks on the 7th day. today is Thursday, so on Monday you will be 9 weeks. Monday is the 7th day, and every monday after that you will be a week further along!|`|o8xNTVWTaa	9 weeks on the 7th day   congrats !!!|`|YrK7S8xtaa	no you wont be 8 weeks 7 days you will just be 9 weeks so when it gets to that day just remember that it will be the same day every week that you change to the next week|`|f50f6a665c054d5ffd525f5a31663073aa	u go 8wks and 6days then 9 wks|`|EraBTmV5aa	awww congrats!  and   8 wks 7 days = 9th week..    but don't get too attached to these numbers, when you have your ultrasound it changes, it changed for me by almost a week.  all the best!
dxlNwGuWaa	I found out yesterday that my cervix cells had thinned.  I had 2 spots of blood after intercourse and went into a flap.  I spoke to a moderator on the ectopic pregnancy trust website and her response was this;    It's a very usual presentation    When you are pregnant the cells which cover the cervix become thinner and what we call friable. It basically means it's easily disturbed    Imagine you have a recent graze on the back of your hand - that you periodically rub firmly with your other hand .... it's going to continue to bleed every time you irritate it.    That's a rough approximation of what happens with your cervix when you have intercourse.    It sounds like it's something you might have to put up with the for the duration of your pregnancy and I am so sorry about that but cervical ectropian of pregnancy is a common condition and usually results in a tiny bit of bleeding after intercourse - sometimes the blood is frank red other times, it pools in a space behind the cervix and then descends over days causing a rusty coloured discharge but it's nothing to worry about unless the discharge is very itchy or offensive. Hope that reassures you    **********************    I am nearly 10 weeks.    Hope this helps!    xxx
jjDTA7VBaa	Sounds to me like you're in labor.  Congratulations and good luck.  May you have an easy labor and a healthy baby.|`|1CryEnb3aa	Call your dr or the maternity ward.  You could be in labour.  Good luck!  Congrats!|`|heoBp6Taaa	Yes sounds like your in labor. Labor for me started with what felt exactly like period pain then a bit later the contractions started..  Braxton Hicks are not painful so if you are in some pain they are most likely ridgy didge contractions..  I wouldn't go to hospital until your contractions are at least 5 mins apart however with it being your 3rd things could happen quite quickly..  Best of luck wishing you a safe and easy delivery.|`|d8vzlH4saa	Get yourself to your midwife or Labour ward, never feel like you are wasting there time. They can ruel out Labour if need be, but it could be Labour!     Good luck, hope it all goes well! x
CY8jAXPDaa	My dad used to hurt me alot when i was really little (5 and under) and my mum promised me all through growing up, i would never be hurt again.  Well then she met my step dad, they went on to have 2 children and he ended up hating me, as what it seems.  He used to slap me across the face when my mum was out and i used to tell her when she got home, but she never used to do anything about it and that really messed my head up.    I will never ever let anyone smack my child, including myself (obviously i can't always avoid school fights) but parents smacking their child across the face to me is disgraceful. Aren't they meant to be your children, and they depend on you to keep them safe and to protect them. I could never imagine my son sitting there thinking 'my mummy never cared, or protected me' i will do everything in my power and beyond to make sure nobody ever hurts him.   Like Danielle said, if you was walking down the street and someone did it, you can get them done for assault, so why on earth would you want to do it to your own flesh and blood, the person you brought into this world.  There are better ways to discipline a child.    I've always said one thing to my mum now im grown up.  I say, i don't believe a parent smacks to discipline a child, i believe a parent smack to satisfy there own anger.   If that's the case, get to anger management.|`|407e267410ec98d0524af9efd1fd2790aa	I completely agree with you! And any parent who thinks that slapping is ok is WRONG, they should have a lawyer on speed dial, cause it's illegal too.|`|uZnnCjJ0aa	i can explain it a bit more personally just email me if you want me to   i will be happy to help with this sort of problem!|`|htBHCNDtaa	Slapping a kid across the face isn't good, a spank on the bum seems acceptable, my mum did it to me only once or twice and it taught me to be a good child and to listen to her and I don't hold it against her.    Hitting a teenager at all is pointless - especially across the face. They're getting to that point where you should treat them as equals, so arguing seems normal in a family, but hitting them anywhere just seems like you're making things worse.|`|ZYEIsoDDaa	when they get to that age, its not abuse any more, its a fight...    when i was 6 my grandmother smacked my bum and i saw it as punishment, a year later my aunty slaped me across the face and that was child abuse    im 17 and once a girl at school slapped me across the face, it started a punch up...    my dad once slapped me across the face and i saw it as him being so angry at me and that i got to his core and made him break...      dont slap them  across the face,  not only is crap parenting but your showing them that your soo hurt by this that you've just broke, you havnt really hurt them at all... unless they are weak, then they will be the ones hurt the most but still know they hit the button to crack you...|`|r39EDGhPaa	I think actually hitting your kid out of anger is not okay, no matter what the circumstances are.    My mom used to hit my sister and I for mouthing off, not just slapping, either.  She's calmed down about it, but it was terrifying.|`|c4d179c54efba1c73a993ab6f248346aaa	my daughter when she was 14 walked up to me from in another room when I was yelling at her to clean up her mess in the kitchen,, she had not heard all that I had said to her, so she walked up and says,, "what the F*CK did you say to me B*TCH"    You better believed I smacked her across the face..|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	Slapping a teen across the face is humiliating....I agree with spanking a child when necessary and when everything else has been exhausted or when they put themselves in danger (touching hot stove, running out into the street...this is where a tap on the bum or hand is really needed to get their attention).....but with teens you need to do something else such as taking away phone time, computer/tv time, all personal electronics, and time with friends.|`|f4zg7LHLaa	my dad actually punched me in the jaw at 16. after he did it, he denied it. but he did it.     i cannot justify that kind of treatment. it is illegal, and if you did it to a stranger in the street, the could report you for assault. why should you be able to treat your children like that?
8uiH6iRbaa	he will be fine it's only from last night. Now if it was from last week or something then id be worried.    my little boy does it quite often i give him his bottle when he is in his cot at bed time and he quite often wakes up in the night or the morning and finishes it off . yuck i know     but i can assure you he's always ok and is never sick.    baby's love to give there mummy's cause to panic and worry im sure you'll have far worse to come lol    my niece sat at the top of her stairs and drank a bottle of mouth wash she was 1 1/2 yrs and her parents didn't know that she had learnt how to open the safety gate|`|c67a2f77ab7471bed4b2f279ff05e2e1aa	When you start worrying about things like this, which are probably totally insignificant, think about this:  in the stone age, babies probably scrabbled about in the backs of the caves, putting all sorts of rubbish in their mouths. Stone age mothers didn't have special weaning foods, so would have given quite small babies all sorts of unsuitable things to try.  And we are descended from the survivors of those experiences. Obviously, there were survivors of those experiences, or the human race would have died out many centuries ago.  Those were the tough ones.  Babies these days, too, are a lot tougher than you think.   So don't fret about things like stale milk unless he shows signs of vomiting or fever or serious diarrhoea.  Which are all unlikely in this case.|`|GN8ky1wOaa	go to er|`|irP2yTMWaa	he'll be fine.I would get it washed when he finished it next time x|`|DQHC3EZuaa	if its vomiting then let your baby vomit so it can get the old milk out of its system.  but if its not then maybe you should just call a local hospital and see what they think  =D|`|ed052b6f800dc43932558f491194a7b8aa	he will be fne the worse that will happen is he may be a little sick but shouldnt do any harm kids have a habit of finding the stuff they not allowed!|`|1831ede9e27aa3948ecfe643b6ae8bfbaa	it's only from last night?  He will be fine.  Milk takes longer than 24 hours out of a fridge to go bad.  If the milk was bad, he would simply be sick.  Don't worry.|`|Mvl95Og8aa	nothin hon, day old milk aint toxic, maybe just taste a lil sour. give him something sweeter to take the taste out of his mouth btu i wouldnt worry too much about it|`|dKi2R2oHaa	Newborns are vulnerable to infections such as listeria, however by now your child's immune system should be strong enough to cope with the bacteria in milk.    In the unlikely event that your baby develops a fever then you should seek medical help immediately, but otherwise you shouldn't worry.
1c498d03fe9bb2e8719c81fe361b9912aa	keep to having warm baths, and avoid hot baths, can b very dangerous, congrats by the way|`|1CryEnb3aa	Sure you can take a bath.  I suggest not to make it too hot.  This can make you feel faint.  Your hormones are all a wack now.  Plus your heart is working over time for you and your new baby.  So, enjoy a nice soaky bath.  When you get to the end of your pregnancy remember: once you start dilating not to take tub baths anymore.  This can allow the bath water to get in and cause infection.  Up til then you are totally fine. Congratss!|`|StxCHnTkaa	Don't take a HOT bath, warm is ok...but especially in the early stages, you don't want to raise your body temp too high or you will cause damage to the baby's brain. No hot tubs, no saunas...|`|627pWyVkaa	Hot tub, As in like sauna, hot tub? Not your just normal tub youd have in your bathroom? your not suppose to have temperature go above 100 Or 38.9 degrees C (thats the precise) one that my preg book says. Its because it will raise your cores body temperature which raises your babies and he/she can't regulate their temperature yet so it changes there temperature and kinda cooks them :S|`|AA11763588	After I had my miscarriage I did some research to find out why it may have happened. One of the things I read was not taking hot showers or baths, warm ones are fine, but not hot ones that they can cause a miscarriage.     To this day I feel terrible about it because I love taking hot showers. This time around I kept it warm.|`|b3892e48ce1ff2d86e671ceef5fd7a83aa	A warm bath is fine :) I take them all the time. A really hot bath, on the other hand, is not. (The same applies to saunas and actual hot tubs.) That's because it raises your body temperature and that's not good for unborn babies because they can't regulate their body temperature yet and it can lead to problems. If at any point in your warm bath if you are feeling hot, or sweaty, or your skin appears red, add cold water immediately.     Congratulations!|`|AS8ii5bjaa	call your mum or any one whom both you and your husband trust ,if that is not posible take advice from a good doctor|`|79eRDIbXaa	Hey - When you are early in pregnancy it is best to avoid Hot Baths as the temperture is to hot for the Baby. However if you realy want one then be sure to have it more warm then hot. Congrats to you xx|`|iq5uwobOaa	You Should Avoid Raising Your Body Temperature   There is a potential danger to the developing fetus if your body temperature rises above 102 degrees. You can raise your body temperature to this level by getting a fever, by exercising too strenuously, working outside on hot summer days, and so on.   You Should Not Use a Sauna, Hot Tub or Take Long Hot Baths   Hot tubs and hot baths have a tendency to raise your body temperature and therefore are to be avoided. See the previous item for details.|`|E08qVHNuaa	Congrats! :)     I got pregnant in October, and if you're like me, you've got a million and one questions. I say get the "What to Expect When You're Expecting" book as soon as you can. It has the answers to EVERYTHING :)     As far as hot tubs and saunas, the book says you can do them for up to ten minutes, but that you should try to avoid them. Showers and baths are fine, as long as they're not too hot, or if they are hot, try to limit your time in them.     For more info, check out the book or whattoexpect.com ... babycenter.com is also really good.|`|Wps4XuqHaa	Yea you can, why wudnt you?
627pWyVkaa	Yes but woman have white discharge when there not pregnant as well. its not something that only produces and occurs while you are pregnant.|`|R4F05z4Faa	This is not approved signs of pregnancy.It may occurs when you more exited.|`|OABhJ8Zkaa	get it checked fast. it can be an infection. though normal with women|`|oQTjeOekaa	i dunno, but men get it a few times a day, and they aren't pregnant...|`|d8vzlH4saa	Yes they do whilst pregnant and whilst not pregnant also.   As long as its not changed from what it is normally like, i.e. texture/smell or you are uncomfortable/itching, its very normal.  If its different and you are concerned you could go to your GP or midwife.|`|v6msLJxVaa	It is common for an pregnanat get white fluid. some times it is more for some pregnant women. good hygene is must in pregnant to avoid any vaginal dieseas.|`|xOr67VDiaa	i dont know about it being fluid, but i know its white discharge and yes its very normal, it can happen almost every time you go to the toilet.|`|aTk0A9SHaa	Women do get increased vaginal discharge during pregnancy as long as its white/clear and doesn't have a funny smell then its perfectly normal|`|AA11763588	Discharge can be from many things.

CUYuAGF5aa	it's hard to tell without knowing your cycle length as everyone is different.  I used website called my monthly cycles for a few months which will work out how long your cycle is, will give you an estimate of when you will ovulate and hopefully help you work it out exactly.  I know it worked it our perfectly for me. (you only need to sign up to the free part)    Good luck!|`|0VHolTVEaa	Use the ovulation calculator by trying it in google. It will ask yr last menstrual period and the days you are more likely to ovulate|`|BOXrOvhcaa	Try to use this ovulation calendar tool.   http://www.softorbits.com/awc/   to trace your cycle and find the date of ovulation|`|YrsiSjNVaa	You will need the legnth of ur cycle to work it out?  How many days do u have each cycle?|`|uVuYdcRcaa	Hi,     If you always came on period on the 21st that would mean you roughly have a 30 day cycle.    On AVERAGE women tend to ovulate 14 days after the first day of their last period, so ...      If your last period was the 21st Jan, 14 days after that it would take you to the 3rd Feb.    If you want a better way of pinpointing if and when you ovulating then ovulation kits may be the way to do. Clearblue do one using a smiley face to show when you ovulating.    All the best, fingers crossed for you!    Lx|`|DDswEgtZaa	well mine started on Jan 20 and yesterday for me was CL 16.    it depends on your cycle length.  try using OPK to see when you ovulate.  if you are a normal 28 day cycle then you already ovulated, prob on feb 1st.  Good luck.|`|8uiH6iRbaa	if your on a 28 day cycle then yes looks right to me     here is what you need to know     possible fertile feb 1st  likely fertile feb 2nd  fertile feb 3rd  ovulation feb 4th  day after ovulation feb 5th    so you need to have sex " 1st 2nd 3rd 4th and today 5th"    the earliest you can do a pregnancy test will be 14th feb    and if u do conceive you will be due oct 8th    if you don't conceive your next period will be 18 feb    and for next month;    possible fertile march 1st  likely fertile march 2nd  fertile march 3rd  ovulation march 4th  day after ovulation march 5th    so have sex 1st 2nd 3rd 4th 5th march    earliest pregnancy test will be 14th march    baby will be due november 25    or if not pregnant your next period will be 18 march    hope this helps     good luck  x  x|`|winmjHAmaa	It depends on your cycle.  Is this your first month trying?  If so, all you can do is shoot for the 14 day month and then in your second month you will know your body a little better.  My advice, buy an ovulation kit at the drug store today!  It will tell you.  Good luck and baby dust!  I am in my first month ttc and in my 2ww.  It is agonizing!
r7q8LW7Aaa	In my experience, a man with a wandering eye will always have a wandering eye. A woman who has been victim of it will always be nervous.  But there are exceptions to every rule. If you feel like he could stay faithful and you could learn to trust him again, then you should give it a try - but I personally don't think I could ever get over it.  I'm a strong believer that parents shouldn't stay together for the sake of the children - my parents did and frankly, I wish they didn't. You don't want to be raising a child in a bitter atmosphere - he/she needs a loving, stable family. If you feel like you need to leave him for that, then you should do it.  I hope you have lots of support around you - pregnancy is a hard enough time.|`|1CryEnb3aa	If you have no trust, what do you have?  I can't say if you should leave or not, but he has already created an unstable home for you and your children.  can you guys go to counseling?  Don't let him make you feel bad, that is his guilt for what he is doing.  Be strong and hope everything works out for you.  Good lock|`|J3TRJPIwaa	If you think he is doing it again you need to make him leave. Which would you prefer you child growing up around - a mother and father who fight and don't get along or a happy mother. I think it would be more beneficial for you to raise this baby without him around so much if he can't stop cheating on you. You will be happier and your child will pick up on that.     Edit: He is trying to play your emotions to get you to stay. You will be able to cope. Find a pregnancy group in your area or once the baby is born find a mothers group. You will find friends to help you through the tough times. The baby won't blame you - maybe when you get to the moody teenager stage, but by then you will be able to deal with the subject. Your child isn't going to question the whole one parent thing until they are school aged and pick up on other people having two. Do you think your partner will send you a check every month and never come around or do you think that your child will still grow up with a dad? Just remember that a child can pick up on your emotions so it would be better if you were happy rather than running to check an empty phone everytime he goes to the bathroom. He sounds like an *** to me. I'm sorry you are having to deal with him, but you will look back and thank god for the wonderful child this man gave to you. The best gift you will ever get I bet. And just a side note I know two ladies who have not stayed with the father of their children and have married another man. Their children know that man as their father since they have never known another.    Oh and I would bet your parents would support you if they knew you were thinking of leaving this SOB! Call and talk to them if you really want to get out of this situation.|`|1c8b3f1b010227dade0229a14ba8bd73aa	It sounds to me like your dream of raising your child up in a "stable and secure family" flew out the window a few escapades ago.  I'm sorry to point out the obvious sweetie, but you already know what you need to do.  If you are unhappy now -- while carrying this child -- it will only get worse.  Trust that!!  Your best bet is to go ahead and make a break now and start life with that precious life growing inside you, on your own.  The two of you will make it!!!  It will be tough, but IT IS do-able.  (Me and my daughter did it!!)  Just stay focused on what is really important -- the welfare of you and your unborn child -- and you will be okay.  I promise.?    I wish you the best of luck sweetie.  I will pray for the two of  you.  You deserve much better than what that idiot is offering you right now.  And one day.....you will have it!!!  ???    Oh yea, and by the way, congratulations on your pregnancy!!!  What a wonderful experience this can (and should) be for you!!!  Please try and enjoy it honey.  You are blessed.|`|JsqMSU9Haa	you can give him an ultimatum but he doesnt sound worth it - parents are usually right.  figure youre done with him; however, if you need time to figure out a plan for yourself and the baby, stay with him in the meanwhile but step out of the relationship emotionally little by little.  i assume he's been told to shape up or youre out - if not try that as well.  maybe your parents would help you if you left him? if you have no other options..|`|z0XRuVwSaa	i was in same situation as you 4 years ago i dumped my childs father . guess what i coped well and better than everyone thought . i met a lovely man who took on my daughter as his own we are now married with a baby on the way . you can do it too if you put your mind to it and get rid of that nasty man|`|yRlIXECTaa	Give him an ultimatum, Either clean up his act or you leave.|`|zkNotsePaa	get rid of him  if you want to bring up your baby in a stable secure family, you wont with him if this is how he is treating you already...without the added pressure of a new bub  good luck with your decision|`|qEWYC3qvaa	I get you wanting to bring your child up in a secure family... but w/ him having already cheated on you twice since you've been pregnant, Do you really think thats secure! what would happen if he was to bring something home to you... you aren't just looking out for yourself any longer!|`|99af71d6c2927cce636eb721484f7c4caa	I think you need to find out for sure and then act accordingly. I appreciate that having a baby is daunting in any situation (I'm currently expecting my 2nd in July), however, stress and upset during pregnancy is not good for you, you need to concentrate on yourself and your baby.     If the upset continues once the baby arrives he/she will pick up on it too and that's not a nice atmosphere for any of you. I think that in many respects being a single mother is easier than being in a relationship as there are only the two of you to consider in your routine. Are your friends and family there to support you?    If he's definitely messing you around then staying with him for the baby is a bad move as he will mess the baby around as well and if he doesn't respect you now that you are carrying his child when will he?    This is only my opinion and I don't mean to cause you any further upset but you don't deserve to be treated in this way.     Take care.   Love Sarah  ~X~|`|GjuRYsITaa	first of all you need to find out if he is, my usual trick is to through his fone for texts and stuff if i don't find anything there il go through his fone bill and any number i don't know, i ring it.  another one i do is see if he will take the bait buy a cheap sim card and txt him this is my new number don't put who its from just loads of kisses, and if he reapplies start being seductive then you will know your self what hes up 2, its hard to keep your gob shut i can tell you and last of all arrange to meet him and if he goes for it and gives the real you an excuse why he will be late then you will really know and when you do meet him do it somewhere really public and humiliate him|`|wbWqboTaaa	He's probably cheating on you. I think you should leave. Do you have any cousins or friends that could help you through your pregnancy, and living with your baby?|`|hvu6Z8dnaa	Ok, first of all if you dont trust him your relationship isn't worth anything.  He is not doing your self confidence any good at all and he is trying to make you insecure and from your posts its working.    Let me dispel some myths for you:    You wont be able to cope:  You will cope, you will find an inner strength and you will manage, unless you let him ruin you.    Your baby will hate you for being a single mum:  No, he or she wont.  It is so much more damaging for a child to be brought up in an unhappy home than with one parent who loves them unconditionally.    He loves you:  No he doesn't.  If he loved you he would not treat you the way you describe in your posts.  He would support you and give you strength and confidence, not try and destroy it.    In my opinion you need to kick him to the curb.  you, and your child deserve better.  That said you must give him the chance to be a dad, just because he is a bad partner does not mean he will be a bad father.  He doesn't have to be with you to be a dad to your baby.    Good luck.
R7w0uJbfaa	You could stop taking any pharmaceutical drugs of any sort, that would help a lot.    Not doing drugs, not smoking, and not drinking would also help.    If your "hubby" is of a different race than you, that could also be the problem.  This is especially seen with white woman that are involved with a black or Hispanic man.    Eating healthy natural foods to get all your nutrients would also help: fruit, vegetables, lots and lots of water, salmon, milk, eggs, 100% whole grain bread & rice.  Vitamin supplements aren't digested by the human body properly, so don't rely on them for nutrients, rely on natural foods.  Get more protein, very very very very very important.|`|1CryEnb3aa	I don't think there is a clear cut answer here.  If you both are healthy and all, it could just be bad luck.

It has nothing to do with your sugar levels So I would defineltly start seeing a different doctor!    http://www.babycenter.ca/pregnancy/grief...|`|u0udwkZQaa	Honestly, this is a very complicated topic and the doctor would be the best person to ask, perhaps a specialist in obgyn. Stress is a big factor physical and emotional. Biologically speaking, definitely seek expert advice.|`|79eRDIbXaa	Hey Honey I cant possibly tell you the answer to that. But don't give up honey - just think if you start trying now, you could have a little one by Xmas. Good Luck to you and sorry for your losses. xx|`|WvqRJow1aa	Train your mind to think positively in future attempts. It may not be the cure, but it helps. See a more experienced doctor who understands the trauma of miscarriages. They may have good counsel.|`|XsKXmXsJaa	Dr. can better advice you i think you must consult your dr in this matter, how to avoid abortion. Here r some usefull tips for getting pregnant fast.     Have Fun, Have An Orgasm  Youd think sex without the worry of an unwanted pregnancy would be the best time ever in bed, but just ask any couple whos been seriously trying to accomplish pregnancy about how un-fun it can become. You dont want to fall into this trap and lose your love of physical pleasure with your partner. Seek out sexual adventure in your home. Select different places, positions, times of day that break up the routine. Dress up, act out healthy sexual fantasies or read erotica to each other. Whatever works to get you turned on and increase the sexual good times will increase your chances of allowing your body to do whats its naturally supposed to do. And dont forget to orgasm!    Scientists believe that the evolutionary purpose of the female orgasm is to cause the uterus to contract, thereby causing sperm to be drawn up into the reproductive tract. Just yet another reason not to let your eagerness to conceive get in the way of your ability to enjoy yourself in bed. Did you know that a single orgasm is thought to be 22 times as relaxing as the average tranquilizer? If youre finding the process of trying to get pregnant more than a little stressful, an orgasm could very well be just what the doctor ordered. Worst case scenario with stress and sex: If youre continually stressed out, it can cause your reproductive system to shut down.    Take Folic Acid & Pre-Pregnancy Care Seriously  If you do have the good fortune to get pregnant fast, taking 800mcg. of folic acid daily can help prevent birth defects. Do not wait until youre pregnant to do this. Check with your doctor about getting other pre-natal vitamins and other over-the-counter medications that you currently take. If you smoke, stop (studies have shown that smokers are 30% less fertile than nonsmokers). Limit alcohol and caffeine intake. See your dentist for a checkup or a cleaninguntreated gum disease is associated with pre-term birth.    Know Your Cycle and When You Ovulate  If you have regular periods, then you know how many days your monthly menstrual cycle typically is. To determine the length of your cycle, count Day One on the day you start your period and count consecutive days from there until you start your period again (which is again Day One). Once you have the length of your cycle, you can pinpoint ovulation time, generally between days 10 and 14. Youll want to have intercourse on the days before you ovulate and during, rather than after. The egg is capable of surviving 12 to 24 hours after ovulationand if it hasnt been seduced by sperm at that time, chances are over until the next cycle.    A recent study conducted by researchers from the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences confirmed the importance of timing intercourse prior to or at the time of ovulation: all of the 192 pregnancies that occurred in the 625 couples participating in the study resulted from intercourse the day of ovulation or within five days before it.    Decrease and Manage Stress in Your Life  According to Alice D. Domar, Ph.D, a pioneer in the mind/body medicine arena regarding womens health issues, eliminating stress is helpful for improving chances of getting pregnant. Infertile women report higher levels of stress and anxiety than fertile women, says Domar. Finding ways to reduce stress, tension and anxiety can make you feel better and increase your chances of for getting pregnant fast. Domar is the narrator of the award-winning DVD, Stress & The Relaxation Repsonse Explained, available at domarcenter.com.    Know The Odds of Getting Pregnant Fast (but dont be ruled by them)  Your odds of conceiving in any given cycle are approximately one in four. Approximately 60% of couples who are actively trying to conceive (having intercourse two to three times a week) will conceive within the first 6 months of trying, 75% within 9 months, 80% within a year, and 90% within 18 months. But what if your over age 35 and freaked out that your chances are dismal? Dont worry, the statistics for the 35-plus woman conceiving are better than you think. According to the National Center for Health Statistics, you have a 96% chance of conceiving within one year if youre under 25, an 86% chance if youre between 25 and 34, and a 78% chance if youre between the ages of 35 and 44.    Take Your Temperature to Determine Ovulation  If your menstrual cycle is irregular and youre not sure exactly when you ovulate, one pretty reliable and standard method is to take your temperature upon awakening, while still in bed, each morning. Begin this Basal Body Temperature tracking on the 1st day of your period and chart it on your calendar. Keep track of the calendar and the thermometer by leaving it on the nightstand. If you are ovulating normally, your temperature may dip slightly just prior to ovulat
mAsQbiIgaa	Sounds like he has a fab diet!  If you google annabel karmel she has loads of recipes on her web site that you could try.      Squash:    I cook it in the oven as it keeps more of the nutients than if you boil.  Halve the squash and scoop out all the seeds and fibres.  Spread some butter over the squash and cover loosely in foil.  Put in oven for about an hour and a half.   Then once its cool, scoop out the flesh and puree if needed.    My baby loves squash (I had never seen one before I had her, let alone cook one!).  I puree it with apple and she loves that too.|`|0pX1oQAJaa	you bake squash, cover it in tinfoil and put it in the oven. when it's done, (15 minutes or so) take it out, cut it in half, get the stuff in the middle out, and mix it with a little butter. it's reaaaally good.  but you have everything covered, there really is no other food right now. he may be good at chewing, but don't give him solids until he's a bit older. choking is still a big risk.|`|AtnRHgBxaa	My daughter loves mashed potato with tuna mashed in with it.. or cheddar cheese, (it's really nice, what she doesn't eat I finish it off).  Sardines on toast is something my daughter likes too, but it's a pain getting every single bone out.|`|sTWfVt6Oaa	Fruit: kiwi (cut in half and scoop out pulp in little chunks)    As for the squash, there are a lot of types.  For the little yellow summer squashes, you can cook any way you cook zucchini.  For hard winter squashes like acorn and butternut, cut in half, scoop out seeds, bake pulp-side down on cookie sheets in 350 degree oven until they start to smell sweet and the skins are a little browned.  A fork stuck through the skins should enter easily.  Remove skins before serving and eat plain or with butter, salt, lemon juice, pepper, or sweetened with a little brown sugar.  And you can try spaghetti squash, too.  Cook the same way or boil the halves, until softened a bit (or very soft if you prefer).  When cooled a bit, scrape a fork across the flesh and it will separate in spaghetti-like strands.  Serve as you would pasta, or just with butter, herbs, etc.  My kids have always loved squash and all the Vitamin A in it is extremely good for them.  You can also peel the winter squashes (butternut, acorn, etc.) first and cook the chunks in soup, sauteed (though it takes longer than other vegetables), etc.      Other: whole wheat pasta, barley cooked well, quinoa, lentils, baked beans (or cooked some other way)|`|reO9Dgmsaa	Sounds like he is doing well!  Sophie began solids around 6 months and I had fun finding new things to offer her!  :)  You can offer steamed green beans, asparagus, and cauliflower.  Steamed edamame is great too.  Hummus with whole wheat pita is tasty and healthful!  I make rice and offer it to Sophie warm or cold; she is obsessed either way!  I remember I made a nice tender pot roast and gave my infant daughter the potatoes and beef chunks along with the carrots. She loved it!  As for fruits, try nectarines, kiwi, honeydew melon, and grapes.      Have fun!    For the squash, you can saute them if they are soft-skinned summer squashes (like the zucchini).  I like to peel and chop winter squash, then roast them until tender.  :)|`|YrK7S8xtaa	boil it, you can peel it before or leave it in the skin and take the skin off after it is cooked|`|PtoSxH6haa	boil it u can take the skin off or leave it on it tastes the same whichever way i would suggest to give your son some fish with peas n chips because with fish you can put any thing wth it , mash potato,vegtables,peas , chips etc      gud look hope u find some thing yummy

2EUwbXhtaa	My little girl is seven and i am going through the same thing with her at the moment.  it came on after christmas and she cries at night and sometimes when i take her to school.  She used to love school too and now does not want to go as much.  It is nice to know that there are other children out there who are doing the same kind of thing.  makes me think that mabe it is just a phase and that she will grow out of it.  i am doing just the same as you and am trying to reassure her that i will always be there for her and that she will be fine.  I also worry myself sick too, especially if i drop her off at school and she is crying.  I worry all day and she is always fine when i pick her up again.  I am sure that your little girl will grw out of it and that mine will too.  Just thought it may be nice for you to know that your little girl is not the only one who is going through this.|`|uP08b6K4aa	My daughter went through the same thing albeit she was a little younger, but nevertheless it may have been something that's happened recently that's upset her unconsciously or consciously about being left behind.    I enrolled mine in plenty of after school activities or asked her friends over as much as possible, it soon took her mind off anything that was upsetting her and with the classes she attended after school, gave her more confidence.    It's natural to get upset when your child is, we wouldn't be good parents if we didn't.  Just keep an eye on things and if all else fails, go to your GP and ask his advice, also keep in contact with her teacher to check there's no other problems that might be missed i.e. bullying etc.    Good Luck....it will get better, just give her lots of love and reassurance x|`|prqrQcd1aa	She may be going through a period where she is unshure of herself, it is normal for kids this age to do it. They start to understand things on a much bigger level. Just assure her that you are always going to be there for her no matter what. Give her a job to do around the house and then compliment her on how good of a job she did, compliment her when she gets good grades in school and any other thing you can think of. I do all of this with my 7 year old who is the same way, i give her a little more freedom to be independent and she is no longer so clingy anymore.   My child also was doing this when i wasn't able to spend as much time with her as she liked, so i made shure to put aside time to read to her, and play a game with her once a week and she is doing pretty good about the clingy stuff now. Find something that works for you and your child and she will stop. There could be several reasons for what she is doing.|`|0nIwKd5Uaa	Is she "clingy" in other areas or just at school?     If its just at school and the teacher would go for it. Make the teacher or someone within the school your daughters pen pal. A notebook and pencil. Someone whom your daughter can write to everyday. Just short notes back and forth to each other. My daughter had problems at that age at school and her teacher did this. My daughter began getting excited to go to school so she could show the teacher what she wrote, but she also looked forward to what the teacher would write back to her.     Not only does it make the child want to go to school, but it also helps with writing skills, and communication skills. My daughter loved it.|`|74zrwxPbaa	Hi Stormy, I can sympathise with you as my daughter was also like this. I think one way to handle it is to try and ignore it as far as possible. I don't mean ignore your daughter, just the way she is behaving. Perhaps 'Ignore' is the wrong word, make light of it might be better. Tell her you know how she is feeling and that you sometimes feel that way too but that it will pass and then change the subject. If she is confident with her friends, then maybe she is playing on your sympathies and making the most of it.  The only other thing I can say is that my daughter is now 30 years old and a very well adjusted mother of two, so no lasting damage will occur but I know how you must be suffering. Ride through it and it will come to an end. Hope this helps and good luck for the future.  silversurfer21.|`|pDGVTLoFaa	make a fuss of her and gives her lots of cuddles and reassurance she loves you and she is emotional but it will pass.No need to worry. x x
i5tOQGgFaa	Sure...consider adding glitter glue along your abc/123's to give it a more tactile approach.  You can show them how the letter/number is formed and let them trace the letter/number with their finger as well.    You can also do a letter/number sort since knowing the difference is a goal for most preschools.  You can have two boxes/bags (decorated with letters and one with numbers) and dramatically ask them to choose a card (have some upside down in front of them) and tell if it is a letter or number and drop it into the box.    It's also good to expose them into sound blending.  So maybe you can have pictures of some cvc words such as cat and use the letter cards to spell the word...You could go about it this way... show the picture of a cat and say the word "cat"...hmmm...who can tell me the sound you hear at the beginning.  /c/.  If they can't hear it...emphasize the sound.../c/ /c/ /c/at.  You can even do how many "word chunks" are in the word.  Clap out the word and count how many chunks in that word.  You can even make a chart and put that picture under the headings 1    2   3.  Back to spelling the word.  :-)  After they get the beginning sound...ask the the ending sound...or just sound it out yourself.  But some children are ready to listen for the ending sound.  Then move to the middle sound.  Then with a fun pointer point to each sound and have the children help you say the sounds /c/ /a/ /t/ then slide the pointer from c to t again and say the whole word.  cat.    You could have them write their names on a slip of paper or have their name cards handy and do a quick name graph.  Use your cards as your "baseline" and have the children show their name card to the class, point to their first letter in their name, and tell the group what it starts with.  Then they put their name above the corresponding letter.  When all the names are done you can incorporate your numbers by counting the number of names with each letter with the group and adding a number visual to the top of the column.  You can talk about more/less/equal...etc.    If you need a time filler you can put a sequence of alphabet cards side up on the floor.  Then have the children look at it for a bit and then close their eyes.  Flip one over.  Then ask one child to name the mystery letter.  You can "sing" your way to the letter if they can't figure it out.    You could lay the cards down on the floor or put on the wall and sing the song...  Tune:  Mary Had a Little Lamb  Find a letter that you know.  That you know.  That you know.  Find a letter that you know  and tell us what it is.    You can sort your letter cards by whether they have sticks, curves, or both.    You could have the children form the letters with their body...or if using the number cards you can have them find that many objects in the classroom and do a quick "sharing" as each group holds up their card, states what number it is and counts their objects.  You can even incorporate numerical order by having them go in numerical order ...putting their card up on a wall.    Lots of things you can do with "flash cards".  Good luck!|`|nrQijvMuaa	That's a great Idea Also what you can do is when you show each flash card you can have them say something like..(Example; you show the "A" flashcard and you have a kid in that class who's name starts with an a . You can say the "A" says ah" like Albert, alyssa, etc.. You know what I mean make them feel included)|`|jusp6AbKaa	i think its a great idea! im sure that will entertain them ... you just have too make sure they dont say anything bad like poop for p cuz parents will get upset
99af71d6c2927cce636eb721484f7c4caa	I have a Tomy Walkabout Platinum Monitor. It cost me about 100 (18mths ago) but is well worth it.     It's digital so no interference;   Baby unit has built in nightlight which can be turned on / off with parent unit;   Talk-back feature so you can offer reassurance if you don't want to go in to them (also v. handy for requesting help from partner downstairs such as 'bring me a bottle / calpol etc'!)  Both units tell you the temperature in babies room;  You can record the time of last feed on parent unit so that you know when you last went in;  Vibrating option if you don't want sound on and also noise activated lights so you can tell at a glance if there's any action!    The Tomy careline are also fantastic - I have had a couple of replacement bits and bobs (my own fault as we didn't pack it properly when travellng so it got damaged!) all free of charge and sent out very quickly. They're good with queries too!    I can't comment on sensor pads but would say that maybe they would cause more panic than they resolve, and what happens if the baby wriggles to other end of cot?    Hope this helps. Good luck!     Sarah    xxx|`|tZt7fUYYaa	I got a fisher price one with flashing lights, it has battery operated option and plug in option. Was only 20 from argos and works just fine. I dont see the point in the really expensive ones. My baby sleeps in her cot in my room so i only use it when taking a shower etc..its a really clear one and you can hear everything, just remember to turn it off when you are talking to your baby and someone is downstairs as i was singing to mine in the bedroom and my boyf and his daughter were downstairs laughing at me. I think it depends if your having your baby in its own room or if your keeping it with you for a few months.|`|hqogf9oGaa	Hello    My sister is a paediatric nurse and has advised me against getting a monitor with sensor pads.  They use them on her ward with the young babies and they go off for no reason - not only waking the baby but causing a lot of unnecessary stress.    In principle I think they are a good idea however, until they iron out the kinks I will be going with a monitor that allows two way communication with a camera so that I can see baby too.  There are some good ones on the market but I haven't decided on the exact brand yet.    Good luck!    Indigo    xxx|`|xy0W50Lqaa	Yes get one with a sensor pad!  I have been using the Tommee Tippee baby monitor with sensor mat for 12 months now.  I really couldn't live without it, never had any problems.  There is a switch for the mat so you can have it on low sensor for if baby is in a moses basket or crib and high sensor for when you use it in a cot as the mat has to cover more area.  There is a night light on the monitor and a switch for the alarm on the mat to be on or off.  All I would say is try not to put the monitor too near to other electrical plugs such as a mobile phone on charge as it causes interference and annoying buzzing.|`|u8Km1J3Gaa	In my opinion those sensor pad ones can cause you to be nervous, always checking them.    I have a fisher price monitor with the nightlight on. It cost 20 from boots and is great (I actually got it free by using the high street vouchers I got for setting up a direct debit on my daughter's trust fund).|`|mAsQbiIgaa	I have tommee tippee monitors and they work great.      I wish on hindsight though I had bought the one with sensor pads.  My partner felt I was being over cautious but I think it would have saved me alot of worry and constant checking on the baby when she was sleeping!  She sleeps in my room but it would have been helpful during the day and I might have slept better at nights!      I am not highly strung by any stretch of the imagination- i was just a very nervous at the repsonsbility of having a wee baby to look after!|`|N1IQuM1jaa	I have the tomy premier advanced, and get a lot of interference, especially if near mobile phones etc.  If was buying again, would definitely invest in digital ones. good luck with the birth!
pVWk12oOaa	Sounds cute!  But I agree with the first answer, it will be hard finding things that aren't birthday related.  But really, whats the difference?

iq5uwobOaa	Lets put it this way,  I have always thought I was a sexual person with my husband before pregnancy,     now I call him up on the phone while he is at work and tell him how much I want to jump him when he gets home.    So it is common to have an increase in sexual wants during pregnancy.  But I would not ever ask others to help me out.      She might have a fantasy you don't know about?????  Watch some porn.|`|WaU0hmD5aa	let me tell you this i'm going through that right now with my wife so when she wants it i give it to her b/c once she have the baby all the fun is over for a while so get the goods while the getting is good b/c it will all be over after while lol so i know what you are going through so go on and have fun and may God bless you|`|7vu3M1YFaa	Its a very common thing for a woman to feel like this - it is also just as common for a woman to be off sex. I have 2 children. With my first, I couldnt possibly do it in the first three months, but from the second trimester onwards I could never have enough.    With my second - the thought of sex made me feel ill. Guess its just one of those things.     I had a mate that was pregnant the same time as me. she was randy 24/7 and her partner wasn't. As I wasn't and my partner WAS, he joked that we should swap partners for a few days.    I know he was only joking but it really hurt to hear him say that!    I wouldnt say its anything to worry about - as long as it was sensible sex, and you's weren't swingng from the chanderliers when she was 8 months pregnant!!|`|uajQrEPQaa	Yes, your wife's feeling are quite normal.  I am in my second trimester and I feel the same way... Its very unnerving for me but I am always in the mood, Always.  Im not sure what can be done but my husband has no issues with it. ;)   Have a talk with your wife if you are worried so she knows to tone it down abit... but again its normal.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	Not for myself,quite the opposite actually. But some women do get a jump in libido in the 2nd trimester.|`|acj9mB9Paa	I have always had a higher sex drive than my husband but when I am pregnant....OMG!!!  I want him ALL THE TIME!!!  Unfortunately this time we have a 20 month old son and my husband is working a lot more hours than my first pregnancy.  Our son goes to bed at the same time as his Da, but it takes him a while to get to sleep, so by the time my son is out, so is hubby *sigh*.    Anyway, for me I think the heightened sex drive had to do with the fact that sex feels so much better when I am pregnant!  Every thing is more sensitive and orgasms are stronger.|`|98WKYtfwaa	Hey, it's completely normal and very common. Some women get more aroused than usual and others completely go off sex.    At the begining of my pregnancy i was up for it all the time, now i don't want it at all.
z31qxJijaa	I find the Tommy Tippee microwave steriliser is great, handy, small... only downside would be it only fits 4 bottles in at one time..  Otherwise its great, only cost me 15 on sale in asda!|`|mAsQbiIgaa	I have an electric one. I found it very handy initially.  The problem I had with it was the build up of lime scale.  I would descale more often than recommended but still found a dusty residue at the bottom of it after sterilising.    I now have a microwave one for sterilising dummies etc now my baby is older and I love it. So quick and takes up less space.    If I was having another baby I would definately opt for a microwave one next time.|`|130816e5bf662924b68497e6577df429aa	I use the Medela Quick Clean steam bags. They're around $5 for a box- I think you get 5 bags in a box. You just pop the bag in the microwave for 3 minutes and your bottles are sterilized.  Each bag can be used up to 20 times. I tried them with our first baby because my childbirth/breastfeeding instructor recommended them.  I loved them, so now I'm using them with our 2nd baby.|`|jPvXJ0Lhaa	Before my first baby, I was given both a microwave steriliser and an electric one  from two different friends. I tried both, but now I'm onto my second baby, I actually don't use either!      I use an old ice cream tub, with cold water and Milton sterilising solution (not the tablets).  It sterilises in 15 minutes, and you don't need to rinse the items afterwards.  You can also leave them in the water for up to 24 hours and they stay sterile.  I find it so much easier in the mornings for my breast pump as can have the tub in my bedroom, roll out of bed, and pump straight away rather than having to wait for the microwave to ping! (I pump from one breast while baby has breakfast from the other!).    It's MUCH MUCH cheaper, and sterile is sterile, however you achieve it!|`|xOr67VDiaa	its doesnt really matter as long as they are sterilized properly.|`|8uiH6iRbaa	i got mine from boots its an electric one    you put in the right amount of water in the bottom and then it steam's the bottles.    it was very easy to use and very reliable if i had another baby and had to buy another steriliser i would most defiantly opt for that one again !|`|CY8jAXPDaa	I had an electric from when my son was born, but it broke after about 9mos, and i have a friend that also had the same electric steriliser and hers also broke.   So personally i wouldn't advice them.   I bought a microwave steriliser, and i love them!  The bottles stayed sterile for longer.|`|tTf1Zp5eaa	Microwave ones are cheap, really easy to use and cant really break like electric ones do because technically they are just a fancy plastic container with a tray to hold your bottles in place!  I have the mothercare one and its been totally fine - nothing to complain about.    Also the steam it produces cleans the inside of your microwave!|`|50lIaC8zaa	Well i have always used a electric one, don't know why really i just prefer them, i suppose they are easier if your going away and the place u are going doesn't have a microwave and i personally have never liked the cold water ones.|`|Jet2E58aaa	Get the microwave one. My daughter used one for her two children and found it convenient, effective and simple to use. Why pay more for no real gain?|`|vIvNSHhVaa	definetly MICROWAVE    So easy just load, add water n ur done    Ive got Advent microwave steriliser n its probly been one of the best things as it can do up 2 6 bottles in 6 minutes....So quick and easy just add 7oz water thats it....    Electric ones take longer n use electricity as apost to micro....    RECOMMEND ADVENT MICROWAVE STERILISER BY FAR think about 25|`|uVuYdcRcaa	Hi,     I WAS thinking of getting one of these as they look good ...    http://www.mothercare.com/Ultimate-Colle...       But think I have change dmy mind and just get a microwave one as it does the job just as well and also you can take it around with you - so say your parents are babysitting, it handy for them to use. Besides it cheaper!!!    Lx|`|UMRdHuuVaa	I am amending my post after re-reading it.    I personally do not like the idea of using the sterilisers that u put in a microwave - they seem unsafe to me.  Hence why i boil my bottles - i refuse to use plastic bottles, as some of them when heated can leak some of the plastic into the milk.  I only use glass bottles, which i boil for 5 min on max heat.|`|xy0W50Lqaa	I have an Avent electric one so I can only comment on that.    They recommend that you clean them every 2 weeks with citric acid (sachets included) but the element still builds up with limescale.  Mine broke about 2 months ago and it isn't possible to take it apart to mend it.|`|PDAo1Z0Gaa	I had both (the Advent brand). I gave the electric one to my sister a couple days ago. The microwave one is so much easier to use, takes up so much less space, and takes a lot less time.The electric one isn't hard to use it is just more complicated and you are supposed to use distilled water. I have to say that is was a bit bigger, so if you wanted to sterilize other things it would fit bulkier items (I sterilize the containers that I make his milk in). They are both good, but I prefer the microwave one. I would really go with whatever you can find cheapest if $$ is a concern.|`|qYNCV6L1aa	I would recommend a microwave sterilizer. It pretty much cleans itself (not too mention your microwave gets a nice steam clean) while it's sterilizing your bottles and it's just a matter of placing your items in it, closing the lid, and setting the microwave. Does the same job as any other sterilizing method and is very inexpensive. Just make sure your microwave is big enough for it. I have a small microwave so I have to kinda tilt the sterilizer to get it through the opening lol. But it fits after that just very snug :) I've never used an electric sterilizer but I would imagine it would be a hassle considering how often you're going to be using it and having to clean it, etc.   And of course the free and easiest way to sterilize your items is putting them in a pot of water on the stove, bringing it to a boil, and letting it boil for about 10-15 minutes.
DDFSITiYaa	My 4 yr old daughter was getting ready for a bath one night.  She was kind of bent over, clothes off and wiggling her butt.  I said, what are you doing?  And she gets a grin on her face and says I'm flirting, Mom!  I said "WHAAAT?"  And she said, 'you know, flirting, when a noise comes out of your butt?"      Man, I can't wait til she is 16 and wants to 'flirt' and I trot out that story!|`|bYhqPOtwaa	My son was stalling last night at bedtime. We had to sing Twinkle Twinkle Little Star and You are My Sunshine, say our prayers, kiss, and BIG hug. Then he started saying "I need... I need... I need... umm...umm...umm..." And then he mumbled something. So I asked what he said. Another mumble, then "ELEPHANT PILLOW!" He just HAD to think of one more thing to stall bedtime.|`|0TGpz08paa	I was taking Emma ( my daughter who is 3 and a half to dance class ) and lately she likes putting on lip gloss and says it makes her lips pretty. So we're in the car and she says " Mommy...I forgot my pretty lips at home " and I said " Your pretty lips ?? " and she looks at me and says " Mommy, my pretty lips are at home " and I said " Oh your lip gloss ? " and she said " Yah , my pretty lips " it was so cute|`|sequZxauaa	my younger cousin who is 4 years old said each morning the sun is going up its moring time. at night she says the sun is going down its nap time. then she says i miss the sun i like dancing with the sun.when i was younger people were puting concerts of beyonce gonna sing crazy in love i said look mommy it's crazy right now|`|XOtOMncwaa	What a great question!     My son always manages to embarrass me somehow! I had people over the other day, and my son likes to dig through my purse (I usually put it up, but I wasn't thinking) So he dug through it, I was deep in conversation so I wasn't really paying attention, he then starts jumping around and running through the living room, waving a tampon out of my purse around for everyone to see!   Or the other day we went out to eat, we were on our way home and my son pooped (we were like a block away from home so I figured we would wait until we got home to change him) I looked in the backseat and he was a mess, his socks were ever brown, my fiancee and I were literally hanging out our windows gagging, (I've changed many diapers and have never gagged) and to top it all off my son was gagging so bad I thought he was going to puke! My fiancee had to carry him in car-seat and all!    And a really cute story, not about my son but my cousin, we took her to an exhibit to learn about the human body, and she was looking at the heart, and I explained to her that those things were heart VALVES, she said "oh were learning about them in school, A E I O and U!" Everyone around us was in tears we were laughing so hard! (she's 6)|`|s1utniuvaa	My 5 y/o daughter...she is a pisser...  She just found out I am pregnant with twins and now she runs around telling everyone that mommy got pregnant 2 times this time but it better be my last cause the house is getting too full lol... it is her, my older son, dad, me and 3 cats.    Last week she had her first loose tooth and the big tooth was growing in behind the baby tooth. I told her we had to go see the dentist and she turned to me and said "No way Jack! I am not going to the dentist mama-dukes" I had no idea where that came from and I started laughing so hard I thought I was going to wet myself.|`|FvYqKZSMaa	Well last night.Out of the blue Evan my four year old said Mommy I want a banana apple.I was like a what sweetie.And then he corrected himself a banana and an apple.He accidentally said them together.I had no idea what a banana apple is.    And David my youngest came out last night with my nursing inform on and my sunglasses with my shoes.He wanted to go to work with me in the uniform.But I was like David baby you have to put your own clothes on.I bought both kid to the hospital.Its more of  hospital with kids who are not sick.But need other help.So I can take them with me and  the kids are really god with them.|`|RXAEGB7kaa	when my son was little he said a funny thing.my sister used to live in a mobile home.she had a mop in a bucket my son said while is that stick drowning in a bucket ha ha.he was about two.|`|1KIwM1uOaa	when my son was three he tried to give the cat a bath by putting it in the toilet and flushing it about that same time we were at wal-mart shopping and he had to go pee so my husband took him into the restroom next thing I knew my son was off and streaking through the store and my husband was chasing after him with his pants and under ware.    Then when we were in mass one day my daughter who was about 5 walked up to the priest and asked him if he was a man why was he wearing a dress.    There have been so many I have them all on file in my mind for when they start dating!
848f75b2d80efbaf2e5e5b809911996faa	Talk to your daughter's school counselor. They have specialists available to help with behavioral problems. They will not only help her in school (anonymously of course), they will also be a good source of information as to what you and the rest of the fmaily can do to help her be her best. The sooner you do this the better it is for all of you. Even though this is your first experience with ODD, they're experts and see it all the time.  Good luck.
yrDqtazLaa	They will probably try to do an ultrasound on your stomach first before trying the vaginal one. You should be able to hear the heartbeat by then, and the technician will measure the baby and the sac to make sure there's enough fluid and to make sure the baby is growing alright. Your baby will be pretty tiny, but you should still be able to see a head and where the little body is. Good luck!    Edit: If you want to see a round-about estimate of what you'll see when you get your ultrasound, go to google and search for "10 week ultrasound pictures", you should get some good results from that. Good luck again!    Another edit: If you drink plenty of water and go in with a full bladder, you'll get a much better picture of your baby than with an empty bladder.|`|d678f8b7d26c1604273a818860d37290aa	Fun Fun! You will see a tiny baby form very small and not all the way looking like a baby but still so cute. You will see a heart beat, your yolk sack, the placenta is still forming, amiodic fluids the black stuff. Best of luck and have fun! drink lots of water|`|be8738c7b3a936fc2e865b3f0e6ad7d4aa	You will see a tiny baby :) and a heartbeat. I just had my fifth ulrasound (I am having a complication) and we got to see it move, it was kicking and waving and we even saw its nose. It was so cute!    Good Luck!    I am also ten weeks :)|`|66bc4129385331039e67c99220c312fcaa	I saw my baby, he was dancing :) We heard the heartbeat and we got 2 really great pictures. It won't hurt you or the baby. Just relax and take kleenex, I guarantee you will cry.|`|mc6YtaRbaa	Ultrasound done 8-20 weeks gestation you need to drink 20 ounces of fluid 1.5 hours before the exam. It makes it much easier to see the baby. I had my ultrasound at 11 weeks 4 days and it looks like a little mini person. In my pictures you could see him/her kicking her legs and stuff. My Dr. will do the regular ultrasound first and if they are having problems seeing the baby then they will do the transvaginal ultrasound. For my 7 weeks 4 day ultrasound the did the regular and then to get a better picture did the internal but the 11 week one was just the external. You can see the face, arms, legs, body everything at that stage.|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	You will see a baby and hear a heartbeat....what else do you expect to see?|`|zJv8LA5Yaa	I never had that type of u/s & didn't have any that early.  But I am guess the previous answer would be correct.  When I had my first u/s @ 16ish weeks, we saw the baby & they just checked to make sure everything was there (arms, legs, heart chambers, etc).|`|vqbmcg4Paa	you will hear the heartbeat, and you can see that tiny little baby floating and making your womb his/her appartment. gluck and enjoy it!!!|`|WSbfkuSZaa	I had mine at about 11 and it was very clearly a baby. We could see it bouncing around and its little hands "waving" at us. We held hands so tightly and I swear I almost cried because it was so amazing to see our tiny child right there :) You'll love it, although the vaginal ultra sound is really awkward.|`|98WKYtfwaa	I've not had a transvaginal ultrasound but i did get an abdominal one at 10 weeks 4 days. Maybe you should ask for this one, my baby was as clear as day, i could make out it's face & nose, see it's heartbeating away and see it's little limb buds (arms and legs). It was amazing.     Having a full bladder pushes your bladder against the womb so that you can see the baby clearer. It does help the sonographer get a better picture. They recommend a litre of water (4 glasses) an hour before the appointment. I know i didn't do this and they were a little angry that i didn't have a full bladder lol.|`|prq0Y1Jaaa	Hi for a transvaginal scan they ask you to empty your bladder! I have had a few of them, at ten weeks an abdoman scan should be ok. For the transvaginal scan they have a probe which they cover with a condom and and gel for it to insert easier, it's not pain a little uncomfortable that's it. You will see the starting of a proper little baby arm and leg buds and heartbeat. Good luck|`|GjuRYsITaa	http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?pid=30...    my scan at 11 weeks and 3 days|`|Hu9yquP4aa	heartbeat  yolk sac and little tiny zygote swimming around with arm buds and leg buds.

If he really likes you he will make his feelings obvious, otherwise don't push yourself on him.|`|E5CnUdhsaa	yes if you dont hes too immature if hes putting a difference in music taste in front of getting to know someone better|`|qOe0WX1laa	you should try   if he thinks that those who arent into metal are blehhh then obviously hes not a good guy    also if u despise his taste thats a problem too  but it doesnt sound like u do    just dont be a ***** and talk to him  maybe start to listen to some of his muic   who noes maybe u will get to noe him a  little bit better  also also odont dress like a slut but do show ur feminine side|`|bPft5g9baa	Its just music.  I know you are both young and it seems like that's important, but trust me when I say its not.  I like classical and my husband likes rock and roll.  He looks like a stoned out hippy and I ...don't.  Its just a preference.  And not even an important  one.      I say go for it hun.  You sound like a good person and he'd be crazy not to get to know you.|`|suXBBHkLaa	I don't think that it matters , if you like him, and you think that he likes you, it shouldn't matter how he dresses, or what music he listens too. you obviously like him for him, and im sure he likes you for you. But, you gotta take a chance, you never know. It coule be the greatest decision you have ever made, or the worst. But, if you don't try. you'll never know.
LbkLg4RFaa	Our favourite thing at the moment is playing chase with a toy lawn mower.  I usually start by pushing the toy towards him and he runs off (toddles off) arms flapping, giggling and squealing.  Then after doing a lap around the house we have to switch and he chases me with it and I have to wave my arms around and pretend to run away.  My son is 14.5 months old so does the real baby run and is so funny the way he toddles around waving like crazy while mummy chases him.|`|sAAnquoTaa	Well my fav thing to do with her is cuddle, but her idea of fun is quite different these days.

r39EDGhPaa	I only have a problem if:  1. They're on here asking who the father is.  2. They're getting a lot of financial help from their parents.  3. They just didn't use any protection.  And pulling out doesn't count.  4. They were drunk when it happened.  Oooh yay, you drink underage, AND you're pregnant!  What winners those kids are.  5. They're under the age of 16.    Not all teens are like you.  There are tons of bad teen parents, as well as adults.  But it's harder for a teen to provide for their kids, and people say it's not about the money, but money is a huge part of raising a kid.  You can't raise a kid on the streets, and make them wear the same clothes until they turn 5, can you?  Nah.  And in my opinion, you shouldn't be having sex if you're not even of legal working age.  If you get knocked up, the first thing you should do is run out and get a job.  If they can manage, then more power to 'em.|`|xOr67VDiaa	some ppl are judgmental, but alot of teenage parents dont look after their kids and just have no idea what the hell they are doing.. its not the fact how young you are, its the fact you shouldnt be wanting children at this age! its called mother hood, not children hood! its a very small % that the child actually gets what it needs, and when you hear stories all the time what else are you expected to think when you hear a 15,16 year old gets pregnant, in my opinion its scary because they are bringing a innocent child into the world, if you look after your child then good, so you should!! thats the whole point of having kids!!|`|ZQ0dRFoTaa	children should not have children.  oh, and one word:  STERIOTYPES.|`|mfBkH3qtaa	I so so so agree with you. Like okay yesterday i saw 2 sets of parents. Do you think you can figure out which were the teen and which were the 40 year old parents.    Set 1:  So I was in the grocery store. The toddler is crying because she can't have a donut. The mom is trying to quiet the toddler even though the crying isn't bawling and screaming. She tries everything she has in her purse to calm her down. About 5 minutes later she grabbed out her blackberry curve and let this toddler play with it, so the toddler would be quiet. This of course quieted her and i have yet to know whether or not the phone was broken. I know it worked because the mom was on it in another aisle.    Set 2:  I was in dollar general. This little girl was screaming VERY loudly, for this barbie doll. The parents told her no and she got louder. The parents then decided that the family would leave(mom dad and daughter). She was lagging back. The parents were walking very fast and yelled for the whole store to hear" IF YOU DON'T HURRY UP WE ARE LEAVING YOUR A-S-S here."                    Guess which was the teen parent? Set 1. There are alot of parents that are in there 20's 30's and even 40's and i have seen better teen moms than them. You guys have NO idea what it takes to be a teen mom. It takes ONE time to have sex and you could become pregnant.|`|ySKK7lCyaa	Tell me about it, having everyone judge you sucks. I hate it when people automatically think that i am a bad mom. When i am far from it. Yeah i get allot of financial support from my families but that was in agreement that i stayed in school. Which i am in and making honor roll. I did not get pregnant drunk and the only time i have ever drank was with my brother and his girlfriend. And i have had only one partner and i am still with him.When my daughter is sick i am the one staying up all night taking care of her, then getting her to school on time. If she can't be at daycare when i am in school i stay home with her. I don't pass her off to anyone. And people put a label on me that says bad mom but if they took the time to talk to me then they would know that i am just as good of mom as anyone.|`|IUQZFrMfaa	i try hard not to judge teen mothers. i do. and if they are doing a good job, i am really happy for them, because they may be doing a better job than prospective adoptive parents. in my school, there is a girl in 8th grade who is pregnant. supposedly  the father is her uncle. but i dont believe that. The school actually moved her to the high school (Which is literally 50 feet away from our school), so her teachers bring her her work. i guess they think that she's a bad influence on the rest of the school (5-8 grade).|`|GU3RauKOaa	Bad teen parents ruin it for the good ones. And there are a lot of bad teen parents, sadly.    Perhaps some people are just insecure when they see a teen doing as good of a job as they do as adults. Perhaps it bothers them to see someone younger who is just as good as a parent as they are working to be.    But not everyone looks down on teen parents, just some insecure, unhappy people do.|`|oQTjeOekaa	i for one do not look down on teenage parents. the fact that they decided not to abort the baby in the first place makes me look at them with a level of admiration and hope. i would never think of them as ignorant or unfit parents, but rather as young people who turned an unexpected pregnancy into a blessing. i would only wish them well wishes and hope that they'd raise that child well.|`|yRlIXECTaa	Mainly because of their age, They are teenagers...Still children...  You cant raise children, if you are still a child yourself.  Teenagers dont know what life is about. You may think you do, but you dont. Believe me, I am 23 years old.  I used to think I knew what life was about...but now..Im still not sure..and Im an adult.|`|AIGevX6jaa	Parenting is the same for a teen as it is for a 40 year old. Don't let people bash you for being a teen parent. My mom was one at 16 years old. Just make sure to make time for your child and be a part of his/her life. Who really cares what people think anyway. The only thing that should matter is you and your child. To answer your question, it's the same people that hate everyone else because that's all they can do to make them feel better about themselves. They hate their neighbors for having a nicer car. They're gonna hate you more when you kid is valedictorian and theirs dropped out in 9th grade. Don't let it get to you. Just take care of your sh1t.|`|IKgbbRVEaa	I 100% agree with you, I have a friend who practically looks after her brother and sisters, all younger than her, she does an excellent job and every time I look at her, I can't help but think, she was born to do this, she would make such an amazing mother, and do a better job than her parents are doing!|`|szVvf7Nkaa	There are a lot of bad teen parents out there but I never judge them. I always say that there is a story there that we have no clue about what is going on in their lives. And I think they suffer a lot because they didn't have the chance like some teen parents had. And yes there are many out there that are good teens parents. But we hardly hear about them because most people don't think that they are good teen parents out there. My friends neighbor has a daughter who is 16 and she had a child when she was 15. As a teen parent we can tell that she is a great mom. She goes to school and she has a part time job. But she also has support and a mom that love her and her child to death. But not all teen parents are that fortunate to have that kind of support.|`|iG0nAZKGaa	Many years ago women had gotten pregnant at a much earlier age,but life expectancy was younger,so it fine then.People live much longer today so people think teens have a whole life ahead of them n should work on themselves n life first.A baby does change your life forever....People who should not look down on teen parents though.....Teens are young adults n if they have a kid all they can do is move forward n raise tht child.|`|AH6Kqx4Iaa	THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS! *hugs* you just about made my day. =)
73193e3b067ba4736d1fab4da3289625aa	If he sleeps better with a bottle at 4am then give it to him. Some babies just need a top up during the night. That is just them. I wouldn't worry about it. You have the choice of not topping him up or him waking up earlier. My 3 children were all different. My eldest slept through the night. My middle son woke at 11pm and then slept until 6am. And my daughter needed a top up at 3am and then slept until 9. Don't worry so much about it just let him have it. It is hunger so I can imagine why he would cry for those few hours. Have you ever had water on an empty stomach? Not good. Perhaps your husband should stay up with him for those few hours that he is whining for food. Might change his opinion. Anyway I would say don't worry about it until he is well into the solid food routine and then he will have sufficient food in his tummy to see him through the night.|`|vI0WnAiOaa	give your baby the milk at 4am and be thankful he only wakes up that once for a feed. my almost 2yr old is up 3-5 time every night to have a breast feed still.  no dont stop, if he is waking then he needs it, if he is crying non stop then he needs it, dont deny your son of nourishment, just cause someone else thinks you should.  at 6 months milk is still his main scourse of food, and yes he needs all he can get.|`|hieQHR0daa	At this age he should be able to go through the night without a feed and I agree this is habit. The kindest way to break this habit is by gradually reducing the amount of milk you give him. Start by only giving him a 4 oz bottle for two nights. Feed him without eye contact or voice contact and use minimal handling in a darkened or dimly lit room.   The next two nights offer him 3 oz when you get down to 1 oz do so for two nights and you may find that he starts to sleep through of his own accord.  If he still wakes give him 1 oz of water. More water than that is not going to console him nor will it help him to return to sleep. You can offer too much water and you really want him to accept that it is night time and he should be sleeping not feeding.  Be patient, it will come.|`|692c8795f68a0ba95a0d09139d70c98caa	Maybe he is actually hungry, why assume its habit and take the chance of him going hungry.   I wouldn't take the chance and worry that he may be hungry, i know how it feels to go to bed hungry, its not pleasant.|`|GN8ky1wOaa	my daughter is 9 months and same problem! I've tried everything, except suicide! good luck!|`|Xt8708sSaa	Hello There,  Your son wakes up cuz he might be hungry. When do you feed him before putting him to bed at night? I have a 5 months old who goes to sleep at 10:30  at night after a 5oz feed and then wakes up at 3:30 or 4:00 for his next feed.and then 7:30 or 8:00 am. Its very exhausting but the reason he wakes up is coz he is hungry. As soon as he has his milk he goes back to sleep. My health Visitor also asks me to put him in a routine but I don't know how, I don't think I can force him to feed when he doesn't want to.    I think If instead of water you give him milk, he might go back to sleep. He is still young, with time his amounts of feed will increase and the gaps btwn the feeds would become longer and  he will sleep for longer hours. Good Luck.|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	I wish I could tell you... at around 7 months my son was in that pattern and then he got an ear infection and upper respiratory infection and we are back to getting up 3-4 times a night... at 8 months old! I'd love to get back to once a night again.|`|LMc23g9Maa	My son had his last night time feed at about midnight, then he used to wake up at 6am (like us).  Maybe you feed too early in the evening, you did not say.
aJLx0nhNaa	At six months my son was still waking for one night feed about half the time.  My doctor told me that this was a possibility at least until he was 9 months old, so I didn't do anything about it.  He started skipping them from time to time and now he doesn't seem to want it anymore.    Since the baby wants a whole bottle, to me that says that he is hungry.  Give it a little bit more time, he may just grow out of it.|`|AA11048627	summer still gets a bottle through the night we just leave it in her cot and she drinks it herself dont worry its normal|`|vKvNDPbDaa	it's not habit, it's normal.  just give him the bottle of milk he'll be fine.  all babies are different.  he'll sleep through when he's ready and not a moment before.|`|kz69zcQtaa	My daughter is almost a year and is in the habit of waking up at 5 am for a bottle.

This stage doesn't last long..... and he won't be like this when he is eating more solid foods. Good Luck|`|baI5G8yLaa	i say its normal!  My little boy just 7 months wakes up for a bottle at 6am EVERY morning!

HVXtd2Ryaa	I checked out Wikipedia for you, I won't go into detail because I'd just be quoting so I'll just post the link, it's quite amazing, I always thought that the highest recorded was nonuplets...|`|yRlIXECTaa	I think 7 or 8.|`|1pzMFpTpaa	I  am only going by memory here as we were reading up about this the other night at a friends house.    In 1976 (I think) a woman had 9 babies at once in Sydney (none survived past 5 days old) but as it was so long ago I don't know what fertility treatments were around then. She still holds the world record for the most in one birth as far as I am aware.     Another Aussie woman had sextuplets (6) in 1974 but I can't remember if she was under fertility treatment or not.     A doctor removed 15 underdeveloped foetuses from a woman's womb in the 1980's but as they were only 17 weeks gestation, (not even half way through the pregnancy) it was considered a "therapeutic termination" rather than a birth and it was not known if she used any fertility assistance.     There was a birth of quints (5) in 1897ish and I am positive that there were no real fertility drugs about then so i think maybe she holds the "unassisted" record so far.    UPDATE!!!  Quote  " Jan. 26, 2009: Octuplets born in California were the second time in history that eight babies born at the same time have survived more than a few hours, doctors said."    http://www.cbc.ca/health/story/2009/01/2...|`|LbkLg4RFaa	A set of decaplets were apparently born in Brazil in 1946.

hqogf9oGaa	Yes I had a laparoscopy in November 2007.  I know that everyone worries about operations of any kind but you really will be ok!  You won't have much physical healing to do although you will probably be tender for a few days afterwards as they expand your tummy using air and it can get a bit stuck - not only making you pass wind a bit more than normal but it can give you shoulder pain too.  Having said that, the pain is completely manageable and you aren't likely to need anything stronger than paracetamol.    We had been trying to conceive at that point for just over 5 years but I knew from a younger age that here was definitely some damage as my GP misdiagnosed a kidney infection over and over again and my whole abdomen became infected.    Anyway, moving on from there, in my circumstances I did have to have both fallopian tubes removed however that is extremely rare - they just couldn't repair them.  I met a very good friend whilst in hospital and although she had one tube removed they repaired the other and she had her baby on Xmas Eve (just past) so I guess it took around 3 months for her to fall pregnant after her op.    I know that it is extremely scary and daunting when you start out on this journey but try to stay as positive as you can.  There is a good chance they will look and find that if there is a problem it is easy to remedy.      I went on to have IVF in March 08 which was successful however I miscarried.  I then had Frozen Embryo Transfer in September 08 and am so pleased to say that I am currently 23 weeks pregnant with a baby boy.  I understand it is so easy to think that there is no hope but don't ever give up hope....medical advances are fantastic and you wil be a Mummy.  It may not be easy but it is DEFINITELY all worth it!    The best piece of advice I can give you is that if you think of a question, write it down so that you can ask at your next appointment etc.  I often felt that I hadn't asked enough questions to put my mind at rest and whilst you are in an appointment you are so focused on getting test results etc that you forget the things you wanted to ask.  Oh, and don't be afraid to call them back if you do remember something you wanted to know - that's what they are there for.    I wish you all the luck in the world and sending lots and lots of babydust your way.    Indigo    xxx|`|xjRCdRnxaa	Hey I had a Laparoscopy in Sept 06 to check for Endimetriosis primarily due to immense pain duting intercourse, exceptionally heavy bleeding etc etc etc. . .the proceedure was fine, i wasnt even really too nervous and I have never be put to sleep either, but i dont obviously remember a thing!  I was ncomfortable after and a bit teary, which was down to amount of Anathestic i had as apparently (not to concern you) i reacted to proceedure - though i remember absolutely nothing, if anything, good they were keeping me topped up lol! But i was very blaoted and just feeling sorry for myself!  I was signed off for 2wks though so got bit bored too.I didnt start trying then though, not til end of 07 - i was advsed all was well from Op, but my cycles got further and further apart til hitting 40-42days at a time, had bloods after about 8mths of TTC and they said doesnt look like im Ovulating, so been prescribed Clomid - though said they would have done a Lap first had i not had one, however, i due to have HSG (tubes dyed) this cycle - will be 5th atempt on Clomid - so bit angry notbeen seen as they are always too busy - so 2more mths of Clomid left then if nothing and tube still remain un-blocked after checking through the HSG - im not sure, i think it possible it will be IVF.  Its daunting and frustrting, when all you want to do is get preg but, be positive, someone else mentioned before me, with no tubes and 2 IVF's, she's now preg, so gives me hope and hopefuly you too!  You will be fine! I promise!  Best of luck  (Sorry for typing mistakes! - keyboards naff!!) x|`|LZ3BwE0baa	Hi love,   I had a lap in ocober as they suspected Endometriosis, which they found and cauterised as much as poss while i was sttill under, I also had a HSG ( both procedures known as lap and dye) which showed my tubes were clear. They due these together if there are fertility issues. I have been TTC 2 years so its pretty standard i think.    The october before i was diagnosed with PCOS (form ultrasound and bloods done as specific time of the month) they say my PCOS is not too bad as i am slim weight but with my mother of hell PMT and not ovulating i wouldnt say that was not bad myself!    I dont really have too much too add about the actual operation, what the other ladies said is true, at the time you feel terrible and sore and sorry for yourself (rightly so!) and it takes longer to get over than you think it will, i had 2 incisions as they had to treat the endo but if its just diagnostic you will just have the little cut in your belly button.    Just one thing, its lovely whien you are sent off to sleep from the op =) my doctor said ''heres a free drink on the NHS'' just as i was going under! lol Oh and when i woke up i had a terrble pain up inside me, this is where they insert a metal instrument to tilt your uterus to get a better look, talk about bruised =(    Now im just waiting for further surgery/fertility drugs with IUI/IVF..i have next appt in a few weeks so we will see.    Its not too bad,  just listen to your body, and get family/friends to spoil you when you are recovering. =)      I wish you all the best and hope that you get answers and successful treatment,   lots of love xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

jar8EIelaa	Your doctor can write an order for your husband to have a 'semen analysis' performed by a local laboratory.  The specimen should be a fresh collection, best collected at the facility...  but may be brought in immediately following collection if kept at body temperature.  Besides the count itself, sperm will also be analyzed for motility (movement), and morphology (size, shape, normal, abnormal - ie two tails, etc), , the semen will then be analyzed for viscosity (how liquid the semen is).      This test will answer many questions for you.  If there are no problems with his semen, it will allow you to begin further researching what else may be hindering pregnancy.  If he does have a low count or not enough ejaculate, you can begin considering options which may further enhance your chances for pregnancy.  Good luck!|`|xhkwqxSGaa	my wife met another guy :(|`|WLtsumGBaa	coffee increases sperm count.  tea decreases count.     its funny because as soon as my brother in law bought his espresso machine his wife got pregnant like a month later. and same for us =)    lol|`|MtC3CWZraa	You can't tell how much sperm a man is producing based on a visual inspection.

In order to ease your minds, maybe he could have his sperm count checked. Also, if you think his semen is unusual in any way - i.e. lumpy - then maybe that also calls for a visit to the GP, just to be on the safe side and to ensure you are both in the best position to be getting pregnant.    I hope this helps!|`|VLVxbY9Yaa	have a doctor check his sperm count, you can't tell a man's sperm count just by looking at it.

Your friend should have protected himself.|`|2MKvrydWaa	you sound like a child.u need to go back to school to learn how to spell.and u are a true idiot thinking that there is a way to make her get an abortion if she wants to murder her child it's on her then.but u can't tell her to do with her body.|`|SBnFyxP7aa	If she doesn't want the baby email me I'll take it. my husband and i have been trying to have a baby for 2 years and we can't afford IVF. Give it to me I'll give it a good home. Don't tell her to KILL it!!!|`|0XGzD1PGaa	that's wrong to kill a baby its her decision whether to have it or keep it she is the woman its in her body so he could either step up and be a father to the baby or just look like a dead beat father he laid down and had sex so there for its time to take care of whats coming out|`|yZkf3zFeaa	That's rather stupid. Honestly. She most likely would have the child to piss him off, bet you didn't think of that. Either way it doesn't matter maybe he shouldn't have had sex. Basically if she wants to keep this baby she will do so no matter what he does and he will end up paying for it. Too bad so sad.|`|dq3rEMiaaa	Wow...this sounds like a terrible situation.  I would recommend you try to persuade him to go speak with someone older and more experienced, be it a parent, teacher, or maybe even a doctor.  I would not try to persuade the girl either way...it is a very emotional and difficult choice either way.  You can help by being supportive of your friend, and if you are so smart, try to find resources in your area that help those in a situation with unplanned pregnancy.|`|tJdXp6vgaa	She wouldn't get an abortion. She would keep it to piss him off. And you must be young if this is all because he doesnt have a car yet. If i knew where you were Id come beat the heck outta both of you.|`|mVXBOI6Qaa	You CAN'T persuade a girl to get an abortion.  That's like trying to persuade a man into getting one of his testicles removed or something like that!|`|wRvYyXZLaa	yes great plan and your the smart one of the group god i bet your all brain surgeons or something super smart idea and just for future Reference smart not smrat|`|UC8Qbwibaa	Restating your question in simpler terms may help you to answer it for yourself.    How to persuade my friend's girlfriend to murder her child to make my life easier?    butt the hell out and stay away from the kid.|`|GzVtNg06aa	I HAVE FOUR THINGS FOR YA----GROW UP,LEARN HOW TO SPELL,GET A JOB AND GET A LIFE!|`|AA11437384	first off... you're "friend" is wrong for not using any contraceptives in the first place.  SECONDLY your "friend" is a complete d0uchebag for trying to force his girlfriend to get an abortion and avoid the responsibility of his mistakes. he needs to man the hell up, get a job, continue his education, and raise that child with his girlfriend so SHE isnt ten kinds of screwed. at least she has the morals to not kill her child, her creation, even if it was an "accident".    Thirdly... your an a$$hole for suggesting that and you should be slapped repeatedly... if you were my friend and suggested that. i would have beat you down on the spot and disowned you.    If you did that after you impregnated a girl everyone would see you for the scumbag that you really are for not manning up.  sure people will be mad at you for doing something so stupid as impregnating a girl by "accident" but at least they would see you as someone they could trust to do the right thing...     you should be ashamed|`|r13mIG1Caa	Ur that bored to stir up the pregnancy section on Easter... Really????  I hope eventually you can meet some friends and get a life lol...    but thanx for the 2points|`|Jg043P0Eaa	Ur such an @ss|`|xnhwmontaa	your the smrat one the group? lol yeah I believe that one!!|`|AA10820533	You guys are terrible when it comes to feelings.  She will keep the baby if she wants and not much he can do about it.|`|jwboSl1Qaa	You're the "smrat" one huh? Definitely doesn't sound like it, mind your own business.|`|LVtowcW2aa	HE got her pregnant. its HIS baby so HE needs do deal with it. its NOT YOUR business.|`|AA11724307	Actually "Oh Smrat One"  if I were that girl and in that situation I would think that him flirting and ignoring me would mean he didnt want the baby and therefor having an abortion would make him happy, not pissed off.  I would also never have an abortion just because some immature guy who cant take responsibility for his actions wanted me to.  If her being pregnant is unacceptable then he should have kept this pants on.
AFxOZ0Hxaa	Apparently b/c LH isn't really processed until late morning (rather than your first urine). That being said, I always do my OPKs in the morning because I drink water all day long (and otherwise my pee would be diluted!)|`|mc6YtaRbaa	It will not give you an accurate reading. It will not show when you are actually getting ready to ovulate. The best time to do it is between 12pm and 5pm.|`|0Qiscnkeaa	You should not use an OPK in the morning because you do not want to use FMU. My OB told me that the LH surge is typically detected in the afternoon so test then and test at the same time everyday. I do test twice daily about the same time just in case I miss the surge.
i557GwTuaa	Nothing, just try to relax.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Nothing. You can't force a period to come...|`|8Xu0A70Saa	Pineapple fruits to induce but not to force period come.|`|Ws1hky6Zaa	nothing|`|6XR6ajTraa	no food just medicine
AA11763588	Stop stressing.    Stress can delay a period.    There is no solution to make your period come.|`|627pWyVkaa	stop stressing it will delay your period. Don't have unprotected sex anymore. And I\m pretty sure its illegal to test woman if they are pregnant or not because that would be, being discriminatory against pregnant woman. So I would get in touch with someone that knows those laws better because they can not test you for pregnancy. Also You can't do anything to cause your period to come. Test in a week or two with a pregnancy test to see!|`|zXPJ38eJaa	dont worry yet! You are most likely not pregnant after just one time. If you are pregnant then you will have to decide what is more important to you the baby or the job. You can always have a termination if you really want to. Stress can deylay your period so try not to worry about it or it might make it worse. Until your period is late tho there is nothing you can do sorry|`|XsKXmXsJaa	If you don't want to get pregnant then you must consult doctor in first preference. So she/he can advice you what to do.     Normally, pregnancy chances are more if you do sex in save period.
wENdWT5kaa	I'm sorry about your miscarriage, but honestly, i think its you.     I don't think she did it on purpose. She may have not realized what she did.     You can't and shouldn't expect her not to talk about her pregnancy because you had a miscarriage. She's excited is all. I'm sure she didn't do it to throw it in your face.|`|c2YcBbXyaa	i don't think she's purposely  doing it to hurt your feelings....more like she's so excited about being pregnant that she' just not thinking about your situation and how you're feeling|`|6XR6ajTraa	I know what you mean and how you feel. I've had a miscarriage and it was the most painful thing I have emotionally experienced. It is so hard and people don't realize how cut up you are because they aren't you and don't know how you are feeling. It took me a year to get over my loss. I blamed myself for a long time. You need to grieve for your loss in order to get over the pain, you will never forget it though, and you shouldn't. Your friend is just thinking of her little one, like you are of yours. But in two totally different ways. She probably hasn't realized and wouldn't of meant to hurt you surely.|`|LTD0qL6Yaa	Well i think she most probably didn't mean to hurt you but i do feel it was very insensative of her. You are feeling really down at the moment (for very good reason) and you probably took it way more personally than it was intended. Truth be told your friend probably sent it to the 4 of you at one time without even thinking about the way it would make you feel. Keep your chin up and be brave, i am very sorry for your loss but i think you might get more happy news in the near future. Baby dust to you.....|`|LMc23g9Maa	It's normal to be a bit jealous, actually the word is envious.  She's not insensitive but some pregnant women do live in a bubble and don't realise!|`|373b04f6dbf649a6ef357e85b32df3e4aa	Hey huni.    I am very sorry to hear about your miscarriage. I also miscarried, 9 days ago - I was 19 weeks.     Although I can not really help you in feeling better around pregnant women, I can tell you that it is normal to feel that way.     My best friend is 9 months pregnant, I love her to peices and I really am so happy for her, but it doesn't half kill me when we talk about her baby kicking and things.     I started to ask her about her pregnancy, instead of her telling me, I really found that helped me. It is hard to miscarry and yes we do become very jelous of other pregnant ladies, but just remember you will be one of those ladies again one day! :)    That thought is what keeps me going :) I work on a labour ward too so I really need to think like that     Feel free to email me if you are feeling down at all. I know what you are going through    EDIT: I also agree with the other answers, I would not have emailed that to my friend had she just lost a baby. Maybe she is insensitive, or just doesn't realise. Talk to her - Good luck xxxx|`|mzFUWq8iaa	i dont think she was trying to rub it in. she probably just has "baby brain" and didnt think before she sent it to you. and anyways if she is such a close friend shouldnt you try to be happy for her. good luck|`|iq5uwobOaa	I would have thought twice before I would have sent that to a friend that just had a loss.      But remember she is also excited about being pregnant and might not be thinking about others.    You have every right to feel upset about it, but I would just brush it off.  and let her know that if hurt your feelings.     She is your close friend and she will understand and try not to do that in the future.    I am so sorry for you and I know it is hard.|`|AA10176537	you need to think of other examples of her being insensitive or not to you and then decide. I mean that she is probably so happy about being pregnant that she gets carried away and mentions this all the time.  And i guess that you are more sensitive than usually due to your loss.|`|vIvNSHhVaa	Yes it is abot insensitive.... bt maybe she doesnt realise,Shes happy because shes expecting maybe didnt even enter her mind her was pregnancy orientated she just excited.    I had a miscarriege years ago n u u have u deal with the miscarrage sum ppl r selfish n think oh it wasnt a baby it wasnt here etc  I kept it in the back of mind moved house,new car etc then months later i brokedown as i didnt deal with it..  Pls do what u feel to grieve for ur baby thats whats needed n bear in mind ur friends excited|`|yvQpQjv1aa	you poor thing. i am soo sorry for your loss. ;( . in regards to your friend, i dont think she would have done it on purpose, but at the same time if that was me, there is no way i would have sent that to you. i guess some people are more sensitive than others.|`|1pzMFpTpaa	I have been on both sides of this equation before and although you have every right to feel upset, I feel that she is just so excited about her own pregnancy that she hasn't even realised that yours is still paining you. Also, women who have never had a pregnancy loss commonly do not understand that the grief lasts well after you appear to be "over it" (as if that ever happens). It has only been 3 weeks and your grief is still raw. You need healing time.    Unless your friend has a habit of being deliberately insensitive or is just a b**ch, give her the benefit of the doubt. I felt guilt ridden over becoming pregnant and I found it incredibly difficult to be excited about my pregnancy when someone close was still TTC and another had lost a much wanted pregnancy. But I felt much worse the year before when I was the one miscarrying and everyone around me seemed to be reproducing out of control.    You know you would not do it to her but maybe that is because you know how bad it feels first hand and she just doesn't realise it still hurts like hell and everything feels like salt in the wounds.     Your miscarriage has made you much more in tune with other people's feelings and maybe that was your baby's gift to you.     I am very sorry for your loss and I hope that you achieve a full term pregnancy soon so you can feel the excitement once more.|`|bH1DYr5saa	I don't think she would have done something like that on purpose - but yes, it was a bit insensitive. She's obviously excited and caught up with her own pregnancy that she didn't think about what she was saying, and that it would hurt your feelings.  It's very sad what happened to you, and I'm sure she sympathises, especially since she is expecting herself. Try not to feel jealous towards her though as it will just cause a rift between you both. You'll be feeling upset that she was insensitive to your feelings, and she'll feel upset because she'll think you're not happy for her, etc,etc. As upsetting as it was, I think you have to let it go for the sake of your friendship.    xx|`|fNE7Q7e8aa	I feel for you..    I had a "misfortune" last year and it was  hurting me. Inside and outside.    Everytime I saw someone pregnant on the street  I felt down.  Everytime I saw a TV program and heard the word  "baby" or "pregnant" it almost killed me.    Though I do not have any pregnant friend who does  like that, I think it's natural to feel the way you do  if you had a "misfortune".          Tons of baby dust to you!! xo
1c498d03fe9bb2e8719c81fe361b9912aa	because i didn't want to take tablets when i was pregnant, i ate lots of liquorish sticks and that done the trick, just thought i would let you know :)  good luck and congrats|`|1CryEnb3aa	Colace.  You can buy this over the counter.  It is a stool softener and totally safe to take during pregnancy.  I took the entire pregnancy.  It will take up to a few days to kick in.  Your body will go back and forth with constipation, just take the entire time and you shouldn't have to struggle.  Also, try prune juice or apple juice to help.  Good luck|`|StxCHnTkaa	Colace works well, I was prescribed that for one of my pregnancies so it's safe. With my second son, I ate fiber cereal in the mornings and that worked well too...|`|0OTV0a4Zaa	i think your allowed to take laxatives but check on the pack before you take them or even ask your doctor,just to be safe.  another thing that can really help is drinking warm water with lemon juice, it's softens everything up.  try to flush out your system with heaps of water.  sadly constipation is a normal part of pregnancy.  good luck and congrats.|`|W1JSp0blaa	take stool softner tablets  .. just go and ask ur pharmacist about it   there are many differnet brands available over the counter  also try Metamucil (powder form) 1 glass a day that really helps|`|79eRDIbXaa	There probably is something to take as you are on the 12 week mark now however I would seriously check with a pharmacy or doctor that it is ok. You have to be really careful what you take in any stage of pregnancy but even more so in the first trimester. Good Luck xx|`|iq5uwobOaa	drinking more fluids will help.    but you can take these Items (but with like any medication you should consult your doctor first)    Constipation    Pericolace/colace  Milk of Magnesium  (MOM)  Senokot  Fibercon  Metamucil    I know that constipation sucks during pregnancy we all have it.  I have found the intake in fluids help more.    For the Morning sickness try these items  Vitamin B6 50mg  (1 tablet 4 times a day with meals and at bedtime)  Dramamine as directed  Emetrol as directed  **can try sea bands**      Good luck and congrats  It is going to get easier soon.  It did for me|`|AA11085011	Eat more fruit and drink more water.    Avoid Aspartame! It is linked with Birth Defects.|`|Br5o28YVaa	i had severe morning sickness and had to go to my GP as a result as i could keep nothing down, this resulted in me becoming weak and passing out! My GP gave me cyclozine tablets which stopped the sickness,    i really couldn't see past the morning sickness but after 15 weeks i felt great so keep your chin up it will pass soon|`|e583cebee349ef9a997c192a1abad42aaa	The constipation is also caused by your systems becoming more slow ad sluggish in order to give your body time to absorb as many vital nutrients as it can.  However prolonged constipation will have a bad effect on your overall health, not to mention very painful problems like anal fissures and heammorrhoids.  Despite your sickness I would really try fruit juice, especially prune, grape and orange juice.  Grapes are also relatively easy to eat when feeling sick.  If things continue you will need to go to the pharmacisit to ask for a laxative safe to use in pregnancy (many are not) such as lactulose, which comes as a syrup not tablets.  Hopefully you are taking pregnancy vitamins if you can't eat fruit or veg, so check these don't have large amounts of iron in, which will contribute to the constipation - try switching to a brand like pregnacare with lower iron levels.|`|cPlDc7I1aa	Fybogel - it's a high fibre drink that keeps things moving naturally (as opposed to laxatives that hurry things along!!) My doctor prescribed it, (or you can buy them over the counter, but its cheaper to get them on prescrip and you get a bigger box) when i was pregnant with both of my sons  You get a box of 30 or 60 sachets and you mix one sachet (powder) with a glass of water and glug it back. Tastes ok (orange or lemon) but its a bit claggy at the end so you just need to neck it quick.  Took one in the morn and one last thing at night and it just keeps you regular.
C22jeMVhaa	I have a shy child. I would have loved to hear how she was interacting with other kids. New friends she made, what they played together, etc. I'm a stay at home mom and that's the only reason I put my child in daycare. If I had had a teacher who was more willing to share the thngs you are talking about my little one probably would have stayed longer. Keep up the good work!|`|60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	How well he ate  If he slept (if so, well?)  Funny things are always great to hear after a long day  Any behavior problems  In general, if he had a good day or an off day    I don't really understand why a parent wouldn't be interested unless they are in a rush and you are trying to carry on a friendly conversation that doesn't pertain to their child.      I can't think of anything that I wouldn't want to know about.|`|xOr67VDiaa	YES i cant wait to ask my 6 and 4 year old how their day went, it makes me excited and i just love hearing them tell me, mommy i did this mommy i did that, i just love it so much.. but thats just me.|`|5ZvALiclaa	i like to hear all of those things! Especially about who he played with and what funny things they do or say. Plus i like to know if they slept and for how long and if they seemed settled or uneasy.     i like listening to my sons teacher tell me what he did but maybe some parents don't seem interested because they are in a hurry to go home or the kids are distracting them. My son always runs out of the room and down the corridor so i'm trying to go catch him and can't always listen attentively like I would like to.     At my daughters old daycare they each had a book that detailed what they did, who the played with, when they slept etc...so I could always refer to that and then ask my daughter about her day.    you sound like a lovely teacher to be concerned about this! The kids in your class are very lucky|`|dDVAUA9saa	My daughter is 22 months old and attends daycare full time.  I always ask about how long she slept, how she ate and her general mood.  There are other things I would love to know but don't ask because the caregivers are usually busy when I pick her up and I doin't want to take too much of their time or seem unreasonable, but I would love to know what activities she did (not everything, but for instance if she did a painting or went for a walk), who she played with, if she cried for any reason or got in an argument with another child, etc.  But they don't usually volunteer that information.  I would love to know what funny things she did or said, they sometimes tell me that.     When she was in the infant room they always told me what she did that day, any new milestones, and reported anything remotely unusual.  They also kept a daily journal of her day (what activities she did, funny things she did, what she ate, when she slept, etc.).  I still have these pages!!|`|vI0WnAiOaa	i cant believe a parent wouldnt want to know everything their child does at daycare, there would be more to that family than what you see and it cant be good.   personally i love to talk with madies cares and find out what type of day she has had and everything she did while i was gone. just to know she has had a really good time is the main thing to me.|`|P25GuvNjaa	I like to hear what he has had to eat, the things he has said, the funny things he has done, like demanding they put bob the builder on the stereo!  The things they have been doing all day, everything really, I love to know what he had been doing without me it really suprises me that some of the parents at your daycare dont seem interested, they might just be tired and cant wait to get home!    There is nothing I wouldnt want to hear!|`|uZnnCjJ0aa	i can explain it a bit more personally just email me if you want me to   i will be happy to help with this sort of problem!
E08qVHNuaa	My doctor told me I should gain 12kg, no more, no less.     I'm in my 5th month and I've gained 3 kilos. I don't think that anyone can say "Gain this, don't gain that." All women and all pregnancies are different. Do whatever feels good for you, and don't worry about your weight. :)|`|AA11763588	Use this site:    http://www.babycenter.com/pregnancy-weig...    It will tell you about what you should be gaining per week.|`|5ZvALiclaa	you are totally ok!! I put on over 25kg with my first, 16kg with the 2nd and 18kg with my 3rd. And I lost all the weight again.     The average is around 10-15kg so you will be fine. With my last pregnancy, bubs is nearly 7mths now, I had put on 3kg by 20wks but then jumped up like 4kg in the next 4 weeks but the majority of the weight is put on in the last 2-3 months.     You are definately on the right track so don't worry. The doctors expect you to put on about 1/2 a kg a week from now on so don't worry, you're doing fine|`|uhj76Fkpaa	the top weight that you should gain is 10kg. I gained 8kg with my first,2kg with my second and 4,5kg with my third and I assure you that they were big and healthy babies!|`|79eRDIbXaa	Well that's sounds fine to me - that's about 6 and half pounds so like half a stone. I mean I have only gained 2 pounds - Im 20 weeks on Sunday but I had bad sickness and lack of appetite up to a couple weeks ago. I did loose 4 pounds. Good Luck and Congrats xx
X0xHXDcTaa	With my first child I didn't feel movement til 25 weeks. It's completely normal not to feel anything yet! With my last two I felt them move a little earlier, but it still wasn't til about 20 weeks. You have nothing to worry about!! If you saw him on the u/s then you know he's fine :)|`|aTk0A9SHaa	Its usually around this time you will start to feel movement  are you a very active person because if so you are less likely to feel the movements but they will get stronger and more frequent as the pregnancy progresses|`|Wps4XuqHaa	Because this is your first baby the movments arent as easy to feel, its normal to feel 1st baby move around 20 weeks x|`|79eRDIbXaa	Hey Im 19 weeks 4 days. I felt my baby move round 16/17 weeks. But however they say you will start to feel it move between 16 - 20 weeks so give it another week or so. As long as you know your baby is fine I wouldn't be worried. Congrat and Good Luck xx|`|P25GuvNjaa	I felt my first baby at around 16 or 17 weeks and my second at only 14 but I was concerned as I couldnt feel her moving around much and my midwife told me that some people dont feel their babys moving around until 24 weeks!  You will probably just all of a sudden start getting kicks and punches, your baby sounds as if he is sleepy, he will just be taking it easy just now!|`|zXPJ38eJaa	They generally say about 22 weeks but dont worry cos your scan was fine so maybe the baby is just lazy lol|`|A68od1sbaa	my friend was in the same boat. she had the at 19 - 20 weeks scan, found out she was having a girl, and still didnt feel anything for another couple of weeks after.  The midwife said it could be her baby was far at the back which was the case for my sister so she hardly felt anything until near birth.    dont worry. As you said everything is fine. just remember these quiet days when your baby starts keeping you up at night jabbing your ribs!! lol xx|`|vqbmcg4Paa	it`s normal not feeling him by now, i felt mine by the 21st week or so, so don`t worry it`s very normal. when i was 17 weeks preg i spotted brown a little bit after sex and i was worried i went to the dr and made an ultrasound and there she was moving hehe and the dc told me you`re not feeling her?? and i told him no ( as if i felt her i was going to make an ultrasound) and i told him should i be feeling her moving by now? and he told me no it`s normal you dont feel her movements by now. he told me just wait till you`re in 20`s. so dont worry enjoy your pregnancy gluck|`|1bnhwGACaa	if this is your first it could be a few more weeks   the baby is only 6 inches  just wait till this baby kicks you hard then you will feel it all the time|`|1CryEnb3aa	Any where from 18-20 weeks.  You should be anytime.  Have you noticed any flutters?  That is what you will notice first.  As he gets bigger, than it will get stronger then just plain mean! LOL  Seriously, don't stress.  Good luck|`|xOr67VDiaa	youre still at the early stages of pregnancy, i didnt really feel my son till i was around 25 weeks pregnant, i felt little flutters but not so much as a kick or a punch, dont stress it will happen and it will happen heaps. its just the strength of the baby.. as it gets bigger the movements get stronger.
AA11763588	If any sperm touches the vagina you have a chance to get pregnant.|`|8b96e3040c5552a5ae7c3bdd523c1c0faa	Only in case    Sperm enters the vagina.     and it is somehow able to get to an egg|`|Zo6TQY6haa	Of course not! The only way you can get pregnant is if semen somehow finds its way into your vagina. If your vagina was ejaculated on, then it's a slim possibility that semen got inside of your vaginal canal.|`|OHs8yJiOaa	If sperm is somehow able to get to an egg, yes.    If it's all ending up on top of your head or something, then it's unlikely it's going to get to an egg, so doubtful.    The odds depend on where it's landing and if you're getting it cleaned up, too. Go sit on a few drops that spilled and you get a maybe.|`|BQYXgtq7aa	The baby is formed by semen (from men's sperm after he ejaculates) mixing with a womens egg or ova and fertilised. If any sperm got inside you (which is mildly possible) then you may get pregnant.  Any kind of sexual activity between a male and female, should be thought about beforehand and you should always use protection like a condom.   Sperm and semen can be produced by pre-*** (before the actual ejaculation but due to the man being aroused).  Best bet is to go see your doctor for a morning after pill (must be taken within 48 hrs) and take this as a lesson learnt.   Use protection next time.  The only absolutely positive way not to get pregnant is to simply abstain (no have any sexual contact)....|`|rnUr1JJ7aa	if the sperm didnt hit the vagina your not pregnant|`|foHdMnI9aa	no|`|Cp8Y0cHcaa	Only if it happened on the outside of your vagina
3qI1oyFaaa	Just take a urine sample, check your vitals (weight, blood pressure, etc.) and they'll listen for a heartbeat. They'll ask if you have any questions, answer them if you do, and then send you on your way!!    Congrats and good luck!!
P25GuvNjaa	There is a very small chance but it can happen, a girl I know fell pregnant on it, I dont know if she maybe had unprotected sex before it had time to take effect or if she was late to go and get one of her injections, it can happen though but it is extremley unlikely.  I have been on it for a good few years and it has never failed me, I came off it twice to have my babies but I found it very reliable, I will be going to get it again when I have had this baby.  I was really bad at using other methods of contraception, especially the pill, I just could not remember to take it so depo was perfect for me.|`|sk46uigvaa	I doubt it, women are often left infertile for a long while after finishing their depo shot! myself included!

BuztPXvDaa	every city|`|DAmUAmPnaa	Try Pharmacies. They might have it.|`|rUnwBQ6oaa	All cities. If in chennai, Check naidu hall. I have bought there. They have lots of varieties, shapes and colors !|`|vIvNSHhVaa	google it|`|TklfCPh6aa	I googled it and am finding nothing as to where to buy cloth diapers in India. Try an Indian forum. Maybe some travellers know. Indiamike.com is a good site. I think maybe they use torn material like sarees for their diapers. Good luck!
r7q8LW7Aaa	I totally understand how you feel - the exact same thing happened to me. I moved to the UK for my hubby and fell pregnant within 3 months. I felt like I had no local friends of my own because it was all people I knew through him, and I also couldn't drive (I had never needed to) so was suddenly living in a small town, with no transport anywhere further and no-one to talk to. I couldn't work - who wants to hire a pregnant woman? And anyway, I planned to be a stay at home mum when the baby came.   I did have a long and lonely pregnancy, but as soon as the baby was born, i suddenly made friends! It's odd, people tend to befriend you more when you have a baby as they see it as something in common. Why don't you try getting to some ante-natal classes or pregnancy yoga or something, even if it is just to meet people? I would say what you're feeling is more likely to be out of loneliness, but perhaps you should mention it to your midwife, just so she knows that you're feeling that way in case it gets worse.  Oh, and my local swimming baths did a class called aqua-natal - a class of aqua-aerobics for pregnant women, that was another good place to meet other pregnant mums.  Honestly, it gets better. We now have a 3 year old and a 4 month old, and I have plenty of my own friends and my own social life. It just takes the confidence to say hello to people.  If I can help at all, email me.|`|tvF86mRDaa	Definitely mention this to your midwife, but remember that you're body is changing and your hormones are all over the place so its perfectly normal to feel down. It might have something to do with the move but its also likely to be the hormones playing a part too!    Maybe go to some groups or exercise classes designed especially for pregnant women? That way you'll meet people who are also pregnant and who might be feeling the same? Then you wont feel so isolated. Talk to your midwife for advice on that as well. Your husband wont be able to fix it, but its up to you to try to figure out a solution with help from him and your midwife and any friends you have.  Please don't feel alone because I bet there a tons of women out there like you, maybe try some pregnancy forums??    http://www.pregnancyforum.co.uk/forum/    http://www.babyandbump.com/    Good luck and best wishes. x|`|MHNFnBzgaa	hey hunni    I think it's just loneliness... think a lot of pregnant women feel like this.  but Definitely mention this to your midwife.    and remember that your hormones are all over the place so its perfectly normal to feel down while pregnant|`|P25GuvNjaa	I think its probably a bit of depression brought on by loneliness, I think a lot of pregnant women feel like this, i certainly did with both pregnancies but especially the first when all my friends seemed to disappear and my husband seemed to be going out all the time.  You should mention it to your midwife, I hate to think of you feeling so lonely!  Why don't you try the cow and gate website, its www.cowandgate.co.uk, you can go and find other pregnant women in your area on it, it might work out to be good fun!|`|gsiso5Ecaa	Hello hun, firstly welcome to or welcome back to the uk. I can understand what u mean , im 32 weeks pregs today and only just getting over my preg depression,i did`t have it with my first child but have done this time round. Its hormones, unfortunately. my boyfriend is lovely but that did`t stop me taking it all out on him, i would cry ALL the time, and feel silly but felt bit better after.I would say keep busy but even that does`t work all the time BUT also can, just let each day go by, dont watch any thing negative on tv, maybe read-i do now at night(never use too!) sorry cant be any more help... good luck, it will pass. clare xx|`|1CryEnb3aa	I think its both.  Loneliness and depression.  You ar depressed because you have no friends or a job.  Talk to your midwife about it for sure.  She may have some info she can give you.  Try getting out a bit more, go for a walk anything.  Just don't stay cooped up in your house.  This will only make you more depressed.  hang in there it will be ok.  Good luck and congrats on your pregnancy!|`|AA11763588	I know how you feel. I'm in another country because the military moved us. Before we even found out we were expecting a new baby my husband was deployed.     He was supposed to be home in January, not back yet, then he was supposed to be home any day now, nope not happening.    I pretty much had a break down today, told him I wasn't sure if I was depressed or just hungry for an adult conversation! He called a few times today to check on me. I feel better, but I'm still hormonal and emotional.    If you truly feel depressed I would bring it up to your midwife.     Good luck! I hope it all works out for you.|`|jOyzcJd7aa	Hey I'm feeling exactly how you are. I think it's just loneliness...I'm an army wife stationed out in Korea and I don't get a long with any of the wives =/ It's also hard to make friends since we're pregnant and it's not that easy to get out there and do what everyone else is doing. I'm sure we'll be fine though maybe over time us girls will meet someone that we could get along with ya know? Don't stress to much!
LTI3GfPaaa	Just sit down and read age appropriate books. You should have started when he was younger, but either way at least you're doing it. Most of those online things are hoaxes. If you want to get a good reading foundation make a tradition to read to him at the same time every day. (I read to my son before bedtime). Kids like repetition, so usually they will like the same books ALL the time!     When you read, try to fluctuate your voice to the character's in the book. Don't be monotone. You can also get flash cards for him to learn his ABC's. My son loves his flash cards and LOVES to show off, lol.     Good luck!|`|xOr67VDiaa	I always thought at that age it was great to say the words and  get them to say it too, its hard to keep their attention, so you have to make it exciting and make them laugh at some of the words, so you say the word funny and give a funny look, my son loved it and now he is 4 and he knows so many words.|`|rLFmDQezaa	There are a lot of those new leap-frog learning things.    Here's a search I did: http://search.yahoo.com/search?ei=utf-8&...    Hope this helps :)|`|rISHTfK3aa	Just use books that are colourful, have pictures on them and have flaps that he can lift up. Talk about what he can see not the words as he is to young yet to understand the words. If you do this then your son will be able to relate the words to the pictures when he is older.|`|1k6UUC8qaa	just start reading kids love to be read to pretty soon hell do what you do and he'll try to start reading but always read to him|`|I4KqAZThaa	The most effective and safest method will be to use an online program if you want to do it yourself. Online programs are really helpful so they will help your kid to learn reading quickly.|`|AA12380885	To start with...better practice verbally.  Alphabets,numbers  n rhymes.|`|AA12157171	Reading should have began at birth. Reading is something that happens over time and it is best to begin reading to a child as soon as they are born. They might not pick it up for a few years, but by reading books to them daily through out child hood , they will pick it up by instinct.    Just start reading books nightly and pointing the words out as you read them. He will catch on.|`|TzTTRG36aa	Here's a link that might come in handy:|`|p3sj5elaaa	bring your child first on a bookstore, have him to take a look at the books, and on where he is interested in, buy it, read it with him. then buy some flash cards with one words and pictures, start with that one first, if your child doesn't have any experience in reading. when he  shows signs of boredom, it means that he is ready to learn something new, it also means that he already mastered what you taught him last time. make your level higher after that, buy some alphabet posters and tell him the sounds of each letter (phonics) after that, separate the vowels from the consonants, when he is done with that, introduce him on the ch, sh, er... etc. sounds, just patience and practice, it would really take time. good luck! =)|`|sDAnuaBYaa	Alphabet play!!   not just ABC's but A makes the AAHH sound, B makes the BUH sound. letter recognition    starfall.com is really good.

nhgQKvwEaa	Waste of money, you don't need to use any positioners for baby. Place baby on their back to sleep, always.|`|SaRDq9iLaa	The nurses at the hospital told me and my husband not to use one.  They said the positioners are NOT good for the baby, so I didn't use it.  Almost everybody at my shower gave me things off my registry, except my sister-in-law.  She looked at my registry and got me the same idea but a different look or color (example- white hangers were on but she got me pink hanger, a red soft box box was on but she got me a huge hard pick and white one with a picture of her in it!) it was kind of like "I know better than you" but she doesn't even have a baby!!  Sorry for my rant.  Basically you probably will get most things off your registry.  Good luck!!|`|UMRdHuuVaa	I used one - they are NOT a waste of money.  Sleeping a baby on their side is very good for their digestion and prevents the child from getting those horrible flat heads, just change sides each night.  my son is 7 months old and has only just stopped using his - he now sleeps on his side and back all by himself.  I bought mine from target here in australia.|`|SVtZ4vUMaa	My daughter had a flat spot on her head from sleeping on her back all the time. I got a baby positioner for her ( she was about 8 weeks when I got it and is 17 weeks now). Unfortunately she moves A LOT in her cot and wriggled out of it, or wriggled around the cot in it. I couldn't make it tighter so she rolled onto her back. I had to stop using it for her safety. For my two boys (older then my daughter) I borrowed one off my aunt. They are really good if your baby stays still. I would get one for your baby and see how they go with it.|`|bd22ca32eb55bc06eaa923b22bd0e54aaa	We did use one because he has reflux so we got one with an incline. Be careful about letting him sleep in the breastfeeding pillow. I use mine to prop him up in after he eats and he sometimes slides down in it. I'd be worried about letting him stay in it without someone being right there.

Instead of driving places walk. Start walking and/or jogging daily. Find pictures of someone who is that size you wanna be and tape them on the walls in you room, bathroom, kitchen and maybe even keep one in your purse and any time you have the urge to be lazy or eat junk takes a good hard look at one of those ok pictures.    Also, after you have your correct amount of food before getting more slowly drink a glass of water.    I know easier said then done. But I hope I helped some.|`|TGtgMu8eaa	Anyone can.

u0udwkZQaa	About as likely as you getting him to ejaculate in your hand and then you trying to insert that ejaculate into your vagina. Anything's possible, but it's very unlikely, the key factor is assuming there's a lot of sperm deep in your vagina, if you orgasm. If you orgasm, you don't eject 90% of the ejaculate back out called "flow back". It is difficult to get pregnant from normal sex let alone this kind of transferring.          -4points for what? There's more accurate facts in my post than anyone else's. Oversensitive bunch of nancies.|`|1CryEnb3aa	Some say yes, I say no.  If the sperm hits air it dies.  So, be careful and use protection or you will end up pregnant.|`|buI2TVpvaa	Na waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa|`|r7q8LW7Aaa	Possible? Yes.  Likely? No.|`|AA11763588	If any sperm touches the vagina then there is a possibility.    Edit to Add to Theresa..    Let's take what you said: Sperm dies when it hits the air... have you ever talked to a DR about that?! Well I'm here to tell you that you are WRONG. If Sperm died when it hit the air, then there wouldn't be any SPERM BANKS with men ejaculating into cups... think about it, do some research.|`|pzLDXL6gaa	Yeah it's possible - if he shoves a big gob of semen in the woman she can get pregnant. If there arm sperms inside and she's fertile, it doesn't matter how they get there - penis or finger it has the same result. But I think it's pretty unlikely.     Sperm do not die when they hit the air, they die when their semen dries up. If they died when hitting the air, sperm donation and sperm tests etc. would be impossible. Glad to see somebody else made that point because I'm sick of being the only answerer who knows it.    Harriet|`|c1399de03ef647ddb85fb6f6fd6f6c2baa	Possibility yes, but unlikely. And sperm does not die when it hits airs, don't believe anyone that tells you this! How silly.|`|DRSjrp04aa	Probably.|`|1831ede9e27aa3948ecfe643b6ae8bfbaa	Highly, highly unlikely, but technically possible, yes.|`|hfr9rLjkaa	No where the hell did you go to school?|`|7a51fc18f5c6477f0af393f7851e59bfaa	Possible yes, but will it happen not likely.

They are really good just go in and ask they will let you try them on
e5FoLh2Paa	I'm a L&D RN---your actual milk doesn't come in until several days AFTER you deliver.  Initially after you deliver, your body will produce colostrum for your baby.  This is the antibody rich "stuff" that's so good for your baby.  This is of course all your baby needs--no supplements like formula if you're sold out on breastfeeding.|`|EvXqkrvAaa	No it means nothing, she is wrong.|`|E8wkkN38aa	That isn't true i was 38 weeks pregnant and had a Cesarean, and i hadn't started leaking yet, it took about 4-5 days before my milk come through properly but i was told it does take longer when you've had a cesarean. So i wouldn't worry to much, good luck and take care.|`|1CryEnb3aa	No.  She is crazy.  You may not leak at all, or you may leak like  a sieve.  Remember every pregnancy is different, including yours.  You may not have this with this one and your next you will.  I hope this makes sense.  Good luck and congrats!|`|xOr67VDiaa	a lot of woman squeeze and see it its their, and for 2nd 3rd pregnacys it is more likely to be there, wait till after you have the baby and you will see your boobs blow up like balloons, i was a bit freaked out the 1st time cos they go so hard and heavy and painful, but you just make sure you wear a good bra and everything will be fine, dont stress cos even if it doesnt happen the formula these days are just as good, but im sure it will appear and you will think wow where did it all come from lol|`|Y7sio6Yhaa	this is NOT true, most of the things people tell you are going to be complete bullshit, your milk doesnt come in till the very end, sometimes women give birth and their milk still hasn't come in yet, but that doesnt mean it wont lol tell her she's dumb for me. it's not right of her to scare you like that.|`|iq5uwobOaa	your fine,   just remember every pregnancy is diff.  and your doing the right thing by asking your doctor.      but you should be fine,  I have known people not to having anything until they went into labor.    good luck|`|aTk0A9SHaa	That's not true in my third pregnancy my boobs started leaking from very early on. The milk doesn't come into the boobs until after birth which is when they really swell up and go hard also becoming very sore and you will find it difficult to get comfy
4df9a4b43e6a8126c7fef5402bfd401aaa	I completely understand your fear of dentists, I hate going to the dentist. I had to visit one on my last birthday for a root canal treatment. It's not an ideal way to spend your birthday but I had to. So think of it this way - what's the worst thing that can happen if you don't go, you will end up making the cracked filling worse and will eventually have to go anyway. It's similar to being scared of labour/delivery when pregnant, you really can't do much, the baby has to come out somehow, Your cracked filling needs to be attended to so try and focus your mind on getting this done.    Speak to the dentist before the visit, let them know you are pregnant, they should tell if there are extra measures put in place for patients who are pregnant. e.g wearing a protective gown during x-ray etc. Remember it has to be done and once it's done, you can put the experience behind you.    Good luck and all the best with the pregnancy.    Best of luck|`|6Btmg7Tcaa	Pretty much the only thing that would harm the baby in a dental sense is an x ray and chances are you wont need one of those. Forgive me but I think your using the baby as an excuse there. I used to be scared of the dentist and have been pregnant so I know the excuses as I've used them myself.    All you will feel is very fast short sharp prick in your gum as the dentist puts the anasthetic in, you wont feel anything after that. Take deep breaths, wiggle your toes and keep telling yourself it wont last forever and will soon be over.   Mouthwash will not stop it getting infected sooner or later. Yes pregnancy does make your gums bleed more but if you dont get this filling done you'll eventually end up with a serious infection and you'll probably have to have the tooth out.    If you cant do the dentist how do you plan on giving birth? Going to the dentist for  this will last no more than ten minutes, giving birth may take you days. I know what i'd rather do|`|627pWyVkaa	Dentists know what they can and can not use on you, and its best to go when you are in your second trimester so going in 9 weeks is fine! Just make sure to tell them your pregnant and ask them about what they use and what is safe to ease your mind.|`|1831ede9e27aa3948ecfe643b6ae8bfbaa	You should be happy - pregnant women get FREE dental care - focus on that!|`|15edd2ada305cebc05418bc61330bf6baa	please go and get it sorted, just explain that you are pregnant.  I put off for years going to the dentist and when i was expecting my 1st 13 years ago i plucked up the courage and went and my mouth needed lots of fillings and ever since then i've went every six months and i've had 2 more kids since then.  Everyone hates going but i've also read that having diseased gums can do something to the bloodstream, cant remember the details, but please go and it'll be over and done with in a few minutes.|`|iq5uwobOaa	Just let them know you are pregnant and do what I had to do.  Ask if my husband can be in the room holding my hand for support.  I know it might seem childish to others but I hate the dentist and I use to have the sedation kind, but being pregnant I can't.  Him being in with me helped so much      Congrats we both get to have fun with summer pregnancy's|`|646fe42a895447edfec28e3ca8106fa2aa	Giving birth will hurt a lot more than anything to do with your teeth so get over it and just go!  Seriously I know it's scary but once you're there it's not so bad.   Gum disease can be dangerous when you're pregnant because your mouth is directly related to your heart.  Having a baby means making sacrifices - this is just one of yours. Move the appointment and have it as soon as possible so it's not hanging over you.|`|ancCGTqMaa	There is good news and bad news.  The good news is - your dentist won't be giving you a shot, if that is what you fear you can relax.  The bad news - most (hopefully all) dentists will not work on fillings/crowns or anything that requires them to x-ray or numb your mouth.  The dentist may clean the damaged filling and put in a temporary just to hold you over until after your pregnancy.  Until then just make sure you keep your teeth and gums healthy.  Expect some bleeding when you brush and floss.  Good luck and congrats on your pregnancy!  :o)
u0udwkZQaa	Your doctor can tell you how long you have been pregnant for with some accuracy, as long as it was a few weeks between the two times you had sex. If the doctor can't tell you, get a test. Just get either the BF or ex's sperm and have it tested. Get the guy's condom and use that or tell the ex you want him to give you a sample to check for something. Don't tell the BF. It's not going to do your relationship any good, it's just a burden you need to live with and try to forget. Statistically speaking, women have a much higher tendency to get pregnant from their non usual partner so I do wish you luck. If it's not your BF's, and you don't want an abortion, you may be able to have the embryo collected and developed artificially, or it may be too late at this stage, but it's what you should start asking about.|`|1CryEnb3aa	Hard to say with out actual dates.  But, you need to be completely honest with him.  You can't build a relationship on a lie/secret like this.  Be prepared for the reaction.  Good luck|`|xOr67VDiaa	It doesnt really matter if its his or not, it matters who is going to rasie it, if youre really worried and there is a huge chance its not his, then he has a right to know, but if youre not so sure, then why ruin it for you and him and the baby. i suggest you calculate the days and really see, he has a right to know if its not his or not, but if he wants it so bad then it wouldnt matter, because he is the one youre going to be with, not the other dude so?? i dont agree you should lie about it, cos it will be a lie for the rest of your life and a lie for the childs whole life, you need to really make sure and if its eating you inside then you have to do the right thing, and make sure you tell him you slept with another dude because you were really confused, and you need some sorta attention, because dumping you when he goes into jail isnt a very nice thing to do, its almost like it became your fault from all the pain you would have sufferd, do the right thing and make sure youre right with everything b4 you tell anyone anything.|`|75l2smfCaa	If you didnt cheat then why cant you just tell him that you did the 'deed' with someone else and the baby might not be yours. If you didnt cheat then there should be nothing wrong with it? Get a paternity test and figure out for sure. Good luck, hope it goes the way you want.|`|QhVCn7rsaa	Be honest and hope that he loves you enough to stay.    Once the baby is born have a DNA test and pray it's your boyfriends|`|aTk0A9SHaa	Since you don't know your last period it's going to be hard to find out when you conceived the only way i can see is when you  have your first scan and they tell you how far gone you are maybe you could work it out from then. But its probably best to be honest with your partner if you wasn't together then he cant say anything at the end of the day he chose to go to prison and leave you.|`|P4Jc76GPaa	DLB,  One thing I have learned over the years is that you can't keep a secret. It always comes to light eventually. You need to be honest and tell your boyfriend. If not, it could haunt you for the rest of your life. But you also need to tell this other male. By doing this you could end up losing your boyfriend, but wouldn't you feel worse if 10 years down the road he found out. Good luck. I hope it works out for the best.|`|79eRDIbXaa	So when was your last period and when did you sleep with Your ex? Do you know how far along you are?    EDIT: Either way this is a really hard situation, I mean I would have to be honest with my boyfriend as imagine the hurt of thinking a child was yours and it wasn't. However as honest as you may like to be, it is going to be hard finding out that you gf is pregnant with maybe her ex's baby when you are stuck in a cell. You need to just be honest!|`|627pWyVkaa	You'll have to wait until you have an ultra sound, But if you had sex with these two guys within a two weeks time span they wont be able to accurately tell you which one/guy it was..... Just tell your doctor your unsure when your last period was, and when he does the ultra sound he will say your about ....so many weeks. But as i said if its more then 2 weeks they wont be able to tell.  If you dont want him to know just yet thats your prerogative. However you want to spend the rest of your life with a guy who was thrown into jail?? Shouldnt you maybe be thinking about your baby and yourself safety and well being, and who can provide for you...... Just go to your doctors and best of luck!! and congrats!!   Also you always have adoptions and other options to consider. Make sure you know and have talked with your doctor before you speak too your boyfriend, and possibly cause unnecessary stress.|`|tjNJAn75aa	You have to tell him. Whichever way things work out it will be for a reason. Not telling him is a cowardly thing to do and every thing comes out in the end. Do the right thing and tell him so he can decide what he wants to do.|`|X0xHXDcTaa	This is one of those situations where if you keep your pants on then you don't have all these questions!     There is no way of knowing who the father is, if you had sex with them both around the same time. You would have to have a paternity test done. It can be done when you are further along in your pregnancy or after you deliver. I am sure he is going to be upset, even if you weren't with him at the time. Mainly because this now complicates your relationship and because I am sure he feels you belong to him and shouldn't have been with anyone else. The only thing I can tell you to do is pray and try to get your life straight! If your b/f was in jail, is he really responsible and smart enough to be raising a child? I know not every person who goes to jail is horrible, I don't know his situation. I would just examine him closely before letting him raise my child!|`|ZYEIsoDDaa	the only way yur going to find out honey is if you get a test done when the baby is born.. but you need both the fathers consent obviously to do the test...    explain to him that you guys were over, you were depressed, maybe drunk and feeling like you needed someone to maybe take his place..    remind him that it meant nothing always you would be with your ex right now and not your bf...    if he wants a baby bad then he should except this child as his especially if he loves you...    but dont have his kid right after this baby because he might treat his kid better then your ex's..    but did you say that you had a light period after you had sex with your bf and your ex anyways..?    and you did have sex with your bf 1st so there maybe a chance that it is your bfs.. a better chance infact...      i think that you should tell him that you and your ex had sex while he was in jail.. if he wants to know if its his or not suggest the test... if he doesnt then if you dont want to know and just want the baby to be his then dont bother with the test....    also you and your bf had sex in dec last year, but when did you and the ex have sex, and how far along are you...    i mean if it was atleast a month between the two then the father will be easier to work out, because how far along you are and when you had sex with who will decifer who the father is..      and i dont think it sounds bad... he went to jail not you and many great successful snobe people [even tho they judge it] have one night stands and have sex with their ex's.. its a thing that happens... im just glad that you didnt cheat..      good luck..|`|isSwC8Xfaa	Why would you want to have a baby with someone who has just been released from prison? But you need to be completly honest with him.|`|e5FoLh2Paa	Sounds like an episode from the Maury Povich show.  "I don't know who my baby dady be because I slept around".
26cnysY3aa	i heard lots of people use the "dummy fairy" and my mother who is a nursery nurse says it works brilliantly!    Also i was told there is a farm in the uk where you can take your old dummies and donate them to the baby animals in the farm....  I havent a clue where it is tho...    Good luck!!|`|ed052b6f800dc43932558f491194a7b8aa	with my daughter we started slowly by stopping her having it in the day time  when she woke we put it in the cupboard until bed she couldnt see it and we just kept saying we couldnt find it and tried to take her mind off it  once that was working we did the same at bedtime until finally she stopped asking   good luck they are a god send when we want them but hell when its time to let go!|`|1c1f532d0b7b25b3aae753390d6e60b8aa	I invented the dummy fairy, told my children that if they stopped having their dummy through the day the fairy would watch, then if they went a whole week without having it at night either then the fairy would take their dummy and give them a present instead.|`|Wps4XuqHaa	My daughter turned 3 jan. So at xmas time when she was 2 yrs and 11 mnths "santa" took her dummy away in exchange for lots of presents!! She has never asked for it since! I would leave it till his 3rd bday in april and tell him he's gona get lots of presents if he puts his dummy in the bin!!|`|2oPTgm9baa	You have to make it something that he does for himself rather then you just taking it away, I told my son he had to put it on the xmas tree ready for santa to take away and that worked great we never looked back, you could always try leaving it under their pillow for the dummy fairy to take away and there maybe something in it's place, just stick with it you'll be surprised how easily children adapt to new situations.|`|r7q8LW7Aaa	My daughter gave hers to Santa  - a month after her 3rd birthday. She was addicted to her dummy so I really thought it'd be a big fight. I'd mention the dummy fairy like someone else says. Take him out shopping and let him find something he really really wants and tell him if he gives all his dummies to the dummy fairy, he'll get one of those!  You might find yourself surprised. I was worried that mine might nick her little sister's dummies, but I replaced all of hers with a very slightly different shaped one and said that they were specifically the baby's dummies - she has never touched them.|`|P25GuvNjaa	Discuss how having a dummy is for babies and he is a big boy now, make him think its his decision to get rid of it, collect them all and have a throwing away ceremony and thats it - make sure theyre all gone and never get another one, no matter if he has serious tantrums!  Another thing I heard that I thought was a good idea was to leave them out for the dummy fairy before bed and in the morning have a gift for them, a bit like the tooth fairy!|`|cPlDc7I1aa	i started cutting back on when they were allowed their dummies.  My older son was the worst because they were like a security blanket to him, he'd have one in his mouth and then another one in each hand.      I first started by taking dummy away everytime we went out, so they were only allowed it in the home.  Then i took it away when they had daytime nap and finally took it away when they went to bed at night. I explained to each of them that they were big boys now and didn't really need a dummy anymore as they were only for babies, and to be honest it went quite smoothly.  I would say it would be an easier transition for your son if you were to do it gradually rather than cold turkey, so to speak :o)    Good luck!|`|c7cf72298a7b440a9bcaa961b4b36e6aaa	had same problem with my daughter. when she was two and a half i decided it was time to wean her off it. in the car she used to hand me her dummy and i would pretend there was a baby bird out there who wanted it, so id open the window and whistle and pretend a bird came along and took it off me. then id tell her oh  the birdie took it. she found it funny...then id keep doing it for a few days, after saying i got it back off him each time. then last time i did it, i would " call" him back  with it, and tell her that he went away somewhere else and isnt coming back with. she enjoyed all that....and surprisingly she never even asked for it again after. that was almost a year ago. fully grown out of it now, thank god. next poblem is the bottle she gets before bed, and geting rid of that....gonna be great fun doing that!!
oXzHvsBpaa	Yes I had to see my OB after my son was born. I had an abnormal pap smear. They had me come in and do a Colp. which is where they take a biopsy of the wall.Turns out that I have Cervicitis which can be very common after pregnancy and they gave me medication to use for 5 days and then to come back in the next 3 months for another pap smear.  Did they say what the problem was? Hopefully it won't be anything too big.|`|f50f6a665c054d5ffd525f5a31663073aa	its just a check up|`|N1IQuM1jaa	i had a baby 4 months ago, and had to go for a checkup 8-10 weeks after birth.  also had a small cyst which they saw on my 12 week scan...never been mentioned since!|`|PtoSxH6haa	its just a check up dont worry nothing to stress about|`|qYNCV6L1aa	It's just a check up. I'm surprised they had you wait this long. My OB saw me 6 weeks after giving birth just to make sure I was healing properly. Don't worry :)
yRlIXECTaa	You can only get pregnant when you are ovulating.|`|buI2TVpvaa	Most unlikely but possible|`|6XR6ajTraa	You don't usually ovulate while having your period, ovulation should occour 10 days before your period and the fertile stage only lasts for 24-36 hours. So tell her not to stress. Check out the ovulation charts so for future reference she knows when to abstain from sex.|`|ZYEIsoDDaa	anything can happen at anytime..      but maybe not..    buy her a test..|`|97KCRDotaa	its unlikely cos when u on your period u shed the lining..if u are shedding it then the egg cant implant in it, so even by some miracle she ovulated and fertilized the egg its unlikely it would implant.|`|shKc7lZcaa	I did!
887c98bb93131aaca2506309ffca224baa	Most likely it is the baby 'dropping' into the birth canal and that puts pressure on the bladder and the pelvic bones a bit.  Also 'early' and 'mild' labor can feel this way too. Best advice is a doctor visit or a clinic (after hours) to see if you are dilated, and they can put a monitor on you to measure for contractions to see if it is braxtons hicks contractions (AKA false labor or practice labor) or the real deal, and they can see the baby heart rate to make sure the heart rate is in a normal range... no biggie, just routine so if you are in labor they can see how the baby is handling the 'workout'... good luck!|`|1CryEnb3aa	Sounds like your round ligament muscle.  Or the baby is in an awkward position and pressing on a nerve.  Call your dr to be safe.  Good luck and congrats|`|Ohsqy2xoaa	i have had the same problem.  It is from the baby laying low and when i go to get up and walk it takes a few steps because of the pain|`|0pX1oQAJaa	contractions. or that you should try to stay off of your feet because the baby is too heavy on your body. or youre straining the baby somehow. either way, get off yahoo and go to the doctor! any pain isn't good to have during pregnancy :O!|`|SfdTlJ6Vaa	To me, it sounds like you might be having pre-term labor. I would call your doctor.|`|f50f6a665c054d5ffd525f5a31663073aa	its the baby moving down and gettin ready for birth, ring ur midwife/doctor and ask then coz they may want to c u|`|627pWyVkaa	I would go in to explain it to your doctor (the pain) and see what they say, Its probably because you are so close to your due date, your baby is almost ready to be born, And it could depend how long you are up standing for. Its also likely your straining your muscles and ligaments around your uterus, that supports the baby! Its too much weight for your frame too carry around, try too relax and maybe keep to sitting as much as you can.|`|yvQpQjv1aa	ohhh, i guess it could mean a few things. at37 weeks pregnant possible you are in early stage of labour? :) it aso could be the position bub is in your tummy, could even be wind lol. :)  take it easy and try to relax, incase u are in labour. how exciteing!! ( i know easier said than done)  good luck, and what an exciting time for you. take care:)|`|ag5MBhxLaa	UTI u can get them when ur pregant and it is way more common in pregnant people|`|d8vzlH4saa	If you are having any pain or discomfort I would go see someone and they can rule out anything serious.   Your body is going through some amazing changes, some that unfortunately hurt a bit and I am sure everything is fine, but I would go get it checked to put your mind at ease.  I am 29 weeks pregnant and suffered with Gastritis, its a pain at the top of your bump, its when your stomach cant get rid of acid, one Dr told me it was a pulled muscle! My midwife knew straight away what the problem was, 60 tablets later and 3 weeks on, I feel great now.x.  Good luck, hope your feeling better soon!
FxLaA8d6aa	in IVF ,conception depnds on many things like ur age,ur medical reports so its not so easy to say anything.anyways best of luck.
ZejwYamhaa	In a study performed in Canada it was found that the pregnancy success rate is 35% and the live birth rate is 27%.|`|FxLaA8d6aa	i can't giv u any %age,as IVF success rate depnds on many things like couple's age,there medical conditions,and also there mental status.|`|qEWYC3qvaa	A lot of them are successful... just be careful! IVF ends w/ multiple babies a good bit of the time!
hzlqCBWnaa	5 and down is considered negative,. but this could be a chemical pregnancy. or just wayy to early. when i was 4 days before my period my levels were at 13 and said i might miscarry, i didnt. so who knows, maybe you are pregnant|`|1CryEnb3aa	Have you had a blood test done?  If so, your dr should have told you if you were or not.  Are you on any hormone, or thyroid medications?  Some can give off hcg reading on prg tests.  Good luck|`|XE45S6OTaa	Do another beta test.  If is rises , then you are pregnant, if it decreased or stayed the same after 2 days, you are not.|`|dxlNwGuWaa	It is possible-the aveage woman carries between 0 and 0.5 hcg in their system without being pregnant so you are only just over.  Take a test the day your period is nest due, and you should get your answer.|`|Ohsqy2xoaa	anything under 4 is neg|`|xgDOQB7Aaa	your hcg says negative so i doubt you are pregnant and should see the dr regarding the spotting maybe the sex was too rough?
b2huJkOjaa	I think that there is a really good chance that you are.  Buy a test and if it comes back neg then I would go get some blood work done because i was 3 month and all the test said that I was not but the blood work said that I was indeed expecting.  Good Luck|`|6XR6ajTraa	You could very well be. You have stated a lot of pregnancy symptoms.   White discharge, pains in kidney area (I had them) heartburn, feeling sick, smells making you feel yuck, not able to consume food as normal. I'd say the chances are that you are indeed pregnant. I've also had dreams of being pregnant and found out that I was and it was a shock. Take a test as soon as you can and good luck.|`|ZYEIsoDDaa	i dont think soo      but buy a pregnancy test..    that'll work better then asking us lol.
Wps4XuqHaa	Hehe our avatars are sooo alike!!|`|ZxvKvtcEaa	yes it happens alot to peole,you could be dragging your feet across carpet and it will shock you..but maybe ask your doctor if it continues to hurt you whem you get shocked|`|iq5uwobOaa	The reason for this is the dry air.  My laptop shocks me at times.|`|d8vzlH4saa	Its the soles of your shoes that create static electricity and it builds up through body and when you touch something, Bam! You get a shock. If you're like me I drag my feet which makes it worse! Try some different shoes, it should help you.x.x. Good luck.x.x|`|75l2smfCaa	haha I was complaining about the same thing yesterday!!! I have been getting shocked like crazy too! I really dont know what it is from, but Im in the same boat. Some of the shocks are good ones huh?! I dont know how all that energy gets pent up like that. Maybe its the weather. We got really nice weather out of the blue, so I think it has to do with that???? I dont know tho!! Good luck and hang in there! :) Im deff feeling your pain!|`|b5ySK6SGaa	I have heard about pregnant women being more likely to have static shocks. Look it up apparently its because of increased electrolytes in your body due to the hormonal changes etc.
f4zg7LHLaa	not all teenage fathers do. the media are generalising, as usual.  i know two teenage fathers, and they are amazing fathers, who support their families. one was actually a party boy before he was a father, and i am so pleasantly surprised by how he turned his life around.     it is the same for teenage mums, we get the image of Vicky Pollard type people, dressed head to toe in Burberry, adidas trainers, gold jewelry, massive hoop earrings, with a cigarette hanging out of our mouths, pushing a buggy with a scantily clad infant with chocolate smeared around their mouths.      fact is, you cannot tar everybody with the same brush        oh, and i am a 19year old mum. my son was concieved when i was on the pill. my partner and i have been together for over 3 years, and never would i dream of saying he was a mistake. he happened at a very bad time in my life when all ties had been severred with my family, and the only person i had in the world was my BF. my son saved me, and my relationship with my family. he is a blessing, and i count myself so lucky each and every day|`|r39EDGhPaa	I know a situation where the mother left the child with the father.    I don't think there is a specific reason for why people abandon their children.  And FYI, it's not just teenage fathers who do it.  Teenagers just don't like the idea of commitment and responsibility.  And, babies come with both of those.|`|Iz5tNA5aaa	I think many fathers abandon their responsibilities to the child and mothers because they are scared of the emotional and financial responsibility.  It is much easier to bail when the girl (woman) is the one who is actually carrying the baby, giving birth and, therefore, must take care of it.    As for the parents of the teenage father -- IMO, since they probably don't know that their son is sexually active there is a strong possibility that they wouldn't know if he got someone pregnant.  However, if they find out there is a grandchild out there, they should force their son to take responsibility and to grow up and be a man about it.  If they don't, they are just as guilty of abandoning that child as their son is.|`|uhj76Fkpaa	cause they get frightened about being a father.It seems too MUCH for them to handle.They aren't mature.They try to avoid the responsibility of a child even though they had sex before and took a girl pregnant.|`|LMc23g9Maa	Male or female, teenage is NOT the right time to have a child.  Nobody can't seem to repeat that enough!|`|oRzqWhsDaa	They are grown enough to have sex but not grown up enough to accept responsibility|`|692c8795f68a0ba95a0d09139d70c98caa	My daughters father had his first daughter when he was 17, her mom bailed out when she was 6 months old, he has raised her for 8 years now, ive helped for the last 6.    Its just media, and they always blow it out of proportion.   However it is of course more common for the teenage boy to bail out, a teenage mom has the experience of being pregnant and feeling life inside her, and the pain of childbirth along with all the emotions.. she loves the child before its born.  The father doesnt get this experience, and often their minds are not mature enough to build the bond thats needed from birth.|`|rLDATlNcaa	Maybe they weren't thinking about the responsibilty of what they did has.And when the mother turns out to be pregnant they freak out and leave because they are scared of responsibility.  But the media probably likes making it sound stereotypical too.|`|XUQaRpgxaa	i think that they are not prepared to have a child they want to enjoy themselves while they still can|`|GN8ky1wOaa	I had a child when me and my partner were 16. He has left us and now he has 2 more families! He has a bad drug problem. I think I did his head in! I was no good for him and he abandoned us when he found a chick that put out. Thanks for reminding me!|`|ZYEIsoDDaa	its not just the fathers...    its just a better headline thats all..|`|h84uIkZOaa	teenage abandon their child because they don't want a child, they just want to have sex. as if they care about the mother too. the child would just be an "accident" or "mistake", just like how they call it.  media sugarcoats for the young viewers.
iq5uwobOaa	I would take a test.  I am sure you know that.      I am going to tell you my first early symptoms because I have a feeling that is what you want to hear, just to see if anyone else felt the same way.    I was tired all the time.  I had these blue veins that increased in my breasts  I took a test the day before my missed period and got a BFP.    I wish you luck and hope you are pregnant.|`|LTD0qL6Yaa	It's certainly possible if you had sex in the middle of you cycle. Go and buy a test but make sure you buy the most sensative one you can, it will give you the most accurate results. Good luck, baby dust to you xxxxoooo
7DWy8mPZaa	Your charting information will be the best source to go by. No-one will be able to give you more accurate dating than that itself! I would possibly consider using OPKs as well in the lead up to a a raised temperature which is sustained for 3 days plus (this will indicate you've ovulated). This just gives you a bit of fore-warning of when to BD to catch that egg, especially if you're busy. BD'ing once every other day should be sufficient if hubby has a normal sperm count. Most people conceive through BD'ing on the day of ovulation, day before or day before that.     Just because you have a longer period doesn't necessarily mean your Ovulation day will be set back. Some women even find they ovulate right after coming off their period! Keep awares, especially as you have a pretty usual, 26-28 day cycle. You can estimate by counting back 14 days from the day you expect your next period to arrive but this is a bit of guesswork. The temps will be the most accurate.|`|6XR6ajTraa	Not that I know of. I'd use ovulation tests to pin point the exact time for conception. Good luck, baby dust and hope you get your BFP soon.|`|iq5uwobOaa	no a long period will not delay ovulation.  just go by your ovulation chart.      Good luck hope you get that BFP|`|CL5Plgekaa	Hi. I'm not sure that a longer period should have any effect on trying to become pregnant. You should try when you notice EWCM. Tip is to keep a note of the dates this appears. This is the most fertile time of your cycle. EWCM is released before any   bleeding.
V8St1NEDaa	It sounds to me like you are approaching labour, slowly but surely. you should see your midwife or even your gp just in case its an infection cos that would also cause back ache.|`|Ohsqy2xoaa	i have been having brax hicks since 28 wks and sometimes for hours at a time close together.  sadly they dont mean a whole lot|`|721055bb4f4a90cbc769262d4684a39daa	id wait and see if your braxton hicks start to last longer in that case they can be actual contractions the holy sure fire way I think would be your water breaking that's a dead give away! Good luck|`|99af71d6c2927cce636eb721484f7c4caa	Call your midwife hun. That's what she's there for. If you can't get her try delivery suite or NHS Direct. It's best to check and they are all there to advise you.     To be honest though, from here on in it does get pretty uncomfortable, labour or no labour! Well worth it though ;D    Good luck!    Sarah  ~X~
xue72D76aa	You'll feel full blown kicks soon.  He is still pretty small in the grand scheme of things and still has a lot of room to wiggle and move.  As he grows, he'll become more cramped and you'll definitely feel those arms and legs.  As you get nearer to delivering, you won't feel those huge kicks and punches anymore because he'll be getting too cramped to do such big movements anymore.|`|5deb28fe9fecaef7f55e1f593df11203aa	you will feel him kicking soon, pretty soon your baby will not have enough room to move and then you will feel more pokes and kicks than swooshing|`|pUwJcZwvaa	I'm now 33 weeks pregnant and i didnt feel any real movements until about 6 months gone.  Anything i felt before that felt like wind, it was only after this that i could actually tell that it was the baby which was moving.  it sounds like u r feeling what i felt and it is ur baby, just not definate movements - u will know when they start...kicking and punching...do u feel the movements more when u r relaxing or trying to get to sleep - i was like that for ages, now i feel him all the time...|`|f50f6a665c054d5ffd525f5a31663073aa	wait a couple of weeks and u will
ZejwYamhaa	Well with my first child I dreamt I was having a boy wih brown hair and brown eyes and well i had a girl with blonde hair and blue eyes. Hahahaha dreams help our memory store long term memories. Since you've been thinking about having a girl so much your mind interprets it someway into your dreams.|`|YrK7S8xtaa	when i was 7 months pregnant with my first child, on the 29th of june i had a dream that my baby was born and i said too the doctors "but the baby is 11 weeks early"( i was due sept 16). and the doctors kept telling me (still in my dream) that the baby was only 2 months early.   When i woke up the next day the dates felt so significant to me, not how the baby looked or the sex, just the dates.    From then on i was sure i was going to have the baby on 29th August and i told my whole family and my friends that this would be the date. *(They all thought i was a crazy nutcase for being so certain and only my grandmother would believe me)    Guess what date i had the baby.......................... August 29th.    So in my mind if you feel the dreams are significant then they probably are.|`|VOGpB4rBaa	It may be a sign that you are going to have a little girl. If you believe in god, then god usually gives people dreams to warn them or like a vision. I hope I helped. Good luck!|`|P25GuvNjaa	I had a dream I had a baby boy with blonde hair and blue eyes and my baby was a boy with blonde hair and blue eyes, this time I had a dream I had a little girl with blonde hair and blue eyes, I dont have her yet but I know she is a girl!  Its very strange...|`|3IXDx9nhaa	You are probably wishing what you want in your sub conscious and it is coming out in your dreams.  Try going to bed and thinking of boys names and what you would want your baby boy to be and how nice it would be and see how your dreams might change.|`|p5eodXcSaa	My brother used to have dreams that he had two girls with black hair that looked just like his wife before having kids. But, guess what...He has had three boys in total. No girls what so ever. Emotions play harder than reality.|`|q3Fbkztbaa	i think it probably just because you keep thinking about having a girl|`|TZVH8YNHaa	i think u  always think of girl baby to be born so u dream about the girl baby at night  that's the thing ok please answer my question if u know|`|6aURv616aa	from where i come from a baby girl in your dream means something nice will happen to you.something that u wish for and will come true.
wENdWT5kaa	Well, the only problem you may have is that you are single. But then, there is still a chance.     And as for black babies being well behaved and cute. Babies of ANY race are well behaved and cute. First, babies do NOT misbehave and when they are older, it's all in how they are raised, not because of their race.|`|O9HLoDj9aa	You can adopt any baby that needs adopting. So, yes, you can!|`|Tjr9aObNaa	It shouldn't matter what race the child is! Although there are alot of black and bi-racial children waiting to be adopted. A baby may be more difficult to get than a child. But what are your reasons for wanting to adopt? Just becuase your going to be a good mum? How about that you want to give the chance of stability and love to a child who has missed out on it. Also don't write off adopting a child.  Single or not, you sound eligable...just not ready.|`|2wyDALHgaa	I'm not even going to go into the race issue directly on this one but to say you want a baby, any type of baby, because they are "well behaved and cute" just confirms for me in my mind that you are not ready for adoption and most likely never will be unless you have a 180 degree attitude shift.      I won't even tell you to adopt a dog instead because I've got too much respect for animals.|`|zLoyo24Taa	Perhaps you should wait until your married. Never adopt a child because you think they are cute and well behaved.|`|djlA8Wpdaa	babies are babies,and any up for adoption need good homes no matter what colour.|`|8EsicBxUaa	I think the main issue is you are single..  How will you support the baby if no-one in your household is working?    I wouldn't think that all babies are well behaved and cute, this will not be a good decision if that is the reason you want one  You have to have more reason than they are cute..     You could always phone up your local adoption agency and ask for an appointment, but i am sure the fact that you are single will kind of put them off.|`|1NDHSSqwaa	You think that black babies are 'well behaved and cute' - you sound more as if you want an accessory than a child.  Not all black children are well behaved (i am speaking from experience) children of any ethnic background misbehave.    Also, do you know anything about the additional care that black children require? Their hair is vastly different to that of caucasian children and requires special care and they are also prone to skin conditions.    In all seriousness it is very rare for a child to be adopted by people of an ethnic background different to that of the child. The only time i have ever known a black child to be adopted by a white family is when the child had special needs and no-one of a similar ethnic background was willing to adopt said child.|`|iVcaB9h7aa	You may want to think about rewording your question.  Referring to black children as "well behaved and cute" is a form of racism even if you don't realize it.  I am the mother of a bi-racial child and while she is beautiful, she's isn't and never was particularly well-behaved.  She's been feisty since the day I met her.    That being said, adopting as a single parent is possible, but there's quite a bit of learning you need to do before considering a transracial adoption.  Remember, this is someones life you're thinking about altering and you need to be as well-informed as possible before staring on the adoption journey.    Here's a place to start:  http://racerelations.about.com/od/parent...|`|NoUkTQCgaa	"It" won't be so well behaved and cute once "it" figures out "it's" adoptive parent is racist.|`|yEzCKWzEaa	I think it would better if you adopted a polish white.|`|BTuFtui3aa	People's behaviour is based on personality and upbringing, not race. Black children are not inherently better (or worse) behaved than white children-- race has nothing to do with that. People are just people, regardless of the colour of their skin, and they make their own choices about how to act.    Look, I know what you're saying doesn't sound racist to you, because you're a white person saying something positive about black children. But the thing is, it's racist just to categorize people by the colour of their skin like that. It's racist to suggest that all black people act or think a certain way... even if you see that way in a good light. You're still saying people of a certain race are all the same, and not seeing them as individuals. You're not speaking about them as humans, but as though they were objects. That's really not acceptable.    I don't think you're prepared to parent. Particularly not a child of another race, but even if you mothered a white child, you'd be passing on this harmful attitude of stereotyping. White children may not be targets of racism, but they have to learn to live in a diverse world... and I don't think you're ready to prepare them for that.    I think you need to diversify your own world, before you consider parenting. Actually interact with people of different races and cultures-- not just for the sheer sake of having a diverse group of friends, and not to objectify them, but to see that people are just people. That we all have our positive and negative moments, no matter our skin colour. Because honestly, to me it sounds like you live in a very white world, and you need to understand that there's a bigger world out there.    No matter how positive you are about black children, you're still speaking of them and seeing them as objects. You need to learn that humans are humans, regardless of skin colour. Until you learn that lesson, please don't adopt.|`|bbf1ccedee90968c8671f9573ff1c7c0aa	It's thanks to people like you that insist on reminding me on how selfish and cruel people can be.    Do you even realise an adopted child breathes? Thinks? Feels?    Do you think that when it comes to selecting a baby there will a line of them sitting on a counter top?    "Ginger haired English boy - technologically inclined - free sun cream!"    "New in!! Exotic Singaporean twins  - buy one, get the other for half price!"    "So cute! Black boy, known for their beautiful natures - ready now!!"    Do you have any idea what it takes to be a parent, let alone an adoptive parent of a child who has lost the most important person in his life and how to cope with this?    I agree with Randy, I don't even think you should adopt an animal. Stick with playing with your plastic barbies. You are not only being racist to black people but also white people, assuming that white children are naughty and ugly!!|`|tRXTkzHzaa	Well behaved and cute????  Get a pet not a child.  That was the one of the worst reasons I have heard about why a person is picking a certain ethinic child.|`|pC0GVZCcaa	With that attitude, definately not.    What you are doing is discriminating.    As for adoption, it is a long process and they have to take into account:  * Job - can you financially take care of a child  * Relationship Status - It is preferred that you have a partner  * Health Background    You really have to be a great healthy person to even be considered.  By all meand enquire, but I would suggest changing your frame of mind first my dear.|`|DmJFln79aa	Wow.    It always amazes me when somebody wants a specific gender, or race.  But, your reasoning is racist and you don't even realize it.  I hope for that reason alone, that you are not able to.  You have no business adopting a certain race, until you are ready to adopt any race, imo.    You get a certain breed of puppy for behavioral traits, not a human being.|`|INzs3XJkaa	your racist u only want black baby there not toys all babys are cute if your lookin to give baby a new home you should take any nationality|`|511e806a702f7f4b678843ad2696165faa	"Well behaved and cute"...  How unbelievable.  Any baby can be well behaved and cute.  No matter what the skin color might be.      There are children of all colors and ages out there who need homes.  Its a tad bit racist to only want one race of child.    "Serious answers only please, thanks."  Ask a serious question and perhaps you'll get better answers.  You are way too immature to adopt a child right now.  I'd say wait a few years and try to research adoption and find out the good, the bad, and the ugly.|`|QJcZ4xnPaa	I don't think this is a serious question but incase it is, here is my answer;  I don't think you can adopt a black baby if you are white actually ..I'm not 100% sure though.  Even if you are legally allowed, I think it is best that black children are placed with black families where possible.  This is particularly true if you live in a predominantly white area. There will be many many fundamental issues that the child will have to deal with whilst growing up and you will have NO IDEA what they are going through.  The child will not be able to relate to you about this and this may lead to isolation; on top of the emotions associated with being adopted?  It could all work out fine but  there are alot of risks that it would not be a good situation for the 'cute, well-behaved black kid'|`|E7MgO2pZaa	Would you conceive a child on your own to raise by yourself without a father in it's life if you were able to conceive? I am guessing you would not.    For one thing I think you are way too young to have children, adopted or not. For another thing, I believe you are may be slightly less mature than needed to raise children at this time. Raising adopted children (especially transracially adopted kids) is a very serious undertaking as most of us have baggage, emotional issues, and need a parent who is willing, educated, and dedicated enough to handle those issues. A 21 year old is most certainly not at a place in her life where she is able to provide emotionally for a child.     I am not calling you out and saying you are immature for no reason at all. But you did say in your own words that you want a black baby because "they are well behaved and cute". If you would like a companion that is well behaved and cute I would suggest a cat, a dog, or perhaps a turtle.|`|NlgC3bAmaa	I think you're a little mis-informed about children.  Yikes.  Babysit some first before you decide to adopt one.|`|1hLxd5DWaa	that is a ridiculous racist remark! you cannot label one race of child better than another how dare you! Why don't you get a husband first instead of letting the tax payer pay for your baby huh? I cannot believe someone wants one race of child because they are better than another, totally appalling.|`|XTgTs7Xuaa	Lucy da cat thinks not. The store is currently out of well behaved babies...Would you like to place a back order for a rain check?|`|ZbJ0bx3Uaa	Color shouldn't matter if you want a baby. The color also won't decide the temperament of the baby. I don't think they will let you adopt if you have those expectations. When you want a baby you won't care if they are purple just so long as they are healthy. Good luck I hope you get the baby of your dreams someday, despite race.
848f75b2d80efbaf2e5e5b809911996faa	Each and everytime you do these things you have to also be prepared for parenthood. That's exactly why so many people wait until they're older and in a commited relationship. Also when you do decide to commit, make sure it's not with a girl who's had these close calls and or terminated pregnancies with a bunch of guys as she was growing up. Believe me, you don't want a girl like this as a life partner.|`|hOhugNd5aa	even if she is its probly not urs based on wat u sed. an if she is get a dna test if she trys 2 say ur the father|`|0pLva8nLaa	you. deff. are being paroanoid. trust my *****.|`|AA11606210	Another kid on yahoo answers who's scared of the consequences of their actions. Why is everyone so intent on having sex when they are unprepared? There is so much more to do with your life. Anyhow, I didn't get on here to lecture.   It is ALWAYS possible that she could be pregnant. She may even have gotten pregnant last month and had a period before her body recognized the baby. Worrying about it will make her period late also. My advice, get a home pregnancy test and then sit back and think about how scared this made you both before you choose to have sex again. I am married with two children and with both of them, I expected to get pregnant, and had a period. The next month I showed a positive pregnancy test, and by then I was eight weeks pregnant, so yes, you can have a first period and still be pregnant.|`|N6vEZVNEaa	IF YOU NEVER FINISHED AND IF SHE IS PREGNANT THEN IT IS POSSIBLY IT MAY NOT OR MAY BE YOURS
rvTw8IdDaa	Cousin 1 said these:  ANYA  - I love the name Anya, many reson's behind it. A childhood movie, and its my great aunts name.  APRIL  - I think April is a name for older people, it makes the child sound older and she will probably get called "Ape"  MAY - May is a pretty name, not one of the best on the list, but its not a bad named. and if its a bright baby, like springtime, it would be perfect.  JUNE  The names June and   PEARL   Pearl aren't somthing I would name a kid. June, is pushing the limits to how many kids can be named after months and Pearl just doesn't roll off the tounge well.  LILA - This name is REALLY cute, and incredibly unique, it's not often you hear it and it has a fresh sound.    cousin 2 :  ANASTASIA - Going back to the child hood movie, this name I also love, it just sounds so pretty and regil. HOWEVER;; It will be hard to pronounce and cause her alot of problems. And its just uncommon and hard to spell.  ANITA - Anita, also sounds like an older women to me. Or really, the Aunt "Anita" that you're afraid of.  MIRA  - This name goes up with Lila to me. Its gorgeous unique and just sounds great.  DREAM  -   HOPE -  FAITH -  Dream? Maybe not. It just doesn't sound right to me, Hope is the name you give a kid who almost died, but managed to live [sorry] Faith is also the type of name for a child who brings a family together.  AUGUST - .  HAZEL - I love the name Hazel, its incredibly cute;; and will work even better if the girls eyes, are infact hazel =]        I hope I was of some help;; haha, I just did my best to be honest =]|`|lFaYviUwaa	Anya- nice, but prefer Enya  April- So cute for a middle name if born in April, not so keen as a first name.

bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	I've heard these can be causes.    1. lack of air flow in cribs/babies bedroom  2. over-dressing,leads to over-heating  3. blankets,stuffed animals in their crib while too young  4. sleeping on their sides or stomach when they don't have body strength and coordination to move on their own.    Prevention.    1. Either don't use crib bumpers or use one that is breathable  2. Don't overdress  3. No blankets or stuffed animals in crib  4. Baby positioner to keep them in place on their backs.|`|9IFF0vIoaa	Of course there is the 'back to sleep' campaign.  After looking at data, professionals decided that more babies died of SIDS that were laying on their bellies.  Smoking has been thought to be a big cause...even when parents don't smoke in the house.  The toxins stick to their clothes & hair...and pass to the baby who ends up not being able to oxygenate it's blood properly.    There may also be a correlation to brain size.  But brain size is looked at only during the autopsy.|`|1SGl03Zlaa	Researchers believe that SIDS (in most cases) is caused by babies lack of airflow causing babies to breath recirculated air.  The best ways to prevent this is to make sure their is nothing that could restrict airflow (such as non-breathable bumper pads in the crib and thick blankets).I have also heard that it can be helpful to have a fan on in babies room.  It is also recommended  that babies sleep on their backs so their chances of breathing recirculated air is decreased.    I read an article online today that they are also recommending now not to allow babies to sleep in a sitting position such as in a car seat,  Here's the article http://www.cbc.ca/canada/montreal/story/...|`|nVkypeGBaa	I saw on a report recently that some babies have little or no response at all when the airways are blocked, so if a comforter or bumper or something gets pressed against their face and they stop breathing they haven't developed the response mechanism in their brain that causes them to move to get air. That's one of the reasons why it's so important to make sure baby is wrapped tightly sleeping on their back with no heavy blankets, soft toys, pillows, bumpers etc. for the first 6-12 months. Hope this is helpful!|`|IFDfpbFJaa	That crib bumpers up the chances and co sleeping ups it also. I got an Email from the "back to sleep" campaign saying the one about co sleeping but I read about the bumpers on here.
deIzFnV8aa	Our DD liked rattles or other things that made noise and she could follow with her eyes. Bright colors are also a plus at this age.  In addition to rattles, we used cloth books with simple images and different textures that baby could touch (with help at 2 months) and have fun playing with (ie, trying to eat) when older.    In about a month, your daughter will start batting at things, so bright toys that can dangle and make noise when batted at are good for that age.  Many babies also like things that are fun for sucking on, though they can't start bringing them to their mouths until 3-4 months.    In addition to rattles, we often sat stuffed animals or soft blanket-rattles next to our DD, esp. for story time.  Just realize that stuffed animals can seem big and intimidating to babies, so don't push it if she gets upset.    Your top priority for any toy is safety.  Stuffed animals are supposed to be free of button-eyes that could fall on or ribbons that could strangle.  Toys that are small enough (or have parts that are small enough) to fit through a toilet paper tube are choking hazards.  Stick to these standards now, even though she is unlikely to get able to get the toys to her mouth yet.    And as someone else mentioned, toys are often marked with age range that they are most appropriate for|`|IkkYOehSaa	none. She probably wont be in the slightest way interested. Your face and voice right now will the  most fascinating thing to her. And besides she can't really see that far. Maybe 12-14 inches away and studies have shown that she can't see much color at this point. So the best thing for her is just you. She will study your face like it is the most wonderful thin the world to her, and it is. Make faces at her. and change your voice tone around. She will ove it.Watch her face as you do.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	At two months most babies don't really "get" toys.  She might enjoy a crib mobile, but all she's gonna do is just lie there and watch it.|`|ec20340954300949b5d60c056689dd33aa	usually when you buy them...they will say what age group they are for 3-6 mths for example...  rattles and such are the only things that a 2 mth old would be able to play with....and really they are more interested in the hands and stuff anyway!! lol|`|74pfB2Bnaa	So far your daughter won't really miss toys to play with them on her own. But you can use a doll or a stuffed animal to play with her:  My daughter has a little teddy bear she got at birth. During her first few months, the bear resided on the changing table and when I changed  her diaper and gave her some tummy time, both of which she used to hate at first, I took the bear and let it dance and sing for her. She started tracing the bear with her eyes within the first month. The bear concerts made the changing table more fun for her.
kprKXEOSaa	That is what is supposed to happen, that is why you claim them as a dependent.  The purpose of having taxes taken out all throughout the year isn't so you can get a big refund after April 15, the point is that Uncle Sam wants his cut of your paycheck as soon as possible.  If you're getting a big tax refund each year after you file your taxes, you're having too much withheld and should make changes to your W-4.  It's your money, if you're getting a big refund each year, you have basically given the government your money to use, interest-free, for a few months.  The same is true if you have to pay a lot each year, along with penalties for underpaying.  You want to work it out so you don't have to pay very much if you have to pay, and don't get too much back if you over pay.  A tax refund isn't a free gift from the government, it is the government giving you back what you overpayed.|`|OxFV92hJaa	Yea, that's normal. We have 3 kids, and claim 4 dependants right now. We haven't added our youngest yet. Right now we are claiming my husband, myself, and 2 of our kids. We where expecting around 7k back for tax returns, but only got 5400. He made 6k more last yer than the year before, and claiming 4 dependants took away as well. So the only reason NOT to claim your dependants is if you want a big tax return.     You get more money back claiming all dependants during the year though.     So we will probably add our youngest (2 months old) on, to make his check a lil bigger. I'm an at home mom, so every lil bit helps. It just sucks all the $ for tax returns goes to medical bills! lol, and I'm scheduled for surgery on the 20th to have my gallbladder out! Another $1500ish out the window!     We'll be lucky to be able to take the kids to the zoo, and aquarium after paying all the darn medical bills we owe. Ahhhhh, the joys lol.|`|rAB3iwSvaa	That always happens when you claim. You can still claim 0 even if you have chidren.  Because at the end of the year when you file your W2, they get you back.
CdodhnP5aa	No their price is for watching your child, you have to bring the necessities.|`|b0c36350d835d81614a99e05c0418bf5aa	no, these are things you are providing for your child; you can't even deduct the days when your child doesn't attend. In most cases anyway.|`|JP2h62qiaa	No. That is YOUR kid. YOU buy diapers for it. Not a day care. Lol. And they are required by state law to provide snacks and meals, so that wont work either way.    HAHA do you think you get a discount for providing for your child.|`|aePPpS48aa	ull have to talk to the daycare people to c wat they think bout that|`|u4liwDhAaa	You would have to check with your tax preparer but...  Your child would still need diapers whether or not he/she was at day care or at home.  Same with food.  Your child would still need food whether at home or at day care.  I don't think you can deduct those two items.  Check with your tax preparer.|`|1SGl03Zlaa	No, but you should be able to claim the costs of daycare on your taxes.
Jswomud7aa	My son wasn't ready to eat solid foods until he was 8 months old, whereas my daughter was showing a lot of interest at 4 months and was ready at that time.     Each child is different, if he's not interested he's not ready. The way I jugged their "readiness" was their interest in what mommy and daddy where eating. My daughter would reach for our food and watch us intently early on, while my son was just really content with his bottle for a long time.    The main source of nourishment the first 12 months should be milk. Feeding them solids is more like practice than anything else anyways.    The first few times their tongue thrust reflex (keeps them from choking) will push the cereal out of their mouth and more will end up on the bib then in their tummies! But it's ok, it's a learning process, just let him make his own pace, he may not be ready at all yet.|`|1ezYfkX7aa	Try mixing some stage 1 bananas in with the rice cereal. My first baby would ONLY take it that way =)|`|ZZzQLjaKaa	Does he have the tongue thrust reflex yet? If not, it is too early. Be patient, it is a new texture and takes a while. If he is truly disinterested, then I would wait another 2 weeks.|`|FRwxXGynaa	I tried cereal a few times when my daughter turned 5 months old and she didn't like it much either. I think she was confused by the spoon. I let her play with it for a little bit (the soft rubber spoons) She chewed on it awhile and then the feedings went a little better. Since then I tried giving her some bananas and applesauce and she loves it! She really like the squash and sweet potatoes too. I tried the cereal later and she loved it too. I've been reading that cereal isn't really needed (full of starch) so I've stopped giving it to her every night and just give it every so often for variety.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	What do you need the baby to send you registered mail telling you that he's not ready?    Many babies are not developmentally ready for solids until 9 months.  Babies with allergies may refuse solids until 1 year or older.    http://askdrsears.com/faq/bf4.asp  I also have found that some infants are not developmentally ready for solids until 8 or 9 months.    [...]    I encourage parents not to try to coax their 6 month old into accepting solids before he shows many of the signs of being ready. This can create a picky eater and negative feelings about eating.     http://www.kellymom.com/nutrition/solids...  Although the maturity of babys digestive system is not something that we can readily observe, research indicates that 6 months appears to be ideal for avoiding the allergies and other health risks of too-early solids. After this point, different babies are ready for solids at different times -- developmental readiness for solids cannot be determined using a calendar. Most babies are developmentally ready for solids somewhere between 6 and 8 months.    http://www.llli.org/FAQ/solids.html  Babies who are ready for solids can usually feed themselves. Mothers often report that they knew their babies were ready when they picked up food from a plate, chewed it, swallowed it, and wanted more.    Listen to your baby! Babies with a tendency to allergies may refuse solids until later in their first year. As long as they are growing well and are happy and healthy, there is no need for concern.    http://www.borstvoeding.com/voedselintro...  It appears that a baby's general development keeps pace with the development of his ability to manage food in his mouth, and to digest it. A baby who is struggling to get food into his mouth is probably not quite ready to eat it.    Pureed baby food is 'unnatural'  http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/676279...  She said children should be fed only with breast or formula milk for six months, then weaned onto solids to improve control over how much they ate.    This could prevent babies becoming picky about food.    [...]    Solids best    After six months, Mrs Rapley said babies were capable of taking food into their mouths and chewing it.    Therefore, feeding them pureed food at this time could delay the development of chewing skills.    Instead, she said, they should be given milk and solid pieces of food which they could chew.    Mrs Rapley argued that babies fed pureed food had little control over how much food they ate, thus rendering them vulnerable to constipation, and running a risk that they would react by becoming fussy eaters later in life.    She blamed the food industry for convincing parents that they should give children pureed food.    She said: "Sound scientific research and government advice now agree that there is no longer any window of a baby's development in which they need something more than milk and less than solids."      Why not cereal?    http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9646449/page...  Take rice cereal, for example. Under conventional American wisdom, it's the best first food. But Butte says iron-rich meat  often one of the last foods American parents introduce  would be a better choice.    Dr. David Ludwig of Children's Hospital Boston, a specialist in pediatric nutrition, says some studies suggest rice and other highly processed grain cereals actually could be among the worst foods for infants.    "These foods are in a certain sense no different from adding sugar to formula. They digest very rapidly in the body into sugar, raising blood sugar and insulin levels" and could contribute to later health problems, including obesity, he says.    The lack of variety in the American approach also could be a problem. Exposing infants to more foods may help them adapt to different foods later, which Ludwig says may be key to getting older children to eat healthier.    http://www.kellymom.com/nutrition/solids...  Cereal is not at all necessary, particularly the baby cereals. Regular (whole grain) oatmeal is more nutritious for your baby.    http://www.askdrsears.com/faq/ci2.asp  The truth is, there is nothing special about these foods that makes them better to start out with. Babies don't actually even need rice cereal    http://www.llli.org/llleaderweb/LV/LVDec...  Meat provides additional protein, zinc, B-vitamins, and other nutrients which may be in short supply when the decrease in breast milk occurs. A recent study from Sweden suggests that when infants are given substantial amounts of cereal, it may lead to low concentrations of zinc and reduced calcium absorption (Persson 1998). Dr. Nancy Krebs has shared preliminary results from a large infant growth study suggesting that breastfed infants who received pureed or strained meat as a primary weaning food beginning at four to five months, grow at a slightly faster rate. Dr. Krebs' premise is that inadequate protein or zinc from complementary foods may limit the growth of some breastfed infants during the weaning period. Both protein and zinc levels were consistently higher in the diets of the infants who |`|5ZvALiclaa	well you should always feed him his milk feed first before giving him solids at this age. He is not old enough yet to replace milk with solids.     If he is not interested then don't push it. I tried my son at just over 4 months and he had no interest at all. 2 weeks later i tried again and he lapped it up and hasn't stopped since.     sometimes they just aren't ready and it is no use pushing the issue. Wait another week or two and try again. You could always mix mashed banana or pureed apple or pear into the rice cererl.   My sons favourites are 'Farex - pear and banana rice cereal' and 'Raferty's garden organic rice cereal with banana'. He really didn't like the plain ones at all.    good luck|`|9xiWHYpHaa	He is only 5 months old!  Be patient!!!
