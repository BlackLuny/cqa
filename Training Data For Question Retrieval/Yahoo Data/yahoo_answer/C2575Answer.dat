AA12005596	Bandido aos 16 anos<br>  <br>  A vida de crime de Leonardo Pareja come?ou na adolescência. Ganhou notoriedade aos 21 anos, depois de driblar policiais de três estados durante uma fuga em 1995<br>  <br>  Leonardo Rodrigues Pareja foi um menino delinqüente, um jovem bandido. Nunca matou. Mas fez de tudo no mundo da criminalidade, onde entrou oficialmente aos 16 anos, quando foi preso pela primeira vez, acusado de assalto a m?o armada. Roubava motos possantes anunciadas em classificados. <br>  <br>    Dali para a frente, seguiu o roteiro habitual da bandidagem — entradas e saídas na cadeia, torturas, corrup??o policial, roubos cada vez mais ousados, vida errante. Apareceu no noticiário nacional em outubro de 1995 quando, em Feira de Santana (BA), depois de um assalto, manteve como refém por 61 horas uma jovem de 16 anos. Conseguiu escapar do cerco policial e por 45 dias driblou polícias de três estados — Bahia, Minas e Goiás, onde se entregou na presen?a de um juiz e da imprensa. Já tinha aprendido o valor do ‘‘marketing’’. <br>  <br>    O seu era o do bandido articulado, justiceiro, protetor dos amigos, bonit?o, cheio de namoradas, com discurso atrevido com muitas críticas ao sistema. ‘‘Fui os olhos da sociedade cega’’, disse ao voltar para a pris?o depois de uma rebeli?o do Centro Penitenciário e Agrícola de Goiás (Cepaigo). <br>  <br>    Foram feitos reféns o ent?o secretário de Seguran?a, Ant?nio Louren?o, e alguns desembargadores do Tribunal de Justi?a (TJ), que vistoriavam o local. Na rebeli?o, que come?ou no dia 28 de mar?o de 1996 e durou sete dias, Pareja atuou como líder e porta-voz dos presos amotinados. <br>  <br>    Filho de classe média quase rica, Pareja morou no aristocrático bairro Marista de Goiania, estudou até a 4asérie no tradicional Colégio Ateneu Dom Bosco, freqüentou cursos de piano, inglês, computa??o e jud?. <br>    <br>   Pareja gostava de dar entrevistas e de mostrar dezenas de cartas de garotas que o idolatravam. Eram, em média, 100 por mês. Respondia a 17 processos e cumpria pena de 9 anos e seis meses por assalto a m?o armada — numa única madrugada roubou 11 postos de combustível. Estava jurado de morte por policiais e presidiários rivais. <br>   <br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  A morte aos 22 <br>  <br>    A morte de Leonardo Pareja era anunciada, esperada, prevista. Todo mundo sabia que ia acontecer. E aconteceu: morreu numa segunda-feira, 9 de dezembro de 1996, às 7h30, no Cepaigo. Pareja foi executado com sete tiros à queima-roupa. Dois outros presos ligados a ele também foram mortos. Cinco detentos confessaram os crimes e a polícia diz que o que houve foi uma briga interna pelo poder no presídio. <br>  <br>    Na época, os advogados de Pareja diziam que ele foi morto a mando da dire??o do Cepaigo, depois do vexame provocado pela rebeli?o no presídio. O poder de Pareja passou a ser problema para a polícia dentro da penitenciária quando ele come?ou a usar prestígio de comandante dos detentos para acumular dinheiro. <br>  <br>    O destino colaborou para o marketing de Pareja até no dia do seu sepultamento. O corpo do bandido foi enterrado na ter?a-feira 10 de dezembro, Dia Internacional dos Direitos Humanos. A coincidência fez com que o representante do movimento Tortura Nunca Mais de Goiania, Valdomiro Batista, a colocar no caix?o uma bandeira do Brasil. A iniciativa provocou uma forte rea??o do comandante da PM, Nilton Neri Castilho. ‘‘Isso é um desrespeito’’, disse depois de mandar tirar a bandeira.|`|f8f6acd2bbf2ad4758c9fa643a8aebfcaa	era um bandidinho de bosta. achando que era gente grande.|`|ca328bf92aee4e01f30166e80253ff73aa	Conhe?o.

Com isso, impressionava filhas de gente boa, pois é oriundo de família de classe média que quebrou. Morreu morto dentro da cadeia em Goiania e sua vida foi um fracasso só. Pena, o cara tinha tudo para se dar bem mas a vida quis assim e ele n?o se esfor?ou também para sair dessa ilus?o de roubar para manter o padr?o de vida anterior.

Así, uno de los hechos que caracterizan a los apellidos patronímicos es la diversidad de linajes que existen y, en consecuencia, la abundancia de personas que en la actualidad se llaman así, ultrapasando, muchas veces, el ámbito de una lengua o una cultura.  En este caso, el apellido Gómez es patronímico del nombre propio "Gome", muy usado por los godos. <br>  Este apellido es de origen asturiano y, por cierto, muy antiguo.

AA11609007	if the old timing belt broke with the engine running then you may have a mess on your hands. newer engines have the valves close to the piston and if the piston got into the valves then theyre probably bent and it will be a costly repair. try turning the engine over by hand in the oposite direction that it turns while running, if it turns that direction but not the other then you most likely have a valve bent and wont let a piston go all the way to the top...but then again i dont know much about kia motors, just a thought|`|2d604a0513c3e9ace8f80563ffec59dcaa	If timed incorrectly valves will be open at TDC, result: no compression.

If you know that something is wrong with it you can find parts on ebay. If you plan on selling the car you can look on ebay to see how much it is selling for. As far as looking a guide that gives advice on what to watch for, never came across anything like that. It all comes down to your knowledge about vehicles and your experience.

PunxRaHuaa	SpannerM is correct. You can drive it to a pre-booked MOT test without a current MOT cert or tax (Section 44 of the The Motor Vehicles Testing Regulations 1981 if you're interested). No stipulation is given to distance, only that the vehicle is insured and is driven directly there.<br>  However, many people are wary of doing this, especially when you get conflicting advice from places such as this. I would say that if you have any doubts ring VOSA (0300 123 9000) and you'll get it direct from the horses mouth. At least if you ring them you'll get solid facts and not peoples personal opinions masquerading as facts.|`|mWZ9BXIdaa	It will be fine.

kvGHnEHjaa	the trickle noise is probably air bubbles flowing through your heater core, if you can find no other reason (4.0s like to crack heads and blow head gaskets) install a flow restrictor in one of the heater hoses, it will cut down on the noise and will not allow the coolant to flow fast enough to do any damage to the heater core. just guessing, but if it runs okay you probably need a purge flow sensor and solenoid, VERY common.|`|AA11170077	I had a Deville it would sound like water pouring out somewhere.

The arms have to be replaced and if not the bolts can break and the whole rack and pinion assy and arms have to be replaced.

h0nfy6VXaa	With my moms volume dial, there are two parts to the dial.  the foremost piece of the dial controls volume, while a small lever attached to the back of the dial actually controls where the sound is being focused on the speakers.  It took her a while to realize that she wasn't turning the volume up, but actually focusing the volume on different speakers.  try just touching the volume dial and rotating it rather than grabbing the whole thing.

fYUgURZmaa	Go military.    With some luck, you will get paid training, fly the coolest planes and after many thousand flying hours, be offered a job in all major airlines.    The alternative is to pay for your tuition and flying hours, then work up your experience to 1,000 / 1,500 flying hours.    Ag-pilot: my opinion is that this activity will dwindle in the future (environmental concern, cost of flying against ground spraying, unavalaiability of the plane when the farmer needs it).    Corporate pilot: a friend of mine did that (retiring from the military to join Dassault Jet Services). He enjoyed every minute, flying guests to every nice spot in the world (Mauritius, Seychelles, Barbados, etc.) and being kept on wait sometimes for a whole week in all sort of beautiful places.    Freight carrier pilots: why are these often called "night dogs"? But you might have to go through this to gain valuable flying hours.    Commercial pilot: This might be out of jealousy (I am a PPL with some 200 hours time; could not afford more) but I often think of them as driving a bus with wings. Most of the flying is done by the aircraft, on planned schedules and there are so many rules and regulations you might even consider taking a law degree before training to fly.    Traffic pilot: a friend of mine did this (yes, another one) while gaining hours; but he had to purchase his own plane (cessna 206) and organise his flying on a contract basis. The outcome his, he is now flying commercial on a Bae146.    But do not worry, with patience and fortitude (with some financial help from your family and friends too), you can do it.|`|0Th3lvynaa	The best paying jobs would be Corporate Pilot, then Freight Pilot.  It also depends on your seniority.  The longer you are with a company, the more money you will make.  It take time to move up and make a lot of money.  Good Luck|`|fZjgIE9Baa	It entirely depends what you're looking for. I have no idea what you're looking for, so it's hard to tell what would be best for you. If you're looking to fly larger aircraft and people, be an airline pilot. If you are looking to fly freight in larger aircraft, be a cargo pilot. And the same for the rest.     In the long run, I'm pretty sure airline pilots get paid the most, but I'm not 100% sure. As a corporate pilot, your pay will increase more each year but will level off faster.|`|L1cBV8qQaa	777    Military:    F/a Super hornet|`|DvlwN9kdaa	Airline flying is not boring, tedious, or like driving a bus.    Flying at UPS, FedEx is not what you do to build experience.  Those carriers are among the very most selective.    Speak with some corporate pilots.    Ag flying can be very fatiguing.  I don't know about the money.      Traffic flying can get tedious.  The money is not there.    Speak with some helicopter pilots.|`|VyAHw76daa	1.) Corporate for the right flight department (state of the art large cabin, established department, NBAA or better compensation)    2.) FedEx/UPS    3.) Fractional, if you can stand the airlining. (Interesting that you don't mention fractional---thousands of pilots employed in that segment of the industry.)|`|DV4xyeChaa	F 15 strike eagle|`|2DcSOxCyaa	In the civilian world, agriculture.  No question about it. Don't let anyone tell you that corporate or airlines are better simply because of money.  Money has nothing to do with it, although there are some ag pilots that do better than some airline drivers, and take half the year off on top of it.  But for the pure simple love of flying, ag is the only way to go, in my humble opinion.  We have jobs that other people will stop what they are doing and just watch us work.  Can't get any cooler than that.

AA11609007	the most common problem would be a lifter noise. lifters make more of a ticking noise rather than a knock. if it is a knocking noise or a hammering it is probably a rod. my experience in dealing with knocking sound in a motor is that sound carries and its difficult to pin-point the location. even if it sounds like its behind the pulleys it could be on the opposite end of the engine. you may also check the belt and make sure that its tight and all the pulleys are in line and check all your fluid levels.|`|ef271f81fa66c3dae4f85371c82bddc5aa	You might be surprised to know that sometimes a bad belt can make a noise that sounds metal knocking against metal.|`|f408eee387d1a3cf1231983087607221aa	could be a lifter that has calapsed|`|AA10624071	Several factors can contribute to, or result in, engine knock. These factors include outdoor temperature extremes, altitude, humidity, operating under heavy engine loads, time elapsed between routine tune-ups, vehicle age, and manufacturing and engineering tolerances. The most common cause of engine knock is improper tuning of the engine, where the engine timing has deviated from the manufacturer's design specifications. This problem is easily resolved through proper routine maintenance and tune-ups. As a vehicle's engine ages, the octane required to prevent knock may increase. This condition is referred to as Octane Requirement Increase, or ORI, and is the result of normal engine wear. In instances where you experience occasional or moderate knocking, your first line of defense is to try a higher octane gasoline to accommodate this Octane Requirement Increase of your engine. Severe knocking, which cannot be remedied by using a higher octane grade of gasoline, demands your authorized mechanic's attention.

If it's a plain color just apply between sanding with 400-600 grit and rub out after about the 3rd coat (that depends on what you want). If metallic paint ,the last few coats have to be a little more precise as far as letting the metallic settle in a random way. Some people like to use a flow agent in the paint for the last coat on a metallic. This reduces the orange peel and almost eliminates sanding, taking you directly to the rubbing stage. When using a flow agent you have to spray more as if you were spraying an acrylic enamel as the paint will flow some after applying. In other words don't spray on too thick or it will run).|`|AA11603466	use paint|`|AA12140619	no|`|8b4b7257f99aa7453844e30ba950e978aa	Finger paint it. lol.|`|1ac7b06484f4a955e1c07b5816b369e8aa	just prep it and take it to maaco its cheapest

fccb192af4392213479ef0cf5ade519daa	One of the most difficult problems to diagnose can be caused by vacuum leaks. Vacuum leaks can cause problems on some or all cylinders, and leaks in vacuum lines can cause critical actuators to fail to respond.<br>  <br>  Vacuum leaks generally tend to fall at the end of the process of elimination in the diagnostic procedure. This means the vacuum leak is considered after eliminating the ignition, compression, fuel delivery and sensor problems. A time-consuming procedure at best.|`|AA10513491	you installed the rings upside down,|`|AA10757538	i have a crazy idea.. is your cam timeing wrong<br>  <br>  its my only idea basides a vacuum leak

bde2dfefe3b3735e7df46de59b123dc9aa	It depends on the make. If its a Power Stroke, it will pass emisions, Cummins will not in many cases, and Im not sure about the Duramax yet. Fuel economy will increase... Even in the Power Stroke. Maybe 18-22 total MPG even when towing. <br>  The mail notice will be power. And increase in horse power and torque will be very noticeable. Mostly on the Power Stroke and the Duramax. I am a Chevy guy myself, but I must say, I admire Ford for their participation on mods. You can go to certain vendors vor the Propane hook-up and still keep the motor under warranty. I hope this helps.

They usually have Chilton's, or Motors manuals. Read all the different steps prior to starting, and if you have a digital camera, take a few pictures along the way to help you locate parts.

That the wastgate system is malfuctioning....code 41 is cylinder select error and it can be caused by a wrong Mem CAL firmware in the ECM.   and 63 is Cruise Control  servo is not working.. <br>  <br>  Judging by this you may have a bad ECM in that car I would go to a junkyard and pick up a diffrent one that goes to that car. and see if the problems go away...  I bet someone put in a diffrent Mem CAL in it and its not for the car with the engine and transmission setup you have it can lead to the problems you got.  Most Chevy's and Pontiacs and Oldsmobile uses the Same ECM but diffrent software that stored for the MEM cal for different cars so they can use the same computer and not have to design diffrent Computer modules for other cars. they just have to change the Mem cal to make it work for different setup. And the Vacuum Modulator on GM hydramatic are known to go bad where transmission fluid is sucked into the Vacuum line and burn inside the engine which will make it smoke out of the exhaust. It would not hurt to replace that too.

Unless it says on your receipt that they put in lets say 5 quarts for example and you car only takes 4. then you may have a case.  But if the receipt has the correct amount on it it is just the dealers word against the oil change.  Most likely they will not admit if they did screw up and if you try to take them to court you will get crap out of it.  I would check the receipt for the amount they stated to be put in.  Then I would call or stop in and talk to the manager and see what he or she has to say.  If they stand their ground and you really believe they messed up then don't ever go back.  But don't discount all quick lubes.  Just like anything else there are good ones and bad ones.  You get a bad burger from McDonald's does that mean you will never go to another McDonald's any where.  Not fair for the quick lube industry.  Also dealers like to make quick lubes look bad whenever they can.

Your F150 has at least 250 HP and unless you plan to tackle unpaved or off road terrain, the job should be no problem on the truck.  We are assuming that it is in good condition and that you plan to use at least a 2 wheel car dolly or a full sized 4 wheel carrier which would be safest.  A tow hitch is OK for a small import or a lighter vehicle but driving 650 miles with a full sized REAL STEEL Chevy on a tow hitch can put you in for a whole world of problems.  Everything from the Highway Patrol to losing control and I am sure that the Impala is your baby;   I wouldn't use no cheapo on mine.

Of course, this is strictly my opinion and you'll find as many opinions as you get answers.

This can only happen in a bad movie.<br>  <br>  i believe wherever a high seas search is to be conducted, the short range helicopters deploy with supportive vessels to refuel and shelter the helicopter when needed.<br>  Apart from that, the high seas patrols are conducted with C130s and Seahawk/blackhawk variants that are equipped for in flight refuelling.<br>  <br>  after all, read your own links><br>  "Dolphin is usually deployed from shore but it can be deployed from medium and high endurance Coast Guard Cutters, as well as the Polar Icebreakers" wiki|`|a3ltifsjaa	Hi im guessing here regarding the colours..  it makes Sense to have orange helis because it stands out over the sea,when it was white it conflicted with waves and not so easy to spot hence the orange..Im sure in an emergency the american aircraft carriers would oblige anybody on a rescue mission permission to land to refuel you couldn't just aapproach and land ..chances are you wouldn't get close enough to land anyway..Best Regards Steve

5v1RV0Gxaa	I think the greatest weakness VW has is perception.<br>  <br>  VW, like all car companies has had it's issues with reliability on some models, recalls and design flaws and poor timing for certain vehicle launches - these are not issues that go away overnight and might take years to mend in the eyes of the consumers and media.<br>  <br>  Take for example VW launching the Tiquan, the compact SUV, it was really unfortunate that this launch happened to be in the midst of the highest gasoline prices ever... no one wanted to hear about anything like an SUV, despite the fact that it was a really great vehicle.<br>  <br>  The Phaeton was an engineering marvel that a company like BMW or Mercedes would have gotten great press for, instead the V12 luxury car simply was not able to change the way people thought about a Volkswagen. The car was doomed in terms of people not thinking that VW could build a car worthy of spending $80k on, but that same engine and technology put into an Audi A8 will sell, right?<br>  <br>  Then we get to the Routan. VW's minivan built on a Chrysler platform. It seems like a great idea right? Take the top selling minivan on the planet, and let Volkswagen designers and engineers analyze, deconstruct and test everything, and then put it all back together again. Ultimately, they transformed this seven-passenger minivan into something uniquely Volkswagen. But how many VW loyalists are going to want to drive a minivan? And how many Toyata and Honda minivan drivers are looking for a replacement or to switch brands, especially in this economy.<br>  <br>  VW Reliability. Some of the other answers are right. VW parts typically cost more than a Honda and certain vehicles that are on the road now in the 90k-100k mileage range are certainly cars that VW would like to have back. But the new line of VW's out are amazing, reliable and priced really well. But those cars will not be in the 90k milage range for another 6-8 years right? So VW has to weather the strorm and current perception of poor reliability due to some mistakes they made in the past. Oh yeah, did i mention that for the fifth consecutive year, Volkswagen Certified Pre-Loved has earned IntelliChoice’s “Best Non-Luxury Certified Pre-Owned Program” title. <br>  <br>  Otherwise, VW is in a great position. There sales numbers globally are great. The Clean diesel technology in cars like the Jetta TDI (named Green Car of the Year) has proven more environmentally friendly than a Prius (and much more fun to drive.) <br>  <br>  If VW can change the way people think about VW and survive any association with this current US Auto implosion, they will be fine. Trust me....|`|3cf54b98aab3159bdd02ab505ad9368eaa	WHICH Volkswagens.<br>  <br>  THe old air cooled ones have been running for hundreds of thousands of miles and are still going..<br>  <br>  The newer ones tend to run about 3 to 5 years and then cost a ton of money to repair.<br>  <br>  BUT.. having said that its all also a major effect of how you take care of them.|`|DyuXD9Evaa	well from experience they are hard to fix on your own...you notice how they brag about having more engineers than nasa...yeah they are putting half of them to work fabricating different wierd tools so you absolutely have to go back to them for even seemingly simple repairs|`|vgUwq9kFaa	I have a 2004 Jetta GTI and I love it.  I bought it used and it has no problems whatsoever.  I have used Volkswagens all my life and never experienced any major problems.|`|rDkRSmjJaa	I don't really agree with the answers listed above.  I have owned VW's for many years now.  These included many different models with all the different engines they offer.<br>  <br>  While they do have their problems, for example the coilpack problem that plagued all Mk4 1.8T's at some point in their life VW corrected it.<br>  <br>  Just like any car if you perform the necessary maintance at the correct times VW's can last a very long time.  I know many people with VW's, especially the diesels, that have over 200,000 miles on them!!!!<br>  <br>  One drawback is that they tend to be pricey when it comes to repairs.  So if that is an issue for you then look for a VW that is certified pre-owned as it will come with a long warranty.|`|iX7QbiOGaa	RELIABILITY!!!! The VW's are very bad in reliability and and because of this, there sales are down the drain. I used to have a 2003 VW Passat and at first, I really like it. Handles well, drives well, But, when it becomes old, everything starts to fall apart. I am not talking about major fixes,but little thing that really annoys you. Headlight, taillight, power windows, etc.. But I can tell you that it handles very well and if you like the handling of BMW or Mercedes, you will love this one.|`|EmgiGg17aa	That is a pretty generic question.   If VW was the first car you ever drove, then you would know how to drive it properly.    When you have driven other types of vehicles(one tends to transfer that style of driving over from one make to another) then you are going to have problems.  It goes both ways.    The way the car is built is different and  many mechanics hate to work on VW because it is different.   So they got to think different.  Some cannot.   The engine is removed from underneath the car- not pulled from above.  That is the way they were designed.   Take it out with a floor jack.   Things are taken right apart such as to drain the rad one must remove the lower rad hose(so the hose can be inspected as well as the thermostat) rather than the shortcut tap on the rad.<br>      Many parts were reuseable.   Door panels could come off and be put on multiple times because of reuseable clips (Chevy is a use once and buy new ones).<br>    Many parts were interchangeable no matter the year or the model within a certain number of years(sometimes up to 10 years-even longer).<br>  <br>  People liked that common sense approach.    Price  of repairs - same as any foreign car and yet you could do it yourself.    You can still find cheaper parts than the dealer charges(and that applies to all cars) I'm debating on the new cars whether that is possible with the electronic mumbo jumbo and computerization.  Unfortunately VW is following that groove too.  Cars are less people friendly.   And they still break down.<br>  <br>  However Vw still continues to grow buying up other companies such as Lamborgini.|`|sqEydCZVaa	Well VW has a consistent record of falling apart around the 90K mark where you put a bunch or work into it and then it breaks down every 20 to 30K after that.  VWs are a very impressive car when they are new nice finish quiet and over all nice.  BUT that soon all changes.  Its a perfect example of you get what you pay for.  We tech say VW Virtually Worthless and its no joke..

AA00000184	3 main components make up the price difference: supercharged 4.2L V8, brembo brakes, and the dynamic response package. slightly less important are things like 20" wheels/tires are standard and the SC weighs in about 200 lbs. heavier. but you're talking about a vehicle that's almost 3 tons. it won't drive like a sedan no matter what kind of engine/suspension you throw at it.<br>  <br>  the first cut most people look at are the options. things like sirius and the luxury package are standard on the SC model, but are optional on the HSE. adding up the desired options, you may find you're almost at the same cost if you optioned out the HSE so many will opt for the bigger engine. next thing is towing. almost everyone who needs a tow vehicle will opt for the SC. not that the HSE is shabby, but the extra ponies help. a lesser known consideration is offroading. there are few wheel/tire combos that will clear the brembo brakes so HSE has a slight nod in this regard.
3HSNFDaJaa	My husbands insurance runs out on 6th March and he already pays by direct debit.He got a letter telling him price etc for renewal and unless he contacted them it would be renewed automatically without having to do anything. I called them and cancelled the policy and the bank to cancel the direct debit because we got cheaper elsewhere.|`|9OX3sTDnaa	She would probably have gotten a letter from her old insurance company prior to the insurance running out saying that unless she tells them to cancel the insurance it would automatically be renewed. The letter would have stated the renewal price and the monthly charges. She probably didn't let them know to cancel the policy. This is normal practice with car insurance renewal.|`|gjUpsUZAaa	To add to the previous answer, your friend must have set up a direct debit for the old insurer. They cannot do so of their own volition. <br>  <br>  She needs to contact the old insurer immediately to correct the situation, and then to contact her bank to cancel the direct debit mandate.|`|dyIyJqauaa	They couldn't have set up a direct debit without her first giving the company her account information and she must have also signed some kind of a consent form.  I can guarantee you that they didn't simply find all the acccount information and forge a consent form on their own without her knowledge.

Who's fault should it be that you didn't do the math for YOUR contract on your car with your budget?|`|2ee9ba3f8fa52a8c3bd583c6f12f11b8aa	Your problem is not the 25 pounds.  Your problem is that you would basically sell your soul to have a shiny new car, before you even pay off the last one.  As long as you are like that, it won't matter much whether you get ripped off or not.  If you work hard your whole life, you might be able to help a number of other people be rich.  <br>  <br>  If you aren't willing to think for yourself, you shouldn't expect much out of life.|`|zJUXsRlGaa	Next time take your calculator.

Apart from a fine and penalty points, the court could seize your car and crush it (you then get sent the bill for the crushing, to add insult to injury).|`|nYRkAmdtaa	Spare ? no it is not safe , and you can damage the rim and loose the wheel .|`|5FVyVS9vaa	No. There will be nothing left of the tire and you run the risk of a fire.|`|1hciyvKdaa	5 mph,  depending on how low, I may or may not totally destroy the tire and possibly the rim, I see it all the time on freeways, you know where there is no exit, get a ticket for it? Possibly, leave emergency blinkers on the entire time.  If the tire doesnt pop by the time you get to the destination, once filled get it looked at by a tire shop, because damage to the side walls could cause it to explode and lose control of the car. Make sure to stay clear of the tire while filling it, they can explode during filling from the damage also, stay well clear, it can kill you.

An underinflated tire can cause any number of problems in the first hundred feet of a trip, just as easily and readily in the last part of a five, ten, fifteen or hundred mile trip.  If it is a dangerous condition, it is dangerous NOW, and a short trip does not make it less dangerous.|`|oLz4jYXqaa	If it's not punctured you should be able to inflate it and it would be cheaper than having to buy a new tyre. If it is completely deflated, you are almost certain to ruin it by driving for 15 miles. Even if it's not shredded, it would be unsafe in future for high speeds. Buying a foot pump (￡2.99) is cheaper.|`|XmD61yBpaa	Yes it is relatively safe as long as you go well under the speed limit, - this may be of some annoyance to other road users so I would advise you to do the necessary driving out of rush hour, the only damage will be slight and to the tyre which you should replace as soon as possible.|`|ab226445523dd359acfc93c66ef57424aa	Not at all.

THERE ARE TWO POSSIBLE QUESTIONS IN THIS WITH SLIGHT MODIFICATION. FORGIVE ME FOR THIS BUT I HAVE ANSWERED BOTH.<br>  ___________<br>  i).... <br>  WHEN ONE OF THE REAR TYRE OF THE CAR IS UNDER INFLATED:<br>  It is safe upto the limit... Because the entire weight of your car is distributed to all the wheels. The problem arives when you have load in the boot. Because most of the load of the vehicle is on the both the rear wheels.... If one of the rear wheels is under inflated then it is obvious that there is more load on the other rear wheel. So It is better to drive slowly and reach the destination before other tyres get punctured.<br>  <br>  The other problems are..<br>  <br>  1) If cops notices it then you are pulled away from the road and pay the huge penalty.<br>  <br>  2) Always the Car is associated with three moments. Pitching, rolling and yawing moments. Since a tyre is under inflated, there may be uneven forces on the vehicle which diminishes the comfert level and you will get exhausted.<br>  <br>  If one of the rear tyre is under inflated then try to shift the luggage to the front of the tyre.<br>  __________<br>  II)...<br>  WHEN ONE OF THE REAR CARS TYRE IS PUNCTURED...<br>  <br>  When one of the rear cars tyre is punctured, you need not to worry. Because rear cars tyre is not proper and your car tyre which is ahead of that is working properly.... You can continue your drive...<br>  <br>  All the best<br>  Bye..<br>  Hope this helps you.<br>  __________|`|6vU6Xuokaa	The vast majority of road accidents happen with in five miles of a driver's home so the shortness of your journey isn't going to help. If the tyre is flat, driving it will damage the rim of the wheel.

hm6HQvqNaa	Yes- you did fine. Once the leak is repaired your mechanic should check your coolant protection level because you diluted it a little. they usually do that automatically when they refill it. If there is a large loss of antifreeze you are better off to fill at the radiator but you want to let the engine cool before opening the cap because steam coming out of an overheated engine will scald . Also steam trapped in the upper part of the cooling system will make the gauge erratic.|`|dZUdVH0eaa	Aren't you supposed to drink it?|`|GFqt7Eawaa	sounds like a leak.. if you keep having to add more and more... it temporary brings engine temps down to normal when there is coolant in the system, then it leaks out and you add more and temps go down and on and on.. leak or blow head gasket which means your burning it.. put white towel or something that will show green drips on it very noticeably under your car let it run for a while and check for leaks.. if no leaks then its most likely a head gasket|`|v0PYtEt7aa	To me it seems like your water pump, your rad, or thermostat is gone. you will most likely to to replace one of the three.<br>  <br>  when filling your anti-freeze you need to fill the plastic container and normally you should check the cap on the rad. but you should NEVER open it when the vehicle is hot because the antifreeze sprays everywhere and it could hurt you. What you did was right, you just need to have it looked at...don't drive it anymore.. you don't want to seize your engine or anything.<br>  <br>  Good luck! and good job|`|ea207ed5b6ef75b8f1362932a6abf174aa	Thermostat could be going bad.

nP92OdBzaa	I subscribe to Consumer Reports and their reliability rating for the RX8 was average. To compare, most Hondas, Acuras, Toyotas and Lexus have a very good or excellent reliability rating.  The ratings are from the actual people that own the cars. It didn't say anything that they had problems in the heat. They said the car is fun to drive but the gas mileage is not the best|`|ZG4AeRQAaa	Pro: blast to drive, handles well, rotary engine, probably can get a very good deal on them.    Con: older models had trouble with engines getting flooded during starting (several computer upgrades seem to fixed that problem), poor gas mileage, compromise for getting into back seat with partial doors.    However, I never extend myself financially to buy a car.|`|pJxC6OyKaa	If your looking for a reliable, good looking car. i would get it. But If you dont want to maitince it a alot it wont be so reliable. The rx8's rotary engine needs to be checked up on often, i mean like every three months just for a checkup. The cars a little touchy but its a blast and turns heads.
AA10498232	First of all your not forced to do anything you don't want to do! If you don't like your job quit! That's what great about this country! Your free do do what's right for you! But look around the world doesn't stop for snow and the next job will require you to come to work even if it snows! So I would put some extra weight in the car for traction some extra clothes in back to keep you warm in case you have to get out and shovel a bit. People are counting on YOU! If your not up the the challenge give the boss notice and move on.|`|XLXncQu9aa	You may have to get another job.  I know that isn't the easiest thing to do especially the way the world economy is right now.  However, you have to think realistically.  If your manager will not put your safety first, then he/she is not looking out for your best interest.  They need to put your safety first.  You should not drive in wintry weather because it is hazardous.  You can end up in a terrible accident that was weather related.  Seriously, consider getting another job or just live with the one you have currently.  However I think it would be best to tell your manager how it is not safe to drive in that type of weather.  If they won't put your safety first as an organization then you need to look out for yourself.|`|e08eab35a22f0c6bf7f5ba2c6c22c1f9aa	don't do it, if this boss will fire you 2morrow nothing will happen to him, tell him you can not drive or your car broke down and there is no transportation.|`|Dsgpsbndaa	If your boss's are arseholes. find a better job whee you are appritiated?|`|jFwuiRKxaa	You have a choice live with it or get another job.|`|75NM6Zhtaa	Being a carer can understand the predicament,your employers would be in as well,people dependant about someone turning up to help them.I live in an extremely rural area nearest store is 90 mile round trip ,nearest  centre 224 miles round trip.  Last year I decided living and working in this area I needed a vehicle which could hopefully handle most adverse weather conditions,ok,my car is not new it is not small but it does give me 4x 4 capability.  I think your employer should have tried and  covered some of your calls to lighten your load in these weather conditions   however dependent vulnerable people needed you as well.In this situation I honestly feel that there should have been some common sense from your employers side and left you to cover maybe the  calls closer to home.  I have people dependent on me to go to work as well so understand your predicament,If I  to was unable to  go to work because of weather my employers (a council ) would not be happy either.|`|ysclTmCoaa	Due to the nature of your work, your employers are absolutely correct.    Your job involves driving to your clients, they can't be expected to go without assistance because their carer doesn't feel confident in the snow.    You have several choices, move closer to the area in which you work, buy a better vehicle, take extra driving tuition or get another job.    Don't blame your lack of confidence on other people.

JC whitney has almost every part you would need.|`|y1beZ4xOaa	Hi, you have already made the first step by deciding which car you want to restore. May i suggest that if you get a mustang, try to make sure it has the original 289 windsor, they were a good motor with a few little modifications. The web is such a handy thing to  have when you want to know something, you don't even necessarily need to pick up a book. After getting your car, pull it apart to find any rust patches etc, alot of those cars lived in California where sea air had the chance to attatch its little nastys to the parts not often washed. After the body is all sorted, concentrate on the interior, send seats away to be reupholstered etc. All that is left then is the motor and running gear, once these things are done you are pretty much free to enjoy a great machine. Be sure to replace all rubbers (doors, boot etc).|`|HDA8Lxv4aa	67 mustangs are nice but are expensive if you want a fastback which is what most want. dont make the mistake i did. Forget the original engine. its so much work to restore an engine and not worth the performence they give. Look into roush crate engines. they come assembled all u have to do is hook it up to the tranny which i would also change to a ford AOD or a T5. dome some research on restomod. i have a classic mustang and im restoring but youll find out very quickly that these cars were never that good. the power is ok, the transmissions are crap for freeway use, the suspension is crap and they are uncomfortable beacuse of the live axle. but they do look good. most people restore a car for them self not to sell so look into restomod. as far as the skills required go to your local community college sign up for financial aid and take the mechanic classes. most of the time they let you work on your car with there tools.
Bl9zcqxQaa	This is a very common issue here in Michigan, we seem to get Ford Trucks and Vans in our shop all the time a day or two after a big rain or snow storm. Or, if the vehicles been parked for a little while.  The problem is moisture. The way the ignition systems are set up, each cylinder has a coil mounted on top the spark plug which is in a "hole" on top of each cylinder, water collects on that hole and causes a misfire, which in turn is why your truck runs bad and the light is flashing.  Have a technician check it out soon, as letting it go too long can cause the catalytic converter to go bad with too much unburned fuel being dumped into the cat.    Sometimes the problem can be fixed with just cleaning the moisture from the coils/boot assemblies, other times, the problem could end up involving replacing 1 or more coil assemblies.   Keep in mind, Tune-ups for these trucks are very expensive, as access to the coils and plugs are very difficult, so dont be suprised with an estimate of over 3-400 dollars.  Good luck|`|TqPpsGqvaa	You need to have your truck put on a scanner to see whats going on.They will also be able to tell you whey your acceleration is slow.Take it in to the mechanic you use.

Panic not.|`|NrKD11vaaa	There have been 'horror' stories as mentioned, but there aren't many situations where doing as you've said would increase your chance of fatality/additional injury. <br>  <br>  I strongly recommend getting a 'tail pack', it's a soft zip up bag that stays on the pillion seat of your bike. It's secured with a velcro strap that goes underneath the seat and has additional 'tie down' clips, Oxford do one and I'm on my third. Recently it carried over a UK gallon of oil, well over a gallon of bike cleaner and three big catalogues, no problem!<br>  <br>  A true 'danger' fact is wearing steel toe cap boots, especially in cold conditions. A rider can fall off and the toe cap effectively amputates the larger toes.

And if it gets caught on somthing could split your insides as you will suddenly  stop from sliding at 30-60mph to zero.<br>  The injuries you could get would be similar to wearing a lap belt in a car.<br>  I would find a way to wrap the chain around the bike, or  wear a ruck sack. You could put the  hain in a bag and bungie it to the bike.

They invented big rig trucks. Ford is good if their drivetrain would get better. Fords transmissions are the worst, my company (that i work for), went through 4 transmissions last year with our Ford trucks.

WrXY4Wm9aa	A freight pilot is a commercial pilot.|`|1f8667fa7bae46c3ffc3ff576f55d53baa	First of all, Freight Pilots ARE Commercial pilots.  Any time you get paid to fly an airplane you are acting as a commercial pilot.  A passenger airline pilot carries passengers.    Second, (and here's the most common answer on Y!A) "It Depends"    Pilots that fly for what is called a 135 freight operator generally make less than people who fly passengers for airlines, and it is considered more of an "entry-level" type of job.  However, the pilots at FedEx and UPS do quite well and actually make more than their conterparts at Delta, United, and American.    The general rule of thumb goes something like this:  Pay is commensurate with the size of the airplane flown.  A 747 pilot will make more than someone who flies a Citation nearly regardless of what type of stuff is sitting in the back.  Of course there are always exceptions (Kalitta pays nearly nothing to the people who fly their 747s while some places pay quite well for bizjet drivers) however, the important part is to recognize that its the career track you are on that determines your pay rate, rather than whether or not your cargo is human that determines your relative pay rate.

Your car should absolutely not be quiet with no muffler, cat or not!     While you're at it, you may want to consider this as an opportunity to put a good exhaust system on your car - you may find a clean, new cat will put a lot more noise out of the tail pipe!|`|8Be0iMN5aa	I have an 89 camaro wish i had a 76.

So it's not wise to mess around.|`|AA11293043	I'm sure there are a few tall ones in there, especially the 'noise abatement' cliche and other calls ("last time I visited Frankfurt was during the war and I didn't land" etc) that get rehashed on every aviation site that thinks it's funny.    However I've heard some very amusing, tongue-in-cheek exchanges -- mainly with Tower on the dispensing end. I think the bottom line is, if there's time to add stuff like "Don't make your approach any lower or I'll report you to Parks & Wildlife for damage to koalas" and it won't adversely affect safety, then it is a welcome bit of light relief during a tough day.|`|mR5ZtjqWaa	usually, the smaller the airport gets, the more funny stuff you'll hear on the radios.    when i'm operating at CYUL, it's all business, sometimes french, but mostly english communication. I only know one controller there, and he works the night shift, so, no familiar voices. But the day ground controllers know that I fly for RCAC, and they might gimme a heads up when they see the bus load of cadets pulling up and that's about it.    at CYHU though, where there are a lot of private pilots, we joke around some, the tower is lots more easy going, all the "resident" pilots know each other by their first names, and sometimes we get wilder and jokes keep on pouring in. Sometimes they're crude everyday jokes, but mostly, its more technical jokes or teasing, like when we know X pilot just spent 3 hours fixing a really simple problem, causing him to miss a group fly off or something.|`|10af4993fcb827d6fabb27f05cba2be5aa	I think alot of the "conversations" are made up, but some just happen that are just funny.      I was landing a small aircraft behind a C130 at a shared airport in North Texas one day. I thought I was far enough back, I really wasn't, the wind was blowing about 25-30 knots, I carried too much power for the landing. I touched down 4 times. Not my best effort at all!  As I turned off the active the tower said "Nxxx contact ground on .25 and you really only need three for currency."   I replied "ground on .25, I just wanted to be sure, can y'all you sign the log."    There are some things that just occur, and some are funny.     Sometimes its necessary to break the tensions.|`|4bGQpFB3aa	Some are but when you've been flying through lousy weather for 4 days you need a break.  No profanity (expect for the "who said bull**it one) and little sexual reference.    There was chick in the Iraq No-Fly Zone, when asked to connect the Viper CAP to the incoming 4-ship said, "I can't give you HEAD on this frequency" (that being the callsign on the incoming flight.  She was never heard from again, probably because she died of embarassment when she figured out what she said.

BBzCFT0raa	The best thing to do is find a wrecked srt8 with a perfectly good working motor and do an engine swap. But if you want to use your existing engine, then I would say check out <a href="http://www.flowmastermufflers.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.flowmastermufflers.com/</a> for your exhaust. As for the intake, I would assume the stock intake would be adequate because you aren't running a turbo or supercharger. But if you desperately feel the need to get an intake then check out <a href="http://www.knfilters.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.knfilters.com/</a> and see if they have an air filter for your motor. There really isn't too much you can do with a 2.7L V6. I would advise against the hood scoop, because it really isn't serving any purpose and it really won't look very good. If anything get a carbon fiber hood, at least then you are attempting to save weight. As for the sound system, I would definitely invest in that because you will get a lot more use out of it. I would also suggest tinting the windows and changing the rims/tires so you could get some wider rubber on there to get more grip.|`|N7LlOAcOaa	DONT put anything shelby cobra under the cap.

30cde0d4b442be793ca7d19e51bb8d0faa	NO!!!!i got an 04 and i cant wait to get rid of it.  the most cheaply built thing i have ever owned.  total junk|`|QdzecSwdaa	No Way!   I owned a 2001 ranger, by the time it hit 90K it was having tons of issues.  Almost all my miles were highway also, which it even more pathetic.  I have owned 4 Fords, 1991 Ranger, 1996 Explorer, 2000 Excursion, and the 2001 ranger, as the years went on the quality dropped a ton,  Every one except the 2001 Ranger needed a tranny rebuild at least 1 time, the 1991 twice.  <br>  I will never ever ever ever buy another ford as long as I live.  I am a Toyota guy after the first one I bought.  Never again will I make the mistake of buying any of the big 3   TOYOTA!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|qjg0g5WMaa	yes great truck reliable with good power<br>  good luck|`|SLcZatQBaa	In comparison to the Kia you have now you will be able to carry more, more power, and greater availability for parts whenever you need to replace something.  Also, the Ranger has a lot of enthusiast backing for them.  I got a lot of my maintenance-know-how from the two sites below.  I own a 2003 Ranger Edge 3.0L 4x2 automatic.  It's a great truck, too.  The guy that decided to go Toyota probably ragged the heck out of his Fords to make them problematic.  Check out the sites below before you buy and maybe read up on common issues and what upgrades you can do to it to bring out the fun factor in the Ranger.|`|ee9d868437061c481764a5b3ec48f5bbaa	I would get it.

You may have an UNDER heating engine.  The gauges in tarsus's are very unreliable.  <br>  If you have the 3.8 motor is highly likely the heads and or head gaskets have failed.  More likely of the two is the heads are eroded in the combustion chamber right around the valve seats.|`|hah4QjZKaa	Have the system flushed; you have reduced flow through the heater core. They may have to run some solution thru it to dissolve the build-up.

9f0d91cec2d4d63ac0132c10f166968baa	I think the 2004.5-2005 GLI is the best looking car Volkswagen has ever made. This is the car that got me hooked on VW and now I work for them!|`|rDkRSmjJaa	They are pretty much the same car just with a different body.  Both have exactly the same engine and will take the same exact mods, with the same exact performance gain.<br>  <br>  It all comes down to whether you perform a sedan or a hatchback.  I have owned 2 VW hatchbacks, a 2002 GTI 1.8t and a 2004 R32.  Hatchbacks are great, especially for hauling around large items.<br>  <br>  Also I would skip on the CAI.  They don't provide much as far as gains go, just provides the cool turbo swoosh noise.
UycnSRXbaa	Like you said, engine mounts, could also be the transmission mounts, (there is 2 of them on top)<br>  <br>  I have seen Drive shaft couplings become soft and do the same as you mentioned.  They get soft because the engine and transmission leak fluid on it and then it becomes soft and slightly flexible.
i5Y320Wraa	Are you sure the beetle is all original? The car is over 30 years old and someone at some point may have made some changes to it to make it look older than it actually is. This could have been done for personal reasons or even repairs to the car and they used what parts they had available. My bug is a '72 bug and I've got some things done to it that older beetles had but this one doesnt. Just because I wanted the other option.|`|EmgiGg17aa	It is a Type 1.   111(regular flat windshield) or 113(curved window SuperBeetle)     German specs are the same.  ( Km is in Canada too.)    The Type 1(its official name) was made left hand drive and right hand drive.   Pictures are never 100% especially on the interiors   As a lot of the VW's were the same style they save on shooting the picture of the same car over and over.    You can probably go to the dealership and inquire about a mile odometer and after you fall on you azz when you hear the price - go check at an auto salvage yard and ask them for what years cross over on that part and switch it     yourself. saving hundreds of thousands in coin. Serial number is found on the dashboard drivers side when you look through the windshield on a little black metal strip.(body type 111 or 113|`|32NNhLzEaa	Go to:<br>  <a href="http://www.thesamba.com/vw/archives/manuals/75bug_canada.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.thesamba.com/vw/archives/manu...</a><br>  <br>  Thats another owners manual for your year so you can compare and contrast. By the way, the basic car was the same whether or not it went to the German market or the US market. The difference (besides the driver on the right) was the fact that US spec beetles were considered "deluxe" models I.E. Lots more chrome trim, more "goodies" for the market. I am curious on how your dash looks because bugs of your year only came with 2, the small padded and the large padded that would have housed an airbag in the later years.|`|AawNVRAsaa	is your windshield flat or curved? Flat would be a standard beetle and curved would be super beetle. they made both in '75 and the owners manual may be different. Or there is only one manual covering both and you are looking at subsections for one when you have the other?
adbc05b25fb5ee9cfa0f48d2028a46e6aa	I hate to tell you this but; $500.00, will only buy you someone else's problems.  I would recommend that you go talk with a Hyduani dealer and explain the problem your having.  If you can afford $200.00 a month they will put in a brand new car and if you find that you can not afford it in the first year they will take it back and call it a square deal with no poor credit report against you.  Sound to me that you need a dependable vehicle and with going to college you or your parents will be able to write off .37 cents per mile to and from college on taxes.  That could pay for the vehicle in one year.  If you drove 100 miles per week to and from school it would be $148.00 per week write off on taxes; or $592.00 per month at say 10 months would be $5,920.00 a year write off as transportation expenses to and from school.  At that rate $9,000.00 car would pay for itself in 1.5 years.  Thank about it and advise your parents of the tax credits.  Good Luck.|`|APfetCzAaa	I would suggest maybe a Honda Civic or a Toyota Carolla.

AA10346371	I know of no place that sells a complete rebuild kit for this.  But the Dillon Brothers website sells the individual parts you will need.  You will mostly want all the replacement gaskets you can get and the float needle valves and seats. They sell both the gaskets and the float valves as a set.  You should also give your carburetors a good inspection and order any additional parts as needed.<br>  <br>  I hope you have a service manual.  It will have complete step by step instructions to rebuild and set your carburetors.  It is very important that you synchronize the carburetors after you reinstall them or your engine will not run very well.  A service manual will have the complete procedure.<br>  <br>  Clymer sells a service manual for this bike for only $22.72 + shipping.  This will be a very good investment to make for your bike if you don't already have one.  It will have complete step by step instructions to correctly do almost any maintenance task on your bike.

gjUpsUZAaa	The only possibility is to see a lawyer about appealing against the length of the original ban. Having said that, a twenty year ban would only have been awarded after very careful consideration of what must have been an extremely serious offence or after a long run of continual offending, and even if you could get it reduced your chances of getting insured afterwards would probably be zero.<br>  <br>  If you serve more than half your ban as a model citizen, you can apply to the court for a reduction but you'd need to have compelling reasons to stand any chance of success.<br>  <br>  Your only other choice is to move abroad, perhaps north of the border or across the Irish Sea to the UK where your Irish ban does not apply. If you gain a UK licence though, you'll still be banned from driving in Eire. Don't delay though: the European Union is considering proposals to make driving convictions in one member state applicable to all member states, but those who already reside and drive in other member states would be unlikely to be affected.|`|dyIyJqauaa	Where I live, 20 years means 20 years and not 5 years.

RbsRpcIyaa	This is a very common scam being run on Craigslist, eBay, Autotrader, etc. <br>  <br>  The car was probably priced WAY under it's actual value, right? That's the hook to get you to inquire about it. <br>  <br>  As mentioned before, Yahoo! (nor eBay, sometimes used in place of Yahoo! on these scams) will never act as an escrow service. They tell you right up front. So does eBay. <br>  <br>  You send the wire transfer, the scammer empties that account and moves on. It happens every day. The so-called "waiting period" where you "test" the car never happens. Why? The escrow service doesn't exist, and the scammer has free reign to take that cash out of the account. <br>  <br>  Once this scam occurs, less than 1% of the monies lost is ever recovered.

Also on the other hand if you're out of coolant and your car overheats you can warp some very critical parts and cause another very bad breakdown.

All cars have to go through a series of tests called type approval to be used in  the EU and these tests have only approved this car for 4. Any more than people in the car would invalidate the insurance.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps

e9bv4ijlaa	I've worked as a detailer for 25 years it's an alright job, it's not a hard job to learn should be plenty of places to work. Most places train people,if you have your car licence that may help, wages vary some places pay wages anywhere between$13 to $20 perhour some pay per car i live in Western Australia|`|DqbOMkSyaa	you can earn between 5 to 7 dollars per day visit <a href="http://automobilesltd.blogspot.com/search/label/2008%20Suzuki%20Hayabusa" rel="nofollow">http://automobilesltd.blogspot.com/searc...</a>
bqLvWpcZaa	The reason they're charging you that much is because the seat has to come out and you have to remove the lower seat cover from the frame.  The SRS recognition pad is underneath the cover.  It's not an easy job...|`|d0231dcc170bb0de07aee5020b49aeeaaa	Can't you over ride it so the system thinks that the seat is occupied, that is disconnect and reconnect the two wires that go to it together, if you can do that then you will save ￡400.|`|qxDYjI16aa	I agree with Jay P.<br>  The passenger seat needs to be removed and seat cushion stripped down.<br>  After all that the fault code would have to be reset.|`|DqbOMkSyaa	visit this website <a href="http://automobilesltd.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://automobilesltd.blogspot.com</a>
d9e2487b31d689d39d86febebcf9023eaa	Spend a little money and buy a consumer report auto book.They even cover used cars. <br>  Without knowing your budget it is hard to recommend.  <br>  Get the newest car you can afford because they will be the best equipped safety wise usually and have the least amount of use on them.  Buy the best car available not necessarily the best looking !<br>  Preferably a four door because that will make it much easier to get the children in and out of their backseat childseats. <br>  If you are going to use it for short and long trips you don't want it to be too old and used.<br>  Buy it from a reputable dealer, not a person. If you intend to buy it from an individual take the car to a shop and have them check it.<br>  Insurance is a hard thing to tell. It depends so much on where you live, your driving record, the type of car, etc.<br>  RELIABLE<br>  ECONOMICAL (remember used cars especially old ones can get expensive in more ways than just gas)<br>  CHEAP TO INSURE<br>  SHORT AND LONG TRIPS<br>  You have described everyones idea of the perfect used car.<br>  Take someone who KNOWS cars with you to help you buy.<br>  Good Luck|`|xDPQ700baa	A good consideration is also the tax band. This can be a scare if you buy the wrong one and are unaware. Run choices through the link below. Our 1.6 diesel fiesta is ￡35 a year.<br>  <br>  But remember, cheaper to buy might cost more in the long run to keep on the road.<br>  <br>  ETA try second link, my mistook.<br>  <br>  ETA 2. Third link seriously worth considering. Might cost a few pounds but could save you thousands from hidden crash histories and outstanding finance etc on second hand cars.|`|L75kWYehaa	My daughter has a young baby and has a Ford Focus 4 door.  Lots of room in the seating area itself and masses of room in the boot for everything plus the kitchen sink that you have to take out when you have young children.  If you purchase something a bit older you may find the road tax is around ￡150, whereas the newer models are cheaper, and I think they've brought a model out currently where the emissions are so low that the road tax is only ￡35.  The 1.6 model rather than the 1.8 would be cheaper.|`|4biGrjPkaa	You havn't given us an Idea of what price you'd like to pay so heres a few suggestions.<br>  <br>  ￡1000 - Corsa or Fiesta<br>  ￡2000 - Focus or Astra<br>  ￡3000 - Toyota corolla, Honda civic, VW golf.<br>  <br>  You'll have less hassle with the above models than any peugeot/citroen/renault/fiat.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|6JEgauSdaa	Well personally i would recommend something german. Get a nice diesel engine. We have had many german cars in our family last few years and i must say they are by far superior to the majority of manufactures. I mean when i turned 17 i my dad bought me a Peugeot 306. I mean its a great first car, but the last year i had it, well its not amazing put it that way. However if your in a budget i would defiantly recommend getting a diesel, they are more expensive to buy but for a reason. A by far superior engine. Great fuel consumption, now a days they are incredibly fast too. Try get a few year old Audi A4 or A3 if you have a family and can get very sporty model too. Nice reliable car, good looking and to be fair not a bad price if you get a few year old model. Believe me you get alot for you money even in the older models =].
CYCIlR7Eaa	If you are a avid motorcyclist and a want to be bike builder, building a custom bike on a budget, should seem very interesting and exciting. The best deal in my opinion is the Kikker "HardKnock" 5150 Bobber kit which starts under $1500.00, which is shipped in 4 boxes and can be assembled in 4-8 hours. The bobber can be easily be made street legal, it is a kit will will have to be registered with your state and also comes with a MSO - ( Manufacture State of Origin ). The MSO will help in the process in receiving a state title.<br>  <br>  The kit had two choices for engine sizes- 125cc, 4-stroke engine with a semi-auto 4-speed transmission. Also a 200cc, 4-stroke with a semi-auto 5-speed transmission. More standard features include jockey shift & forward foot controls, kick & electric start, front and rear disk brakes, springer front suspension, which is only on the 125cc model. It has a top speed 57 miles per hour- 110cc model and 70-75 miles per hour- 200cc model. It is 80" long and has a seat height 25".|`|X4O7W1Vvaa	Look for a different make. Ducati's tend to have a lower seat height than most.|`|XpKY04Tnaa	Whole lot of stuff going on with this question. <br>  <br>  Look into aftermarket suspension parts. You can low or raise your bike my changing the front springs and rear shocks. Of course your changing the performance of the bike when you do that.|`|d0231dcc170bb0de07aee5020b49aeeaaa	A manufacturer will not modify a bike for one person at least not normally as it is not profitable, if you are looking for a 125 model try the chopper range, these are usually low seat models unlike a motor cross model that tend to be high, Honda, Suzuki and Yamaha do some very nice looking models that are really good to look at as well, you can also find Aprilla and some Chinese makes as well, but I would stick with the tried and tested Japanese makes.|`|mWZ9BXIdaa	I doubt it would be too big anyway, they are very small as bikes go. Though being inexperienced it may feel big and daunting to you.<br>  <br>  It's posible to lower a bike a in a few ways. Reprofiling or replacement seat, different suspension dog bones, some bikes have ride height adjustment on the forks and shock.|`|AA11119636	you can have the dealership / shop ... custom the shocks/springs for you and buy a set of lowering links for the bike<br>  <br>  or just get a cruiser|`|AA10346371	The major manufacturers will not custom build a bike for you.  You may find a custom bike shop that will build one for you, however a custom built bike will be quite expensive.<br>  <br>  For someone your size, the most important thing to consider is seat height.  You have to be able to balance the bike while stopped in traffic.  Best if you can sit and put both feet flat on the ground.  With a seat too high, you will only be able to put one foot on the ground.  You may be forced to lean the bike to the side and can easily lose your balance and drop the bike.  This could be dangerous in traffic.  At the very least, it will be embarrassing.  This could also be a problem when you take your motorcycle license road test.<br>  <br>  There are lowering kits available for some bikes, but these can cause problems.  They change the suspension geometry and can cause handling problems.  The reduced ground clearance can cause the bike to drag the pavement in corners, which can cause loss of control.  The lower suspension can cause the tire to rub the fender.  The kick stand will need to be altered.  You can also lower the seat height a little bit by shaving some of the cushion from the seat.  However, this can cause comfort issues, especially on longer rides.<br>  <br>  Honda Shadow VLX.  It has a seat height of 25.6".  This is a small cruiser.  This is a 538 CC liquid cooled V-twin.  It should have plenty of power for you.  They sold new for $5500.  2007 was the last year Honda made these.  You may be able to find a good used one.<br>  <br>  If you want something more in an upscale cruiser, there is the Harley Davidson Sportster 883 Low and the 1200 Low.  The 883 Low has a seat height of 25.3".  They sell for about $7000.  The Sportster 1200 Low has a seat height of 26.3".  These sell for about $9800.<br>  <br>  The Buell Blast is something a little different.  With its optional low profile seat, it has a seat height of 25.5".  These sell new for about $4795.  The optional low seat is an additional $111 for a total of $4906.  This bike has a 492CC single cylinder engine.  It also has a belt drive for less maintenance.  This is considered a sport bike.  These are usually sold through Harley Davidson dealerships.<br>  <br>  The Honda Shadow Aero has a seat height of 25.9".  This bike is considered a cruiser.  It has a 745CC V-Twin.  This has a fairly large engine for a small bike.  These cost about $7000.<br>  <br>  If you want something with a smaller engine, the Honda Rebel has a 234CC parallel twin engine.  It has a 26.6" heat height.  They go new for about $3400.  They have been around a while so you might be able to find a good used one.  This is also considered a small cruiser.<br>  <br>  The Yamaha Star V-Star 250 might be acceptable with a seat height of 27".  This is a cruiser style V-twin.  However, this may be pushing the limit for someone with short legs.  These sell new for about $3800.<br>  <br>  The Suzuki GZ 250 is considered a standard bike.  This bike has a 27.8" seat height.  It has a 250 CC single cylinder engine.  This bike may also be pushing the limits for someone with short legs.  These sell for about $3500.<br>  <br>  The Honda Night Hawk has the same 234CC parallel twin engine as the Honda Rebel, but has a higher seat at 29.3".  This may be too high.<br>  <br>  Some people might say the Kawasaki Ninja 250R.  However, this bike has a seat height of 30.5".  This would be a poor choice for someone with short legs.  These sell for about $4000 - $4100.<br>  <br>  Honda now makes a bike similar to the Ninja 250.  It's called the Honda CRF230M.  It has a 223CC single.  They call it a sport bike but I think it looks more like a cross between a sport bike and a standard bike.  This bike has a seat height of 31.9 inches, making it a poor choice for someone with short legs.  They also sell the CRF230L, which is almost the same bike with similar dimensions and seat height, but the CRF230L is about $200 cheaper.  Looks like the only difference between the two are the tires and rims.  The CRF230M has street tires and the CRF230L has street - trail tires.<br>  <br>  Most of the bikes that I mention here have been around for a few years.  If your budget does not allow for a new bike, you may be able to find one of these used.  You could look in the classified section of your local newspaper.  Also, many local news papers will post their classified section online.  This is how I found my bike.  In many locations, you can find local shopper magazines with used motorcycles in your area.  These can usually be found in convenience stores or gas stations. <br>  <br>  Get yourself enrolled in a motorcycle safety course.<br>  <br>  Ride Safe - Have Fun|`|PbUdiKEvaa	manufacturers no, but get the tools, cds tubing, welder, a pipe bender  and  do it yourself. but get a lot of practise,|`|XAdUCqblaa	You're really limited to cruisers and choppers.<br>  You could also try a trike.|`|hGaNllmIaa	well u can always get your seat cut

4biGrjPkaa	32,000 - 64,000 and 96,000 I'd recommend. They've got a habit of snapping prematurely. Never let a belt go 8 years, 5 max.<br>  <br>  I'd advise you to change it asap. Better to pay ￡200 now than have the belt snap. They do a lot of damage when they go!<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|t3yZtPVRaa	ring local vauxhall dealer !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|mWZ9BXIdaa	Every 40,000 miles or 4 years, whichever come soonest.
NzIoJlNUaa	You can check to see if your current amp has rca outputs.<br>  If it does then you can hook another amp through these,if not then you can get some rca splitters.<br>  Although a better head unit will give you more control over the amps.<br>  If you buy a better radio try to get one with three rca outs<br>  Front Rear and Subwoofer.<br>  This will allow you to control each amp separately.|`|9ee6572e98b952a4bf68a1e6e6c2b500aa	The way you wire need to do it is by buying a line output converter.  <br>  <br>  If you try to use a splitter on your current RCA output then you will have an issue with either your 6x9s only playing bass or your sub only playing mids and highs.  <br>  <br>  I am assumming that the RCA output on your CD player is switchable from a sub to a rear output.  <br>  <br>  Good Luck!!!|`|DqbOMkSyaa	look at this one <a href="http://automobilesltd.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://automobilesltd.blogspot.com</a>
AA11697737	Rather than going to Yeovilton, you might have more luck at the Royal Naval museum in Portsmouth Dockyard.|`|Mr5cUBBwaa	You should approach the Fleet Air Arm Museum at Yeovilton, Somerset who would have lots of photographs.

WZhPFL5eaa	Go to the public library and consult a copy of the "Consumer Reports" Car issue or refer to the index in the back of the magazine to find the "Crash" test results in the magazine.  It will list current new models and Used models that have the highest crash test ratings.  Some american autos fair well but generally Japanese autos test the best.  Sedan also generally test better than trucks and SUV's.  Why?, because they are considered trucks and the standards for this class are lower than sedans.  Voila.|`|TepR1rACaa	You could look into Subaru they have AWD. Best for snow probably being the Forester. <br>  <br>  Good luck to you.|`|mRRZLiXTaa	Three brands stand out with more than one vehicle making the list--BMW, Subaru and Volvo--each having a slight edge in a specific area. BMW offers a different approach to ride and handling through unique design differences (such as not attaching the anti-roll bars to the struts, therefore providing engineers more freedom in how they tune the vehicle to the road). Volvo, as expected, shows its prowess in additional standard safety elements, such as traction control and auto-off rear fog lights. And Subaru routinely outperforms other cars for its handling under inclement weather conditions,|`|146eddebc93330495f5ebb10453ee48daa	After 21 years of experiencing Michigan winters, the best car that I've drove that is the best in winter is the Ford Escape 4x4. Granted, I know it's an SUV, but they get good fuel economy and they drive great on snow/ice covered roads.<br>  <br>  If you're looking for a car, I would suggest a Subaru Impreza or Outback, or a Ford Fusion with AWD.|`|y6kK96vuaa	The best car I have ever had for winter driving was a Volvo XC90 with Goodyear Fortera Triple Tread tires. They are rated the highest for winter capability. Subaru is also good if you are looking to spend a little less. Good Luck to you.
