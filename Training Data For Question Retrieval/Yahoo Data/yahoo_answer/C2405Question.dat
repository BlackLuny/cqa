I have a friend (girl) to be the babysitter and two people to be the married couple. I also may be able to use the setting of my friend's place who has a baby so that I can have baby stuff around like a crib, etc.      I was thinking of having the reason for the married couple treating this stuffed animal as a child would be that it reminded them of their child they were about to have, but the mother had a miscarriage. the stuffed animal is something the husband bought to give to their child when it was born. maybe after she lost the child somehow, she becomes barren. i need to work on this reasoning a bit more. it would be hard to film their child getting killed somehow since i don't have a child actor to use.       i don't know how to start the film. should i introduce the babysitter on a deaper level? i want it to be mostly about the babysitter and her relationship with the toy. i want her to connect with it somehow, maybe she finds the secret about the parents and becomes sympathetic. im not sure how i will make her connect with the toy. also i don't know how to conclude the film.       any suggestions/ideas/constructive criticism is greatly appreciated!!! thanks.

20090201231946AAD84Ws	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Designing a plot for Short Story / Novel / Video Game?	I've written very short stories before for school assignments and received praise for them - not that I assume that is anything particularly to be proud of.   I would like to make some more stories - I'm interested in writing a final fantasy style video game plot, several short stories for practice and maybe even eventually a novel.        Now, I realize there is no piece of advice that can turn a first time writer into Michael Crichton though I will not deliberately lower my standards.  I just try my best!        I came up with a few ideas.         1. Write the story backwards.   If I decide on plot twists and story line and endings first, then I can build the story up to that point without contradicting myself - and it will help for foreshadowing.      2. Any organizations / corporations / or altered reality will be decided on independently of the story line and in greater detail than will be presented in the book.   Sometimes when I was watching Star Trek I got the distinct feeling they were making up technology to solve made up problems.   I'm concerned that as an amateur writer, if I tried that, it would be blatantly obvious.  But if I limit my universe to be purely background and decide on details BEFORE they are needed then the reader won't be disappointed.      I think it would be easier to write an adventure than a mystery.  Something where the characters are figuring things out - rather than a story in which details are presented and then narrowed down.         Am I right - are some style easier to develop than others?        Are there cliches or specific plots that I should avoid?  (For instance, I think that I, as an amateur writer, would be silly to attempt something of the style where the entire sequence was a dream.  Doesn't mean other people haven't done that well, but I really shouldn't try.)      I'm a little nervous actually.  I'm a huge critic of written material, and screen media - but if I can only turn out 8th grade work, and all my plot points have been done before - maybe the last laugh will be against me.      I'm open to suggestions / comments / insights.   Please!  Help me to make good stories!

I have been looking everywhere for the name or author of this story I read and loved as a child.   From what i can rememberm, it goes like this:      A boy is bored of his life, thinks he works too hard. He watched his old fat cat lay and eat all day, and is extremely jealous of him. One day, he is stroking the cat and finds a zip on the back of its neck. He also finds one on his, and they both step out of their skins and into each others (so they swap bodies really)    then he goes and lives like a cat for a bit, and I can't remember the rest!      If anyone can tell me the name of the story or the author I would be very thankful!

My friend told me today a Twilight spoiler, (and she's a smartass) *SPOILER* that Bella leaves Edward to go with Jacod at the end of Twilight, and that my other friend told me that that didn't happen, but I think she misunderstood by thinking that I ment that Jacob and Bella would be together, but I alreadyknow that Edward and Bella would be together, but I mean in Twilight, if she leaves him.      I want to know if it is false or not, and if it's false, I would be happy (so I hope that some would lie to me or something), but if it's real, then I guess I will have to get to it, but I HATE IT WHEN SOMEONE FREAKIN SPOILS STUFF FOR ME, so can someone tell me how to forget a spoiler???? I don't know what to do, now that she told me, i don't even want to read the book anymore. what do i do???

20090202214931AAzdYFd	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Is this okay? What do you think?	Death By Departure      Every night she prayed her soul to keep.   Every night she cries herself to sleep.   Scared in that bed which she lay.   Fearing the thought of another day.      She lived her life in fear.   Watched him down one more beer.   A firm hand was his belief.   The girl never received relief.      Day by day bruises on her face.   The old man beat her out of place.   Blood shot eyes she always had.   Then one day he drove her mad.      A plan soon came to mind.   She had found a way out of this bind.   Impatiently sitting in the house alone.   Waiting for the old man to come home.      Knowing she had to end this.   The old man she wouldn't miss.   She heard him pull up in the driveway.   This would be the old man's final day.      He walked about drunk, stumbling in.   That night she committed a sin.   In his drink she slipped the pill.   Now he is Forever Still.      His life she had to take.   Never again will he wake.   Never again shall she lay,   fearing the thought of another day.      No longer does she sit in sorrow.   No longer will she dread tomorrow.   He put his own soul up for sell.   That day he was damned to eternal Hell.      ~Becka?

20090202211720AApXkaL	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Help on my story? Can you read this paragraph for me? ?	Marty puffed out an air of laughter from deep in his chest and used one arm to push himself away from the tree. “Whatever,” he said. “Doesn’t matter really, does it?” A bird flew by, cawing loudly, and Marty watched it soar in the air only to disappear into a dark forest covering an endless sea of hills. If Marty listened carefully, he would have heard the bird’s distant caws jerk to a halt, and he would have seen a cluster of trees quiver and shake. Instead, he was captivated by the sight of the setting sun. The thick clouds and low fog caught the yellows and oranges brilliantly, impending rainwater predicted to contain a hint of tanginess, as well as the presence of hard, pelting seeds. But for an unknown reason, Marty could not help the hellish tingles that shot up his spine and raised the hairs over his scalp.            - I'm not sure about using seeds, but I'd like to keep it as some citrus reference.      - The last bit is major foreshadow, but I've never foreshadowed for anything big (he gets bit by a werewolf, so his attention to the sun setting and feeling that it's "hellish," you know?), so can anyone give me tips on foreshadowing, or direct me to places I can look at?      - Also, is the comma necessary after "halt"? (If Marty listened carefully, he would have heard the bird’s distant caws jerk to a halt, and he would have seen a cluster of trees quiver and shake.)      Thanks! :D

20090410114138AA3nfOp	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	What do you think of my short story so far?	I am thinking of entering it into a writing contest when I am done with it. This is only the climax part of the story and only half of it. if it is liked, I will post up more. Where it says ----- that is the person who I am trying to save, but I can't think of the right name.  Any criticism is welcome.      Okay,----, Im guarding the door. You go get her and well be out of here. Hurry. He murmured while glaring at the double doors, expecting someone to burst in at any moment.  I nodded my head as I turned away from him to get ----. The lighting dimmed more and more as I reached the center of the room. My breathing seemed too loud to be mine, but just in case, I slowed it down into calm, jagged air flow.   Two wooden cases with glass covers sat next to each other on a narrow wood table. I stopped and squinted in the dark trying to see inside the long, containers. Something inside one of them seemed to slightly move and my heart rate speed up, pounding blood into my ears and almost making it too loud for me to think.  I knew that had to be ----.   Just as I decided to ask Mark to search for a light switch on the walls near him, a too bright spotlight blazed on above me, letting me see clearly into the cases.  My breath and heart stopped. Someone was aware of what I was doing and that someone wasnt actually trying to stop me from getting ----. It seemed as if that someone was on our team, but I couldnt take the chance. Being conned and cajoled wouldnt help us in the least.  My head snapped towards Mark and I uneasily whispered loud enough for him to hear, Mark! Someone knows that were here! Either that someone is helping us or pushing us into a trap! My breath shook out of control followed by the rest of my body  He turned his head in my direction in a strange manner without letting his blood- shot eyes leave the door. So? What do you want me to do about it? Youve got a job to do no matter what, and if someone is interfering, are you just going to stop what youre doing? I dont think so, so hurry up and lets get out of here. Youre wasting time! He half shouted and half snarled at me.   I stood there, staring at the back of his head, shocked at his resurfacing old attitude. Knowing I didnt have any time to ponder the sudden change, I turned back towards the cases with revived exuberance to slap him silly and curtly responded with sarcasm spilling off every word,  Oh, yeah. I totally forgot I that I am here to save ----s life because of this amazing party that were having while risking our lives! Thanks for reminding me.   I felt his eyes burning holes and seeping venom in my head, but I let it go. There was a job I needed to do, and there was no more time to waste.
