20090202171146AAlScXG	News & Events;Current Events	Troubled world.....food shortage, doomsday seed vault, USA bankrupt, deep underground bases, war?	I have been watching global events and feel that all is not right in the world at this time. In USA, the Deep Underground bases, Fema Prison Camps and the financial crisis. In Norway, the Doomsday Seed Vault, Deep Underground Bases and a politican who has gone public and said that all the governments of the world know that something severe is going to happen in the next few years. Is it all just conspiracy or are we headed for something big. I have always believed in the theory that history repeats.....quite scary.   I would love to hear your thoughts
20090202134051AAv6s0S	News & Events;Media & Journalism	Ideas for an interview/article title?	Hi, so i have to write an article to be submitted to a journalism camp i'd like to go to this summer.      The article must be about an interesting person, and i chose my teacher because she's gone through a LOT in her life time.      Any ideas on what the title should be? I thought of "My Life So Far" but i kind of want to relate it back to the fact she's a teacher. (Ex: Behind The Teacher, Secrets of a Middle School Teacher)      Be creative as possible, thanks! :-D

20090202135906AAEuKz0	News & Events;Current Events	Why has there been very little criticism of Obama's delay in responding to the Kentucky ice storms?	It seems that people were intensely and relentlessly critical of President Bush when there were delays in getting help to Katrina victims.       Here are links to articles describing the issues:       http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/...        http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090202/ap_o...       The day after the storm local municipalities were complaining of  a lack of federal or state emergency relief, Gov. Steve Beshear described the fallout from last week's ice storm as the state's largest-ever natural disaster. ...      But by Monday, there were still a quarter-million people without power, with scores of residents who had first attempted to ride out the storm now giving up and fleeing to shelters.       Today, Feb 2, Gov. Steve Beshear has ask the president to upgrade the federal response by declaring a major disaster, which would open the door for immediate financial assistance.

I thought Obama wanted to build roads and repair our power grid to create millions of jobs      Instead he is putting forward the biggest pork barrel bill in history, most of which does NOTHING to create jobs. Are condom factories going to hire 30,000 more workers b/c of this bill? Are the 100 global warming scientists out there going to get a raise?

Ahmadinejad hasn't spoken about Saddam in a positive light but neither like America or Israel. We'll never know but I'm wondering what peoples opinions are.

He starts by looking to his right, then left, right, left. He is an excellent speaker, but avoids looking to the front. Anybody else notice that? You will now. When I point this out to people they all agree that it makes it uncomfortable to watch him. How can we get this message to his 'coach'?

20090202184501AAn4kfp	News & Events;Current Events	If a Israeli were in a Palestinian hospital, wouldn't they be kicked out?	I hear crazy propaganda about Palestinians not being let into Israeli hospitals.   "Barzilai hospital is about 10 miles from Gaza and serves a large region of southern Israel. Among the hospital's patients are many Palestinians from Gaza -- who we saw in beds alongside Israeli citizens in several of its wards, including pediatrics and labor and delivery. Everyone together sought shelter from these attacks."    http://www.timesdispatch.com/rtd/news/op...       So, wouldn't an Israeli be thrown out of the door in a hospital in the West Bank or Gaza Strip?

There are no objective outlets anymore.  I feel like we live in a communist country and all news is regulated and filtered before we get it.  The news outlets today are extremely crooked.  Not reporting on something is the same as censorship...
