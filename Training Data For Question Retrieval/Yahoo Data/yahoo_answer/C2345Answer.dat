rHlEqiRbaa	yes, because children also spend a lot of time at their home!! so, home envir. do play an imp. role in the learnig.!!!!!!!!!|`|34VXCyvVaa	I'm not sure if this is what you're asking, but I think the neighborhood you live in can make a difference if it has a higher percentage of college-educated people.  People with college degrees understand the importance of a college education, so they are more likely to read to their children, to pay attention to their kids' education, to get involved in the schools, and to make sure their kids are prepared for college.  Their children are more focused on education, which provides a better school environment, and the schools they attend are more likely to be strong schools.|`|QbcnDDxUaa	yaa they do..infact they contribute most of what child has picked up before going to school. like, if a child lives in slums, he is bound to have wrong habits and he is not well mannered.. if child is in rich culture, he will either be spoiled or behave like what others do. a child is like a pile of wet mud.. the more you shape it, the better it becomes. so the neighbours(good people, fighting people,etc) and what parents teach matters the most. rest is shaped up by school. but habits picked from neighbourhood or family go hard.|`|ePSHIgnkaa	Dear, it is house and its surroundings come first in the education. House is where the education starts and parents are the first teachers of any child. A child starts learning, or in fact learns to start his life from his house and people he/she sees around him. OK, as he grows up, a calm and pleasant atmosphere in his house helps a lot for one's concentration during studies.That is why a silent study room is very much essential for every student in his house. Involvement of parents is very much important. After all, education is discribed as the process by which a child becomes a noble man.|`|c78cdb92e7d7cd9ceb1e43a932ae82bcaa	Yes. The percentage of impact remains within what one contribute to house & surrounding.

AA10344737	Simple answer?  Scientists know that there are electrons orbiting the nucleus, but they are not sure where.  Ergo, the electrons are in a "cloud".|`|s9tvr0DTaa	Electron cloud is a term used, if not originally coined, by the Nobel Prize laureate and acclaimed educator Richard Feynman in The Feynman Lectures on Physics (Feynman2006 Vol 1 lect 6 pg 11) for discussing "exactly what is an electron?". This intuitive model provides a simplified way of visualizing an electron as a solution of the Schr?dinger equation, an advancement using the scientific method to surprising observations that could only be explained by introducing randomness. It is also often referred to as an orbital, because the two terms similarly conceptualize the space where an electron is likely to be found but cannot be actually pinpointed. In the electron cloud analogy, the probability density of an electron, or wavefunction, is described as a small cloud moving around the atomic or molecular nucleus, with the opacity of the cloud proportional to the probability density.<br>  <br>  The model evolved from the earlier Bohr model, which likened an electron orbiting an atomic nucleus to a planet orbiting the sun. The electron cloud formulation better describes many observed phenomena, including the double slit experiment, the periodic table and chemical bonding, and atomic interactions with light. Although lacking in certain details, the intuitive model roughly predicts the experime|`|U3qsVeqZaa	Because the electrons are in 'clouds' surrounding the nucleus.

AA10176626	When you say "late", I assume that you mean "after your school's aid deadline".<br>  <br>  The deadline for filing the FAFSA with the Department of Education isn't until June 2010, but it's your school's financial aid deadline that matters, not the Department of Education's.<br>  <br>  If you missed the school deadline, there is a good probability that you will not be considered for a handful of aid programs that you might otherwise have been considered for. Some aid programs involve a limited pool of funds - and your school will allocate those funds to the applicants who submitted their paperwork prior to the deadline. <br>  <br>  However - you will still be considered for the two largest federal student aid programs, the Stafford Loan, and the Pell Grant - and your eligibility will not change, despite having missed the school deadline. It's also likely that some of the students who were offered aid will elect not to attend, so it's not impossible to see some of the already-exhausted aid programs become available right before the beginning of the new school year.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind that the Pell Grant is a form of need-based aid. You will only qualify for that program if your EFC is less than 4041 - a score that identifies you as an "exceptional need" applicant. If your score is above 4041 (like 2/3 of all applicants), the only federal aid program that you will qualify for is the Stafford loan.<br>  <br>  That would have been true even if you did get your application in before the deadline.<br>  <br>  By missing the deadline, the only harm, so far, has been that you probably will not be considered for certain forms of aid that are only available to the neediest applicants. If you ARE one of those, then you've probably cost yourself some possible funding. If you are not an exceptional need applicant, your situation hasn't really changed.<br>  <br>  But get that application in now!<br>  <br>  I hope that helps. Good luck!|`|evEJxv06aa	Yes, you may still be able to get financial aid and good luck.|`|gfOGZtmPaa	Yes, you may still be able to get financial aid. You should contact your school's financial aid office to see what their deadline means to their awards.

All the days that you are absent are noted and written on your report when you finish college (Leaving Certificate and also Junior Certificate!).

Make sure to mention that, although you haven't attended as you probably should, you have gone for and hour and a half twice to find that the class was cancelled once you got there. <br>  <br>  Your professor might even record acknowledgement of your efforts if you go to his office if there is no class. Also email if possible. It's always better to make it clear that you have made efforts two or three ways. Make all efforts possible. <br>  <br>  You just might need a letter of reccommendation late on or after graduation for a job or internship from that same prof. that you have not been showing up for class. Offer and ask for any extra work or office work / internship that you can do. <br>  <br>  You want to be remembered as a responsible and "one of the few" reliable student. Besides thyis is also what you wan to represent for yourself . . . as a reliable person. <br>  <br>  <br>  Always make sure that you are doing the right thing or correcting what your've done even when others aren't doing what they should. Let the slacker be on them, not on you. Even when no one knows about yur good efforts. You know. Go to his office & leave a predone letter under the door if no one is there. But still try & make it to class after calling.  <br>  <br>  Never know when you are gonna need that letter or a good word.|`|pQ3fzgjBaa	He probably won't even know it's you if you call.<br>  So just call and ask him. If you have class then go or you're wasting your money.<br>  I skip a lot of college classes also and still have all A's. But usually I only miss classes that I already know basically everything (english) or classes where the professor rarely even teaches, just rambles incoherently about unrelated topics for an hour (sociology). Other than that I go even if I don't want to.<br>  <br>  I'm not gonna be as hard on you as everyone else, I'm working my way through college also and skip class, I'm not gonna act all self-righteous. But you really should go to class. You learn a lot more when you're actually there being taught in person.|`|cMZEmpp0aa	Today I think you can call someone and ask if class is canceled, but for crying out loud you're in college. Going to school is your JOB, so grow up and start going.<br>  <br>  If you've learned so much more outside the classroom than in it, then leave college and let someone else have your spot. There are thousands of people who would KILL for the opportunity you have. I stand by what I said -- you need to grow up.|`|2646a4e9d6d4e936660d70ff922397f3aa	My original response was, "So whose money are you wasting?", but then I saw that the professor himself had cancelled class three times in two weeks.  I would call, but instead of making it sound like you're hoping class won't meet, say, "I just wanted to make sure that class was meeting today," as if you hoped that it was.|`|AA10526402	I would call but just not say who you are (unless they ask your name)...say something like "Hi, I am a student in your four o'clock calculus class; could you tell me if there will be class today or if it is cancelled due to the weather?"  Hopefully they will just answer without asking which student you are!|`|XOgvpDiZaa	Check your college e-mail. Professors WILL send all of their students e-mails if a class is canceled. It's important to check that everyday.<br>  <br>  If you don't get an e-mail then, class is still on. And go. You will fail.|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	Call the school and check if there will be classes.

BAaf9NKdaa	It does sound as if it would be a reaction of release in theory<br>   and accordingly to your findings, it is such. The warmth of the container shows a slow release within the chemical reaction based<br>   on the controlled amount of iron and copper sulfate and the size<br>   of the container. Using more iron filings in the copper sulfate should show a release of even more energy in the same size container. <br>   This can be verified by the heat of the properties of the container as<br>   it conducts the heat....the container is absorbiing energy while the <br>   experiment of the iron and sulfate shows a release of energy by releasing more heat with the use of more iron filings....this is known as a contradistinctional reaction...the color changes are the reaction of <br>   chemical fusion within the copper sulfate  and iron with the dominant<br>   copper sulfate basically creating the change. Air and water will do<br>   the same to the copper in time if not disturbed creating a bluish coating where the water and air contact. Using vinegar as another source chemical it will when applied cause a chemical reaction that <br>   nutrelizes the blue color and allows the copper to prevail in color...<br>   another chemical reaction of energy. The gases are invisible and toxic<br>   so do be aware of this....
SJ4Nvp9baa	It's not so much that schools want you to learn advanced math but more that math teaches you a systematic, precise way of thinking that is different from the style of thinking used in English or the social sciences or whatever.<br>  <br>  If you've ever noticed, usually when people are good at the math/sciences, they aren't as strong in history/English/liberal arts, and vice versa.  This is due to the notion that generally, people strong in one or the other think predominantly in a certain way.<br>  <br>  Just think of it as expanding your mind.|`|1505a95e660275609c4bb43c388cdf1aaa	Geometry is not an advanced math course.  It's still basic math.  Actually, everything below calculus is a basic math course.  And if you plan to go to college, they'll most likely expect you to know everything through precalculus.  You'd be surprised how many majors require calculus - including business.  And geometry and algebra II will be on the SAT.  Now, if you weren't planning on going to college and getting a job waitressing or something, yes, you won't need even basic math for more than calculating the tip you should have gotten.  But hey, maybe a few years later you'll get sick of working a dead-end job and decide you do want to go to college - and then find out you've got more than a year of remedial coursework in math (that doesn't count for college credit) to make up before you can even get started on the basic college courses.  Save yourself the time now and take geometry.

s9tvr0DTaa	Reconstruction is the era in the U.S. history from 1865 to 1877, when the U.S. focused on abolishing slavery, destroying all traces of the Confederacy, establishing the rights of Freedmen, the name used for freed slaves, and through three new constitutional amendments strengthening the role of the federal governments and its courts. Reconstruction policies were debated in the North as soon as the war started, and began in earnest after the Emancipation Proclamation, issued on January 1, 1863, and the federal occupation of major parts of southern states allowed the formation of new, loyal state governments. President Abraham Lincoln was the major policymaker until his death in April, 1865. Reconstruction began in each state as soon as federal troops controlled most of the state. It ended at different times in different states. The Compromise of 1877 saw the collapse of the last three Republican state governments in the South, so 1877 is the usual date given for the end of Reconstruction, although some historians extend the era to the 1890s.[1] The bitterness and repercussions from the heated conflicts of the era lasted well into the 20th century. "Reconstruction" is also the term used in textbooks for the history of the entire U.S. 1865-1877.

ENbE1Hi2aa	Virtual Charter Schools are FOR profit.  Someone somewhere is getting rich with no accountability to the taxpayer who's paying for it. (K-12 is owned by Michael Milken).  Virtual charters do not have to maintain schools, hire cafeteria workers or maintenance workers, cut the lawn, buy and maintain buses, including drivers, fund sports programs, etc.  They do not have the same student/teacher ratio.  There is no reason for them to receive the same funding as brick-and-mortar schools.  And their funding should definitely be open to public scrutiny. <br>  <br>  I recommend reading this study from Arizona State University:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://epsl.asu.edu/epru/documents/EPSL-0404-118-EPRU.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://epsl.asu.edu/epru/documents/EPSL-...</a>|`|6fVzzNhiaa	The school choice promotion because of NCLB does give the impression that whatever kind of schooling a family wants is the kind that will be offered, doesn't it.  The choice that is meant (from the wording at the NCLB site) isn't to be from among a smorgasbord of choices.  When school choice is part of the equation of where a child will attend school, it is dependent on the poor performance of the school the child is in, and limits are in place as to who is eligible.<br>  <br>  Another problem with public services is that during a budget crunch, something has to be cut somewhere and variety takes a hit as long as basic services are still provided.  This happened two years ago with a non-DoD overseas distance-learning school program for military families in the Pacific, except that the entire program was eliminated.  The children, though, still had local DoD schools available to them.<br>  <br>  Apparently in Ohio, the virtual schools were receiving over $5,000 per child per year, and that was without the need to provide a building, desks, chalkboards, playgrounds, playground equipment, or cafeterias, even though the e-school provider administrator says that they "can't imagine how the school could sustain that level of performance on [the decreased] level of funding."<br>  <br>  For purposes of comparison, the 2006 level of per-pupil funding in Ohio was $9,598 with 78% going to employee compensation.  It is obvious that the people part of the equation is far above the $1,500 planned for virtual compensation, but if brick and mortar costs are rising while the economy slows (which probably means a reduced amount of taxes received), which of the schools should have preferential funding?<br>  <br>  I'm guessing that the intent of the NCLB wording was to provide choice within the main public school system, and then only in certain cases.  The whole "choice" structure seems to have taken on a life of its own that goes beyond the wording of the law.|`|zssd4K6vaa	If you take a look at both Ohio Community school funding and brick and mortar funding, you will see how much each school receives.I have placed both links below.<br>  <br>  The article you referenced points out that community schools do not have facility costs.  Because of that, they need a new funding formula to reflect the difference between their actual costs and the actual costs of brick and mortar schools.  Why shouldn't the  schools  be able to stay open if they tighten their belts as everyone in the state is having to do?<br>  <br>  If you read all the education news about the budget, the e-schools are not the only ones concerned about funding losses. There seem to be cuts all across the board.  There just isn't much money to be found anywhere these days.
8s2Bybysaa	I took Health and social care becasue i want to be a doctor and go into medicine. Let me just tell you that whatever you pick, doesnt really matter at this level as i have found out. What really matters is that whatever you pick, you must get good grades in it. To go into medicine i would say pick subjects that look good, for example 'History', 'Geography', 'ICT' etc. I think that health and social care is a good foundation for going into medicine but it is not essential that you pick it. Hope this answers your question!|`|IHw2qUtcaa	Physics, biology, human biology and chemisty.. health and social care is more to do with older people. ``|`|a9255673c3ed5cb76b3cc823c2f5a42faa	i am in the same situation.<br>  apparently, its ok for that kind of thing but wouldn't you need science as well?<br>  i will take health and social care as it has elements of sociology in it and its meant to be good.. otherwise...<br>  <br>  why don't you do a google search on it?<br>  it might help to find out background information about what it involves.

There are no subjects you need to have studied beforehand to do Archaeology but an interest in history, sociology and the sciences will obviously help.<br>  <br>  I would reccomend looking at Cardiff University, I'm currently studying Archaeology there and thinks its a really good uni for the subject, it offers BA or BSc Archaeology degrees, many unis only offer BAs.
FQeSo65Haa	Critical thinking means to interpret things out of nowhere, or to overthink. Contrary to popular opinion, it does NOT mean "thinking deeper".<br>  <br>  An example of critical thinking follows.<br>  Scenario: A man is walking down the empty street with his dog.<br>  Interpretation: The empty street symbolizes that every man walks the road of his life alone. He is walking, neither hurrying or running. By neither hurrying or running, the author shows that the man has no hurry in life, but is slowly and calmly taking life one step at a time. The fact that he has his dog with him may be interpreted as the old saying "A dog is a man's best friend", alluding to the treachery of man against his fellow creatures, his intelligence having led him to egomaniacal arrogance. A dog has no such "superior" intelligence, and gives love in exchange for love. However, the dog is also on a collar, attached to a leash which the solitary man is holding. This may symbolize that, even though dogs may be a man's best friend, the man  or man in general can never trust anyone, is rather insecure at heart, and must always have a collar and a leash on his surrounding environment, which may include loved ones. Altogether, the whole scene  symbolizes the loneliness of mankind brought on by our own inability to accept things as they are and let go of our tendency to want control.<br>  <br>  See how I mad a whole "critical thinking" paragraph out of a simple guy walking his dog..|`|RPpXarDDaa	read...re-read..take notes...analyze

AA10023710	Your drawings can, and should, form the core of your portfolio. Use other work to supplement those drawings, but don't be afraid of putting the drawings front and center. <br>  <br>  I assume your drawings are done from life, and not from photos. If they are done from photos, it's important that you focus on doing drawings from life now - still lifes, landscapes, portraits, figures, hands, feet, arms, cats... whatever, but *from life*. <br>  <br>  Likewise, if you normally draw from your imagination, that's great, but you also need to include some drawings from life. They want to see if you can represent what you see. <br>  <br>  As for that "wide variety of work" that the tutor spoke of - don't try to incorporate a million new things at this late date. Be more focused. Try to incorporate two or three new things, so you broaden your portfolio. And it may be easiest to keep those new things somewhat tied in to the pencil work you already do. <br>  <br>  If you like to draw in pencil, you may want to try drawing in other media, such as pastel or ink. If your work is normally black and white, you may want to introduce color to your work via colored pencils or watercolors. And as another poster said, you probably should try some paintings. As I mentioned, watercolors go very well with pencils, and that may be something worth trying. It builds on your strengths, rather than introducing something entirely foreign to you. <br>  <br>  No need to go all abstract if your work is normally realistic, but maybe if you normally only do pencil drawings of still life/objects, you add in a portrait, or a landscape. Likewise, if your work is normally 2-D pencil drawings, you try something 3-D, like sculpture. That'd be a real departure, though, so don't stress if it doesn't turn out. Try that *in addition* to the other 2-D work I suggested. <br>  <br>  These are some ideas you can use. Pick the ones you feel would work the best for you now, and try them. Give yourself a bit of time to experiment with each technique - don't try to make the first landscape drawing you do be your portfolio piece. Maybe it is, or maybe it isn't. Maybe the first one sucks, and the next one is better, and the third one is the one you include. Start now, so you have plenty of time to play with the new materials. <br>  <br>  And don't worry if your paintings aren't as strong as your drawings. You've been drawing for forever, and painting is pretty new to you. That's okay. It's fine to have your drawings be your strongest pieces. Those, again, can still be the focus of your portfolio - those are your depth; the new things will add breadth.|`|Gburbcuiaa	I do a lot of pencil too and I recently took painting. You might want to try painting, if you can draw already, painting is easier than it looks. I really don't like to paint because it takes too long to clean up and set up. You probably should only have one or two pieces of realistic art. Art schools today want to see more "stylistic" art. Maybe you could "assign" yourself a few projects in different styles and mediums over the next few weeks. The internet is full of tutorials and ideas.|`|uDNSuPJnaa	Hey. I think first of all, they need to see you are an all round designer/artist. The ability to be able to draw is a good starting point, and even in there they might look for the various principles of drawing, like line weight, contrast, light play and proportions, and so on... things that make for dramatic art or things that are appealing. And then you could also show scale, like do a few postage stamp designs for any country you like, with any theme you like. Maybe even a self portrait on a postage stamp! You need to surprise them. As far as design  is concerned I showed them everything from type studies, to book jackets, to logo design to editorial design etc. So show as many mediums as you can in as many different styles as possible.

Either stay at home with your parents, if there okay with you still living with them and go to school full time and work part time or full time, whichever you think you can handle, that way you can save up your money to move out and pay for college. You could either get loans to pay for the tuition or try to get scholarships or money some other way. There are a few schools that are work schools and will allow you to go to school for almost free by working for the school. Check them out, you might want to go to one of them.

The counselors office at you school has this info too. Sometimes they even have the writinf contests and scholarship forms right there. Ask questions. No just thing as a dumb question. Just ask<br>  <br>  That is so GREAT that you wanna go. However $$ should not be that reason to stop you. Most people who have attended college could not afford it nor their parents. <br>  <br>  There are lots of scholarship programs that companies have to offer, churches and even the school itself. Write a "personal Resume" which is just a letter to Dear Executive Officer,<br>  <br>  it tells all about yourself and the things that you like to do. Activites and groups that you are involved in. <br>  Church Choir,  . . . .

But I most enjoy _____ ______ and ___ ___.  <br>  <br>  I am writing because I am very interested in attenting college and  would like to be considered for a scholarship in your program.<br>  <br>  Lot's (almost all) of the scholarship programs want you to write an essay about a topic that they give you or a few to pick your oppinion on. Not bad at all to get $5,000 or even more just for writing an essay. Some of these companies are Target, Walgreens, Colgate, and maybe even Google. These are companies that your are seeking college $$$ from, not to work there or even if you've ever been there. There are thousands. So let's see how many you can fill out and different topics you can write your oppinion about. <br>  <br>  Also, if you are still in Highschool, take the ACT at least 4 times. Your best score will be taken from them all. <br>  <br>  Call or contact the schools that you are thinking about and ask for the SEOG grant. It might be called something else by now, but each school gets grant money only for those who ASK, untill the $$ is gone for that semester. So make sure to apply early and ask often & FASFA too (apply the first week they are taking applications/early). <br>  <br>  There are other scholarships that are just for what you are interested in. Like Photography in Maine, or Women Engineers, or the pilots program for new and interested pilots, or whatever your hobbie, interest, are. . . <br>  <br>  After you've done your personal resume . .go to Fast Web.com it is a great start.     <br>  <br>  The counselors office at you school has this info too.

42681f307fb408bdb139fccfbb2b2417aa	I think it starts off sort of dry so I suggest you add some question at the beginning of your essay or some sort of illustrative example such as: Have you ever felt your imagination been piqued to such heights that you thought you must be the most creative person in the world, or at least in your own town? Well, every day when I pick up my favorite book to read or even watch a movie on television, I find myself re-enacting the role that I find most interesting. Acting has always been my deepest passion.........AND <br>  and so you take it from there.<br>  <br>  I also suggest you add more SAT words. Get yourself an up to date thesaurus and dictionary and throw or replace some words around. It is a great essay overall, and it is a good place to start but you need to sauce it up a bit. Add an exclamation mark to one of your sentences to make it seem exciting. Also I think you need a more catchy clincher sentence at the end of the essay (or you could even end it w/ a question mark as well.)<br>  <br>  Good job...just don't send it in yet.<br>  Hoped you like my intro but then again it is only an example so this should spark your jist.|`|NtSQcyHLaa	Overall, it's a very good application essay. There are a couple grammatical problems. "Over" in the second sentence where I think you meant "older." You need a period at the end of the sentence that starts "And of course I remember..." The only other thing that I can think of is that you might want to add some more evidence that will support your decision to go to the school, like their credentials that convinced you to go. You don't want to be overly flattering, but you want them to know that you did your research and you're positive that they are the school for you and you're the kind of student that they want. Also, maybe make the background information a little more concise, with most of the emphasis on your own acting credentials. They're more interested in what you've done and what you can do, and less about your history. You'll have the chance to tell that story when you make it big and write an autobiography. Haha. Good Luck, though!

So that would leave you with 8 kids with nothing to do. Well, you could have three kids play the houses and they could be blown over by the wolf's breath. And there's the obvious tree/rock (basically dress the other kids as scenery). That would be good for kids who are particularly shy on stage. Maybe still give them lines like "The wolf's coming, get in side little pigs!" or something like that. You could even double up the kids to play the houses, so 6 kids could do that job with 2 kids each for each house. Single-color clothes options and face paint could make fore easy costumes for the scenery and houses, and novelty noses form any costume store would suffice for the pigs and the wolf.

YkseyT7zaa	It's tough. My daughter didn't like it either because of the noise and being in a bus seat. It takes some time to desensitize them. Keep trying. good luck|`|HCvJ0AGnaa	My eight year old (sever autism) when three hated buses with a passion. He'd be screaming half way up the road before he even saw the bus, but at the time I had NO option but to get the bus. Ours was also a little hopper stopper and on two occasions we were asked to get off, due to the noise and complaints of others. Damn rude but I can't really blame them, the screams were ear piercing!!<br>  <br>  He loved at the time Brum the car, so i found a annual and a CD with the music on..I started using this with him at home to start with, getting him used to the head phones. He'd wear the ones that slot into the ear but not the ones that cover the ear. When he was really into the routine of having them on and looking at the annual, I secretly took them with me on the bus. He started screaming again when we were walking up the road, so I showed him the CD player and said 'On bus'......he stopped thought for a sec lol and then screamed again. When we got to the bus I said 'Tom cry, no music'...he mumbled a bit but got on without any hassle. He sat for the 20 mins journey listening to it in silence. Well until the singing started lol, but that got a far better reception that the screams lol!!<br>  <br>  For my son it was the noise and hollowness of the bus that he hated, that and the other people chatting, it was just too much for his senses.<br>  <br>  I really hope this works for you, it's so distressing and embarrassing to be in this situation, but many of us have been there and it does pass.

I have no argument with the essential part they play in the reproduction of the species. However, the reproductive process have been assured by the pleasure both parties receive when they engage in it. I contend that love is love and sex is sex. When combined, they work well together. If both people are about the same mind. They are really two descrete needs and should be treated as such. Time and space will permit me to expound furthur, especially in the area of psyche.

AA10176626	Gabriel:<br>  <br>  The closest thing to a student loan modification is a loan consolidation. A loan consolidation is really a new loan that pays off all of your old loans. The consolidation loan will have its own new terms and conditions.<br>  <br>  One of the chief selling points of a consolidation loan is that you can choose a new loan with a longer repayment term. A longer repayment term will cut your monthly payment obligation - perhaps considerably, depending on the length of the new loan.<br>  <br>  Keep one very important thing in mind. When you extend a repayment process, you generate a large amount of interest. You will be given longer to repay the loan - your monthly payments will decrease - but you will wind up paying a LOT more to the lender than you would have under the original loan. Make sure you understand exactly what the long-term financial ramifications of any consolidation loan will be. Don't just get caught up in the "Wow!" factor of "look how much I can save every month!"<br>  <br>  Right now, finding a lender to consolidate your existing loans will be somewhat challenging. If any of your loans are federal student loans, your luck will be considerably better. Here's some information, from the US Department of Education on their own consolidation program: <a href="http://www.ed.gov/offices/OSFAP/DCS/consolidation.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ed.gov/offices/OSFAP/DCS/cons...</a> and <a href="http://www.loanconsolidation.ed.gov/" rel="nofollow">http://www.loanconsolidation.ed.gov/</a><br>  <br>  Private loans and federal loans can not be consolidated together - you would need separate loans. <br>  <br>  Several lenders are still making consolidation loans for education - other lenders are not. If you are interested in consolidating non-government loans, I would recommend that you use <a href="http://www.bankrate.com/brm/rate/college_home.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.bankrate.com/brm/rate/college...</a> for an up-to-date list of lenders who are still making consolidation loans to borrowers in your area.<br>  <br>  Good luck - I hope this information helped.

I studied on my own with library books for 2 weeks and pass the test at a 99.2 percentile ranking, i was in 11th grade at the time. concerning jobs and college, ive never seen a job application ask specifically whether or not i had a GED, the question was always phrased "DO you have a High school diploma or GED" The GED is as good as a diploma, as far as ive seen. regarding college, all the colleges (2 year colleges) I have seen don't care. Chico State doesn't care, but if you make it through junior college you will most likely get accepted to any 4 year if your grades are right. High school is not for all people, If you feel you don't belong or whatever, take your GED, at least do that. With that, get a job.. I have a GED and some college courses and have held employment with Electronic Manufacturers as a Test Technician, its all up to your conviction.

Ergonomics is designed to reduce any additional pain or posture related injuries brought about by poor or sustained postures and repetitive movements. The approach is to help enable the individual to engage in activities more comfortably over long periods creating an increase in productivity without the fear that any wrong movement may cause an injury. All this is influenced by the efforts taken by the organization and design of the persons work as well as factors such as seating, work heights and work environment. The diagram below illustrates the organization's influence on ergonomics and well-being in the work-place.

Can you get statements from at least one professional who can attest to your situation--- guidance counselor, clergy person, social worker, etc....  In order to perform a dependency override, the financial aid office is required to collect sufficient documentation to prove that you are indeed independent.

You must have someone who knows what happened between you and your parents.  Do you  have any sort of documentation to prove that your parents have abused or neglected you? Police reports, letters from  guidance counsellors, foster families, teachers, church leaders, the court who intervened in the matter....  Any of these would be helpful.

Plenty of people completely re-invent themselves when they go to university. I didn't make an active effort to do so as such, but just by hanging around with a different group of people to those who I had been studying with for the previous eight years meant that the 'university me' was a very different person to the 'school me'.

mm7ABdlXaa	LOL - Good question.  I think there are several possibilities.  One - they probably did love teens to begin with and just got burned out.  Two - maybe they are teaching a grade-level they don't like because it was all that was available to them.  Three - they are ready to be done teaching, but don't foresee how to make a living in any area other than teaching.<br>  The entire concept of your question is why I disagree with tenure.  I don't think that teachers should be able to keep their job simply because they have tenure.  I hope that if there ever comes a day where I don't like my job, when I'm not an engaging teacher - that someone tells me flat out - "Um, excuse me, but you suck and you need to get a job doing something else."  lol<br>  To the teachers credit - maybe he/she doesn't hate teenagers... it's a tougher job than many will believe... but I totally see your point.

The standard of your writing here makes it instantly apparent that you are a very poor student.<br>  <br>  Teachers want to have success, they want to see their students go into the world and achieve - do great things. You can't blame them for losing interest in those who won't make the attempt to learn, those who they can see will be a drain on society rather than contribute to it.|`|82a4bd999404bced3be0ccff2c393a40aa	I'm sure the teachers wouldn't hate you if you spelled properly and used punctuation.<br>  <br>  Seriously, though, most teachers don't hate their students. It's just that teenagers (a) think they're God's gifts to the world and act like jerks all the time, (b) are always doing stupid things for the sake of impressing their "friends" or the people they want to be their friends, (c) think that the world revolves around them and when someone (say, a teacher) lets them know otherwise, they get annoyed, indignant, and enraged.

Teachers don't hate students, and if they were Professors, only giving the information not having to teach it, it would be eaiser. But, alas, you don't learn, and they get blamed. The stress comes to them from above. If it weren't for principals (all of which are failed teachers) teachers would be much more successful. But, the Principals are all stressed out by Superintendents, and them by the people who failed out of high school and are sitting on the school boards where professional educators aren't allowed to serve.

2aa6a351069e388eff62776571ad1ec7aa	You need to have a firm sick policy. If a child has a fever, diarrhea, or has vomited in the last 24 hours, they should not come back to day care. Other than that, you could ASK parents to keep children home when there's a serious illness spreading in their family and explain just what you've told us, but they might not be willing to do it. <br>  <br>  The best way to prevent it from spreading is to clean, clean, clean. Not just when children are sick, but always. Don't allow children to share toys if they've been near their mouths. Wash hands more frequently. Use a bleach solution to clean hard surfaces and hard toys. Use Lysol to clean soft surfaces. Watch to make sure kids are not sharing cups or mouthed toys. They say that a surprising number of germs live on doorknobs, so clean those well. <br>  <br>  In spite of all your best efforts, it's likely that children will spread illness sometimes, anyway. It just seems to be a fact of life.<br>  <br>  Added after what you added:<br>  If you are doing all the cleaning you can, then that's the best you can do. If children are obviously ill, you have every right to not allow them in your day care, but you have to have that stated clearly in your policies. You can also talk to parents and ask that they ALL stay away, explaining how the stomach illness seems to spread so rapidly (may save them time off work later), but I doubt they'll be that cooperative. Parents might also choose to find a day care that's more lenient where illness is concerned, and not care about getting sick.|`|BY02DhfWaa	the parents should have the kid kept in and away from Other people they should know this . i also understand that they need to work you just need to decide if the other kids are more important or if that one child is worth making everyone else sick .|`|i5tOQGgFaa	We are in a hard position here, aren't we?  I know all about clean clean cleaning :-)  I do the same but because of the multiage group the children still get sick because we have a few droolers a few who wipe noses with hands instead of tissue, forgetting to catch coughs, etc and there are siblings in our care instead of being in seperate classrooms...so no matter how hard I clean and teach...all that is really developmental and so we just have to go with the flow...and to be truthful... the families aren't usually "neat freaks" at home and so their toys never get cleaned and children aren't always expected to wash their hands, etc...all we can do is our part in the cleaning (being sure the bleach is fresh every day makes a big difference) and teaching and sticking to our sick policy.  Unfortunately, unless the child has the symptoms already, we can't rightly ask for them to stay at home...and that often backfires on us because they are contagious BEFORE they show the symptoms.  You can suggest that if it's possible to keep the child at home so that you can help stop the spread...but can you really follow through on that?  Do you have that flexible of parents?  Good luck in trying to decide what to do!|`|c55O7jqXaa	This is just something that happens in all daycare no matter how clean you are. <br>  <br>  Be firm on the sick policy- no fever, vommiting, dirrahea for 24 hours.<br>  <br>  Get out the Lysol and spray in between<br>  <br>  Keep toys cleaned with a cap full of bleach in really hot water and machine wash the rest in hot water. Spray down items with Lysol that can't be washed. <br>  <br>  Try to do a spot check at the door and call parents if child is sick. Have an area where the sick kids can go to wait for parents to come back and pick up. <br>  <br>  If you are gonna get sick you are gonna get sick. There is no preventing it, but you sure can cut it down. <br>  <br>  Children are in close quarters, they touch each other, touch hands, etc. Open up windows and let some fresh air in and get that air circulating.

It is an intense program where you are trained in differential diagnosis and treatment of the orthopedic, neurologogic, integument, and cardiopulmonary systems.  We are generally the experts in musculoskeletal treatment.  The programs stress evidence based medicine.  A dissertation is required.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.apta.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Career_as_PT_PTA&Template=/TaggedPage/TaggedPageDisplay.cfm&TPLID=242&ContentID=31095" rel="nofollow">http://www.apta.org/AM/Template.cfm?Sect...</a>|`|5843355184faeff731f1a94bbecb55e4aa	Most programs are seven years in length (provided you finish your BS in four).

zZxX5PXBaa	In ordinary usage, a plethora really is just a lot. You can't be precise, or give a set number and say, more than that number is plethora, less isn't.<br>  <br>  There's one important difference between a lot and a plethora. You can have a lot of things. A lot of penguins, a lot of answers, a lot of starships. They're all specific things ... not necessarily physical, but discrete entities. The same way, you can have a plethora of these things, penguins, answers, starships; plethora and lot interchangeable. (and instead of a lot of penguins you could have loads of penguins, or tons of penguins, or gazillionsof penguins ... except ... think of all the fish you'd have to feed them, and mess to clean up).<br>  <br>  But you can also have a lot of love to give. Or feel a lot of sadness. So there is some general quality or 'stuff' that comes in larger or small quantities. Lot is fine for that, but plethora isn't. Loads of love is fine too, or tons of love, but not gazillions. Nobody can give gazillions of love. Not even a single gazillion. Not even a person with a gazilliion penguins.|`|TIVrZ2I8aa	I haven't heard that word in years.  It is so funny to say and hear!<br>  <br>  Plethora is a noun.

AQBow7Glaa	Go to the Web site of the college you're interested in applying to and check the "employment" "jobs" or "Human Resources" section.  Look in the faculty section for ads for "part-time" or "adjunct" faculty.<br>  <br>  You'll also need a Curriculum Vitae; that's the academic version of a resume.  Send that plus whatever other materials the ads ask for.  Hiring is cyclical, so you may not hear back until they're ready to hire teachers for Fall (summer is usually  hard to get a teaching spot).<br>  <br>  You might also check the continuing education subsites of your local community college Web sites.  Continuing Ed is often a separate division with separate hiring.|`|6f5395773cce7a0187fdf217ce48b5e9aa	It depends on the subject area and whether you are looking for tenure track professorship or just being a lecturer.  Tenure track professorships are highly competitive so just meeting the minimum standards may not get you very far.  In this case the minimum academic degree is a masters in the subject or masters in anything, plus 18 graduate level credits in the subject.  Doctoral level education is highly recommended to set you apart, particularly with respect to college level teaching experience.  Vocational tracks tend to require only a bachelors, but you must supplement with extensive real world experience in the subject, certifications, and such.<br>  <br>  Meanwhile, lecturer positions are less competitive but the position is not that great since there is no guarantee of steady work, low pay, and no benefits.   And even though I say it is less competitive, that is relatively speaking.  In the humanities, social sciences, there may still be so many candidates in the lecturer pool that you wont get selected unless you got some serious credentials beyond the minimums.|`|AA10023710	At a minimum, you need a masters degree in the field you plan to teach. Depending on the field, you may also need related work experience. <br>  <br>  There are exceptions. For some cc jobs, you do need a PhD.

uoknng0Maa	I think that year round schooling is good, and to be precise, the best. I think it is good because it gives you flexibility in your schedule and life as a whole, it doesn't keep you under pressure, you don't get to miss school even if something comes up in your schedule or life, and it makes you take control of your schedule and your life as a whole, so you decide what to do and when to do it.|`|8740c9d03300d2d76f91ceaf7a9ffc93aa	Good because time goes so fast!|`|aac7c6d4d79683e9cae0fe6a541bbccdaa	As a homeschooler, I like year round schooling.  We take a summer break, but we continue to do educational and enriching activities during that break and actually, a lot of other "school" stuff as well-our schedule is just a little lighter.  <br>  <br>  I want my children to recognize learning as a constant part of life, not something that is done in a brick building called "school" betwen the hours of 8 and 3, Monday-Friday for nine months out of the year when they are between the ages of 5 and 17.  <br>  <br>  I do not think that year round schooling is logical for a public school system.  Private, perhaps, but not public.  Those children are so stressed they need that break, even though research indicates that the first couple of months of a new school year is spent relearning information that was not retained over the summer from the previous school year.  While a year round program would be best for them academically, you would have all of these highly stressed children and it would not work well.<br>  <br>  There are also the issues it would have as far as planning vacations, for child care for those that do not stay home, etc. as with  year round schooling, children are on different schedules.|`|BXALhzvtaa	Year round education is good.

6f5395773cce7a0187fdf217ce48b5e9aa	You need an accounting degree or equivalent at minimum.  Since you have a bachelors degree already you can just go back and take the accounting courses itself.  You will need at least 18-24 upper division hours in accounting (including an auditing course), in addition to any lower division intro accounting courses (normally 2 classes).  Some business colleges offer an accelerated undergrad accounting curriculum as a postgraduate certificate course.  This means you can finish all the courses in shorter time such as 2 semesters. <br>  <br>  When you have done that it is recommended you take the CPA exam as you will find much more opportunities once you have earned that title.  But just having the accounting coursework completed will get you a base level auditing job so you can earn income and gain experience right away.

After a long expansion, America's economy looks weak (though unevenly so). Fragile credit markets, a deepening housing bust and soaring oil prices have created a real risk that Americans will slow their spending sharply, dragging the economy down.<br>  <br>  The most important indicator of America's economic prospects over the next few years is house prices. By borrowing against capital gains on their homes, households have been able to consume more than they earn.

a1b7363978e397f1d4527a8de30ab150aa	I love it when somebody asks this question because it allows me to explain ( a little bit) how the university system works.  So many students have the false impression that they must have their major chosen prior to entering into the university, but this is just simply not true.  Yes, it usually helps if you have a major or majors in mind, but even when a student does, oftentimes he/she will change his/her mind.  The average college student switches majors 3 times while in undergraduate schooling! <br>  <br>  So, what can you do?  You can go in with an undeclared major, take some classes in theater; some in music, some in art/fashion, and slowly figure out what your "calling" is. You do not have to declare your major(s) until the second semester of sophomore year or first semester of junior year, and by then you should have a very good idea of which major(s) is/are best for you.  Good Luck!

adwkFYYraa	Well your teacher should have told you how long to make it, but usually essay quetions should be like a 2-4 paragraphs long, or 300-400 words. Hope this helps!!!|`|u7UnUZXnaa	5 to 6 sentences.|`|AA12318686	Hi Jhon!<br>   Obviously, the essay should be long enough to answer the question or to effectively support your position on the subject. There are a few different types of essays, too. See Essay in Wikipedia, below the box with the Contents. Scroll down to the entry, 5 paragraph essay. <br>  <br>  You need to know what type of essay has been assigned to you. <br>  Your essay should answer the 5 W questions, Who, What, Where, When and Why and How. At the end of the essay, you can write the question, " and why not?" That always worked for me. You have to engage the reader from the first sententence.. until the very last word!<br>  <br>  When you get the assignment, think about it, and write your essay that day or evening, answering the question, as best as you can, then go to your teacher the next day, ask them to look at it and get some feedback about what you have written and how to improve your essay. Then, go and revise it according to what the teacher tells you. Tell them thank you. Check with your teacher again after you followed their advice, to see where your essay can still be improved. Don't forget the thank you. Re write your essay and submit it on time. <br>  <br>  Learning to write a great essay will really help you after you graduate and have to apply to a college or university or for a job application or to write about a complaint, or an idea that you might have to express. Do not underestimate the power of well written words and clearly expressed ideas. It could make you stand out from the crowd and get you something that you really would like ! <br>  <br>  Good luck, Jhon !|`|AA11203798	essay questions are best answered succinctly ,that is concisely and accurately utilising relevant references where possible.|`|YTIDE8Evaa	300 words.

ewIELhBiaa	Well better program is always the best route to go. I would take the friends out of the mix all together especially if your going pre-med of course friends are important but your school is more important and you can keep in touch with them on breaks and make new friends. But 4000 is a big number and a good savings so if your financially unable to go to the other school the savings makes this school the best choice with the bonus of people you already know. You have a long road of education ahead of you please choose wisely and choose what you know you can stick with.
fgnQ2vLqaa	Yes, the sentence is correct. Sometimes writers leave out "and" to change up the sentence structure. Also, if "and" isn't used, it might convey that the list isn't complete. The reader could infer that more activities were shared rather than just those four mentioned. If "and" were used, you might assume those were the only things done together.

AA12067891	I don't know anything about endangered animals, but i have taken a couple of speech and public speaking classes and i have to help my little sister write her speeches for speech class like every other week.<br>   So I know that you should have a interesting intro. The first part of your speech is the most important. It should be great and make people want to listen not dull and bore people. Maybe a startling fact about endangered animals, like "In the years 1990 the were over 500 panda bears living around the world. Today, there are only 5..." (That's not true, lol) Or an quote from some animal right person. Or ask a rhetorical question that makes people think. <br>  <br>  Then you need to say something about why this affects your audience, which is most likely your classmates. And why they need to listen. <br>  <br>  The next part is the body of the speech. This should be the longest. You can break it up in three separate main point you want the audience to know. The first point could be some info on the panda. "Pandas have a white coat with black fur around their eyes. Pandas live mainly on the ground..." <br>  <br>  Alright. The next main point can be about why they are endangered. And what a negative affect it can have on the environment. <br>  <br>  The last main point can be about what you can do to protect these animals. Like donate money and whatnot. You could mention a couple of organizations like WWF (the link is below) and tell about what they are doing to help.<br>  <br>  The last part of your speech is your conclusion. You basically need to summarize everything you just said. <br>  Good Luck!!|`|y9TUWrjIaa	Try to think out of the box on this one.<br>  1. What impact do these endangered species have on our environment ?<br>  2. In the food chain<br>      a. how will the loss of these animals affect the flora and fauna ?<br>  <br>  Try to look at the big picture hon, once you start thinking of the loss of just one species, I think the thoughts will start to flow. Then condense it down to your allotted 3 minutes. Good luck, I'm sure you'll do fine.|`|bYUdtQZsaa	First, look up animals. Find one that you feel passionate or strongly about. For example, my sister loves frogs. So finding one that is endangered would be important to her because its her favorite animal and it sucks that it is dying out. Once you find one, see where they are from, why they are going instinct, and what people can do to help, and what people are already doing to help. Also, look up some tips on speech giving. Find little things that may add to your time. Like asking rhetorical questions. Then time it and try it out. Also, try not to repeat yourself a lot. And if you do, say it completely different. And add a bunch of adjectives. GOOD LUCK!

a01a4c7fa42d359ddf53eaa686c7f84faa	First establish that (1, 6) is a solution to the equation of the circle.  This can be easily done by plugging x = 1 and y = 6 into the equation.  Also, find the slope of the given line.  In slope-intercept form, the equation of a line is this:<br>  <br>  y = mx + b.<br>  <br>  Your equation in the slope-intercept form is y = -x + 7, where m = -1.  Therefore, the slope of the line is -1, and the slope of the tangent line to the circle at the point (1, 6) must also be -1. <br>  <br>  Differentiate the equation of the circle implicitly:<br>  <br>  2x + 2yy' - 4 - 14y' = 0<br>  <br>  Now isolate y'.  y' is the slope, equivalent to m, of the tangent line at any given point (x, y) which lies on the circle:<br>  <br>  2yy' - 14y' = 4 - 2x<br>  y' (2y - 14) = 4 - 2x<br>  y' = (4 - 2x)/(2y - 14)<br>  y' = 2 (2 - x)/2 (y - 7)<br>  y' = (2 - x)/(y - 7)<br>  <br>  Now plug x = 1 and y = 6 into the equation above:<br>  <br>  y' = (2 - x)/(y - 7)<br>  y' = (2 - 1)/(6 - 7)<br>  y' = 1/-1<br>  y' = -1<br>  <br>  Since (1, 6) lies on the circle, and it is also a solution to the equation x + y = 7, and the slope of the tangent line to the circle at that point is -1, then the line y + x = 7 is a tangent to the circle at the given point.|`|AA10439008	Find the derivative (slope) of the circle at any point (x,y).  It is<br>  dy/dx = (2 - x) / (y - 7) by implicit differentiation.<br>  The line solved for y is y = -1x + 7 and so has slope -1<br>  Replace y with (-1x + 7) in dy/dx and you get<br>  <br>  (2 - x) / -1x which = -1 if x = 1, making y = 6 so at (1,6) the line and circle have the same slope and are tangent<br>  <br>  Hope that makes sense|`|EkhEvfXFaa	You have to show that the given line touches the given circle at one point only<br>  <br>  x^2 + y^2 - 4x - 14y + 51 = 0<br>  <br>  (x^2 - 4x + 4) + (y^2 - 14y + 49) = -51 + 4 + 49 [completing the square on x and y]<br>  <br>  (x - 2)^2 + (y - 7)^2 = 2  [eqn 1]<br>  <br>  y + x = 7<br>  <br>  y = 7 - x [eqn 2]<br>  <br>  Subs [eqn 2] into [eqn 1] → (x - 2)^2 + (7 - x - 7)^2 = 2<br>  <br>  x^2 - 4x + 4 + x^2 = 2<br>  <br>  2x^2 - 4x + 2 = 0<br>  <br>  (2x - 2)(x - 1) = 0<br>  <br>  2x - 2 = 0 or x - 1=0<br>  <br>  x = 1 or x = 1<br>  <br>  Subs x = 1 into [eqn 2] → y = 7 - 1 = 6<br>  <br>  So the line y + x = 7 touches the circle x^2 + y^2 - 4x - 14y + 51 = 0 at one point only and so it is tangent to the circle at (1, 6)<br>  <br>  [Hmmm ... interesting ... that means that the other curve also touches the circle at the same point]

NPtz1Y4Taa	Description<br>  In Nazi-occupied France in 1941, four-year-old Ruth Kapp learns that it is dangerous to use her own name. "Remember," her older cousin Jeannette warns her, "your name is Renee and you are French!"<br>  <br>  A deeply personal book, this true story recounts the chilling experiences of a young Jewish girl during the Holocaust. The Kapp family flees one home after another, helped by simple, ordinary people from the French countryside who risk their lives to protect them. Eventually the family is forced to separate, and young Ruth survives the war in an orphanage where she is not allowed to see or even mention her parents. Without the trappings of lofty language or the faceless perspective of history, this first-person account poignantly recreates the terror of war seen through the eyes of an innocent child. Your Name Is Renee is a tale of suffering and redemption, fear and hope, which is bound to stir even the most hardened heart.<br>  The subject of this book, Ruth Hartz, was Stacy Cretzmeyer's French teacher at the Springside School in Philadelphia. Today she is a member of the Pennsylvania Holocaust Education Task Force.<br>  <br>  <br>  Oxford University Press: Your Name Is Renée: Stacy Cretzmeyer<br>  ... than 30,000 titles on www.oup.com ... Ruth Kapp Hartz's Story as a Hidden Child in Nazi-Occupied France. Stacy Cretzmeyer ... Author Information. Description ...oup.com/us/catalog/25169/subject/Hist...<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Grade 5-8-Because Ruth Kapp's relatives were German Jews, they were the targets of French as well as German anti-Semitism. Forced to hide their religion, they suffered many hardships, living meagerly and often fleeing from the Gestapo. They were aided by the French resistance as well as by ordinary men and women who took great risks to help them. As the danger increased, Ruth (called Ren?e during her years in France) was sent to an orphanage run by Catholic nuns; in an effort to shield her from German police, she was told to forget her family and faith. The family was eventually reunited, although even after the war, their troubles as Jews were far from over. Although the facts of the story are gripping, and the child's ordeal is heart wrenching, the telling is less so. Frequent flashbacks and attempts to weave in historical information make the story hard to follow, and the narrative is sometimes overly detailed, slowing the pace. However, those who are already interested in Holocaust accounts will find enough here to make this a worthwhile read.

We would always count crackers in a package, if I had more than one kid with me, I would have the kids separate them so every one got an equal amount. (if there were six crackers, and two kids, they would get three crackers a piece.) The kids always found it fun to separate things into equal amounts. Reading to the kids was always something they enjoyed. I would find books that were on their level, or a little above their level and read them to them every day after snack time. It was a treat to get back to the book that we put down yesterday, they used to look forward to it. Just make simple projects that you do every day into learning projects, read the words, and count the numbers, better yet, count everything, from blocks to the holes in their shoes, and your kids will grow up to be ahead of their class even when they start preschool, not only will they be the head of their class, they will always love to learn because it is fun.|`|3d1XRIzkaa	Go to <a href="http://www.Smarter.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.Smarter.com</a><br>  <a href="http://www.pbskids.org.games" rel="nofollow">http://www.pbskids.org.games</a><br>  <a href="http://www.mathrealm.com/Books/Math_and_Literacy.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.mathrealm.com/Books/Math_and_...</a>

qqnC3Xinaa	"Steaking" means nothing.<br>  <br>  "Streaking" means to run in public, naked, often as a dare or prank.<br>  "Staking" is a method of killing vampires with sharpened bits of wood.|`|cWuumdy7aa	As my wife and I were cutting into our third rib-eye steaks of the night, we had a bit of a debate over whether the longissimus or spinalis muscle had the better flavor. (The longissimus is the large muscle in the middle of the rib eye; the spinalis is the one that curves around the edge.) In the end, we both preferred the longissimus.<br>  <br>  It’s easy to geek out on steak even if you don’t know your longissimus from your gluteus maximus. (I didn’t until I looked up rib-eye steak.) Which is the best steakhouse in town? Are you in the tough-but-flavorful camp (flank, skirt, and hanger) or the rich-and-tender brigade (rib eye, strip, and tenderloin)? Grass-fed or grain-fed? Choice or prime?<br>  <br>  I’m going to duck most of those questions in favor of this one: What is dry-aged beef, and is it worth seeking out?<br>  <br>  <br>  Is your T-bone aged wet or dry?One of Seattle’s most respected butcher shops is A&J Meats, atop Queen Anne Hill. Every time I’ve been into A&J, I’ve thought the beef looked a little strange: slightly pale and dry. It turns out that I’m a dope: A&J’s meat looks dry because it is dry. It’s dry-aged for 30 days. This is (spoiler alert!) a good thing.<br>  <br>  Dry aging is a weird idea. You’d expect fresh meat to taste best. But beef, in particular, is improved by taking a large piece of the carcass (in professional terms, a side or primal) and hanging it in a cold, humid, drafty place for one to eight weeks. In the process, the meat loses weight due to evaporation, acquires a moldy, leathery crust, and basically takes on the appearance of Keith Richards. At the end of the aging period, the crust is cut away and the meat sliced into steaks or roasts. You can’t dry-age an individual steak; the result would be jerky.<br>  <br>  Two factors account for the superiority of dry-aged beef. First, there’s that water loss. As the water goes, the flavor of the beef is concentrated. Second, the meat’s own enzymes spill out of the cells and go on a biochemical rampage, tenderizing the muscle fiber and leaving new and various flavor compounds behind. You can think of this as digestion, decay, or, if you’re a romantic, ripening.<br>  <br>  What about wet aging? Wet aging means putting the meat in a vacuum-sealed bag and letting it sit around in the fridge for a few weeks. As you might expect, wet aging is very popular among beef vendors, because it allows them to sell water for the price of beef.<br>  <br>  Okay, that’s not entirely fair. Dry aging is expensive and risky. It requires the producer to pay for a temperature-controlled facility and then watch its beef lose 25 percent or more of its weight. And it requires a leap of faith: Will customers like me pay a minimum of an extra $5 per pound for it?<br>  <br>  AdvertisementTo find out, I withdrew some cash from my steak fund and went shopping. I bought rib eyes from A&J and from my local supermarket, QFC. The supermarket steaks were especially instructive because my local QFC offers dry-aged steaks, aged for a minimum of four weeks, so I was able to purchase the same brand of meat (Certified Angus Beef Natural) in dry-aged and wet-aged versions. The dry-aged steak was $20 a pound at QFC and $17 a pound at A&J (this is a bit misleading, because the QFC steak was trimmed and tied into medallions, meaning more meat and less fat for the money). The wet-aged QFC beef was $15 a pound.<br>  <br>  Steak is not cheap these days. There is currently a shortage of quality beef. The meat I bought at QFC and A&J was USDA Choice grade. If I’d wanted dry-aged USDA Prime beef, I would have had to order online from a top butcher like Lobel's or Peter Luger. A 1-pound rib eye from Lobel’s, with shipping, is $61. Two porterhouses from Peter Luger (serving four to six) will run you $197. My steak fund does not have that kind of money.<br>  <br>  I also went to the farmers’ market and bought a rib eye ($19.50 per pound) from Skagit River Ranch, Washington state’s premier producer of organic, grass-fed beef. Skagit dry-ages its beef for two weeks. I asked proprietor Eiko Vojkovich whether they would hang a special batch for me for six weeks. She explained that I would essentially have to order several cows. Two weeks is better than nothing, though, and it’s certainly better than wet aging.<br>  <br>  Steak suggestions<br>  Saveur’s big July article on steak isn’t available online, but the magazine’s website has a handy list of steak cuts. <br>  <br>  Gourmet also wrote about steak in July; a list on their website explains what all the beef labels mean. <br>  <br>  And last fall, Slate did its own steak taste test. The winner? Beef that had been both grass-fed and dry-aged.<br>  Dry aging is particularly beneficial for meat that, like Skagit’s, will be frozen. “Well-hung meat will emerge from a spell in the freezer with far greater credit than immature, wet meat,” writes Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall, author of The River Cottage Meat Book. His commitment to dry aging (known, morbidly enough, as “hanging” in the U.K.) is total. Dry-aged beef, according to Fearnley-Whittingstall,|`|zxKCVXPZaa	steaking can be termed as a  process of making steak <br>  <br>  steaks is a cut of meat, fish can be The long, ropy diaphragm muscle stands up to marinating and when cooked for a short time over intense heat creates a phenomenal steak. .<br>  <br>  tasty for food if you want to make fish steak <br>  just cut it horizontally marinate with your favorite marinade and cook on a wire mess over coal or can be cooked in oven micro wave or oven|`|Rt8PFjXnaa	Running naked, often at a sports event, and usually after a bet, or too much to drink...|`|7Qpdm6rFaa	go to google   type dictionary  you will get online reference dictionary

Generally, crime rates are falling and have been for years (though certain types have increased) but people are also generally more afraid of crime. <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7511807.stm" rel="nofollow">http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7511807.st...</a><br>  <br>  NB the links are just random examples - there are probably better and more representative stats if you search for them.

7uGMyGn2aa	WW1,also known as the Great War was the greatest and most costly war to date. It began with Serbia and Austria in 1914, but soon escalated, eventually involving 31 countries. In this war there were new weapons such as machine guns, aeroplanes (bombers and fighters) as well as submarines, the flamethrower and from 1916 the tank. Much of the fighting was restricted to trench warfare. In 1917 the US declared war on the Triple Alliance and sent 2 million troops to Europe.

The main obstacle stopping Hitler's invasion was the superior British airforce, resulting in the Battle of Britian, where Hurricanes and Spitfires defended the skies. In 1941 Germany invaded Russia, soon followed by the Japananese attack on Pearl Harbour in December.

utbfT0APaa	The word is , Colonoscopy.Colonoscopy is the endoscopic examination of the large colon and the distal part of the small bowel with a CCD camera or a fiber optic camera on a flexible tube passed through the anus. It may provide a visual diagnosis (e.g. ulceration, polyps) and grants the opportunity for biopsy or removal of suspected lesions. Virtual colonoscopy, which uses 2D and 3D imagery reconstructed from computed tomography (CT) scans or from nuclear magnetic resonance (MR) scans, is also possible, as a totally non-invasive medical test, although it is not standard and still under investigation regarding its diagnostic abilities. Furthermore, virtual colonoscopy does not allow for therapeutic maneuvers such as polyp/tumor removal or biopsy nor visualization of lesions smaller than 5 millimeters. If a growth or polyp is detected using CT colonography, a standard colonoscopy would still need to be performed. Colonoscopy can remove polyps as small as one millimeter or less. Once polyps are removed, they can be studied with the aid of a microscope to determine if they are precancerous or not. Colonoscopy is similar to but not the same as sigmoidoscopy. The difference between colonoscopy and sigmoidoscopy is related to which parts of the colon each can examine. Sigmoidoscopy allows doctors to view only the final two feet of the colon, while colonoscopy allows an examination of the entire colon, which measures four to five feet in length. Often a sigmoidoscopy is used as a screening procedure for a full colonoscopy. In many instances a sigmoidoscopy is performed in conjunction with a fecal occult blood test (FOBT), which can detect the formation of cancerous cells throughout the colon. Other times, a sigmoidoscopy is preferred to a full colonoscopy in patients having an active flare of ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease to avoid perforation of the colon. Additionally, surgeons have lately been using the term pouchoscopy to refer to a colonoscopy of the ileo-anal pouch.<br>  <br>  A colostomy is a surgical procedure that involves connecting a part of the colon onto the anterior abdominal wall, leaving the patient with an opening on the abdomen called a stoma. In a colostomy, the stoma is formed from the end of the large intestine, which is drawn out through the incision and sutured to the skin. After a colostomy, feces leave the patient's body through the abdomen. A colostomy may be permanent or temporary, depending on the reasons for its use.|`|oojO4WAraa	A colostomy is an opening from the colon to a bag on the outside of the body.

NPtz1Y4Taa	Martin Luther King, Jr. (January 15, 1929 – April 4, 1968) was an American clergyman, activist and prominent leader in the African-American civil rights movement. His main legacy was to secure progress on civil rights in the United States and he is frequently referenced as a human rights icon today.<br>  <br>  A Baptist minister,[1] King became a civil rights activist early in his career. He led the 1955 Montgomery Bus Boycott and helped found the Southern Christian Leadership Conference in 1957, serving as its first president.<br>  <br>  King's efforts led to the 1963 March on Washington, where King delivered his “I Have a Dream” speech. There, he raised public consciousness of the civil rights movement and established himself as one of the greatest orators in U.S. history.<br>  <br>  In 1964, King became the youngest person to receive the Nobel Peace Prize for his work to end racial segregation and racial discrimination through civil disobedience and other non-violent means. By the time of his death in 1968, he had refocused his efforts on ending poverty and opposing the Vietnam War, both from a religious perspective.<br>  <br>  King was assassinated on April 4, 1968, in Memphis, Tennessee. He was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1977 and Congressional Gold Medal in 2004; Martin Luther King, Jr. Day was established as a U.S. national holiday in 1986.<br>  Early life<br>  Martin Luther King, Jr., was born on January 15, 1929, in Atlanta, Georgia. He was the son of the Reverend Martin Luther King, Sr. and Alberta Williams King.[2] King's father was born "Michael King", and Martin Luther King, Jr., was originally named "Michael King, Jr.", until the family traveled to Europe in 1934 and visited Germany. His father soon changed both of their names to Martin in honor of the German Protestant leader Martin Luther.[3] He had an older sister, Willie Christine King, and a younger brother Alfred Daniel Williams King.[4] King sang with his church choir at the 1939 Atlanta premiere of the movie Gone with the Wind.[5]<br>  <br>  Growing up in Atlanta, King attended Booker T. Washington High School. He skipped ninth and twelfth grade, and entered Morehouse College at age fifteen without formally graduating from high school.[6] In 1948, he graduated from Morehouse with a Bachelor of Arts degree in sociology,[7] and enrolled in Crozer Theological Seminary in Chester, Pennsylvania, from which he graduated with a Bachelor of Divinity degree in 1951.[8] King then began doctoral studies in systematic theology at Boston University and received his Doctor of Philosophy on June 5, 1955. A 1980s inquiry concluded portions of his dissertation had been plagiarized and he had acted improperly but that his dissertation still "makes an intelligent contribution to scholarship".[9][10]<br>  <br>  King married Coretta Scott, on June 18, 1953, on the lawn of her parents' house in her hometown of Heiberger, Alabama.[11] King and Scott had four children; Yolanda King, Martin Luther King III, Dexter Scott King, and Bernice King.[12] King became pastor of the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church in Montgomery, Alabama when he was twenty-five years old in 1954.[13]<br>  <br>  <br>  Influences<br>  <br>  Populist tradition and Black populism<br>  Harry C. Boyte, a self-proclaimed populist, field secretary of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and white civil rights activist describes an episode in his life that gives insight on King's influences:<br>  <br>  My first encounter with deeper meanings of populism came when I was nineteen, working as a field secretary for the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) in St. Augustine, Florida in 1964. One day I was caught by five men and a woman who were members of the Klu Klux Klan. They accused me of being a “communist and a Yankee.” I replied, “I’m no Yankee – my family has been in the South since before the Revolution. And I’m not a communist. I’m a populist. I believe that blacks and poor whites should join to do something about the big shots who keep us divided.” For a few minutes we talked about what such a movement might look like. Then they let me go.<br>  <br>  When he learned of the incident, Martin Luther King, head of SCLC, told me that he identified with the populist tradition and assigned me to organize poor whites.[14]<br>  <br>  <br>  Thurman<br>  Civil rights leader, theologian, and educator Howard Thurman was an early influence on King. A classmate of King's father at Morehouse College,[15] Thurman mentored the young King and his friends.[16] Thurman's missionary work had taken him abroad where he had met and conferred with Gandhi.[17] When he was a student at Boston University, King often visited Thurman, who was the dean of Marsh Chapel.[18] Walter Fluker, who has studied Thurman's writings, has stated, "I don't believe you'd get a Martin Luther King, Jr. without a Howard Thurman".[19]<br>  <br>  <br>  Gandhi and Rustin<br>  Inspired by Gandhi's success with non-violent activism, King visited the Gandhi family in India in 1959, with assistance from the Quaker group the Am

lVRmXHGcaa	Please, DON'T freak out about getting a B. Ivy Leagues accept people not only based on GPA and grades, and if that's all you're worrying about in high school, you can pretty much say goodbye to a future in Ivy League. I'm not at ALL trying to be rude, discouraging, or unhelpful, I'm just saying that Ivy Leagues require very well-rounded students. Many times, Ivy Leagues will accept a student with multiple B's, but have great extracurriculars, leadership roles, volunteer/community work, etc. over a perfect A student. For example, I know of a person who received acceptance to Harvard with a 3.69 GPA, but great extracurriculars and was very well-rounded. <br>  <br>  All in all, I'm just trying to explain that getting a B in an elective is far from the end of the world when applying to Ivy League. Instead of getting more upset, try focusing on getting more extracurriculars going, or even create a club yourself!<br>  <br>  I hope I was of some assistance, and feel free to e-mail me for additional information. Best of luck!<br>  <br>  -Leah|`|34VXCyvVaa	Yes, they count electives in the GPA.

6Kq1ExFxaa	Well i'm on my way to getting an AA and it depends on which course you are following. But the idea is to show what you did and explain how you did it. Analyse another artisit's work, pick out  key points and put them into your work. Write down all of this as it gets you extra marks. But what's the name of the course you're doing, there is about 60 different courses which lead to the Art GCSE. Remember the coursework is really important and just do as much work as you can. You NEED first hand photos and evidence. Research as many artists as possible and turn the research pages in to pieces of art as well. Do different types of drawings and make deliberate mistakes and redraw them to show that you learnt. Everyone in my school last year got AA in Art.|`|f1lpdiNEaa	I had my heart set on an A at GCSE Art but I got a B in the end.<br>  <br>  I was told I had put all my efforts into my final piece and not spent  enough time presenting the research and coursework to go with it.

AA11894640	Endless repayment through cycles of re-birth...or instant Karma!|`|6dL7UGvfaa	This is the Law of Karma that runs creation. We are determined by the consequences of our action that is inescapable.|`|A01w1dHqaa	What you do for another, you do for yourself because thee is no separation.|`|AA11511615	You do good, you receive good.....you do bad, you receive bad.|`|QCejFqXgaa	Blessing, Pretty Interesting Question!.....Karma is not a really difficult topic to understand. It is spoken about in many of the sacred texts of all the worlds religions and is implied in the Golden Rule: Do unto others as you would have them do unto you. The implication: as you treat others, so you will be treated. What is difficult to grasp about karma is when it is actually playing a role in your life. The survivor of abuse, who may not have ever hurt anyone in his/her life (this time around), may wonder what s/he did to deserve such treatment. Perhaps in a previous life, the same soul was the perpetrator of abuse. Then the promise of karma would be in force. On the other hand, perhaps the soul "accepted" the abuse because it possesses the strength to survive, learn and STOP the cycle of abuse. Another more obtuse application of karma might be a young adult who finds him/herself bound to a wheelchair from a hit and run driver. Why did it happen? Perhaps in a previous life, this soul was a corrupt judge who imprisoned those who would not bow to his corrupt ways. This unjust imprisonment of others has resulted in the seemingly unjust imprisonment of their body in their current incarnation. Not every tragedy we live through is the result of some terrible wrong we did in our past life. A child who dies of an illness at an early age, for example, might simply have chosen to experience the birth and young adult stages of life before deciding what he wanted to do with his life as an adult in his next incarnation.<br>  <br>  Karma is inescapable. Your actions DO return to you. It may not be in this lifetime, but it certainly will return to you. How you deal with the return of this karmic energy determines whether or not you bring your soul further into balance or create more karmic energy that must be dealt with at a later date. If you seek to learn from the seeming injustices in your life, chances are that you will be balancing your karmic books rather than increasing your karmic debt.<br>  <br>  For me, it was helpful to look at karma as a sort of credit card. Each time we do something in our lives motivated by love, we are "paying off" some of the karmic debt we have built up over our many lifetimes. Each time we act in selfish interest, we are charging something else to our credit card. The goal is not to have a credit due us, because in doing so, it would mean that someone, somewhere, still owed some debt. The goal is to get our balance to zero. To pay off our karmic credit card and make no more charges on it. Then we will have reached our goal and there will be no need to return to this physical plane and we will once again be reunited with the Divine.<br>  <br>  Karma is often thought about as being some debt we are repaying from a past life. But karma can be "paid" in the same lifetime it is created. We can read in many sacred texts that what you sow is what you reap, what you give comes back to you three times over, as you do, so it shall be done to you. All of these are speaking of karma. Even Jesus spoke of karma when he said we should do unto others as we would have it done unto us since that is exactly what will happen.|`|zxKCVXPZaa	if your understand hindi then it is -- jo boya hai wahi katoge or there is doha -- boya per babool ka to aam kahan se hoye -<br>  <br>  further to explain for example if you are not studying or doing work properly then you will definately fail only.means what ever you are doing the same you will get , if you are doing good you will get good ,<br>  if bad then bad only will return <br>  so do good and get good ..................|`|QS6hSdZNaa	" Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever man soweth, that shall he reap, For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting " --The Bible --Galatians 6:7,8|`|y2pErbI2aa	It means that your actions have consequences, whether in this life or the next.

Whatever clubs/orginizations does your school offer. Get involved in whatever your interest is. When I was in highschool, I did the drama club, art club, library club, and service work. Hope I helped. You are already involved in quite a lot. you'll do great.|`|UA8USXFNaa	My advice to you would be to pick maybe three activities (ones that you actually enjoy, preferably!) and really concentrate on them. So maybe one or two voluntary activities, a club of some sort in an area which interests you, and perhaps a sport or musical instrument. There's no point doing masses of different things, because universities want to see some dedication and real enthusiasm and if you do a little bit of lots of things instead of a lot of a few things you aren't demonstrating that. It would also be great if you could show some real achievement in some of these things, like becoming team captain in a sport or president of a club, or being given a position of responsibility in your voluntary work, and you won't be able to achieve any of that unless you put the time and effort in. Also, by your own admission you don't currently have the grades to go to a top uni. I think your time would be better spent ensuring that you get as many As as possible, rather than cramming in all these extra curriculars. Although extra curriculars are important, they are nowhere near as important as grades in the UK - this is an area where our system really differs from the US. The personal statement you write when applying to universities only allows a certain amount of words (about half an A4 page), and you need to spend most of that talking about your interest in the subject you are applying for - there just isn't room to talk about your extra curriculars at length, so it's best you just have three that you are passionate about instead of a long list that just looks meaningless. So long as you have a couple of things to talk about outside school and have the grades, you will be fine getting into a top uni. Good luck!

WKsGpvEIaa	Here's some info.  I put the links I found in the sources section. Hope it helps.<br>  <br>  In 1856, during Easter vacation from the Royal College of Chemistry, 18-year-old William Henry Perkin (1838–1907) synthesized mauve, or aniline purple—the first synthetic dyestuff—from chemicals derived from coal tar. Like Friedrich W?hler's accidental synthesis of urea, Perkin's chemical manipulations were designed to produce a quite different product—quinine. His teacher, August W. Hofmann, one of Justus von Liebig's former students, had remarked on the desirability of synthesizing this antimalarial drug, which at that time was derived solely from the bark of the cinchona tree, by then grown mainly on plantations in southeast Asia. Against Hofmann's recommendation and with the financial support of his father, a construction contractor, Perkin commercialized his discovery and developed the processes for the production and use of the new dye. In 1857 he opened his factory at Greenford Green, not far from London.<br>  <br>  From this modest beginning grew the highly innovative chemical industry of synthetic dyestuffs and its near relative, the pharmaceutical industry, which improved the quality of life for the general population. These two industries also stimulated the search for a better understanding of the structure of molecules. Perkin, at the age of 36, sold his business so that he could devote himself entirely to research, which included early investigations of the ability of some organic chemicals to rotate plane-polarized light, a property used in considering questions of molecular structure.<br>  <br>  Born: 12-Mar-1838<br>  Birthplace: London, England<br>  Died: 14-Jul-1907<br>  Location of death: London, England<br>  Cause of death: unspecified<br>  <br>  <br>  Gender: Male<br>  Race or Ethnicity: White<br>  Occupation: Chemist<br>  <br>  Nationality: England<br>  Executive summary: Invented mauve<br>  <br>  English chemist, born in London on the 12th of March 1838. From an early age he determined to adopt chemistry as his profession, although his father, who was a builder, would have preferred him to be an architect. Attending the City of London School he devoted all his spare time to chemistry, and on leaving, in 1853, entered the Royal College of Chemistry, then under the direction of August Wilhelm von Hofmann, in whose own research laboratory he was in the course of a year or two promoted to be an assistant. Devoting his evenings to private investigetions in a rough laboratory fitted up at his home, Perkin was fired by some remarks of Hofmann's to undertake the artificial production of quinine. In this attempt he was unsuccessful, but the observations he made in the course of his experiments induced him, early in 1856, to try the effect of treating aniline sulphate with bichromate of potash. The result was a precipitate, aniline black, from which he obtained the coloring matter subsequently known as aniline blue or mauve. He lost no time in bringing this substance before the managers of Pullar's dye works, Perth, and they expressed a favorable opinion of it, if only it should not prove too expensive in use. Thus encouraged, he took out a patent for his process, and leaving the College of Chemistry, and as a boy of eighteen he proceeded, with the aid of his father and brother, to erect works at Greenford Green, near Harrow, for the manufacture of the newly discovered coloring matter, and by the end of 1857 the works were in operation. That date may therefore be reckoned as that of the foundation of the coal-tar color industry, which has since attained such important dimensions -- in Germany, however, rather than in England the country where it originated. Perkin also had a large share in the introduction of artificial alizarin, the red dye of the madder root. C. Graebe and C. T. Lieberrnann in 1868 prepared that substance synthetically from anthracene, but their process was not practicable on a large scale, and it was left to him to patent a method that was commercially valuable. This he did in 1869, thus securing for the Greenford Green works a monopoly of alizarin manufacture for several years. About the same time he also carried out a series of investigations into kindred substances, such as anthrapurpurin. About 1874 he abandoned the manufacture of coal-tar colors and devoted himself exclusively to research in pure chemistry, and among the discoveries he made in this field was that of the reaction known by his name, depending on the condensation of aldehydes with fatty acids. Later still he engaged in the study of the relations between chemical constitution and rotation of the plane of polarization in a magnetic field, and enunciated a law expressing the variation of such rotation in bodies belonging to homologous series. For this work he was in 1889 awarded a Davy medal by the Royal Society, which ten years previously had bestowed upon him a Royal medal in recognition of his investigations in the coal-tar colors. The Chemical Society, of which he became secretary in 1869 and|`|0jlG2clBaa	<a href="http://www.jergym.hiedu.cz/~canovm/mechanic/pravidl2/per/p.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.jergym.hiedu.cz/~canovm/mecha...</a>|`|uniAnFF7aa	<a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Perkin" rel="nofollow">http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Pe...</a>

This dates back (or so I have heard) to the days when swords were the most common weapon, because if you were right handed you would weild your sword by drawing it from a scabbard that would be on the left side of your body. Shaking hands with someone proved that you weren't about to go for your sword and run them through, because the only hand that could easily draw the sword was being used in a greeting.|`|ekS19dWYaa	I heard that the handshake has dated back to the times of the roman empires.

AA10176626	There is no way to determine how much money a financial aid applicant will receive from his/her EFC score, alone.<br>  <br>  I can tell you that your EFC is too high for you to qualify as an applicant with "exceptional need", which means that you are not eligible for the special "need-based" aid programs that are offered to the most needy students. Those include the programs like the Pell Grant, and the Perkins Loan.<br>  <br>  You will, however, qualify for the largest federal student aid program, the Stafford Loan - you, and the 2/3 of all financial aid applicants who do not demonstrate 'exceptional need'. This is the government's general purpose student aid program.<br>  <br>  With a Stafford loan, you will be eligible to borrow up to $5500 in your freshman year. This loan will be entirely in your name, and you won't need a cosigner. The application does not ask any questions about your income, your debt, or your credit history - nor do they care about your parents' situation - it's not their loan.<br>  <br>  You'll have 10 years to repay the loan, and the payments don't begin until you have been out of school for 6 months. There are no better educational lending programs available to the general public.<br>  <br>  You MAY qualify for additional financial assistance from ASU - some schools have their own funds that they're able to use to assist aid applicants. I can't guess if they'll have money for you - you'll have to wait until you receive your aid offer letter.<br>  <br>  When your school has put together its best possible aid package, they will tell you about that package in an aid offer letter that describes what programs and how much aid they can offer you. The letter will also include detailed instructions on what you must do to accept and receive the aid you have been offered. Be sure to follow the instructions carefully, and deal with it right away, so as to avoid any delays in the aid processing.<br>  <br>  I hope this information helped you - good luck!

Colleges WILL look at your junior year marks, especially if they are considering you for scholarships. If you want to get into science/tech programs, you may need to give up some of your other commitments to focus on school (this might not be too important now, but definitely remember that in your senior year you want to make that application as attractive as possible). If you want to get into a lib. arts type program, I would let the marks slide a little bit and focus on all the other things you are doing, since these are just as important in a lib. arts application (again, esp. for a scholarship).<br>  <br>  Finally, yeah you can always do better but don't beat yourself up about getting lower marks. The jump from sophmore to junior is really tough on a lot of people, and marks drop quite a bit. And yeah, Bs don't look great on a report card, but you need to pinpoint what you need to do better in and focus on those things. Eg. if you want to go into accounting, a B in Media Studies won't hurt nearly as much as a B in math! The marks you have are pretty average; they aren't great by any means, so whereever you can improve, make sure you do!!<br>  <br>  Good luck in everything!

AA10176626	Okama:<br>  <br>  You are misunderstanding the financial aid use of the word "dependent". We're all used to words that have different meanings, depending on the context in which they are used, but for some reason, everyone assumes that financial aid dependency is either the same thing as income tax dependency or - that it's simply a matter of who you live with, or whether you "rely" on your parents.<br>  <br>  Financial aid dependency is a completely different issue than any of those things. It doesn't matter where you live, it doesn't matter if your mom or your dad, or no one claims you as an income tax dependent. It doesn't matter if you work or not. It doesn't matter if you live with your grandmother. It doesn't matter if your parents support you, or if they've already told you that "you're on your own" if you want to go to college.<br>  <br>  Think about this for a second, and you will understand why. Suppose I wanted to attend a really expensive college that my parents couldn't pay for - in fact, they laughed when I said I wanted to go there, because it was so outrageously implausible.<br>  <br>  What if the solution were as simple as just saying "What we'll do is tell the government that my parents won't pay. That way, the government will give me a whole bunch of money, and I'll be able to go!"<br>  <br>  Or maybe a whole bunch of parents just decide: "If the government will pay if I don't, then why the heck should I pay? I'll just refuse to pay for my kid's college, and that way the taxpayers will pay, instead."<br>  <br>  A system like that is too open to abuse - so that's not the way the system works. Here's how it does work:<br>  <br>  The financial aid program is established with the underlying premise that the student and the student's parents are primarily responsible for paying the cost of a college education. The analysis is not based on whether the parents want to pay, the analysis is based on how much the parents could reasonably be expected to pay. <br>  <br>  If the parents are not willing to contribute to the cost of their child's education, that doesn't change the financial aid eligibility. The eligibility is based entirely on what the student's need would be ASSUMING that the parents did their part. If the parents won't do their part, the taxpayers do not step in and do the parents' part for them.<br>  <br>  Long story short - you will be considered a dependent student for financial aid purposes until:<br>  <br>  You turn 24.<br>  <br>  You get married.<br>  <br>  You provide more than 50% of the financial support for dependents of your own.<br>  <br>  You go to graduate school.<br>  <br>  You become an orphan, or a ward of the court.<br>  <br>  You join the US military.<br>  <br>  You are granted the status of "financially emancipated minor" by court order.<br>  <br>  I'll repeat - again - that the rules do not change if you move out, or if your parents refuse to give you money, or if you turn 18.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry, but yours is an issue that is faced by tens of thousands of students every year, and the rules are specifically set up to avoid the situation where the taxpayers are expected to pick up the slack for parents who have decided that they're not paying for their kids to go to college.<br>  <br>  No matter how much your father made last year, you will qualify for federal student aid - so would Bill Gates' daughter, Jennifer. The form of aid that you will qualify for is a Stafford Loan, the government's outstanding college lending program. You will be able to borrow up to $5500 in your freshman year, and this loan will be in your own name - your parents will not be responsible for the loan, in any way. You won't need to answer income, debt or credit history questions, and you won't need a cosigner. Your payment obligation won't begin until you have been out of school for 6 months, and the interest rate is low and fixed - you won't find that with any other type of student loan.<br>  <br>  If you're thinking that $5500 isn't sufficient to allow you to attend your dream school, there's a good chance that it won't. Financial aid is not designed or intended to enable students to attend their dream schools. You get to go to a dream school if your parents can afford it, and if you earn the grades that will qualify you for scholarships.<br>  <br>  Financial aid is intended to help you afford to obtain AN education. If you will be relying exclusively on financial aid, you will need to choose a very affordable school that your aid can cover. You might need to start out at a community college, in the hope of earning scholarship support to a more costly 4-year school for your junior and senior years.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry for the disappointing news, but this is how the system is designed. You can not improve your financial aid by moving out on your own and trying to establish a poverty case.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you.|`|RPpXarDDaa	no, infact it may help your aid. if you are indepedent and you work but don't have enough income...it could really help. some states pay for low income people to go to school

In today's job market and economy a bachelors degree is really needed to be competitive within your field and ideally you will hold a masters degree which should earn you between 50-70,000 dollars a year.|`|6f5395773cce7a0187fdf217ce48b5e9aa	Actually it depends on what the major is.  Associate degrees in technical trades can you a good paying job right away.  On the other hand, a general liberal arts major would be near useless.  However, the same argument can be made for a bachelors degree in the liberal arts as well.|`|VBTnJ8dJaa	They are right, you really can't get anywhere with an associates degree. the good thing is that community colleges are usually less expensive and a quick commute. The way I look at it is that it was a good way for me to ease into figuring out what I wanted to major in without losing out on mega bucks. I found it smart to go to a local CC and get my core courses out of the way for cheap (math, english, etc.). Then I transferred those credits to a 4-year school where I completed all of the interesting courses that my major was in. <br>  Keep in mind that while you don't have to do 4 years of school there, not every credit from the CC will transfer. But at least you won't be changing majors like crazy. I didn't want to go to school for 4 years and then get a job in a completely different field.|`|6YbxTlDCaa	it depends on the emphasis. Business would be a good area, but you really have to consider what your ultimate goals are, as this may limit your earning potential.  Perhaps it would better for you to look into a specialized school. At college graduation I noticed that many graduates of various majors were being hired by non major-related employers. Banks and other businesses were  hiring whoever had a degree (4 yr)<br>  Pay a visit to your community college career center. There you will get all the answers you need.

AA10023710	There are a lot of tech and trade programs at community colleges, and ccs are reputable and always your least expensive option. I'd have you check out the websites of the ccs near you first, and see what they offer. <br>  <br>  If you're interested in a trade, also check the websites for your local chapters of the trade unions.

Go home and underline or put star next to topics disscussed in class. Put extra star on a topic which was discussed for a longer time. Chances are test questions will come out of there. Also ask your professor ," will you give test question out side of your lecture?" Means...topics which he didn't cover,, but are in the book.<br>  Look at the first test and see how he gave question? <br>  Don't wait till the last minute. Have 2 reviews for every test.

zhJOZhKEaa	With lots of little ones and your schooling it will be a struggle at times... but no more of a struggle than getting her up and ready for school each day.  Even if she stays in public school you will want to be 'up' on what she is doing in school and such... you aren't really working that much more to just do it yourself.  You already 'know' her so you will teach to her needs.  Homeschooling is very 'efficient' that way.  :)<br>  <br>  I've taught public high school full time while homeschooling a second grader.  The toughest part is keeping involved with the local homeschooling group... keeping him 'going' in his activities and seeing his buddies.  But it was still 'doable'... with the help of my MIL and the other homeschooling parents we did just fine.  <br>  <br>  Now I'm home but have an 12 yr old, 5 yr old, 3 1/2 yr old and 21 month old.  That too is a bit 'exciting' at times... <grin>... but doable.<br>  <br>  I know several homeschool mamas who are in school full time.  They do occationally need someone to 'take up the slack' for them.  (IE do their 'mommy chores' in the homeschool theater group for them.)   They also may play catchup in their child's schooling over their own school breaks sometimes... but they get things done.<br>  <br>  I think you will do great if you are willing to be flexable and not feel like a 'failure' if the least little thing isn't done just how or when you wanted to do it.  That is sometimes a struggle for *any* new homeschooler.  Don't worry if you don't 'do' things like a public school or even just like your chosen curriculum wants things done.  <br>  <br>  Be flexable and use your 'support systems' as I'm sure you have already with the little ones... and you will be just fine!  Have fun!|`|c55O7jqXaa	Of course you can. I know some parents that work full time and still find the time to home school. Homeschooling does not have to take place at the school hours, but rather anytime of the day. Also they can learn in a few hours what kids in Public Schools learn in a day or two. <br>  <br>  Give yourself more credit than that. You are their Mom and who better to teach them than you.<br>  <br>  I say give it a try. Nothing ventured nothing gained. If for some reason it doesn't work out for you or your Daughter than find another alternative. <br>  <br>  With Abeka they can pretty much sit down and do most of it themselves. My Sister in law does ABeka and she loves it and she has 3 girls. <br>  <br>  We are real eclectic and don't use a curriculum. My Daughter is a self learner so we do whatever it takes for her to learn the material. I don't work though so I have plenty of time to spend on that. <br>  <br>  Good luck with your journey. It is a wonderful one.|`|9Ute4yidaa	No actually after you home school for a while, you find out that your kids will teach them selves (except for the occasional question they will ask you) you can leave them at home those days (or bring them with you) and bring their books along too, and just have them work on it. :) I'm home schooled and i enjoy it SO much! You kids will REALLY appreciate it when they get older! I'd say go for it. EVERYONE is scared at first but after they do it, they're SO glad they made the step!!!<br>  GOOD LUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :D|`|oqK4ADssaa	As long as you have someone willing to watch your kids while you are in school you can do it. I work a couple of days a week and home school. My mother in law watches the kids for 50.00 a week and does school with them. She's come a long way since we first started home schooling (she was totally against it). Good Luck|`|b4859935d2256537b4d4fe1dd1d4888faa	Oh brother. I love these people who are worried about parents not being qualified to teach.  What a load of crap.  My mom has put two kids in college (both on practically full scholarships) and she only has her high school diploma.<br>  I think your schedule could work two your advantage or not.  It depends on how you approach it.  With homecshooling you can really do it whenever you want, day, evening, weekday, weekend, it doesn't matter.  Until you finish school you could even take the unschooling approach and do school on your kids time.  <br>  And don't be scared!  Talk to other homeschool parents in your area for advice.  See how they would work with a similar schedule and what ideas they have for you.|`|eqqpIbTsaa	I think that you could do it!  I am 14 and I am home schooled and I Love It!!  Just make sure that you always put your kids first! I mainly work on Mondays, Wednesday, and Friday and Sundays I am doing home schooling with flvs.net. So I work 4 days a week and I could do it!|`|6fVzzNhiaa	That is a lot to be carrying all at once, but I've heard of people managing to keep all the balls in the air at once.  We all have different talents.<br>  <br>  The problem with using a highly-structured program such as Abeka (especially in for a 5-year old child), is that the amount of I-dotting and T-crossing work required by the program could lead to burn-out, both for you and your child.  Pressure on you to fulfill the program's requirements = pressure on the child as well.<br>  <br>  I understand that your oldest child is as old as he or she has ever been, and may appear to 'need academics.'   That is common with a parent's handling of the first-born child.  (been there [and was that],  & have both the child & parent T-shirts   ;>  )  But still, a 5-year old is young and pressure can wait.  Waldorf-inspired or Montessori-style homeschooling would enable you to fit in your 5-year old's activities with those of your younger children.<br>  <br>  (with the benefit of 20/20 hindsight  <g>  ) I wouldn't be as afraid of "failure" (at homeschooling) as I would about changing the parent/child relationship into a teacher/student relationship.  That's harder to maintain and can stress all of you.|`|cMZEmpp0aa	As long as you have child care arranged for the kids during those two days, I don't see why it would be a huge problem (though you need to check the laws in your area). My bigger concern is that you want to use A Beka....a few years ago, the University of California system decided it wouldn't accept high school credits from homeschoolers or other schools that used the A Beka program because it was lacking in academic content. I believe the science curriculum was the main target. Unfortunately I haven't been able to find any follow-up articles to see if the situation was resolved, and every article I CAN find on the matter is insanely biased either for or against the decision, but I would still recommend that you think long and hard about the decision to use A Beka, especially if you plan on long-term homeschooling. There are plenty of other Christian curricula out there with solid academic content.

63c6ad890d0828ff609c53ea0a1378e0aa	Yes, the fact that stations are showing people having simulated sex, sometime actual sex on daytime TV, I believe is not for little children.<br>  Children grow up too fast anyway, and showing the sex act on TV I believe should not be done.<br>  This is only my opinion. And we now know that little children are being anesthetized against violence by the repeated killing of people on TV programs. It seems so simple to them, you get angry with a person in your school, you don't try to work out your problems, you simple find a way to kill them. The long term implication of murder does not soak into the child's consciousness, and the results of such actions, he does not yet understand.

Use the word "percentage" when you are not including a specific number.

Two examples are:<br>  <br>  *The new graduate nurse was in the top tenth percentile of her graduating class.<br>  <br>  The nurse's age placed him in the lowest tenth percentile of all the nurses.<br>  <br>  Recheck the use of the word "percentile" when you write or edit a manuscript, because interchanging the word with "percent" can incorrectly report the data.

So if you want a B which is about 83 then you would subtract 28.11 from 83 to get 54.89 then you divide by the two remaining tests to get 27.445 then you divide that by 33.3 which means you need to average an 82.41 percent on your next two tests. <br>  To find your current grade you need to take 28.011 and divide it by 33.3 which is an 84 percent|`|fe0PZgrEaa	i think it would be something like<br>  <br>  (final) = 33.3(67) + 33.3(exam2) + 33.3(exam3) that will give u an exam estimate<br>  as for the quizzes take the average of those so 90+95+100= 285<br>  then divide by 3 for the average. 285/3 = 95<br>  So once you get your final exam calculate the totals and take 25 percent of it and that's what your 95 quiz average should help. <br>  <br>  for the record each teacher grades differently and they might take into account attendance, participation etc.|`|AA10928214	why don't you just study really really hard and get an A!!!!, You're gonna have to get at least B's on the rest of the tests to bring the 67 up

51e15a40a62db9f2e165d0a6a8359b6baa	As a writer, I love these types of challenges. I would hope for the future, you would try to be creative about this as well, but here's a suggestion:<br>  <br>  In the middle of the story, create a bit of 'lover's tension between Alicia and her boyfriend (make this part up as you like). But the interesting twist is that LISA is the one falsely creating this tension between the B/F and ALICIA. Ultimately, have Lisa gently prodding, pushing and suggesting that ALICIA take some sort of jealous reaction to her B/F. Maybe, ALICIA plans her boyfriend's demise for cheating on her. As the story closes, ALICIA has sent the B/F's car off the cliff and LISA knows that ALICIA is definitely the only one who can take the blame for it. Lisa hurts Alicia by making her responsible for killing the boyfriend who wasn't really cheating... It leads readers to think just how responsible is Lisa for Alicia's actions? She didn't really MAKE ALICIA do the things she does, but she does help them along...<br>  <br>  Hope this gets the creative juices flowing!|`|xjBFwsVMaa	Well you could have it that Lisa pretends to get really close to Alicia jus so Lisa can end up getting more popular and get a make over from Alicia. Then she takes Alicia's man and cuts the break lines to her car...

It's not worth putting off for a future than may never come.|`|u7KqSCs2aa	Way to go in the diploma for technical drafting.  Understanding that you want to pay off your student loan, I would recommend that you try to work part time or find a compatible schedule that would let you go to school at night, or maybe you might find something online that you could go to school for.  After all President Obama just said that we should all go to school for at least a year to get additional job training.  You will be able to help out the country with the higher taxes you would be paying, and have a more secure future for yourself and your family.  Be wise, try to get as many grants as you can, and then try to get the scholarships before going into debt with even more student loans.  Even if you can only afford to pay off a semester at a time, some people take twice as long to get other degrees by just taking a limited number of classes, not the full semester load.  Part time school is another means to the end.  Good luck with your goals.|`|AA10023710	It depends on what field you want to enter.<br>  <br>  In many circumstances, you should be able to stay at your current job and go to school part-time. This is the best of both worlds - you keep your job, so you can pay for school without taking out tons of loans, and yet you get the degree you need in order to advance. This usually works best if your plan is to advance within your current field, or one quite related to it. <br>  <br>  In fact, find out if your current employer offers any sort of tuition reimbursment or tuition aid plan. If they do, they may help you pay for college, if you work for them and go to school part-time. <br>  <br>  I'd only have you quit your job and go back to school full time if:<br>  1) the field you plan to study is in very, very high demand, like nursing, and<br>  2) the field is unrelated to your current job, and thus you need to go to school full time so you have time to do internships to build your resume for your new career.<br>  <br>  Otherwise, I'd rather you keep your job and go to school part-time.

All eyes turned to the man who limped his way over to Matt.<br>  <br>  "CHESTER!!!!  When you took your Ticket To Ride back east, I never thought I'd see you, again!!" The two old friends embraced.<br>  <br>  "Awwwww, Mister Dillon. You Really Got A Hold On Me, you know. I just HAD to come back for a visit."<br>  <br>  Matt stepped back. "Uhhhhh, Chester.....You Like Me Too Much. Uhhhhh......been good seeing you."<br>  <br>  "But Mister Dillon. I thought....."<br>  <br>  Matt put his arm around Sunshine: "This Boy loves this girl.......... Dig It." as they walked off, Matt muttered "Damn. No shootout.....Happiness Is a Warm Gun, you know." Sunshine assured him that there were other ways to be happy.<br>  <br>  "Ohhhhhhh yeah....I  forgot. "<br>  Matt threw her over his massive shoulder and strolled on back to Cell # 3.<br>  <br>  Chester dropped his chin to his chest as he went over to the Long Branch. " Miss Kitty. He done broke my heart."<br>  <br>  "Well JOIN THE CLUB!!!!! He done broke mine the day he left me for that moron from Virginia." Kitty took another gulp of her Randy Scouse Git Rotgut."

More and more people have education after K-12 and you need to keep up with them or you get shunted into the lowest rungs of the economy.

7ae938d47fa5ab107ff81fe42738c6a4aa	You need to check with your financial aid office to see how much aid you will be receiving.  Your financial aid award will only cover all of your expenses if you use all of the aid offered to you.  Some students only use the grant portion of their aid package and do not borrow through the loan programs.  The student and his/her family will have to cover out of pocket what expenses, including books, are not covered by the aid that is taken.<br>  <br>  For example, a college will process an aid package based on a cost of attendance budget which often includes tuition, fees, room, board, books, travel, miscellaneous (laundry, etc..).  If this total cost is $20,000 and the EFC from the FAFSA is $5,000, then the family will have $15,000 of need that the financial aid package will try to fill.  The package could consist of a college scholarship of $5,000, a Federal Work Study Award of $2,000, Federal Student Loans of $5,500 and a Federal Parent Loan of $7,500. If the family is not going to take out any loans, then all the aid that will be applied towards the student bill will be the $5,000 college scholarship.  This amount will be applied to the bill and the rest will have to be paid by the family.|`|yig566gEaa	If it is your friends that is telling you financial aid doesnt cover it then they may have their information wrong. The college that i attend and work at does cover books, as long as you recieve enough financial aid to do so.|`|AA10176626	Lori:<br>  <br>  Financial aid CAN cover books - the question is whether you received sufficient financial aid to cover ALL of your costs.<br>  <br>  If your friends are going to school with no money "out of pocket", it means that they were offered enough aid to pay for their tuition, their school fees, their books and their equipment and supplies.<br>  <br>  If your school is insisting that you still owe additional money for books, then it seems that you didn't qualify for enough aid to cover everything.<br>  <br>  Financial aid is not a system that enables students to go to school for free. The vast, vast, vast majority of financial aid recipients are receiving a sum of aid that HELPS them afford school every year. <br>  <br>  Trust me when I tell you that there are many students who pay tens of thousands of dollars for school every year, even after their financial aid has been applied to their school bills.<br>  <br>  It is very unusual to receive sufficient financial aid to cover all of your school expenses - it is far more the exception than the rule. I'm amazed, actually, that you seem to know so many people who are enjoying that unusual privilege.<br>  <br>  Again - if your school is telling you that you're on your own for books, you should consider yourself fortunate that you have been awarded enough aid to pay for everything else. A lot of students would like to be in your position. Do not compare yourself with your friends, because their financial circumstances are different than yours.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you. I hope this helps.

16g7IucOaa	well you are taking maths at HL (omg - big congratz!) so as far as i know the king's college of london and LSE (i know only about universities in UK) would accept you. i advise you to write to the uni you want to go and ask them, because as far as IB is concerned some unis have different requirements. i have taken history HL and was really happy about it but it is a lot of work with it. it IS possible to get 45/45 points as these lucky people really exist ;o) <br>  as for books - ask your teacher maybe? i bet there are some new editions. <br>  just one more advice - do A LOT of mock exams. they extremely help. you know what to expect and what questions may be on the exam (e.g. on history exam there is always a question on The League of Nations). <br>  good luck and have fun! i had more work and sleepless nights in IB than on my law course at uni :D

Then call or email the admissions departments at the schools if your still not clear on what to do.|`|AA10023710	Unlike in the UK, you can not study law for your bachelors degree in the US. In the US, it is a post-graduate program only. You can not go to Yale or Harvard right now and study law. You'd need a bachelors degree in another subject first. <br>  <br>  If you have your heart set on law, your best bet is to stay in the UK. That's not only because law is offered at the undergraduate level in the UK, but also because the study of law is region-specific. You can't study law in the US and practice in the UK. All your knowledge would be of US law. <br>  <br>  To get into a US  university, you may need to take the US's SAT exam, which is their college entrance exam. However, check the info for international applicants on each uni's web page, as that does vary. <br>  <br>  You would need a student visa. <br>  <br>  You can take a gap year if you'd like to, or not. It won't necessarily help or hurt your application, unless you drift aimlessly during that year, sitting on the sofa and eating snacks while watching telly. If you do take a gap year, do something valuable with that time. Travel, or volunteer, or work. Don't just drift.

s9tvr0DTaa	There are about 1000 types of breads and descriptions here ....<br>  <br>  Have fun and good luck!|`|r3QbyYSSaa	1. Flatbread -When the Hebrew people fled Egypt during the legendary Exodus, they were forced to make unleavened (flat) bread in their haste. Leviticus declares a feast commemorating the exodus using flatbread. <br>  In the most basic form, grinding grains, adding water, and heating it produces whole grain flatbread<br>  <br>  2. Sprouted Bread -The bible also gives one of the earliest recipes for sprouted grain bread. <br>  Sprouted grain bread has increased in popularity in recent years. Traditional bread is made from ground flour from the hardened kernel of grain. <br>  Sprouted grain bread involves soaking the grain and allowing it to sprout. The sprouted seedlings are then mashed together and baked. <br>  Sprouting allows the enzymes in the grain to convert some of the carbohydrates and fats to vitamins, minerals, and amino acids. <br>  Due to the changes that take place, sprouted grain bread typically is higher in protein, fiber, and certain vitamins and minerals than regular bread. It is also less refined and processed than even stone ground wheat bread, so it has less of an impact on your blood sugar.<br>  <br>  3. Whole Grain bread -In 400 BC, around the time when Socrates was providing sage dietary advice, Plato imagined an ideal world. In this world, men would live to a ripe old age. Their main source of sustenance would be whole grain bread from local wheat, yeast is added so that the bread rises. <br>  <br>  4. White Bread -The Age of Refined Bread <br>  As early as 1826, the whole grain bread used by the military was called superior for health to the white, refined bread used by the aristocracy. In fact, the term refined today comes from this fact. <br>  Before the industrial revolution, it was more labor consuming (and therefore costly) to refine bread, so white bread was the main staple for aristocracy. This made them “refined”.Many commercial types of bread are highly refined. Enriched breads have the original nutrients stripped out and replaced with inferior, often lesser quantities of standard vitamins and minerals. <br>  Some companies will try to produce wholesome-looking bread by adding grains to the outside, even when the main ingredient is enriched bread. High fructose corn syrup is often added as a sweetener<br>  <br>  5. Spelt -Spelt (called Dinkel in Germany) bread is a grain-bread, and is closely related to common wheat. Spelt does contain gluten. Gluten, a form of protein, is a common allergen and gluten intolerance or allergies are quite common. However some sufferers with a mild gluten tolerance do sometimes use Spelt as a substitute for wheat. <br>  <br>  6. Sourdough - Supermarket "sourdough" breads are often simply wheat bread with no sweetener added. <br>  True sourdough however is something completely different. Sourdough is a culture of lactobacilli bacteria and yeasts used to leaven bread. The culture is used as a "starter" whereby new flour and water are added. The bread has a sour or tangy flavor. Cultures can often be passed on from loaf to loaf for years. <br>  <br>  7. Cornbread -Cornbread arrived in North America long before the settlers established the first European colonies. The earliest makers of cornbread were the native tribes of the southern United States and Central America, who relied heavily upon corn as a food source. The first cornbreads were simple mixtures of cornmeal, salt and water, but many other ingredients have been added to recipes since.<br>  Cornbread is unique because it is leavened (caused to rise) chemically, instead of through the use of yeast or other leavening agents. This is due to natural properties of cornmeal and corn flour.<br>  <br>  8. Tortillas -The mainstay of the Mexican diet was, and still is, the tortilla, made from corn. The tradition continues today with little change. The kernels are cooked with lime to remove the husk and then ground on a stone slab with a grinding stone. The dough is formed into little round balls and then patted out by hand into thin round cakes or wrapped in a corn husk, the tamale, to then fill and eat. The versatility of the tortilla as a wrapper in endless. They are used for tacos and enchiladas, among native Mexicans, tortillas are commonly used as eating utensils, as a plate as in a tostada, and much more.<br>  <br>  9. Banana Bread -Banana bread (also called Banana nut bread) is a type of bread that contains mashed yellow bananas. Banana bread is usually a quick bread, a sweet, cake-like bread which typically uses baking soda as the leavening agent instead of yeast; however there are some banana bread recipes that are traditional style yeast breads.<br>  Banana bread first became a standard feature of American cookbooks with the popularization of baking soda and baking powder in the 1930s (and appears in Pillsbury's 1933 Balanced Recipes cookbook). The origin of the first banana bread recipe is unknown. The home baking revival of the 1960s and the simplicity of its recipe led to an explosion in banana bread's popularity. The cookbooks of the 1960s added to its popularity because they commonly listed multiple variations of bread that added fruits and nuts<br>  <br>  10. Brioche -<br>  Brioche à tête is perhaps the most classically recognized form. Brioche à tête rolls are panned in fluted tins with a small spherical piece of dough placed on top. During the baking process the balls of dough rise further and form an attractive pattern. The word brioche first appeared in print in 1404, and this bread is believed to have sprung from a traditional Norman recipe. It is argued that brioche is probably of a Roman origin, since a very similar sort of sweet holiday bread is made in Romania.<br>  It is often served as a pastry or as the basis of a dessert, with many local variations in added ingredients, fillings and toppings. It is also used with savory preparations, particularly with foie gras, and is used in some meat dishes.

znoU3bLhaa	Most universities accept students based on their A level Results or the equivalent of A Level results.  Where a lot of people have the same results they will look at Personal Statements as well as GCSE results to allocate places.  The better you do the more chance you have of getting accepted.  <br>  <br>  When you finish Uni etc and decide to go out to work, many future employees will also be looking at GCSE results before giving you a job.<br>  <br>  Work really hard and make your A level Results really good, have lots of extra curricular activities but remember not to have too many extra curricular activities as you want to give the impression that you value your academic career as more important than your social career.  Good luck.|`|g9v6gLe1aa	GCSEs DO matter beacuse universities will look at them. If someone has all As in their A levels and good GCSEs they will pick them over someone who hasn't done as well in GCSEs because they want a person who is consistant all round. Also jobs look for your GCSEs too.|`|YcBMWZxMaa	Unless things have changed since I was doing exams, when you apply to universities and get offers all you have is predicted grades, not actual grades. The only solid results the universities have to go off are your GCSEs, so yes they do matter. <br>  <br>  Your GCSE results sound pretty good to me though (particularly if you come from a state school rather than a private academic hothouse where even retards get all A*s) so I don't think you have much to worry about on that front

fRkX3Gfdaa	Johnson & Johnson|`|XZ4RcUHWaa	Every oil comes from a plant or organic material.|`|6JdtBWlyaa	BABIES!!!!|`|zZxX5PXBaa	Your mistake is in your starting assumption. Peanut oil is actually a synthetic compound, used to lubricate peanuts. As you may know, peanuts are not a true nut, but rather grow underground, from the roots of the plant. They used to be widely known as 'ground nuts'. Peanut farmers soak the ground with a light oil shortly before harvest, to ensure that the peanuts come up easily from the ground, without damage.<br>  <br>  The myth that olive oil comes from olives has been developed over generations by mediterranean farmers, primarily in Greece and Italy, but also in Spain. Whole groves of 'olive trees' are planted, and every year the 'olives' are carefully glued to the branches so that they can subsequently be 'harvested' and pressed for the oil. The oil does come from the olives, when they are pressed, but it is first injected into the olives, when they are prepared in factories for shipping out to the 'olive farms'. The 'olives' themselves are made from reconstituted leather fibres, and the 'olive oil' is made from recycled engine oil, to which herbal ingredients are added. It is all a huge hoax, I'm afraid, and has been done to promote mediterranean tourism. Fortunately the hoax has now taken on a life of its own, and has become more interesting than ever real olive farming could have been.<br>  <br>  Baby oil, then, just like peanut oil and olive oil, is actually a synthetic compound. The primary components are petrochemical products, although some vegetable oils are also now used.<br>  <br>  Now, whale oil ...|`|y02PZj22aa	OMG!  Does this mean that motor oil comes from motors?  And sewing machine oil comes from sewing machines?  And gun oil comes from guns?  And canola oil comes from cans?  <br>  <br>  And here I thought that "baby oil" was a petroleum derivative that was given an innocuous name so that people would buy it.  After all, "petroleum jelly" has had to put up with all sorts of disrespect because of its name, and I assumed the companies that sell the stuff were determined not to make the same mistake again.

cYfjfCb9aa	1.  To show it's a right triangle, we first find the lengths of the three sides and then demonstrate that these lengths satisfy the Pythagorean Theorem.  Then, to show the right angle is at R, we have to notice that ST is the longest side of the triangle, which in a right triangle is the hypotenuse, which then must be across from the right angle, in this case R.<br>  <br>  The length of side RS is the distance between the points.  Recall the distance formula which says:<br>  d = sqrt[ (x2-x1)^2 + (y2-y1)^2 ]<br>  <br>  So here, we have:<br>  RS = d = sqrt[ (3-1)^2 + (7-2)^2 ] = sqrt(4 + 25) = sqrt(29)<br>  <br>  By similar means, we can compute:<br>  RT = sqrt(29)<br>  ST = sqrt(58)<br>  <br>  Notice that ST is the longest side of the triangle now, as we need it to be.  Now let's see if the sides fit the Pythagorean Theorem, a^2 + b^2 = c^2.  a and b can be in any order, but c must be the hypotenuse.  Thus we have:<br>  (sqrt(29))^2 + (sqrt(29))^2 = (sqrt(58))^2<br>  <br>  If we square the square root, these all cancel, leaving us:<br>  29 + 29 = 58<br>  which is a true statement.  Thus the triangle must be a right triangle and since ST is the longest side, R must be the right angle.<br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  2.  We start with the line y = 1/2x + 5.  Notice that the slope here is always the coefficient of the x variable, in this case slope is 1/2.  If we're trying to find a line perpendicular to this one, then we know that the perpendicular slope will be the opposite and the reciprocal of the original slope.  So the opposite, reciprocal of 1/2 gives us -2/1, or just -2.  <br>  <br>  This means the slope of the new line we're finding is -2 and it goes through the point (1, -2).  From here, we use the point-slope formula:<br>  y - y1 = m(x - x1), where m=slope and (x1,y1)=a point on the graph.<br>  <br>  Thus:<br>  y - (-2) = -2(x - 1)<br>  <br>  Distributing, we have:<br>  y + 2 = -2x + 2<br>  <br>  And subtracting 2 from each side, we end up with:<br>  y = -2x<br>  which is the desired equation.<br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  3.  I'm not entirely sure what you mean with your notation here when you say mRQ and mPM.  Is that the measure of the length of the side, or the midpoint between the points, or the slope between the points?<br>  <br>  midpoint formula:  midpoint=( (x1+x2)/2 , (y1+y2)/2 )<br>  slope formula:  m = ( y2 - y1 ) / ( x2 - x1 )<br>  <br>  Now, looking at the points, you will be able to prove that the slopes of RQ and PM are opposites and reciprocals, meaning that the lines are perpendicular.  That might be what the problem is getting at.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.

Only take a humanity/Englishy one like History or English Lit if you really enjoy it, otherwise don't bother.<br>  <br>  About doing more than the standard 3 A levels and 1 AS, why not take the 4 AS ones to A level.

Do your third A level in something unrelated to science to show you are well rounded. Good examples are English Language and/or Literature, History, Geography, Philosophy, or a language.

LdHuaYLkaa	I would say 100%. The question isnt: what percentage of things in the world will kill you or melt your face if you eat them? You can eat ANYTHING. Any substance can be put into your mouth and down your throat, in varying degrees of amount, temperature, etc. Granted if you try to eat magma or liquid nitrogen, you wont get far, but you can eat it nonetheless. Some things may have to be changed slightly to accomodate, like the magma when cooled can be ground into a powder, or how you can eat an entire cow, horns and all. ;)

The top unis, like Harvard, U Michigan, UCLA, etc., will require A levels, just as British unis would. But many lower ranking unis will be fine with just GCSEs. <br>  <br>  In many cases, you'll need to take the US's SAT exam, which is their uni entrance exam. You can take that in the UK. <br>  <br>  Uni in the US is far, far, far, far more expensive than uni in the UK. By leaps and bounds, more expensive. I believe the British gov't does give a certain amount of support to British students who study overseas, so you can look into that. Some US unis will give some financial support to foreign students, and you need to ask each uni about that. But for the most part, many unis will expect you to come to the US fully capable of paying your own way. <br>  <br>  Most US unis offer accommodation - residence halls - right on campus.|`|SLnS5DAwaa	Just to add a tip to what the first guy said, you can probably get scholarships here in the US if you come from Europe or another foreign country :) I'd look into it if I were you, there's a chance you could get college paid for 100%.<br>  <br>  From now until you graduate, get the best grades possible. It'll be a lot easier to get into Uni if you have done well in school and have grades to show. Go for honors or higher classes if you have them available to you, colleges look at those with high regard :)<br>  <br>  good luck~

pYSMiNKCaa	I agree with the answer above, especially since you said that that GPA is weighted. The GPA could be supplemented with a high course load, but yours is not very demanding compared to all the other applicants who have been taking all AP or all IB courses during Junior and Senior year. <br>  <br>  I don't think you should be skipping your senior year, especially since you will have only 1 AP class in your high school history. Going to a college your senior year is probably a lot easier than going to high school, and colleges know that.<br>  <br>  But yes, Columbia and Brown are difinatly out of reach at this point. Ivy's look for a minimum GPA of 3.8, with the toughest course load that the school allows.<br>  <br>  Also, your counslor sends in a Secondary School Report, and there is a box that says "This student has taken the hardest/most demanding course load available by school cirriculum", and your counslor will not check that off.<br>  <br>  I feel like you can still get into a good school but if you have lower grades w/out AP/IB classes, your GPA will not go up when you actually start taking them.<br>  <br>  What about NYU? Look into colleges in Boston, they have a great ommunity there. Colleges in Connecticut are also worth looking into, like Connecticut College (private, very good school) and Trinity College.<br>  <br>  Yet again, Don't give up. If your SAT is very high, over 2200, then DEFINETLY apply to Brown and Columbia bceause that score plus your activities can get you in.<br>  So don't give up, raise that GPA, and hope for the best. Anything can happen.|`|rpRzeGN5aa	I don't think it will hurt you to skip your senior year--I'm not sure if it will help that much, but it might help a little.<br>  Brown and Columbia are, I think, a little out of reach.

Make sure they know the rules of mathematics:  (-) times (-) = (+);  any number divided by 0 = 0;  any number, including 0, divided by itself = 1, etc.   If the students understand the "why" of doing a problem, then they will learn the "how" easier.|`|gl4MePuDaa	mathpractice skillspack works well<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l_22gjeO-g" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l_22gjeO...</a><br>  <br>  and a good tablet pc <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26x%3D16%26ref%255F%3Dnb%255Fss%255Fgw%26y%3D23%26field-keywords%3Dlenovo%2520x61%2520tablet%2520pc%26url%3Dsearch-alias%253Delectronics&tag=tennzinshine-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=390957" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?i...</a>|`|OvrcKRQzaa	Be as elementry as u can giving him all in formation about the method and also try doing and solving every step wen u show him to solve a ques and do encourage him wen he does well!<br>  <br>  Motivation and encouragement wrks wonders!|`|lac7FBhuaa	first of all qulify D.ed. programme<br>  spend at least 2 year to learn how to teach 4th class student........|`|af533b17ca68713705564cacfb86ba98aa	1+1=11|`|bzfv8aT9aa	your question don't make sense.|`|QqY8YgGDaa	Good question<br>  -Teach using puzzel and quizs ,children are interested<br>  -You can write e mails to me

I had a couple of good years, but most of my teaching career was no fun at all.  Public school teaching is a no-respect, no-sympathy, depressing, frustrating exercise in futility with an occasional single student that is hoping to actually learn something from you.  You will be paid just enough to get by, and you will retire on about a third of that.  Your social security benefits will be cut 60% because the government thinks you have too much in your teacher pension plan (<a href="http://www.trta.com," rel="nofollow">http://www.trta.com,</a> WEP/GPO), and you will end your life as a Walmart greeter barely paying your bills.

I missed a couple job opportunities because I didnt have a college degree but that was their snobbish loss. A diploma does help to get your foot in the door but then you need to meet expectations.

kvByorJfaa	This is because, if you go towards the negatives look:<br>  <br>  -8 + (-8^2 - 16)^.5 = ALMOST -1, and it continues like this the rest of the way.<br>  <br>  So that's why it approachs -1|`|cYfjfCb9aa	The first thing we can do when we're working with the limit of an expression that includes a square root is:  multiply by the conjugate of the expression on top and bottom.  In this case, since we have x + sqrt(x^2 + 2x), we'll multiply by x - sqrt(x^2 + 2x).  Thus we have:<br>  <br>  lim.......(x + sqrt(x^2 + 2x))*(x - sqrt(x^2 + 2x))<br>  ..........----------------------------...<br>  x->-inf.............. x - sqrt(x^2 + 2x)<br>  <br>  (sorry for all the periods, yahoo answers doesn't like extra spaces)<br>  <br>  Anyway, this simplifies to:<br>  <br>  lim.............x^2 - (x^2 + 2x)<br>  ..........----------------------------...<br>  x->-inf..... x - sqrt(x^2 + 2x)<br>  <br>  which equals:<br>  <br>  lim......................-2x<br>  ..........----------------------------...<br>  x->-inf..... x - sqrt(x^2 + 2x)<br>  <br>  Now from here, notice if we try to plug in -infinity, we get positive infinity on top, and negative infinity on bottom, which means we have an indeterminate form (inf/inf).  Thus we can apply L'Hopital's Rule, giving us:<br>  <br>  lim......................-2<br>  ..........----------------------------...<br>  x->-inf..... 1 - [ (x+1) / sqrt(x^2+2x) ]<br>  <br>  (the derivative of the denominator involves the chain rule)<br>  <br>  Now, using properties of limits, we can say this:<br>  <br>  If we have the limit of  -2 / ( 1 - f(x) ), then we can make this:<br>   -2 / ( 1 - lim (f(x)) )<br>  since the other components of the expression are constants.  Now we just need the limit of (x+1) / sqrt(x^2 + 2x) as x goes to negative infinity.<br>  <br>  lim..............x + 1<br>  ..........-------------------------<br>  x->-inf....sqrt(x^2 + 2x)<br>  <br>  Now, here's the trick we have to use:  since x is approaching negative infinity, we can assume that x itself is already a negative number.  Thus, x = - sqrt(x^2).  To simplify the limit, we divide the numerator and denominator by x.  In the case of the denominator, we actually divide by -sqrt(x^2).  This gives us:<br>  <br>  lim..............1 + 1/x<br>  ..........-------------------------<br>  x->-inf....- sqrt(1 + 2/x)<br>  <br>  Now, if we plug in -inf, 1/inf and 2/inf are just 0, giving us:<br>  <br>  1 + 0<br>  --------------------<br>  - sqrt(1 + 0)<br>  <br>  which simplifies to -1.  Now if we plug this back in, we have:<br>  -2 / ( 1 - (-1) )<br>  for our original limit, which becomes -1.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.

AA10176626	Aid applicants do not get to "choose" if they are dependent or independent - your classification is established by the financial aid regulations that were established by Congress when they created the federal aid program.<br>  <br>  Financial aid dependence is NOT related to income tax dependence. These are two different uses of the same word "dependence". <br>  <br>  For financial aid purposes, it doesn't matter if you work or if you are unemployed, For financial aid purposes, it doesn't matter if you file your own taxes or you aren't required to file taxes at all. For financial aid purposes, it doesn't matter if you claim yourself, if your parents claim you, or if Donald Trump claims you.<br>  <br>  None of those things determine your financial aid dependency.<br>  <br>  Your financial aid dependency is also not determined by whether your parents give you money.

You can not change that by moving out, by getting a job, by filing taxes in any particular way, or by agreeing that your parents will no longer support you.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry for the disappointing news, but you will be required to provide your parents' financial information on your FAFSA application until you meet the criteria for a classification as an independent student for financial aid purposes.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|gfOGZtmPaa	Unfortunately, dependency for the Department of Ed is different than the IRS.

CvGEdIUiaa	Start with something they are enjoying. Speak about (ok, I'm not a mom, I have no idea what 8 year olds are in to, nowadays) the zoo. Pets. Birthday parties. Germans are pretty big on their "Namenstag", or so I've been told (my family never really celebrated it, though classmates came and congratulated me on my name day, and my cousins usually even got gifts and so on - more like a second birthday, but smaller). Read a book in German with them that they would enjoy in English. Use loads of pictures and concentrate on getting them interested in talking the language. Don't stress on the grammar that much (it's boring, they'll "shut off"), but make sure your own sentences in German are always correct! Do they have playtime? If so, play German kids songs to them while they can play. Or use German kids "H?rspielkassetten", like the three ??? (die drei ???) (which might be a little too frightening for them, considering they are only 8), "TKKG", or "Bibbi Blocksberg" (it's about a little whitch, so you have to know if that is apporpriate), "Das kleine Gespenst" (the little ghost), "Die kleine Hexe" (the small whitch - yeah, again, but this is from a different author), ... there are many many more.<br>  Books they might like are probably all the digimon, pokeymon, and so on stuff, but why not read Harry Potter with them in German (if you think that is appropriate and the paretns agree)? Or go use the German classics, like "Das fliegende Klassenzimmer", "Der kleine Mann" "Der kleine Mann und die kleine Miss", "Emil und die Detektive", "Ronja R?ubertochter", or anything from Roald Dahl? <br>  <br>  This link are normal books amazon suggests for kids age 8:<br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.de/s/ref=amb_link_71877465_9?ie=UTF8&rh=n%3A280652%2Cp_n_feature_two_browse-bin%3A486176011&pf_rd_m=A3JWKAKR8XB7XF&pf_rd_s=auto-sparkle&pf_rd_r=0YR12Y9J1VAQP9QXW9TR&pf_rd_t=301&pf_rd_p=206860991&pf_rd_i=Kinderb%C3%BCcher" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.de/s/ref=amb_link_7187...</a><br>  <br>  many, many, I don't know, though I have heard of the "Conni" ones (I'm getting teased with it - Conni is my nickname ;) )<br>  <br>  There are also many small books, more like leaflets, really, that I remember we had, but they are from so  many authors... They usually don't cost a lot and go by the name of "Pixi-books". Here#s a link to them on amazon:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.de/s/ref=nb_ss_b?__mk_de_DE=%C5M%C5Z%D5%D1&url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&field-keywords=Pixie+B%FCcher&x=0&y=0" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.de/s/ref=nb_ss_b?__mk_...</a><br>  <br>  As you see, many different subjects, themes or authors...<br>  <br>  You can also watch "Die Maus" with them from time to time( Real name: "Die Sendung mit der Maus"). Die Maus is a childrens program that starts with telling you everything they have lined up for that weeks episode in german, and than they tell you the whole thing over again in a different language, like Chinese, Croatioan, English, Frensh, or something. It's a different language every week. The show usually has a couple of mute comic strips containing the mouse, the elphant and the duck, and than it usually explains something, like how stripes get into toothpaste or how a clothes-pin is made or how bread is made or stuff like that, and than they usually have a story by "Captain Blaub?r" (puppets) and a song later on. All in all the program takes half an hour, and is absolutely the hit with kids. It's been translated into 80 languages, I think, but somehow nobody in the US has ever heard of it.<br>  There are also other /older kids programmes like "L?wenzahn" or so, but they have been discontinued because the main charakter "retired" and no one accepted the ones that wanted to take over. Sad, but true. <br>  <br>  Anyway, I hope that helped a little. All in all: Make it fun for them. Make them want to know how the story goes on, make them see that with what they have learned they are able to understand a song or a story, and they will want to go on learning. And with learning, they will get the grammar right.<br>  Good Luck! And have fun!|`|eYzuxqQaaa	OH MY GOD! You're teaching 8 year old's German?!!?!?!??

AA10176626	For next year's FAFSA (2010-2011), you and your husband will be considered a separate household, and the income and asset information that you provide will only relate to that new household.<br>  <br>  In other words - you will be considered an independent for financial aid purposes.<br>  <br>  You can qualify as an independent student for the coming school year, but ONLY if you wait and complete your application after you get married in May. You will have to check with your school's financial aid office to see if that might have a negative impact on your aid for the 2009-2010 year that begins in August or September.<br>  <br>  Good luck - I hope that helped.|`|Kwywmcs8aa	it counts from the previous taxes so yes you still have to file with parents
AA10176626	Jodi:<br>  <br>  Different programs have different requirements. You must be enrolled at least half time (6 hours) to be eligible for a Stafford loan, but the Pell Grant program will award aid to a student who is taking as few as 3 credit hours.<br>  <br>  The answer will depend on what type of aid you are receiving.<br>  <br>  There are other issues, however, and most of them are related to timing.<br>  <br>  Here's the deal:<br>  <br>  I'm going to assume that it's several weeks into your current semester at school. This means that your classes are paid for, and you are not eligible for any kind of refund. Even if you drop these two classes, the money has already been spent.<br>  <br>  Now it's a question of whose money that is.<br>  <br>  If you paid for your classes with a Stafford or Perkins loan - then that's your money. Dropping the classes won't affect your loans - they've already been disbursed - but you'll be paying for those classes anyway - over the next 10 years or so, when you begin paying your student loans back.<br>  <br>  If you paid for your classes with a Pell Grant or some other grant program, the chances are good that you're going to owe your school money if you drop these classes.<br>  <br>  A Pell Grant may be paid in the beginning of the semester, but it's not really yours until it is "earned". You earn a Pell Grant by attending class. As the semester goes along, you earn a little more of your Grant each week - and by the time the semester is 60% completed, you will have "earned" the entire grant.<br>  <br>  If you drop your classes (or stop attending) less than 60% of the way through the semester, some of your grant is said to be "unearned", and ALL unearned grant funds must be returned to the US Department of Education (where the money came from). Your school must refund the money to the Department, and they must recover that refunded amount from you.<br>  <br>  Students who owe their schools for unearned grant funds are said to have had an "overpayment", and can not receive any future financial aid until the overpayment is resolved. The student can pay the school in one lump sum, or they can arrange a payment agreement, but they must make the arrangements before next semester's aid disbursement rolls around.<br>  <br>  Students on financial aid must also pass a certain percentage of the classes that they REGISTER for. A student can not get around these rules by dropping courses - once you register for a course, it counts towards your pass percentage. Dropping a couple of courses this semester won't risk your failing the Satisfactory Academic Progress Standards, but financial aid recipients should never get into the habit of dropping classes, lest they find that they have been placed on financial aid probation.<br>  <br>  Any student who receives financial aid must consult with the financial aid department before dropping courses, especially if those courses were paid for with grant funds. Make an appointment with financial aid, and discuss what the financial ramifications of dropping these classes will be. If you can't afford to repay the school for dropping these courses, you may want to reconsider your decision.<br>  <br>  Good luck - I hope this information helped.

SIhxrxD3aa	Since the summer semester is usually only half as long as the other semesters, your classes would be meeting twice as often and you'd need to learn more material over a shorter period of time.  For that reason, 6 hours is considered full-time in the summer.  You could probably still take more than that, but you would need to check with your school and ask about the maximum credits you can take without having to pay extra.|`|XzLUA7ataa	That depends upon your college or university system.

They are told straight away that this is wrong, and even though they are special needs they understand when we are cross and their actions are wrong.<br>  <br>  Ours are young and I can't predict their future altho' I have concerns already regarding the four year olds outbursts. This eighteen year old has had a reaction, no fault of his own but he has still assaulted his carer. It is the place of work who are to blame. They should have correct methods in place to deal with violence of this nature, they should be able ,  as I am to predict the build up to these situations even when they are out of character and when they are sudden. Any member of staff attacked has to be dealt with seriously, to inform her that 'it's the job' , sorry for my language is b@llocks and she should speak to her union of the matter ASAP.|`|ORonhAuvaa	The fact that you call your students, pupils makes me think you aren't American.

I had the head teacher phone to say that she had to restrain my son and showed me how she did that (imaginary).  Her nervous tone implied that she was worried about what I would think!  My thoughts are that you have the right to defend yourself and be taught how to defend yourself.  I was mortified by my sons outburst and used signs to communicate that I was very upset by this behaviour and I made him write a letter of apology to the LSA.  Whilst I acknowledge that dealing with challenging behaviour is part of the job, you don't deserve to be hit.  I am surprised that this LSA was allowed to continue being put in such a vulnerable situation and I wonder what strategies the school had for dealing with such behaviour.  I would be inclined to look at the schools mission statement and also to see what the governers thought!<br>  <br>  My own view is that LSA's are the backbone of the classroom and my son would not be achieving what he is without this support. However, I make it a point to support the school and if he ever hits an LSA again,  I will ensure that he gets a referral to CAMHS, Children and Adolescent Mental Health Service, because without early intervention it can be a slippery slope.  I wonder what kind of support the girl had in place for dealing with her difficult behaviour?<br>  <br>  I think that you raise an very important issue and I hope that you find find an answer to your question.|`|reHRXlZCaa	Whoever told her that it was a risk of a job is a fool & if the situation is allowed to continue the school/college will be looking at the wrong end of a law suit<br>  <br>  If this child has a diagnosis of Autism with behavioural difficulties there should be a plan in place to deal with him when he lashes out, both the teacher & the support assistant should have been alerted to the fact that this child has behavioural difficulties and how to deal with him.

I hope it can help you if you live elsewhere.<br>  <br>  See if your school district has a behavior intervention specialist or an Autism Specialist. Talk to them about creating a Behavior Intervention Plan for the student. The student should be observed to see what happens right before and right after each occurance of aggressive behavior, and this should be written down.<br>  <br>  Once you've found out the function of the behavior (the what happens after part), you can create a behavior plan based on the development of a replacement behavior. Some of the most common functions for behavior are getting access to a preferred item/activity, getting attention, and getting out of doing a task.<br>  <br>  Once the function is identified, teach a replacement behavior that is easy for the student. For example, if the student engages in aggressive behavior to avoid a task, teach him to hand you a card that says, "Break" and give him a break for a few minutes.<br>  <br>  This is a really simplified explanation of the procedures that might be used. Please talk with a qualified person who works in your school system (hopefully a Board Certified Behavior Analyst - BCBA). You can find a listing of BCBAs here: <a href="http://www.bacb.com/consum_frame.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.bacb.com/consum_frame.html</a> (click on "Certificant Registry").<br>  <br>  I think that it would not be unreasonable to request some sort of crisis management training as well. <br>  <br>  Best of luck to you,<br>  <br>  Nicole Caldwell, M.Ed.<br>  <a href="http://www.PositivelyAutism.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.PositivelyAutism.com</a><br>  Autism Support and Resources

2P6WV85raa	First off, I'm glad you feel that way. You might want to focus on just one of the unfair actions taken at the time. One of the most shocking repressive tactics used against Blacks was police brutality, as you've probably seen and read about. Martin Luther King, Jr. organized demonstrations that were publicly declared non-violent, and yet the protesters were constantly attacked with dogs, fire hoses, tear gas, clubs and firearms. Even when they did not retaliate, the violence continued. Most of the trouble came from state governments, particularly in the south, who were resistant to proactively solving the problem of discrimination. The sad thing is, the federal government did very little to intervene. I think you could easily argue that a more active federal government, committed to making the changes you mentioned, would have caused a smoother transition.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

When I write poems, I like it to be about something that I can relate to, or something that I simply like. Sometimes I write about the challenges and rewards of life, and sometimes I write about the beautiful night sky and colorful sunset. To make a poem flow, I use a pattern of syllables or a good rhyming pattern. I usually just wing it, then go through it to make any corrections, deletions, or additions.

cYfjfCb9aa	Sometimes when solving trigonometric equations, it helps to think of them as if you're solving polynomials.  In this case we're able to factor the expression quite a bit.<br>  <br>  First, notice that cos^4 x - 1 = 0 is a difference of squares.  Thus it becomes:<br>  ( cos^2 x - 1 )*( cos^2 x + 1 ) = 0<br>  <br>  Then, notice again that the first factor is itself a difference of squares as well.  Factoring that, we get:<br>  ( cos x - 1 )*( cos x + 1 )*( cos^2 x + 1 ) = 0<br>  <br>  Now that it's factored, we solve each factor equal to 0 individually.<br>  <br>  cos x - 1 = 0:  this means then that cos x = 1.  This is true for x = 0.  Additionally,  it's true for x = 2π, x = 4π, x = 6π, etc. (for positive and negative values of x).  To generalize this, we can say that x = 2kπ, where k is any integer.<br>  <br>  cos x + 1 = 0:  this means then that cos x = -1.  This is true for x = π.  Additionally, it's true for x = 3π, x = 5π, etc. (again positive and negatives of these values, since cosine is an even function).  Thus we can generalize this as:  x = ( 2k+1 )π, where k is any integer.  (notice that 2k+1 always ends up an odd number, since we double whatever value we pick for k , making it even, and then add 1, making it odd)<br>  <br>  cos^2 x + 1 = 0:  this means that cos^2 x = -1, and by taking the square root of each side, we end up with cos x = +/- i, which is not a real number.  Thus we get no solutions from this factor.<br>  <br>  Now to summarize the answer.  We found that x could be any even multiple of π, and then found that x could be any odd multiple of π.  Putting these together, it means that x can be any whole number multiple of π, positive or negative.  Thus we can say:<br>  x = kπ, for any integer k.

AAbP4H9Kaa	hi, I'm a student myself and I find that it can be distracting for especially a child to be researching online. They can be distracted by chatlines, music, videos, email, games, etc. <br>  <br>  But online research does have its upsides. I find its more efficient. But looking at the library is also a source. And its more valid. <br>  <br>  Honestly, I find that when the time comes that school is more important, around the last few years of high school, if your teenager is ambitious about life and school, he or she will be more disciplined and by that age he/she will be able to take care of themselves. <br>  <br>  But for now, if your child is young, you might want to put protection against sites.

The names Yeti and Meh-Teh are commonly used by the people indigenous to the region, and are part of their history and mythology. Stories of the Yeti first emerged as a facet of Western popular culture in the 19th century.<br>  <br>  The scientific community largely regards the Yeti as a legend, given the lack of evidence, yet it remains one of the most famous creatures of cryptozoology. The Yeti can be considered a parallel to the Bigfoot legend of North America.<br>  <br>  In 1832, James Prinsep's Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal published trekker B. H. Hodgson's account of his experiences in northern Nepal. His local guides spotted a tall, bipedal creature covered with long dark hair, which seemed to flee in fear. Hodgson did not see the creature, but concluded it was an orangutan.<br>  <br>  An early record of reported footprints appeared in 1889 in Laurence Waddell's Among the Himalayas. Waddell reported his guide's description of a large apelike creature that left the prints, which Waddell concluded were actually made by a bear. Waddell heard stories of bipedal, apelike creatures, but wrote that of the many witnesses he questioned, none "could ever give ... an authentic case.

AA11735935	1.  The opportunity cost is the time difference in having the book.  Lisa can buy it now or get it tomorrow at the earliest or in 7 days at the latest.<br>  2.  The only relevant choices are 1) the $65 bookstore book, and 2) the $55 book $3.99 shipping.  There is only $1 difference between the $55 book plu $8.98 and the $65 bookstore book, making it not worth the opportunity cost.  The other online options will cost more than the bookstore book.<br>  3.  It comes down to what it more important to the student: having the book now or saving six dollars.|`|777KkAScaa	675|`|4pXDJqWeaa	a.  The opportunity cost of buying online would be the wait time for the shipping, the amount of money it costs in respects to what that money could be used for and the time it takes to make the money to pay for shipping.  Each of these things could have another outcome with the time/money involved.<br>  <br>  b.  The student has the choice of buying the book in person for $65, buying the book online at the first store for $55 plus either the standard shipping or 2 business day shipping time depending on wait time.  The other store and the 1 day shipping can be excluded because the student can buy the books cheaper elsewhere.<br>  <br>  c.  The main determinate of which option the student will use is based on the amount of time the student is willing to go without the book.  If the student needs the book within two days the student will buy the book in person.  If the student needs the book in between 2 and 3 days the student would go with the first online store with the 2 business day shipping.  If the student is in no rush and has more than 7 days before the book is needed the student will go with the first online store with the standard shipping.  If the student needs the book between 3 and 6 days the student would most likely buy from the first online store with the 2 business day shipping.

That way, if I was to talk, the teacher would see my gum and I would get in trouble.<br>  <br>  If that doesn't apply to you, then ask the teacher to move you around the classroom.

AA10988215	I think if there are a few students in her group that are all unhappy you should maybe consider submitting a joint complaint about her.  If the O.U offices are not getting back to you promptly then contact them again-these things are often not resolved because students don't hurry it along so the staff start thinking you're not too bothered by her after all.  <br>  <br>  In my first year with the O.U I had a tutor who wasn't very good.  She stated email was her preferred method of contact and then took at least a week to reply to any.  I emailed with a query about a TMA once and she got back to me 3 days after I posted the TMA to her, even though she must have received it by then!  She also completely failed to turn up for a tutorial one month.  I found her to be a very harsh marker too.  I got my worst scores from her out of all the courses I did for my degree.  I think I proved she was a harsh marker when my exam grade was about 7% higher than my overall TMA grade-something which is pretty unheard of!  I wish now that I had done more to complain about her conduct.  Although she was a one off-all of my other tutors were excellent.<br>  <br>  Also in the same year as I had the above tutor, a tutor for another course I was on broke her leg whilst skiing and we very quickly were assigned a new tutor to mark our TMA's etc so the O.U could probably very quickly find you another tutor if you felt you could not have your current one any longer.<br>  <br>  In the meantime, I think you should maybe look for help regarding your TMA on the Firstclass Forums-you can usually get some excellent advice from other students and some tutors often frequent the forums too.  Keep on complaining to the O.U offices too-you are paying for your course and deserve a tutor who can help you promptly and efficiently.<br>  <br>  Hope you get it sorted soon. :-)|`|X8fwBpsyaa	Just keep complaining, things can be a little slow, but the OU is usually pretty good about these things. If you have questions and just can't face asking your tutor, try asking other students. Do you use the firstclass forum? If so you might be able to ask people from other tutor groups as well. <br>  <br>  If the only person who can answer your question  is your tutor just bite the bullet and email her. Try and ignore the rudeness. <br>  <br>  Don't worry too much, the first TMA is usually weighted less than later ones, so if you don't do as well it's not too much of a problem (and they'll automatically apply a substitute score if it's your lowest mark). <br>  <br>  Keep trying to talk to your regional office, they tend to be run off their feet though, so you may need to be patient..|`|gmmGchcuaa	Keep complaining. I had a really s h i t French teacher when I was at school and complained to get moved to a different class.

82a4bd999404bced3be0ccff2c393a40aa	I pulled the following from Career Owl, which helped me write my resume the first time:<br>  <br>  <br>  A career objective is best used to focus a resume when you know what position you are interested in. This section appears at the beginning of a resume after the name and contact information. If you are sending your resume to a company in the hopes of landing any job, a qualifications summary would be better for you. It's a good idea to have one or the other, before leaping into the heart of your resume.<br>  <br>  The purpose of a career objective is to tell the employer what it is that you want to do. The rest of the resume focuses on supporting this objective and convincing the employer of your ability to do it. If you do decide to use an objective, do not use vague words and phrases. They will not add value to your application. Do not write: "To obtain a position in a progressive company where I can use my skills to increase sales and contribute to the overall success of the organization". Rather, be specific in outlining exactly what you are looking for: "To direct a sales organization at a consumer products company."<br>  <br>  Keep your objective focused and precise. As a guide, make it 12 words or less; don't go over this limit unless you feel it will really help you land your job. Ensure that the rest of your resume supports your objective. After you have it written, ask yourself:<br>  <br>  * Does my objective position me as a qualified candidate for the position I am seeking?<br>  * Does it emphasize the contribution I can make to the organization?<br>  * Does it entice the employer to read the rest of my application?<br>  <br>  Remember that if you do use an objective in your resume, be sure to adjust your resume for the different types of jobs that you apply for.<br>  <br>  Objective Examples<br>  <br>  Seeking a position in sales where five years of customer service experience will add value.<br>  <br>  Position where three years of management experience will contribute.<br>  <br>  Corporate trainer, where a thorough understanding of English will be useful.

trKgx3Ukaa	The following is from the Department of Labor.<br>  <br>  Median annual earnings of physical therapist assistants were $41,360 in May 2006.

The lowest 10 percent earned less than $26,190, and the highest 10 percent earned more than $57,220.<br>  <br>  It is the median value that is the best indicator. Therefore you can expect to earn around $41,360<br>  <br>  Most physical therapist aides are trained on the job, but many physical therapist assistants earn an associate degree from an accredited physical therapist assistant program.

WETYSQcfaa	Schools are boring because they just try to make us literate and to make sure we know facts. They don't try to make us more rational and responsible. Only blaming the teachers would be unfair because the fault is of the whole education system and policies. They are just not student friendly. I think we should have more involvement of students in the class. There should be much more activity base teaching. Also, students should get more field knowledge like going for a trip to zoo for zoology class or Museum trip for history class so they understand the facts much better and put them in use. Also, teacher should try to grab attention of students and make their subject more interesting and provoke thoughts in student's mind and let him/her shape it through their imagination.|`|zh9Jjddvaa	I blame the students for not having enough motivation to take the information that is offered and to turn it into something|`|lg9ahADIaa	i blame the teacher they are all so dull and the classrooms are dull as well|`|6h0eCVwpaa	tell me about it....sometimes i fall asleep in class and then someone wakes me up xD It's mostly the teachers' fault.

Zw5nn7cNaa	It's really sweet to write a poem for a girl, and if she's a non-literary person who knows little/cares little for poetry, she will appreciate this. <br>  A poem is a great way to show someone you care, but honestly, this poem is full of cliches and wouldn't keep a reader besides her. <br>  <br>  References to things like hearts, smiles, arms, love, blue, etc. are dull, unpersonal, and make this poem sound like so many others that have gone the way of the trash can.<br>  <br>  Try to think of it this way - What makes you think of her? What do you like about her? What are the "little things" that make her unique? What do you do together, what color is her hair? (For example not "brown," but maybe "chestnut") A poem that will really capture her heart is about HER, not one that you could reuse on someone else. Makes sense? You don't have to write her a literary gem for her to appreciate it, but put YOU into it and HER. For example, if she's a dancer, wright about her ballet shoes, the long practice hours and how you miss her during them (and not just "I miss you" but "I miss the way you _____"), her hair pulled back in a bun, the way she moves her leg on stage . Also, rhyming is overrated and is best avoided unless you can do it without sounding sing songy. Good luck, if your heard is in it, she will love it!<br>  <br>  EDIT: Despite what the person above me said, I like that she's the greatest girl you'll ever meet, as it implies she's the best there is, rather than the best you've come across thus far.|`|shvhgzXeaa	She will love it.|`|bCgW89MLaa	Honestly, I could really get through it all...  but I'm sure it's great if that's the kind of mushy relationship you have with Bonny...<br>  <br>  I just wanted to comment that on the first line it should read "to the greatest girl I've ever met"  <br>  Unless of course you are some kind of stalker who hasn't even met Bonny yet, it should be in past tense.

cL0aHkYEaa	The verb you are looking for is "sonner"...<br>  So, "Toutes les bandes sonnent le même."|`|52ff51d6137df3c2b3735955d8cdc61eaa	Toutes les troupes sonnent le meme.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure if it is "la troupe" (feminine) or "le troupe" (masculine) ... but I think I have translated correctly.|`|cWEd4ALUaa	You can say" toutes les groups de music son parreil" or " toutes les groups de music on l'air parreil" or toutes les groups de music son comparable". Sound cannot really be translated in the way that you are trying to use it in your sentence. The first sentence says " all of the bands are the same", the second says" all of the bands look the same" here look means sound like and the third sentence says" all of the bands are comparable". I hope this helped you.
cL0aHkYEaa	I think that the book is still in print, so it is unlikely you'll find a pdf format online--I couldn't find one, anyway. The link in the previous response gives course information, student prospectus or syllabus, bibliographies, etc.--it's not the book.<br>  <br>  But it is available at abe books for $4.50--you probably could get overnight shipping.<br>  <a href="http://www.abebooks.com/servlet/ListingDetails?bi=1012156864&cm_mmc=gbase-_-us-_-gbase-_-1012156864" rel="nofollow">http://www.abebooks.com/servlet/ListingD...</a><br>  <br>  Other vendors:<br>  <a href="http://www.google.com/products/catalog?hl=en&q=An+Introduction+to+Formal+Languages+and+Automata&um=1&ie=UTF-8&cid=10918882127587092652#ps-sellers" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/products/catalog?h...</a>|`|AA11735935	<a href="http://www.pdf-search-engine.com/an-introduction-to-formal-languages-and-automata-pdf.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.pdf-search-engine.com/an-intr...</a>

AA10176626	Your friend's parents do not need to be US citizens for her to qualify for financial aid - only the applicant has to be a US citizen.<br>  <br>  As the other respondents have explained, a dependent financial aid applicant must provide information on her parents' income and assets. The entire point of the application is to determine the financial ability of the student and the parents to pay for school.<br>  <br>  The financial aid system expects a student's parents to be just as responsible for their educational expenses, even if they live in a foreign country, or they are not US citizens - so the information is just as necessary. <br>  <br>  If your friend's parents lived and worked in the US, she will need to report the income that her parents earned from work and their "adjusted gross income" as reported on their federal tax returns, exactly as if they were American citizens or permanent residents.<br>  <br>  If your friend's parents worked in another country, and they paid foreign taxes, the instructions say:<br>  <br>  "If the student or parents filed a tax return using something other than a common IRS form, such as a foreign or Puerto Rican tax form, the student should report on the FAFSA the amounts (converted to U.S. dollars) from the lines of the form that correspond most closely to those on the common IRS forms."<br>  <br>  If your friend's parents worked in this country illegally, or didn't pay taxes for some other reason, there is a potential problem. Starting this past year, the Department of Education is required to automatically reject a FAFSA form if a non-filer's work income is above the IRS tax filing threshold.  That's an unfortunate issue, that I can not help you with.<br>  <br>  Finally, if the issue is simply that your friend's parents don't have a Social Security Number, the FAFSA instructions explain that she should simply enter 000-00-0000 for Questions 63 and 67.<br>  <br>  I hope that helps. Good luck to you and your friend!|`|7ae938d47fa5ab107ff81fe42738c6a4aa	If she is an undergraduate student, under 24 years of age and does not answer yes to any of the FAFSA questions that can make her independent, then she needs to include her family's information on the FAFSA.  She should contact the Financial Aid Office of the college that she attends or will be attending for further guidance.|`|dqtcXOZwaa	Yes, it matters a lot.  If you are under 23, you are considered a dependent and must report your parents income, even if you have not talked to them in five years.|`|Kwywmcs8aa	Doesn't matter if they don't have a valid social security number you just fill it up with 000000000 if they don't have one.  Tax Identification Numbers (TIN) will void your application.
ahjqc9Ifaa	Each college establishes its own rules about whether dorm rooms can be shared by opposite-sex students. Most often if they're under 21, the parents have to sign off on it.<br>  <br>  However, I strongly advise against sharing with a romantic partner. If something goes wrong with the relationship, your living arrangements are also in upheaval, so you don't even have a place to go to lick your wounds or rant.<br>  <br>  Edit: Our son had a female roommate one year, not his girlfriend, and it worked out very well. He attended Bard College in New York.|`|qkJTx9OXaa	As mentioned before, it really depends on your school and probably depends on in which state your school resides. However, I have not heard of a school that allows this unless the couple is married. I would assume that most schools shy away from this because of the liability involved. I would also assume that they don't want to have to constantly deal with changing room assignments every time a couple breaks up.<br>  <br>  Probably the only way you could officially get away with it would be if you and your girlfriend were married. I suppose homosexual couples would also be able to get around this.|`|578dbe2353b19bc69963b9570c3e5043aa	Only if it is a co-ed dorm.  This will vary from campus to campus.<br>  <br>  It would be advised for you and your girlfriend to have separate dorms on campus.<br>  Take the oppurtunity to be away from home and on your own.  And at the same time, still have somewhere private you can go for the occassional night from your girl-friend (same would apply to her.)|`|Ho3lRmDMaa	Some campus allow coed roommates. Check with your school. But something tells me that wouldn't fly with either of your parents.|`|RM9I8hwTaa	no.|`|02d511db649335d2adefb43b06d507d3aa	No. Opposite sexes cannot share a dorm room.

olopisx7aa	1. There can be after school groups to keep kids busy with stuff like sports, socializing, activities, so they aren't in gang activity.<br>  <br>  2. Teens can have mentors. Have volunteer (or paid) mentors to discourage them from joining gangs and encouraging them to do more positive things. This will help the kids who don't have strong family support.<br>  <br>  About Canada tho, I know nothing about Canada.|`|c33f93f696894c8738c813fbfef4bc3daa	being in a gang has become glorified, the governement will need to find a way around this. <br>  The governement should target areas with high gang activity and try to offer other forms of acceptance for the younger people such as sports and other activities for the kids. Try to show the younger people of the area that they are worth more by giving them a sense of identity larger and more respected that the identity of the gang
