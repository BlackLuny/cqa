This is a chance of 1 in a number with 57,800 zeros. It would take 11 full pages of magazine type to print this number. To try to put this in perspective, there are about 10^80 (a number with 80 zeros) electrons in the universe.

TBVrxEv7aa	The driving force behind the process of plate tectonics is heat generated deep inside the earth’s core by radioactive decay. The heat generated wants to escape. It finds weak zone to escape at the junction of two plates in the ocean which came to be known as mid-oceanic ridges. Here two plates are pulling apart from each other as hot magma (liquid rock) emerges from the mantle and oozes forth as lava to fill the crack continuously created by plate separation. The lava cools and attaches itself to the trailing edge of each plate giving rise to the ridge forming new ocean floor crust ( new land ) in a process commonly known as sea-floor spreading.|`|SBBnWsJJaa	Because this is an area where oceanic plates are being created by volcanism, it is hotter.  This heat makes the plates right there less dense, causing them to be higher than the cooler parts of the plate farther away.

On the fourth side, put one lone pair of electrons so that your C would also have eight electrons surrounding it (or 3 single bonds and one lone pair of electrons). ^^

AA11513203	An interesting question.<br>  <br>  Newborn human babies, of course, are a bit more helpless than most newborn mammals.    The best explanation for this is that the evolution of the *massive* human brain (compared to all other mammals, even other primates that already have a bigger brain than other mammals) requires human babies to be born while still small enough for their head to fit through the female pelvic bone.   As a result, the human nervous system is still "under construction" in a newborn, and thus they can't do much by way of coordinated movement just after birth.<br>  <br>  This changes rapidly however, and within a few months, a human infant, going into toddler years, actually does appear to have an innate ability to "swim" (stay afloat) without instruction.   <br>  <br>  But the interesting thing is that this innate ability to swim seems to disappear as the infant learns to *walk*.   And the more the child grows to adolescence and then adulthood without ever learning to swim, the harder it gets.   <br>  <br>  Here's my explanation (and this is just my own thinking off the top of my head, so take it with a grain of salt):<br>  <br>  Once a human has learned to walk upright, that upright posture feels "natural".   But in water, the body naturally tends to float horizontally (think of the "dead-man's float").   A horizontal position *feels* completely "unnatural" to an adult very used to standing upright, as our necks are not used to lifting the head up.  The natural floating position our body does tens to push our face downward, and the human trying simultaneously to keep the head up, and the body upright.   But it takes a bit of coordination to tread water in an upright position ... i.e. to fight our body's natural tendency to float horizontally.   So we flounder ... actually *fighting* our natural tendency to float ... panic sets in, and the situation gets worse.  If we swallow water, or (worse) breathe water, then our bodies get heavier and our natural ability to float is even further reduced.<br>  <br>  Most other mammals, however, do not walk upright.   They are already more comfortable in a horizontal position with their heads held up so they can see.   So in water, their bodies and heads are already in a position naturally conducive to floating.   So treading water, for a quadruped, is much easier to learn.  So just staying afloat is much easier for a natural quadruped (like other mammals, or an infant human) than for a natural biped (like an adult human) ... and all that's left to learn is how to move through the water.<br>  <br>  Again, take that with a grain of salt ... that was just off-the-top-of-my-head thinking.

Gnfc4wRlaa	Asteroid 99942 Apophis is being watched for a possible impact in 2036 (1 in 45,000). An impact alert had been issued for possible impact in 2029, but additional observations showed it wouldn't hit us in 2029 and the alert was canceled. The probability for a 2029 impact had been 1 in 37 at one point before the additional observations were added.  The potential Apophis impact though is not a global killer. Apophis is about 300 meters in size, which would cause regional devastation if it hit.  Mitigation scenarios are being looked at for Apophis in case it becomes necessary.  They do need to know years ahead of time in order to plan and carry out a mission to the asteroid and to actually deflect it enough.<br>  <br>  "The exact effects of any impact would vary based on the asteroid's composition, and the location and angle of impact. Any impact would be extremely detrimental to an area of thousands of square kilometres, but would be unlikely to have long-lasting global effects, such as the initiation of an impact winter.<br>  <br>  Scenarios for Dealing with Apophis, a paper presented by Donald B. Gennery at the 2007 Planetary Defense Conference held in Washington, DC, outlines a number of proposals for deflecting Apophis including gravitational tractor, kinetic impact, and nuclear bomb methods." Another mitigation proposal is to place a reflective mesh covering on the asteroid to cause the orbit to change over a number of years.<br>  <br>  2008 January 30 <br>  "Asteroid 2007 TU24 passed by the Earth yesterday, posing no danger. The space rock, estimated to be about 250 meters across, coasted by just outside the orbit of Earth's Moon. The passing was not very unusual -- small rocks strike Earth daily, and in 2003 a rock the size of a bus passed inside the orbit of the Moon, being detected only after passing. TU24 was notable partly because it was so large. Were TU24 to have struck land, it might have caused a magnitude seven earthquake and left a city-sized crater. A perhaps larger danger would have occurred were TU24 to have struck the ocean and raised a large tsunami."|`|e0227973f38e13ea78ebdb8fcda760efaa	Depends when.

This relies on us being able to build it (or adapt an existing one for attachment), launch it, rendezvous with the body and attach it.<br>  <br>  Most likely if a threat is found, several such motors will be launched in case of failure.  Few budget-watching politicians would complain at the cost, methinks!<br>  <br>  Most of the bodies that would be a potential threat are large enough to be detected a long way off, or small enough where a smaller and easier motor solution could be used.<br>  <br>  The danger would be the small ones that come out of nowhere at high velocity, perhaps the result of a close encounter further out.  That would be a challenge unless we had something ready to go...|`|M6VbRL7Kaa	if we saw it in time yeah, all we would have to do is put a booster that would slowly push it into an orbit which would not hit Earth, we have the technology it is just a matter of planning ahead|`|xOX7yMczaa	yourescaringmestopit!|`|Vi8RDbhUaa	No|`|zKmlqPIVaa	When you think of the term "asteroid" you are probably thinking of the belt between the inner and outer planets.  you may think that there are a lot of big rocks in there, but in reality, the entire mass of the asteroid belt is only 2-3% of the mass of the moon!  not only that, 75% of that mass is divided between 4 asteroids.  So, just because we are close to the asteroid belt, it doesn't mean that the asteroids are GOING to hit us that hard.  Earth is a small target to hit.<br>  however, if an asteroid does hit us, (a big one) it will kill at least a billion people.  How do we stop it?<br>  retro rockets.<br>  what are these rockets?<br>  basically, if we find that an asteroid, a big one, is going to hit us 200 years from now, we send these rockets.  Then, once they near the asteroid, they slow down, and pull it by a few hundredths of a degree using gravity.  They do this by using propulsion to push themselves farther apart, while gravity, the force of attraction, pulls the rocket towards the comet, but also,<br>  the comet towards the rocket.<br>  this few hundredths of a degree can make the comet totally miss Earth.

Hence, following the step you're reached, if you subtract RR2 from both sides you get R1R2-RR2 = RR1. If you factor out R2 from the left side you get R2(R1-R) = RR1. Divide by the quantity (R1-R) and you're left with R2 = RR1/(R1-R).

These nutrients encourage the growth of algae. When the sun is out photosynthesis releases oxygen to the water. However, the algae blocks the light penetrating the water, preventing the growth of other plants and also discouraging animals. Also when it gets dark the oxygen in the water is consumed  by respiration of the algae and you can end up with anaerobic conditions. When the algae dies it drops to the bed of the river or lake and as it decomposes it takes up more oxygen and releases further nutrients. The end result, if allowed to continue, is the complete death of all life other than algae in the water environment and all of this because nutrients were allowed to enter the water.|`|5h0nUQODaa	at most brief.. it's when water becomes polluted.. causing algae to grow.. blocking out the sunlight and taking oxygen.. plans die.. fish starve.. etc|`|BnntCVOuaa	Eutrophication is when water is polluted causing it to become filled with algae, this can also contribute to Global warming<br>  x

This energy consumption will ultimately lead to net increase of entropy in the form of heat energy.<br>  <br>  <br>  Read up on Entropy and the Second Law of Thermodynamics as this may help your understanding<br>  <br>  Heat energy exchange is only one way from an object or area of greater heat to an object or area of lower heat. ie. ice does have heat energy but it could not pass this energy off to something warmer like a body of water. instead the warmer bodies energy would be transfered to the ice. Its a one way street.|`|oaeD5B1taa	It is strictly so because of definition....entropy is DEFINED as dQ/ T for any thermodynamic system. It can actually be less than zero or negative in some cases but that will always be counterbalanced by a larger positive value of entropy somewhere else in the universe and most always right nearby where the decrease was found. Try to imagine a cyclic process such as the diesel cycle or Carnot cycle...if the process were perfectly reversible (i.e. no increase whatsoever in the randomness of molecular motion) the integral of entropy around the entire path on a pressure versus volume (P-V) diagram would be exactly ZERO....but since in real nature there is always an increase in randomness, the integral will always be some value greater than zero or positive<br>  <br>  The expression for entropy, dS = dQ/T is a measure of the increase or decrease of randomness of the universe or the more chaotic motion of the atoms and molecules whereof it is composed...any decrease in entropy in one part of the universe (such as in refrigeration) will always be counter-responded to by a larger INcrease somewhere else (in the refrigeration pump and motor) so that the net effect is always a net INcrease in entropy...Now consider two physical systems, one, A, at a higher temperature than the other, B. The 2nd Law of Thermodynamics tells us that heat will always flow from the warmer A to the colder B. Now if this amount of heat (calories, BTUs, ergs, whatever) is given by dQ, then the decrease in entropy of A is -dQ/T(A)<br>  while the INcrease in entropy of B is +dQ/T(B) and because T(A) > T(B) then if you add the two together the result will always be >0. This is all they are saying. I hope this helps ---I am not sure I fully understood your question.|`|SYZQZGesaa	The answer is simple. The "universe" or empty space is cold.

c3988adee76bb2df1e09bf7fdb3893bbaa	It sounds like you have a cylindrical pool with diameter = 15 feet and depth = 52 inches = 4 1/3 feet. If so, then:<br>  Volume = pi * 15^2/4 * 4 1/3 = 776 ft^3<br>  <br>  So gallons of water = 776 *7.5 = 5,820 <-- Answer|`|VA2ZiTlgaa	Gallons are volume.  In other words they need 3 dimensions, you only gave two.  Two can give you an area, but not a volume.  Get the width, the length, and the depth in feet.  Multiply all three together and you'll have the volume of your pool in cubic feet.  Find out how many cubic feet are in one gallon of water (online or in a book).  Divide the volume of your pool in cubic feet by the number of cubic feet in one gallon and the answer is the number of gallons needed to fill your pool.

CH2::CHCH2Cl lacks any carbon atoms which have 4 different groups. Even CH2::CClCH3 would not be chiral because of the double bond.

But I think all predators are dangerous and their structures and adaptations are specialized for specific organisms only. Meaning, their is no " MOST DANGEROUS."

But they kill more people each year than any other animal in the world. Not because they kill and then eat other animals, but because they are highly territorial, and if you are attacked by a hippo, your chances of survival are next to none.<br>  <br>  If you want the most successful predator. Then it is the African hunting dog. They have the highest hunting success rate in the entire animal kingdom, with over 80% of all hunts ending in a kill. For most other predators, it is quite significantly less than that.<br>  <br>  Then again there are many other arguments for other predators. Such as the komodo dragon, which only needs one bite to kill something (saliva causes blood poisoning which kills over the course of several days). Or hyenas, which have enough power in their jaws to bite through a skull. Or the shark, which is a particularly well designed animal.<br>  <br>  So it really depends on what you want to base the most dangerous judgment on. The animal which kills the most people, the animal that has a greater chance of killing other animals, or the animal that just seems to you to be the most dangerous. As all predators are dangerous in their own rights in various ways, there is no sure fire way to give a completely straight answer.|`|1zxFh0Ibaa	Mankind.|`|e83528dfdef116888f685ef4cbea343aaa	Man|`|nhvVhsixaa	look in a mirror
6uo0NbUgaa	Gravity:<br>  The acceleration due to gravity is 9.81 m/s2.  All objects will fall to the earth at this rate when neglecting air resistance and there is no other force(s) acting on the object.  This specifically helps for Newton's laws because you know the acceleration of the object in free fall and can use this to find the Force or Mass of the object.<br>  <br>  Inertia:<br>  An object in motion tends to stay in motion unless acted on by an outside force.  This helps with the following:  the turning of a car, the force required to stop an object or to change its direction, calculating the velocity of an object in the X or Y direction.<br>  <br>  Newton's Laws:<br>  F=Ma is particularly important for an enormous array of problems.  It is particularly helpful for objects colliding or when you know that the total sum of the forces on an object = 0 (like when an object is at rest or moving with constant velocity.  You can sum the forces in all directions and set them equal to 0 to find a missing force (like friction for example.)  It is also very helpful to find the mass or acceleration of an object if you know the force applied to it.

The rest of the mammals break down into cetaceans (whales & kin), carnivores (lions and tigers and bears - OH MY), bats, insectavores, sloths and anteaters. Insectavores are the most ancient group of mammals. The cetaceans are the youngest.

Things that cancel are (a-b)'s, (a-2b)'s, and (a+b)'s (note: there are two (a+b)'s on the bottom but only one (a+b) on top, so you will have an (a+b) left over on the bottom).<br>  <br>  The answer is 3 / (a+b).<br>  <br>  <br>   x(x - y^2/x) divided by (1/y - 1/x)<br>  <br>  First off, the x needs to get distribute in  x(x - y^2/x).  This gives you x^2 - y^2.  So the problem is really (x^2 - y^2) / (1/y - 1/x).<br>  <br>  If you ever have fractions inside a fraction (like you do here), it's a good idea to multiply both sides of the big fraction by the LCD of the little fractions.  the LCD of 1/y and 1/x is xy, so multiply both sides of (x^2 - y^2) / (1/y - 1/x) by xy.  It looks like this:<br>  <br>  (x^2 - y^2) xy<br>  ------------------<br>  (1/y - 1/x) xy<br>  <br>  Distribute the xy on the bottom (but not the top) to get this:<br>  <br>  (x^2 - y^2) xy<br>  ----------------------<br>  (1/y) xy - (1/x) xy<br>  <br>  As a consequence of this, you can now cancel the little fractions on the bottom to get this:<br>  <br>  (x^2 - y^2) xy<br>  ------------------<br>  x - y<br>  <br>  Know why I didn't distribute the xy on the top?  Because I was looking ahead.  I saw the x - y about to show up on the bottom.  the x^2 - y^2 on the top will factor intto (x-y)(x+y), thus giving me factors of (x-y) to cancel.  Had I distributed the xy across the x^2 - y^2 on the top, I might have missed this.<br>  <br>  So, factor the top to get this:<br>  (x-y)(x+y) xy<br>  ---------------<br>  x - y<br>  <br>  Cancel the (x-y)'s tog et your final answer of (x+y)xy, or xy(x+y), or even x^2y + xy^2.

kKTCCFsEaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  What a great lab you have, that was a great experiment on diffusion and osmosis I`m sure you understand the concept and just need a little push to tie it all. <br>  <br>  So here goes,<br>  First of all you have to understand the concept of diffusion and osmosis.<br>  Diffusion basically the movement of solute from the environment with high concentration solute to low concentration of solute. Same goes for osmosis which is basically diffusion of water.<br>  The second thing is to know the use of Lugol. Lugol (Iodine) detects the presence of starch (i`m guess it detects the bond between the sugar monomers) by turning from brown to blue-ish color. <br>  And finally the use of dialysis tube which is a selective permeable membrane (as the name suggested, it selectively allows substrate to pass through the membrane. In this case the limitation is size, small molecules can pass but not the big ones). In this case you`ll observe that it would let small molecules such as water, Lugol, and glucose to pass through but not starch (its too long and big).<br>  so ... here goes the answers ... Keep in mind this procedure basically deals with DIFFUSION, I`m guessing that you would have another lab dealing with osmosis (such as the capillary tube which have its water level rising or something like that)<br>   <br>  1. What goes in the tube? the Lugol ... the evidence is the starch bag turns blue since the lugol reacts with the starch. The reason is diffusion. The concentration of Lugol outside the bag is higher than of the inside of the bag thus Lugol would go inside both of the bag since there is no lugol inside the bag. You can test the presence of Lugol in the glucose tube just to make sure.<br>  <br>  2. What goes outside the tube? the glucose but not the starch. The reason is the same the concentration of glucose inside the bag is higher than the beaker and thus the glucose would leak out of the bag and into the beaker until they reach equilibrium (concentration of glucose in the bag = in the beaker). The evidence is the 1/2 concentration of glucose in the beaker. <br>  <br>  Notes,<br>  The starch is not leaking ... because it is too big and cannot pass the bag (the selective permeable membrane).<br>  The decreasingly less brown dilution of lugol in the beaker might have come from the glucose coming out of the bag and into the beaker and thus diluting the brown-ness. This might also come from the water coming out of the bag and into the beaker (via osmosis as the concentration of solute in  beaker [lugol] is higher than concentration of solute [glucose/starch] in bag, however it is highly unlikely.<br>  the tubes with 5 ml starch will just sediments so don`t worry this serve as control to compare the blue-ness in the bag. Obviously diffusion takes time and not an instantaneous effect (imagine recess with only 2 small doors). The lugol also serve as a control for comparison, also test tubes (at least all test tubes that i know) are not permeable at all thus not allowing any molecule movement, the evidence is that your starch in test tube was not turning blue.<br>  <br>  So ... there you have it ...<br>  I hope that helps ...<br>  <br>  Cheers,<br>  Eugene K

This is part of the 'Hydrological (Water) Cycle' of the Earth. The only problem with it is, that, as rain falls, it absorbs pollutants like Carbon particles (soot) and Dust,  also Acid Gases from the atmosphere which produce the 'Acid Rain' we hear so much about.<br>  The amount of water vapour in the air depends on the Zonal Atmospheric Pressure and Temperature. Low pressure, high Temperature Air will hold more water vapour.|`|51e7baee76cfe5758f817c35c038f4c7aa	Yes, a greenhouse gas retains the heat from the sun's rays in the same way glass does in a greenhouse.<br>  <br>  Not sure on the percentage of the atmosphere it is, but it is significant.|`|gOD5NNzCaa	Yes it is present in the atmosphere at a level of about 3-4%.  It has been estimated that the mean temperature of the earth's surface would be close to freezing were it not for the greenhouse effect of atmospheric water vapour.

EN32vSsCaa	There are 3 systems of weights and measures used in Pharmacy.  Metric is standard.  The Apothecary system is a historical system, and the Avoirdupois system is the common system that the US uses where 1 pound = 16 ounces.  With the Apothecarie's system of measures, 1 grain = 65mg.  The Avoirdupois system of measures, 1 grain = 60mg.<br>  In this case, the Apothecary system is used where 1gr = 65mg.  5gr x 65mg/gr = 325mg.  So the answer is 1 tablet q4h.

pDUuZAnGaa	The bonds are relatively the same. This is somewhat of an ambiguous question though. The DNA of any species is composed of the same nitrogenous bases: adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine. <br>  <br>  The backbone of DNA is formed by phosphodiester bonds between the phosphate and deoxyribose sugar attached to each base.<br>  <br>  The double stranded structure is formed by hydrogen bonding between the nitrogenous bases across the individual strands of DNA. Besides the covalent bonding within the base itself, this hydrogen bonding is really the only other force at work between the nitrogenous bonds themselves.
8y72SEoLaa	The above is all correct. <br>  Heart cells I'm pretty sure are replaced by new ones. <br>  <br>  I think the most important thing that makes the heart different is that it is the only muscle which does not require any other muscle to move (pump) and does not require a skeletal structure to keep it in on your body.<br>  The fact that your heart is the only muscle that is constantly moving makes it important too. (except for your brain, which isn't really a muscle)|`|pDUuZAnGaa	Well, one major difference is that the heart isn't attached to any bones. It has a net of fibers formed around itself that contract to squeeze the blood. On the other hand, skeletal muscles are attached to bone.|`|23hPHjOqaa	Other than the fact that it is a pump etc... etc... the main difference is that it is myogenic, which means that the cells depolarise and repolarise by themselves, therefore the heart beats automatically even when removed from the body if not damaged it will continue to beat, however the beating will not be controlled as their will be no vagus nerve input.
4c54zUjuaa	Genetic variation is simply the sum total of all the gene alleles in a population or species. A good example might be height in humans. There is a wide range of possible gene combinations that effect how tall you are. You can look around you and see the variation in the population. Evolution by natural selection then acts upon the variation that is present in the population through the differential survival of its members. If it was beneficial to be very short, then short people would be more successful at surviving and reproducing than tall people. This would cause a trend in the population towards being shorter, which we would call evolution.<br>  <br>  Bear in mind, this is an extremely simplified example. For more information, see any textbook on genetics or evolution.|`|xopIi2Vfaa	the frequency of different genetic variants in a population  could not change over time if there weren't any genetic variation.

A sectional view of this floor plan would be required when you need to show detail that is not visible in the Floor Plan. For example, let's say you have two same size pipes running parallel to eachother, one above the other. You would only see the top pipe in the Floor Plan. A sectional view would show the two pipes as two circles, one above the other. The sectional view could also show other details such as the size and elevations of the pipes.<br>  There are several cases to consider when discussing drawing a circle or arc tangent to two circles. One circle could be inside the other, or the circles could be intersecting. Lets look at the case where the two circles are exterior to eachother. Let the two circles be A, and B. And let the radii of the circles be Ra and Rb respectively. Many arcs can be drawn tangent to both circles. Also, let d be the distance between the two circles. The diameter of the required arc must be greater than d. Choose a radius for the required arc and call it Rc. Geometrically add Ra + Rc and Rb + Rc. Scribe an arc of radius Ra + Rc centered at the center of circle A. Scribe an arc of radius Rb + Rc centered at the center of circle B.

MqFncBvJaa	There are many types of congenital (born with) spinal cord defects.  The absolute causes of these abnormalities are not known.  Some studies show the lack of foliac acid (obtained from green veggies) in the pregnant mother, but this hypothesis is not fully yet fully accepted.   The neural tube (which "holds" the spinal cord) and the spinal cord itself are formed during the very early days of gestation.  Sometimes, the mother does not even know she is pregnant.<br>  <br>  Characteristics are hard to describe because there are many spinal cord defect types (categories) and much variation among defect categories.<br>  <br>  Survival depends upon category and defect. Some infants die within a short time after birth.  Some "survive" if treated with a high degree and sophistication of neonatal (new born) care, and the defect is moderate.<br>  <br>  Survival....there is just plain survival :+(<br>  and then there is survival with good to reasonable life quality.   <br>  <br>  I knew a young man who survived into his 30s, but spent most of his life in bed and in a wheelchair.  Visits to a neighboring specialized children's hospital were frequent to treat on-going crises.<br>  <br>  Attitudes of family, friends and acquaintances, and the young man, himself, were varied.  <br>  <br>  ***PS  The wording of your question might contain a misspelling...did you mean "detected," inside of "defected."
xaTFGLESaa	You can argue that the first self replicating molecules that arose on Earth millions of years ago are the basic unit of life.  Without those molecules, the complex systems that exist today would not be possible.  The first simple organism that through the metabolism of Earth's atmosphere at that time started to pump oxygen into it allowed for the development of life as we know.  Cyanobacteria are among the oldest organism that still exist in the present.  Colonies of these organisms slowly but truly converted our atmosphere into what it is at present.  All that through chemical reactions.  The human body and other living organisms are biochemical factories.  We take nutrients from other organisms and convert them into useful molecules that regulate our internal metabolism.  Chemical energy is converted into other types of energy and thus, without those processes, life as we know it will not exist.  Carbon is obviously extremely important, without its ability to form complex compounds with itself and other elements, life will not exist.  Water is another important molecule, its chemical structure allows it to be a liquid at room temperature, without liquid water, there will not be life on planet Earth.  That is why we are so interested in finding water outside Earth, its presence can indicate the possibility of life.

29PW2BO4aa	When we are tired, our lungs begin to slow down, take fewer breaths, so are brains have less oxygen in them. Our blood isn't pumping as quickly as usual, so in order to put more oxygen in the brain, we yawn. The muscles relaxing forces more blood and oxygen too the brain, so we are more conscious and aware of what's going around us, otherwise we would be more prone to injury if we're tired. It's a habit that is evolutionary, the first humans didn't have yawning, it was a habit that came over time, and now is as instinctual as breathing.|`|e88c1397e1ea2a795cb0754c4302402faa	It's widely assumed that yawning occurs when we are tired or bored. Scientists are found to believe that it's a sort or reflex or acid hidden inside your lung, rib cage, upper chest, and even your brain. The acid detects your brain cells and observes your brain carefully. After it detects it, it lets out a sort of common gas found in your body, this same gas is the object of your urine and bacteria. The gas floats to your throat, and has an ingredient (like laughing gas) that makes you more tired than you really are, from there, the gas opens up like a bubble and crawls up your throat until it gets to your mouth.

ec6967e5f27cf5a7421e21c0c61dfd09aa	I'm going to start with an overview of pH just so everyone knows how to find it: <br>  <br>  Okay. pH is the negative log of the concentration of hydrogen ions. To calculate pH (p stands for "power of", H for "hydrogen") take your calculator and press the negative key (lower right hand corner of the number pad, (-) for those who don't know) and then press the button that says LOG. Your screen will show this:<br>  <br>  -log(<br>  <br>  Then enter the molar concentration of hydrogen atoms, close the parentheses, and press ENTER.<br>  <br>  Now that we've got the basics down, let's take a look at some of these examples. B is probably the easiest.<br>  <br>  H2O ? H+ + OH-<br>  <br>  Water has a special constant, Kw. It's the same as (Keq)([H2O]), since the concentration of water is constant. Assume the reaction is taking place under standard conditions, 298 K, where the value of Kw is 1 x 10 to the negative 14 (sorry, I can't get superscripts to work on here.). There are no coefficients in the above reaction, so the concentration of H+ equals the concentration of OH-. Therefore, since<br>  <br>  Kw=1x10 E-14=[H+][OH-]=(x)(x)<br>  <br>  [H+] is equal to x, and is the square root of Kw. Take the negative log of that, and it should be 7.<br>  <br>  Also: pOH is the negative log of the concentration of hydroxide (OH-) ions. pH + pOH=14, always. So you can also calculate the pH from the concentration of hydroxide, or vice versa. All the numbers are related.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps anyone with pH questions. Let me know if you need any more specifics.

YDgDdadHaa	It really depends on your interests. Journals tend to be much more focused on specific topics, with the exception of the "big" ones that you mentioned (Science, Nature, and a few others). They're also *quite* expensive, unless you have access to them through your local library/university. Try visiting a few of their websites and check out their topics before you buy a subscription. Often, a selection of recently published articles are available for free to the public.<br>  <br>  Magazine are cheaper, and yes, they are written more for a general audience. But they tend to bring a variety of subjects under one cover. They can be an excellent place to start, as often the articles are interpreted from current research and recently published journal articles. You could always go look up the research later if you wanted more information.<br>  <br>  I have a few other big ones to recommend, depending on your interests:<br>  <br>  Cell (very bio-oriented and they publish a lot of sub-journals)<br>  PNAS (Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences)<br>  PLoS (*free* public access from the Library of Medicine, but large variety of topics)<br>  JAMA or Lancet (for medicine)|`|Wn3LGHTvaa	It depends on your background. From least to most technical, I would rank them: Pop. Sci., Sci. News, Sci. Amer., Science, and Nature.<br>  <br>  The only general science publication I get is American Scientist but you have to be nominated to join the Society of the Sigma Xi to get it.<br>  <br>  I suggest that you go to libraries to read copies of the publications you mention to see what you can understand and what is of interest. You may have to go to a college or museum library to find Nature.|`|1505a95e660275609c4bb43c388cdf1aaa	It really depends on your background in the subjects.  Nature and Science are the top peer-reviewed journals in the country, with major discoveries from current research, but can be quite technical.  They're supposed to be not as technical as the top journals in specific fields - such as top medical or physics journals - but can still be hard to understand if you don't have a background in science (say, a PhD in something).<br>  <br>  I'm not familiar with Science News, but Popular Science and Scientific American not only have some new research, but more general reviews of some fields as well as speculative articles about possible upcoming accomplishments (time travel, quantum computing, etc).<br>  <br>  Maybe it would help if you could pick a specific field?  For example, Physics Today is a good source for physicists, both PhD and at the beginning undergraduate level - it has summaries of new research and interesting developments but is written so that most people with a few physics courses behind them can understand it.<br>  <br>  Or you could subscribe to <a href="http://www.arxiv.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.arxiv.org</a> , which has most of the new papers that will appear / have appeared in peer-reviewed journals in the more technical sciences; and is free, unlike the actual journals which can cost hundreds of dollars or more a year to subscribe to.|`|3ceb07ef3923052f53770c9898aa03baaa	I highly recommend PNAS, or "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences".   "Science" lately has been edging towards simlifications for the benefit of the casual reader, but so far Proceedings has been doings pretty well at avoiding that.  <br>  <br>  It does depend on your interests, though.  PNAS seems to go in phases, with one particular issue focusing on one aspect of study/research, but if you're subscribing long-term (i.e. a year or two) then you'll really benefit hugely from this journal.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!

UOthWXxYaa	the pulse is controlled by the nervous system. when we exercise the body detects that more oxygen is needed for respiration so the heart beats faster to provide the oxygen to the muscles that need it through the red blood cells. also the ventilation rate also increases becasue of this so the lungs also inhale and exhale faster so c02 and 02 is removed and taken in quicker. <br>   |`|WMXY3kxtaa	bcos we are running.....by nature<br>  when you face a giant your heart beats also beats fast.....and you r not running also that time.....<br>  that's  Nature.....|`|AA12124533	because when we run we consume more energy and the the heart starts producing or rather refining the blood at a faster rate|`|jKbQaQ5iaa	When we see our favorite food, our digestive juices begin to flow. Similarly while watching a horror movie our heart beats faster and pupil get dilated. These responses are involuntary and mainly occur in cardiac muscles, smooth muscles of internal organs and glands (salivary and sweat).<br>   The autonomic nervous system also called as visceral efferent (motor) system  innervates these parts and is divided into parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) and sympathetic nervous system (SNS).   Both systems comprise effector neurons, which connect the central neural system to their effector organs. Each pathway consists of preganglionic neuron and a postganglionic neuron. In sympathetic system the synapses between the two are near the spinal cord whereas in the parasympathetic synapse are found near to, or within, the effector organ. <br>   The effects of the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems normally oppose one another, i.e. they are antagonistic systems and the balance between the two systems accurately regulate involuntary activities of glands and organs. The parasympathetic system decreases the cardiac output and during emergency sympathetic increases the cardiac output.. Similarly parasympathetic decreases the ventilation rate and sympathetic increases it.

They just cannot force/require others to do so with them.<br>  <br>  Secondly, when asking a question which is solely for the purpose of stirring up discussion and/or eliciting a certain response, it is much more effective if you use proper grammar and punctuation.

o2WEoWp5aa	I don't know that "disadvantages" should really be the right word... <br>  <br>  The problem with half life is that it's NEVER gone. It goes in fractional increments, and as such, there will always be a trace of the elements. |`|AAnmFbnbaa	There wouldn't always be a trace of the element. Half life is a statistical average and therefore is only appropriate when there is a large number of atoms present, which generally there would be.  <br>  <br>  "A half-life often describes the decay of discrete entities, such as radioactive atoms. In that case, it does not work to use the definition "half-life is the time required for exactly half of the entities to decay". For example, if there is just one radioactive atom with a half-life of 1 second, there will not be "half of an atom" left after 1 second. There will be either zero atoms left or one atom left, depending on whether or not the atom happens to decay.<br>  <br>  Instead, the half-life is defined in terms of probability. It is the time when the expected value of the number of entities that have decayed is equal to half the original number. For example, one can start with a single radioactive atom, wait its half-life, and measure whether or not it decays in that period of time. Perhaps it will and perhaps it will not. But if this experiment is repeated again and again, it will be seen that it decays within the half life 50% of the time." -wikipedia.<br>  <br>  Therefore the main disadvantage of half life is that it is a statistical average and therefore when the number of atoms is small the eror margins are very large.<br>

lKXLaJ0Taa	The answer to this question is not simple because the parameters will change depending on many factors.  Typically, a greater than 40-50% blood loss even in a healthy young person will cause death if fluids are not replaced.  But this will not be an immediate death unless it is over 50%.  Below that, there will be a blood pressure drop and organs will be sacrificed.  Vasoconstriction will decrease blood flow to all organs except the heart and brain and this will cause acute renal failure, liver failure, and failure of other organs (pancreas, intestines, etc.) and this will contribute to the eventual death of the person.  Below 40% blood loss will have a significant impact but this depends on the age and health of the person.  For example, a 25% blood loss in a healthy young man may cause tachycardia but not cause dizziness or passing out whereas in a 75 year old man, it may precipitate a heart attack and more likely cause him to pass out.  Usually, less than 10% blood loss will not have any significant effects in a healthy individual.  If fluids are replaced relatively soon, like within an hour, even 20% blood loss will not have a major effect in a healthy person.  <br>  <br>  As far as passing out, some people will pass out from a vago-vagal reaction caused by sudden decrease in blood pressure not only from the bleeding but from the emotion of seeing his own blood (people who faint at the sight of blood.)  Since it is the cerebral perfusion pressure that determines if a person passes out and not blood loss, many factors can play into how much blood loss is needed for someone to pass out.  Vasoconstriction can increase perfusion pressure, cardiac output (how hard the heart is pumping) will also influence it, the age of the person, what medications he/she is taking, whether they are upright or lying down, etc.  Yes it differs with weight, but also age, physical condition, how hydrated the person was to begin with, medical condition, whether they have vasovagal reactions easily, whether they are under he influence of certain drugs, and if the blood loss is acute (rapid) or chronic (over a period of days).|`|O8GyAk81aa	I saw an interview two nights ago from a doctor that said after 3 pints your body's cells start to burst from lack of oxygen causing irreversible damage(example: heart failure) but could still be reviveable until the loss of 4 pints in which case most any person would die.|`|c0a5c8943ce6f1d0df1e342f2f780150aa	5|`|W2YtVUqKaa	some people pass out around 1 pint. <br>  <br>  you can probably lose about 2-3 pints depending on your size and blood pressure before passing out

6GB5P7ojaa	An average bolt of lightning carries an electric current of 40 kiloamperes (kA), and transfers a charge of five coulombs and 500 MJ. Large bolts of lightning can carry up to 120 kA and 350 coulombs[1]. The voltage is proportional to the length of the bolt.<br>  <br>  Lightning leader development is not just a matter of the dielectric breakdown air, which is about three million volts per metre. The ambient electric fields required for lightning leader propagation can be one or two orders of magnitude less than dielectric breakdown strength. The potential gradient inside a well-developed return-stroke channel is in the order of hundreds of volts per metre due to intense channel ionisation, resulting in a true power output in the order of a megawatt per metre for a vigorous return stroke current of 100 kA. The average power output of a single lightning stroke is about a terawatt (1012 W) and it lasts for around 30 microseconds.<br>  <br>  Lightning rapidly heats the air in its immediate vicinity to around 20,000 °C (36,000 °F) - about three times the temperature of the surface of the Sun. This compresses the surrounding clear air and creates a supersonic shock wave which decays to an acoustic wave that is heard as thunder.<br>  <br>  The return stroke of a lightning bolt follows a charge channel about a centimetre (0.4-in) wide.<br>  <br>  Different locations have different potentials (voltages) and currents for an average lightning strike. For example, Florida, with the United States' largest number of recorded strikes in a given period during the summer season, has very sandy ground in some areas and conductive saturated mucky soil in others. As much of Florida lies on a peninsula, it is bordered by the ocean on three sides. The result is the daily development of sea and lake breeze boundaries that collide and produce thunderstorms. The difference in each case may consist of differences in voltage levels between clouds and ground. NASA scientists have found the radio waves created by lightning clear a safe zone in the radiation belt surrounding the earth. This zone, known as the Van Allen Belt slot, can potentially be a safe haven for satellites, offering them protection from the Sun's radiation.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps!<br>  Good luck!

The base is 16 dm. divide that in 1/2 so now you have two sides to one of the 2 triangles. One side is 15dm, the other is 8dm and the third is A squared (8 x 8 = 64) + B squared (15 X 15= 225) = C squared so what's the square root of 289?. 17 (8 +17= 25)..

The actual acceleration of the body is determined by the vector sum of all forces acting on it (known as net force or resultant force). In an extended body, it may also cause rotation or deformation of the body.

Winds can blow from any<br>  direction, so at any given spot in the ocean, waves are typically coming from and going in a wide<br>  variety of directions. However, if you think of waves at a beach, you know that they pretty much<br>  go right towards the shoreline. In other words, they go towards you, not up or down the coast.<br>  This means that as waves approach a shoreline, they turn or “bend” towards the shoreline, a<br>  process we call “wave refraction.” (Not reflection: reflection is when a wave bounces off<br>  something, like a wall.) The result is the wave crests tend to parallel or “match” the shape of the<br>  shoreline as they break.<br>  Source(s):<br>  <br>  www.elcamino.edu/faculty/tnoyes/Readin...|`|WbVE1cXKaa	waves bend toward the shore as the depth of the water decreases.  They tend to move perpendicular to the obstruction.  It is a form of refraction.  They slow down preferentially on the shallow side, allowing the faster stuff out deeper to catch up, which makes the wave turn perpendicular to the shore.

xbma9SuWaa	An electromagnetic wave is casued by accelerating charages (A charge could just be moving up and down).<br>  <br>  A charge moving back in forth cause an electric field to chagne (If you measure at a specific point).   This in turn creates a magnetic field.  The magnetic field will eventually change in time ast the electric field changes.  A magnetic field changing in time creates an electric field and so  forth.    This process will propagate outward from the source.  Analogous to waving a jump rope up and down and the disturbance in one part of the rope affect the adjecent part.   <br>  In other words the wave travels with a velocity and energy and hence moementum (even though it has no mass).<br>  <br>  Anything with charge can create EM waves.  For instance...if you could wave your hand fast enough back and forth light would be eminatting from your hand.    In real life thought.... even the motion of molecules in your body caused EM radiation to be emitted (Infrared radiation).     EM waves can be modified and changed to carry tv and radio signals (radio waves).   <br>  <br>  The more power that is put into accelerating the higher energy EM waves you will get.    When you get high enough in energy it starts to become dangerous becasue they can have enrough momentum to knock electons off of molcules in your body...chemically altering your cells, possible even DNA (Ionizing radiation).  Im gonna stop typing now.

6uo0NbUgaa	The initial Kinetic Energy (K) will drop to zero at the top of its path and will all be converted to Potential Energy(U).<br>  So K=.5mv^2 and U=mgh.  K-U=0.  (Or vice versa depending on your frame of reference.)  ...they have K+U because one of them is negative but it works the same way.<br>  The Kinetic Energy is easy to find:<br>  K=.5(3.2kg)3.75m/s^2<br>  To find U you have to take into account the 16 degree incline and use trig to find its height.<br>  <br>  Also, since you have friction, there is a force in the opposite direction of the velocity.  Is the friction only on the incline or throughout?  Draw a force diagram and sum the forces in each direction.

There's huge amounts of data and evidence supporting the accuracy of this theory, and the fact that man can look back into 13.7 billion years of space-time to see within a second after the birth of our universe, is absolutely the most amazing thing.

o33aBcqtaa	Unfortunately you did not upload the whole solution so one can only guess as to what is going on. But I can give a little of my own way of looking at it.<br>  <br>  First the point P(4,0,0). You want a point in the plane and this is a simple solution to 2x -3y + z = 8 (I am assuming a typo where you had 2x - 3x...). So this is just some point in the plane. You can pick some other one if you want. This point is then used to create a vector from A to P.<br>  <br>  Next find the normal vector to the plane. This is just:<br>  N = 2i - 3j + k (READ NOTE)<br>  <br>  We now have two vectors N and AP. Taking the dot product witll give us the angle A between them. The distance D from the plane to the point is given by cos(A) = D / |AP|<br>  <br>  AP <dot> N = |AP|*|N|*cos(A) = |AP|*|N|*D/|AP| = |N|*D<br>  D = [ |AP| <dot> |N| ] / |N|<br>  <br>  What the purpose of this point n(2,-3,6) is I can not say. Calling it "n" seems to connect it in some way with the normal to the plane but that is only a guess. But I can say that it does not lie on a line perpendicular to the plane and going through the point A.<br>  <br>  If you could include more details I might be able to see what they are getting at with this point "n".<br>  <br>  NOTE TO MADHUKAR: The equation as given is  2x-3x+z-8=0. z has no 6 in front of it.

By breathing shallow rapid breaths, you are tricking your body into thinking it has a large concentration of oxygen.  That's why its treated by breathing into a bag and hence breathing in exhaled CO2.  Oxygen causes your blood to become basic in pH, where as breathing in CO2 causes carbonic acid buildup in the blood, hence causing your blood to become acidic.  H2O + CO2 = H + HCO3- (carbonic acid)  <br>  Many olympic swimmers use to induce the hyperventilated state so they could swim underwater for prolonged periods.

Evolution is about how life forms change over time.  Astronomy and geology tell us about the shape of the Earth.<br>  <br>  The answer to your question is because there is no top and bottom to a planet--we call the north pole the "top" because we happen to put north at the top of maps.  It's entirely arbitrary--basically, people in Europe put north at the top of maps because they lived in the Northern Hemisphere.  You could put north at the bottom of your maps and it would be just as valid--just strange 'cause it's not what you're used to.  Think about it--you're in the Northern Hemisphere; do you feel the Earth pulling you south?<br>  <br>  Gravity pulls everything toward the center of the Earth.  That's why people in the Southern Hemisphere don't fall off.<br>  <br>  Yes, heliocentrism is a theory, just like gravity, electromagnetism, and the germ theory of disease.  Care to touch a live wire to show to us that electromagnetism is "just a theory"?  There's no such thing as "just a theory" in science--in science, a theory isn't a guess; it's an explanation that's very well-supported by the evidence.<br>  <br>  Yes, I do think the Bible is wrong, if you take the geocentric parts of it literally.

Creationists have tried to poke holes in it to try to "disprove" it, which isn't the way scientific theories rise or fall--you have to show that the evidence better supports a different explanation, not nitpick details of the current theory.  And the creationists' arguments have been definitively refuted anyway.<br>  <br>  Creationism is wrong.  That's been shown conclusively--that is, the evidence is very strongly against it.  Same goes for geocentrism and flat earth.|`|7ydnDQl2aa	gravity - "down" doesn't mean south.<br>  The way we actually perceive down is towards the center of the Earth.|`|4c54zUjuaa	troll much?|`|g4APbW4Naa	The Earth is spherical, and gravity works equally in all directions.  Arbirtrary human directions like "North" and "South" do not translate into up and down.  What you call "Down" is actually "toward the earth".  Gravity holds everything down, as in to the Earth.<br>  <br>  You have to think of looking at the Earth from very far away - people don't fall off the South Pole, because that would be "up" (away from the earth), and things don't fall up, they fall down.<br>  <br>  The Bible was written at a time when people didn't fully understand how the solar system works - scientists, even early Greek scientists, used shadows to prove that the Earth  rotates around the sun, and not the other way around.<br>  <br>  And the Catholic Church, which labelled Galileo a "heretic" for suggesting that the Earth rotates around the sun, eventually admitted their mistake.  About 350 years too late, but they did finally concede that the earth is not stationary.<br>  <br>  Evolution is taught in schools because SCIENCE is taught in schools.  Evolution is science, and creationism is religion.<br>  There is scientific evidence - fossil records, genetic data - for evolution, and now the Catholic Church is coming around to admit that as well.<br>  <br>  On September 2-3, 2006, Pope Benedict XVI conducted a seminar examining the theory of evolution and its impact on Catholicism's teaching of Creation.<br>  <br>  Evolution isn't a perfect theory, but it's the best one that we've got. Think of it as a work in progress, like all scientific theories are.  It's certainly better than "God snapped his fingers and made it happen".|`|mePEVFreaa	Well first off the earth is spherical in shape.  The proof of that is satelite imagery from space.  People don't fall off because of the force (pull of gravity)  Oh, there is one exception to all of that.  People in China are upside down because we are right side up lol lol.<br>  <br>  Edit<br>  Leon B says that if you have a current theory you cannot propose another theory until you disprove the current theory wrong.  That is not really accurate.  I think that Evolution is more of a Hypothesis then a theory and the reality for Evolution is that it will never be proven.  Since politics gets in the way of science just as it was pointed out that religion got in the way of science; just because they teach it doesn't make it accurate.  Experimentation and observation make something accurate, not what you believe because you're liberal or conservative or voted for Democrats or Republicans.|`|gVHKHYzZaa	because gravity keeps us sticking to the earth.|`|2VdZ60DRaa	i dont know why evilution is taut in school and im bening taut it now and it is boring.

Your investment in solar will not be affected by other power sources coming opn line.<br>  <br>  Fission is the power that is used in existing commercial nuclear power plants around the world.|`|86fbb9145bb0e0ea3371b9ebad6e2bddaa	Doubt it will be used.|`|899c6a371bce238646502edb0cee925aaa	People get their own solar panels for two reasons: to save cost on energy over a long period of time and to reduce damage to the environment.  Fusion cannot happen (yet) at temperatures near what we can handle.  If they were to discover cold fusion right now, it would probably be very expensive and not viable for general use, or at least would not be a cost-effective improvement.  Also tit would probably not be a very environmental-friendly process.  We can always dream, but I say go ahead and get the panels because they won't be out of date anytime soon.<br>  <br>  Oh yeah, solar panels use fusion energy too ;)|`|lEFEKi6Qaa	Are you trolling for dummies?<br>  <br>  Fusion power is the power generated by nuclear fusion reactions and has been used extensively throughout the world for power generation beginning in the 60's.  Nuclear fission reactors, usually pressurized water reactors with energy conversion based on a steam-turbine cycle, have been used extensively to power ships for decades.<br>  <br>  Ironically although the US contributed significantly to the development they've fallen behind the rest of the world in application.|`|QFfLXNPfaa	I think it could happen anytime soon .

Fusion is reportedly still in the experimental stage.  If you want to save money and use alternative energy sources solar is good for the long term.  Yes it will bite you in the beginning but I think you'll sleep better knowing the steps you're taking to become less dependent on the current system.  Fusion probably won't be released for public use until the controllers have sucked every other resource dry.  (Including us.)

His team also had data on Haumea but the discovery is credited to a Spanish team who were the first to submit data to the Minor Planet Center.  The situation is a rather acrimonious one as there seems to be evidence that the Spanish team used publicly available information on the pointing history of Brown's telescope to help them.  Although the Spanish team has the discovery credit, both teams were invited to submit naming suggestions and the name adopted (Haumea) is that suggested by Brown.<br>  <br>  Brown was also involved in the discovery of other objects that are yet to be officially recognised as dwarf planets such as: Sedna, Orcus and Quaoar.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.gps.caltech.edu/~mbrown/" rel="nofollow">http://www.gps.caltech.edu/~mbrown/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.gps.caltech.edu/~mbrown/dwarfplanets.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.gps.caltech.edu/~mbrown/dwarf...</a>

You can search my answers to find the kinds of information I have posted.

You can go to my website, www.curvedarrowpress.com, to learn about how I have done this and my results with students I have taught. I cannot say with absolute certainty that I can help every student and it is even more difficult to make those assertions if I have little or not contact with those students, but I do feel that I can and have been successful in teaching students how to learn organic chemistry reactions.

86tx0gGmaa	Different schools have different programs for getting into jobs, but generally, if you are a full-time student, you won't be having a full-time job, especially in your normal field of study. What is much more common is getting internships or co-ops during the summers or in place of a semester of school, which are both paid. You can try to get a job at the school in a lab for your major or something or as a TA, but there are never any guarantees. Your prior experience might help you get a better job than myself (went to college directly out of high school) while in school, but I wouldn't think you would have time for much more. I know the main way to get real jobs our of my school (University of Illinois) is to go to the career fairs put on by the school. There are a lot of companies at those, so use them to your advantage if your school offers them.<br>  <br>  As for the degrees, the plumbing would more directly feed into mechanical engineering. One of the mainstays of ME is fluid mechanics, and if you so choose, you can do all sorts of pipe flow stuff with that. I realize that plumbing might have begun to bore you, but there is a difference between fixing/installing the stuff compared to, say, designing the piping systems on a nuclear aircraft carrier. Of course there is a lot more to fluid mechanics than pipe flow, and a lot more in ME than fluids. There is also controls/dynamics, materials/structures, heat transfer/thermodynamics/fluids and then, of course, straight up mechanical design that would all be things that an ME does.<br>  <br>  EE, on the other hand, requires a lot of courses in circuits, logic and electricity and magnetism. It all comes down to which you prefer. In HS, when (if) you took physics, did you like the mechanics portion of it more or the electricity portion more? That would be a good way to decide which direction to go. Of course, you could always switch to the other one after a semester or two if you decide you don't like it.|`|EGPeQxpLaa	I don't know about in the US but in UK many colleges have arrangements to get engineering students (who are in demand) into local companies on (paid) work experience or apprentice schemes - have you asked your college about this?
2lQ8DJAcaa	The Wealth of the Rainforests <br>  <br>  <br>  The Amazon Rainforest covers over a billion acres, encompassing areas in Brazil, Venezuela, Colombia and the Eastern Andean region of Ecuador and Peru. If Amazonia were a country, it would be the ninth largest in the world. <br>  <br>  The Amazon Rainforest has been described as the "Lungs of our Planet" because it provides the essential environmental world service of continuously recycling carbon dioxide into oxygen. More than 20 percent of the world oxygen is produced in the Amazon Rainforest. <br>  <br>  More than half of the world's estimated 10 million species of plants, animals and insects live in the tropical rainforests. One-fifth of the world's fresh water is in the Amazon Basin. <br>  <br>  One hectare (2.47 acres) may contain over 750 types of trees and 1500 species of higher plants. <br>  <br>  At least 80% of the developed world's diet originated in the tropical rainforest. Its bountiful gifts to the world include fruits like avocados, coconuts, figs, oranges, lemons, grapefruit, bananas, guavas, pineapples, mangos and tomatoes; vegetables including corn, potatoes, rice, winter squash and yams; spices like black pepper, cayenne, chocolate, cinnamon, cloves, ginger, sugar cane, tumeric, coffee and vanilla and nuts including Brazil nuts and cashews. <br>  <br>  At least 3000 fruits are found in the rainforests; of these only 200 are now in use in the Western World. The Indians of the rainforest use over 2,000. <br>  <br>  Rainforest plants are rich in secondary metabolites, particularly alkaloids. Biochemists believe alkaloids protect plants from disease and insect attacks. Many alkaloids from higher plants have proven to be of medicinal value and benefit. <br>  <br>  Currently, 121 prescription drugs currently sold worldwide come from plant-derived sources. And while 25% of Western pharmaceuticals are derived from rainforest ingredients, less than 1% of these tropical trees and plants have been tested by scientists. <br>  <br>  The U.S. National Cancer Institute has identified 3000 plants that are active against cancer cells. 70% of these plants are found in the rainforest. Twenty-five percent of the active ingredients in today's cancer-fighting drugs come from organisms found only in the rainforest. <br>  <br>  Vincristine, extracted from the rainforest plant, periwinkle, is one of the world's most powerful anticancer drugs. It has dramatically increased the survival rate for acute childhood leukemia since its discovery. <br>  <br>  In 1983, there were no U.S. pharmaceutical manufacturers involved in research programs to discover new drugs or cures from plants. Today, over 100 pharmaceutical companies and several branches of the US government, including giants like Merck and The National Cancer Institute, are engaged in plant research projects for possible drugs and cures for viruses, infections, cancer, and even AIDS.|`|a86HbDIZaa	No, I can't tell you all I know about rain forests.

WzmwVlLnaa	Okay, well the p'(t)=7 means that the slope of the graph is always equal to 7, or that the population increased by 7 every year. So if you take p'(t)=7, then integrate to find p(t) you get that p(t)=7t+c where c is the initial value, in this case c=420.

That would mean the population is increasing linearly from 1900 by 7 million per year; so at the beginning of 1907 the total population would be 420 + 7 * 7 or 469 million.

AA12085205	The M?bius strip or M?bius band (pronounced /?m?bi?s/) is a surface with only one side and only one boundary component. It has the mathematical property of being non-orientable. It was co-discovered independently by the German mathematicians August Ferdinand M?bius and Johann Benedict Listing in 1858.<br>  <br>  A model can easily be created by taking a paper strip and giving it a half-twist, and then merging the ends of the strip together to form a single strip. In Euclidean space there are in fact two types of M?bius strips depending on the direction of the half-twist: clockwise and counterclockwise. The M?bius strip is therefore chiral, which is to say that it is "handed".|`|6170974434ada9d54dff4478d433a10baa	A mobius strip is a strip of material that has only one continuous side. You can make one by cutting a strip of paper about a foot long and 1-2 inches wide. Bend the strip into a circle, then flip one end of it over and glue the two ends together. You can show that it has only one surface by starting a pencil line down the center of the strip. Without removing the pencil from the paper, your line will come back to the starting point.<br>  <br>  It is named after August Ferdinand Mobius, a German mathematician (1790-1868).|`|f896fb2755e9ba1bf76a0ecfb72d8128aa	It's a looped piece of paper (well, any material, really) that has a twist in it.

6e26e7ba55de9146616dc8e362f5cc8daa	The actual complete answer is a reduced air pressure above the wing and an increased pressure below the wing.<br>  <br>  It is a common misconception that an AIR FOIL (airplane wing, propeller blade, birds wing, etc.) generates LIFT due to a difference in velocities of air (or fluid) flow over the two surfaces of the wing due to the shape of the wing.  If that were true then planes would not be able to fly upside-down (which many of them can and do).  It is true that when a fluid (or in this case air) increases in velocity, it experiences a drop in pressure.  However, the assumption that the shape of an airfoil increases the velocity of air above the wing and is the primary source of lift makes the assumption that the same air molecules separated at the leading edge of a wing meet again at the trailing edge and is incorrect.  The shape of the wing has more to do with reducing drag.<br>  <br>  The answer has more to do with the ANGLE OF ATTACK.  Note that a flat object can generate lift with the right angle of attack.  When the LEADING EDGE of a bird's wing displaces air above and below the wing and the wing has an angle of attack, two things happen that generate LIFT.  Remember the law of inertia: an object in motion will continue in its path at that speed unless acted upon by another force.  Apply that principle to the air that travels along the top and the bottom of the wing.  On the top of the wing a vacuum is created where the air is sucked back down toward the wing but is trying to resist the change in direction.  On the bottom of the wing the air simply runs into the surface of the wing and is deflected downward creating a buildup of pressure where the air is trying to resist the change in direction.  Increased pressure below the wing + decreased pressure above the wing = lift.  This is a simplified explanation.|`|6470625eaf1b61073e77533cdf934149aa	the air flow below the wings is faster than the air flow above the wings, this creats lift, plus the whole flapping of the wings helps too|`|6170974434ada9d54dff4478d433a10baa	Your (a) and (b) answers say the same thing. The correct answer is not listed. The correct answer is reduced air pressure above the wing. Just as in an airplane.

qmL9yfOkaa	Human body lice have evolved to attach their eggs to the woven fabrics of clothes and bedsheets and when placed in hair they quickly move back to clothing. All studies show that when an individual has both head and body lice, the two populations are genetically distinct and do not interbreed. head and body lice will only interbreed in the lab and produce many sterile offspring.<br>  <br>  While I never heard of the invention of clothing angle, parasite genetics have been used to help track prehistoric migrations of people around the planet.<br>  <br>  Because head and body lice populations do not interbreed and the radiation between the different genetic groups of head an body lice happened around 540 000 years ago and body lice can only lay their eggs on clothing it's a reasonable assumption to say "Clothing had to have been invented by at least 540 000 years ago fro head lice to change into body lice."<br>  <br>  However, it's still a guess because parasites like lice obviously track with the divergence of their hosts. As ancient populations of humans grew, split and then became isolated as they spread across the planet, the louse populations would have split and diverged as well.<br>  <br>  So an equally reasonable hypothesis is that the head louse population diverged into groups half a million years ago, and then when clothing was invented 30 thousand years ago (the oldest needles) some of those groups of head lice then made the jump to clothing.<br>  <br>  So, at best body lice give us an earliest possible date for the invention of clothing but they are not conclusive evidence.

Dark matter is postulated to explain the flat rotation curves of spiral galaxies and other evidence of "missing mass" in the universe. According to present observations of structures larger than galaxies, as well as Big Bang cosmology, dark matter and dark energy account for the vast majority of the mass in the observable universe. The observed phenomena which imply the presence of dark matter include the rotational speeds of galaxies, orbital velocities of galaxies in clusters, gravitational lensing of background objects by galaxy clusters such as the Bullet Cluster, and the temperature distribution of hot gas in galaxies and clusters of galaxies. Dark matter also plays a central role in structure formation and galaxy evolution, and has measurable effects on the anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background. All these lines of evidence suggest that galaxies, clusters of galaxies, and the universe as a whole contain far more matter than that which interacts with electromagnetic radiation: the remainder is frequently called the "dark matter component," even though there is a small amount of baryonic dark matter."|`|sjPUCMbkaa	It's nothing.

BrarMA1Haa	On the schematic, the battery polarities are backwards.  Swap the "+" and "-" characters on the schematic.  If you've hooked up the circuit as shown, then the battery polarity is a big problem, so check that.<br>  <br>  The transistor should have a resistor in series with the base lead, unless your 555-type circuit limits the base drive.  (The base lead is the lead at the top that drops into the horizontal-bar part of the transistor symbol.  The leads read left-to-right as emitter-base-collector, or E-B-C).  Without a resistor, large currents will flow through the base-emitter junction.  We'll calculate the resistor value R in a moment.<br>  <br>  The other consideration is that a switching transistor is rated to handle a limited amount of current, say perhaps 0.5A, with a dissipation limit of 500mW.  The heat dissipation assumes that the transistor case has a heat sink, so running it at a lower level is prudent if you don't have a heat sink.<br>  <br>  To keep the transistor dissipating as little power as possible while passing the motor current, you want the transistor to be driven into saturation so that the collector-emiter voltage is on the order of 0.2V.  If the collector current is say 0.25A, then the power dissipated by the transistor is approximately 0.25A x 0.2V = 50mW, no problem.  If instead there isn't sufficient base drive and the collector-emiter voltage is 2.0V, then the power dissipated is approximately 0.25A x 2.0V = 500mW, and the transistor will run very hot and probably fail.<br>  <br>  To calculate the base drive necessary, pick a design value for the collector current (say 0.5A even if you intend to run less).  Look up the DC current gain of the transistor (which is the ratio of collector current divided by base current) and has the symbol hFE.  hFE will vary with collector current.  But let's say that at a collector current of 0.5A, the hFE is 80.  Then the minimum base current needed will be:<br>  Ib = Ic / hFE = 0.5A / 80 = 6.25mA.<br>  Now the resistance R of the base resistor can be calculated.  The base-emitfer voltage will be about 0.7V (for a silicon NPN).  Your source voltage is 3V.  So the base resistor should be a maximum of:<br>  R = (Vs - Vb) / Ib = (3.0V - 0.7V) / 6.25mA = 368 ohm<br>  You could choose a 330 ohm resistor which is a standard value.  Or parallel some larger resistors or connect in series some smaller resistors to yield a resistance at or below 368 ohm.<br>  <br>  Suppose your motor draws more than 0.25A (say 0.6A).  You can parallel multiple transistors as long as each one has a separate base resistor.  Connect the collectors together.  To promote equal current division among the transistors, include a 0.5 ohm resistor in series with each emitter (or just try it without the emitter resistors).  Alternatively, get a transistor that will handle more current.<br>  <br>  The numbers used above are assumed.  You can look up real numbers on the data sheet for the transistor that you are using and recalculate the resistor value(s).<br>  <br>  Good luck.  Hope that helps.|`|WnOgbOmiaa	I can't really tell, but why aren't you using any resistors?

4fWZL4TRaa	Generally, conductivity of a liquid is measured as ohms per unit volume, typically one cubic cm. This means a reference chamber with internal dimensions say 10mm x 10mm x 10mm with electrodes on two sides, of area 10mm x 10mm. The conductivity is simply the reciprocal of resistance (1/R), so a log function. The electrode chamber can be a different volume, with appropriate corrections. For very highly conducting (low resistance) the electrodes need a higher surface area. The current density is kept low to minimise heating etc. Note that the conductivity usually has a strong temperature co-efficient so an accurate temperature reading is important.<br>  <br>  A DC ohmmeter is not likely to give a good result, as there is galvanic effects (unwanted voltages like a battery).<br>  <br>  An AC ohmmeter is easily constructed as a voltage source in series with a reference resistor and the electrodes. Measure the voltage across the electrodes or the resistor to determine the resistance/conductivity across the electrodes. Obviously this is for a specific frequency, but usually 50Hz or some audio frequency is fine. Eliminate ground loops by using a floating supply (transformer) and eliminate DC effects by coupling the voltmeter through a capacitor. Ground the liquid or container or one electrode etc to minimise interference from stray electric field (capacitive coupling from mains for example). As the conductivity drops (high resistance) more and more precautions are needed).<br>  <br>  For high precision measurements a guard electrode may be used. I have seen some with up to 5 electrodes.<br>  <br>  There is an inductive version of this too, where the liquid represents a shorted turn in a transformer. The primary is a toroidal core, with a precision volume hole in the middle. This type has to be calibrated against a reference, as part of the magnetic field is not included in the reference volume. Usually other windings are used to work with a feedback system in this method.<br>  <br>  If you just want comparative measurements a pair of electrodes in a large tank will do. They can be calibrated against a true conductivity meter. Note that bringing the electrodes near the side/top/bottom will disturb the volume of the external electric field and change the readings.
EN32vSsCaa	Oxycodine?  How about oxycodone.  Oxycontin is a brand name drug whose generic is oxycodone sustained release.|`|6KaMW1Vzaa	I, too, think you meant to ask about oxycodone. The big deal with OxyContin isn't the drug but the delivery system. The pill is designed for slow release, to deliver fairly constant levels over about twelve hours. Of course, the druggies break it up to release all the oxycodone immediately. Consider that the normal Percocet contains five to ten milligrams of oxycodone in it, and OxyContin comes in 40 and 80 mg strengths, and you'll see why it's so popular to divert to illicit use.<br>  By the way, note the capitalization. Older and still effective is MS-Contin, a sustained-release morphine sulfate tablet, so the "Contin" is almost a separate word, in the world of cute brand names for drugs.
SejorKDfaa	First write the given equation in slope-intercept form:<br>  <br>  x+9y=4 --> y = -x/9 + 4/9<br>  <br>  For any line to be parallel to this line, it must have a slope of -1/9. So write<br>  <br>  y = -x/9 + b<br>  <br>  From the point given, you know that when x=2, y must be 6. Substituting finds b:<br>  <br>  ( y )  = -( x )/9 + b<br>  <br>  ( 6 )  = -( 2 )/9 + b<br>  <br>  b = 6 + 2/9 = 54/9 + 2/9 = 56/9<br>  <br>  So the equation is<br>  <br>  y = -x/9 + 56/9
SvmZlLdaaa	Well, if the dog had sex with the boy against his will, then he was sexually assaulted by the dog, wasn't he? <br>  <br>  However, when people say that a person having sex with an animal is abusing the animal, I really don't see how they can reach this conclusion in the case of, say, a woman having sex with her dog. I mean, there is no way a woman could force a dog to have sex with her against its will - if it didn't want to do it, it wouldn't, and she couldn't make it. I suppose it's possible that a man could penetrate an animal against its will, but I can't imagine it would be a particularly good idea to try and have sex with an unwilling partner who has a mouth full of sharp teeth. I remember seeing a documentary a few years ago about an American man who married his horse (seriously!), and he said that when he had sex with it he didn't restrain it in any way. If it didn't like what he was doing it could have kicked, bitten or simply walked away, but it didn't. Of course, given the size of a stallion's penis compared to a man's, maybe the horse just couldn't feel anything ...|`|u1ZG4qgzaa	In this case it was sexual assault but not on the pit bull.  I do agree that beastiality is not always sexual assault though.|`|C1XKd1q9aa	The animals never want to do it. The pitbull probably had something wrong with it's brain or thought that the boy was also a pitbull. It is not the fact that it wanted to have sex with the two year old, but he just did it because thats what the dog does. It is considered sexual assault though because it was against the boys will. Hopefully the dog was put down.|`|3UMF0Egbaa	riiggghhhttt....animals never want to do it huh?<br>   I had my leg humped by a dog and I was an unwilling participant - I guess I should have called the police because I was molested - darn golden retrievers.<br>  it is considered sexual assault because people don't like the idea of bestiality<br>  while a man I suppose could forcibly rape an animal a woman couldn't. but how do you enact a double standard law? plus since the majority of people are against this type of activity they just leave it stated that way. who really is going to try to get the law changed???<br>  I remember a few years ago they took it off the books in one state there was huge uproar from the people - they were trying to remove old laws that they felt didn't pertain anymore

CgYl4mWBaa	The answer is implied by the question, "absorb more radiation...."  If they didn't absorb radiation, they would appear about as light as the sky around them, only darker because they reflect some of the incident radiation.<br>  <br>  If the sun is very low in the sky, so that the line of sight of the sun is below rain or other clouds, those clouds reflect the suns light to the observer, appearing very bright.|`|d0oGeasiaa	My guess would be that the more water in the cloud would absorb more light. The more light absorbed the darker the cloud appears.
17d2136cb28b3dcd96bfa98507022f5eaa	I've used binoculars, telescopes, and microscopes all my life and ever encountered this problem. It may be that your eye is too close or too far away from the eyepiece. There's an optimum distance (eye relief) for any eyepiece. Try moving your eye in and out until you find it.|`|mVPBkUWSaa	When you figure it out, tell me. I always have a problem with that. Then again, I'm also completely incapable of using binoculars properly. It might be possible that you and I are too close to the lens and catching a reflection.
XrH3y9Agaa	If you are asking just to view, you can borrow from the library. If there's anything you would like to study further, take note. <br>  <br>  As simple as that. As you know the book has its copyright so unless someone (or you) dare to scan the whole book and save it in your thumb drive for future use. Frankly, they can never control to that extent as the technology nowadays is well ahead. You can even use your mobile phone to grab a picture of a brain structure for example on the book and get it very clearly (with phone mega pixels 3.0 or above I am sure). <br>  <br>  But some people really prefer to "hold a book" when it comes to study. So you may wanna consider to <br>  1) shop for it at a 2nd hand bookshop<br>  2) put notice asking for a cheaper price of the book<br>  3) borrow from a friend who like to collect books (i do have those kind of friends so it is possible)<br>  4) ask someone who have the book if you can pay a little money and share with him/her for sometime.<br>  5) go for an older version in the library as people tend to look for the latest version and you might be able to borrow the book for a very long time since no one recall that particular book. Sometimes there's only slight changes made in the new version so it might be a good idea. <br>  <br>  Hope it helped.<br>  <br>  Cheers.
i4ThsyUCaa	In humans, there are 46 chromosomes in a body cell. A process called meiosis makes sure that when a gamete is made, the sperm or the egg cell each only has 23 chromosomes, half of the original number, so that when they join to form a zygote when fertilization occurs, the zygote will have a total of 46 chromosomes, like every cell in a human does. So the answer is 23.<br>  <br>  Depending on the species of the organism, however, the number of chromosomes in a gamete will vary. <br>  <br>  Please click the following link for a diagram. It's not labelled, but the green string is the sperm and the blue circle is the egg cell.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www-biology.ucsd.edu/classes/bimm110.SP07/images/fertilization2.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www-biology.ucsd.edu/classes/bimm...</a>|`|CpQdjc4raa	Human = 23 in each sperm or egg for a total of 46 when combined.|`|CYtMRC4eaa	You can't tell  how many chromosomes are in a gamete unless you know how many chromosomes are in a somatic cell.

You might be much better off talking to the professor and seeing if he can recommend any other texts that have more examples in them that you can read up on.  Old homework and exam questions and solutions can also be helpful as examples to work through, and professors often make them available for studying anyway, so you might be able to get some.
Ftkr9jqYaa	Almost every plant cell should contain at least some glucose, DNA, proteins, lipids, starch, and cellulose.<br>  <br>  Cellulose is the structural component of the primary cell wall of plants, and is the most common organic compound on Earth. About 33 percent of all plant matter is cellulose.<br>  <br>  Lipids, in the form of glycerophospholipids, are the main structural component of membranes, such as the cellular plasma membrane, and the intracellular membranes of organelles.  In plants, the galactosyldiacylglycerols and sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerol, which lack a phosphate group, are important components of membranes of chloroplasts and related organelles, and are the most abundant lipids in photosynthetic tissues.<br>  <br>  Photosynthesis plants use light energy to produce GLUCOSE from carbon dioxide. The glucose is stored mainly in the form of STARCH granules, in plastids such as chloroplasts and especially amyloplasts. <br>  <br>  Proteins are abundant in plant cells, and participate in almost every process within cells. Many proteins are enzymes that catalyze biochemical reactions and are vital to metabolism. Proteins also have structural functions, and compose the cytoskeleton.<br>  <br>  Plants store DNA in chromosomes inside the cell nucleus, as do all Eukaryotic organisms (animals, plants, fungi, and protists).
lMN59lv2aa	Most animal cells spend the longest amount of time in G1, so the answer is (B). However, S is not far behind.<br>  <br>  A typical mammilian somatic cell spends about 42% of the cycle in G1, 38% in S, 16% in G2, and 4% in M.
