AleWgjvPaa	The chapel where I got married only had candles and it looked amazing. Leave the other lights off and it'll be fine. <br>  <br>  Couldn't you ask the pastor or priest if you could "borrow" the church one day and light all that are there and see what it looks like?|`|2324ca2619e6dee826826d027a6a3effaa	If you really want flowers, this is what I did and it worked AWESOME!<br>  <br>  I went to a few local florists and asked them what they did with their flowers that they couldn't get rid of before the weekend. If they said they threw them away, I asked if I could buy them cheap or have them for free. I picked up the flowers on Saturday afternoon and made the arrangements myself (with the help of two of my sisters). I was never charged one cent and got TONS of flowers.<br>  <br>  You just have to be willing to put in the time/effort of going to the florists and making the arrangments yourself, but it was worth it!<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|rpVQpJA7aa	If the lighting is dim, you will be definitely ok, just make sure it doesn't get too dark in the church. Maybe test it out ahead of time...put a couple candles in the church, light them and turn the lights off.|`|ETHdEtPQaa	i'm sure candles would be beautiful! it promotes a romantic atmosphere, which is always good for a wedding. if you want to buy a bunch go to candle4less.com. they do bulk orders mainly so you get the most for your dollar. hope it turns out beautiful for you!|`|xuiSfzgraa	I think the candles would be ok, even during the day.  They are very romantic, and I think even if you left the lights on they would still stand out and be very beautiful...Also if you check with the church maybe you could just have a few of the lights on for a dimmer look...And I think that more people would notice the candles in the window more then they would notice the flowers.
bdSm8Mi6aa	I don't understand this, is she not pregnant?  Why on earth would you want to have a baby now?  Aren't there things you want to accomplish in life?  High school, college, a career, a bank account w/ more than $100?<br>  <br>  If you are asking people on yahoo answers than no you shouldn't have baby.  Do  yourself, me, and the rest of society a favor and ask your parents and your girlfriend's, excuse me, fiance's parents what their thought is on this subject.  If you're afraid to tell them or don't want to hear their answer than you are too young and too stupid to have a child.<br>  <br>  Seriously in this economy why would you want a child if you are uneducated, have no place of your own, with no money?  You'll be homeless in seconds.<br>  <br>  Also, if you're so afraid of "messing up"  (wow you're so immature you can't even say something like if the condom breaks {pls tell me ur using a condom}) Don't have sex. Please use a condom, and tell her to go on birth control.  It's called planned parenthood for a reason, kid.|`|Wv592rOqaa	The answer to having a child while you both have not finished your formal education is NO!  It would be a selfish act – children are expensive little people waiting to grow up in well balanced homes that offer them comfort and a chance at life.  <br>  <br>  The low average of raising a child is about 55,000 per year – sit down and be real – if you do not have health insurance – who is going to pay for the mother’s doctor visits?  What if the mom has special needs, like blood monitoring or other tests, and having a baby in a city or county hospital is about 7, 000 for girls and 10,000 for boys (boys cost more).  <br>  <br>  Factor in diapers, clothes, childcare while you work.  Babies come with a ton of germs so they get sick a lot while young - who is going to take off work and who will pay for the doctor's visit.  <br>  <br>  There are NO mistakes in getting your girlfriend pregnant if she uses birth control responsible it won’t happen until you are both ready.  Why not be each others baby for the next 4 years and then think about it again.  If you are in college by then, wait some more years.<br>  <br>  Having children together will not keep you together or prove that you love each other – However, it could make your lives more complicated and stressful and some innocent little baby life chaotic and hectic --- <br>  <br>  Children should not just happen, they should be planned.  Couples that are secure and love each other would never want to have children by chance and see what happens - puppysit, if you cannot take care of a puppy - you are not nearly ready for a baby.|`|uuMCGT9taa	good luck|`|9t1taTCtaa	Ok if she is not pregnant yet than you should wait till you graduate high school at least. It would be good for both, now if she is already prego than you should have the baby, cause it is not the baby's fault. Make the good choice|`|7KZOOkYYaa	If you need opinions from total strangers or anyone for that matter about having children, the fact is, you shouldn't be having a child. If you arent even sure, its not fair to your child.|`|y9TvRvs6aa	Wait til you've finished school - it would be really selfish to have a child now.|`|kjcybCOvaa	depends on how old you are? and i f you and he wants to and will stay with you???|`|nxjs5QoTaa	just ont have sex till ur redy i no its hard but come on u cun do it|`|A1KwOUFCaa	I don't think you have a baby because if you don't even know what's going to happen to your relationship then I wouldn't bring a baby in the world thinking he/she will bring you guys close together. Alot of people make that mistake, they have a baby thinking he/she will solve the problem. <br>  <br>  Just think about it, what if you guys do have a baby and then it dosent turn out for the 2 of you, what will happen to the baby? Your baby will need both his mom and dad, not just one at a time. <br>  <br>  I think first you should figure things out between the 2 of you and then think of bringing a baby into this world.|`|Kk9f3MdRaa	if you are coming on yahoo answers to ask if you should have a kid...then chances are no, you should not.<br>  <br>  Definitely don't have a kid in high school. I know you probably think it's no big deal, but it is! It might seem cool to be a 17 year old dad, but you will never go out again. Never be able to hang with your friends. Never buy anything for yourself. Have to live with your parents for the next 10 years or get a REALLY major dump of a place to live for you and your GF. Don't even think about college because you will be too busy working 3 jobs to pay for your kid and all his needs.
Y5IUse1vaa	This is the second question that I have noticed from you tonight. I think that you look like a young man, maybe fifteen and you are very attractive. You seem to need re-assurance in this department. Don't worry, you will be a girlie magnate!! If my neice were to see your picture, she would be getting in touch with you immediately!!! Are you naturally blonde?? If so, don't change your hair, it suits you very well.|`|9wSayIDwaa	I didn't even look at the picture...I just want 2 more points|`|XBYiHaWIaa	You look nowhere near 13 lol<br>  i'd say 17 too...but not quite 18.<br>  <br>  =P|`|cCESUnuvaa	you look about 16|`|3OmYQT1Maa	No, you look your age.

If this is for divorce check with your lawyer and they can tell you how long you have to attempt to contact this person before the court will determine that you have made a real effort.|`|Po1QAWTnaa	you can find almost anything on the web!!! they charge but its not expensive like 20.00.

Makes me feel like I am the only one out there for him!! ?<br>  When we are holding hands, he strokes my hand with his thumb, a subtle way to say that he loves/likes me<br>  He isnt afraid to show a little PDA<br>  all my friends like him and he likes all of them<br>  <br>  The only thing I dont like about him, is that I havent known him for more than 2 years!!

a3422bad6666b60894e80bace0f14387aa	Find an all-inclusive resort. That way you can lay by the pool and it will cost less. Look for deals at Orbitz, YahooTarvel, Expedia, Hotels.com, etc.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|ETHdEtPQaa	well depending on when you get married you could go to a national park. you have beautiful views and awesome hiking. that way you don't have to lounge around a pool ;). i love yosemite national park in california, but my honeymoon is going to be in grand lake colorado next to the rocky mountain national park! hope you can find a place you'll two enjoy!|`|w1necKzYaa	This all depends on where you live! and what you like to do! if you like shows and dancing and stuff like that go to vegas! if you like scenery and nature go to canada BC or newfoundland! if you like swimming and te ocean go to somewhere like I dunno miami or something like that or just go on a fishing or hiking trip!|`|HJ0YTWjVaa	We are having our wedding/honeymoon in Jamaica at Breezes Runaway Bay resort.  The website is www.breezes.com. I have not been there, but I have a friend who has and I have read a ton of reviews. The resort is older in some places, but they have a new block of rooms with plunge pools. My friend said the room she said in was outdated, but was not there to hang out in the room. There are tons of activities drinking games, snorkeling, pool, beach, scuba diving, golf course, PJ party, Toga party, and much more. It is all inclusive and priced fairly. Good Luck!!|`|JCAgvgTxaa	Cannot decide on a honeymoon right now?  Don't have the money?<br>  <br>  Then don't have a big honeymoon.  No one says you must go to Europe, just for example.<br>  <br>  Spend one night in the most luxurious local hotel.  Save up your money, and take a longer honeymoon in a year.<br>  <br>  or . . . <br>  <br>  Search for a bed and breakfast inn in your state.<br>  <a href="http://www.bbonline.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bbonline.com/</a><br>  <br>  No one says you have to take a big, long honeymoon involving lots of travel . . . especially if you cannot afford to do so.  Stay close to home, and check out some local activities, restaurants, plays, sporting events, etc.|`|IZn53ePgaa	Disney World<br>  Cruise<br>  The Mountains (scenic train rides, white water rafting, tubing, hiking)<br>  A City like NYC<br>  Hawaii, Puerto Rico, Jamaica, go sight seeing and tons of activities<br>  Take a driving trip along the coast. I think California has this one highway that is beautiful. <br>  Go to Alaska|`|rRVzWFYZaa	Well, where are you at now, and what do you like to do, what's the budget, and how long do you want the trip to be?<br>  <br>  If you're in the US and not in CA, I think Napa Valley/San Fran/Monterrey would be beautiful to go to, and you'd be out doing stuff, not sitting on your butt.  Montreal is also beautiful and romantic.  <br>  <br>  For something a little warmer, the Yucatan peninsula of Mexico has beaches, but also has all the cool Mayan stuff.|`|rQlsLZ9Baa	Check out couples.com. They're all-inclusive, so you get a lot for your dollar. Also, they have packages (like adventure) that you can add for a little extra more. It might seem like a little more than some honeymoon packages but you get all your meals and stuff included. <br>  <br>  If couples.com isn't your thing, look for all-inclusive honeymoon packages in Mexico. Just stay away from the tourist magnets. By going to someplace less popular, like Costa Rica, you get the benefit of the adventure (jungle, ocean and culture), without the price you would pay for, say, Cancun. <br>  <br>  Best of luck!|`|F3i6UUKYaa	It depends on where you're starting from.<br>  <br>  My roommate stayed at a ski resort in Vermont off-season and they went wine tasting, etc. Or, Maine is beautiful in the Northeast. In Canada, try Toronto,Montreal, or Nova Scotia.<br>  <br>  If you want to try Europe, flights into London are the cheapest. My bf and I spent a week backpacking in London, Trieste (Italy), and Venice and spent $1,300 each on the entire trip.<br>  <br>  Napa valley in California? Sedona, Arizona?|`|AIrPtuDUaa	I really suggest taking a cruise if you two arent scared.  It's very relaxing and fun.  The cruises are usually all inclusive with many events for you to participate in and all the food and drinks you can stand.  You can even find some in your price range.  I would really recommend taking a cruise. Good luck and congrats!|`|rpVQpJA7aa	All inclusive resorts are great. You would probably like Miami, or Cabo, or a place like that

a3422bad6666b60894e80bace0f14387aa	My father was the best man for my brother. During his speech, he said that my brother picked up his new wife "on the corner like all the others" and kept her because "she did a good job with him". It was SO embarassing for everyone, my brother and his wife were motified and my dad didn't think he did anything wrong. Comparing the new bride to a hooker, nothing wrong with that, right?! That was pretty bad...<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|ifgzHzA3aa	Best Man Speech:  "Once you get on her, don't get off of her."<br>  (btw, the bride's aunt, who was a nun, was in the room)|`|2eoAqicdaa	Sorry I can't answer the question.... loving the answers tho!! :)|`|ge3meKYEaa	They were very religious and the brides mother gave a speech about "sitting on the throne"... now she was talking about Jesus and the throne of God but it took us none religious people a few mins to understand what she was talking about........and people were trying not to laugh....<br>  <br>  Just a sample-<br>  "There is going to be days both of you really to sit on that throne... both of you will fight over that throne... you'll do anything to be the first on that throne..."<br>  <br>  It was hysterical.<br>  <br>  Other then that- anything that goes over 5 mins.... UGH, I was at one wedding were they had a lot of family in the military and they read letter for each one- it would have been fine but the letters were like 10 pages and 5 people....plus the maid of honor was crying so hard you couldn't understand her.. thank god the bar was open.|`|AA11380378	Two years ago, it was not really the speech per se, but the amount of speeches.

Lay him right the first time and you can walk all over him for years." The bride's grandparents weren't very impressed. <br>  <br>  The other was when the minister made everyone (during the ceremony) stand up and promise to help the couple stay faithful to each other. All the men had to stand up and say "I do" when asked if they would help keep the groom from straying, and the women had to do the same for the bride. It was awkward.|`|itcErzwTaa	AT MY FRIENDS WEDDING, during the reception, the groom had sex with the maid of honor in the bathroom, and his mother in law walked in on them. the maid of honor was the brides twin sister!! when the bride found out of this incident, she was crying hysterical and confronted the groom. he was drunk and slapped her twice. the brides brothers saw this and stabbed the groom, and the groom and brides brother both went to jail. the bride filed for divorce the next day. i know it wasnt a speech, but i think it is worse than a speech lol!|`|e8EQviEXaa	I don't think that i'll actually answer your question but here is a speech that will make your wedding unforgettable. now just to let you know you must learn this by heart or it won't work lol.<br>  <br>     The groom took her by the hands, feelin-<br>  <br>  for the record, this isn't from any book!<br>  <br>     The groom took her by the hands, her sweet trembling hands. "Darling, though i have only known you for a small portion of your life," he started as he looked into her glistening eyes, "I have come to notice that you are the most beautiful women i have ever met in my life." he kissed her on the hand and got up. "I want you to know that, thought i may not be able to help it, i will look at other girls, not as them, but wishing that they were you, and as they look at me, they will wish that they could be in your shoes." The bride giggled. "You must understand that i will do anything, anything at all, to keep you...till death do us part."<br>     The groom shook out his body and the bride looked at him, "Wow, i feel like crap now." The groom looked at her asking why with his eyes. "You gave something so beautiful and all i have is this," she cleared her throat. <br>  <br>  "Roses are red, violets are blue, you gave a speech to me, now i to you," she laughed as the minister looked at her strangely enough to make a women ***** slap him. "Ummm...i love you, how should i say, lust you. we have been together for what...three years? and i want to say that i do honestly love you." the minister looked into the crowd and said,<br>     "Does anyone have a reason why these two should not be wed?"<br>     A short and stock woman walked up to plate and looked the groom dead in the eyes..."THAT'S THE SAME ******* THING YOU SAID TO ME!" Slapped him dead in the face, kicked him in the nuts, and after all that the minister was up there laughing his butt off.<br>     The bride, astounded and appalled, walked up to the groom and said, "Okay, now that i know what type of person you are..." she looked him dead in the eyes, just like with the woman before, and grabbed his head as if she were about to kiss him, and threw it up against the wall Knocking him to the ground. "*****, you don't mess with me!" she waved for the family to come up and all two-hundred and fifty members walked up onto the spot were the groom was and ordered a neat line.<br>     one by one the each kicked him in the gut. two-hundred and forty-eight times. when it finally came to little johnny's turn he bent down and looked him in the face. "I was hoping you were going to be my daddy." he lifted up his face and kissed him on the cheek. "And even though you are not, i will always love you. my family may want to kill me for not doing what we normally do, but i don't care." he got up and walked over to his family. "Mommy, can we go home?"<br>     The minister was laughing his *** off, rolling on te floor, and barely breathing...|`|vCZuh3oDaa	The ones where the maid of honor loses it.  I'm not talking about a quivering voice or a stray tear (that's fine)...

I think that's horrible, it ruined the wedding, the bride was crying and stuff. That's some bad speech.

TbENA08baa	I would take this very seriously. It's better to be prepared and found wrong, then dead somewhere for taking things too casually.<br>  First of all, you should never be anywhere alone or in a secluded place. And you should let others know, like someone at school like a teacher or counselor or even the police. Just to have it on record. Believe me, it's best to have things on file for many reasons.<br>  Ask your friends or family to walk with you and hiding with shades or a hoodie won't stop him.<br>  Be very careful and observant.

And here I mean BIG brothers, guys who could intimidate him?  It wouldn't hurt to have them follow you around for a while.

He should trust you if he is your b/f.|`|xCjUEiB3aa	I'm having a bit of a problem with the same situation. I personally would just tell my boyfriend straight out because there is not easier way of doing that. I think you should invite your boyfriend because HE IS YOUR boyfriend.

Personally im not that type of person to go out with another guy friend ESPECIALLY if its a guy! i mean coffee and lunch my boyfriend doesnt care BUT clubbing? really!!! i mean think about it would you like it if one of your old girlfriends became closer with your boyfriend and your boyfriend told you that she wants to take him clubbing? Would you be okay with it?|`|dYN0iHvyaa	Obviously you're free to do whatever you want. That said, do you really want to cause problems between you and your bf, or your bf and his friend? I've been in situations somewhat like this, and things ALWAYS go wrong. Go out with some girl friends, or invite a group with this friend.|`|YmOyrfn4aa	Maybe you could invite another person. Possibly a girl so this way you're boyfriend won't really be a jealous when you tell him. Or you could invite the girl and you're boyfriend if you don't think he's going to complain.|`|WlYAH0BWaa	You just answered your own question by typing up this question :) Tell him what you told us! Look him in the eyes and firmly reassure him that you care about him and only him, and that you really just do want to have fun. Remind him he can always talk to his friend about it, and he should trust you even more with a friend. If he can't trust you for something that simple, you might need to rethink this whole trust thing!
0hdo4WORaa	Just say 'wanna ****' unless your a total dog he'll have you on your back in.02 seconds|`|8JU1hxZ1aa	well he's picking you up at 12am to go to the beach.. chances are you're not going to have to do much for this to happen.<br>  <br>  I would suggest corset etc under a baggy top, then take the top off at the beach :)
8JU1hxZ1aa	Make it a group thing, much less of a date so be like hey yeah i'm free friday, we should see if any more of the old group can make it lol <br>  <br>  this will make it seem a lot less datey and more catchup/friendsy :)<br>  <br>  good luck|`|zYEfkwmxaa	if you don't want a relationship with him then zap him with a laser no just kidding just tell him you don't want a relationship
O9yERnVGaa	so you could say that... you're "jesse's girl"|`|zprAkP3eaa	Don't feel that way about yourself, maybe he goes for what's on the inside not the out, maybe he thinks you are really pretty.

Feel beatiful, and that's what counts. looks aren't it all. and so what if others whisper behind your backs? so what? it shouldnt matter what other people think. they're just jeolous. and honey, your like me, a bit paranoid. take a deep breath whenever you think that and tell yourself your exgagerating.|`|GxSnVRAOaa	"Jesse's Girl!"  I ******* love it!  <br>  <br>  Anyway, good for you!  You are probably a lot prettier than you think you are, get some self esteem, or you'll end up driving him away with your insecurities.|`|FZMBJAMpaa	Have any pictures? :]|`|vFldqvN4aa	HES NOT OUT OF YOUR LEAGUE IF HES DATING YOU AND LIKES YOU : )|`|Rq8YGaHAaa	Who cares what people think? As long as you're both happy together and don't mind, it's all good. :)|`|oPcpPH2paa	For so long if my relationship i thought that. I was constatnly worying about what other people thought and i had the same feelings you did.<br>   But what counts is not what other people think, but your own relationship. Pick yourself up. There is a reason he is with you he sees something that he doesn't see if the other girls. Be happy! HE picked you !  Tonight you need to make a list of why he would want to be with you, and heck if your brave enough, ask him! I did this in my relationship and my bf was surprised he felt like that. He assured me that he wanted me. SO make a list, talk to him, dont worry about what other people think.

28VCKqDIaa	well sweety she does obviously.<br>   <br>  but to tell you the truth idk why she rejected you three times!<br>  i guess maybe shes scared, nervous, . . . maybe.<br>  <br>  but maybe shes trying to get to know you MORE.<br>  but [maybe] eventually [in the future] yall hook up.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  ;)|`|GTKXq7A1aa	fo sho dude<br>  u have an admirer|`|0lK97zzVaa	I do sometimes, when I get really nervous around someone/ something! I think she likes you!|`|bYVsQKVZaa	ya when i like some1|`|D0E8oO0Naa	she's not ready|`|3QmTa4Cgaa	She may be confused at the moment about who to like or she just isn't interested if it looks like it. You see, I really don't like this kid who hangs out with my group and he is right annoying. 98% he likes me and I don't mean to look at him. I just look up and he is there. Or when I want to look somewhere or at someone, he has to be there. It can just be a coincidence. I mean I have it with this kid and it bugs the crap out of me. But if she rejects you, then most of the time shes not interested. Sorry.|`|6f8eb1df236b453d41b94b11467cd780aa	Yeah I've acted like dat. The girl is nervous. She isn't ready to be in a relationship, She's afraid to make a fool of herself in front of you. And is sort of she when she comes near you. Just flirt with her. Do something to make her come out of being so shy. Just like kiss her after class. And then ask her out. face to face. But flirt a whole damn week before kissin her. And make sure she getting comfortable with you. That's another think. She wants to comfortable with you before going out. So get her to be comfortable and do something stupid so it doesn't seem like she's the only one when she she says or does something stupid. ok that's all i have to say.|`|oNh9Av4aaa	omg i do the same thing  but i couldent sit next to or close to him because my friend used to like him so i really cant make a move so im waiting for him and if you like her that is a hint that you should make your move Hope this Helps Good luck with the girl<br>   ~Ally<br>  <br>  i would get her alone and ask her whats up maybe her parents wont let her date idk|`|YIJRZhoSaa	just study hard and hard, and you will forget everything.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.doreplica.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.doreplica.com</a>|`|ZGVZI3CBaa	Try asking her directly how she feels about your friendship. Sometimes it saves you a lot of time spent worrying by just working up the guts to confront something directly.|`|8Zjf61EZaa	I think she's slightly flirting with you so you should wait and see if it progresses to something more ok but Yes i think you should ask her out.|`|mtI3R2FWaa	hmm. <br>  im not a guy..<br>  but from a girls prospective<br>  shes prolly trying to make you jealous and making you even like her more : /<br>  <br>  good luck[:|`|6MPTPYDOaa	it sounds like she likes you, but she might not be ready for a relationship|`|ZdWYaeE6aa	sorry but she's a lez|`|D2dfbRypaa	she likes u shes playin hard to get|`|8rxHq01Oaa	okay guy shes o v e r  you and <br>  shes probably into someone else <br>  maybe shes tired of you not catching the hints and moved on. its a common thing and you need to get over it.|`|9YYGCIX5aa	um i think its that shes scared you wont like her so shes acting like that and she's nervous and is scared thats what i  think other ppl might think differently|`|W4HNrbXvaa	Yes! I bet she does. You do have yourself a problem though. You should confront her about it. Honesty is the best policy. Tell her what you noticed and let her know you really like her. Tell her you're willing to wait for her (if you are) and then you can really see how she feels.<br>  <br>  -Hope this helps :]|`|ijLewIjnaa	OK dude, she totally likes you.  It's great how you're a boy but you picked up all these little flirting aspects of girls.  I'm not sure any guy can get any more evidence that.  My suggestion would be to make a move!  What have you got to lose?  She's obviously interested in you and not in any other boy if those guys had already made a move and she is still single today.  Best of luck dude! Lis|`|vJyxbcABaa	i hav done tht b4!! <br>  idk know y really but  i think it was because i just wanted attention from him, so i chose a weird way to get it. like i wanted him to notice tht i ignore him out of everyone else when we are in a crowd and i wud just stare at him and let him catch me staring, then look away! she likes u! shes just nervous...i bet she sits around and thinks about what she can do next to get you to ask her out again so she can say yes...HOPEFULLY...lolz i hope my answer makes sense.|`|GNkR9R8baa	First this boy asked me out and i said no like 3 times. I'm not sure if she likes you or not. I get nervous when i talk to him because it feels weird. I play with my hair and try to make a wall between us and try not to look at him. Or as much as I try to avoid him I always seem to look his way or spot him out from everyone. She probably doesn't want to be mean to you. <br>  Or she does like you because she wants to be hard to get. She doesn't want to play it easy because everyone likes a challenge. It depends on the girl and what ever she does. Although if she asked for your help in the word then she probably does like you.|`|OBuzcIDbaa	It definitely sounds like she enjoys your attention and the fact that you like her. That doesn't necessarily mean that she will go out with you.<br>  My guess is that she is young and not sure how to handle relationships with the opposite sex?|`|ww3ukbdVaa	yes, she does, why dont you ask her?|`|7CjF3Y7uaa	1) she likes you but she's too shy to admit it, so she treats you this way. <br>  2) she doesn't like you, but she likes the fact that you pay attention to her. <br>  3) she likes you, but she's not really interested in a relationship right now (not sure if she rejected those other guys?) so she gives you the hint she notices you, but she doesnt want to be close with you. <br>  4) everything may just be coincidence O_o <br>  <br>  haha. those are my 4 thoughts X]|`|9YM0whxLaa	nahhh<br>  she may like you<br>  but if youve asked her and she said no i dount it(unless she has a bf then thats totally diff. she prolly likes you)<br>  maybe shes looking at you cuz you look at her<br>  i mean i hope it works out for you!!<br>  =]|`|t043WEDIaa	i acted almost the exact same way around a guy last year who i wanted to be friends with but it was so awkward because he told me he liked him. i didn't want to lead him on at all but i wanted to be friends with him. i honestly don't think she's that into you, sorry bud
AvmKTcJNaa	It sounds to me that you aren't necessarily upset about what he watches but how long.<br>  <br>  I know this can be a far away from now but where do you want this relationship to end up? Is it just for fun or are you hoping it will lead to marriage and stuff? If he's not spending time with you now then how will it be when you guys have children? Would he even spend time with them?<br>  <br>  I would just talk to him and let him know you guys need more things to do as a couple. That he doesn't need to necessarily stop watching his channels but he dose need to devote more time to you. Otherwise you guys will drift apart and you'll end up feeling like you're roommates that either have extra benefits or use to sleep together.
nLiCiRnSaa	I think its more of the idea of you that she's missing.|`|Ut5fUAhwaa	it's a girl thing. get over her and find someone new to make memories with. duh!

AA11510145	YES she definitely broke the girl code. It doesn't matter if this happened to a kid or an adult, the bottom line is it's wrong! Your friend should have known better so question if this is someone you want to call a "best friend" any longer. You should say something to her even though she will have a million reasons why she thinks it was ok and she will say you are making a big deal about nothing. I'm an adult and not really into all that drama stuff but this would make me mad if my friend did this.|`|D0E8oO0Naa	No, if a person loves someone theres<br>  really nothing you can do about it, but<br>  yeah she does like him by flirting and<br>  saying he is cute and stuff.|`|lvXZaom6aa	Let me guess... Your in 8th grade? I know im right. and... what do YOU think you should do? Cuz you are probably right. Dont get on yahoo answers and ask a stranger...confront the chick.|`|NYw0o97Maa	that guys' a player. FORGET HIM.|`|RZJLLxnUaa	what girl code? we have one?<br>  lol you chould confront her, but be nice about it|`|buYhmffxaa	the whole thing at the end about how he respects you is obviously not true cuz he went behind your back and went out with another girl, seriously, your not gonna find "the one" in highschool or whatever. I've dated guys in highschool, and it really never works out, trust me.   <br>  But besides the point, if i were you i would ditch the friend, she obviously wasnt that good of a friend if she did that to you.. and get new friends, and just forget about the guy, theres always more fish in the sea.|`|ucfR5uHwaa	remember to think about BEING a good friend before you worry about how good your friend is being to YOU.<br>  <br>  you liked him a lot because he's a great guy. so what makes you think she wouldnt like him just as much?<br>  <br>  teenage girls KNOW that we can't help who we have a thing for, you know?<br>  <br>  it's not her fault, she just wants to get her chance- don't blame her!|`|t043WEDIaa	he's not respecting you, he's keeping you until summer when he gets bored of the girl he's with now...sorry harsh but he doesn't really sound like a catch to me<br>  and i think if you didn't specifically talk to her about it then she's not breaking the girl code or whatever.|`|MKWkPH2vaa	That kind of thing can happen at any age, it is more common in the younger age group, but that kind of drama happens all the time. In fact it can continue for the rest of your life unless you choose to remove yourself from it. One thing to remember, as bad as it, most people are only out for themselves. Your wants or your feelings will hardly ever be considered, only their own. I learned a long time ago that it is not worth your time or effort. If I were you, I would still be friends and nice to everyone, but I definitely would not talk to that guy anymore. Sounds like a player to me, not worth it.|`|9cPNA4nKaa	Confront, Cat-fight, Cry<br>  the 3 C's of resolution|`|JjS4ARPYaa	You need to talk to her, and him if thats possible.|`|8dnwrn1Vaa	Ok.|`|8ca486a3b81d2d6b3cb2a798e704148daa	ah girl. Im honestly in your position right now! be upfront about it, because obviously shes a little more close to him than just "friends". confront her and if she dosnt respect it then shes just not a good friend. Thats messed up and i deff dont think you should give that one guy a chance as well! Goodluck girl, and just stay true to yourself, dont ever let anyone get the best of you, whether its that guy or you so called bestfriend. :)
8JU1hxZ1aa	imo, depending on how together you too were, i loved being single after breaking up with my boyfriend, except for at nights... i missed rolling over and having someone there. That made me miss him/the relationship...|`|O9yERnVGaa	she knows his dick is a lot bigger than yours
iU1yT9LXaa	you dont wanna be stuck in the friend zone...just be there for her, improve urself and when she sees that u're better than u were when yall were dating, she'll want you back!
XH2o1MM6aa	.Not a brilliant idea to shower someone with gifts and expect nothing in return.He'll think your trying to "buy" him. Stand back and let him spend some of his money.In fact insist that he does so (spend money).
yd4bTuWOaa	This is a horrible situation because youre being hated over stupid lies. Theres not really anything to do being that she must be so gullable to believe anyone she sees. Try to talk to her you wouldnt want her to dislike you and try to convince your boyfriend youre not the one. communication goes along way your ex is a jelous fool who needs to stop being so dumb
XH2o1MM6aa	.Princess a visit to the local library could work wonders.A good book is a treasure.I know how lonely you feel and reading not only engages your thoughts,imagination, concentration but it makes you tired.So you sleep easier.

Maybe get your friend to do something so they can think about other things, it will help them cope with it.
fF64LOHQaa	If you don't know her very  well, Just simple things like saying Hi, it shows that you care for her.  Ask her how she is, and what she did over the weekend.  Give her compliments make  her feel special but DON'T over do it.  Give her the opportunity to start a conversation sometimes.  And then once you get to know her better, maybe ask what her number is.. Its really simple!

Ask the girl out already nimrod!!! 2) He does|`|yKLBdoigaa	Yes you need to tell him that it is your girl, and he should not have to worry about her. Be honest, say it does bother you a little bit. I hang out with my bestfriend's girlfriend, but he is usually there. We text to hang out as a group, never just some random "hey are you okay?" types of texts.<br>  <br>  It sounds like your friend is trying to look good in front of her, and try to possibly steal or line her up for when you guys break up. Just ask for some space.|`|DNOe4lD3aa	no you sound like you full of yourself and maybe he is trying to protect her from your stupid mind thinking that way look if you like this girl you should care because you should know that she wouldn't go behind you back and cheat on you and you are a fu@king retarded!!!!!!|`|MsLKIJWJaa	it is possible but I might be wrong. <br>  Maybe he just cares about her a lot.

IZ7u47SEaa	i don't think you should be so nervous! haha if he admitted that he liked you via text its obviously based on your personality rather than your looks. if it's the other way around then he's not worth your time.<br>  <br>  when you're with him try not to be shy. just make conversation with him. guys usually like to see confidence in girls. possibly try talking to him about your friends, school, simple things. if it gets really awkward tell him you have to go to the bathroom and you'll be right back. while your gone it can give both of you a chance to think of something else to talk about. find something fun to laugh about too. it can be a really good ice breaker|`|4530909ace1591a0506a6b2a66761934aa	<br><br>it works  <a href="http://www.real-wishes.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.real-wishes.com</a><br><br>|`|vJvwYDGTaa	The best thing you can do is just dont even think about it! If you keep going over in your head that your not good enough, your just gonna convince yourself more and more. <br>  <br>  As for the night when you meet him. <br>  If he really doesnt like you because of your looks than obviously hes not worth it. I know you dont wanna hear that, and you want it to work out, but thats reality. And most of the time we are our worst critics. Especially girls. we always think we're not good enough, pretty enough, skinny enough... honestly its all crap! <br>  <br>  Something that can always be good for someone was has a lack of words, is by saying stuff by how you look and dress. LOOK HOT. I mean dont look like a complete ****, because that would just give him the wrong impression. But i mean wear a sexy top, curve hugging jeans, some makeup, and hair! Most guys just want a girl who knows how to take care of herself and look good, so do that and Im sure you'll be fine!|`|JMs4RDVxaa	i've been there, done that a million times. trust me, it never turns out as badly as you think. he's probably worrying the same thing, that he won't look as good in person or whatever. i would tell him that you're nervous about _____ and he'll probably give you some sort of reassurance. and if you're quiet, that's okay, don't plan out what you're going to say; if there's chemistry it'll work :)|`|BSlVGJ62aa	Don't be. Be yourself and if he does not like you it is his loss. It also does not matter what you look like. If you act normal and smile a lot you will be just fine. Your only thing to worry about is if you posted a picture that does not look like you at all. That would bring up the question in his mind: Do I really want a dishonest girlfriend? Every thing will be okay and if he does not like you in person there are many other guys out there.

Early teens. It was with a boy a year or two older. We had been dating for a few months. His parents went out for dinner and we decided to try it without even talking about it first. It was pretty bad - I didn't like it or really feel comfortable.|`|0hdo4WORaa	Define 'sex'. Does include auto-eroticism (doing it in a car), fantasy, a dry ****, karezz. It's a flexible term|`|g71m3S9Naa	16 in my car and it stunk to high heaven.  I parked behind a meeting hall.  She climbed on top and OMG!  It lasted about 10 minutes, she had an orgasm and I was left with a hard on.  Went to a buddies house after I dropped her off and I washed myself off with a garden hose.   Took a week to get the smell out of my car.

F3LBgfvwaa	Try bending your knees out to the sides so your feet are at your sides, pointing outward. You have to be sort of flexible though. If that doesn't work, have them out in front of you, with your feet at the sides of your bf's head. :)|`|nAH87QqVaa	stratle him its much easier|`|3fMK5moxaa	Try turning around so you've got your back to him so your riding him backwards, you can hold on to his legs for support,<br>   my boyfriend love this.<br>  Or watch some pron, and see how the pro's do it.<br>  But its always a bit harder for a girl to ride cause we've got to open our legs at the same time.|`|8JU1hxZ1aa	basically, kneel over him, so fold your legs up on either side, facing him :)<br>  <br>  or for something more fun, spin around so you're facing is feet ^_^|`|mjy4oRvDaa	Like you're riding a horse, only instead of letting your legs hang down, you pull them back as if you were kneeling.|`|AA12321156	heres' a better solution: be absitnent!!<br>  <br>  [thats pretty sad if you don't know what that means (being a vigrin, in cade you didn't)]|`|1VCxckdUaa	how about u on top of him?<br>  u know, lay him down and you sit on top<br>  or u can try side way, just open your leg and have him behind you.<br>  did he on top when u face down or face up, you can try face down to.<br>  good luck|`|JMs4RDVxaa	pretend like you're riding a horse lolololol|`|B15LRzApaa	do doggy style =]|`|aErUKUvVaa	uhm.... over his?  cummon......

rJR0puvmaa	just go up to him and tell  him that you like him.  hes probably to shy to  talk to you, so if you dont make a move most likely nothing will come out of it and you two will just stare at eachother for the rest of your school days
1a8da3900278db87f090619373273087aa	beauty is in the eye of the beholder,.....|`|F89MNQheaa	Someone who doesnt judge on face value? Who actually cares what the personality is like.|`|XT81GCu1aa	I've seen this, and also the other way around (two people who clearly don't "go" together.)  Usually they are with each other for the same reasons as someone else, they like each other's personalities or other qualities.  Hopefully.  Or one might be using the other for something (ie money), but that can happen in any relationship.|`|J14tPA9Eaa	why do you care <br>  <br>  you women ***** at us for being shallow and only going after beautiful women and when we date a girl that might not be as beautiful you still ***** at us...<br>  <br>  thats why i dont give **** what anyone thinks anymore i make the rules|`|lIO4uiJmaa	you dont often see it that way round - although you often see attractive women with ugly men - I think men are more shallow when it comes to appearances|`|BlA60kDVaa	I only date beautiful minds.  They are very rare, nowadays.|`|dCPH9pGgaa	What a ridiculous question.<br>  You obviously do get the shallow people who think it is ok to judge people on looks, but then hopefully you get the other kind too!<br>  <br>  Beauty isn't the be all and end all of life, especially in relationships.|`|t6tPgDnKaa	don't get mad about it.... the person doesn't see if that man or woman it's ugly or not... they just fall in love or see the person's charmed.....<br>  the love it's not shalow... the fisical beauty only last for three months|`|l9bNCR6maa	no im a ugly woman and i get ugly men
hGWhzfFqaa	Confront your friend about it, and if he did then give him time to tell his girlfriend, about a couple days, and if he doesn't then you need to tell her.<br>  <br>  Answer mine please?<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090309180618AAjErJv">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|syLCg7f3aa	I know you want to help, but stay out of it! Do not talk to his girlfriend about this...believe me you will somehow end up being the "bad guy". If anything, talk to the friend that you think is doing the cheating. Tell him that you don't want to be involved in this, and to keep it out of your vision.|`|O9yERnVGaa	sleep with him as well|`|GxSnVRAOaa	Lol, I love you Ron!  Anyway, don't sleep with him...don't do anything.  Stay out of it, so many friends liking one guy sounds a lot like middle school/early high school...no adult woman and her friend engage in that type of drama amongst themselves.  Just stay out of it, it will all blow over and it's not worth the immature drama and hurting people's feelings.|`|QHnS31Scaa	i know you want to be a good friend but its not your bisness to get involved
366q2mlUaa	find someone else to concentrate on, show him your not gonna wait around for him, and if he really wants you, he'll straighten out.|`|4530909ace1591a0506a6b2a66761934aa	<br><br>it works  <a href="http://www.real-wishes.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.real-wishes.com</a><br><br>|`|B1RVJOBcaa	Try focussing on something else?<br>  Umm a school team?<br>  Club's?<br>  Friends?
RnQFwIuUaa	No, I don't think that would be good. It's kind of like middle school romance. Why don't you take the time to talk to her. Ask her if she thought the homework was hard or if she belongs to whatever club at school. Look at her backpack and notebook and see if she has any stickers or patches. This will give you a clue to what she is into. Then after she feels comfortable with you and likes talking to you, she will be ready to accept an invitation from you. Good luck|`|ZjM0ghSnaa	Well, im 16, but I dont act like one of those teenagers if you know what im talking about...<br>  <br>  I think thats cute! If I got a note like that, I'd be suprised and happy at the same time. It's not every day that you get a creative note like that:)|`|ISMColXfaa	That's pretty cute, but I think face-2-face would be the best. It shows you're confident and friendly.|`|nLiCiRnSaa	Its kind of elementary school.... the boxes I mean|`|I4fPvsr6aa	sounds like grade school. A girl likes a man with confidence who can walk up to her and talk to her like its no problem.|`|Yz1pzloSaa	Lol. Depends on if I liked the guy enough, I guess. I think the 3 boxes was dumb and girly though.<br>  I'm 15 though, sorry :P|`|ubC1reIraa	super cute!! reminds me of the song, Check Yes or No - George Strait
wqRwSaGSaa	shes to young to date,<br>  but when yall are older the age difference wouldnt be bad.<br>  im 16 and my fiances 20.|`|0hdo4WORaa	Jaibait alert!!!! & she's a ****|`|Ze25ovEiaa	dude.. sorry, but she is too young. <br>  not necessarily too young to date, but too young to date you. <br>  she's still a kid.. shes not even a teenager yet!<br>  seriously.. i would not recommend it.. its not the fact that you're 2 years apart.. but the fact that you're 15 and she's 12. <br>  it would be a different story if you guys were a bit older, cuz the older you are the less significant age gaps seem to be. but at the moment, shes a kid and you're not, which means you two are at different stages in life. <br>  rethink dating someone younger when you're 17 and she's turning 15.|`|F5Yb7PDvaa	depends how mature she is i guuess. if you have alot of relationship, dating, or sexual differences then i wouldnt go for it, but if you seem like your on the same page then its fine :) alot of guys date younger and girls date older.|`|hGWhzfFqaa	She is a little young to start dating, but no it's not a big deal. Just like a 22 year old and a 24 year old wouldn't be a big deal. Go for it ;)|`|Rq8YGaHAaa	Sorry, but... she's too young to date. Haha.<br>  <br>  And she's especially too young to date someone older.|`|qoev9aNFaa	I say go for it! Age is nothing but a number.|`|yJKJBl9Maa	i think you should go for it! it doesent matter if she is 12
X4i2jej5aa	My guy friend had the same problem after he got dumped (horrible experience for me and him because he is like my brother and he made the experience of being dumped sound so horrible). When he said, "i think you should stay away", i think he means that he's scared that you are going to hurt him again and he really likes you. So if you guys are going out, he's scared of being hurt by you. And when he tries to throw that thought away, he knows how much he can't stay away from you. Try giving him more time to think about this. Tell him you want him to really think this situation over before he asks you out, if you like him back, tell him you would wait. If you would really wait for his answer though, because if you can't, then don't say that. ;)|`|e2f58b14df9f236c1bd340d61f7163d0aa	He probably does like you, but maybe he's saying that he doesn't want a girlfriend because he's afraid you'll say no. Either he really wants to be your friend or he like you because he wouldn't tell you personal problems if he didn't care about you. So I say just be friends for now and see where that goes.|`|jFwKyjT8aa	it sounds like he's trying to play hard to get. he's playing games, trying to see if you'll play along. he's also trying to sound all dangerous and mysterious to impress you. lol i remember that fun stuff from middle school/high school. he definitely likes you! go with it:)|`|gAUbaMGVaa	yea those are some mixed signals alright.<br>  well he likes you for sure, but even if alot of bad stuff has been happening to him lately he still wants to hangout with you. maybe you can change his bad luck for him.<br>  good luck my dear! :)|`|iocCNTUqaa	Guys can be SUPER confusing sometimes. There's nothing wrong with just hanging out and having a good time. You don't have to jump into a relationship right away. He obviously likes you, just sit down and talk to him about and figure out what he really wants. He may not be ready for a relationship, if you respect that, he'll respect you in return.|`|sOKi2EE9aa	i think he  himself doesn't  know what he wants..and in those situations you should kinda find out what his intentions are they don't seem good to me|`|AA11617792	it sounds like he doesnt know what to say when he is around you.. this usually means he likes you :)|`|wrEKaaGlaa	hes totally falling for you! cant you see he cant stand not being with you but he knows it might hurt you if u hang! he wants whats best for you! omg this is sooooo cute!!!!!! its like one of those things that only happens in movies! awwww|`|syLCg7f3aa	He sounds like an emotional basket case! I know you don't want to...you want to be there for him and "help" him. But, he is trying to show you and warn you of who he is...so believe him. He is trying to for-warn you of the fact that he isn't a great person, or at least he doesn't think so. So, there for if you choose to date him...if things go bad between you or he treats you badly...he's in the clear because he "warned" you of how he is. And he will always throw that in your face, and tell you that it was your choice. Don't waste your energy honey.
fFnfFROQaa	If you get into a relationship with a girl, do you mind if she dances with other guys in front of you?<br>  <br>  If you are OK with that, then she might be OK with you dancing with other girls.
Qbczt3ivaa	I think if you dont know this girl too well, you should probably at least try to get to know her a little better. If you confess too early, she might be uncomfortable and not ready.(my opinion) But if you decide to do it anyway, I would meet her/go up to her somewhere alone(maybe after work when she is going to her car?) It can be wherever you want, just as long as you are confident and relaxed, it doesnt matter where. <br>  <br>  Good Luck!<br>  <br>  Sara

Looks are not the most important by any means. If you are attracted to someones personality then you will automatically think they are cute.|`|RnQFwIuUaa	I do have to be attracted to you, but that can be be after I get used to you and your personality. So, I guess, you have to look decent, have good hygiene, etc. for me to pay attention to you, but, as I find I like talking to you, I become attracted to you. I hope that makes sense.

He is doing the same thing that he did with you. He probably gets bored after a month when things start to not be so exciting.<br>  <br>  2) You may want to look at why your Dad didn't like him & learn from that.<br>  <br>  3) If your BF is a true friend, you 2 will get together again when he is gone or she wises up. Just call or text her & say that men are not worth a friendship. <br>  <br>  4) When ever you think of him just imagine a big red X over his face.

AA10370707	I think you belong. I will never completely understand why people have problems with homosexuals, because I think that it is wonderful, and that gay or lesbian people are generally more happy than heterosexual people. I am straight, but have lots of gay friends, who I love dearly, and I ask people why they think that it is bad for people to be gay and they tell me that its gross, or so messed up or something along those lines. I think that if you are comfortable with your sexuality, then you should frown upon those who think less of people who are different than them. Because really? All they are is jealous :)

The cars must be parked out where they can be seen.<br>  <br>  - Losers will pose for pictures in whatever positions winners put them in and wearing whatever the winners stipulate including just their birthday suits<br>  <br>  - Losers will cook and serve dinner to winners each night of the weekend dressed as winners command.|`|rsDtptvkaa	If the guys lose have them shave their bodies and be totally hairless then dress them in the skimpiest speedos you can find and have them go to the beach with you.<br>  <br>  If the girls lose make them go to a store and buy jock straps then wear them while they do the guys laundry and cook meals.

8a2XXsnzaa	Wow, maybe he is the flirtatious type of boy. I had a similar case in high school I really like this boy for an entire year, who would flirt a lot, but I realized later on that it was just his way of being. Funny in college when I outgrew my ugly duckling years and braces were off, he tried to ask me out....and I was like "i don't think so". Anyhow, maybe that's how he is, plus he is getting annoy of these text messgs. so quit that and don't act desperate guys hate that, take it from a married woman, even husbands hate that. Act more serious, ignore him sometimes and other times smile at him as if you are flirting, than ignore him the next day! you'll drive him crazy, maybe he will let you know if he likes you than. For now, it's hard to tell, at the beginning it seems he liked you, but with the whole daring thing, that came out slightly too immature. Good Luck!
PD91hIYWaa	Being in love is when you would do anything for another person. <br>  It is looking into their eyes and knowing that it doesnt get any better, and knowing that this is where you belong. <br>  It is feeling butterflies every time you see or hear them, even years after you first meet. <br>  Love is living to see that person smile everyday, and dedicating you days to making them happy. <br>  Love is really hard to put into words because, its all this stuff and more. You know it when you feel it.|`|733a18bc9b818b5f9d75e4032cd40880aa	At 13 there was Eddie I didn't know what it was but I was so nervous when he was around I couldn't speak while at the same time I wanted to run away from him and get closer to him at the same time. I felt flushed even when he spoke to me.  He asked me to dance once and I felt all hot below, didn't really know why.  He asked me to "go " with him, what we called it then and I thought I would die from happiness.<br>  He gave me a little ring to wear around my neck and kissed me softly.<br>  We were inseparable, we would go skating to dances at the "hop" on picnics and the movies mostly with other couples it was heaven then---<br>  we eventually moved on.  He put too much pressure on me to do it and I wasn't ready to do it so he found some one who would, my best friend of course. (puppy love)<br>  <br>  Then came high school with Prentiss he was a senior and I was a freshie.  Gave me his football sweater and class ring.I was in seventh heaven he was so handsome and so much fun. Knew  everybody went to all the best parties, kissed divine so much so that at 15 I decided we had been together over a year and a half and he had been so sweet to me it was time to do it , so we did it..  Broke up a month later.  Guess I didn't know how to do it and didn't really like it.:<br>  ( Play love)<br>  Then came Joe he was a smooth talker dresser and taught me things I never knew about he was much older took took me to nice resturants<br>  and taught me things about the world. Then "he" moved on<br>  (heartbreak love)<br>  Next came Eugene loved the man to death. small problem he had a wife and daughter tucked away.  A time passed when I just didn't want a relationship anymore, then came Gene. He taught me how to love again we married had 2 kids and lived a wonderful life til his death  10 <br>  years later.(Adult love)<br>  <br>  Finally once again I am with an Ed  for the last 30 years and we're more in love now than I have ever been in my life (smile) and yes we still "do" it !  We finish each other's sentences think about little things to do we know the other likes. We've been soo broke middle class broke again now I guess you'd say we'er hanging in there like most folks these days.  Because he loves me he has rasied my children, because he loves me he has helped raise my oldest grandchildren, because he loves me we are still raising my youngest grandchildren even though the oldest are married and some are in college.  The youngest are 7 year old iwins and a 8 year old girl.  They are really a handfull cause we are now in our 60's.  Because he love me he wakes up early each morning and walks them to school, plays games with them cooks for them cares for them and loves them because he loves me..  Because I love him I care for him scold him tease him play with him adore him because he is and always has been such a sweet loving hardworking man.

It's all the delicate, intricate, beautiful emotions mixed into one perfect guy -- thrilling, exciting, mysterious and exemplar -- passion and lust and true honesty and trust -- dangerously magnificent; the feeling is joyous and brilliant, like you're on top of the world, like your life couldn't get any better. Love is true, sappy, fantastic -- love makes you want to dedicate yourself and never make your true love unhappy.

Yxaht4Cbaa	Wow, that's an interesting situation.  Even if it hurt reallllllly bad, was what he sent via text something that would make you a better person if you improved that area? <br>  <br>   Some people are just blunt.  Some people don't bother saying anything of consequence to people they could care less about, so reasoning backwards, it is possible this guy likes you, but a certain thing you do annoys him and he sees how it would be in your best interest to change it.  Especially if other people say something about that area behind your back and he knows it.  Kind of like Mr. Darcy on Pride and Prejudice.... it was hard for him to ignore the bad behavior of Elizabeth's family even while he was falling in love with her.  <br>  <br>  Love isn't always blind.<br>  <br>  ON the other hand it is possible the paper is connected with some sort of meaness about you.  I really hope not!!!  That would be hard to bare!<br>  <br>  Usually guys would be interested in me without me realizing it until they had decided to be interested in someone else....  The worst cases would talk about what they did for their former girlfriends, or act really weird and almost mean and avoid me so they wouldn't be obvious.  It wasn't just my imagination... people either told me "he used to like you", or the guy would actually start acting nice and tell me himself.  So there you are... I can't say what is in his mind, but I hope this helps.   Guys are funny "critters"... they sometimes start liking a girl before they even know they do.  They also like to "test the water" and see how they get along with a girl, or if she is interested before they actually tell her they like her.   All this can be pretty scary for them, so they often act like being around the girl is like sticking their toe in boiling water....their reactions can be very sharp and sudden or seemingly coldhearted....  <br>  <br>  Your guy sounds like an aloof person.  They don't let others get "inside their heads" easily.<br>  <br>  Hope you figure your mystery man out! <br>  :D

I hate it when guys do that.|`|nFkst9l0aa	funny out going romantic. to treat your gf like she is ur gf and talk to her and make her feel special good personality sensitve but not over the top
eMwZPwRAaa	Sweetie, you have to have confidence in yourself first. Try to find a multicultural church to attend. Ask some of your girlfriends if they know any white men that are interested in black women. It also depends on which state is your home, especially in the south. You could also check out some interracial dating websites. One of the best ways I can think of to find white men is to hang around where they are. I know that can be a problem in a small town; you may even have to go out of your local area or town. I am dating a beautiful black woman right now & I met her in my church! I don't know if any of this helps, but I wish you the best in your search. I know there are plenty of white men that are attracted to black women. There is one source on Yahoo. It is an interracial social site; maybe you could meet someone there.|`|hc89tLJcaa	And, what are you gonna do when a White man treats you like crap? If you think that's something only Black men do, you are very mistaken and need to stay out of the dating game until you mature a bit. Men are men, regardless of race. Some are good. some are dogs. But, their skin color won't give that away! <br>  By the way, I've been treated VERY well by MANY Black men. Maybe it's YOU.|`|Kau2miEwaa	We white men aren't any different from any other men.  We like women, of all shades and colors.  But most white men do think that black women aren't attracted to us (Brad Pitt, George Clooney does not count), or if there's a black woman with a white man, it's only because she can't find a black man that she wants to be with, as though the white man wasn't her first choice, but she settled for white, which pretty much feeds into your question, as you can't seem to find a black man, so you're looking for a white man.<br>  <br>  We white guys are just like everyone else.  We don't want to be the "alternative choice"  No man does.  Which is how a lot of white guys feel if they ask out black women.  Or we may be worried that the girl thinks that we're looking for an "exotic experiment" with the girl being black, when all we want is to take you out for a nice night on the town, and to get to know you better, nothing more than that.<br>  <br>  Black women like yourself are attractive to all men, of all shapes and sizes.  But sometimes we white boys, we get the wrong impression that you won't want us only if there's no black guys around to fit the bill.  Second fiddle.  <br>  <br>  I may sound harsh, but I've never heard of a black woman really wanting a tall, lanky, blond haired white guy when they could easily bag a chocolate skinned, curly browned hair, brown eyed guy.  No decision.  <br>  <br>  You like what you like, and you like what you don't like.  Nothing wrong with that.|`|f77a25d11e0909e57b94a8ea4a8518c5aa	why dont you go about picking a decent black man?<br>  if you want to date white men go ahead but dont because u dated a few bad black guys and you think just because your new boyfriend will be white he will be perfect somehow? to manny people base their race preference on only a few dates.|`|p4u4i1JVaa	ew white men aren't the way to go honey TRUST.
dq7nvrfhaa	I believe that online you can be anybody you want to be..That brings up the the problem that you might be talking to a 80 year old woman/man.<br>  Or a really smart cat.<br>  Not everyone online is ugly however I do think that there is a stigma attached with online dating.<br>  After my sister left he hubby he started dating online and had great luck.<br>  He is attractive.<br>  Thats all i have nothing more good luck.|`|zMDkllJvaa	i agrea to a point about it being kinda pathetic but most young ppl that work and have long term goals doont socialize so dont find bf gf
JO3HiGfHaa	Tall is a matter of opinion. The average person is like 5'9 so being 6'0 in my book isn't tall. I consider myself tall standing at like 6'3 or 6'4.
iocCNTUqaa	Girls that are like that tend to not be super into the 'sensitive' type of guy. But not necessarily the bad guys either. There needs to be some kind of a happy medium. Just find something that you both have in common, get in good with her friends. Make yourself known and remembered by her and her group of friends. Just be yourself, be personable and outgoing. Everyone likes a funny guy. You just have to be bold because bold people are greatly respected more times than not. <br>  Good luck. :)
wqRwSaGSaa	well, if you wanna stay with him you can do it,<br>  my fiances in the military i love him i deal with the 1000 miles away ****.<br>  if you dont think you can put up with the distance, then it would have never worked anyways.
e7KoyoWsaa	I had a wet dream about you last night.  I pissed myself laughing as you fell off of a cliff.<br>  <br>  (sneak up behind him and blow in his hair, he turns to look at you) hey, it's pretty windy in here.   Maybe i should wrap my arms around you to keep you warm.
AA10904025	Darling, that is sooo not true. People are people. Period. I mean don't get me wrong, I know that we all have preferences and it seems like the guys you prefer don't feel the same, but when it's the right guy, none of that will matter. You could be aquamarine and if a guy digs you, he'll be all in your mix. So don't think that they're not into you just because you've got flavor because we all got flavor. Maybe there are some other things going on that you're not aware of. Don't let it get you down that you don't see the Rainbow Coalition outside your window because there are people like you out there.
ezI5HwRWaa	I know you don't want to hear it, but he's using you. Wow, he's a jerk. Don't get attached like that. You've stuck on someone who doesn't like you. Sure he'd use you, but he wouldn't go out with you. Don't say it is your fault, he just isn't the right guy. We all get hurt. Almost everyone has been in a relationship that ended, or liked someone and had it hurt them. Just because you like him so much doesn't mean that there won't be another guy that you will like that much or even more later.<br>  <br>  Fix yourself on moving on. He isn't worth your time. You are 15. You need to focus on yourself right now. When the right guy does come along you will see how much of a jerk this guy really is. It takes awhile to get over someone, and yeah it hurts, but it's best that you start trying. I've learned from experience. I only wish I knew ealier so I wouldn't have wasted so much time and effort.|`|AA10904025	Are you the one with a girlfriend hitting on another girl? Are you the one throwing out mixed signals? Are you the one who is passing up someone who wants you for who you are not how good you look? Well then sweetheart you're not loser. Don't you dare think that. What you are is a girl who is a victim of romance gone awry. Don't fret, it happens to the best of us. ALWAYS. <br>  <br>  There will be other boys. I know hearing that is like an eye roll in waiting, but it need  to be said. For all your angst there is one guy who has seen you and thinks, wow that girl is... <br>  <br>  That boy will be into you if you're dressed pretty or not. That boy won't have a 'plans', you will be his planning partner. That boy is waiting for you to realize he's out there waiting, so you'll dust yourself off and get back out there. Stop making him wait.|`|1GvzuVo1aa	Forget about that loser.

Not sure on this one. I dont think you and this guy can be this close anymore in all respect for your friend. its hard and wierd that your bestfriend is dating your ex in the first place.|`|1ZEYIsPAaa	Simple -- stay away from him for awhile.|`|2JUQYLCGaa	Well first of all this guy sounds like a sleezy pig. Really think about that brief story you wrote and if you have any common sense, you should lose at least a LITTLE respect and attraction for him.<br>  <br>  Also you should tell her what he says and if she has any respect for herself she'll get him to stop or she'll just leave him.<br>  <br>  If it's hurting you that they're together, tell her. I've never known a happy couple to split because of an ex not being okay with it; but she COULD ease the pain by not mentioning him or being around him when you are. Plus, stop hanging out with him. That is just obvious. Absence helps you move on, period. So does filling up your time with anything from sports, to a job, to school work, to projects, etc.<br>  <br>  But the advice I gave you is from me ASSUMING that you hate your best friend dating your ex because you still like him.<br>  <br>  Now here is advice for the second ASSUMPTION that you may hate it because your best friend is with a sleeze:<br>  <br>  Tell her why he's a sleeze but don't call him a sleeze, lol.<br>  If she doesn't leave him, then that's her bad and she'll find out later by being an idiot and staying with him.

Ix4wLPJ5aa	I can tell he really likes you. <br>  <br>  You should start flirting with him and tell his sister that you like him. <br>  <br>  She may slip and tell him. He may like it and ask you out. <br>  <br>  If not just ask him if he wants to go see a movie or something sometime. <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|FSK1v5neaa	ok. Ask the guy out.

My advice would be to put yourself out there more. talk to guys whenever you can. organise for you and you girlfriends to go out, tell them to bring their boyfriends and their guy mates too ;)<br>  good luck!!
n46fsdNZaa	I'd say hey to check up on her the worse that could happen is she doesn't respond at least let her know you were thinking about her may make her feel good.  It might show that you still do care about her.|`|biUmHwmSaa	say hi how are you?<br>  space meaning she doesn't wanna be in that lovey dovey mood with you or anything or she doesn't wanna answer too many questions but if you guys still technically together, then saying hi wouldn't hurt right?<br>  <br>  If she flips out, shes just a big baby.|`|mvSFD8LNaa	Say hi, try to talk it out.<br>  If it goes badly, let her talk to you next time.<br>  If it goes well, then YAY!:)|`|1ZEYIsPAaa	Not tonight. I know it is hard, but just wait awhile -- like a week. With her having cancer, you never know what is really going on with her. It may not even be about you. Just go and have some fun with your guy friends, so you won't spend time over thinking this. By the way, you seem like a good guy : )|`|yTD67IwFaa	If you can't sum up the courage, emailing her would do it. Everything you feel or something short but sweet should definitely make her day and cheer her up.<br>  <br>  Hang in there buddy....
5YEKmHqyaa	Nothing wrong with that.  You don't want him to think your like head over heels for him.  I swear, once guys find out you like them they get a HUGE head and think that you wanna have their babies or something and most of the time it's just a crush.  I think you made the right move.  A lot of times when you tell a guy you no longer like them it makes them think, and they end up flirting with you more because they notice you.  I have NO clue it must just be a guy thing, but i'm sure he will notice you and actually probably start to like you now that you've told him you're over him.  Guys are weird.|`|fI2uesEwaa	I think talking to him was a good move, things probably would have been really awkward if you hadn't. If you two are friends, you should continue to be friends, don't let one weird moment change everything between you two.|`|NzBjnqztaa	It's always best to say it face-to-face, it means that you care enough to not hurt them over text or something.|`|sBNjmsbuaa	At this point don't worry about it..|`|JRJGUTNHaa	guys hate it when girls do this lol|`|039ef10888d2a20e9a827d52f8b78444aa	Guy seems far from interested.

Just act normal and casual when you see him and just talk to him and bee funny and flirtatious but dont look desperate!|`|L4oH4SOCaa	I think it was a great idea to tell him in person!! I hate it when ppl don't tell them  in person. they tell their friends and not the reall person.

CCAw6XLtaa	Cyber and phone sex usually involve sex talk on the phone or over the Internet. Sometimes, one or both people masturbate as they talk about sexually arousing things.<br>  <br>  For some people, cyber and phone sex are ways to have sexual experiences with another person without the risks of pregnancy, disease, or having to work at having a “real life” relationship with someone. Some people like the distance and anonymity of this kind of sex. <br>  <br>  Couples who are separated by distance sometimes use phone or cyber sex to stay close while they’re apart. Other times, people in committed relationships use phone or cyber sex to have outside sexual activity that they don’t see as cheating. But, many people do consider this kind of sex cheating. Others don’t. It’s up to each couple to decide what is OK and what’s not.<br>  <br>  Cyber and phone sex have no risk of pregnancy or disease, since you aren’t in physical contact with the other person. But, if you exchange phone numbers or addresses, then it can be very dangerous since you don’t know who you’re talking to. That’s especially true with cyber sex, where people can lie about their age, sex, and who they are. Sexual predators – rapists, pedophiles -- often disguise themselves and go online to lure young people into sexual encounters, pornography, prostitution and other illegal and dangerous activities.  <br>  <br>  That’s why it’s important to never arrange a personal meeting with someone you only know through the Internet. People have been hurt and even killed by agreeing to meet with people they only know online.|`|bd6b99ad58b64c6d743cd385d230d71caa	That is SO 90s!|`|sXVkRGJIaa	Guys enjoy it more than girls I think.<br>  If you have a good vivid imagination and are horny at the time then you will enjoy it lol..<br>  But in my opinion its just weird and embarrissing. . .|`|OBbuiqZ3aa	Phone sex is talking on the phone with another person while talking about/ describing sex acts, moaning usually talking about things you'd do with each other. Example American Pie 2 has a scene with this in it.<br>  <br>  Cyber Sex i believe is when people instant message or email sex chat back and forth. Just dirty talk, maybe even pictures are used.<br>  <br>  Don't know what the hype is about, because i don't participate in any of that.
84zKeJxnaa	I wouldn't worry too much about it. But when I make out generally it's a series of kisses and the occasional longer smooch.

kGBli717aa	Of course your boyfriend says that; "why buy the cow, if you can get the milk for free?". <br>  Studies show that those couples that live together before marriage are less likely to marry each other. <br>  Would you like to keep the marriage option open with this guy? Then don't move in with him, the odds are against you. And yes, everyone thinks that they are "different" and girls like to think that these studies do not pertain to them. But they do. <br>  See the link and look for other sources.<br>  Only do in your life what you would want your own daughter (when and if you have one) to do. Look to your future, not just pleasing the boyfriend. <br>  If you feel the relationship isn't going anywhere, that should tell you something. And moving in with him will not change things.

EJMwqU3caa	Maybe he won't talk to you because you won't talk to him!!!<br>  Don't scare yourself out of another in-your-face opportunity!!!  Maybe he's too shy to talk to you, too, in which case you're going to get NOWHERE with him!!!   Next time you see him, casually say "hey" with a smile.  If he's not interested he'll probably ignore you, then you know to move on - BUT if he does like you, he will probably stop and talk to you, which is what you want, right?  Take the chance.  Say hi!<br>  (And be sure to smile - it'll help, trust me)<br>  <br>  Good Luck! :)<br>  <br>  Oh, and maybe have something else in the back of your mind to talk to him about also for when he does stop to talk, so that you don't just stare at him like a bumbling fool.  Ask him what he's up to after school or something like that....|`|oPRvq655aa	If you ask me, I say that he likes you<br>  Because the guy I'm dating now, he used to do that too.<br>  <br>  I think they do that because they might be a little too shy to approach you and talk to you. So they wonder around you, probably debating in their minds whether or not to talk to you.<br>  I remember one time I was packing my things at the end of the school day, and the guy was just wandering around where I was, and I swear I saw him watching me from behind. Then when I started to walk, he quickly dashed right in front of me. <br>  So technically it's most probably a way to get your attention ;)<br>  <br>  The next time you see him, you should go up to him and say hi, even though you are scared, there really is nothing wrong with saying hi to someone. Plus it's a great start getting to know him more.<br>  It worked for me, and I'm sure it would work for you :)|`|uvAzxEFUaa	He probably wanted to talk to you but had no idea what to say so he just chickened out. Guys get just as worked up as girls do sometimes. I think the easiest way to start some kind of friendship is to talk to him. I know it's scary and hard but if you want to talk to him that bad, you should do it. It can be a really simple conversation starter too like "oh yeah, hey aren't you ____" or even just a simple 'Hey, what's up?' If he's interested, he'll probably smile and look down a lot if he's shy. If he isn't, he'll probably give you more than one answer replies. If he isn't interested, it'll be pretty easy to tell. You won't know until you try it though!|`|DsNEpN95aa	Based on what you said, it seems like he was about to talk to unless he was walking around you for some weird reason. He didn't talk to because either he was shy or decided he didn't want to or just he simply, he didn't really have the intention to in the first place.<br>  <br>  If I were you, I seriously would make the first move. I mean you guys know each other, so why not? If you guys know each other, talking or striking a short conversation should not be hard. It would be funny if you do the same thing to him next time. He might start thinking about wonder about your actions like the way ur thinking about him!!! <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|27fe1e3ae697035fd2660cec751b7997aa	definitely try talking to him. im guessing you like him?? right? well he probably was going to talk to you, but got really shy. and you are also shy so it makes everything much harder. One of you need to speak up and i know us girls always want the guy to make the 1st move, but thats not always the case... you might need to make the first move on talking to him. just try talking to him tomorrow...  just say hey or something. i know it will be hard, but it will be worth it =)  good luck<br>  <br>  Answer mine???<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Aql6lSFDLfQ3JTZTUckbhojsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090306153258AAJkDuo">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|4kyV3qZNaa	he's probably a little scared, too. but, say a casual "hey" and see what happens<br>  <br>  best of luck! :) <br>  answer mine, plz?|`|2eFIzND0aa	he probably is scared to talk to but try and make your move first if he don't|`|QoVsOK3Daa	Hes just not that in to you..or hes nervous|`|49vO7HWIaa	He's probably just as scared as you. May be shy, I say you make the first move. Just ask him for the time.|`|GCtH2eBUaa	try starting out with a casual "hey" and see where that takes you, have a little more confidence! <br>  <br>  -best of luck :)|`|JjU6IdnDaa	This is normal adolescent behavior.  Girls and guys are discovering that the other sex exists.  This awkward fun.<br>  <br>  He does not know what to say.  Neither do you.  You have to start somewhere.  It is a rite of passage.<br>  <br>  When you have yet to develop the social skills to say anything, you say nothing.  You feel similar in the failure to initiation conversation.  This is only the beginning of learning to evolve personal social skills.  <br>  <br>  Practice talking into the mirror.  Learn to be comfortable with how words look when you speak.  This is a good speaking exercise.  It is a confidence builder.<br>  <br>  Generic friendships will be your first phase of social interaction.  Girls and guys with similar academic, athletic, and extra curricular goals will share activities and interests.|`|ig0miCndaa	I think he wanted to start a conversation but was afraid of your reaction or that you would reject him.  Next time make a point of giving him a BIG smile and saying HI in a friendly way|`|7q5HsXALaa	Crap, I did the same thing. It means he wanted to talk to you but he was nervous (his heart probably went into overdrive and his face must have felt like it was gonna burn off) He probably didn't even know what to say and if he did, again, he was very nervous. I have done this many times. I think u should just smile at him in the hall when u see him, show him u like him so u can encourage him to talk to u, show him u want him to talk to you. Your gonna have to be really patient cause it will take a while for him to make a move and be warned he may never make a move.....|`|xWq93Ckyaa	when he's near you, just make conversation. say hi first, then just bring up anything you can think of. eventually you guys will find that you have things in common and the talking will come naturally, until it moves to a more advanced stage.<br>  <br>  answer mine?<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Ap5WGI7XOuOWY9X8zWYM7GPsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090309193345AAs1nvN">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|KONp01Iraa	I think he might have wanted to talk to you but was nervous because you guys have never talked before.

Smile at him, or just say "hey" and see what he does.
DcrI9zmkaa	There's nothing pathetic about it; however, I don't think it's wise to say that just after a break-up.  The other person needs time to resolve his / her feelings and start moving on.  If the confession is made too early, things don't stand a chance of working out.|`|gYuJUyvvaa	Sweet|`|UplpiqdCaa	that is so sweet<br>  i wish someone would do that for me<br>  i'm not sure how i would react though...|`|AA11275104	Sweet,Not a lot of people can do that these days there to scared and are on here asking if they should say anything or leave it alone. Hey had the guts to say something and he would leave you alone if that would make you happy. That's just plain sweet I don;t know why you would question that.|`|8JU1hxZ1aa	I would think it was sweet but at the same time it would just add to my confusion over the break up... i would start to worry that talking about my feelings and issues with them would hurt them and I'd start to draw back from them. But at the same time if I liked them back it would be a relieft.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|l9bNCR6maa	be freaked out|`|76Tbko40aa	I think it is sweet.<br>  That they would rather you be happy, then them.|`|uSDb8fBpaa	self sacrifice is sweet.<br>  <br>  not having the guts is a lil sad tho|`|C6MOiL1Daa	aww SWEET!
p7oi3P06aa	maybe you can block his number. also contact your principle or an adult. yeah its not the coolest thing to do, but it is harassment. if you don't feel comfortable talking to him/her contact someone you know and trust (that has the power to stop him)|`|vR4k5iVCaa	let someone else know about your situation and if you feel threatened than you need to go to the police. keep a record of when he calls. when he calls do you engage in conversation w/ him? if so than maybe he feels like your leading him on. tell him upfront that your not interseted in him record the day that you told him and like i said b4 if it keeps happening than reprt him to somebody|`|0yh3bcjpaa	completely ignore him, ive had the same exact problem he finally got the hint but still to this day he will send me a random email, its been goin on for a couple of years, havent ever talked to him since, but he still sends me stuff, again ignore him, and he will lighten up!|`|uYVyEZ7Aaa	how about a good ol' fashioned 'f*ck off*|`|6f8eb1df236b453d41b94b11467cd780aa	Tell him to leave you alone.

Tell him your taken. My sure your guy friend is hot and built and make it look like you guys are dating. Make your friend tell him to leave you alone or you'll make him beat the sh-it out of him. or move. OR JUST CALL THE DAMN POLICE IF IT GETS  OUT OF HAND.|`|9qndirR3aa	i recommend that you report him to the police.

It's not even a close second.<br>  <br>  I spend time in the evenings on the internet, mainly because i'm single and i have no one to spend time with right now.  If i would happen to meet someone and get into a relationship, i wouldn't be online much at all.<br>  <br>  take care of YOU.|`|nxMi4adjaa	leave him, don't settle<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090309194014AAm0bM2">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|jGCkjJjdaa	He should have enough respect for you to not do these things when he is with you. That is your time together. You should talk to him about refraining from these activities when you are together. If he doesn't, maybe you should go out with your friends and family and enjoy time with people that will be there for you. It will wear on your emotions. I have been there.|`|veZLfnGFaa	No - you aren't just being jealous.  You are human.  Why do you let him sit there and do this?  Sorry, but this isn't a serious relationship.  If it were, he would be with you instead of them.  Open your eyes before it's too late.|`|AA11106650	What the fu*k?

onQgOw8naa	I know its hard. actually its really hard on both ends because i have experienced them both. Really all that will make it better is time and not getting to down on yourself, saying your not good enough and things like that. honestly he owes you an explanation next time you get a chance get one.|`|4vhTUtVfaa	im sorry. that's gotta suck. i'm sure he'll come to his senses.|`|4wQffufZaa	keep yourself busy<br>  like cleaning studying reading or something<br>  it helps me with anything that bothers me<br>  one time i cleaned my room for 6 hours straight<br>  because something happend <br>  and i felt better cuz i was exausted and fell asleep<br>  :]|`|GXGh37YSaa	Maybe he's goin through somethin right now and he's very confused...give it time and ask again in a week or so...maybe you guys will become friends. <br>  but for now, eat lots of ice cream and chocolate!!! and if you have a dog, or cat, pet him/her it helps!<br>  feel better|`|mTgPwGuhaa	males are always male ,we tend to play anything known as female...try to do away with him....following him make you look cheap|`|lg2WgrW6aa	yo this 1st week try to relax idk take hot baths eat sweets or wateva makes u relax like for example smokin bud and cigarettes calms me down. okay this weekend go to like sleepovers and go out wit ur friends just get out and chill try to meet new ppl make new friends meet new guys go clubbing or anything to keep yourself busy because if you are busy having fun with your friends you not going to think bout the guy as much so then later on you gonna meet someone 1000 times better then him and dont pay attention to your ex if he tries talking to you act ****** up if he asks you why r u actin like that tell him i dont need a reason to act ****** up and i dont wanna talk bout it. then if you just do what i said you goin to forget about him in 2-3 weeks because you are going to realize how many more nicer and more better guys there are out there|`|N9GRt5QPaa	Don't do anything until you've thought it over long and hard. Don't email, text , or call him. Be cordial and say hello when spoken to, but give yourself time as well as him. You're only 15, you have many years of learning how this works. Clear your mind before you say or do anything irrational, until then enjoy the single life! Spend time with your friends and you'll start to learn more and more about yourself!|`|QVWcnIIqaa	What a jerk! If he does that to you, he doesn't deserve your love. <br>  <br>  Yes, it's going to be hard to get over him. But if he does that to you, you shouldn't easily forgive him. Don't nag, don't beg, and don't plead. Let him be, and he'll come crawling back if he loves you, and if he doesn't he won't. <br>  <br>  If he doesn't, who cares? You've got a life ahead of you (and I'm not even an adult and I'm saying that) and you can't let him ruin it. Move on, and remember how you are FREE now, and that you can flirt all you want. Check out guys, or go out with friends for a girl's night out. don't let him drag you down!|`|2eFIzND0aa	well let me tell you, he don't know what he is missing out. the best way to get over him is to cry it out and you would feel better. but don't stress to much about this guy, because he is probably not thinking why he broke up with you. when you see him just pass him like you don't even know he existed .ok.|`|DwiQ66qyaa	hey there<br>  <br>  I'm sorry he broke up with you.<br>  <br>  I know it's really hard to let go of someone you love.

SXQ3K6z6aa	ok im a guy but so what im in touch with my feminine side sooo.... yah anyways he probably still has feelings about you... dont just straight up ask him... but what you should do is slowly converse into it best approach is via IM or texting so that you dont blush all over the place... thats embarrassing... but some guys (me) find blushing very cute and somewhat of a turn on|`|LrVzkhl4aa	Does he have a girlfriend currently? If not, go out with him again maybe? If so, try to get over him. =/|`|fQSEzuoEaa	OH GOD THAT JUST HAPPENED TO ME!<br>  Althought mines a rather sad story. He told me he liked me, then told my best friend he dint and never bothered to tell me. Then I found out, and then he got another girlfriend.  BUt he was a jerk so it really didn't bother me. Not all guys are like him, he's one of a kind in a bad way. I hope yours is 10000000000000000000000000000X better. Just ask him how he feels about you.|`|UGSlEhnbaa	Ohhhhhh... That always happens when I break up with a guy I really like. I move a lot so I can't really keep a stable relationship and I always think about the guys I've dated and get those same emotions.

lNlL0Ag2aa	If you're questioning about whether or not you like him, then he isn't the one for you. Love should spark immediately and if it doesn't, then there is no affection at all.<br>  <br>  ADDED:<br>  <br>  If you're positive that Jacob was not interested in you, then he will NEVER get jealous if you date Travis, and also you should date Travis if you actually have feelings for him which you do not. So dating him will actually hurt him more in the end then not dating him at all.|`|10ynxgdmaa	u n me r a lot alike i m in the same sitation date travis it seems to me that u like him be ghonest  tell travis how u feel n that will make jacob jealous n he mightfind out he likes u n then u can to decide if u want jacob just remeber never limit yourself to guys bella lovs jacob n edward so make it work best u can hope this helps!!|`|8l9KFl2raa	Seems like you should give yourself a little time to clear your head. If you decide you want to go after travis...casually ask him if he could ever see you as more than friends. Guys like Jacob are a dime a dozen and sounds like you can afford to pursue other things|`|j4P72PsBaa	kendra. if you dont think u like him u do.<br>  we all know its true thats how it works.<br>  If jacob doesnt like u then his loss.<br>  your a great writer. and I bet you have a great personallity.<br>  give travis a chance and mabe you'll see that u do actually like him.<br>  It never hurts to try.<br>  forget jacob, hes the past travis is the present.<br>  <br>  hope this helps.
ajzdsUldaa	Your fiance sounds like a good guy, but some people are naturally more insecure than others regardless of how faithful their partner appears to be, and you're one of them.<br>  <br>  This isn't a big problem or a serious issue unless of course you start to become obssessive. But let's face it, everyone always goes on about trust and love, blah blah blah, but lots of women/men chasing after their partner can make anyone feel insecure.<br>  <br>  For example, my boyfriend used to be a semi-professional football (soccer) player, and is returning to play. I have no trust issues or security issues with him now, but I often wonder how I will feel when he has hoardes of women running after him!<br>  <br>  Tell him how you feel, and being as he sounds like a good guy, he will most likely offer you some reassurance. However, if this becomes a prolonged problem and you find yourself needing more assurance, than perhaps it's time to assess what is truly causing your insecurity. More often than not, it's low self-esteem, whether or not you recognise it.<br>  <br>  Work on your confidence girl! From your picture, you're an attractive young lady and the fact that he's been with you for two years says a lot about you - you must have some wonderful qualities that other women have not been able to offer him, and that's why he's with you.<br>  <br>  Sorry for the essay, but good luck!|`|l9bNCR6maa	girl if your going to marry him some day trust in him must come to you naturally . girls will be girls and theres no getting away from that live with it half the population is female <br>  My fiance is a history teacher everyday he goes into a all girls school and gets chatted up by these beautiful much younger women but you know what i have trust in him|`|44ZMz0jfaa	I think it's a good idea to bring it up.... some reassurance always helps!<br>  <br>  And remember-- there is a reason he chose YOU! there is a reason he has been YOUR boyfriend and chose to propose to YOU...clearly you are special to him!|`|jqsu76T5aa	deff talk to him about it!<br>  =]<br>  good luck hunnn<3|`|Rq8YGaHAaa	I totally know how that feels... you should definitely talk to him about it. I'm pretty jealous and I felt embarrassed bringing it up with my boyfriend at first but it's good to level about that stuff.<br>  <br>  Maybe he'll stop talking to those girls if he knows it bothers you.|`|MMx7TeEBaa	Whats love without trust, ya's have been together 2years and are engaged and you don't trust him?  <br>  <br>  If he wanted someone else he would not still be with you. Why would he have proposed if he wanted to go around with other lasses.<br>   Ask him about it and if he tells you he only wants you and is not interested in anyone else then accept that and stop having doubts otherwise that will end up being the reason for you both to split. It will put tension on you both.<br>  <br>  Lasses and lads always flirt when there out but its mostly harmless banta and if he is telling them he is taken then you really don't have anything to worry about.<br>  <br>  My partner and I are engaged and have been together over 3yrs now and we have really strong trust for each other, he tells me if he is texting a lass(as a friend) and always lets me read the texts so i know who she is and what they are talking about and i tell him if i am going out with lad m8ts which he is fine with, but we live together and always know were each other is.<br>  <br>  Honesty is the best way to be and you really need to tell him how your feeling. I hope you can learn to trust him, i think you just care for him so much your terrified he will leave you but relax and enjoy your relationship, your engaged you should be happy and looking forwards to your future not stressing yourself out :).<br>  Good luck babes hope you sort it out|`|CtUVT49Gaa	if you have nothing to be suspicious of then I wouldn't worry if I were you...<br>  <br>  He's with you for a reason...and engaged too...so try and forget about it...to be honest though Im 20 and can't even imagine being engaged so u 2 must have something special...<br>  <br>  You gotta trust him if your that commited to him...a relationship without trust is like an ice cream cone without the ice cream...lol<br>  <br>  I don't usually do serious answers...in a weird mood...:)|`|O5KOwhovaa	Don't worry about it.<br>  <br>  <br>  Some girls just like talking to guys who they find it easy to talk to.<br>  <br>  It's harmless.
RnQFwIuUaa	One way is to let her know that she can't have you as a boyfriend/friend. If you tell someone they can't have something, they will want it. Tell her the rules of being exes. She can't expect you to call her as her boyfriend or be mad because you are not her boyfriend. It called boundaries.|`|qkYCOh6uaa	one way is to stop talking to her constantly<br>  if she calls too much, then tell her you're busy half the time<br>  act towards her like any other way youd act towards your friends<br>  not especially caring for her or anything<br>  that would make her want you now that it seems like she's lost you<br>  <br>  another way, <br>  from what it seems like, she still likes you<br>  express your feelings and bring up things that you both shared from the past<br>  memories and trigger a whole bunch of things<br>  but if you dont want to, then dont make it too direct<br>  <br>  goodluck!
jpGNV4Qhaa	ignore them...play the silent treatment and avoid eye contact most of the time..if you wanan make them annoyed also, you should smile at them once in a while then completely ignore them..it makes their mind boggle :) hehee have funn|`|779f397084aa4666983d22c2e4d1a290aa	that's quite immature, but whatever. to ignore someone you simply don't talk to them, don't look at them, or acknowledge their presence. that would make anyone upset.|`|AA12095402	~So, what happens if you ignore the person and they don't get mad because they really don't care about what you do or think.<br>  <br>  Aren't you going to feel crappy?:<br>  <br>  Don't waste your time (and youth) on such trivial musings.|`|Cwmb0tJJaa	Be super nice and calm.

t24aL6qVaa	Tease her a little (not meanly)- try to make her laugh<br>  Smile at her<br>  Tell her she's beautiful <br>  Tell her you like hanging out with her<br>  Compliment her in other ways too, but don't seem too clingy<br>  did i help at all> ;)|`|xV672tJcaa	Look her in the eyes like you're telling her she's beautiful without actually saying anything...

O_o OH yea ! im sure guy 1 and 2 like you.|`|flMOEeNnaa	...it means he likes you.|`|AA11263103	1. Examine his body language. If he likes you, you may see that he rarely turns his back to you, often leans towards you, and also looks at you a lot. Both his feet will point towards you if he's comfortable with you, but if he's uncomfortable with you, one foot will be pointing at you and the other will be pointing at another girl.<br>  2. Notice his eye contact. If he likes you, he may either look away quickly if he is shy, or he'll try to catch your eye and hold it or make faces. This can be uncomfortable if you don't like him. If you feel like you have held eye contact just a fraction of a second longer than you would with anyone else, or if he looks away quickly, then there is something there. When he's around you and he says/does something funny and everyone around laughs, his eyes will flicker towards you for a second to see if you laughed, too.<br>  * His pupils may dilate if he likes you, but this is quite hard to pick up on, and you might come across as acting strangely by looking that closely into his eyes. If you're around him for a long time, it could be easier to pick up on gradually.<br>  * Hint: If you like him, your pupils may be dilated. Check a mirror, then see if his eyes are similar.<br>  3. When a guy likes you he will try and make himself seem impressive to you.<br>  * Listen to what he's saying. If he likes you, and he's nervous, he'll probably start talking about himself. Many times, guys feel the need to prove themselves- especially if you talk about another guy in his company.<br>  4. Be aware of touching. He might put his hand on your arm when he laughs, and won't move his leg if it happens to touch yours, or he may hug you for small things - all are good signs of a guy liking you. But be careful because this may be a result of him just being nice to you and not fancying you.<br>  5. Watch for him showing interest in things you like and do. For example, if you like a certain genre of music that he likes as well, he may suggest bands or artists for you to listen to. Another example, if you play sports he may ask to play against you just to show off that he's good at something you both like and then also have a reason to give you compliments as well.<br>  6. Notice the way he treats you - does he playfully tease you, or call you names, just to try and get your attention? It's natural for a guy to tease when he likes a girl, but remember, someone can still tease someone, even if they aren't attracted to them. Also, keep in mind that some guys simply will not tease you.<br>  7. Check for signs of nervousness Nervous laughter, sweaty palms, deep breaths, fidgeting, looking away quickly when you notice if he is watching you are all good signs of an attraction towards you and that he is nervous about making an impression on someone he fancies. Also notice if you call his name, does his head snap around right away or does it turn gradually?<br>  8. Smile at him- a big smile in return is a good sign. Also, see if he always ends up in the same part of the room as you; perhaps he keeps going out of his way to bump into you and to flash his smile in your direction. If so, then smile back!<br>  9. Pay attention to his friends. If they know he's interested in you, they might tease him subtly when you're around, hint to you that he likes you, or even try to find out if you like him. Study their reactions to your presence - do they smile? Do they turn to him? Do they smirk in a way that suggests they know something that you don't? Maybe when they dare him in games of truth and dare, they always dare him to do something to you. If so, then there's a good chance that they know that he really does like you.<br>  10. Be open! Give him room to approach you and talk to you - it can ruin the situation if he hasn't got any opportunity to do so, for example if your friends are giggling in the background, or you are never on your own.<br>  11. Pay attention to how many times he uses your name. If you talk to him often, watch how many times he uses your first name. People tend to use your name to get your attention, and it shows that they think about you! For example, if you say something, and he replies with "ha ha, nice, [ name here ]" it means he thinks about what he is saying more than if he replies with "ha ha, nice." The second doesn't mean he doesn't like you, but using your name is usually a tell-tale sign.<br>  12. Notice his behavior in conversation. Sometimes when guys ask you questions and other people distract the conversation or cut him off, he'll just forget about it. If you notice that he keeps asking or changing the subject back to the question until you answer, then he may like you - but if the topic is something serious, he may just want to know out of curiosity.<br>  13. He'll flirt with other girls to get your attention- If a guy is really into you he will want to make you jealous. So, he will most likely flirt with other girls in front of you. It gives them a chance to see your real self.|`|RnQFwIuUaa	It means that he was showing his friend that he likes you and to back off because he hopes to pursue you.

HOERKWvhaa	Well first of all I would say take a pain reliever or two so you can feel a little better and think more clearly. Be sure you are getting plenty of sleep at night and be sure you give yourself time to rest at home if you can. I think you probably have a cold or something of the sort and you need to get more rest. Don't be afraid to ask your parents, friends, or a nurse at your school for help. Maybe take things a bit easier for a while until you are better. <br>  Make sure you get plenty of fluids, especially water. Even though you don't feel very hungry you still need to eat. A good thing to eat would be something like peanuts or toast with peanut butter on it. It's important to eat enough and stay well hydrated. <br>   As for swim practice, all I can say is to not compare yourself to others, but rather to yourself. Get better at swimming but don't stress over it. Just give your best and be satisfied with how you do. I know how you feel, but just don't be overwhelmed, remain calm, and try to stay happy! Try listening to some music and unwinding with some friends if you can. Good luck! :)

This can lead to grudges ect. Some men are defensive about this. If you are fighting a male is more 'honorable' to fight with respect, but if you do beat him his pride will he hurt one way or another. (I'm speaking from a typical point of view mind you)<br>  If a man is forcing you to fight (IE self defense) You need to contact the police immediately. It can be used as a method to protect yourself but fending someone off will only work for so long. Again, contact the authority's as soon as possible if this is going on.|`|PukfhDWnaa	This is what is called, fulfilling the desires of the flesh.

hvCMLMJFaa	Since you are always listening to music try to talk to her about music. This way, it will seem you aren`t trying to hard, and you might get a good conversation out of it. Start by saying "hey, what type of music are you into?" If it happens she is like your music soulmate then offer to listen to the music with you. If not, ask her whar artists she is into and if she would recommend it. And just to let you know, the people who are great at convos do less of the talking. And thats because they take more time interested in someone elses life. and its human nature to like it when people take interests in you life. by the way i am about three years younger than you.|`|W6pT1Wp3aa	Just be casual, next time say "hey, what's up" and see what she says. Keep the music off and it will make you more approachable for her
0BdTKNZzaa	C'mon, he's a moron. What's worse is you had a second date with him.
N4X8VSUvaa	I think so maybe a different kind of  ring would be good what about her birthstone. Single diamond is too much like an engagement. Even a birthstone earrings and necklace would be nice.|`|O1lm79EFaa	not at all<br>  <br>  If the box isn't blue aka isn't Tiffanys don't give it|`|0ky4TktEaa	I think you've already spent WAY too much money trying to impress her with expensive gifts. Chill out on the spending and lets see if she sticks around. Hate to bring you down, but gold diggers don't exactly present themselves as such. If she's in it for the expensive goodies, she'll split after you cut them off. If she's not, she'll still be around and things will be the same. <br>  <br>  You've done more than is necessary and probably more than most couples do in years as far as buying gifts go. I think a ring, at this point, should only be to symbolize an engagement (excluding say a cute silver ring she mentioned she liked at the mall).|`|37M3dkkRaa	who told you that you have to buy this woman's love? love is something that comes from the heart, not something that you have to earn by buying things. why can't you show her you love her in a different way? like a romantic date where you guys can be alone and enjoy each other and your surroundings? i'm not saying the ring is too much for one year of being together, but i am saying that she may think you're trying to buy her, she may be using you to get things also.|`|z4c7zGKmaa	If I got a ring for our anniversary, I would assume it was an engagement ring.  If you really want to buy her jewelry, I would buy her anything but a ring.
zoURc4vOaa	say Do you wanna go out with me?<br>  <br>  dont jump in with the whole gf/bf thing yet... you have to go out a couple times before thats official|`|2wZhVA8faa	Aww... haha don't be stressing about it! :) Just relax... that's always the first step! <br>  <br>     1. Get alone with him/her or call him/her on the phone.<br>     2. Talk about stuff.<br>     3. Relax. Take a deep breath.<br>     4. Smile (even if you're on the phone). Remember that s/he will be flattered by your question.<br>     5. Pop the question: '[name], will you go out with me?'<br>     6. Relax, pay attention.<br>     7. Listen to his/her reply.<br>     8. Don't interrupt!<br>     9. If the answer was 'Yes,' congratulations! Within the next 24 hours, let him/her know how much you appreciate him/her.<br>    10. If the answer was 'No,' that stinks, I know. Respect his/her decision and talk with him/her about where to go from here, especially if you're friends.<br>  <br>  Tips:<br>  <br>     1. Do something to make him/her feel special (send a card, give a flower, compliment him/her, write a letter).<br>     2. Be confident. Believe in yourself!<br>     3. Do not put your value as a person in their answer. If s/he says no, you're OK with yourself.<br>     4. Know that there is somebody out there for you, even if the person you want right now isn't interested.

This is what people think of in modern times as being a "soul mate."<br>  <br>  I think that's absolute BS, however. It sure sounds nice, though.<br>  <br>  In reality, I think that each person has numerous matches. If any two people want to be in a relationship together and want to put in the effort, then it can be a success.
naequcqlaa	In ALL fairness to you, I'm going to be truthful.  I do NOT feel things are starting off on the rite foot.  There is just way too much baggage to begin with.  When a relationship starts from breaking up & hurting one person, it's all going to come rite back to you & in the end you're going to end up being hurt too.  I know, I did just that.  You just cannot expect good to come from something that started out bad in the first place.  I got involved w/a married man, we broke up my marriage & his too.  Ours also ended up in a divorce.  Another thing as you stated, of all months, why did she pick the very month of her ex's B.D. IF she's still communicating w/her ex, she has to have a reason for also doing this.  I personally feel there are just far too many red flags waving in front of your face on this one & I feel YOU are going to be the ONE who ends up being hurt on this one.  IF you KNOW she still has feelings for him, why are you even putting yourself in the position of the line of fire so to speak?  Don't you truly get the feelings she's just going to end up cheating on YOU w/him?!  There are just far too many "free" girls out there, why would you even want to get involved w/all this tons of baggage on your shoulders.  NO, you are NOT being paranoid whatsoever, something is trying it's best to get thru to you & warn you of "troubles ahead" & to beware of them ALL.  You're too trying to justify her reasons for still being friends w/him.  NO, there is more to it than just "gratitude", please trust me on that one.  But, do trust me on that you just cannot build a happy relationship based on hurting someone else to try to have happiness.  It's just not going to work, & ritefully so.  You're just going to drive yourself crazy in the long run wondering where she is at times, who is she with, what is she doing & who is she doing it with.  OH those red flags are just waving so fast & furiously at you.  They are doing this for a reason, & I'm a firm believer that things DO happen for reasons.  So, IF you want to take it from someone who walked in your shoes, PLEASE head my warnings for your own sake.  I had to answer this post because I actually lived it & only lost in the end.  Do as you wish, but also do some serious soul searching & don't try to justify things, look at them in the face of reality.  I have a strong feeling that if you were NOT in the picture, she'd be back w/him in a flash. I DO wish you all the best, & trust you make all the rite choices for YOU...:)|`|AA10064730	I was going to say the same thing as luvtocha, "If she'll do it with you, she'll do it to you"|`|253749a8c740b2b9ceb438a7f88d0d44aa	Rule to remember: If she'll do it with you, she'll do it to you. Just get ready.|`|ma36UfpBaa	Eeek! <br>  <br>  First, about the month of the wedding... I don't think it has anything to do with it being her ex birthday month. People usually set a date around things like weather, finances, etc. Now if it was on his actual birthday then I would question it. <br>  <br>  You got together as a result of having an affiar with her? Of course everyone is going to tell you... "if they do it with you, they will do it to you"... Personally, I think that is a bunch of crap. I will say that 95% of the time it is true, but everyone's case is different and there are so many variables to consider. I don't think it is a great way to start off a relationship considering a good foundation requires trust, but only you know the relationship you have with this woman. <br>  <br>  As far as what you tell me about her, I would say there are some red flags. Why is she still communicating with her ex? Do they have children together? If they do then I can understand communicating, but you say they still have feelings for each other? She only talks to him out of gratitude? If they don't have any reason (kids) to be communicating then why are they? RED FLAG! I am sorry but the girl is with you now and he is her ex... if you think they still having feelings for each other then why are you about to marry this woman??? She sounds like she might fall into the 95% catergory - if they do it with you they will do it to you... I hate saying it but again, only u know your relationship with her. <br>  <br>  Well, I can tell you this much... you have doubt. I ALWAYS say that no one should ever get married if they have even an ounce of doubt. ABORT MISSION and get to the bottom of these things before you say "I do" <br>  <br>  Good luck|`|7HNnAejLaa	People can change. I was like that with my ex but I would never dream of it now. If your the one for her you will be fine. If you don't trust her you will be the one who won't make it work. If she cheats on you, then deal with it.|`|4POGapREaa	You're already questioning it due to trust issues & that's exactly why they usually fail.  Think of the type of character a person has to have in order to look someone in the eye & bold face lie while screwing someone else.  Actually screwing both at the same time I betcha.  Do you realize how twisted that is?  You'll probably always see red flags coming up & eventually it wears a person down, accusations start, snooping, etc. then both people get sick of it, you know?<br>  <br>  And why do you have to marry her anyway?  She's already proven how she treats men in relationships so . . .|`|AA11967247	"I know they both still have feelings for each other (words came out of their mouths to each other via IM)"<br>  <br>  ..if your ok with that, then i guess its alright

ktEfBhszaa	I think sometimes guys ignore girls they like to sort of overcompensate. For example: if I like "Girl A" and I'm not sure how they feel about me or not I might tend to ignore them more. This is because I'm over thinking the entire situation and don't want to give them the idea that I like them if there's no chance of anything happening. So I might try hiding my feelings but could overshoot and turn into ignore mode.|`|Gs2VCx6daa	I ignore them if I don't like them but they like me.

O4hq5McPaa	first of all i just want to say sistas before mistas<br>  <br>  but if u really don't think he's right for her u should tell her<br>  <br>  i would just tell the truth if i were u, it feels alot better to let things of your mind rather than keeping them all bottled up.<br>  <br>  hope this helps:)
8Zy7SOlkaa	speak to him about it, tell him that he is not giving you the time you deserve, tell him that even you have your expectations, see running away from a relation is not always the solution, speaking and sorting things is much better, it clears things and even lets your partner know what you got in your mind.|`|Oj1ac4Kuaa	IF you like to much that girl ask him to mary you|`|ng3bSBiaaa	you could just confront him about it.. tell him you miss it. don't nag him-because guys hate that, i know from experience. but just tell him you want to go out still and be more of a couple. you miss how it used to be. thats what'd i'd do. and if it doesnt help-break up.. if your not happy-you're not meant to be with him anyways! hope i helped at least a little. :)|`|FgU9yNhCaa	Leave him, people like them are the burdens on this society. Wasting 5 hours a day on game is just not right. Even if you give him warning, he will return to his old ways. These guys are losers and they will never do anything in their life other than may be working 9-6 if lucky.

It does kind of sound like he was looking for re-assurance. He was obviously drunk and that always gets the emotions flowing. You are lucky to have a guy who loves you so much. Enjoy your relationship and cherish every moment.|`|Wc96SRkpaa	normally when people are drunk.. they dont put muich effort into texting, and if they do.. it usually doesnt turn out to awesome.<br>  <br>  example: 'What's up?' ends up being 'wgav up''|`|nHy79GgLaa	I think you should ask him yourself. We don't know how your fella is feeling :)<br>  having said that, people apparently become more "honest" when they've been drinking.|`|gX3MeosXaa	He probably means it but when he said it it's obvious he was drunk because he kept asking if "are you my baby" which meant the alcohol made him feel insecure.
a5565417605b533189dbbb903dc7526faa	Okay, first of all.. tell your friend.  She's the one that will always be by your side and helping you with your drama.  Second of all, talk your friend into giving him a chance.  He did what he did to get to you, so obviously he is/was interested in you.  People change, you said it's been years~ so maaaaybe he isn't a player anymore.  (Some say once a playa, always a playa.. but who knows really? haha).  Anyways, hope this helped and good luck! :]|`|FrB3sGnwaa	i think your friend is just jeolous.... tell her that you REALLY like this guy and that she shouldnt be able to stop u from dating him. tell her that u would support her if this ever happened to her|`|kgz3hUGtaa	Im just gonna say a couple words:Honesty is the best policy. or something like that.in resume (Tell your friend cause if she finds out by herself she'll hate you for not telling her)|`|NkFxlEPqaa	Hmmmm...sounds like your best friend is still resenting this guy using her to get to you. Let's add bitter jealousy while we're at it. Jealous because she wasn't 'good enough' but you ' were.' Considering what he did in the past, that certainly makes him a player - you sure you want to test this theory and risk not only losing a best friend but also the heartbreak from him dumping you for someone else supposedly ' better?' I wouldn't. What's to risk? ALOT What's to gain? Only the thrill of someone you know is totally forbidden right? After that,...then what? There's alot of other hot guys around that are at least worth your time. I also felt that your friend was looking out after your best interests..being protective...even if she is still ticked at what he did to her. Leave the boy waaaay out in an orbit somewhere close to the end of life as we know it and keep a loyal best friend!

kGBli717aa	You only talk to him (about) once every two weeks? Who is this, Obama? Who in the hell is that busy? Gee, what will it be like if he starts taking you for granted? Forget about the rest the story; if that's the only time he can make for you, you are better off without him. Think about it. Don't be a doormat.
AA11263103	1. Examine his body language. If he likes you, you may see that he rarely turns his back to you, often leans towards you, and also looks at you a lot. Both his feet will point towards you if he's comfortable with you, but if he's uncomfortable with you, one foot will be pointing at you and the other will be pointing at another girl.<br>  2. Notice his eye contact. If he likes you, he may either look away quickly if he is shy, or he'll try to catch your eye and hold it or make faces. This can be uncomfortable if you don't like him. If you feel like you have held eye contact just a fraction of a second longer than you would with anyone else, or if he looks away quickly, then there is something there. When he's around you and he says/does something funny and everyone around laughs, his eyes will flicker towards you for a second to see if you laughed, too.<br>  * His pupils may dilate if he likes you, but this is quite hard to pick up on, and you might come across as acting strangely by looking that closely into his eyes. If you're around him for a long time, it could be easier to pick up on gradually.<br>  * Hint: If you like him, your pupils may be dilated. Check a mirror, then see if his eyes are similar.<br>  3. When a guy likes you he will try and make himself seem impressive to you.<br>  * Listen to what he's saying. If he likes you, and he's nervous, he'll probably start talking about himself. Many times, guys feel the need to prove themselves- especially if you talk about another guy in his company.<br>  4. Be aware of touching. He might put his hand on your arm when he laughs, and won't move his leg if it happens to touch yours, or he may hug you for small things - all are good signs of a guy liking you. But be careful because this may be a result of him just being nice to you and not fancying you.<br>  5. Watch for him showing interest in things you like and do. For example, if you like a certain genre of music that he likes as well, he may suggest bands or artists for you to listen to. Another example, if you play sports he may ask to play against you just to show off that he's good at something you both like and then also have a reason to give you compliments as well.<br>  6. Notice the way he treats you - does he playfully tease you, or call you names, just to try and get your attention? It's natural for a guy to tease when he likes a girl, but remember, someone can still tease someone, even if they aren't attracted to them. Also, keep in mind that some guys simply will not tease you.<br>  7. Check for signs of nervousness Nervous laughter, sweaty palms, deep breaths, fidgeting, looking away quickly when you notice if he is watching you are all good signs of an attraction towards you and that he is nervous about making an impression on someone he fancies. Also notice if you call his name, does his head snap around right away or does it turn gradually?<br>  8. Smile at him- a big smile in return is a good sign. Also, see if he always ends up in the same part of the room as you; perhaps he keeps going out of his way to bump into you and to flash his smile in your direction. If so, then smile back!<br>  9. Pay attention to his friends. If they know he's interested in you, they might tease him subtly when you're around, hint to you that he likes you, or even try to find out if you like him. Study their reactions to your presence - do they smile? Do they turn to him? Do they smirk in a way that suggests they know something that you don't? Maybe when they dare him in games of truth and dare, they always dare him to do something to you. If so, then there's a good chance that they know that he really does like you.<br>  10. Be open! Give him room to approach you and talk to you - it can ruin the situation if he hasn't got any opportunity to do so, for example if your friends are giggling in the background, or you are never on your own.<br>  11. Pay attention to how many times he uses your name. If you talk to him often, watch how many times he uses your first name. People tend to use your name to get your attention, and it shows that they think about you! For example, if you say something, and he replies with "ha ha, nice, [ name here ]" it means he thinks about what he is saying more than if he replies with "ha ha, nice." The second doesn't mean he doesn't like you, but using your name is usually a tell-tale sign.<br>  12. Notice his behavior in conversation. Sometimes when guys ask you questions and other people distract the conversation or cut him off, he'll just forget about it. If you notice that he keeps asking or changing the subject back to the question until you answer, then he may like you - but if the topic is something serious, he may just want to know out of curiosity.<br>  13. He'll flirt with other girls to get your attention- If a guy is really into you he will want to make you jealous. So, he will most likely flirt with other girls in front of you. It gives them a chance to see your real self.|`|bQTFX54waa	haha well it sounds like he does<br>  but then time we don't need names LOL<br>  good luck though=)
4YPseFSIaa	yeah its up to you, if you want him in there.|`|ZUELM4Nnaa	I'm fairly sure that if he has your permission to come into the room it shouldn't be a problem, especially if it'll help calm you or for moral support. <br>  <br>  As long as it's just a check up and there's no surgery involved, it shouldn't be a problem. Better call the hospital/doctors to check just in case, they will be able to tell you for sure.|`|pvZZ9Jzmaa	I think he can|`|y3lBLqIOaa	I'm not sure but..<br>  <br>  they might make him sign a privacy paper for security or they might ask him to wait in the waiting room.|`|KjF0p72naa	gross you are really weird. HE shouldnt want to come-no way.|`|y46FXf62aa	You can. You are an adult according to the law. It is your choice. However, as a guy, I do not particularly consider the gyno disney world or something so ask him if he want to do it(b do it  mean go to the gyno with you)|`|xoXkHOVsaa	Probably, but why would you want to?  It's super personal and will probably gross him out.  Your doctor will also probably give you a huge sex talk.|`|zprAkP3eaa	What is a gyno app?|`|aiRn2lQGaa	yes you should be able to have him come in with you
uxCk69hPaa	sigh it sucks doesnt it? i dont like being single but im dealing with it. its hard for me as well cuz i work mon-fri then i stay home n relax on my days off.... i'm 20 and should go out,,,,<br>  <br>  anyways back 2 u LOL as a girl i say just ask a girl out and see what happens ask the cutie in the coffee shop if you can sit down or for her number.... even just start with baby steps make eye contact.... and go from there...|`|ff27c578abd6f97b50c76f87e94ae774aa	Just talk to the girls that sit around you in your lectures. Be friendly and see if they want to meet up to study or for lunch after class one day or something. Don't be shy. If they say no or that they have a boyfriend, don't dwell on it. Just talk to people. Make new friends and see what happens. Maybe go to a few parties with your friends. There are plenty of girls out there. Hang out in groups of friends. Someone will come along when you least expect it. :)<br>  <br>  Also, don't be afraid to ask for someone's number. Ask a girl you like to meet up with you for lunch, and ask for her number so you can text her when you're there. Later on text again and say you had fun and see what she says. Don't be afraid! That's how you meet people in college.|`|ZjM0ghSnaa	You got number 4 right! There's plenty of girls that you can meet, your just not looking in the right places and are surrounded in the wrong places. My sister is 21 too, and she goes to a big college. Join clubs, that's a great way to find new friends, and girls! That's how my sister started out, and she has met alot of great people, so give that a try. <br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|ZJdeXNiHaa	I have the exact same problem, sucks don't it?|`|4f99ec15a9237df0f6ae375f2cb22c55aa	Because you are MALE and live in a shitty country that hates Men. An associate of mine just left the usa to find his mate elsewhere. He is a nice guy, owns his own business. But that doesn't mean anything to women these days. Realize that women here are only going to tell you hoiw YOU have to change. Its usually the old, you dont have any confidence bull you always read. However, it doesnt reflect on the fact that the women you meet are total scum. Or how women dont have to worry about being lonely. Men are the ones who are lonely. They are also the ones who are exploited by 'online dating' and other garbage.  You just need to dump western women and find real women who still believe in family, honesty, kindness and loyalty.  Book a flight someplace and I am sure you will come back a different man.   <br>  <br>  Trust me on this one okay?  Just always remember, its NOT YOU, its them.|`|sZMa0s7Baa	I love confident guys, and I know that most other girls do too. I would find it really flattering if I was just walking on campus and a guy just walked over and started talking to me, like asking my major and where I lived and what I liked to do and stuff. The trick is being CONFIDENT about it and not creepy at all, if you are feeling shy at all it will be really awkward and then she will likely get creeped out.<br>  <br>  Or since you're 21, do you ever go out to bars? Yeah it's not the IDEAL place to meet a girlfriend, but it could help you just meet some girls in general and build up your confidence so you could find a nice girl on campus, if that's what you want :).<br>  <br>  Good luck! Feel free to email me if you need anymore advice or have any questions.
oYYblXFmaa	yes, it is wrong to do that. It's like she is stealing her sis's bf. Even though, she is 14 is too young. The only thing he is flirting with her cuz he is treating her like a young sis. It would be very awkward, even if her sis's is not going out with her bf. Sister should be very happy for her own sis.....not thinking of her sis's bf. Your friend is be concentrating on her school than thinking about dating guys. Sorry, to say this....14 is way too young....it's still a young lady ( a little girl). The guy is 19 is a teen man (teenager). It would be not a good idea. The only thing you should tell her the truth about this. If she really likes him....she should respect his choice and her sis's relationship. Treat him like a brother or some-like god friend. If both sis's is going out with the same guy......it's like cat and dog fight. Enemy. You don't want them to deal with that do you? Just confront her and tell what all you got. You are her best friend. Also...if her sis's bf cheated on her sister with her......the man is like a 2 timer....A dog. Anyway, wish you luck!|`|m2eHPeciaa	yes, but at the same time i've seen this happen before. (not me personally, im an only child) i would only say its bad b/c she's 14 and the guy is 19. HUGE age difference. (because she's soo young) tell her that she needs to find someone her own age, n not think about those things b/c she's too young. she'll have her heart broken many times and doesn't need to start now. (that's what i'd tell her)|`|DQkDQraOaa	When she asks, tell her that it's wrong. I'm sure that she knows it herself anyway.|`|fa8cA0W2aa	ooooooo yea|`|pfmkJmcwaa	You can't really help what your feelings are but most likely, she just has a crush. It takes time to fall in love. Plus she's only 14, I doubt that she's had enough relationships to really truly know what loves is. She needs to resist these feelings though. Even if he feels the same way and breaks up with her sister, things will not end up the way she wants them to. He best bet is to find someone her age and move on because she could end up hurting alot of people in the long run.|`|27fe1e3ae697035fd2660cec751b7997aa	yea thats a big noooooo noooo.  thats one thing u never mess with.... tell her that it is wrong and that its her sister;s boyfriend and eventho she isnt doing anything with the boyfriend yet... if her sis finds out about it she prolly wont ever forgive her sister... good luck.<br>  <br>  <br>  Answer mine???<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Aql6lSFDLfQ3JTZTUckbhojsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090306153258AAJkDuo">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|CzJzgeqEaa	Tell her it is wrong for two reasons he is dating already and He is 19 she is 14 Illegal.

It is not right to like your sisters boyfriend especially considering your age gap.  Its infactuation and attraction.. not love. <br>  <br>  Soon enough, your friend will have moved on and look back and find this funny. Try to convince her not to do anything to her sister and her boyfriend. <br>  <br>  Good luck with your friend. Try to get her to meet other people around your age.|`|GJ2Ibafoaa	Perhaps you could tell her that maybe it's just a crush.|`|8NpMPGDDaa	sounds like a good drama story haha<br>  she probably has a crush and just wants what her sister has|`|hsqbzIokaa	um ya duh|`|xYisIAT5aa	Um yes.

ff27c578abd6f97b50c76f87e94ae774aa	I think dating means you can be seeing multiple people. A date is like going out to eat or to the movies. You may not even consider yourselves "going out". But being in an exclusive relationship means you are only seeing each other and it is much more serious. I think it does mean different things to different people, just like losing your virginity means different things to different people (like some say if you've only had oral, you're still a virgin, others say you're not, etc.)

AA11263103	*Wait for the right moment.*<br>  There’s usually no hurry for a kiss, especially a first kiss with someone, so be patient and wait until the mood is right. Some good times are at a romantic movie after or during an on screen kiss, walking in the moonlight, or during a particularly intimate conversation. Wait until the two of you are alone so that the other person will feel more comfortable and so that nobody will see if your attempt to kiss is rejected. Many girls (and guys) don't want to be asked: they prefer that you be confident enough to take a risk and just go for it. One way to do so is to stop whatever you’re doing and silently look into the person’s eyes for a moment or two. Touch their face, then gently pull him/her toward you for a kiss. If the person pulls away or hesitates at any time, he or she is not ready for a kiss. If this happens, tell them that you want to give them a hug and go for that.<br>  <br>  *Approach for the kiss.*<br>  Approach slowly and smoothly. Depending on your starting position you may need only to turn your head, or you may need to lean in a bit. You may want to use your hands to gently urge your partner’s body or head into position—you just want to guide his or her movement a little, you don’t want to forcibly move any part of his or her body or hold your partner in an uncomfortable position—but in general you just want to position yourself correctly and let your partner meet you. As you near your partner’s lips, maintain eye contact. You may want to close your eyes after your lips meet to heighten the sensuality of the kiss (and to avoid staring at the pores on his or her face).<br>  <br>  *Kiss gently.*<br>  There are many kinds of kisses, from quick pecks to sweet, passionate kisses. There’s a time and place for all of these, but your first kiss with someone should be gentle and romantic. Don’t press your mouth onto your partner’s--just let your lips meet--and don’t try to push your tongue into his or her mouth. When your lips meet, pucker them and give a kiss, then smile and pull away a little, keeping your head close to your partner’s. If your partner moves to kiss you back or seems to like it and doesn’t pull away, go in for another kiss, this one a little firmer and longer. Put your hands on their face or around their shoulders.<br>  <br>  *Make the kiss the reason for the kiss.* <br>  Some people seem to treat kisses as nothing more than a prelude to something else, and will try to quickly move into French kissing. Good kissers concentrate on the kiss, and they kiss, at least seemingly, expecting nothing more. Enjoy the experience, and don’t move too fast. Live in the moment. You will not kiss as well if your mind is somewhere else. For example, when kissing, try to avoid thoughts like "What is he/she thinking about?", "Do I look good tonight?", or anything else. Don't be too self-conscious, or have ANY thoughts outside the kiss if you can help it. Instead, concentrate on the way the other person's lips feel against yours.|`|F0d1bOxgaa	I am thirteen and I have never kissed a guy...i think that it would just happen  and you would know what to do.|`|Nhi8cxAvaa	Just wait. Please.|`|QTnUaLpIaa	im 13 too and ive kissed a guy<br>  it was weird but i just went along with it<br>  idk how though|`|sKD7o004aa	Hello i am 13 as well and i have never kissed a boy...I am nervous and am sure that i will mess up the first time... :)
duyetA3Jaa	Yeah if you do it in a flirty way I would personally think it'd be cute, and i'd flirt back.|`|ww3ukbdVaa	JUST SAY THAT OMG. =D say exactly that :P|`|9c16f104f9589fa27971d779def0ac39aa	How about saying Hello and not playing stupid.|`|fzLnapcZaa	Thats actualy kinda funny cuase the same exact thing happened to me like w month ago. what i did is when we were talking we echanged phone numbers and i said "can i have a pic of you for my contacts" and he said sure and then asked for one of me.(i knew he would want a picture in return)  now he dosnt stare at me as much and were now closer freinds. so if u want try what i did it might work. hope i helped :)|`|3BsddZ9taa	just ignore... let him always have glances... untill he comes and speaks to you just live it off, definately nothing going to happen,, when he does down to speak... prepare earlier exactly what you want to say...|`|wHgBnMipaa	Maybe, "Like what you see?"|`|bQTFX54waa	like anything you see?<br>  lmao|`|ZPnPbnHpaa	wow a lot of the answers you got are kind of mean. im sorry. i see where your comming from becasue that happens to me a lot too. I don't really know what your like, but you could first make sure you look super hott, then go up to him and say "Hi im ______. Do you get this?" show him classwork or whatever. He helps you when he's done say "Thanks a million you are a life savor!" if he really likes you he will take the hint. don't be mean or say some cheesy pick up line. Just be yourself. :) good-luck chicka (i could really use 10 points right about now! ) :) :) :)|`|nfRoYBwwaa	Oh no you don't say wanna say something too sassy!No....don't do that. That will make him back off. Go over and say,"Hi,I noticed you staring..and I'm just wondering if I have something on me..."Then smile a little and make your eyes very questionable! Okay then he is bound to say something cute!Then you blush and reply something very charming.<br>  <br>  Be charming. Be out there.Be  Relaxed!.;)<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|gX3MeosXaa	"Hi I notice you look at me a lot & if you want we can set up a time for you to take a photo with me posing for you." Then wink & turn away.|`|hprR6qfHaa	sounds like you are not very witty.  if you pretend that you are, he will eventually find out, and you will look even worse.  just be yourself.  tell him your name or something.|`|BD1f6s3Gaa	just go talk to him you don't have to impress him because he obviously already likes you.|`|vhyjeXPhaa	just stare at him and smile back <br>  my dad does it to everyone that stares and they all turn around embarrassed that they got caught|`|WQiTQGdBaa	Whatever you say, don't be mean or play "hard to get" because it seems like he likes you too, so you should be honest.|`|0WlLGPKHaa	If you want to be modest say something like, "There are better things to stare at then me."|`|lOZlcOsIaa	youre probably terribly ugly and you have no chance<br>  get used to rejection
ML3PGUPYaa	military is a tough thing to handle..when one "family" member is in it, you really all are..i mean minus the whole first person thing...so yes,i regret im saying this because i actually have a girlfriend and will be leaving for the naval academy soon, but you did do the correct thing. its tough on the both of you, however with that said there is nothing impossible if you guys want to really stick each other, you can make it work out somehow. good luck|`|aQTOAmZcaa	It seems like you have a lot of stuff on your shoulders right now, and even though you may love him.. It sounds like to me you need some YOU time. Get things together for yourself. And  let him get things together for himself.<br>  <br>  I think you did the right thing. Trust me, things will work out for themselves..but for now, just worry about you hun.|`|mnWaURXraa	yes . Your both still young and have a lot of time to live, move to your new place and get to know the people in your new community.<br>  and keep in touch with each other when you can. <br>  Take it one day at a time and don't worry. Time will catch up with time and you'll know what to do then.|`|2nPwq257aa	As long as your not cheating or planning on it, you definitely did the right thing.|`|R60QaZ4Raa	I think you did the right thing. I mean some people would have been selfish and not said anything. I think the balls in his court now. But ultimately if he says he only wants to be with you then you need to really think about whats best for you, stress is never a good thing. And without contact things can get messy. Also and not trying to rain on the parade if he says he only wants you. Temptation is always lurking around the Corner [for both of you]. Also you need to clarify other people, that could mean date you and others or just others. You really seem responsible for taking it on you to bring this up.<br>  <br>  Best of luck with whatever is decided. <br>  <br>  Sorry I couldn't be of much help.
Rq8YGaHAaa	Yeah, it's ok. I would probably say yes if somebody asked me like that.|`|dYN0iHvyaa	try leading up to it with a little bit of conversation first. talk about the class, like maybe an upcoming test or ask her if she understands some topic. then ask if she wants to study together or get coffee or whatever. if you're too abrupt you might catch her off guard.|`|AA10415431	It is absolutely okay, you've got to start somewhere. I'd start with studying. You'll get to know her study habits and she'll open up. You may find you don't even like her, if her study habits are bad.|`|Mv0NRYRhaa	Thats totally cool if she doesnt know you this gives her the chance its always good to talk to new people you never know you may find that you like her and vice versa|`|HuGNlw2naa	it ok go for it and good luck|`|F3LBgfvwaa	yeah dude there is nothing wrong with that|`|xoXkHOVsaa	It's a big risk.  If you creep her out, then you will never have a chance with her.  I would try to actually have a conversation before you ask her to do something with you.|`|8JU1hxZ1aa	yep its fine,<br>  <br>  It's not too serious or pushy, and but she will more then likely be quite flattered :) Go for it :)|`|54vt2jXRaa	Sure it's okay.  Go for it.|`|366q2mlUaa	yes! how do you think relationships start if you dont talk to someone!|`|UplpiqdCaa	sure<br>  i don't see the problem
37M3dkkRaa	i wouldn't date. what happens if you find THE ONE and then you die? i mean obviously the other person is going to be hurting emotionally, maybe even physically because they miss you so much. there's no point in making anyone's life harder than it has to be. in this situation you have to think of other people's feelings as well as your own and make a decision that you think is best for both parties. i'm not saying dating would be wrong, but i'm saying i wouldn't do it. because if you really care about someone you wouldn't want them to get hurt in any way, especially at your cost. and people are something you can not replace.|`|2tn8EALqaa	sounds like every person on earth, not knowing when you'll die...|`|DVET41lcaa	Wow ...I am so very sorry to hear about your cousin. That is really truely sad. But in my opinion..I say yes..she can still begin a relationship. She might be able to live another 20 years...you never really know. She should be able to enjoy it like everyone else and let nothing stop her.Nothing can stop love...not even cancer ; ]<br>  <br>  I wish your cousin the best.|`|wHgBnMipaa	I know this is cheesy, but I always felt like I would act the way the couple acts in A Walk to Remember.  We only get one life to live, and I believe lives ought to be lived to the fullest.|`|ecd5b22a3f931f907d69a5b7daa4b25caa	why not every one deserves love|`|Qzhb7zYEaa	I"d make the most i can out of my life.<br>  <br>  and even when i perish i'll have made an impact on that person atleast.|`|pfisYml0aa	w/o reading it all, yes, i would......and cherish every moment. we all have a terminal illness....we all gotta go sometime, she just knows when and how.
091LTWTCaa	when you talk to him, get really close to him and whisper something in his ear, hold his hand...he should get the hint!! If not, you may have a shy one on your hands and might have to make the first move.|`|zprAkP3eaa	When you feel like you can't hold it any longer then make your move, just do it, he will like it.|`|vwoqIUR6aa	yes when you hug him jus lean in to him and kiss him on the lips-keep your lips pressed and maybe it will lead to a nice kiss|`|y46FXf62aa	If you have not find the right time to kiss in 2 months, It is time to run because that is what will eventually happen. If he have not made the move, he may be just scare. i just hope you don't look like resbusia from norbit or he is not gay.|`|9jiHVKpOaa	you shouldn't have to make the move.. he should be the one to make it|`|ML3PGUPYaa	post age...all depends on that.|`|9858433a42069408a92062d33417597aaa	Well its up to you. No one knows your relationship better than the both of you.<br>  Talk to him about it? <br>  Two months seems long, but maybe your relationship isn't too focused on phyisical aspects. WHICH IS A GOOD THING.<br>  <br>  and another word of advice: stop using chatspeak!|`|b60a7cac55e2e3c6b01466b293550026aa	I think it is to soon.  You should take time to get to know him better.  Find out what you have in common and enjoy those things.  You should date other people and see if they are more your type.  It is the only way to know, for sure, if he is worthy of  your saliva.  Ask yourself, "is this what Jesus would do?".  I don't think Jesus would kiss a boy.  That is for his priests.|`|XE9p3Oumaa	The only real advice I can give you is that you have to decide for yourself. Does he feel right for it, do you? He might be waiting for you to? Maybe he is not sure whether you are ready yet.|`|a7LvtYi0aa	uhh maybe you should just get him alone on time and look into his eyes and just get closer to him and see if he pulls in.|`|2Ph9ZejBaa	Dont ask, just do, that will catch off guard and believe me, he wont resist, unless he's gay ;)|`|ngsbRZENaa	Get him drunk.
duyetA3Jaa	Kurt's a bastard!!!  I like you :)|`|QMsLWrSpaa	Move on g
YWdNTZU3aa	yeah your really cute<br>  beautiful smile|`|ecd5b22a3f931f907d69a5b7daa4b25caa	why are you asking this because you're beautiful!|`|B7idbFNVaa	PRETTY but am getting the SENSE that you are SHY and INSURE from the picture.|`|zBmno58kaa	Yes, you're cute and you look sweet, too.|`|224598c2e3c1d07cad06c082f551c456aa	yea but i hope that was halloween with the dress|`|cSPxoFe6aa	no|`|49vO7HWIaa	Your very attractive, however, I could barely see the color of your eyes. I bet you look amazing in person. I'm planning a trip to Sydney soon, any recommendations on the club/bar scene there?|`|QkkKs9Veaa	I think you really pretty. <br>  be confident on yourself(:|`|SIuVuA1Taa	Cant see you
27b0dc152d8cb508cc723b372dc58c91aa	aww he sounds like a really caring guy...he only wants you to stay away because he doesnt want to end up hurting you...when life goes bad its not always easy to control your feelings and hes scared that hes not stable enough to be in a relationship yet....afterall to first act ok to other people you have to be ok with yourself...i think he wants you to be his gf, he just needs some time to figure his life out first
AA11150213	Honestly I think he is the confused one, it seems like he doesn't know what he really want.<br>  <br>  Since you are interested in him, then maybe you should talk to him and find out where things are going. If he still seems confused than keep it moving, don't waste your time.
091LTWTCaa	I'd say keep it to casual dating if you don't want to offend her. But make it clear so she doesn't get jealous and mad when she sees you flirting with other girls.|`|517360c1a1db979fb2f19bbb959f22eaaa	Going on a date or to the prom does not mean that you're dating. <br>  <br>  When you "date", you and the girl have been going out casually and then you start thinking that maybe there's a possible long term relationship here. If you both think that, then in order to try to make a go of it, you agree not to date other people, until you decide otherwise. Then you either continue or break up.|`|SgKsHxD5aa	we dont know you<br>  we dont know her<br>  we dont know either of your dating reputations..<br>  <br>  were strangers. dont ask us.|`|aXOyK3uBaa	NOTHING WRONG WITH BEING SELFISH OR COCKY.<br>  So don't apologize for that.<br>  <br>  Girls are selfish ALL THE TIME. They actually get MAD when their boyfriends don't bend over backwards on Valentine's Day... while they do absolutely NOTHING for their own boyfriends.<br>  <br>  They want flowers, and dinners, and compliments, and guys to treat them "nice" no matter what, who will worship and adore them for no reason.<br>  <br>  THAT'S SELFISH.<br>  <br>  A "relationship" is not something you should EVER get into for at least 3- 6 months. When you are NOT in a relationship, you can have all the sex you want.,... go out with whoever you want..... and NEVER have to apologize for it.<br>  <br>  Isn't that awesome?<br>  <br>  You should ALWAYS try and keep yourself available for a girl you MAY eventually want to get into a relationship WITH......so don't lock yourself into one.... ESPECIALLY before you spend LOTS OF GOOD TIMES with a girl -->> INCLUDING SEX.<br>  <br>  Think about it.,<br>  <br>  Cheers.|`|KjF0p72naa	first-going to a prom together does NOT make you a couple<br>  second-if you ask ONE person to go with you, stick to that ONE person the whole night, otherwise go solo and hope some other chicks do too bc you mackin on another dudes date wont work out for ya<br>  third-if you are thinking this pig-headed way, leave her OUT of it!|`|RnQFwIuUaa	When you ask someone to a dance, it is expected that you don't flirt or dance with other girls. Unless you have an understanding with her that you both can dance/flirt with others, it is not accepted.|`|zprAkP3eaa	If you would like to still dance and flirt with others then no, you should stay single!|`|oEfnqmp3aa	It sounds tough at first, but your position's not really quite so bad. The short answer is yes. You make it sound like there's only two positions, either "open" or "boyfriend and girlfriend". That is not the case.<br>  <br>  A relationship is progressive. Being "closer than just friends" is not yet the point of being mutually for each other. In your position, you can go on ahead and be responsive to her behavior and flirtatious with her. That is still in the class of social interaction rather than behavior between lovers.|`|dvX11ttNaa	No, you can't flirt with other girls if she is your girlfriend! That's disrespectful, and would cause her to have a horrible prom night. Don't ruin her prom, and you'll just end up brealing up! In my opinion, your not ready for a girlfriend, a girlfrined is somebody you are loyal to.<br>  <br>  Good luck! <3|`|lOR7CH0waa	You should go out with her, but at prom, don't flirt with other girls, but you can dance with them. (Only if they ask! Don't ask them! That would hurt your girl's feelings a lot! It would put a damper on her self-esteem,too.)|`|l7E3EreXaa	if you wanna have a crappy prom, sure, go and dance with other girls as well. But if you two aren't dating then she can't get too mad...but she will. Don't dance on that minefield.|`|WtElgJDtaa	if youre gonna flirt with other girls dont even think about getting into a relationship with that girl...shell get mad at you.|`|M9iseki5aa	no|`|rUjUmXNjaa	yep|`|iKjRrcDoaa	first of all if your going to prom with her then why not? she might not be the right person at first but im sure your young so you still have a lot of time. So my response to that question is yes and if you try to, if you can, bring a pack of gum and ask her if she wants a piece and if she is interested and takes a piece then possibly you two might work out. if she is interested then make a nice comment about something like maybe her shoes and if she gives you about a 2-3 word response then that's the time when you should look for other girls. but if she gives a longer response then i think you should ask her out. I hope this info helps.|`|wNoaxTX7aa	eh... if she really likes you she might get jealous and be wierd the rest of the niight. but maybe she doesnt like you that much to care and it will be a great night. heeh.|`|g0TLTjCjaa	Yeah you can still dance and flirt with other girls mate - but only if she isn't clingy as hell! Just make sure she understands its all good humoured and that you're not out to pull every bird in the room!|`|YIJRZhoSaa	I have a question: HOW old are you?<br>  If you are older than 18, I think you should get it.<br>  if not, just keep your emotion.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.doreplica.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.doreplica.com</a>|`|AA11732721	Maybe.|`|uSDb8fBpaa	nope prom will be your big test but it will be worth it ;3 trust me<br>  <br>  something about the feeling of prom|`|jyTRBlVUaa	Yes
nyHnYT4uaa	There's no for sure way to tell if he really likes you unless you ask. You should ask him at least whats wrong first and then ask him out. I doubt hes too good for you, and even if he is he really won't care unless hes immature. Most guys (including myself) aren't good enough for the girls we date.|`|JBECY23daa	he totally likes you girl so go talk to him and see how he really feels.
wHgBnMipaa	You know what he's interested in already, so get him something that you know he'll like.  Maybe a t-shirt with a favorite band or a Pokemon character on it?  Some sort of memorabilia might work, too.  Make sure you make him a homemade card, too.  It just makes things more personal!|`|5sTPhPGiaa	The original "Star Wars" trilogy on DVD!|`|B4oZJkc4aa	OMG! Tell him to get Regigigas @ Toys R Us!|`|JMiIjqyGaa	A fleshlight. He will worship you, my dear.|`|6sBn3l3Maa	I would get him a CD of his favorite band.<br>  Considering you two haven't been together for a while, I suggest buying simple things first. After time, more expensive and deep things.|`|F0uLexezaa	a GPS|`|2b4cf122bf028b6f310138970448a801aa	Don't get him anything big at all since you just started dating. Maybe a good cd. There's no need to go all out yet
fPpmgxjuaa	see if she remembers if not...let her go...cuz she obviously dont care enuff bout the relationship enuff to remember that...mayb she's jus got a surprise for you and wants you to think that...u never kno...but if she does thats pretty f'd up..|`|dqw1iH6haa	wat a meanie|`|8zvGi6yNaa	Say"ummmm babe...aren't you forgetting something"and if that doesen't remind her<br>  say"our anniversary"|`|ed9248042408189d059a06605d257603aa	She's probably trying to see if you remember. Let her know that you care about the anniversary too. Make her feel special.|`|TAMGy07Daa	tell her, its your 1 year anniversary....|`|x1FzJLwZaa	maybe she is just testing you if you remember or not..|`|TiZEswxYaa	tell her duh|`|pFeKIbjkaa	Remind her.<br>  <br>       'Hey baby.

YbnEr1z7aa	well he could be nervous, he could really like you ;P  he could think it is like the best hes had. i know my ears get read whenever i get my blood drawn... maybe it could be the blood pumping fast and hard...|`|a87POYvAaa	he likes it haha, my ears turn red everytime i kiss with my gf. its a very intimate thing. turns me on too...|`|pt5uwj5raa	heat escapes from your feet and ears. he's probably just getting a good workout.

8Zy7SOlkaa	lady he  was trying to get a response from you, here you mentioned that you started the fight, isn't it quite clear that he was doing so cause he wants you to feel guilty and you to beg forgiveness, it is almost typical guy nature, they start playing hard to get cause they want you to feel the pain of being away from him, see just go to him, speak to him about it, tell him you are really sorry and that you want to be back with him ( i.e. if you want to be back).|`|KhyPqoFIaa	Hello there <br>  I am the surfer<br>  <br>  From my experience i can say he needs to see that you miss him! that′s why he stares at you from time to time <br>  <br>  He does not have emotional maturity to admit his feelings over you, <br>  He does not wants to be vulnerable and in the open <br>  He is hurt and does not know how to deal with it<br>  The fact that he asked for his already done papers means he was testing waters and intents to move on!<br>  <br>  It was normal for you to want him back but his lack of respect is indication about his lack of character i would explain better trough this rule<br>  <br>  Relationships are the R formula Responsibility, Respect, Romance, to treat you like Royalty, Reciprocity and Real feelings there <br>  therefore you do not have a future with him if he jumps from the ship at the first sight of iceberg!<br>  Do move on!<br>  <br>  When i was a freshman from law school i use to like a girl , but she said that she was with  her last bf because he remembered her of the first one, like guy number 2 was a clone from guy number 1 so for  me that was end of the deal i did not talked to her anymore and she got shy , rejected and offended towards me  <br>  <br>  From the surfer!|`|X4i2jej5aa	I think you should talk to him yourself, ask what's the deal with him always making excuses to see you. Is he trying to be a man and not face the fact that he still has feelings for you? Talk to him, make him tell you, that's the key to fix your problems. <br>  Good-Luck.

HKVFVS4qaa	You know, it isn't always like in the movies, where guys are naturally talented in asking girls (or guys) out on dates.<br>  Some (I would venture to say most) males are more embarrassed than you would think.<br>  Now, if you know he likes you, then yes, just ask him out.<br>  But if you aren't quite sure yet, try hanging out with him + friends.<br>  Then, eventually, you can start evaluating the probability of him accepting.<br>  Which I would say is pretty high, because I think most guys would say yes (even if it just to not hurt your feelings), at least for a first date.<br>  If he says no for even one date, either leave him alone, or wait until he comes to you.<br>  So, the final verdict: Butter him up with friends around you (not to make it too suspicious ;-)   ] and then ask him out eventually.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Why do girls feel compelled to answer these questions?|`|tCq1xpqraa	ive talked to some guys about it and they say its ok cuz it takes pressure off them. i think that its ok too, "but if the guy doesnt ask he either isnt man enuff or doesnt want to focus on the girl, either way he aint the guy for u" (dont ask where i read that)|`|10ynxgdmaa	yeah go 4 it he wil think u r brave 4 making the 1st move that is what i do all the time n i got one of my best friends guy that way so go 4b it hope this helps!!!!!|`|4qiiuv6Xaa	Just start flirting and don't ask him out.

They offer the opportunity for the development of trust based on voluntary commitments and an intensified intimacy. Where achieved and relatively secure, such trust is psychologically stabilising, because of the strong connections between basic trust and the reliability of caretaking figures. Given that these connections embrace feelings of security in the object-world, as well as in the sphere of personal relations as such, their importance is very considerable. The pure relationship is a key environment for building the reflexive project of the self, since it both allows for and demands organised and continuous self-understanding -- the means of securing a durable tie to the other. Of course, many actual relationships exist and endure where little symmetry is found, and where each person is held in thrall by traits in the other which on the surface repel them (co-dependency). But the tendencies towards symmetry in the pure relationship are more than just an ideal: they are in large degree inherent in its nature.<br>   To be in an authentic relation with another can be a major source of moral support, again largely because of its potential integration with basic trust. But shorn of external moral criteria, the pure relationship is vulnerable as a source of security at fateful moments and at other major life transitions.|`|B1RVJOBcaa	One that includes <br>  Understanding <br>  Honesty<br>  Love <br>  Pride<br>  That !*SPARK!*<br>  (There's probably more but these are the biggest)|`|XwyUATsKaa	In some religious circles it means no sex, kissing, touching, anything until marriage.|`|w2hxmOLwaa	based on true pure love when its not about sex or fun, when you love the person and don't need another boy/girl|`|YIJRZhoSaa	I have a friend, the relationship is pure, but I don't know how to detail it.

xoXkHOVsaa	Don't read too much in to it.  If she only sees you in the hallway, I doubt her feelings are as strong as yours, if she has any at all.<br>  <br>  You are just going to have to find a way to talk to her.  Start slow, just have conversations as friends.  She doesn't know anything about you, so don't come on too strong.
VDXiS91aaa	You could do a couple things. You could talk about it, which is nice and honest, but could be a difficult/awkward conversation to start.

NzBjnqztaa	Don't stop caring, don't confront, just don't do anything. They're not good enough to be your friends.
EJMwqU3caa	When I was in high school, my best friend and another friend woke up one morning and decided that they didn't want to be friends with me anymore, for litterally no reason at all.  It hurt bad.  The worst part was that the 2 of them hated each other till I made them get to know each other better.  They completely stopped all contact with me.  I became the "dorky" kid that had to eat lunch alone.  Anyway.  Teenagers can be very hurtful and selfish.  I'm sorry you are a "victim" of their idiotic behavior.  I know this seems like the end of the world, but you will get through this.  <br>  The best advise I can give you is to just take a deep breath, pray, and go on with your day.  Maybe take some "me time" and catch up on your studies.  Do some inner thinking about what you want out of life.  It will be hard at first, but you WILL make new friends.  I promise.  Take chances and talk to other people, find a way to strike up a conversation with someone who interests you.  The worst thing you can do is to do nothing - because then nothing will change.  And remember, even if you feel alone, God is always with you and He will help you go through this.  You just have to ask.<br>  <br>  Good Luck to you. :)  <br>  <br>  Oh yea, one more thing - remember to smile...  you just might brighten someone else's day, as well as your own!|`|duyetA3Jaa	I'm sorry to hear that your so-called friends treat you like that.  Usually it's out of jealousy.  I've had friends use me, but I have also used them.  There are many people who I hang out with, but only a handful that I would consider good friends.  As long as you have one person who is your true friend, which it sounds like you do, then you'll be fine.  Give it time, and either your old friends will come crawling back, or you'll make new better friends.|`|Cwmb0tJJaa	You'll find especially as you get older that sometimes for no obvious reason some people just do not click. Personalities are constantly clashing. Don't be petty by giving them the cold shoulder or stirring up the drama by confronting them. Just accept that some people will never like you and you will never like certain people. Make up your mind to rise above all the nonsense and move on. Life is too short to worry about the convoluted thoughts and feelings of others. Enjoy the company of your real friends and let everything else roll off your shoulders.|`|JBECY23daa	i have been here before girl all you do is remember who your real friends are and its your bestie she seems like she would never hurt you but hey keep your head up they will get hurt twice as bad and when they do you and laugh and say how does it feel.
yzxDvRzUaa	it sounds like a bad thing. if she looked shocked and then always whispers things to her friends when you are walking by then she probably doesn't feel the same and just wants to be friends so ask her if you can just go back to being friends
xoXkHOVsaa	Never. EVER. If they hit you once, they will do it again.|`|4PKpQVxEaa	Never. I've always wondering about that too. I have my reasons too, but I don't really feel like stating that on Y!A<br>  <br>  Question is, would you?|`|F08qx2hgaa	No. I deserve much better than that. Everyone does!<br>  <br>  No one should feel the need and dependency to stay in, or go back to, an abusive relationship.<br>  <br>  The thing is, there are disorders that people can get that makes them so very afraid of leaving someone who "loves" them.
KjF0p72naa	tomorrow isnt promised. and once youve lost love and can never have it back...youll see things in a way where so much little crap does not and will not ever matter again.
uRbeSOMwaa	just tell him, but be nice about it.. say "i really love you as a friend but nothing more.<br>  is that ok with you?"|`|S1PtV8h2aa	Just tell him<br>  if he still doesn't get the message, you can<br>  1. get a close guy friend to pretend to be your boyfriend.<br>  2. Avoid him or don't talk to him as much. Eventually he'll catch on.<br>  3. talk about how you find another guy attractive/hot/cute etc. in front of him|`|QTysjfgPaa	Be nice about it just say<br>  I love you as a friend you are really special to me and i dont want to lose you, but im just really not interested in you in that way, i feel horrible saying this, but im sorry, i hope youre okay?<br>  or something like that idk lol|`|ezI5HwRWaa	Tell him in a nice way. Don't lead him on (no flirting with him or making him believe he has a chance with you.) Help find your friend a girlfriend.<br>  <br>  Don't talk about other guys a lot or pretend to have a boyfriend unless you absolutely have to because that would really hurt your friend. :(

Some good times are at a romantic movie after or during an on screen kiss, walking in the moonlight, or during a particularly intimate conversation. Wait until the two of you are alone so that the other person will feel more comfortable and so that nobody will see if your attempt to kiss is rejected. Many girls (and guys) don't want to be asked: they prefer that you be confident enough to take a risk and just go for it. One way to do so is to stop whatever you’re doing and silently look into the person’s eyes for a moment or two. Touch their face, then gently pull him/her toward you for a kiss. If the person pulls away or hesitates at any time, he or she is not ready for a kiss. If this happens, tell them that you want to give them a hug and go for that.<br>  <br>  *Approach for the kiss.*<br>  Approach slowly and smoothly. Depending on your starting position you may need only to turn your head, or you may need to lean in a bit. You may want to use your hands to gently urge your partner’s body or head into position—you just want to guide his or her movement a little, you don’t want to forcibly move any part of his or her body or hold your partner in an uncomfortable position—but in general you just want to position yourself correctly and let your partner meet you. As you near your partner’s lips, maintain eye contact. You may want to close your eyes after your lips meet to heighten the sensuality of the kiss (and to avoid staring at the pores on his or her face).<br>  <br>  *Kiss gently.*<br>  There are many kinds of kisses, from quick pecks to sweet, passionate kisses. There’s a time and place for all of these, but your first kiss with someone should be gentle and romantic. Don’t press your mouth onto your partner’s--just let your lips meet--and don’t try to push your tongue into his or her mouth. When your lips meet, pucker them and give a kiss, then smile and pull away a little, keeping your head close to your partner’s. If your partner moves to kiss you back or seems to like it and doesn’t pull away, go in for another kiss, this one a little firmer and longer. Put your hands on their face or around their shoulders.<br>  <br>  *Make the kiss the reason for the kiss.* <br>  Some people seem to treat kisses as nothing more than a prelude to something else, and will try to quickly move into French kissing. Good kissers concentrate on the kiss, and they kiss, at least seemingly, expecting nothing more. Enjoy the experience, and don’t move too fast. Live in the moment. You will not kiss as well if your mind is somewhere else. For example, when kissing, try to avoid thoughts like "What is he/she thinking about?", "Do I look good tonight?", or anything else. Don't be too self-conscious, or have ANY thoughts outside the kiss if you can help it. Instead, concentrate on the way the other person's lips feel against yours.|`|2tavXc37aa	follow the flowww

4PKpQVxEaa	There really is no way to ask him without it being awkward. I think it'd be best for you to just sit him down and look him in the eyes and ask him. If he really trusts you he'll come out to you for real.<br>  <br>  And, just because he doesn't look gay/bi doesn't mean that he isn't. I have a gay best friend who looks 100% straight and he's super gay. He's not feminine at all and sometimes I forget that he is gay.<br>  <br>  Oh, and when you do ask him it'd really help if you told him that you're comfortable with whatever his orientation is and that you'll always be there to support him. Nobody wants to feel like they have to hide themselves from their friends, trust me.|`|AhBJT5xFaa	He may be bisexual.. but just nervous to completley express it.

Which is really good because most guys are not.<br>  <br>  When you have time to talk and you know no one is going to interrupt you just say "Hey man, I'm pretty sure what I heard you say the other day and if you want to talk about it I'm fine with it." That leaves the ball in his court, if he's comfortable enough about it, he'll talk to you. If he's not ready yet, just wait it out. Eventually he will and be sure not to push it. Coming out is a big deal. Especially to other friends who are straight.|`|4gQgLlYQaa	ehh thats a tuffy<br>  well maybe you should<br>  joke around w/ him & be like<br>  "bro we homos fo life"<-that might be a lil weird<br>  or even ask him *jokingly* "dude what if i told<br>  you i was gay" just to see what his reaction is<br>  & make sure you clear it up so that he knows your joking<br>  or the next time he pulls a "I'm bi" on you,<br>  make sure hes just joking & be serious about it|`|ZoPPQ5yraa	try to ask him nicely<<but i think he might be  bisexual>>>>|`|Oj1ac4Kuaa	I think that if you think is a good friend don′t worry. He won′t betray you.|`|PJ1VFAxYaa	Just wait and when he is ready again, pay attention and he will let you know...I don't recommend asking because he may flip out...so just let him tell you when he is ready.|`|fxF2oraPaa	lol, dude, that was a the gayest thing that i've ever heard of in my life!!!!!!!!|`|M9iseki5aa	sounds kinds queer to me...lololol|`|6fjrcdYjaa	Ask him. Flat out. I've had to do it before. It takes courage, but you'll get an answer. And, even if he says no, you'll know he is by the way he says it. Straight guys typically get ANGRY at the question and will ask "Why in the world you'd ask that" or even use horrible names like, "I'm no FAG" or whatever. Gay/Bi guys will be like, "nooo"... probably with a smile or, at least, say it calmly. <br>  <br>  Just ask him! IF he's not and he get's mad at you, remind him that he flat out said it the other day! But, I don't know of ANY of my straight guy friends who would even JOKE like they were gay... so...<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|KbbL1Wemaa	I would start out by approaching him and saying something like, "So about what you said the other day, I want to make sure I didn't misunderstand you."  If he did say "I'm bi" he will probably know what you are talking about.  If he doesn't react, I'd wait awhile and approach the situation again. You could assure him by saying it doesn't bother you in the slightest and that you are supportive of him (assuming you are).  If it makes you uncomfortable to speak with him in person, an email never hurt anyone, and it'd also give you time to think while you talk.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps a little!|`|I6dcRgD6aa	You can't tell by how a person looks or acts cause there are all kinds of ways they can be....I would just go up to him & say "Bye" & walk away & say OK I didn't hear what you said the other day so start over & tell me what you said again. Did I hear you right? He might say "what do you think I said?" & tell him that you thought he told you he was bi so is that it?...then tell him you are glad he was able to be honest with you & if you don't know what you think then just start from that.|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	He just wants attention, run from him

awLr3uCaaa	I like really down-to-earth girls. Not preppy, not overly girly, just chill. My dream girl would not shy away in the morning when I tell her she looks beautiful even though she doesn't have make-up on. Confidence. Also, one that doens't cost so much. I'm chill with going out, but I would much rather stay home, watch a movie, and cuddle. I think this is going to be different for everyone. :-)|`|EuJTvGkxaa	I deffinetly don't like emo/goth girls because they are all really weird. Always wearing weird cloths I would hate to be friends with someone like that. I know that sounds horrible but it is honestly how I and all not emo/goth guys feel. Goth ppl are in their own weird circle<br>  <br>  Not a really girly girl either because a girly girl is generally not to bright and preppy.<br>  <br>  Girls who like to do guy stuff like football are deffinetly good.

Normal to me means a girl who likes to have fun and hang out with dudes but not flirt with them.<br>  <br>  I would go for normal|`|RnQFwIuUaa	Guys like different things.

All is fair in love and war. Play the field if the girls will allow this and don't have sex, that is what binds you and causes problems.  But don't stay with someone you are not sure of.  I would be truthful with the one you are leaving though.  Tell her maybe through a letter what you are planning and tell her you like her but have some strong feelings for the other one.  Tell her it might not work out and will she take you back.  If she says no, then move on.  Cast your line back to sea and fish again.|`|y7uuuuOuaa	If you're not married then don't worry about it.

3EcHYvtUaa	I think the best path here is to become friends with both and keep it that way for a while.  This way you can get to know if the first girls is deeply involved with her bf and you can be a good frined to her if she needs it.  Same goes for the second girl.  You share running in common and this could be a good start in your friendship.  It can always be awkward if you jump from one girl to the other especially if they are both friends....

duyetA3Jaa	Well you have to take an active role in your love life.  You can't expect to find your one true love unless you put yourself out there for her to find you.  I know it can be lonely, but you're young.  You should concentrate on work and school.  Don't be in such a hurry, you have plenty of time.

My true love did come along about 10 years later and we both knew it when we saw each other--love at first sight--but then there had to be the divorces and all that mess and upheaval.  I think it makes a big difference if and when you go to college or start to work and get out on your own and start to mingle more with people in your age group who have similar interests.  She's not going to come knocking at your door, though, so get out there and stop being so shy and see who you meet.  I did date alot when I was in high school, but it was a small town and things were different.  Ask the Lord to show you the way to a happy, fulfilling life with a family and prosperity.

Man, you are just starting.  The next 5 to 10 years of your life is going bring about so much change you won't even realize it until you look in the mirror one day and see someone you barely recognize.  <br>  <br>  Now then, one word: college.  These are the years where you'll decide on what type of person you'll become due to a ton of life experiences you never had to face as a teen; some good, some bad.  Personally, I think you have what plagues a lot of young adults your age: a lack of confidence.  Built that confidence, learn how to assert yourself when dealing with the opposite sex (takes some time and practice), then go fishing!  Forget all the soul mate/true love fantasy talk.  There's a small window in time in which any two people can end up together; we're not all that different.  Look at it this way, if true love really existed, there wouldn't be a 75% divorce rate.  Advice: stop worrying and just live life.  You'll be fine as long as you take a risk every now and then.  Remember, just be assertive.|`|ZPA9RAZMaa	Dress well, be a gentleman, and the girls will fall for you.  Go to places where you're likely to meet girls - coffee shops, dance classes, even libraries.

I've dated a handful of guys, but none that I could imagine myself in the future with.  I'm the sort to want a long relationship, not a party hook up (signs I've read far too many fairy-tale romance books like Twilight, haha).  I think I would prefer to wait for the right one than flit around between guys like they're expendable.  For now, I'm enjoying single life, but it would be nice to have someone else provided they were the right one, not just a convenient fling.|`|eevOrwypaa	I think love will find you when it is time for you to have love in your life. I believe some people are ready for true love at a young age, while others are not ready until they are older. I think this happens to a lot ot people, two of my best friends haven't had a boyfriend or first kiss and we will all be seniors next year. I have been dating this wonderful guy for 15 months, we meant when we were freshman. We both liked each other secretly for a year, and we were really good friends. Then one day he randomly decided to break up with his current girlfriend and decided to ask me out in our history class when we were sophomores. Long story short, I wasn't expecting this relationship to even start, or last. I always thought, oh were too good of friends to have a romantic relationship, but I was completely wrong. <br>  I think your true love will come to you. Just be patient. It'll be worth it :)|`|b9cVOwv0aa	if the right person will come alone is true then shouldn't every1 be happy and be married already? there is no such thing as the right person. the right person is whoever u want it to be. you''ll just have to go meet people. don't approach them with an intention of making them your gf. be friends and then when the time comes you'll know in yourself that you want that person.|`|2OoyYsA2aa	you dont neccasarily need to wait for the most perfect person ever, they may come, and you may never meet them. if you see a girl you like talk to her, you have to do some work. you cant just expect it to come to you<br>  although ive been blessed with actually finding my true love!<br>  all the best to you dont worry youll be fineeee|`|xs5J6VJTaa	I think that you are doing what every single teenager does.

I think sometimes people are lucky and they have, but a lot of the time they go with lust and infatuation. I don't think it's always love. <br>  I know what you mean about being lonely, but I think that when you're feeling that alone and unfulfilled it's because you need people. You need human contact and friendship. Love will come, but feeling whole on your own is a good first step.<br>  I do think that some are lucky enough to meet and be with their true love or soul mate. <br>  People say love comes when you either least expect of you're ready. I believe that the first part of that is true and to some extent the latter. Love seems to have a way of sneaking up on a person. I think the second part of that is half true. It would seem like it happens when you're ready, but I think somewhere deep inside yourself you decide you're ready and without realizing it, start looking around. <br>  I believe that you can actively look for someone and make someone your true love, but I don't know if that's the real stuff. Be patient and maybe you'll find that person you've been wanting. In the meantime it would help if you didn't focus completely on this search. Find other reasons to be happy and fulfilled. Deepen your current and future relationships. Work on the people in your life and make new friends. Find solace and a measure of happiness in them. You'll feel better. And make goals.|`|3p6fXiFpaa	True love will come to you when it's time, but all the same you cannot just sit around and do nothing (meaning that you need to get out there and let yourself be known. Your true love isn't going to find you if you hide out) It's going to take time, effort, kindness, and many other things. There's much more to it then it just showing up. <br>  <br>  Most women are afraid to approach someone that they like, let alone ask them out so your best bet is to ask them out yourself. Getting to know the person first helps as well. <br>  The first person you date is most likely not going to be the person that you spend the rest of your life with, so if it doesn't work out don't fret! It might be a rough start, but if it means that much to you then don't give up.|`|HkviOlBgaa	It is true. And it is because you are looking for them. My explanation: if you are looking for a girlfriend, it shows signs of desperation and lack of confidence, it is a definate mood killer if that is the only thing that is stopping you from finding "the one". The reason many people say to just let it happen is just not to worry. If you don't have it on your mind, you won't have that "desperate" aura hanging around you all of the time. However, if you are confident, girls will see you as a pleasant person to be with, someone with who to share those feelings. Just let it happen, you can't force these kinds of things anyways.|`|3EcHYvtUaa	First, this is your best answer:   Yes, it will come to you , don't be worried.  Dating is about finding out what you want  and dont want, what you like and dont like in the other person.  Dating gives us the expeereince of tiral and error, to learn from our mistakes, to find out what we are good at and not good at in a realtionship.  Like if you have a hard time communicating, talking about your feelings, saying whats on your mind, etc.  you need to work on these skills to be succesful in a relationship.  However there is no time table even though we are falsely lead to believe there is.  Life has different paths for all of us.  Go to collage, get a job, do what ever like has next for you.  Eventually you will find that when the time is right dating will start having a place in your life.  In the mean time, know that most girls, like men who have a persoanlity, are smart, can make them laugh, know how to listen, know how to set their priorities, and have ambition.  work on those while your waiting....|`|hjoenDgLaa	you wont spend you whole life alone..see the thing is your looking,,and wanting a girlfriend,,i mean who wouldnt want sumone,,but when you look for someone most of the time you get what you don;t want,,and if you jus sit back and let it happen then you will get what you want,,let love come to you and you wont be dissiponted,,and jus live your life right now go out with your friends have fun,,and dont try and think about love coming to you it will come when you least expect it.|`|1OQKJ2jraa	you are young, enjoy it while you can.

nyHnYT4uaa	Yes he is definately interested in you, I saw the exact cheesy stuff when I like a girl. Sometimes guys are shy and don't want to be the first to call (like me) because they don't think the girl is interested. Thats why he said the stuff that he did to see if you would respond to it positively (calling him, flirting with him) or negatively (ignoring), its a classic way of not getting rejected but saying you like her.|`|IiJH6wF5aa	I'm a guy, and i've acted almost exactly the same to girls i like.  He likes you.

It all depends... your young, enjoy your four years of high school!!! :)|`|xsLnqDinaa	first off...middle school and high school...key words for [its not gonna last!]<br>  there's my advice..i guess
kGBli717aa	First, of course, be sure that the child is yours. Get a test if there is any doubt. <br>  If it is indeed your child, give the mother/ you ex some space if she wants it. Wait until after the baby is born, things change sometimes after the fact. She may develop feelings for you after the birth. Try to keep all options open. <br>  If after your child is born, things do not work out, try for full custody. If you see her as an unfit parent, document that for the courts. <br>  If all else fails, try to bribe her. Sometimes those experiencing tough times will take a bit of money; even if it means giving up custody. See if your parents could help with that. <br>  Yes, you do not want to only visit your child. What if she finds some other guy to live with or marry? Then he will have more influence over your child than you. And, yes, pedophiles do target those women that are divorced and with children. <br>  See the military for any available law aid that they may have. <br>  You will be a great father having your child's interests as a priority so early. Be tough, go for it and do the right thing.
37M3dkkRaa	You can live without him, remember you've done it before. it's hard, yeah i know it is, but sometimes people just lose the spark they once had for each other or they lose interest in other words. sometimes PEOPLE *not only guys* don't consider the feelings of other people before they take action on anything, especially something like cheating. it's usually just something that happens, it's not planned. it does take time to get over it, a lot of time in fact, but once you learn that you're worth more than this guy who can't respect you, you'll be doing alot better with or without him. if he's not willing to even talk to you about things and try to work it out, he really doesn't care about the relationship like you do. i feel bad for you because he wasn't thinking about your feelings at all.<br>  <br>  good luck. if you need someone to talk to you can email me, my email is on my profile.|`|JBECY23daa	well im kinda in your shoes but with out the cheating part but if your in love with him like you say don't move on right away i don`t care what the reason is because in the end it will bite you in the ***.because you hurt your self and the guy you said you loved just because of someone in your family so be careful and the pain will go away slowly.
aXOyK3uBaa	Don't worry about it.<br>  <br>  You're not required to be attracted to someone. And you can say "I'm just not attracted to you anymore" to a girl's face. She will understand, and it's impossible to argue.... but more importantly its the TRUTH.<br>  <br>  Anything else is just BS<br>  ? "Its not you its me"<br>  ? "We're both in different places right now"<br>  ? "I just don't feel like have anything to give at the moment"<br>  ? "I feel like I really need to concentrate on my career".<br>  ? "i really like you as a friend".<br>  <br>  Pathetic lies.<br>  All of them.<br>  <br>  "Im just not attracted to you anymore" is all you have to say. You don't have to tell her any kinds of other things. Or make other excuses.<br>  <br>  Let's face it... when it comes to relationships , women are pretty SELFISH and GREEDY. The expect all kinds of adoration and attention and Valentine's Day bullshit... but what do they offer the guys???<br>  <br>  Don't worry about it.|`|7q5HsXALaa	If the chemistry is not there anymore end it, only problems will arise in the future.

9c16f104f9589fa27971d779def0ac39aa	Because some guys are stupid like that, honestly.  I'm sorry you had to go through that, I think we all experience that once in our lives, being strung along.  Anyway, either he really is still hooked on his ex, or all he wanted was the physical part of a relationship but started to feel guilty or got cold feet.  Don't look at it as a personal rejection.. it's just one of those big eye roll moments.<br>  I would just try to use it as a good lesson and the next time you're interested in a guy, just be wary he could be a total flake :)|`|O5KOwhovaa	Because he was trying to sleep with you.<br>  <br>  Once it became obvious he wasn't going to get any, he left.|`|kS7JqjPzaa	Go for asian.|`|vWsP9uznaa	sorry that this may sound harsh, but it seems like he used u:( forget about that jerk, and move on!|`|XwyUATsKaa	He didn't realize he would feel that way until he got intimate with you.  Unfortunately, having a bub on the way will complicate things for the two of you.  If he doesn't have kids, or the ex doesn't have kids, that means that he's not ready to take on that emotional responsibility.|`|ktEfBhszaa	Not everyone knows exactly how they feel at all times. There's a different level of processing going on in times of physical attraction and at times of reflection. He might have just taken time to think about where he wants to take his life and came to that conclusion. You don't go into every situation knowing how you're going to feel about it. Just because he feels that way now doesn't mean he went in that way.|`|gX3MeosXaa	Sometimes it's hard to get over exes & you don't want to admit it. You think when you start dating somebody your able to but that's not always the case. I'm sorry that it has happened to you. I've been on his side of the fence before. Just give him time you never know what it could bring.|`|27fe1e3ae697035fd2660cec751b7997aa	becasue guys are like that... they will always be like that. girls arent any better but thats a guys theme. they juss do that. ya it sucks but it will be alright., you should ask him, y he just didnt tell u that from the beginning... he will probably just say that he didnt want to hurt u. typical guy answer. just hang in there, the right guy will come, dont worry. =)<br>  <br>  Answer mine???<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Aql6lSFDLfQ3JTZTUckbhojsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090306153258AAJkDuo">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|N5SQxiXEaa	I can picture how you feel but most likely he didn't realize all that in detail until after and got a little freaked out by reality but its better him telling you period than sticking around feeling uncomfortable and leading you on.|`|xV672tJcaa	He didn't know it until he pondered it over.|`|r4E2zXL8aa	why are you messing around with random guys while you're pregnant?????|`|QbAK7J74aa	it sounds like because he still liked his ex.

QGQORd6uaa	Communication is the key really. Most times in movies all you see is the couple having sex and moaning - but really you need to talk to your partner let them know what feels good what hurts- slow - fast- etc... don't be embarrassed or shy - you'll prob want to take it pretty slow. Lots of foreplay, and it's better to be relaxed. My first time didn't hurt, but every body is different so you never know. <br>  <br>  You've made a big decision, so if it doesn't feel right physically or emotionally, just remember you can always say "mmmmmmmmmmmm.yeah not ready thought i was buut I'm not" Trust me you'll have plenty of time - but hey at least you've thought it out. <br>  <br>  Have fun - be safe - and geez use a condom - So what if you're both "virgins" and maybe you're on birth control - you never know and better safe than sorry.|`|IOqM3fHtaa	Honestly everyones different and i know alot of people who say there first time didnt hurt at all. i know for me we used alittle lube so things would slide better and not be as painful. but the fingering thing can also be a good idea.

a74b14a2df8f491b94ca062ec6bd8e23aa	I see no problem helping both ways (I, the daughter, have been the lender to my parents quite a few times). BUT, it might depend on why your parents need the money. Is it to bail someone else out, or to feed a habit or addiction that's overtaken their finances, or is it for something that goes against your husband's morals? If so that might be why he doesn't want to help them out. I see no reason why children can't financially help out their parents/in-laws. <br>  <br>  You might want to ask him though if maybe there is a reason he doesn't want to depart with the money, such as if it would hurt your family too much financially to help them (such as deplete your family's savings, which could cause financial hardship on you guys as well).|`|EMKuBql8aa	So simply said: Your dad has helped you guys both in the past and now when he needs help your husband doesn't want to help??<br>  <br>  It's family, of course he should help and needs to set aside petty differences and help. Your husband is not only acting selfish but small.|`|xnmNfC49aa	Well I think that if your father has helped out you guys in the past, then it would be selfish of your husband to not return the favor.  His obligation is to you, and if this is something that you want to do, then he should take your past help and your feelings into consideration.  When you got married your family became his family.  Families are supposed to help one another.....your father has helped him out, so I think he should def be more open to the idea of helping your father out in his time of need.|`|Ui2uAkD8aa	This is something my wife and  I went through. We were both making good money, but I'm very conservative with money. My mom spends like crazy, but lost her job lost year and didn't adjust her spending. She got in a tight spot and we helped her, but then we realized that we were just throwing money away. <br>  <br>  I would say that if it is a one time thing AND you can afford it, then you should help your family. Your hubby needs to man up. If your parents will be a money pit, then you have to say "we understand what you're going through, but we just can't afford it"...also, if you really can't afford it....don't borrow or do something stupid to help them. You and your husband and kids (?) come first before you give money to anyone. <br>  <br>  Also, please don't go behind his back and help them. You are cheating on your husband if you do that and it can kill you marriage. <br>  <br>  Bottom Line: Help if you can and it's a good investment, but don't feel like you owe them.|`|Sj9Q4bt4aa	I believe that you should help anyone if you are capable, especially your family. I know that this might cause strife for you. I am sure if you help your father your husband will be mad and vice versa. Just pray about it and do the best you can. God will help you.|`|nxMi4adjaa	it all depends on the relationship between said son-in-law and your father. if your husband respects you he will consider it your money and give your dad a loan<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090309194014AAm0bM2">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>

AA10408380	It depends on our connection and how deep our relation was. My ex dumped me after putting me through hell. And now I just have to hope that one day he'll get his in the end. But if had one more day with him....well....he wouldn't be a male anymore. Lorena Bobit cut off the wrong part!
5n1SkKl5aa	Suffocated, not to mention a little creeped out...|`|bNRUjnGZaa	She wouldn't be my significant other if she did that. We all need to spend time with people of our own sex sometimes - to watch a ball game or in a woman's case to go shopping.|`|B8Nz2KzXaa	not so good,<br>  <br>  because<br>  <br>  Your Significant Other is missing the point...<br>  <br>  You always need friends around you...<br>  <br>  -R|`|EsaFg8eaaa	My husband tells me that, I ask then how come you have friends and I dont? How is that fair? It usually shuts him up..<br>  <br>  It makes me feel like I am being controlled.|`|oDL02s8kaa	segregated!|`|QevBVANtaa	very happy/ loved =]   That he/her would want to spend all his/her time with me and that they think i don't need any friends because they are always there for me.|`|Kg681jL8aa	lost in a world that shuts you out (don't forget us if you go my sis)|`|6U4sl15uaa	this is so not true you need friends to deal with being mad at him and I would say he is trying to be controlling so be very careful if he tries any thing unlawful I would say get out of that relationship as quickly as possible|`|uXOhQidGaa	Like I need to dump this clingy ***** immediately.
p7uqoya2aa	I always feel this way. I do EVERYTHING and not so much as a thanks babe from him. I tried to cut back on what I do such as cleaning the house, laundry, bills, but all that happened was I got a very dirty house and late bills and still no help. So I was left pissed off and still doing everything. I am at the point now where divorce is my only option. I hate to think it has come to this, but men never change. Good luck to you.|`|hn4ro8tKaa	You can try taking care of your needs for awhile, and let him take care of his own stuff. Another option would be to just take care of everything generally, but only focus in on what you need (this leave his stuff in the middle ground). If everything else fails there's always marriage counselors That are willing to help you as a couple. <br>  **** I AM IN THE PLAYPEN WITH MILDRED ****|`|wFVsoAGGaa	A man needs respect.  A woman needs love.<br>  <br>  As a woman, show your husband respect.  Without condition.  Not what you would define as respect, but what he would see as respect.  Just as a husband is to love his wife without condition and die for her and sacrifice for her, so a wife is to submit to her husband and respect him, unconditionally.  No husband is deserving of respect, neither is there any wife that is deserving of love, yet husbands are to still love their wives, and wives are to respect their husbands.<br>  <br>  As a husband I am to love my wife no matter what, even when she does not show me respect.  So I say to you, respect your husband even when he doesn't show you love.  It is for Christ we do these things, not one another.|`|afc450c272a8e7cbe986f3278a12edf0aa	I completely understand your pain! I feell the same way. i work a full tiem job and go to school part time. i clean and cook and still he thinks he does enough. It is crazy! I know he works hard to but cant you take 5 minutes to talk to me during lunch so i can tell you about why im havign a bad day. that would be enough to make me happy. i do everything for him but sometimes it is liek talking to a wall.|`|t0rOQ5FWaa	I feel that way about my wife i work all day then have to come home and cook and clean while she sits on her big lazy butt ( it's a pretty butt tho) on yahoo answers<br>  <br>  Btw we have no kids<br>  <br>  I gave you a star because i love your questions and answers<br>  <br>  With her i only hope i don't live to be 80
pOmjcVjZaa	It's not illegal, nor is it weird. What's illegal is for him to have sex with her while she's under 18, even if she's okay with it. But other than that, the relationship would be perfectly fine.|`|ulUBv22eaa	it is illegal|`|eQENZXz1aa	Depending on where they live some states 16 is legal|`|82f7229d874223ffc501636d6a689c93aa	forget what others think, it doesnt really matter unless sex is involved. but, my gf is 14 and im 16 i dont really care if people "look" at me weird.
QM2cQ9Ogaa	erm.....he is not gay is he?<br>  <br>  Have you tried masturbating him, did his penis get an erection? If yes, at least he is not impotent|`|qdsVS1dDaa	Jenny, I think that you need to have an additional talk with your bf and get a further explanation on "I'm just not into sex."  EXACTLY what does this  mean to him. You might want to re-evaluate your position with him.<br>  <br>  Regards,<br>  Dan
RSaa5jTTaa	i think its absolutely beautiful that you are waiting for a very serious relatiosnhip or possibly marriage. I think it is sweet and would not affect how i potray you. woman may be a little intimidated. they may first think why you hadent in the first place. they may wonder if there is something more to you than meets the eye when really youre just a nice guy. Also, they may not want to be your special one if the have done it. they may assume you are also looking for someone who is waiting until a really serious relationship. it would be interesting to know.. would you date a non-virgin|`|rSXZOU5zaa	Not at all!|`|8oX0wZAIaa	No, on the contrary it's actually a good thing because it shows you have self-restraint! That is a big turn-on for a lot of girls, btw.<br>  <br>  Don't compromise your morals. There's not many ppl like you left :)|`|nCRUnCJxaa	hey if hes a virgin and i am a virgin... i dont see a problem in that :] although id kinda want someone who may be experienced so he can teach me things. but either ones cool. :] i want to save mines for the right one. not until marriage, but whatever comes at me. hope this helps!
wnb0EgaHaa	It may not have been a lie at the time for him or for you, but the reality of now and your future is what you have to face.<br>  <br>  Hopefully, it will help to understand that while he is using, he is not capable of making rational decisions.  No matter how great he was, or what wonderful characteristics he has or had, drug addiction is a destructive, heartbreaking thing to have to manage.<br>  <br>  If he is not capable of managing himself, and clearly that is the case, you seem to understand on an intellectual level that he is not capable of managing a relationship.  However, knowing that does not lessen the pain of disappointment or betrayal.<br>  <br>  I would encourage you to try to view the relationship that you had with him from a different perspective.  Try to look at what you learned from it, and what you gained from your time with him.  If you can take the good, and understand that the rest was beyond your control and probably his as well, it will make moving forward an easier process.<br>  <br>  People who become addicts usually become addicts because they are trying to escape or manage issues within themselves.  They don't have the necessary coping skills, so it's not actually a conscious decision to throw life away.  It's usually an attempt to escape or manage emotional pain, but of course, it's a temporary high that, in time, takes them further down a road of destruction.<br>  <br>  Instead of viewing it as time wasted, try to view it as time invested in learning something about yourself and life.  <br>  <br>  My advise would be to work through the emotions, then move on and make your life what you want it to be.  Count yourself lucky that you were not married and did not have children before this happened.<br>  <br>  I went through something similar after 10 years of marriage with a small child.  (I won't go into all the details here, but if you're interested, I have in some of my prior answers.) It is not something I would wish on my worst enemy.  The fact that he hid it from you is not surprising...addicts are very clever when it comes to covering their tracks until the addiction is spiraling out of control.  <br>  <br>  Best wishes to you in getting past this.  It's not easy, but you will be stronger once you've worked your way through all the emotions.|`|cGbTJobeaa	Question:  Why does he choose this lifestyle? <br>  Answer:  Because that's what drugs do to people. They make drugs more appealing than their spouses, children, continued employment, etc.<br>  <br>  That's why it is called dope!<br>  <br>  BTW, next time do a better job choosing your boyfriends.  If you see a red flag, don't ignore it simply because you looooove him or the sex is good.|`|iblT1HJpaa	Okay - you really don't get it. <br>  You are the true codependent for in all of it  -  you still love him. Love has nothing to do with this. You're all messed up with hormones or something. <br>  Get your butt into Celebrate Recovery and see where you have as much problem as him. If you don't go - whatever...............|`|jAGwyyuyaa	He will not get of the drugs until he's wants to. And sometimes, that never happens.|`|nk9m9PmUaa	Not everyone places same value on people, relationships, life. Nothing personal, just lifes not fair. Dry your eyes and move on- regardless of the hurt. He's not worth your tears. Good luck.|`|OBbuiqZ3aa	Only he can answer this question. But i do know this, He doesn't know what he has until it is gone.|`|13d4bd226d0dce7fe19e7693dc8cfed9aa	like most dopers and boozers, they are losers, but then again thats what most women want in thier lives,,|`|djUMvICoaa	Alcoholics and drug users are usually looking for a means of escape, something from their past to hard to deal with or too many pressures of todays life that they are looking to hide from.  It always works good for a while but you still come down to the same place you tried to escape.  Having talked with someone who was once hooked on drugs she said that the rush you get when you first take a hit is incredible, and it should be your heart races your blood pressure escalates and you get as close to killing yourself as you can while looking for something to make you feel good.|`|qNMfaJ4Raa	He didn't choose to be addicted. He has an illness and needs to be rehabilitated. If you're a strong woman you'll stick by him and help him through his recovery. I don't blame you if you choose to leave him.. drug addiction is so terrible and everyone in the users life is affected in terrible ways. It's really trying.|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	There's a red neon EXIT sign over this door--take it.

lNlL0Ag2aa	It doesn't matter, he apparently likes you, but nothing seems to progress in this affair. He's restraining to approach you and you're waiting to be approached so that basically mutually ends any start of a relationship.
8M4WZ8x5aa	in my opinion, i dont think you should do it. Like you said, it'll really hurt her. If you want her back, this is not the way to do it. <br>  <br>  Try something else like idk, Talking!!! tell her that you miss her. Tell her that even though its hard for you to "beg" her to come back because you dont want to be like a "pathetic" loser, you are still doing it because you really care about her. <br>  <br>  Good Luck!! :)|`|f03edf3d3fe5d3e7c31416dd3871939aaa	do not bother doing that|`|pzfTCjqyaa	NOOOOOOO! DON'T do that!  That is the LAST thing you want to do!!!  First you will make your gf feel terrible and when she finds out you were just trying to make her jealous (and trust me, she WILL find out) she will be so angry at you that she'll never want you back.  You just need to talk to her and tell her how you feel.  Trust me, girls love it and once she sees how much you want her back, she might take you back.  I'm not making any guarantees, but if you talk to her there's a much better chance she'll take you back then if you try to make her jealous.|`|uLHtXibRaa	Yerh making her jealous will really make her listen to you and realize how much you value her thoughts and feelings!!...Look jelaousy gets no good results..and if i had that situation i really would have no time for a man who wanted to play childs games..women want an equal not another mother role to take on board...|`|Ry5sFO7iaa	no if you want her back don't do that i would get this hot girl right and then you two go in front of your GF or ex and just bang the hot girl right in front of her.|`|mDBHMJPjaa	naah, i think you should tell her how you feel after a couple of days and she will realize how much she missed you, or how much she didn't miss you..<br>  help me plzz..<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AkJOB1u81_FW4.KIirLeBbnsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090309200602AAtOKmv">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|p9r6sKx2aa	Horrible idea...that wont make her want to back you idiot! dont do it|`|ZH9OIfUXaa	no no no! personally i say don't do it! be a man step up and tell her how you feel express emotions girls love that trust me! my boyfriend sounds like you and when he gets in the mood and tells me how he fees i just wan to cry my eyes out!|`|0q0bVJYaaa	No, you dumbass.

That simple.|`|mpgpImZyaa	Eh thats not a very good idea...<br>  That wont make her want to come back.<br>  Just get over your ego and explain to her why you want her back.<br>  You dont have to be mushy about it just be honest.

In our country we don't use the caste system and you should not judge yourself by it either, and what the heck is NRI anyway? Be a woman with rights, not some sex slave to some dumba** from a county that treats women shallowly. Always remember your a human being, not a sperm bank.|`|P9ZOMoagaa	Move back to the US.

Just tell them you are not an item or thing that can be used for their pleasure. Just be rude to these guys, and dear all guys are not of one type. Some are like they dont treat womens properly and some are really good. You firstly have to leave these guys companion. You have to find good guys.

EwmHsEoiaa	It sounds like he has phimosis (a tight foreskin).  This is probably why it has restricted his growth.<br>  Take a look here for normal retraction of the foreskin:<br>  <a href="http://geocities.com/painfulquestioning/naturalresources" rel="nofollow">http://geocities.com/painfulquestioning/...</a><br>  <br>  The foreskin is attached to the glans at birth.  It usually becomes retractable.  the average age is 10.<br>  <br>  Phimosis is usually caused by putting too much pressure on the penis in masturbation.  It damages the soft spongy arteries of the penis.  So they do not fill up with blood as well.  Conseqently on erection the skin isn't stretched by the glans (head of penis) pushing through.<br>  <br>  So in order to cure his phimosis, he needs to rest it.  then tell him to masturbate without pressure.  Just lightly grip the foreskin and move it up and down.  Don't rub it.<br>  <br>  It is a lot better if the man has a foreskin.  Only 25% of the world are circumcised - 2/3 of these are Muslim.<br>  <br>  The foreskin has a function.  It contains many specialized nerves on it's underside.  When the foreskin is moved up and down it is very pleasurable.  Circumcised men have lost this ability to masturbate easily as there is no gliding effect.  Circumcised men often have to resort to artificial lubrication in masturbation and sex.  See here for the function of the foreskin:<br>  <a href="http://geocities.com/painfulquestioning/naturalresources" rel="nofollow">http://geocities.com/painfulquestioning/...</a><br>  <br>  Without the foreskin protecting the glans, circumcised men lose further sensitivity.  The glans (head of the penis) dries out.  It also brushes on underwear causing the skin to toughen.  See here for the full damage done:<br>  <a href="http://www.noharmm.org/IDcirc.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.noharmm.org/IDcirc.htm</a><br>  <br>  There are good reasons to believe that sex is better for the woman as well, if the man has his foreskin intact:<br>  <a href="http://www.sexasnatureintendedit.com/10F/doctor_northrup.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.sexasnatureintendedit.com/10F...</a>|`|xJ2kcJsraa	it is a deal breaker.<br>  <br>  doesn't even fold when he's hard?<br>  <br>  jesus.<br>  <br>  i don't have any solutions....because that kinda sucks.<br>  <br>  tbh, i'm not circumcised either, but my weiner doesn't do that.<br>  <br>  edit: also...i think size has smoething to do with it.<br>  <br>  anything over 3 inches and he shouldn't have that.|`|7zbAfWTTaa	LMAO.

Ask your brother or the person giving the shower where they are registered.|`|O36qjj7Oaa	Lingerie|`|sFNNDqhGaa	There are lots of ways to look at it. <br>  <br>  For her, for the honeymoon, for a room in the house, but before you buy find out if there is a theme. <br>  <br>  I found this site that offers ideas to help you come up with a gift. Some are honeymoon related and others are cute and they range from Wedding time capsule to name change kit to couples glassware. <br>  <br>  Cute and fun.<br>  <a href="http://giftideacenter.com/Occasion/Bridal_Shower/gifts.php" rel="nofollow">http://giftideacenter.com/Occasion/Brida...</a><br>  <br>  Sarah|`|T3BXC8qXaa	If she's going on a honeymoon, maybe some new luggage...<br>  <br>  A day at the spa before the wedding...<br>  <br>  Something that's personal and just for her. Something to help her relax or look beautiful on her wedding day!<br>  <br>  If you're really stumped, ask your brother what she enjoys...:)|`|lyhnHhuWaa	Ask if she's registered anywhere.  If she is, you can purchase something from her registry and know you're getting something she wants.|`|rI7J9M8taa	A gift card to her favorite store.
2JUQYLCGaa	Cute non popular guy kind of sounds more sexy and mysterious. Lol.<br>  <br>  Kind of like the strong silent loner that walks around looking hott but doesn't have a ton of friends and never makes an appearance at parties?<br>  <br>  Yeah, that's a popular boy image in teenage movies.<br>  Like the Faculty and Disturbing Behavior and You Drive Me Crazy and the list goes on.<br>  <br>  The hot popular jerk just sounds like a douchebag. There were a couple of those in my highschool and trust me, regardless of their popularity they still never got girls. ;] Ever.<br>  <br>  And in the movies, the hot popular jerk always get's left for the cute non popular guy. LMFAO.<br>  Like in John Tucker Must Die. ;]|`|cemoxH23aa	Well right now im with a jerk popular guy ,<br>  if those fricken cut un-popular guys would talk to<br>  me i would WAY rather go out with one of em !|`|cETHipfBaa	definitly the cute non popular guy!!|`|iOv9tbULaa	Cute non popular...You could always make him cool by dating him.|`|aBx67aHRaa	A cute non popular guy because I had my experience with a jerk. They are no fun. Plus who cares about the popularity really.|`|RsDAGnBhaa	cute non popular guy :) a hot jerk sounds like too much drama haha|`|40xf6ISpaa	i would much rather date a cute unpopular chick than a popular *****
L4oH4SOCaa	Hey you answered my question. lol. OMG I LOVE THIS POEM IT IS SOOOOOO SWEET!! I THINK THAT IS SO SWEET OF YOU! I DON'T EVEN KNOW YOU AND I AM HAVING TEARS OF HAPPINESS RIGHT NOW! IF YOU WERE MY BF I WOULD LOVE IT TO DEATH<br>  ! <br>  hope  i helped lol. bye!|`|aEDB2IvIaa	i think its cute shell love it...|`|8fyEZtyNaa	it sounds pretty childish and sappy honestly.<br>  <br>  i dont like rhymes. it was wayyy too happy and too short.|`|N7gOE1btaa	You are probably too old for the rhyming couplets--they tend to make things lose meaning and are childish.  Try a sonnet.  They are challenging but can be great.
DEfBcpGcaa	To me a confident girl that has a nice smile is irresistable.  As long as she has these two things as well as a good sense of humor, it doesn't matter what kind of hair, clothing, or makeup they have. don't worry a great guy will come around soon enough and realize how lucky he is to have found u. hope this helps :)|`|IyvUC47Paa	personality for me.<br>  if the girls got humor, i'd be interested in talking to her and see how it goes later on.|`|uEIOgxWlaa	The best girlfriend for me would be a caring sweet genuine down to earth women. One that really loved me for not just my appearance but the type of person I am. A woman who would respect me and help me out with needs. I also like to help. Clothing doesn't matter to me that much. Whatever they are comfortable in suits me. With that being said a woman with a caring heart is what I'm pretty much asking for. There more rare to find these days. But they are out there! Actually there is a lot but I want one to love me for me. You seem like the type of girl any guy would want to be with. I can't speak highly enough about how important women are to me in my life.
VjmTK6uZaa	No, only some guys do this.  You just haven't met your Romeo that will sweep you off your feet and make you his Juliet.  Simple as that.  Their are plenty of guys that will show respect for a girl and truly love her and be their no matter what.  It all takes time though.  Usually we don't meet those kind of people at highschool or middle school, but usually we dont meet them either until college or even jobs after college.  You will just have to wait and play the field soem more.  Just don't give out your heart easy, put up a good fence around it so it is not broken.|`|339b4238208a222953efaf761bcadf81aa	Shay, Shay, I have no respect for a girl who puts out,  I figure I have to earn that favor, and earning takes time.  Yes, I really value modesty, and I take it you do too.  I think you're female, so more power to you.  Jack|`|4b0af5311f2d55ba03672ac9a75178b8aa	personally, If a girl is putting out like theres no tomorrow, I don't know what diseases she has and I would rather be with someone I can stand to be around. Hard to believe I'm in High school.|`|qNMfaJ4Raa	I'm not a guy. But men and women alike, all of the human race, we all are attracted to CONFIDENCE. If confidence comes in the package of being "sluttyy" or a girl that will put out for anyone, then so be it.
LtP7oOtraa	it's good pain for some girls...like it starts out as pain, but spreads as pleasure, i find that most guys don't have enjoyable pain so this can be a difficult concept. she honestly wants to be spanked and have her hair pulled..hard...but not to the point that hair is coming out or she can't sit the next day....for most girls...it's also a dominance thing...like let's her know her man's in charge...turn on...sometimes it's nice to be submissive.|`|9BEnnPhOaa	they like you or they want attention.|`|KHtrHhKFaa	wtf|`|2wZhVA8faa	Hahaha. It all depends on the girl and what turns her on... :P If she wants it... give it to her! :D|`|xN5QDXMmaa	If a girl says that shes pulling your leg. Besides would you do that anyway.
At8D5Xu2aa	If his situation hasn't changed, I'd keep it at a friendship level.  Until he works out his issues, he's not a keeper, hun.  Sorry to say.|`|zdQGden1aa	"I thought we had a great time - but can't understand why he contacted me again, his financial situation wasn't any better?"<br>  <br>  He thought that in due time his financial situation would get better and perhaps he'd have more to offer. When he saw that breaking up with you to get things in order didn't work he knew that he'd lost something genuine and wanted those old feelings back. The way I see it, he was damned if he did or didn't. That's what he's probably realizing.|`|naequcqlaa	I would say he needed a good boost to his moral & a good time w/someone he knew could provide it.  He just may not want to involve you in his life at the moment w/all his many sad problems & is just afraid to get "too close" & doesn't want to allow this to happen.  You no doubt w/hear from him in the future again, but don't get your hopes up too high, he does have a LOT of serious problems.  I just feel you were someone he needed at the moment & tho't about you.  Good luck to you...:)|`|8570479ada3440ab391f420fea968801aa	3 words  don't be stupid|`|1hDhmql4aa	This one is a hard one!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  Maybe he came back to make sure you were not the one.  Maybe his story about the money issues never were!<br>  Maybe he does like you but his pride is stronger and he doesn't like himself poor?<br>  <br>  That's the best I could do but it sounds to confusing and if it is because of money and if you got together, you wouldn't want him nicking off every time there was an issue so I'd say move on!|`|zu10q3Qyaa	Sounds like he's kind of selfish to me.  He is into you as long as he can use you when he wants to.  There is no commitment he lives for himself.  Better decide weather you deserve better and if I were you I'd tell him that you are so much more valuable than he treats you.|`|0EB2ZR0Gaa	I'd chalk it up to "he felt like it".  This guy doesn't think you're a "keeper".  If you have a serious love relationship,  would YOU give that up because of any financial circumstances?  Well apparently he thinks that makes sense.  You need to just accept that what you see is what you get.  He can be pleasant and charming and fun company, but he has no interest in sticking with you through thick and thin.  He's all surface and no substance.  I have a sneaking suspicion that you are better off not knowing him any better than you do.<br>  <br>  Go ahead and have dinner with him once a month just for fun.  But for heaven's sake don't take it any further than that.  And only do the dinner part if he can afford to pay for it!|`|0a6f37ff97b71253871297bc4face75aaa	Possibly for inspiration, and possibly to compare. It's hard to say. He probably has some serious thinking to do and a choice to make.|`|2AhcNaBzaa	sometimes people just get to thinking about their exes and want to see what they've been up to
lTsONvwQaa	He missed you and it sounds like your the only positive thing in his life right now. he needed cheering up.|`|63tch8D5aa	he probaly just wanted to see how you were,<br>  wanted closure and wanted to see you again,<br>  if he hasnt called than he probaly wont,<br>  but why dont you just call him.|`|bvnSjdmeaa	maybe he was interested in spending time with someone..perhaps he is just looking for a friend through the hard time which everyone is going through|`|IyvUC47Paa	this sounds a little fishy.<br>  maybe he was seeing somebody else while you guys were separated and didnt go well and decided to come back to you....<br>  <br>  or it could be the total opposite, am no dr phil|`|U2dd5QExaa	o i am sorry i dont know what to tell u hun|`|bWpYLSKSaa	He might be desperately looking to find someone for his life, someone that will make it seem a lot less empty. If he keeps on leaving and coming back, I wouldn't really want to see him. It seems as if he isn't that into you, but just wants to come back and go away whenever he wants to, as if he can just do whatever he wants. Talk to him and ask what has changed, and if he doesn't seem truthful, I wouldn't stay with him.|`|osuheMcoaa	Bootycall??<br>  <br>  Or<br>  <br>  He may ahve just accepted the situation the economy put him in as opposed to before when he was having a hard time with it all. He may be the kind of guy who takes out anger and frustration on the people who are closest to him. So maybe he was saving you from that.<br>  <br>  But if he dissapeared again... yeah bootycall.|`|8M4WZ8x5aa	Ughh! men are so confusing. Lol. <br>   We can only guess whats going on in their heads. <br>  <br>  Maybe he came back because he realized that he missed you and that he missed having ur companionship. <br>  <br>  Best thing you can do is talk to him about this, I mean, why is he confusing you llike this? Why cant he be straight foward of what he wants? <br>  <br>  Good lucK!|`|va8quhPtaa	Memory made him come back.May back again to open it !
pVaZty4Maa	be honest i think u look great, maybe you just need to start flirting more with the girls :)|`|bMmV6R2Jaa	Ok, make some changes. .and the thing is . its about confidence as much as appearance. You question yourself.. so that should tell you  make a change. Go to a local good hair salon, ask for a hair cut and makeover. Theyre professionals and can guide you. You need to like yourself first or no one else will.  I didnt look at your  pic!|`|3ZpOTtHFaa	Uh... HELL to the YEAH!|`|vxhQWwaHaa	dude your hott.....<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  jk<br>  <br>  no i ...<br>  <br>  your really cute, idk wi ppl don't want to date you they must be stupid where you live<br>  <br>  <br>  your fine

Believe it or not its not normal to hate spending time with your significant other.  Being happy with someone else is a really great feeling, so long as you keep your friendships at the same time.. it can be hard to balance love and friendship but it can be done! And if your guy friends try to bust your balls and give you crap, blow it off.  It doesn't make you cooler to ditch your girl.. good luck with everything :D|`|GXhSvW2daa	i think your gf is lucky that your so nice to her im just idiot that cant show my gf how much i love her So for me thats a no i dont do Stuff like that maybe its because where from different places and we have different personalities but your a Cool guy Keep it up|`|qjcTgXcZaa	My boyfriend and I love to take walks and bike ride. We also are going to start going to the beach more. We barely ever hang out with friends, we just lay and talk or walk and stuff.|`|sFF98bKXaa	Aww<br>  you sound so sweet. <br>  Girls like to do that stuff to get to know each other better, without the distraction of other people and just being completely open together.<br>  It's good that you do that :)|`|gRXngD9aaa	Is she your girlfriend, or your sister.  Or are you gay?<br>  <br>  The only time you should be doing that type of stuff is when you're trying to convince her you're a nice guy, worth sleeping with.<br>  <br>  Man up, and spend more time having sex.|`|9ehfz3Gzaa	I think it sounds awesome. It might not be what every other couple does, but at the end of the day, it's about what each couple enjoys. If you guys are having fun spending time together then that's all that should matter!|`|fPpmgxjuaa	yea i spend a lot of time wit my g/f jus us two...i think its normal.she never asks me to do stuff like that i jus do it...but its cool|`|1d05c3224bb4bf99223539ad8f469647aa	Lol i do this all the time and my gf always ends up kissing me .<br>  =)|`|fxF2oraPaa	yeah, i like chicks that like to hang out (like a friend i can have sex with, lol)|`|dWp6KzM2aa	no but ima start sounds nice|`|E5Wd6ptxaa	sure.<br>  but i call it no pants time.|`|bdmRHIaZaa	Im a chick and no...

Do you have an older brother??? twin?|`|8VtqxobDaa	i do the same. it is nice you learn alot about each other and it helps the relationship.|`|u0S5N5wDaa	i wish more guys did that... very sweet... dont change it..shes a lucky girl...|`|AA12346188	Just enjoy the company.|`|QX28VLtKaa	Umm it's best to have free time, other wise you will just fight with each other all the time. It might not seem like that right now, but trust me it will.|`|BPNAcSpVaa	My boyfriend and I were like that in high school. 8 years and 4 kids later we have no friends. It is a good thing to build a relationship, but it is also healthy to have friends and interact with others.|`|TfbR1IFIaa	pretty normal if you ask me, i dont have a gf yet but my friend does and he just hangs around his gf all the time, all of us are cool with that.|`|a7f3d8bf66bfd9fc1daac1814d6e6577aa	sure .we love to do that too. just be together and talk walk,  hold hands walking on the beach, cuddle a little.|`|ZLt8TwOiaa	Your Girlfriend is a lucky gal.|`|zNdY7lxpaa	Ima girl...but i had to comment, that is awesome, my bf and i do things like that every once in awhile but,..thr is absolutely nothing wrong with that! :)|`|gn0LrrSRaa	My boyfriend and I always spend time just us two.

Everyone is different.|`|CzIaAnsraa	Most of us have been through 3 girls. Most of us have made out, had sex, etc., by then.
o4HFxYG5aa	During lunch,<br>  and the second outfit is sexy,<br>  it made me laugh a little lol.<br>  good luck.
7GLRYV8iaa	Aww your a sweety pie.We'd make good friends.It's very possible.Your just a friendly person but that's not always a good thing because there are some heartless people in this world that love to take advantage of people's kindness.Just be careful.|`|akIpddDSaa	Well, love can be expressed in so many different ways. We all know what the feeling is.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  ~LisaNova|`|ed8e2883b996a3685d6359a821a2d765aa	I love girls who love everyone.|`|iW80AcLgaa	sure why not, but i think you love everyone hypothetically, i am sure you don't love terrorists, or murderers, or someone who will steal your identity|`|K2Soawplaa	you can love everybody,<br>  but you cant be IN love with all of them|`|NrH787NZaa	NO, you are in LALA land|`|3KUH1DnLaa	looks like you took some ecstasy|`|jlzdQSmzaa	Yes! This just means that you are a good hearted person and that you were raised to love everyone in a healthy happy family. That's really wonderful just be careful that someone doesn't take advantage of your love and kindness, It can sometimes ruin a good soul like yours,Just know that there are good and bad out there in the real world. Take Care!|`|pcEJMHPMaa	you are not in love , you are in love with the idea of being in love.possibly a chemical in balance,due to low magnesium levels that require supplements,or a physiological disorder that possibly you lacked  as a child and are trying to regain 10-fold as an adult.seek some sort of consult.|`|8570479ada3440ab391f420fea968801aa	no u can only love one person at a time , it's no such thing as being in love with everybody. you can like everybody that u meet , but not in love .|`|AA12157096	i don't think so..<br>  <br>  see, just like Britney, she's great, and she has enemies too, I mean the people who dislikes her.|`|zxNEewYzaa	I guess you just love meeting new people, or people in general. I think your pretty lucky to love everyone! LUCKY|`|om3N441xaa	Infatuation is EASY....<br>  Love is HARD.......once burnt good you will learn the true difference..|`|oZ5QPymuaa	yeah. You are a good person and you just like people. a Philanthropist|`|At8D5Xu2aa	Well, let me email you my number....lmao|`|weDd8uuDaa	I think it is possible in a certain sense to feel a deep attachment to people just because theyre people; its something that I feel on alot of occasions. Love, in a way yes. In love...well I consider in love to be very different from simply love. In love means you want a romantic involvement, some kind of intimate (doesnt have to be sexual) relationship. But you can care alot about people in general without necessarily wanting to get involved with each and every one.  <br>  <br>  Love involves compassion. If you're able to have compassion for most of the people you come across and feel the human tie between you, then I think you understand alot more than most people. Empathy and compassion go a long way. There should be alot more of it around.|`|cOBk3NxQaa	Yes! Not romantically (in love) of course, but as for caring a lot for people and even trying your best to care for enemies is entirely possible. I'm like that, I love everyone, or try my best to. I don't really hate anyone and I even say hi and smile to people that get on my nerves sometimes.<br>  You can love everyone--but not be IN love (romantically speaking) with everyone. Good for you!|`|VoVMzklmaa	I don't believe it's possible to be 'in love' with everyone. You many think you love everyone, but I promise you don't. There's too many people. You'll never meet everyone, or form a bond or connection that will last long enough for you to even love them, led alone be in love. Also, you can like everyone, including enemies. If you're religious and believe in God, he says we're supposed to love our enemies no matter what. If not, then that's fine. Either way.|`|UANpgVupaa	Absolutely - why not? There is no reason why we can't love everyone around us. Knowing them or not. Yes, that includes our haters too. Why not have an open heart. I mean, if we could only love one one person, then we wouldn't go from mate to mate. We wouldn't go through boyfriends/girlfriends. We totally have the capacity. It's all about finding it.|`|KbD5cp3haa	i think it is, i also seem to be really caring for everybody i know, even if i dont know them very well personally, i know i would die for them|`|u93oneUXaa	I think you mean that you really really enjoy people.. not that you're "in love" with them.. and yes it's possible. I wish I was that way.. it would be nice to see the best in everyone for a change!|`|lecAdFRvaa	Honestly? No. You're probably a really nice person and I don't mean to sell you short but maybe you don't know what love is. When you meet that person you'll know what love is.|`|HNqTivmdaa	hmm...let me tell u 1 thing.dnt love evry1 coz sumtimes that may make u too sensitive.try to be gud n polite wid every1.in love only with the people with whom u maintain a very  close relationship.|`|nRT7sPXQaa	Being in love and having affection for humanity are two different things. Maybe consider a career in philanthropy?|`|M1B1EvI7aa	you probably don't really know what love is<br>  not in a bad way you just haven't had an experience<br>  [hate and possably love too]|`|66Fhsm0vaa	its possible to love everyone...but not be IN love with everyone. but hey, i guess this just means that your a happy, nice person! good job! lol|`|N8S9hp8Naa	yeah sure, if you consider your haters lovers. than sure you can love everyone.(:|`|n1RqtQ4Naa	um its probably not like "love"<br>  but like a brother and sister love <br>  i think its nice :)|`|8VtqxobDaa	since u love me soooooo much y don't u have hot sex with me tonight my place 10 p.m.  either sex or both.|`|aT7YJy3Kaa	youve been smoking what now?|`|lKLE2VAeaa	yeah cuz God told us ta love evry1 as much as you love urself|`|4eVqfDTdaa	Loving people and being in love are different things.  So no.  But I think it's great that you find good in everyone!  I wish more people were like that!  :-)|`|95VQLS3Paa	not IN love, but just love them 4 who they are.|`|RIlvWSE7aa	Only if you are a whore.....or love your enemy's!
UANpgVupaa	Homey, men are wired that way. Sex is on their brains often. However, just because they are wired that way - doesn't leave room for him to treat you that way. If he loves you he will understand and wait for you to be ready. If he loves you he won't give you a guilt trip to sleep with him. I have never heard of a man loosing his sexual peak. What the hell is that? If that were the case all men after the age of 21 would be bad in bed and there would be no point in even being intimate at all. Sounds like a guilt trip if you ask me. I know plenty of men who are very sexual and well over 21. Don't give into him. If you are not comfy just yet, you get to let him know that again and be honest with him about how you feel. There is no way to get him to slow down. He will slow down if he cares about you.|`|kHs0SFctaa	Maybe he's ready but if he really loves you like he say he does he'll wait for you, but sex is something that shouldn't be rushed and for me 5 months isn't long enough either. If he's rushing you into it then he's being disrespectful towards you and not considering your feelings.|`|wHgBnMipaa	If he is throwing around excuses like that he will lose his sexual peak, then it sounds to me like he's trying to guilt you into having sex with him.  Just stand your ground, don't give in, and if he persists, you need to realize that maybe he is just interested in having sex with you and nothing more.|`|9c27503b79201fde467bfe0f1ef26915aa	Tell him Hugh Hefner has like 3 young girlfriends and probably sleeps with all of them so.. please. He's just being an idiot and trying to guilt/pressure you into having sex with him before it's "too late".<br>  <br>  In my opinion he doesn't love you. A man who TRULY loves a woman will expect nothing, and ask for nothing, especially something like that. He will be happy hugging you.<br>  <br>  That's just my opinion. Save yourself for someone more worth it. I'd say talk to him about it, and if he still makes excuses, then.. it'd be best if you break up.|`|DaurttTJaa	Well first of all, if he really cares about you and respects you, he will not pressure you. As for the sexual peek, that is a load of bull, he is just trying to play on your emotions so you will have sex with him. He sounds like one of those guys that as soon as you do sleep with him, then he will move onto someone else. Right now, you are a challenge to him, and so he is intrigued by you.|`|gpX0FXu3aa	If you don't want to sleep with him you shouldn't. When I was in high school I waited 2 years to sleep with my girl friend. Admittedly, now that I'm 19, I would be frustrated if a girl wanted me to wait even a few months.  <br>  <br>  However if a guy really loves you, he'd go out with you even if he knew you could never have sex (for some reason).|`|akIpddDSaa	Please, i really dont think 21 he is going to loose anything.<br>  He has all the time in the world, and so do you.<br>  You may need to even sit him down. Set the boy straight, be the girl in charge. The sex life of you effects your life, if your not ready take that charge.<br>  Yours truly/best of luck!<br>  <br>  ~LisaNova|`|HPqCRBq8aa	Are you listening. The man is at his sexual peek. He is probably drilling holes through his bed right now. (lol)<br>  <br>  He won't lose his sexual peek at 21, that's bs. But he is horny as hell at that age.
biEhVH1Faa	look man i say u should get out of ur system if u dont u will for sure regret it. plus u will get more experience. better to do than regret for the rest of ur life. so like the doc said get some *****!|`|MUNO6Btfaa	Why go out and find out what you are "missing"? You really aren't missing much. Yeah, you could go out and do some really wild stuff; risk getting a disease, and then where will you be? I think it would be better to marry your girl and build your sexual world with her. Maybe you could go whore yourself out and find a chick that really rocks your world. How do you think she got that way? Do you really want to have a relationship with that type? If you marry this girl and something happens- for some reason you are not with her anymore, and you are fairly old, too old to pick up young wild chicks, go to Thailand. You can live out all of your wildest fantasies for under 100 bucks.|`|FpmplIXsaa	No, that's stupid.
jeXwL19taa	I understand how you feel it's not an easy thing to do. If he has been looking at you,  and you can tell he is interested, you can either; 1. as you said write him a note and ask him to prom  or try to pull him aside after class and ask him one on one. I mean most guys like it when a girl can take charge like that. Just be confident and it will all work out.|`|QtoDx4Vtaa	I would say start small and work your way up from there. Asking him to prom right off the bat might make him more shy. The main thing is to make sure that he does actually like you. You said he "might" like you. You have to make certain first.|`|Z3mHGD5Yaa	This question could have taken up one line, you didnt need to tell your whole life story,|`|fPpmgxjuaa	i dont think that would freak him out...somebody gotta break the ice...might as well be you...and u better do it b4 someone else does...he would prolly be into it...plus getting to know someone is always fun...|`|DrFRgtG3aa	nah he'd be happy someone did something|`|IiJH6wF5aa	do it.  Worse that would happen is that he says no and ur in the same position ur in now.|`|qd7KSchQaa	i think notes are good but sometime us guys may think it may be a prank but if u go and talk to the person then it would be more formal|`|JDmy2UHCaa	guys always like being asked out just ask him in person <br>  no way he will turn you down|`|d3n5Wchvaa	write a note and leave it on his desk before he sits down, it'll be all mysterious.|`|ejrxNVD1aa	you should try to shake it off and speak to him [=
5OLj2qpbaa	Pray for them to be forgiven.
LgUPXqw2aa	i think the best thing to do is talk to him about it... ask him if its too much stress for him to deal with. Turns out it might not be at all. honestly though, i wouldnt take much advise from us strangers on YA. while we have a synopsis of your relationship, we arent there. talk to him and then decide further.
n708rCp0aa	yeeeah, i would!<br>  its not genuine. just copied.|`|3pnQ5zhWaa	umm yea i will just<br>  for the heck of it<br>  but i will probably not be interested
S7Ppy7qiaa	say hi to him, go up and hang on him, he's probably shy, he'll get over it and think he's the sh*t if you' do that.. either that or you did something and he's pissed, or has nothing to say....<br>  <br>  edit- you kind of have to have a feel for the person, if he's not talking and shy just go up not talk to him but just smile and hang out.|`|e8d3b3207846607c507e3dc6eaca10edaa	He has nothing to say...so he says nothing.|`|qo2u1BCoaa	he is an inconsiderate person. no great loss. why not speak to him?|`|nImqyINuaa	ok i am a girl.... and i think that maybe the reason he is not talking to you could be that maybe he is nervous around you. depending on the relationship you had before. maybe he is mad at you or maybe he just really has no words for you. you should just go talk to him and find out why he is not talking you and get his answer, not his friends or something.<br>  <br>  hope i helped :)|`|ACxHyEeXaa	He says nothing, so he has nothing to say.
QWDOkz2Eaa	As for the first question; yes. Its so much more passionate and intimate... I find it adds a little extra something.<br>  <br>  As for the second part... yes as well. I liked it because well, I don't know to be honest, it is a sign of passion and interest, so it is pretty flattering when it happens :)|`|CS9qmGHtaa	Yes i have...I figured it was better to put my hands on his face and neck rather than other places considering i am only fifteen and a half...lol<br>  <br>  Yes i have had my face held...i didnt mind it at all...I feel like it is a little more passionate feeling i dont know why it feels that way...it isnt a sexual feeling...it is just passionate i supose...|`|esXp2ENEaa	IDk but i love it!!! I like the last answer too!|`|oOrOTd3Kaa	I do this all the time. I keep hoping my boyfriend will feel special..not sure if it works. He does it back only sometimes, and it feels great.|`|qjcTgXcZaa	I do it all the time. I don't know why, it's just my thing.
cHBcR0Chaa	Adriana, has a better sound. rolls off the tongue better. and seems like an all around sweet name.|`|Wf8ENQvCaa	I like Adriana.|`|kCftfTdHaa	catalina|`|9dc7211c44c17097c672d814b9900b0faa	neither are very pretty if you ask me.
Hek7MUNYaa	eat healthy<br>  dress nice<br>  be nice<br>  brush your teeth<br>  drinks a lot of water|`|p1k5GOvgaa	How to look Glamorous,ALL of the time?<br>  Ok. This is an extremely simple question to answer.<br>  NEVER,EVER,EVER....NEVER..have Children.<br>  Amen.<br>  X|`|fynzkVK4aa	Get embalmed in a perfect state.|`|Zadysvg5aa	stop looking in the mirror, it has a habit of biting you back.
N7gOE1btaa	No.  Sometimes people start their relationship spending every second together, this will slowly ease as you become more comfortable and trusting of not being around the other person, or when you have established yourselves well enough to be able to be apart for a period of time.  If you love being around eachother and are eachother's best friends, then why not spend the time?  Go for it..enjoy it while you can.  Sometimes life will get in the way, so if you got the chance to be together now, then do it!
VkVyuq5baa	nah it's more intense. I like it like that :)|`|ajzdsUldaa	If you love the person you're making out with, I don't think you'd feel uncomfortable for any reason.<br>  <br>  Some are more self-conscious though I guess.|`|TAMGy07Daa	i might put some music on, but i myself love the sounds that we make while making out, thank you...|`|CBrVs8H5aa	i never found it awkward|`|sYRXaS9taa	nope lol doesnt make me uncomfortable|`|Pdex43zgaa	Yes. I put on some music and light some candles. It's nice to be romantic to the sound of loud screamo and my house burning down.|`|XBYiHaWIaa	No, all the breathing and kissy noises and moaning is sexy and adds to the fun =D
PaeMq7EPaa	the next time you find yourself in that kind of setting you can do one or two things or maybe both first you go down on him and give it to him orally and if he resists then sit somewhere he can see you and start to masturbate you know play with your nipples and spread your legs apart and slip the finger in and around your V box and if that don't anything then dump his *** ad kick him to the curb cause if happen to me i would totally rise to the occation big and hard if you know what i mean lol so there try that out hope it works.|`|pDqsFgjyaa	I think your "boyfriend" needs to find himself a boyfriend on xbox live.....<br>  <br>  I can see no possible explanation for his reacting this way.... <br>  <br>  <br>  Just Unplug it next time, that'll get his attention :)|`|2WnbP80Taa	honey at my age get you a good xbox--it will last longer|`|Dxe7FDeYaa	He either missed the hint or thinks of you as a friend. Do you have any friends. HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|O0pYOOpAaa	I like sex but sometimes I'd rather play some Halo.|`|gRXngD9aaa	He's gay.  Get a real man.  Tell him I said this.<br>  <br>  What a loser he must be.|`|sQTMvSYqaa	don't mess with a bro's xbox... bítch
0ktcvglRaa	For me, it depends on how long I've known them. If it's someone I have just met recently, I find it easy to look them in the eye. However, if it's someone I've known for a long time and have only recently come to like, I totally can't make eye contact because I'm way too nervous!|`|lK3TXGBOaa	lol yea i used to have a crush in this guy from high school and one time my friend and i were walking to class and she knew i liked him and gues what she DID!!!! that ***** pushed me towards him!!! OMG!!! i was so embarrassed i turned so red i looked at him straight in the eye and then looked down because i was so embarrased plus i was all red!! and yeah i did get nervous... i always do to this date if the guy is cute i really wont look at them because it just makes me more nervous... i try to avoid eye contact ( which is bad )|`|78e9wgUaaa	Depending on ur personality if ur the shy type then yes ur'll probly get a nervous breakdown but if ur not...u have butin to fear|`|8ca92533138d363609f0fc127a9b053aaa	I think that it's hard or uncomfortable to make eye contact with the person you're attracted to if you're not dating yet. But once you start, it's not a big deal. It's quite nice actually =)|`|xKpllrKnaa	I look into the eyes of the ppl i like more than ppl i dont.  Simply because i think of this very question.|`|Wy0lUjP9aa	I know I do, because I don't want them to know. I am trying to break out of it so I don't look suspicious. lol.|`|uojR7vmEaa	no i love to look people in the eyes i can see there emotions!!!|`|B2PW3sUKaa	yes|`|vxMe4jUWaa	Well, in the beginning it is suuuper hard! ^__^ That's because you're kinda afraid that he's not that attracted to you. You have to ease into it a little and make your gaze last a little longer everytime....(not like hours...haha) But, it is very nerve-wracking at first because you don't know how they'll react. Keep you stare soft and don't glare. ^__^ As soon as you feel the person trusting you more and opening themselves, it will become very easy to gaze into their eyes! :]|`|eXwnWqROaa	i think it depends on what kind of person you are. If your confident then you tend not to really think about it to much, if anything you can go out of your way to look into there eyes erotically.... If your shy and introvert then yea you do tend not to make to much eye contact... The eyes are like looking into someones soul!!!...|`|aT7YJy3Kaa	yeah, bc its like idk, i feel like they can see into me and all my secrets [like that i like him], but eye contact shows ur interested so i try REALLYREALLYREALLY hard to do it, bc guys say i neverever act like im interested when i so am.|`|ysaM0ORRaa	i dont but the guy i like right now is basically my best friend too|`|e95c60def7314e19e9021c46eaa5fea1aa	yeah because the eyes are like a doorway...and people tend to read others through their eyes...<br>  <br>  and its also human nature to believe that everyone knows what they are thinking through their eyes|`|DwiQ66qyaa	nope...you just stare and stare and wish they could be yours:)<br>  <br>  someone pleaseeeeeeeeee answer mine <br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090309204315AAVEvM0">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|wuZXqYPGaa	uh not really.. but when i do look at them in the eyes--thats when i DO get nervous. you focus on their eyes more than anyother person its wierrd|`|uu4Tr99naa	For me it's harder, If I look at their eyes I'm afraid I'll stare too long and they'll get suspicious.|`|M1B1EvI7aa	im a girl<br>  and i enjoy it ^^<br>  boys usually get nerves|`|bvnSjdmeaa	YES..i do but when you look back you LOVE that feeling of butterflies in your stomach.|`|a5jLi0S6aa	HELL YES|`|hNFtO9vXaa	no not really..|`|n1RqtQ4Naa	with the guy i like YES!|`|lnRMmSeyaa	haha yea i never thought about it but i do!|`|quPY9x7qaa	not if you really want them to know how you feel|`|YDRqfuv8aa	no.i lvoe him && can just stare at his eyes..like stright into them forever..not nervous at all|`|dwGh0qB9aa	I used to get a little nervous when I looked into my crush's eyes.  But then, once you look into the eyes for a few seconds, the nervousness relaxes and actually everything seems better.  And do look that person in the eyes, eyes are some of the most beautiful things ever.  They tell a lot about the person.  If they're passionate, lying, sweet, excited, not a good person, etc.<br>  <br>  It may be hard, but look them in the eyes??|`|bZLW4IJXaa	I used to have a hard time looking into the eyes of the guy I was attracted too, and I would get really nervous when I did. If my eyes caught theirs I would quickly look away. The stereotypical middle schooler move. As I've gotten older, I find myself being able to look into my crushes eyes, and not feel nervous. It's more of an excited feeling now.|`|P0oggVFQaa	Definitely, for some people. I find myself wanting to look into the eyes of the one I like though, and we have a very good friendship.|`|8pIMXnt2aa	sometimes, the eyes are the window to the soul :)|`|SYijzAq3aa	no you actually don't.Unless you really like him so much that you're gonna cry if he says ur weird so he hates you. If not no.|`|MtpO6RUiaa	NO, for me i want to look at them all the time, and i always look at their eyes first. but yes i do get nervous.|`|4b0af5311f2d55ba03672ac9a75178b8aa	absolutely. If they don't like me i'm afraid I will make a mistake and ruin a friendship.|`|BAXwTEAvaa	No i just want to gaze into my boyfriends eyes for an eternity|`|LgUPXqw2aa	yes i do... unless i have some liquid courage! LOL|`|1gGkP5fgaa	i used to, but i grow some balls|`|xHI2QwOtaa	I can only look into his eyes. I mean I think people's eye's are their best feature, no matter who. So, I always look at their eyes. And when I first meet someone I look in their eyes to determine them. Your eyes can say a lot about you :D|`|CNSGz12zaa	If you are autistic, otherwise no.|`|K2Soawplaa	yes !<br>  <br>  theirs this guy i like, and he has the most gorgeous grayish-blue eyes.  when he's talking to me, i can't look at them !<br>  <br>  but when he's not, i can stare at them all day<br>  <br>  <br>  :D|`|QcUkrLWraa	I just get nervous to because I don't want them to know. So I avoid it.|`|Cn9WIJhgaa	No, because you love that person and therfore their is nothing to be nervous about.|`|ckj8O1TNaa	no its easier, unless I am nervous
ex5MUFP8aa	I'm so sorry but it basically means as soon as they take him off life support he will pass away.|`|U4V6TkZEaa	It means that he will never wake up or speak again.  I'm sorry dear.|`|2tn8EALqaa	I'm really sorry, perhaps Yahoo Answers wasn't the best place to come...<br>  <br>  Brain dead means the brain is not going to fuction anymore. It is permanent.

aOy01jFEaa	Rita dearest, I think that I can figure it out from direct and indirect experiences as well as from some wise people that there can be many coincidences of love. But what really matter is that it wasn't 'real' (or the highest type of love we long for with the other)..The reason that can make one change so easily ending up some like a 'merry go round' just to try while 'seeking' for the real thing as 'love'. <br>  From there that we may gain or lose in life depending on how we carry on the effects of those met experiences..That's why some became wiser and the others become lost from their path. Losing a sense of oneself plays the big part of getting confused about some slight and horrible failures..<br>  Rita...I have known some very few couples who really did 'CLICKed' to eachother like a fairy tale, to hear their love stories since they met ..That's why too, the reason that some others still believe to hold on to their brighter hopes. Because of these very few 'magical like' occurrences, that only began with some 'coincidences'..We may even ought to know that these people have been conscious (as you are too), with the value of the spirit that bonds their magnificent love..(It is profound to be described in words)<br>  My notion about it, is just when 'it's about the right given time' that is truly meant to be a real and blessed 'coincidence', regardless of whatever form did the meeting start taking its place to manifest..<br>  Anything can be prone to 'dramatical changes' as events and time swiftly flow towards that certain destined path to meet with an open heart, when it already presented itself to your most deserving moment in life..<br>  <br>  It is also in nature..((((huggies))))<br>  <br>  Our meeting too (as friends here), has some significance beyond Rita..all of us here. I think.<br>  Is it coincidence?..I can't live forever...This is my time and 'Our' time too..<br>  If this was suppose to happen then coincidences itself could have been 'meant to be' (or happen for some purposes). <br>  <br>  So as the process of those who are still in search for the truest one..could find it seemingly rough and endless. But that is just because we're still learning and maybe for the purposely naturally 'READYING' ourselves to meet that particular 'soul' meant for one's 'truest and everlasting' LOVE..(and to fill that real purpose)<br>  I feel it that way..Cause I believe that there are real 'great' reasons even for the purpose of the word itself 'HOPE'..<br>  Nothing can be completely fruitless in 'searching'..especially when you help yourself find it..<br>  This makes me think of the possibility of having more than one lifetimes and a 'WILL' to fulfill..Since so many still have died heartbroken..(sob')|`|yuuvBSKsaa	We are awash in a sea of coincidences.<br>  <br>  It's like asking if there is no water in the ocean|`|7d18ef265f8005b212e412b385d0c4bbaa	If  we look at 'Love' in a very narrow  way  it might look that  that there are no co incidences  but deliberate  steps  at building a relationship.  I look at it differently , though .<br>  <br>   We constantly come across relationships in life .Some of them are 'imposed' like the case of parents , siblings etc. The others are evolved relationships. All these demand giving and  receiving of love . They all  appear to be incidental but , I believe , they are all predetermined or reprogrammed . Some amongst those relationships evolve faster and better  and a different plane of Love is discovered .|`|AA11894640	Well,  I don't know how to answer this,  Rita!<br>  <br>  Love itself seems like a result of coincidences at times.  Only when the series is 'unplanned' by either party,  do we accept it as God's Plan for us!|`|0047572b741498da2d839902d6863185aa	love is always challenging time and space.<br>  time and space shut down so love can show up at a moment of nowhere.<br>  <br>  love<br>  Pluto
TC21ao0Paa	Yes, I do believe that there is someone for everyone but, this will seem contradictory as I do not believe that it is limited to only one person.<br>  My reasoning is that as we grow and change ( hopefully for the better), we may come across someone " Special " that we may have overlooked in the past.<br>  I do believe that in finding someone special, it just happens by chance. You cannot look for it as. For some reason, we cannot find who we are looking for, someone that shares our interests, our goals, equal ( or, at least, close to) maturity levels, among other similar characteristics.<br>  Fate intervenes .|`|oytbZuIkaa	I think that there is definately more than one special one for most of us. Of course there will be the odd occasion when 2 people have been together all their life (only having one special partner), but this is quite rare. It is different for us all, but if you find someone who you feel good to be with, then take the chance on them and see where it leads. If you are lucky to fall in love again, grab it with both hands and enjoy life...|`|04bSzgxgaa	There is some one special I think for everyone. The key,I, believe is though that we could spend the rest of our lives waiting, longing , hoping that the special one turns up soon. It may be we realise that they have been and gone never to return again. I have been there and through that.I try now, to see my self as that special person for someone else, its not easy and can be lonely too, but there it is.|`|yuuvBSKsaa	I find the notion of a single soulmate somewhat absurd.<br>  <br>  Most have many they would be quite compatible with BUT..<br>  <br>  Some desire what does not exist and so are compatible with no one.<br>  <br>  The sensibility of your dreams determine the number of your 'soulmates'.  <br>  <br>  Your commitment to treat your love kindly determines if they remain so.|`|MJ7BvT7zaa	There are many..but it is not as if they are "ready made." If one is found of an honest heart and desire to share their innermost thoughts and feel free to do so...without thought of condemnation...better get `em while you can. They are a rare commodity...  Proverbs 31:10-31 is a wonderful thought, but to find a man to go with her is an even further stretch these days...|`|w2qV8WEmaa	Finding someone to love is easy.<br>  <br>  Finding someone who love you is the difficult part.<br>  <br>  Life is not fair and nothing is perfect.<br>  <br>  Therefore, it is absolutely impossible that there is someone special for everyone.|`|AA11894640	That seems to be the common belief!  One specially made for the other...ek duje ke liye!<br>  <br>  Some people believe in sample testing before deciding on THE  ONE!  Some MAKE the one they are with, Special.  <br>  <br>  There aren't any rigid rules...|`|0047572b741498da2d839902d6863185aa	difficult to answer that Rita<br>  <br>  it is either you find him/her (one) or not at all.<br>  <br>  love<br>  Pluto|`|F3LBgfvwaa	Of course there is more than one person. There are tons of people that you could be compatible with.|`|NAGiNKFWaa	No, I don't believe there is a special someone for everyone.  I do not believe that all people find love in their lifetime.  I think animals can love you, but not people.
PO5Q7POuaa	Yes I like guys to be straight up because personally I am quite slow to catch on to things. Like I've had guys ask me out and I haven't realized until one of my friends points it out to me. <br>  In general I find that when everyone is straight up and cuts out all the crap life is a lot easier. Because what is the point of b.s your way through life?
iocCNTUqaa	Girls are very observant. She could be attracted to you, or she could just be a very verbal person. Its hard to tell. I tell my guy friends all the time "I like those pants on you." "You hair looks dirty." "I love your shoes." Sometimes it means something, sometimes it doesn't.|`|2eFIzND0aa	that she probably  really likes your looks ,or she probably likes you.|`|1baSSCDmaa	It's this little thing people like to call conversation.|`|hKd21emDaa	Hmmm....I would say that it all depends on the context. If you guys are alone, then you know what it means.|`|zu8Tb48Xaa	she's probably checking you out and then starts to notice your flaws...|`|1JSblCBsaa	It depends on the tone of voice....usually it means nothing. It's just friendly banter|`|sgRDJUXqaa	She's your friend and is giving you advice.  Or she's not your friend and is bold enough to make fun of you to your face.<br>  <br>  I would not tell a guy that I liked that he needed to shave; that would be implying that he is not the perfect guy I think he is, lol.|`|0ky4TktEaa	Depends on the dynamics of the conversation and the relationship of the two people involved. If this girl is someone you aren't flirting with/like etc, she's probably making an observation and commenting on the fact that your chin's looking scraggly. She may also be suggesting you'd look better if you shaved, in her opinion. <br>  <br>  In other words, it's an observation followed by a comment. It can be positive, negative or flirty. You have to look at more than just the statement to figure out what's behind it. What does her expression suggest?|`|XrtmT2kUaa	We are mysterious creatures and what makes us tick is even harder to figure out. It probably just popped in her head, really nothing personal. It just happens. Don't sweat the little stuff.|`|TAMGy07Daa	they are interested in your hygiene , and prefering that if you'd "shave" you'd look more attractive.|`|XwyUATsKaa	She likes you. It's her way of picking on you to show you she likes you.  Immature, but it works for us women too!  :)
R0U4qy6haa	no-thank you|`|iOpzTvSpaa	sorry my quota for creepy internet relationships is already full at zero
veZLfnGFaa	You just didn't start loving him, so you can't just stop loving him. To stop loving him is going to take some time.  You are hurt, so now's your chance to begin the process of moving on.  Don't look back and don't feel sorry for yourself.  Just hold your head up and see what happens.  You'll be fine - it just takes time.  Good  Luck ;)|`|uLHtXibRaa	You cannot stop something like love..i feel the same about my ex partner..and i dont even want to move on..i have no desire....to find anyone else..and there isnt anything i can do but live each day in the hope it will fade..
UIRQ6hjPaa	Constantly and Im nearly 30, Im also married :)<br>  <br>  I dont care gives me a little thrill when I can daydream about stuff like that, gives me confidence and makes me smile :)<br>  <br>  Nothing wrong with it, just dont expect it to ever happen heheh|`|dCYbGaUuaa	I had a crush on a celebrity...he wasn't that famous, but he was known...he was a football player and he came n2 my store a couple of times... we started flirting and actually dated....my manger also did the same thing with another football and basketball player....so it really could happen..I didn't believe that until it happen...lol|`|rNyBkedoaa	yeah and thats me...waityo whos your crush???
hwIMJBVpaa	you wanna go get a drink later?|`|14SHluVyaa	No, a lot of girls will respect you for that.|`|Hss5hJP8aa	As long as you're not a 40-year old virgin.<br>  <br>  Actually, it's perfectly normal.  Some girls even find it sexy.|`|xJ2kcJsraa	iunno. do you plan to be something good in your life? like a Dr.?<br>  <br>  if so....no.<br>  <br>  but if you're still in like...college and like making poor grades. then yessir.|`|wHgBnMipaa	You're fine.  Don't worry about it.  I think men who save themselves are really sweet.|`|hjViDMAEaa	Nothing wrong. I seen non-virgins who are truly losers.|`|l9SYaK4zaa	I wouldnt flaunt it. But i would use it to my advantage saying it was a personal choice and that you are holding out until u meet someone really special. And once u do meet a girl u can tell her ur a virgin and that u want her to be ur first so she would feel really special. (but make sure she is special)  I wouldnt worry about it too much it will happen when it happens i lost my virginity when i was 18 and it happened when i felt like i was goin to die a virgin but then i met this girl and we connected (mentally no pun intended) and then we connected (physically pun intended lol). You will be fine.|`|sgfGvjs0aa	i think it's attractive. When you give yourself to your wife/gf in their mind they will sort of be thinking "wow i'm going to be the first" and if the both of you really love one another it will be like it was meant to be and you will finally get to see with that special someone if sex is really all that it's cracked up to be.|`|2bkV73gpaa	Why would a girl think you are gay because you're on a date with her and you admit that you're a virgin? That's silly.<br>  <br>  Besides, you said it yourself: you havem't found the right girl yet who you feel comfortable enough with to have sex.<br>  <br>  Okaaaay. Just why is that?<br>  <br>  Maybe those girls did not feel comfortable with you? It's a two-way street.|`|Px990WYDaa	noo, your not a loser. the girl you loose it to will probably enjoy it more cuz she can teach you a few things.|`|kQ370aPXaa	pick up some random chick on the street and fukc the shiit outta her! haha. maybe if we both get lucky it'll be me. nah but girls like it when ur a virgin. unless yous ugly! but you said yous self u not so..

dCYbGaUuaa	Are you sure that he likes you???... If he does, I would just tell him since he is going off to Germany, that we should hangout together sometime... R if u r trying to pursue more than just going out and u want to be exclusive than I would just keep it HONEST all the way... I would tell him that I feel that we have a connection and you just want to see where it could go...But since you are best friends, be careful so you will not ruin your friendship... it can happen wither way...<br>  ~~**GOoD LucK**~~
wI3AAkIoaa	I would not believe a word of it.  While on dating sites I heard many stories, not this exact one, but stories just the same.  If there is any truth to it, you are in no way what so ever to blame.  So people are just lonely and want others to talk to, when they do not fulfill their needs they try and hurt you any way they can.  Trust me I do believe it to be a 100% lie without a doubt.  And true love only happens after you meet face to face, you can only think you know what you feel before.|`|Eg1G2mvVaa	Controlling, possesive, demanding, critical of you, throwing mad accusations your way.....<br>  <br>  If he never hits you I will be amazed!|`|ajzdsUldaa	The big give-away is that you are online friends. He is likely to be making all of these stories up because he is lonely and likely to be depressed.<br>  <br>  In any case, even if he is telling the truth, this guy is manipulative and abusive. I agree with the his statement of "true love happens once", but this is certainly not true love. The way he is treating you certainly does not constitute as love, in my books.<br>  <br>  He plays with your feelings and makes you feel bad for things that are not your fault. This is emotional abuse.<br>  <br>  If I were in your situation, I'd stay the Hell away from him. I've seen this kind of behaviour from men, and 9 times out of 10 their behaviour goes from emotional abuse to physical.

DcrI9zmkaa	You aren't going to "get in a relationship" with her or anyone else until you set aside your shyness and just go for it.  She isn't going to magically become your girlfriend.<br>  <br>  As for the other girls, what does it even matter what they think?  *She* is the one you're asking out.
8f56665103aa616bdeed10432894494eaa	Hi ,<br>  <br>    I exactly how you feel and Make feel about My situation, as your 5th guy , He finds me in English class, football jock ,pretended to be just like you, treated with respect, helped me with my promblems, later I find out<br>  he's is motherF...... J .... calls me ulgy puts me down in front of him .<br>   And you know what I still have feelings of Like , want to be his girl.<br>  And To your answer, from my experience ,  IT's not the guys , those <br>  Stuck Up Smiley Girls should be slapped . YEs, they like them as jerks, and here's the truth boy ,  for you Why those guys, it's their Killer looks,those girls die and want to be with their good loooks and sexniess , They coudn't give Dam about personaity , respect in them <br>  where you should be very proud of that . I mean it, Don't be like , cause those are jerks along with jerky Bi... misibersele Girls who just want Sex from them . Trust me, Don't hurt or pretend to be like My 5th guy example for you.  I'm distaught of letting go of him and it's hard , y<br>  But I have to cause my not going to be those could of girls. Remember They have no life or reltionship where you will oneday Be<br>  happier to be true to gilrs from what you are then those guys and will<br>  get a girl who loves you . Hope this helps you understand ,  You'll<br>  very kind guy , it's not the confidence promblem, it's problem of youre <br>  at moment at why can't have that , they do, They only have a sex  than a real trye reletionship which you will have and better then them.<br>  Good luck, free feel to talk to me on this if you want as  a fan|`|F0sJR0jbaa	Dude EVERY guy looks at porn.  Come on.  And strip clubs arent bad.  Probably because your too uptight.|`|mDBHMJPjaa	maybe your not looking in the right spots|`|1S0zHM8Kaa	This is a common questions which generally manifests itself in the form "Why don't nice guys ever get the gf? Why do jerks get the girl?"  The reason that the jerk gets the girl is because he is non needy.  A man who possesses the qualities of an alpha male (leader of social group, good with other woman, confident, don't need validation from others) are very attractive to woman. <br>  <br>  Unfortunately, nice guys finish last because they do not have the qualities of an alpha male.  Nice guys generally: give way too many compliments, show interest very early without knowing the woman too well, etc etc.  When woman see guys actually really sweet and nice so quickly with out even knowing her, she might think you are doing it just because you want something from her or you think she is beautiful.<br>  <br>  So, even though i personally don't know these men and don't personally know you, I can come to the conclusion that you may fit into the "nice guy" and that these 4 men fit into the "alpha male". <br>  It's why so many jerks end up with great girls and the girls stick with them.<br>  <br>  I am not saying you should cheat or be disrespectful like these other guys are, but maybe you should change the way you talk to girls?  You didn't mention how to interact with woman, but you might just tease girls a little more, act more flirtatious and playful, act care free and confident, and be more hard to get.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps man, good luck!|`|bWpYLSKSaa	I think that those women just have low standards, or they aren't the brightest lights in the harbor. You're probably looking for women that have minds, and maybe they just aren't interested in dating or don't think that you are right. Keep in mind, a lot of women look for the perfect person, even if it is unreasonable. If you keep on looking for someone, you're bound to find a woman who makes you happy.|`|oBhC7kAuaa	please please dont decide to be a jerk to women<br>  <br>  the bottom line is that people act weird when they are abused because they think that they have done something wrong and have low self-esteem<br>  <br>  so exploiting this is a very simple way to get women, but it is also completely detestable and very damaging to the woman<br>  <br>  keep trying|`|9WAtB40aaa	That's just how it is unfortunately, i feel the same way allllll the time and ive tried working out all possible explanations why it is like this and i cant find a logical one so ive just come to a conclusion that, thats just how it is.|`|8SJl74CQaa	i think that right there is bull! there stupid to go back to them! they would be lucky to have a guy that treats them Right! like you!;]|`|FoWxxqTjaa	you sound like a great guy...you don't want girls like them anyways. you'll want a woman with morals, and strong beliefs. <br>  <br>  don't be jealous of your guy friends...they're jerks. one day they will all be envious and want the relationship you have with your future girlfriend/wife because you know how to treat a woman right. don't change...and good things will come your eventually. but you have to be patient. it's tough, but when you finally do meet her, it will all be worth it.<br>  <br>  hope this helped.<br>  good luck.|`|FrXvu82Kaa	I know this is going to sound strange, but stop trying. Sometimes love comes when you least expect it. Let love find you. Keep being the guy you are and you will find someone. I know it is tough, but when you find someone your relationship will be far better than you ever thought!! It will be worth the wait.<br>  As for those other guys they sound like typical guys. You sound like the kind of guy that girls want but, are afraid to be with. A lot of girls feel like they are not good enough, so they sometimes settle for second best. Don't ever settle or change who you are!<br>  I hope this helps!! Good luck!!|`|LrhOWIs0aa	Most girls like stupid guys.  For the first guy looking is not cheating so its better than him doing it for real.  The second Guy has control issues he likes to put her down to make himself feel better.  The girl must be insecure and does not know her worth.  The third guy cheated on her but if they have been together this long one mistake should not mess that up.  They just need to work on their problems.  Now the fourth guy must like the traditional role of man and woman relationship.  The girl has to learn the hard way how she is supposed to be treated.<br>  <br>  My advice for you would be to find a girl who appreciates the qualities  that you have and give in a relationship.  You do not need to change yourself.  Just look for a relationship in a different way.  I tell all my friends to study a person.  You can tell by there attitude, body language, tone of voice how they want to be treated or if their personalities will not match yours. Just be yourself if a girl does not like it she is not right for you.  GOOD LUCK.|`|XjtZAFOyaa	its a sad situation because more women should be looking for better guys, but you will win in the end....these people you mentioned will eventually lose.  your chance of finding true happiness in the end is greater whereas these people its not ever going to get there|`|0ktcvglRaa	You're only looking at the bad sides of these relationships and not the good sides. Besides, you'd be surprised at how comfortable girls are with their boyfriends going to strip clubs and looking at porn. I wouldn't care if my boyfriend did those things! It's perfectly normal for most guys, anyway.
a3c6c459cb76599b92b05d066bdb8e6aaa	your the nice guy and SOME woman want to be treated like crap or they need to feel needed so they stay. Me i wouldnt put up with any of them except maybe you. :)|`|wE89mPZ3aa	Those women are just taking whatever they can get. No woman who has any respect for herself would put up with all that crap.  You want someone who wants to be with you because she knows you are the one.  Not someone who settles for what ever she can get. So hang in there and find a woman that is right for you and knows who she is. Do not settle for anything less.|`|3Fu1DkvZaa	Several women find themselves in a situation that they feel is the only "out" for them.<br>  Low self esteem, self hate, the feel that no one is there for them, etc.  hell pick one<br>  All I can tell you is to keep on keep-in' on..<br>  .|`|113FoyMFaa	some women LIKE being treated like that.  I do.  I like being told to get coffee, I like being told when to 'get naked', and so forth.|`|31ahiJabaa	Those girls just want to have fun. Perhaps you should lighten up a little. <br>  Have fun.|`|3iNobwVraa	Self fulfilling prophecy.  Reread your post and imagine it is about someone else.  How does this person feel about himself?  Does he feel confident and attractive?  <br>  <br>  It comes from within.  No gf will bestow this upon you, and your neediness (wanting to feel differently about yourself) is coming across loud and clear.  Change your thoughts about yourself and you will change EVERYTHING!  Read up.  There is loads of research on this!<br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|prDi2u4faa	I think those girls are desperate for acceptance, so they lowered their standards for pricks. I mean it may not be positive attention for her, but atleast someone depends on her.<br>  <br>  I think your right about treating women with respect. But I guess nice guys finish last, so you'll get a girlfriend, it may take a while but she'll be worth the wait.<br>  <br>  :]]
VjmTK6uZaa	Dont be so optimistic about this.  He is really thinking about it.  Don't rush him or think omg just cuz he didnt call means he doesnt want to.  Give him to time and space to think about this.  If he sais no then still be friends and maybe try again later, but as of now.   Just wait.  And no this does not mean rejection.
XrdCqMbgaa	well if he's thinking about it its a good sign because he's not into a definite no. therefore there might still be a chance for you two to get back together. maybe he was hurt and wants to think thoroughly cause he's scared he'll hurt again. however don't jump into conclusions. just wait for his answer. if he doesn't contact you, maybe you should ask him so that you would be able to move on with your life. but dont press him to get back with you. you dont want a man to be with you just because he feels sorry for you because it'll happen again soon and you'll get hurt much more. just give him his space. let the day pass. i believe he'll contact you :) goodluck
7BcBwW6Xaa	ha ha yeah it does. next time it happens just try to ignore it, because it's just natural. well it would kind of hard to because, it's right there against you. lol.|`|pDqsFgjyaa	Yes, it does. Again with everyone's previous answers its due to the blood rushing to it. The more turned on a guy gets the more blood pumps south and the harder/warmer it gets since the blood is circulating faster.|`|yt2zVOZfaa	Yes, since it gets engorged with blood which makes it warmer.|`|qjcTgXcZaa	No... It is warm down there naturally. And it may have seemed like it was getting warmer, but it's like when you put your cold hand on your arm, both your hand and arm will start feeling warmer.|`|awLr3uCaaa	I suppose so. I mean it fills with blood and gets really red so all of the blood could cause it to get warmer. Good question.
pOmjcVjZaa	I've been cheated on, like many people. I, personally, think it's because the person either a) wants to make the other person jealous; b) has his/her own insecurities; c) wants something they can't get from the other person; or d) wants to end the other relationship and begin a new one with the person he/she is cheating on with.|`|wI3AAkIoaa	They cheat because the one they love cannot or will not meet their needs. If you truly love someone, the thought will never occur.  I once had a husband have an ex girlfriend move in with us... I was told I would be killed if I said no... was it ok for me to cheat?  And yes he was sleeping with her.  He is an ex, but for over 3 years I had fear after leaving.|`|f03edf3d3fe5d3e7c31416dd3871939aaa	because their mates or boy friends are not giving them attention and romance and sex|`|uLHtXibRaa	Greed..gluttony..its a common fact..what the eye sees the eye wants...
Wy0lUjP9aa	Well I have scars left from acne, and if I was allowed to put pictures up, I would show you how noticeable they are. But anyways, don't let that bring you down, you should still have confidence. I still have confidence despite that, and I realized that people look past the scars and look at how you are as a person. I was shy when starting school (and the scars were one of my reasons) but people pointed out how I was so quiet so I began talking and stuff and people said they liked me more this way (with confidence) and they will laugh with me, they say "hi" to me and "bye" to me every day. Don't let it get in your way, also, you can get rid of blemishes without make up (I don't wear make up). There are plenty of ways: <br>  Tomatos (Tomatoes contain Vit A which can help repair the destroyed tissue, just rub the tomato on your skin for 10 min and wash off)<br>  Vitamin e oil (it is good to get a capsule because the oil in a bottle wears out, just prick the capsule and then put it on the area, you can leave it on overnight and do it for 3 times a day for 30 mins.)<br>  Lemon juice (The lemon contains Ph, and helps repair your skin as well, put on with a cotton ball and wash off in 10 minutes)<br>  Olive oil (I know it sounds ironic, but you can rub olive oil on the scars, they repair the skin as well and don't break you out that you think it would.)<br>  <br>  I am going to try these, but I never think of it when I have money. So try it. But it won't work in a day or three days, I think people started seeing results in a week or two and maybe even a month.|`|fmQIU0zqaa	By believing in yourself.|`|veZLfnGFaa	Go to a dermatologist - They can give you some options.  Then you'll have your confidence back.  Good Luck :)|`|G0qkBsBkaa	You could be a lot worse. Go to the store and see how many people have worse acne....how many people are fatter than you...how many people have worse hair cuts than you...how many people hunch...<br>  <br>  You could be a lot worse..|`|hjViDMAEaa	There are people with worse lives.

K6j21a6raa	I was dating my boyfriend Jon for about a year. He broke up with me, and we got back together about four days later. That didnt last very long. I met my boyfriend Joe during the four days Jon and i had broke up. Joe and i had a sexual realationship for a while, while Jon and i were together. Jon was my first Real love.  The first boy I ever did ANYTHING with. When he left me it killed me. It destroyed my soul, and ruined my world. Sex was the only thing that fed the void in my heart. I kept cheating on Jon with Joe, and eventually Jon and I broke up again. We kept going like that for about a month. Until i realized what i wanted, and it wasnt him...|`|63tch8D5aa	for me,<br>  it was and on again off again saying it, lets break up or you wanna break up,<br>  <br>  we have been dating for almost a year<br>  <br>  we ve had so many fights probaly mor ethan like 10 both of us saying its over and none of us will last, that we are to opposite,<br>  but its over something that either one of us did and realize we only said that because we are mad,<br>  and regret saying it and he has said we never have broken up just said it, is enough.<br>  <br>  <br>  sometimes i think i wanna break up,<br>  but i know i d be so lost without him,<br>  i need to just work with my insecuties.|`|cwAEsD1Naa	Usually if you break up a first time its for a reason.. and getting back together won't cure the issue at hand.. maybe you'll stay together for a while or maybe just a few days.. its kind of a general truth that relationships that constantly break up and get back together are disasters.. now thats not to say its never worked in the past.. all i know is the last time i did it we broke up the 2nd (and final time) a week later, which ended up causing so much more pain and hassle in the end
EhlHHwCFaa	Then ask him for a 3some or join in an orgy. tell him that you want to explore playing with others and if he is into it, he should also be allowed to play.<br>  <br>  Playing or fooling around behind your back is a different story though. Just do it together and have fun.
cHBcR0Chaa	yea, its a little crazy. you need to tone it down. back off a bit. let him have female friends, that way you can have male friends. you have to try not to get mad easily. depression is hard for you but harder for him b/c he has to deal with you in that state. seek help if it really is bad. if you like each other that much, you need to talk it out, work it.|`|T9KmnUUbaa	i have to admit i have acted the same way, more than a few times, but acting out this way will only push him away, you've really got to think about reacting in a  different way
PiWYjEQ9aa	she wanted u to make a move and so she waited 4 three weeks 4 ur dumb *** to make a move on her and now since she still likes ur dumb ***.. she made a move.. although, it could be a friend thing but it's not in this case because if she was trying stear clear of you, she wouldn't have txted u @ midnight saying happy birthday!.. so ya.. learn some dating and go practice 'em!

VjmTK6uZaa	He simply wants to get together with you.  He is apparently flirting with you and showing you that he will remember all the the small things in a relationship, long after you have forgotten about them.  Sounds like you guys could get together if you showd a bit of interest and like him as well.|`|uLHtXibRaa	Hes playing games..he isnt really interested in you but making you look an idiot if you say you will date him/hang around with him....and he can take that behind your back and have a good laugh at you behng your back...because hes warped..you do not make fun of a girl you really like..full stop....(E.G..shes a total (name)..and she so wants me..i have her all to myslef now and this should be funny...now...shes so stupid..etc etc)..dont take this boy crap as personal... this was done to me..many times..and i still grew into a happy confident woman who has dating successful in many ways,,so the prob lies with them and not you..they are immature enought to get their fun from girls..whom they know are in need of affection...but who are ultimately their saviours and they mess with they wrong girl.. pay the price..in their own reputation..and uture...|`|UBvhTWnaaa	he is a really good guy friend or he wants a little more its kinda hard to tell but propually is attracted to u|`|3pnQ5zhWaa	just ignore him<br>  is he like your boyfriend
rKlnYdBDaa	Stop hooking up. Slow down. Your hormones are in high gear. Dont allow the compromising positions to take place, have some self control.You have the rest of your life to have fun like this. you are allowing your body to tell your brain what to do. you are a woman, women get emotionally involved with sexual contact. I suggest talking to an older woman, maybe a sister or friend about this...they will tune you in.|`|rSXZOU5zaa	Well, you could try being less dramatic with the whole "im gonna ruin your life thing"<br>  <br>  You could stop hooking up with boys until you find one nice guy you like :)<br>  <br>  or you could tell that one guy you changed your mind and start talking to him again and see where it goes :)<br>  <br>   <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AhwZDPgnup9bEUEywpeDxtbsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090309194515AA1kBpW">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|3Pv32FxVaa	when you hook  up with people you should realize that the guy usually only wants to do it to appease his sexual appetite. <br>  <br>  a relationship should never be founded on a hook up.|`|SrMdpiIMaa	If you want to stop thinking about random guys that you hooked up with, stop hooking up with them!

kNwqpAMWaa	Sure you can do that, thee is no harm in just sending text to your friend and plus that doesn't show signs you like the guy and if a convo starts, just go with the flow......after all, youare just friends^_^
Hek7MUNYaa	haha your looking at her lol<br>  <br>  i love to be bitchy sometimes, but i also have feelings and i do tell sorry to people i love lol<br>  <br>  wow...what a quintessence|`|ajzdsUldaa	I'll be honest - you're dreaming. There are plenty of girls that might fit the majority of those characteristics, but I don't think there is a lot of girls that fit all of them.<br>  <br>  Especially the dominatrix part. In any case - you're the MAN, YOU'RE supposed to take charge in the bedroom! Women don't want wimpy men that expect them to be dominating.|`|EgGxVVrBaa	lol you're not searching for much ;]<br>  not trying to be rude, but how old are you?|`|XBYiHaWIaa	Aww hunny they don't exist.|`|Zadysvg5aa	a police woman might fit the bill. I knew one and she had all those qualities. go out and get arrested by the best looking one you can find, and then chat her up.
l0HDHguhaa	Every girl prefers it differently. Lol this actually happened to me today a guy i didn't know asked me for my number and since i didn't know him i told him some other time so he gave me his in case i change my mind.|`|LE6Vot7Kaa	I want him to take my number.. less pressure and I don't have to deal with thinking I'm calling to soon or something. I also don't give out my number to just anyone so I always get who I really want.|`|wtBOW2L0aa	i would want him to give me his.|`|Y7ZSaTOtaa	Ask her for her number first.  That makes more sense.  I mean you could just swap numbers.  Usually, if I have a genuine interest in the guy I would like for him to have my number if not then I tell them I will take their number knowing I will never call them.|`|0ktcvglRaa	The second one. If you ask for a girl's number, she might be afraid that you'll call her obsessively or something. If you give her your number, it's up to her whether to contact you or not! I also think this is more polite.|`|wuZXqYPGaa	i like it better wheen guys GIVE me their numbers, so then i wont be creeped out that they have my number and i can TEXT THEM if im interested, instead of havin possibly a wierdo textin me 24;7.|`|n1RqtQ4Naa	i dont think she would mind<br>  if you gave her your number <br>  it is very much so flattering :)|`|bw6iM8Nxaa	i like when a guy asks for mine.<br>  its soo wierd for some reason if a guy just like automatically assumes you want his number.<br>  and its less pressure if the guy asks for your number.|`|cOBk3NxQaa	why not just swap numbers? That's what I would prefer. then you dont have to wait for him/her to call you, you can keep in touch with each other.|`|8pIMXnt2aa	personally, id rather give a guy my number because then it puts them in control and when they decide to call or text it makes me feel happy :)|`|M1B1EvI7aa	ask her for her mobile num when she gives you hers give her yours<br>  and if shes doing anything special <br>  dont send her str8t away|`|eO5sddfLaa	ask for hers<br>  i hate when a guy give me his number cuz then i never know what to text him first<br>  cuz  dont wanna just be like hey <br>  whats up<br>  thats so lame
cHBcR0Chaa	Well that guy probably liked that a lot. you started dancing with him. you made first contact. and no its not wrong. he's probably thinking your a girl who knows what she wants and that intrigued him. stay with it, see how it pans out.
DIKmlfDLaa	I doesn't sound like she likes you in a "date me" way. She would be flirting, but not intending anything.<br>  If You like her, just ask. The worst is she'll say no (which isn't the end of the world).<br>  Good luck in figuring it out.|`|Xexi7KCJaa	sure sounds like it to me|`|Bgo0xmjnaa	Nope<br>  <br>  (duz that count as a real answer?<br>  tbh i don't really care)
8YqXuhRsaa	Cause he is a jerk, think the wide ranging generalisation is wrong though, he is a jerk not all guys are jerks (I really hate that stereotype). If he was a guy who had any kind of moral substance he would not have done that or if he cared about you like he said he did.|`|Z3mHGD5Yaa	Do you honestly expect an 8th grade boy to have an attention span of longer than a couple of hours?|`|nuM1IJ7taa	wow. you have recess?|`|pHgshfWOaa	I am in 8th grade to and i dont know why guys are jerks i mean they really are. They try to sucker u in then once u like them they pull away. <br>  I am going threw something like that right now...<br>  <br>  I am sorry|`|8gDRQ7v2aa	Sometimes I ask the same things about girls
oOrOTd3Kaa	Depends on the guy. My ex didn't care..and later it started to turn him on. My boyfriend now will not have sex with me on my period. <br>  <br>  Its a little messy...so just place a towel down.(that should cover it) Sex is more sensitive. Could hurt a little more/feel good a little more. It can be gross, or be totally natural. If you want to..go for it. If not..then don't. :)|`|mL07N3IAaa	i'm in the exact same situation with you! and i think that's gross..you don't wanna traumatize him when blood comes out do you?!?!? and if he's not experienced with these things with other women then he probably doesn't know what he's talking about.. hhah|`|wHgBnMipaa	Seems gross to me, but there isn't anything unsafe about it.  If you feel comfortable, go for it.|`|hjViDMAEaa	It is probably your bf's first time or he has fetish for those.|`|6U4sl15uaa	just to warn you its very messy but if your comfortable with it than go for it but i would recommend a condom its not unsafe just messy|`|zTKO7sWiaa	There isnt any harm in it. Do what feels best for YOU, if you are comfortable then go a head .  A shower afterwards will help|`|qjcTgXcZaa	It's not weird. It may be messy though.|`|F3LBgfvwaa	that's when it feels the best lol|`|2imXzBHbaa	just do it in the shower and you'll be fine.
qNMfaJ4Raa	I don't ever want him to hit me so I would never hit him. Violence doesn't solve anything.|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	What do you classify as perverted?|`|O36qjj7Oaa	No because my husband has never slapped me so i wouldn't do that to him.<br>  <br>  And if he said something perverted then i would say something perverted back to him lol.|`|83df363c0b39116bc273bca1cf432436aa	I really would not know as she never pushed, slapped, or anything<br>  abusive to me in the 22yrs we have been married and vice versa so<br>  it would come to a surprise to me so much so that I would probably<br>  just think why did she do that.|`|1da4a2d0455c0102329b9db0565c3a34aa	I'd really have to say something nasty but if I got slapped I guarantee it'd take alot of restraint not to lash back. Then I'd sleep at the finest hotel in town.  No need for that.|`|IgaW4g8Naa	i don't hit and i expect not to be hit.  you get one free pass and after that be ready to fight.|`|okjuXjrKaa	If he pissed me off enough...|`|WHvWcrfAaa	hmm yeah i did it couple of times while having sex...its makes him wild furious and...rest is on ur imagination...he he
PaZYsgGRaa	honestly i would do everything possible to figure out who the hell that person is. he could be cheating, i am married and lord if that happened to me i would be soooo angry at him because he cannot keep a secret like that, this is a big deal. marriage is when you stop playing games like high-schoolers. this is what i would do: first figure out who that is, second confront him about the problem and tell him he has to be more honest, third if he's cheating leave him|`|O36qjj7Oaa	30 minutes to 4 hrs everyday yea i would say he is cheating or about to.<br>  <br>  Are you sure its a girl from his work?|`|831e735ba92bb0dfd3b16be0d4995ccfaa	Why don't you cool your heels until you have all the facts. In the first place you gave him no chance to defend himself, you only accused. <br>        How long have you been married ? how many kids are there ? how long has this been going on. Is this the reason, the way your acting, the reason he's looking outside the marriage for companionship ? Your ready to hang the guy and you know nothing of what is going on.|`|253749a8c740b2b9ceb438a7f88d0d44aa	Yes, something is going on and if it's not, it's close. There is no reason why he would need to talk to another woman for that long every day. You don't have to go to his job to confront her, go to her house, but if he won't tell you the truth, I'd find someone who would.|`|ncWV2FwLaa	ARE YOU SURE IT ISN'T PORN CALLS?DID U CALL THE NUMBER.IF SO THAT YOU INOW IT IS HER,THEN YES GO TO HIS/HER WORK AND ASK HER WHO THE HELL SHE THINKS SHE IS CALLING YOUR HUSBAND ,ALL THE TIME NOT TO MENTION AT NIGHT.TELL HER TO GET HER OWN MAN.|`|zu10q3Qyaa	Why does your husband think it's ok to be friends with another woman?  He is married, what part of that doesn't he understand.  If I were you I'd tell him to make a choice because he can't have you both.|`|yhEDUN6qaa	Call her from his phone and ask her yourself. If your suspicions are true, ditch that a$shole. If your wrong, well you'll be pretty embarrassed.|`|AYnoqVhlaa	Funny thing. My ex did the same thing and as soon as I filed for divorce he basically moved in with her. Why do men think women are too dumb to figure it out. I wouldn't even question it. In my experience cheating is cheating whether it is emotional or a full blown affair. It all hurts the same. I would pack my bags and run. Good luck|`|6rHemG23aa	I've learned over the years that women's intuition is almost always right. Follow your gut feeling and see where it leads you. I would most definitly say yes he is cheating, doesnt mean he has had sex with her but its close to it happening. Don't put up with it. You deserve WAY better!|`|TNSfIjpyaa	You could be right....but then again you could be wrong. Try calling her more, if she answers ask if she knows Mr.(Your Last Name). Pretend you are just trying to find his contact info. If she doesn't know him, the chances of him cheating are much lower.<br>  <br>  Good Luck, I hope this ends up in your favor.|`|kTUL01tfaa	Yes sorry, I would say cheating, or he is about to, before you leave him--confront her, don't just let them get away with it.<br>  tell her you'll see her in court, put a scare into her.|`|har2oJHMaa	If he's hiding a female "friend" from you and talking to her for hours at a time, doesn't matter if they're having sex or not, it's cheating.|`|O4qO8aoLaa	Since he is getting mad because you asked him then that pretty much settles it.  He has something with her.  Might not be a full affair...YET.   So far he is just talking to her.  Tell him it makes you uncomfortable and ask him to stop talking to her.  Tell him if he doesnt you are leaving him.  Simple as that.  Its not appropriate for men to talk to women for hours at a time.  Vice versa too.  Those kinds of relationships should have been left behind when you married each other.  "Forsake all others"...remind him its on the vows he said.
DsNEpN95aa	Maybe you should have more friends that are girls. Talk to you guys friend. Don't all all into it, but just touch off on the topic w/ ur friends and stuff. I think that it should come naturally, and you just gotta get your confidence up. Hey, like you said, you're a good looking and strong guy so act one. <br>  <br>  Hope my comments helped!|`|AA10495394	Just say positive things about yourself and practice talking to women in the mirror and then once you get comfortable with that then try it with a lady friend.|`|bbm3UWfLaa	u don't have a girlfriend cause u play Pokemon.|`|VigZs9nxaa	haha.

8M4WZ8x5aa	Okay first of all,No girl likes to be told the truth about herself to her face!<br>  <br>   As for my advise to you, I think that you should just drop it. Stop trying to talk to her about the incident. I mean, if she's gonna be acting all immature about this then let her. Keep talking to her as your friend. When the time comes, ask her BUT NOT NOW! let her cool off. Apperently it really hurt her that you said that.|`|9220e99cf581203dda5db0c56616ac40aa	she thinks you're annoying, because instead of working on your own life, you use her as your life support.  she doesn't think you're a man.  <br>  <br>  what should you do?  get a life.  this isn't an insult.  go play some sports.  learn to draw, play an instrument, get better at public speaking, flirt with other girls, everything EXCEPT what you're doing right now.<br>  <br>  She will automatically come to you if you show (and don't fake it) that you can live your life perfectly without her in it.<br>  <br>  Just remember this analogy.

Since friends tell friends basically everything, her friend probably told her. Tell her that you didn't know her back then, and now that you do, you really like her and you're afraid of losing her. Ask if you did anything wrong, and be really humble. She probably doesn't want to get hurt by you. That friend that asked you if you liked her was probably one of those that was going to ask if you would go out on a date with that girl, since she was most likely afraid to ask you herself. It could have been basically like turning her down without meaning to.|`|K2UspSHAaa	There's an easy way to figure out one and for all. If you  have her cell  or myspace just text or write her and tell her where you stand...and ask if she would like to hang out... If she still gives you the run around. Move on.|`|Ytgo2L9Haa	Just ask her.  It will bring you closer together if she still likes you.  If she doesn't then at least you can move on.|`|Z0PqY7soaa	never say that to a girl again :-( <br>  that was mean!|`|FbdKXc5Qaa	Honestly i would just write her on myspace or something and just be straight with her. tell her how you feel and that your sorry for saying what you said. tell her you were confused and didnt know what to say when her friend asked you that but that you really do like her. and then leave it. open the door and let her walk through it. <br>  <br>  You can lead a horse to water but you cant make him drink!
OtCBPTzFaa	What did the email say? That is the first thing. If the email said that he had fun with you and that he wants to hang out with you still then you are okay. But if he says that he had fun and that was really it. It could go either way. Are you friends with his best friend who is a girl? Maybe you should get to know her and that will bring you closer to him. I know that this is really hard to understand. I am 17 it is still hard to understand. Don't that one person control your life. Like I did. There are so many other great guys out there waiting for you. If you need to talk to me more you can and I will listen. Good Luck!
D20ue82Iaa	Promise rings are really special.  Especially if you're wanting to wait a little bit before popping the question.  When my boyfriend gave me mine, it was one of the most special moments of my entire life, and it's been two years since then and I'm still wearing it :)  I would absolutely give her one!  And they come in all styles and sizes, honestly.  They're normally no bigger than a quarter karat total.  My mom's in fact, just had diamond chips in it.  However, I would get something different than what you're planning on getting her for her engagement ring.  <br>  <br>  BUT.  If you're going to ask her to marry you some day and tell her you'll give her an engagement ring later, then you might want to just give her the engagement ring now (if you think she's ready for that), and ask if a long engagement is okay with her.<br>  <br>  Btw, you have AWESOME taste in engagement rings.  The one you posted is extremely classy.  Way to go!!  <br>  <br>  I hope all goes well and congratulations!|`|BUpcsIGfaa	aww this is the nicest question :p<br>  shes a lucky girl.  how old are you?<br>  if your under 20 i would say give her a commitment ring then the actual ring in a year or 2, if older go for it, her parents obviously approve and the love is clearly there between you.<br>  good luck !!|`|qlNfbBMvaa	If your old enough to support your future wife and any future kids, meaning you have th financial stability, then i would say what the hell are you waiting for? but if that's not the case, then i would say tha a promise ring is a bit redundant, given that you love her and all|`|UIRQ6hjPaa	holy cow dude, 8.6k!!!|`|YhsCmwuwaa	That sounds like a good plan. A promise ring tells her that you are committed, but not ready to go through with the actual ceremony yet. I think you should get her something simple as a promise ring (even as simple as just a gold or silver ring) so that she will have something so much more beautiful to look forward to!<br>  Remember that love, words and actions are the most important things, not material things!<br>  I wish you all the luck in the world :)|`|KHtrHhKFaa	first of all , what a beautiful ring ..! yu can marry mee for that aha .. but seriously , i am probably way younger than yu but i know that asking her to be yur wife is so special and she would say how she feels, so if she says no its probably coz its early , but i think she would say yes .. congratulations and i think yu should go for it .. hope i helped , gud luck for the future x|`|tGh65rBgaa	AWWWWWW!!!!! thats so sweet :*] you soo should. she would understand|`|dHzBjHtfaa	that sounds like the perfect way... i would be delighted if a guy did that for me!! i would say stay really simple with the promise ring a small diamond or no diamond!, i say do it when you are ready not a minute sooner.. but let her know that is how you feel|`|AA10180137	if u know she's not scared of commitments then u should give it to her.

mL07N3IAaa	no you don't. guys just hurt you. it's not really worth it. your friends may  seem happy to you when they're around. but relationships aren't always happy.|`|29a2wm7Eaa	First of all, of course somebody likes you.  It may be somebody you wouldn't want to be with but trust me, somebody would do anythiing to be with you.  And nope, you don't need a boyfriend.  Being unhappy in a bad relationship is a thousand times worse than being single.|`|nLaMUS9Zaa	only you can decide that.i dont think you should have a boyfriend just for the sake of having one. if all your friends do have them and you dont that makes you unique. people usualy only get a boy/girl friend for a couple different reasons. 1: they found someone they really like and they want to be closer to them. 2: they dont want to be lonely. 3:they want to get laid. 4:they dont want to be the only one without one. i think #4 most fits you. in my opinion that isn't a good reason but its your life only you can decide how to live it........sorry that whole thing probaly wasn't very helpful but i tried xD. <-- has never had a girlfriend but wants one for reason #3 and a little of reason #2 ;p. so yeah im single *hint hint* =)|`|Px990WYDaa	yes you do.. because you said you want one. find a guy online. or just befriend a guy you want and then let it grow.|`|ba40b1dc2012e82e95de922c4b6b9847aa	The best things come to those who wait.<br>  so wait.<br>  you dont need one you feel like you need one.<br>  Life as a single girl is fun just stop looking.

ajzdsUldaa	Perhaps she is not rubbing her boyfriend in your face. You know her better than any of us, and as you say - she isn't a jerk, so she probably isn't doing this deliberately.<br>  <br>  When someone is very happy in their relationship they often talk about the person a lot or like to be publicly affectionate with that person to show how proud and happy they are. They do not often think that others might be upset by their actions, and I don't think anyone uses public displays of affection to deliberately hurt somebody. You'd have to be pretty malicious.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry to have to tell you this, as you probably won't like hearing it - but she's probably not deliberately rubbing him in your face, and you're noticing her actions more because you like her. Because she doesn't like you, she doesn't even think twice about the fact that kissing her new sweetie in front of you hurts you.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, you can't really ask her to be more considerate of your feelings, so you'll just have to deal with it.|`|VpunfjIUaa	chris brown her!!!!|`|0ktcvglRaa	Does she know that you like her? Maybe she's actually not rubbing her boyfriend in your face; maybe it just looks that way to you because you like her so much. Anyway, I highly doubt ANY girl would do this to get a guy to make a move on her after she and her boyfriend break up.<br>  <br>  I guess the only real reason I can think of is the whole "subliminal middle finger" thing you mentioned, but if she's not a jerk, then I don't see why she would be doing that.|`|aT7YJy3Kaa	MAYBE, ur concieted and shes not rubbing him in ur face at all. get over urself. i know many guys like youu, u think the everything everyone does is bc of youu.<br>  <br>  get over urself.|`|rz6ePHPXaa	She could just be kinda pissed off because you had your chance when she broke up with her first b/f and you didn't make your move. She might just be saying "look what you're missing out on because you don't have the balls to just make your move." Be confident and assertive. Know what you want and want it more than anyone else.

I don't remember the last time that being shy made someone dislike someone else. Besides, you have been gone, it doesn't mean you can't re-adjust to the life you had before you were home-schooled.

lNlL0Ag2aa	You never mentioned if you love him or not so that must mean that he doesn't know it either. When a guy continues pursuing a girl knowing that he receives no reward in return, then he'll give up and chase after another.<br>  <br>  This could be good for you if you weren't interested in him and you were annoyed by him, or this could be tragic if you were in love with him because this is definitely one big mistake of your life.
0ktcvglRaa	You're going to have to make a choice. If you simply cannot live with the fact that he has so much history, forget about him and move on.

If you're not ready, make a commitment to yourself to stop at a certain level - kissing, groping, fingering, oral, whatever.  It might help to make a promise to a close friend to stop at that level.  That way, you'll be more likely to hold yourself back from doing something regrettable in the heat of the moment.<br>  <br>  And just remember, communication is the key to a good relationship.  Tell him you've never been kissed, that you're nervous, and that you don't want him to press you to do more than you're ready for.<br>  <br>  You should also have a serious talk with your bff and figure out what might happen to your friendship if you pursue this boy.<br>  <br>  Good luck.  Remember not to ditch your friends for your boyfriend, and maintain good communication with your bf and bff. :)|`|DtBx851Maa	You should NOT date someone who has had a shaky history with a bff.

ZVruZGizaa	What does my body language tell my interviewer?<br>  Page 1 of 1<br>  <br>  It begins even before you say your first word. They’ll be sizing you up as you walk across the room to shake hands. Be conscious of how you look and what you’re doing, and try not to overlook the verbal and non-verbal signals you’re sending out in the rush to parade your carefully prepared answers before them. <br>  <br>  Pace yourself <br>  Speak deliberately more slowly than you would normally. There’s a trick here. You’ll be revved up as you go in, so you will naturally speak more quickly than normal. If you concentrate on pronouncing your words individually, you’ll actually be speaking at a normal speed. <br>  <br>  Think of good speakers you’ve experienced throughout your education. You’ll remember the ones who were more focused and engaging. That’s not to say they were the funniest or loudest or most entertaining. But they were almost certainly the most animated. Focus. You’re not here to entertain – so leave the jokes at the door – but you are here to look like you want the job. Concentrate on that and let your commitment and energy shine through. <br>  <br>  Non-verbal signals <br>  A firm but not crushing handshake is the one to go for. The wet fish technique is a guaranteed turn off. Also, try to ensure your hands are dry and warm – as natural as possible. If you tend to perspire under stress, try to run your hands under cold water before going in and if stress makes your skin cold, do the opposite. <br>  <br>  Don’t slouch in your chair, whether in reception or the interview room. Slouching says “I don’t care” and should be reserved for lazy Sundays on the sofa. Walk and sit up straight. If you’re worried about your posture, sit naturally in front of a mirror at home and see how you look. Practice sitting in a more vertical position and make a mental note of how it feels, so you can replicate it in the interview. <br>  <br>  Always look the questioner in the eye, but not in a way that could have you sectioned. Be confident, and don’t stare past your questioner or at the floor. Avoid glancing nervously around the room as this is the classic sign of someone with something to hide. If there is more than one interviewer, make sure you look at each of them when answering questions, and keep your eyes on their face, not straying to other parts of their body (if you know what I mean!). <br>  <br>  To find out what to do with your hands, watch yourself in a mirror of the office window when you’re on the phone. You’ll use some of the same gestures when you’re talking. It’s fine to gesture with your hands, but don’t overdo it so you look like you’re directing traffic. <br>  <br>  Don’t fidget and don’t play around with your hair, pen, nails, chair, jiggle your knees, tap your leg or anything else. It drives people crazy and will distract them from what you’re saying. <br>  <br>  Be aware of how you are sitting, moving and the general impression you’re giving out. So smile occasionally; it will make you all feel better.<br>  <br>  What should I wear to my job interview?<br>  Page 1 of 1<br>  <br>  Part of preparing for a job interview is making sure you are going to come across as a good addition to their company. Appearances shouldn’t matter, but the plain fact is that you are often judged before you’ve even uttered a word.<br>  <br>  Direct approaches (specifically phoning to check the dress code) or indirect approaches (standing outside the office a few days before your interview to check the people coming and going) are both valid ways of determining the general rules. <br>  <br>  Aim to dress one level up from what you would expect to be wearing if you got the job. It hints at your desire to progress and succeed within their company. If in doubt, always go for a classic plain business suit. Both male and female versions come in all shapes and sizes and can be picked up relatively cheaply. Combined with a clean shirt and preferably a tie, you’re unlikely to feel out of place. <br>  <br>  Essentially, if you feel comfortably, you’ll act comfortably which is vital in a pressure interview situation. <br>  <br>  Dressing the part is never something that will get you the job, regardless of how clean your shirt or shiny your shoes. However, it could put the employer off if you fail to follow some basic rules: <br>  <br>  ? Not too casual - If you get the vibe that casual is OK then stay on the smart side of casual. Ripped jeans, threadbare t-shirts and scruffy trainers should all be left at home. A smart pair of jeans and an open necked shirt is the bare minimum that is expected. <br>  <br>  ? No headwear – Under no circumstances wear a cap, beanie or hoodie to an interview – you’ll look like you’ve got something to hide. There are obvious religious and medical exceptions to this rule. <br>  <br>  ? Get the right fit – If you’ve had to borrow an ill-fitting suit for an interview, or just generally like to wear your clothes a little too loose or tight, try and find something a little more regular. <br>  <br>  ? No flashing – Although it may work in certain industries, cleavage and midriffs should be|`|VjmTK6uZaa	Just act like you know what your doing and sound a bit formal,  don't talk like they are your friend.  Talk formally but not british.  Also have self confidence, dont tell them your nervous.|`|ewc4AubYaa	For give the humor, but the first thing that I thought was...<br>  I'm the employer, I see you walk in...'Ah, a complection that needs some color..good'. Then I'd look at your referances/qualifications...I'd think, 'perfect'. She can answer the phone, then she'll get initiated (tanned), then when some one phones, she can honestly praise and recommend my glorious and life changing service!<br>  You'll be fine. Money is money, a very precious commodity right now. <br>  Good Luck.|`|Z96XbROJaa	Treat it like any other job interview. The tanning industry is fun, but they still would like someone professional. <br>  <br>  Are you going to be strictly a receptionist or will you double as a sales person? <br>  <br>  Either way, arrive on-time (meaning at least 5-10 minutes early), be courteous, and be yourself. Make sure you look neat and polished, meaning everything from your hair to your clothes to your shoes. Employers are looking for someone who can not only work hard, but can also look the part. <br>  <br>  During the interview, pace yourself! Don't get flustered, you'll end up talking too fast or stumbling on your words. RELAX! Just go with the flow and connect with the interviewer (don't be a stone that just answers questions.) <br>  <br>  Make sure to show that you are outgoing and not afraid to jump in and help someone, especially if your going to be sales! <br>  <br>  Most importantly, be yourself and relax. Remember to smile and be yourself!|`|0884ff2a0f28bad739166da0f1176c3baa	Be polite with a hint of a smile through your (outwardly) clear, relaxed formal answers from your position on the provided chair where you should sit comfortably straight with your hands folded, or slightly apart for the odd gesture, on your lap.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|pFgNqvBKaa	dress casual nice, not too nice and not sloppy. sound polite, show confidence b/c that's what most people look for rather than the ones that are good in that field. make and keep eye contact but not enough to freak them out. don't be nervous. good luck|`|nnYW2jVYaa	remember to be yourself, wear clothes that look professional, act,responsible and act like you would give anything for the job. <br>  <br>    hope it all works out|`|Z3wmdatPaa	whys this in singles and dating?

Offer to walk them to class, try and make plans to hang out and, above all, initiate the conversation between you two and be assertive when letting her know you like her. You can come off friendly, as in a good dating option, or friendly as just a friend who they feel is the equivalent of a brother and not a dating option at all.|`|cOBk3NxQaa	You're pretty cool. Don't sweat the girlfriend thing. Many people dont date right away so you're not alone.

I'm sure she will come eventually :)|`|1TSMdgG1aa	Don't worry about it, I didn't have a boyfriend until after I graduated high school.  Relationships come at different times for different people.  It doesn't mean that there's something wrong with you or anything, it simply means that right now isn't your time.  <br>  <br>  I think you should keep working on coming out of your shell.  Discover who you are, what you want for your life, and enjoy the journey.  You have your whole life ahead of you, and believe me, there's a lot more to life than a relationship.  <br>  <br>  So enjoy your life right now.

What many people mean when they say "nice" is that you are not assertive. Girls aren't mind readers. In addition, they generally will wait for a guy to make the first move.

N7gOE1btaa	It sounds as though the two of you have moved too quickly.  The moving in together part despite not having a solid relationship was a mistake.  The fact that he tried to cheat should be clear enough signal for you that the relationship is broken.  The fact that you break up frequently should also be a sign.  If you refuse to leave him, then you need to find out why it is he reacts to you by breaking up with you.  You also need to figure out why he doesn't want a relationship status and why he agreed to move in with you if he didn't want that.  But honestly, despite the fact that I always try to advise for people to stay together, I think in this case from what you are telling me, its not a good idea.  Sorry

I don't understand why your husband would have any other reason to suggest having a surrogate carry your child. Pregnancy is the easiest part of the whole parenting scenario. At the end of the surrogate's pregnancy, the baby is still going to be you and your husband's responsibility from that point on and you will have to raise the child. You'll regret having kids, no matter how you get them here, if you truly do not want them. Don't do this just to please your husband. This is definitely a subject you and your husband should have discussed and decided about before you got married. Perhaps you two should go to counseling and discuss this. GOOD LUCK.
F0sJR0jbaa	Get condoms with spermacidal lube on them.  trojan makes them.  condoms are very effective if used properly.

Its good for you to be scared of getting pregnant because having a child is the most life changing expensive thing you will do in your life and you should save it for when youre ready.. do your research and educate yourself on the proper ways to have sex.. be responsible.. if you're really wanting to have sex you should maybe get on birth control and he should always use a condom.. they are both 99% effect (when used correctly!) and therefore you are unlikely to become pregnant.. please get all the info before you start experimenting though!  Your doctor can talk to you about birth control!

Or the person that has a crush can try to get to know the other person better and better and try to become real good friends then finally see the right time to make the moves and make all the RIGHT moves.

N7gOE1btaa	I tend to think you should definately room with the guy.  I have several reasons for this:<br>  1) if you date this girl, it will get ackward if you break up<br>  2) if you date this girl, it will be weird for the other girl<br>  3) if you date someone else, then your gf may not like you living with two girls<br>  4) you just might altogether feel more comfortable with the guy so you can be yourself all of the time
cezaZQQsaa	Most men around this age tend to lose interest in their wives when they are going through a mid-life crisis. Truthfully, I don't think it's you. When my dad was about this age, he never cheated on my mom, but he began to talk openly with me (I am his son) about how much he wanted to be with other women (sexually), or how much he wished he would have stayed with a previous girlfriend he had before he married my mom. Yes, this is a little unsual for a father and son to talk about, but it's just something I observed from him. I think men just frequently go off in search of something else after being in a marriage for so long, regardless of the fact that his wife treats him wonderfully, does everything right, is beautiful, etc. It's very selfish, actually, but I believe that this kind behavior is common among most men who are going through a mid-life crisis. You have every right to be worried because this is your marriage at stake. I would definetly recommend going to marriage counseling, as this is what my parents did and they are still married today 10 years later. Hope my advice helped :)|`|CnywgeNDaa	Not every man does it, but some do. What you can do to help is try to spice things up a little bit. See what he's interested in now and try to keep an open mind. Act like you've just started dating again and try to do things he wants. Spice up your sex life by trying new things. Put on something super sexy and tease him or do something new. :) <br>  I hope the best for you! :)|`|t0rOQ5FWaa	I never look at other women i only have eyes for my sweet sweet baby<br>  <br>  Add'; of course i had to say that with her close by lol|`|kTUL01tfaa	he is distancing himself emotionally before he cheats, this happened in my marriage.|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	Every man does not cheat on thier wives during a mid-life crisis.|`|iblT1HJpaa	"His Needs - Her Needs" by Willard Harley<br>  <br>  marriagebuilders.com<br>  (go here!)|`|874EAxkfaa	first thing ,look in a mirror,make honest assessment. <br>  how much time is he putting in on the job? a wandering eye, yeah!<br>  if you want to keep this marriage,you both need to see a marriage counselor.|`|WIurOBbDaa	I'm 19 so I haven't exactly expierenced that sort of thing yet...|`|13d4bd226d0dce7fe19e7693dc8cfed9aa	maybe you should change the brand of breakfest cereral your eating|`|naequcqlaa	I would NOT say a man of 37 is in a "mid life crisis"!  He's far too young for that.  He may feel a need of being "recognized" or "accepted" because of his lack of low self esteem & this is a way of making him feel attractive to others.  Have you talked about anything of what you've noticed that's going on, or that you'd love for him to have more interest in you sexually?  You could mention you've noticed how he seems to be looking at women differently lately & this hurts your feelings.  Or have you tried to go out of your way to make yourself more attractive sexually especially around bed time?  I can well imagine how you feel, especially since his lack of "romance" twds. you is so noticeable.  Maybe bring up to him in a nice way or a kidding way of how can you dress that he'd be interested in seeing you do or wear.  Get out some sexy high heels, a sexy nite gown, dim the lites & lite some candles one nite & see what his reaction to that might be.  If he's doing this in front of you, I really don't feel he's headed for an affair tho.  Just a "moral type thing" instead.  See if you can have a talk to him tho...Best to you...:)
d7jd7GYjaa	Honestly the reason may be that they get pissed that you hang out with the guys they like. They get jealous, so in order to make themselves feel better they push you down by calling you a sl*t. Then you might not want to hang out with the guys.|`|Bo4JjEASaa	girls just overreact to such silly things like that. Nobody has the right to call u a s*ut because u have had the same boyfriend for three years and you don't mess around with the other guys so it's really none of there Business

My man is the perfect definition of beauty.  He asked me to marry him after 3 weeks of "knowing" him and meeting him.  Because, he is me and I am him, we "know" each other.  We are soulmates.

She might've been in a previous relationship where some idiot broke her heart-and now she is always afriad of it happening again. You might not have wanted to cause harm, but to her you may be joking, or it could be some kind of dare. Try to prove to her that you're worthy! Do some things to show that she has nothing to fear, and that you can be trusted.|`|Pl4MNdxOaa	She likes you! She's just afraid of being rejected. If you sAid kind of she most likely only said it so she could make herself feel better if you didn't end up asking her out. I mean how awkward would it be if you said "I kindof like you" and she said "I REALLY like you!!" that was probably what she was thinking. Just go for it!

Also when a girl says "i'm unsure how I feel," it could be a nice way of saying NO... i mean thats what i said to a guy once lol . Even though it doesn't work out you should still be friends no matter what, maybe when she gets to know you better it might work out.

My boyfriend liked me for a while. He would talk about me to people for a month. He was too afraid to talk to me. But finally after a month he grew the balls to talk to me. I was very nervous, I knew he had been talking about me. I Turned him down the first two times. I felt bad because I liked him too. Lucky for me he really liked me and gave me another shot. I said yes. After a month of talking we started dating. I'm so glad I said yes. I know some girls like me are nervous. we don't want to get hurt. Some girls like some of my friends want to make sure the guy likes her, does not want her just for sex. Girls want to feel special and important. Give her time and make sure she knows you like her and don't just want sex. Hope that helps. The most important thing is be confident in yourself. Confidence is the best thing a guy can have.
lNlL0Ag2aa	You'll never know from just spectating, just approach him and ask him that you want to spend some time to get to know more about him. It won't seem weird in his point of view no matter how weird it may look from yours, especially if you say it straightforward.

I understand that you can't live on child support but there are ways around this. I'm a single mother who works (temporarily on short term disability) and starting a business of my own. The simple fact of the matter is that nothing comes easy. There are always going to be sacrifice's. You have to give to get. You don't want to work so the other option is to deal with it. Have you ever thought that maybe he does what he does because you give him the power? You're asking a question and defining the answer that you WANT to get at the same time, you can't do that. Yes, people are going to look at this paragraph and an outsider would without question consider you weak, lazy and insecure. Only you know when enough is enough. If a bear was caught in a trap he'd bite his paw off to get away. That's the same principle here. When enough is enough, you'll devise a plot to get away.<br>  That's all I have to say.|`|hwNVpjKmaa	LEAVE! Between your job and child support, you will make it.

sgfGvjs0aa	who knows, if you really like her not just because of her looks but because you really want to get to know her, then this could turn into something great. But you have to be sure that she's mature enough and feels the same way.

GmtoGQ24aa	If you want to spend some alone time with someone you like then go ahead and ask him up face to face. I'm not a big basketball person but if I  were you, I would just go up to him and say that you and him should go play some basketball, like you would say it to a friend. <br>  One thing I've noticed is that the longer you wait, the more you second-guess doing it, and then when you DO do it, its easier to tell that you're nervous, and there for easier to guess that you like him. If you want to hang out then just ask him! But don't be too up front about it, try to morph a conversation into something to do with basketball and then ask him if he want to go to the YMCA with you. Its actually a lot easier than it sounds, and who knows? Maybe he likes you a lot too, and is glad that you're making the first move!|`|7BcBwW6Xaa	just facebook or text him.

uJbbtE9Laa	You should ask him something about the class. Ask him about an assignment or homework even if you know the answer. That way you will have opened up the conversation without being awkward. From there you could ask if he likes the class or teacher or about any other classes he may be taking. Be relaxed and ask questions relating to the class first, then you will be able to open it up for more conversations in the future about other things.|`|nMMUYlduaa	U need to b.

qv3W0MDJaa	Be optimistic!<br>  <br>  I think your chances are good,great even (i'm psychic)<br>  And if she rejects you, she is quitting her job and like you said, you may never have to see her again.

gXR7J785aa	Nah, i dont think so. They say 'opposites attract', right?<br>  Maybe you could be hanging out too much with her, or she's just really busy lately and doesn't have time for you. I know it sounds rough, but it happens.<br>  Just sit down with her and ask her what's up, why she needs space. If she truly does love you, then nothing will be wrong.<br>  Hoping for the best.

I mean, he can't be a total assface, but he can't be metrosexual, either...
uvAzxEFUaa	I think you should try to talk to her. Girls love it when guys come up to them and start a conversation. It doesn't really matter if she likes you now or not. She may have gotten over you but if you initiate a conversation, you'll be on her mind for a while. She'll probably wonder why you decided to speak to her then she'll probably think about how she felt about you back in 8th grade and rethink her feelings. Girls get pretty emotional and worked up over the little things. I think you definitely have a chance with her. :)|`|hKd21emDaa	you should probably arrange a get together and invite a lot of people, including her. That way, there will be a mix of both boys and girls, and it will be easy to socialize with her.
XYBCQz8Naa	my friends do that, its a guy thing. he should know there just messing with him. the only reason it would bother him is if hes uncomfortable with the relationship, getting teased by your friends isnt a big thing for guys.|`|27fe1e3ae697035fd2660cec751b7997aa	yea! thats really bad... they are really sucky a$$ friends.... when a person is in a relationship with someone having your friends support you is number 1 and if he doesnt have that then he might just fall and tumble. and it could cause for him to break up with you,.. somertimes the things friends say to a guy can really manipulate him and do some stupid things. make him feel secure nad let him know that just because his friends arent their for him, you are =)  wish you the best of luck.<br>  <br>  <br>  Answer mine???<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Aql6lSFDLfQ3JTZTUckbhojsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090306153258AAJkDuo">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|fzLnapcZaa	No its really not that wierd. it happens all the time to  me and alot of my friends... and usaly its not a bad tease its just a to annoy them tease|`|2eFIzND0aa	yes but ignore it their just some jerk off.
yzxDvRzUaa	i think you should still go to dinner. once he meets you in person he might just get over that you are older than he is, just give it a chance
2bb1214a282e2cfeed0adeb41e0bcf6eaa	tell her exactly how you feel. it would probably be a good idea to stop anything 'happening' until she is sure of what she wants, as it will only make things more complicated. give her a bit of time to think about what she wants, but dont let her mess you around and take forever to decide.<br>  just tell her that you want to be with her, and you should just act like normal friends until she knows what it is that she wants. if you carry on doing stuff and are not together then you will end up getting hurt.
2wZhVA8faa	Aw, dude it really sucks when this kind of stuff happens because people get confused and don't know how to react... If I was you I would just sit down with her and have a serious talk about it. Tell her how much you care about her and explain to her how you feel like she's acting different. Hopefully she will realize how much you love her and maybe she'll change her ways a little bit... Good luck.
2wZhVA8faa	Well, that's always a tough one... I mean I have some slutty friends that i hang out with sometimes but I've never cheated on my boyfriend... and we've been together for a year a four months... so if you trust her and believe when she says she will love you and will never cheat on you then just believe her... if not then she's not the right girl for ya... =/<br>  <br>  good luckk.|`|Hek7MUNYaa	your over reacting dude...|`|6Y9zWhvHaa	tell her how you feel. let her know how much you love her. you should trust her.|`|8g2VECDwaa	if she duz cheat on you better now rather than later so you can move on instead of finding out in years to come that she a cheat, just let her get on with it and you soon find out, and if she dusnt great, if she duz then find a nice girl who is faithfull, xxxx|`|WyWHvUXJaa	yes she will cheat on you. But its no big deal. All girls do that and all guys!   Think of it positively - she may pick up some great tips that she can use on you.   And dont worry - it doesnt mean she doesnt love you. its just a thing young girls always do!|`|Zca1PGERaa	none whatsoever in fact this friends behaviour probably puts your girlfriend off acting like that. I know myself have a few friends who are all over guys and i just think they look pathetic and desperate and needy. i tell them too.|`|XBYiHaWIaa	She's in South Beach of course she's cheating.|`|ilnFjr9Haa	I had the same situation, i confronted my girlfriend when she came back but she said she didn't as much as i doubted her deep down i trusted her and the way she is when she does something like goes to a party with some friends and don't tell me about it... makes her ring me out of guilt, so i think if my gf cheated on me i would be 75% sure about it... if i cheated on her i know my guilt would make me confess she says the same, but seriously man, you HAVE to give them the chance to prove themselves or you will never know.<br>  <br>  Good luck mate, hope it works out.|`|bMmV6R2Jaa	you have some lack of trust issues and maybe expect too much. What is cheating> your inability to control the fun she has and with whom?<br>   Thats not cheating. Your jealous need to grow up and reevaluate why your hanging on what she does when you should be glad shes having a nice vacation. GROW UP!  and if you cant ur not ready for a relationship!<br>  you dont own her, she can do as she pleases. .until she says I DO. she dont!|`|w5oh9NDfaa	I don't know her well enough to tell you that she'll stay faithful to you. Just because her friend likes to get around doesn't make your girlfriend one, you're dating her. If she cheats then it wasn't meant to be, not all girls are the same.|`|GXhSvW2daa	mate get your gf out of there, friends can change a person in a sec and she will Do anything  and i mean it and its not because she doesnt love you, friends can get people to do anything, they mess with your mind.|`|tZjdns5Faa	my friend... sorry to tell you this but think of it this way, picture yourself in south beach with a friend of yours and your in a hot tub full of beautifull slutty girls  your girlfriend will never find out.. what would you do lol
AA11150213	Keep your head up.<br>  I know it hurts because your didn't see it coming, and to be honest he didn't really give you a good reason for ending the relationship. <br>  <br>  But that's okay, for now you should spend sometime on your own the last thing you need is some rebound guy. Give yourself a bit of time before you jump back into the dating world, especially if you aren't over you ex boyfriend.<br>  <br>  Right now you should try doing things with friends and the people you love. Try doing activities that you like. Whether you like to sing, write poetry, dance, play soccer, roller blade, paint..etc do whatever you are interested in it will help you get your mind off things and help you express your feeling. Just avoid locking yourself up in your room and forcing yourself to be sad and think about everything.<br>  <br>  In time you'll be able to move on, you deserve better and you'll find some who appreciates you soon enough
dmxkyXC1aa	Why don't you take a visit down to San Diego, it is a beauriful city and I'm sure he wioll be pleased with that Idea. They have many fabulous restaurants in downtown and amazing hotels. It is a charming city, with great weather, and extremely friendly people! You can go for a walk by the bay and go for ice cream! :) Have fun!|`|wHgBnMipaa	I hear a great place to eat would be Phood on Main.  As far as activities go, try the American Eagle Winery at Canyon Crest.  You can make your own wine and just take in the scenic view.  Use MapQuest to find both of these places if you aren't sure where they are.|`|Wc96SRkpaa	surprise him by going somewhere he's always wanted to go or a location that means a lot to him. maybe a place that isnt so cliche to make it special. dont go out for breakfast, make breakfast. maybe tent out somewhere? something different.
4wH3Hvcxaa	Sadly she does not like you !i|`|AA12392755	She is doing this because she knows it is stupid to try to have a relationship via IM.

uvAzxEFUaa	I think it's time for you two to move on. If you're not completely happy in your relationship and would rather spend more time with your friend then your relationship has gone on for as long as it was supposed to. It'll be hard to move on and see new people (especially the first week or so) but later on you'll probably be glad that you moved on when you did :) I think you should also discuss breaking up calmly with your boyfriend to see if he's on the same page you are. Good luck :)|`|YjByj5UOaa	tell your boyfriend how you feel about him. and if he gets angry brake up with him. make sure you think very clearly about this situation. this is very hard. think who makes you feel good, who is nice think and you would find who is best for you|`|uLyBjMonaa	you said it yourself your happier with your friends maybe right now you should be single!<br>  <br>  PLEASE ANSWER NEED ADVICE ASAP!<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=ArDRDimNqoD_Y1y29FkwKM7sy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090309194505AABAn4V">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|bdmRHIaZaa	Girl, you are way to young to deal with this, if its meant to be you will get back with him.

Try going on break for a while. See other people. This usually works.|`|76Tbko40aa	Talk to him about it.<br>  Things dont get better unles you talk.<br>  Maybe its time to move on.|`|AA12392755	The right thing to do is forget about all the drama of "boyfriends/girlfriends" and concentrate on getting good grades in school.|`|syLCg7f3aa	Yes, break up with him. Sounds like the relationship deflated. So break up with him, and focus on the new guy that you have interest in. You said that you don't like your boyfriend as much as you used to, and that is a bad sign. When you have found the right person, you will always have some degree of butterflies and your feelings will grow- not lessen. You are 15 sweets, be young. Experiment, date a lot, and find exactly what you want. Don't settle. Don't waste your youth, it goes too fast. And don't you feel guilty. Take care of you & your heart, Good luck
8w3Nfenyaa	Ok, you two both seem like a really shy couple, <br>  <br>  now im gunna go ahead and assume your younger than me (17) <br>  <br>  1.Any girl who has been dating a guy for 3 months will 100% wanna kiss them maybe even make out. But youll move on to that..<br>  <br>  2.Overcomming doing it is really hard sometimes it can take up to 2 weeks to get the confidence, all you need to do is keep trying eventually at a good time youll be able to do it, then youll feel that it was easy.<br>  <br>  kissing will become something you do often.|`|AA11651312	Go at your own pace. Do not listen to what other people say about how fast or how slow you're going. You guys are the ones in the relationship so you both get to set the pace. You said you're both fine with it, so that's all that really matters. <br>  <br>  I think it's really admirable that you've waited, considering how fast teenagers move these days. It shows you're actually very mature. Will this be your first kiss? I think waiting makes it more special for her. When you do kiss her for the first time, make it memorable for her, cause I'm guessing it will most likely be her first kiss to. Do something romantic. Chances are, she's been dating you for three months, so she obviously likes you - and would want to kiss you. She wouldn't reject your kiss. But only kiss her if you feel like it's right. If you are not comfortable, thats a sign you're not ready...and that's OK!!!! <br>  <br>  Do not worry. Everyone is nervous before their first kiss. But then you learn afterwards, kissing is like an instinct. It comes naturally to you. Just read her body language, and see if she responds favorably - then go in for the kiss (if you're ready!). If she doesn't want to yet, that's fine - just wait til whenever she's ready. And when that moment comes - make her as relaxed as possible. Goodluck!!
qv3W0MDJaa	I predict this relationship won't last. You started dating on FRIDAY THE 13TH.|`|a9158ed922422742a841f62fbf1b64d6aa	I think she's just checking if you're ok with going so slow. A lot of girls are insecure because they may want to take things slow, but we also know that guys like to move faster, so I think she just wanted to check if you were fine with it.<br>  <br>  My friends say that about my boyfriend and me, so sometimes, I ask him how he feels about it, but he said it doesn't matter, as long as I'm with him...<br>  <br>  I think it's all good. If anything, ask her again how she feels and see if she wants you to make a move. =) Good luck!|`|rhvA4G4Paa	its a good thing. it means shes thinking about how you are as a person, trying to figure you out.<br>  <br>  i would just talk to her about everything. just be like , "yeah i am happy with you. and i dont care about what "that other couple" is doing, this is you and me, and well do whatever at our own pace."
e5GOHVWzaa	tell her that it's going to be okay and you will be there for her whenever she needs someone to talk to or lean on, say something like "thats what FRIENDS are for" or "dont worry you'll always have me as a FRIEND"|`|mCV8RHJMaa	You know I am always here for you, no questions asked.|`|y1LTfhEAaa	just offer her your shoulder and let her know that you will be there no matter what. but fair warning, sometimes us girls like to talk about our ex's alot... but remember whatever he did wrong you can learn from. don't try to make any sudden moves...

Lyrc2BWmaa	You should explain to her that a relationship is made up of a few main things. Love, trust, and honesty. Tell her how much you love her and that you may have hooked up with the girl but that your heart belongs to her and it didnt mean anything. Tell her that she can trust you not to do it againa nd that you will always love her and only her. Tell her how you told her the truth and ask her if it would have been better if you had lied to her about it. If she says lying would ahve been better, than shes not worth it. If she realizes that the truth was the right thing to say, tell her again how sorry you are.<br>  <br>  Now being able to tell her this will be the tricky part. Give her a few days, as hard as it will be. I would wait 2 or 3 before showing up to her house. This conversation needs to be person to person; so she knows that you mean everything 100% with all your heart.<br>  <br>  Best of luck<3|`|dlHg3r1Vaa	sorry, but the only way you can do that is to go through hell proving that you love her and you're sorry. I would have just plain went home and did it with her instead of some crazy girl at a party, i mean, cOME oN! you love ur gf but this girl?! wtf were you thinking?!|`|eSGBXFEjaa	Tell her you really care about her and that you want to do whatever it takes to get her back in your arms!

Give her time maybe she will realize that you made a mistake and take you back. And if she doesnt take you back you know that you lost someone important and know not to make that stupid mistake again..good luck :)|`|N8S9hp8Naa	well in my opinion, just keep trying, but dont get to annoying<br>  give her space.. but at the same time let her know you're still there.<br>  like call her but once a day, not 2938423 times. that would make everything worseee.<br>  best thing to do is give her timee.<br>  <br>  hope this helped(:|`|66Fhsm0vaa	apologize like crazy and be really sweet, like buy her roses and stuff. dont flirt with any girls at all but her. you might have to be patient though, b/c it could take a long time before she forgives you.|`|pdqJjvrwaa	doesnt matter how drunk you was. I'd never cheat and to be honest mate you dont deserve her.<br>  <br>  It really bugs me why people cheat. I believe the saying once a cheat always a cheat.|`|04fa28a6b99f16ba625a1c29229cd963aa	You're horrible. I hope she never takes you back, you don't deserve her.|`|31SFWKNvaa	Well first thing you have to learn to control your drinking. Alcohol does hinder your judgement. If you realise that and are willing to make an attempt to slow down or space out your drinking, it will help. You could tell her it was only because you were drunk. But I personally, You would have to do some serious talking. But it sounds like your kinda young, and if you learn from this mistake it will get better. Alot of women feel like this their man cheats that he dont care about them, But I know from personal experience I did things I shouldnt have I would black out, Well I changed that habit, and now I only have a few.<br>  good luck|`|7wdooasKaa	Wow... & I can't tell you how many other people have been in the same situation as you. Drinking screws up so many things and you should of been moderating your drinking more. You really owe her big time if you want her back and its clear that you really truly do care about her and you were just super drunk. The best thing to do is simply try your hardest to talk to her. Maybe she's not gonna listen right now but you really just need to continue trying to talk to her if she really means as much as you say she means to you|`|AA11296241	what you did was stupid. She is hurt. Leave her alone for a while. Send her flowers saying you are sorry and regret it yuo want her back. Please give you anotehr chance. Tell her she can take as long as she wants to get over this and when she is ready you will be right theer waiting. reassurance is what it will take.|`|6AV9XbjCaa	babe, tell her what happened exactly<br>  that it was a mistake and you were fucked up [not really an excuse, but still]<br>  and try and do whatever you can to let her know you love her and care ONLY for her<br>  if you really want her back, nothing will stop you<br>  good luck =]|`|3pnQ5zhWaa	aww at least you appologized to her<br>  nad told her in the first<br>  place must guys will just acted like itn ever happpend<br>  umm wait a while let her cool of then talk to her<br>  and apologizre<br>  i think everyone deserves a second chance|`|aYceYhfRaa	im a girl and the answer is live ur lifee haha idk im 11 i have a question 2 what should i do to not have p.e|`|YGPTg5hqaa	OMG<br>  WHO WOULD SUCH A THING??<br>  shiiittt<br>  <br>  ok<br>  ur girl is really pissed<br>  <br>  man<br>  if i were her i wouldve slaughtered u right there<br>  <br>  lol<br>  jkjk<br>  <br>  k<br>  shes really angry and let her chill dwn  <br>  prove her shes wrong and ur right ....in a good way<br>  <br>  good lukk|`|0q0bVJYaaa	Evidently, you don't really love her.|`|90c0071f6f1db8590c82485a0c5b352faa	Well well budy your asking the question to the wrong people.

My advice? Be completely humble and admit that it was your fault, that you feel so horrible and not yourself. Be truthful and do not exaggerate anything. Talk to her in person; telling her over the phone wasn't the smartest thing, because reading body language can also help someone forgive you, especially by looking into their eyes. Be romantic, do anything that you can for her without being stalkish-like, be there for her, and also know when to just back off and let her think.|`|hP4K40eiaa	Dude you messed up big time. You basically cheated on her. It sounds like that was never you intention but you let that girl kiss you and much more. you had every chance to turn around and walk away. Ya you were drunk but think about how you would feel if she did the same thing to you. She can't trust you and she feels like you chose some skank over her. And what makes it worse is that she didn't do anything to deserve it. You got to give her time to get over it. Let a week or so go by and then try to get lunch with her. Bring flowers, ya corny but she deserves something pretty. If she doesn't answer your calls you either have to keep trying or give up. In all fairness, why should she go back to you. Figure out why she should, cause when she does answer, she will ask that question.|`|oPRvq655aa	Seriously, I really don't think you will get her back, I'm sorry.<br>  <br>  I mean, what you did is far beyond bad, and I know you didn't mean to do it, but if I were in your girl's position, I would not want you back at all. <br>  <br>  Of course there's no harm in trying. You could maybe send her a gift or an apology card. But right now I think she needs some time to herself, and I can only imagine what kind of pain she is going through.<br>  <br>  I think you should just move on and maybe find someone else, or no one at all. Get on with your life already.<br>  You made your mistake, so learn from it and carry on your lesson to wherever you go in your life. That's all you can do right now.|`|qPrNjUjkaa	Well, first of all, you have a drinking problem. You should never get to the point of being "drunk". You have to learn to limit yourself. If you go to AA meetings or stop drinking, she may take an interest in you again. If nothing else is working, though it will hurt, you have to let her go. If she won't take you back, it's not meant to be. And some day, an amazing girl will come along. Remember, when one door closes, three doors open. If she won't take you back, take advantage of new experiences and opportunites. Good luck.|`|Op37pHd3aa	im sorry. if you loved your gf you would have drunk in a safe environment and wouldn't have cheated on her. you dont   deserve her.|`|f03edf3d3fe5d3e7c31416dd3871939aaa	you lost her<br>  she will not put up with a cheater
DcrI9zmkaa	Going to the school counselor is a good idea.  Talking about it will help you work through your feelings.<br>  <br>  Aside from that, you need to go live your life.  Instead of sitting at home thinking about your ex, get out and do things:  hang out with friends, find a new hobby, do volunteer work, or whatever strikes your fancy.  The key is to fill your mind with positive and productive thoughts rather than painful and depressing ones.

But I think they do this for a few reasons:<br>  <br>  1) To get the reaction. If someone whines or cries, that's what they want,<br>  2)Trying to impress friends. apparently being a jerk is impressive to some guys<br>  3)To impress girls. I don't see the logic in it, but I know for a fact that some do it for that reason<br>  4) They're insecure. they may seen so big and tough on the outside, but really they're depressed, or something is falling apart in their lives, and they need an outlet to take out the stress.<br>  <br>  These are the main reasons why they do this, hope I helped|`|V17liBvXaa	Guys and people in general act like that sometimes because they don't really know what they are saying..They dont know that sometimes it affects people in a bad way and it sometimes makes people sad and depressed.

I've known Muslim parents who are relaxed and cool about white boyfriends, I've known others (Algerian, actually) that have sent the sons round with knives with the intention of stabbing the poor guy.  I'm not kidding.  You know your father better than any of us.  If you think violence might be an issue, then your options are: tell him and hope nothing violent happens to yourself and your boyfriend, keep it to yourself, get a boyfriend of the right color or simply run away.  Not a great set of choices.  I hope your father isn't like this.|`|zVFZVrsAaa	Gently.|`|S4HUVnzkaa	You mean you have to be non white to be Muslim?<br>  I wasn't aware.|`|VfbsGjYSaa	I would talk it over with your boyfriend some before deciding that it is the right time for him to "meet the parents." Have you met his family yet?<br>  Also, consider telling your dad about him and asking him "Would you like to meet ____? It would mean a lot to me for you to get to know each other." Or something like that. If they both agree to meet each other and feel it is the right time, talk to both of them about what setting would be best. A family dinner? Going out to eat or at your parents' home? These are all things you can plan ahead of time so that it will go as smoothly as possible.|`|5qKjaq1Daa	question is would he convert into muslim?  is he serious enough to marry you?  first you should discuss that with your bf.  besides in the muslim religion you know it doesn't exist bf and gf only husband and wife, even though he is not too religious when it comes to his daughter, Cox you are a women, you know how he will react.<br>  So, ask him how would you feel if i have a white bf, if you that he over reacts, just tell him, i was joking.....|`|tdcUUA5Zaa	Ask your dad to come to dinner at your house, and have your boyfriend be there.

Because maybe if he loves you to the point of marriage, he'll consider converting. Sure your dad will be mad that you had a boyfriend, but he can't be mad forever. And if your boyfriend converted, i'm sure your dad will be happy about it.|`|hxDD9flkaa	Just be honest. If your father is understanding, religion should not be in the way of love.

UijixdJ4aa	It's pretty obvious you are both stressing out.  Being laid off, a young child, school responsibilities - you guys have your hands full.<br>  <br>  Please try to talk with him (when the baby is asleep or, better yet, with Grandma!) and see if you two can figure out a cheap way to de-stress.  Picnic at the park, nice hike, swimming, anything free or fairly free.  That and a couple of Pina Coladas may get you guys talking.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you both.|`|PBdPD748aa	this is where a lot of marriages seem to go wrong.<br>  bringing a child into this world is a choice you make as a couple. your marriage must always come first. you are on loan with your children until they are capable to get out of the 'nest' and build a life and family of their own. it will be you and your husband left. couples seem to forget about all the romance, intimacy and love in their relationship that brought them together in the first place. if people put their marriages first, families would be a lot more healthier and intact!|`|oeEsnwSMaa	talk to him|`|nk9m9PmUaa	Good job working on it.

a3c6c459cb76599b92b05d066bdb8e6aaa	my now Ex husband used to tell me he watched porn because it was a lot less work and he just can focus on himself and get it out of the way. he was very selfish. Personally i wouldnt worry so much about the porn and talk to him so you can get your communication back then the sex will come back and the porn will decrease. if you are feeling bad about your looks, go get a make over. hair nails wardrobe. do what makes you feel good. maybe wear something sexy around the house to get his attention??|`|4POGapREaa	I'm sorry.  It's hard to advise without knowing a few things so I have some questions.  Was he always kind of disinterested?  Are you his first relationship?  If he had other relationships, do you know how those were sexually?  I'm asking because my husband & I were active and then slowly less & less to where it was almost non-existent.  I would see porn here & there & wonder the same thing as you.  I'm not saying this to be a b*tch at ALL but I am more attractive than his ex's so I knew it wasn't that and it STILL caused me to feel gross & insecure.  I probably hammered him about this issue so many times before figuring it out.  He finally admitted that his past 2 long term relationships had broken up because of his lack of interest in sex in general & those girls just couldn't deal with it so they bailed.  So, I'm wondering if this is a pattern for him?  My husband has some performance anxiety issues & is only comfortable with no pressure on him at all like just masturbating.  Then there's the issue of pure laziness.  Believe it or not, we all hear about what horndogs guys are, but a lot of them just see it as work when they can have a quick release.  Also, is he taking any meds that would lower his drive?<br>  <br>  In any case, instead of personalizing this & getting angry, approach him with caution & sincerity because I made the mistake of being angry & it totally backfired, made the whole situation worse & more uncomfortable, and got me nowhere.  As it turns out, he was hoping I would be more sensitive to his "issue" and I was just like every other girl who treated him like sh!t & made him feel like a loser.  You should approach it more in the way of concern for your relationship in general instead of being like "I'm fat, right?  I'm ugly, right"?  You know what I mean.  Because men just shut down when we go off like that.|`|IvMPh09baa	he's watching it BECAUSE he's not having sex with you.<br>  <br>  Its one of those catch 22's.....<br>  <br>  have sex with the man, and the porn will decrease.|`|e5543e7d44e54e5a2ba736ec70b75019aa	I totally understand you. Every men always look at the porn on computer because they want to viewing different pussy look likely company own wife or girlfriend's vagina.<br>  <br>  Men has high prevert inside body.|`|1da4a2d0455c0102329b9db0565c3a34aa	I can't find any other answer to your question than simply getting up the nerve to talk to him about it and ask him yourself.  There is no good reason a man anywhere under 70 or so without health problems looks at porno for hours and doesn't bang his wife as often as he can.  I understand you not wanting to discuss it with him but if you've tried seducing him and he's not interested then you have no other choice.  If he's always defensive about it then only you can decide when you've had enough living with it.|`|k4mGOlwsaa	hey(redhead) NEWS FLASH men that have sex still watch porn! you need to talk to your husband plain and simple ive been threw this and it sucks and i know how ya feel about not wanting to face it but if you don't grab control of this situation now it will get out of hand and lead to worse off things just ask him why hes looking at it, and tell him how much it hurts you and that you don't like it i myself feel its in way cheating cause there looking at this for a reason, there could be alot of reasons hes looking even tho its not right, maybe you are fighting alot which can cause him not to want to have sex,maybe hes alot more kinky than you know and is to afraid to communicate with you about it, etc.... just talk it out  GOOD LUCK|`|zu10q3Qyaa	Sounds sad to me.  There isn't much of a marriage if he living in a fantasy world and neglecting you.  You need to confront him regardless of the answer.  If you don't confront him you'll be continuing on in this messed up thing that he's doing.  Someone said he's watching porn because he's not with you, sounds like that isn't the case when I read your question.  Sounds like he isn't living in reality.|`|rWwHjUsKaa	I know your situation too. I'm married and there was a time when I always looked at net porn and jacked off 7-8 times a day or as much as my body would let me before I got nausiated and felt like barfing. But my point is...like your husband it was hard for me to get hard from fooling around with my wife. but dont get me wrong, my wife is gorgeous and you probable are too , but u need to understand that he has a problem and probably needs some kind of help, or else get rid of the internet.|`|31ahiJabaa	Porn does that to men. Don't compare yourself to the women he watches, because they are unreal. They allow men to fantasize way beyond reality. <br>  And it becomes addictive. <br>  You don't need to be mad, let him know that you are the real thing, satisfaction guaranteed. <br>  Be attractive, be sexy. Good luck.|`|HE56Jra6aa	We all know that marriage isn't easy. You should confront him and then try watching it with him... It may help your marriage more than you think.<br>  Your not wanting Sex may lead to his discretion.|`|At8D5Xu2aa	That's typical but effed up.  Get counselling or get out.|`|1hDhmql4aa	Unfortunately there is no way to fix it without having verbal disagreements because he most likely enjoys it and won't want anyone to take it away from him or he doesn't think there is a problem!<br>  I'm in the same situation and I can tell you right now that this is a big problem.  You need to stop thinking that you are not attractive hun coz it has absolutely nothing to do with you.  He either has an addiction or if your fighting, doesn't like you much at the moment!  If you haven't had sex for a few months don't panic yet, but if it's been going on for a while it's an addiction.  Alot of guys watch porn and a little is ok I guess, but when a man would rather watch porn and be in a fantasy world rather than be with a real woman then it's an illness in my opinion.<br>  Please don't try to become like the woman in these porns! You are better than that and you will only hurt yourself and he will still prefer the porn after all your efforts.  He needs to be willing to admit there is a problem and seek counseling for it and even then it's a painfully long ( no sex for you) road.  My partner was damaged as a child with watching porn unfortunately and that's were his issue with porn began to develop but it can happen to anyone at anytime for what ever reason!  It is also hard for guys today not to fall into the trap when it is so in there face all time, TV adds and the internet!  At the moment I trying to decide after five years of hell, if I should go while I have a chance of a happier life or keeping fighting for change.|`|EJMwqU3caa	On-line porn has become an addiction for many people.  If you want to save your marriage, then you need to put an end to it.  Get your husband off the computer and talk to him, tell him how he's making you feel.  Suggest marriage counseling.  You're already on rocky grounds, the only way to smooth them out is to get the problems out in the open and talk about them!  Otherwise the resentment is just going to get worse and you're going to get even more miserable till you crack.  Maybe he's looking for something more in bed.  Maybe try being a little more adventurous for him.  Maybe the problem is much deeper than that.  Counseling can help pull out those underlying problems that no one is willing to openly admit. <br>  Also, pornography is very sinful and shameful.  No one should be watching it, but it can be a hard habbit to break. <br>  <br>  I pray that God will place his healing hand on your marriage.|`|jxshK9mnaa	I totally understand how you feel... I too had the same problem last year. I found that my bf had been watching porn while he rarely had sex with me - when I asked, he always said he's tired or sex is overated. I never approached him about it - was too scared to get into a big fight and dont want to let him know I found out about his porn vids on his pc or next time he'll know how to hide them. Well that was last year, I then just ignored it and spiced up our sex life in the beginning of this yr - and he just changed - he initiates sex and does it regularly. But he also has been exercising since then and he's not as tired as last yr, so that might be the cause too. I dont know, but I just know that it might not mean your husband doesn't love you, it could be other reasons. Afterall watching porn is just a fantasy, as long as he's not cheating. I suggest you talk to your husband though, communication is always the key. But don't start up the conversation by accusing.. or any sort of that. Just talk calmly and tell him you're not mad but you're confused and sad and go on with the topic. Hope this helps!|`|5FW8RFSKaa	Well, probably you're to occupied with other thing and has neglected him or did not have sex with him for a long time. Btw, it take two hands to clap. So, you should maybe try to approach him or rather arouse him. Tell me, do you enjoy sex?
AA12164862	oh brother...|`|cHBcR0Chaa	playground at night, like on the swings or slides. golf course. parking lot. in a dressing room. movie theater. started in an elevator. in a hotel hallway. fooled around in church. while driving down a long rode. that was hard as hell but really amazing. any place u can imagine it, you should do it.|`|CIGRQqd7aa	Dude, do it in the bedroom, people who have sex in public for the sake of " adventure " are usually bad in bed so they need some help with atmosphere.<br>  <br>  The sex won't change though.<br>  <br>  But if you really want advice, try locker rooms when it's mid day.<br>  <br>  Like at a pool when there's few people.
DcrI9zmkaa	Simply stated, you don't.  Why would you even want to make a guy say something like that?  If you have to force it, then it isn't true.  And, since you can't even say you love him, it's ridiculous for you to think he should be saying it to you.  <br>  <br>  Stop trying to rush things.  Lay off the "L-word" and just enjoy the relationship.  If it's meant to be, you will both say it when you feel it and *that* will be the right time.|`|kL8BzsBNaa	Why would you try to get him to tell you that if youre not prepared to say it back? Are you that self centered?|`|GmTs1BB1aa	love is a strong word.|`|gdW8rZt8aa	Be careful about that one.  It could turn him away from you.  You should probably wait for him to tell you, if he feels that way about you.  You could fish around for the answer.  I mean like you could tell him, if you feel alright about it, that you really like him, or care about him (don't say love yet).  Then you could ask him how he feels about you.  Or do it the opposite way around, meaning ask him how he feels about you first then tell him you feel the same (however he says he feels about you).  You don't want to run him off, especially if you've been together not too long.  Good luck.|`|xs5J6VJTaa	You can't. If he does love you he will tell you when he is ready. <br>  You also can't expect him to tell you this if you can't tell him how you feel.|`|253749a8c740b2b9ceb438a7f88d0d44aa	He'll say it when he feels it. You probably can make him say a lot of things, but you can't make him feel any of them.|`|3061ed3a2f1d09c904ae44f8dc455d7daa	Love can't be forced.  Just tell him bluntly how you feel or send it in a letter.|`|9Eq2Xxbmaa	you can't "get" a boy to love you. you can only be yourself and trust that if it was meant to be, he'd see how great you are, too. Just let things run their natural course and in time everything will work out. <3|`|dWp6KzM2aa	if you GET a boy to tell u he loves you then its not meaningful so it dosent matter "unless your self centered and need some one to say i love you"|`|9f0804ea76667e984da4cf6c36fd5d13aa	I have the same problem with a girl right now. But seriously just come out and tell him how you feel. If he likes you he will say the same thing back|`|oH7YiY01aa	destiny belongs to those who believe the beauty of their dreams.<br>  think it,"you're a woman"he shall not tell you if he doesnt feel.|`|YIJRZhoSaa	Don't worry about that, just let it be.|`|bdmRHIaZaa	you cant make a boy tell you he loves you?  Unless he is that type of guy that loves when you say stuff like that????|`|L6MLYMkhaa	Yeah, what the first guy said|`|IiJH6wF5aa	tell him how you feel, and be really nice and lirty.  Don't push it tho<br>  <br>  good luck|`|r7sw5JuWaa	You cant get him to say it and mean it if he doesn't feel it!
d0WK1j47aa	1. too many times to count LOL<br>  2. Guy usually falls down, coughs or grunts, grabs his nuts.<br>  3. oh HELL yeah.|`|LtP7oOtraa	oh my gosh they said the other things because they don't want you to go and hit a guy there because from what i understand it hurts like there's no tomorrow. i think i've hit like two or three guys there...they normally just grab them and lay on the ground for a little while. one looked like he wanted to cry. and it seems hard for them to get up and walk around after...yea i think that sends a pretty clear message
AA11651312	If it's a strange or unusual place, then I think its a very tell-all sign about his personality and whats to come. <br>  <br>  For example, when my friend first met this guy he wanted to take her to a themed motel. Some rooms were the "jungle" and others were the "room for romance". We learned he was a perv, sleaze ball, and not one she should have dated. <br>  <br>  I wouldn't read too much into it, if it's a typical place to take a date like the movies or dinner. If its like an art museum or a baseball game, he's probably either catering towards your interest or perhaps, picking something he knows a lot about or is good at to impress you.|`|YQYZR7I0aa	tell him he can hang with your friends does he want to come with and then u see his behavour to his answer
pvCfwkTJaa	she doesnt like you, touch luck kid
4zM5Zq1kaa	Start off easy..maybe by saying you have a nice smile or beautiful eyes...just compliment them a little. But remember stay lady like! AKA be sexy but classy! ;)|`|tAcWksQYaa	Umm Hmmm it's kinda natural... Like I guess you could giggle at their jokes or whatever.. um, hit them playfully, lock eyes with them for a couple seconds.. just be flirty. its hard to explain|`|uAzToWC7aa	joke with them, laugh and add on to thier jokes, smile, wink, text them, and yea....|`|3Pv32FxVaa	bit your bottom lip. <br>  <br>  SO SEXY.
PO5Q7POuaa	Well lateley I haven't even believed in this whole love process and I am still not sure of it because if love is love no matter what, then why do parents get divorced and what not? Am I right?<br>  Anywho. I don't think age plays a roll in love, I think maybe more experience and maturity does though. Because for example I know some girls who have hooked up with so many guys that after just dating one for two days they bring out the "love" word and how they couldn't live without them. Everyone is different though. Some people find their true loves at a young age while others may never find it. Everyone has a different meaning of love, so that would also mean that there is a whol different opinion on whether you have to be a certain age. But personally I believe that you can only be in love once you have been through the worst with someone but yet you can still look at them and know that you could never live without them. I'm still waiting for one boy to prove to me what love is, and I might end up waiting my whole life for all I care.|`|qy07K2k5aa	No, I would say it depends on the person's level of maturity and responsibility. I hate it when some of the older generation say that teenagers are foolish and naive and that the relationships never last. It pisses me off because it is so untrue.|`|TAMGy07Daa	William shakespear Had already proved that love can happen at ANY AGE.
FZKFLTyLaa	You're not ready for a committed relationship. <br>  Do what you think best based on that sure knowledge.
N7gOE1btaa	There are videos and sites online for how to properly use a condom.  Maybe you should have him check those out.  If you are worried about hurting his feelings, here is the best way to go about this:<br>  Tell him the reason you backed down the other night is because you feel you need to learn more about safe sex and techniques.  Then ask him to spend some time with you on the internet checking out information regarding this.  While doing this, have a preplanned site you will visit that will show proper condom use.  From this he will see how.  I think this is the best way.  <br>  Other options are during foreplay and right before sex, you put the condom on him, some guys like that.  Another option is to just roll with it--it wont hurt him if you have sex while the condom is over his testicles, but it will increase the chances of him getting sperm in you--so not a choice I advise unless you are on the pill and feel comfortable with that.|`|6U4sl15uaa	just show him these sites or have a friend tell him but make shure it a really close friend cause it might hurt him feelings<br>  other wise ask him if you can put the condom on yourself|`|hxDD9flkaa	Read the instructions on the packet !!|`|XdbO7QZ9aa	Get a guy to tell him what to do.. Like one of his close friends...
ibeVcQyWaa	Tell them.  It's part of you and if they don't like it, too bad!  Watch Ace of Cakes on the Food Network, see what this guy is doing with a hobby!
lNlL0Ag2aa	Lol that's the stupidest thing I heard in a long time. Just don't do anything at all.
SUOsfKYdaa	tell him!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|c5fe026d3f66620e4890ec5ccdc7edf7aa	Definitely tell him.
bMmV6R2Jaa	You cant get pregnant from oral sex.. and you shouldnt get sick and could even *** to like cummm . Its possible to get STD(  sexually transmitted diseases if he has one. and believe me . alot of men do!)<br>  So...  no you cant have a baby on that.. and if your going to do that. be prepared to keep going.. keep condoms nearby and USE THEM!|`|ntN3Bt5Qaa	Why would it. Its just a fluid the body produces right? When was the last time you  got sick from milk? I understand a cows not a person, but same idea. If you wanna swallow it then go ahead... unless you have ejaculation-intolerance... in that which case you may experience some gas problems...|`|N8zJERG5aa	Hi,<br>  <br>  No you can't get pregnant by swallowing it but you can catch STDs if the man's infected.  They just said it helps reduce the risk of breast cancer by swallowing it. You may learn to like the taste.|`|AA12346188	Nothing happens.<br>  It is a wastage like other things.<br>  It is just like eating/swallowing defecation.|`|vffZ3is4aa	You will make him very happy if you swallow. That moment is the culmination of everything and pulling out at the last moment is just, blah. Keep sucking, but be gentle, We are very sensitive after wards. just like your clit is. It shouldn't make you sick, unless you just find the taste gross. don't just bob your head. make love to it. use your hand to stroke it in time to your head ( it will prevent him from going in too deep and choking you). use your other hand to explore his body. use your nails on his stomach,thighs, sack. you can pinch his nipples, and the skin of his sack. do not cup his sack and squeeze real hard, I guarantee it will ruin the mood.<br>   pregnant--- if you get fluid from his tool on or in your vagina you can get pregnant. So if you are handling his tool, do not then move your hand to your vagina. keep his tool away from your crotch, and anything that may have his juices on it. <br>  Yes you can get an STD.|`|6U4sl15uaa	If you have a sensitive stomach you might get sick but you cant get pregnant that way|`|ghO0tNZcaa	NO,,,,,,,,nothing like that would happen.............only if it goes under u need to be tensed ok................................<br>  <br>  pls use condom....................SAFE SEX|`|xQGCf8GGaa	not at all<br>  nothing will happen<br>  be relax|`|lb8KlzFRaa	have safe sex.......use condoms<br>  n nthg will happen
IxoBFCpTaa	? I don't believe there is any question in this statement.
cHBcR0Chaa	I know i like gift cards, anything that has to do with my hobbies. clothes, shirts, boxers, pants. doesn't matter. home cooked meals. maybe if you take him to a sports game, or join him in one of his hobbies. pretty much just do anything he's likes and he'll love it.|`|82f7229d874223ffc501636d6a689c93aa	he will probably like anything that comes from you, maybe a sweater or something you think of. I am sure he will like it.|`|U3tSMBXsaa	Anything really. But since you know him better than I ever will, get him something that he's been talking about or that's related to a hobby he enjoys. <br>  <br>  Anyway, I'm sure presenting yourself or doing something cute or romantic will be nice :P Good luck!
lNlL0Ag2aa	I couldn't read the paragraph at all, but to answer your main question, I am dating my gf who is 22 and I'm 19 and it's not weird because she actually looks younger than me.<br>  <br>   So of course it's normal if the guy whose younger doesn't look like a kid while the girl looks like an adult, otherwise the girl wouldn't have fell in love with a younger guy if he didn't look mature.
cHBcR0Chaa	he's probably still cheating. that's why hes worried about you cheating. maybe you should yell at him. he cheated and left u 13 times!? ... not a good sign. let it all out, make him know exactly how you feel. don't bottle it up, that's bad in the long run. if he asks u questions and gets hurt by your answers, that's his fault. he asked the question. remember, the truth hurts. i say if he cheats or leaves u again, don't take him back. you can definitely do a lot better then a frequent cheater.|`|7MtjF084aa	I dont think you should get back with him...he has done alot to you... i think its time for you to move on..<br>  <br>  and take this life experience as a lesson..<br>  if he loved you he wouldnt cheat<br>  <br>  maybe be bestfriends??
uElJ37OFaa	i think about other cocks penetrating my mouth and anus|`|34nEGfFPaa	Because You love the thrill of the moment. You know you are not suppose to do that you know jack the beanstalk in public. So you enjoyed it|`|b02c7e5de4d776df907cfafdabdbc62eaa	Yes occasionally, it's worth it each time, except for the hair loss issues I am having.<br>  <br>  You enjoyed it more in public because you are a pervert and really need to just find a private place for your self pleasuring.|`|FiLchdiSaa	People get off to different things. When you masturbated in public you you probably felt the excitement of someone being able to watch you.|`|Gnsw0l9baa	i masterbate while i picture myself fuckin either hot girls at my schol, or gilrs i saw while watcing porn|`|Xexi7KCJaa	wow and i thought i had problems
GrCj35muaa	I'm a Marine girlfriend but I know what you are going through none the less. I never shut up about mine either. I look for these kinds of questions so I can talk about him more. He is on my mind 24/7. He's been my cousin's best friend since I was 9. Good luck and if you have any questions,, feel free to email me.
Zadysvg5aa	no harm,  he just wants to remain one of the lads.|`|pDqsFgjyaa	It's perfectly normal for a grown man to get crap like that from co-workers. It's the part of the information age that makes men revert to their teenage selves :P<br>  <br>  Seriously though, just because co-worker Dan sends a topless picture of some model, doesn't mean your hubby will take off like a bat out of hell on a conquest for her love, based solely on a picture of her boobs.... <br>  <br>  Can't say i blame you though for being worried, it's only natural to be protect of one you love :)|`|fynzkVK4aa	I personally think it depends upon what his spouse thinks about it...I wouldn't have a problem with my other half doing it, but I know it would upset some of my friends.<br>  <br>  At the end of the day, if it is just a laugh, and it does upset you, then not upsetting you should be more important to him than "having a laugh"..but I wouldn't find it anything to worry about, it doesn't mean anything like he doesn't fancy you or has gone off you etc., I am sure it is harmless fun with the lads ;)|`|ajzdsUldaa	Wouldn't be OK in my relationship, but I have no qualms with people who think that's OK - that's their business.<br>  <br>  Sounds a bit childish though - I've heard of this kind of thing when men have mid-life crises! Like, they need to obssess over naked women to feel young again. Most blokes grow out of that in their early to mid twenties. <br>  <br>  Not very mature. I feel for you.<br>  <br>  If it makes you feel uncomfortable, you should let him know and ask him to stop.|`|AA12074640	Clearly a case of mental immaturity, as well as using "herd mentality" as an excuse for a childish preoccupation. What would he say if you started collecting pictures of guy's crotches and telling him that all your friends and work colleagues did it just for fun?|`|AA12119862	its a bit odd but its only pictures - I wouldnt worry about it to much|`|YyOhT5xIaa	It's far better for a married woman to share pictures of herself with men on Yahoo Answers ;-)<br>  <br>  It's only fair.
Y8KmfOOsaa	i'm sure everyone's been in this situation or will be in this situation at some point in their life, on either end of the spectrum.  some people will be the confused girl stuck in the middle some people will be the guy who doesn't know what to do.<br>  <br>  anyway.  so this is kinda a tough one.  but no matter who gives you what advice, you know what to do.  do what feels right, what your gut and your heart tell you.  if you think in your hear telling her is a bad idea, but your heart says "tell her!"  than you should probably tell her cuz the more you wait the more you'll never know.<br>  <br>  so it seems that right now you are in the friendzone and she sees you as a guy she can talk to and confide in.  you don't want to ruin their relationship but he's obviously not good enough for her, not treating her well, not for her.<br>  <br>  i personally think you shouold tell her.  she might not like you right this minute, but she needs someone she trusts (you) to open her eyes and show her what she can't see.  show her this guy isn't worth her time, show her that you ARE, and then give her some space to elaborate on what happened.  she'll most likely eventually see that she likes you too and you are a great guy for her.  you guys already have a good friendship basis so a transition into a relationship isn't that hard.<br>  <br>  however this couldbackfire and you ahve to know that.  maybe she will get defensive for him and get mad at you for trying to "break them up."  or maybe she'll agree that he's not right for her, but neither are you.. you ahve to be ready for that kinda thing because it's always a possibility.  be open to her feelings and anything she has to say, and don't lose your cool.  sometimes we hear things we don't wanna hear, but we can't act like we're 5 years old about it, kicking and screaming.  you'll have to deal with it calmly and maturely.<br>  <br>  so in conculsion, do what you heart is telling you to do.  if you're torn between two decisions, think about it more and look a bit deeper. there's always one side of you pulling you a bit closer to one end of the spectrum.  i think you want to tell her.<br>  <br>  and when you do be prepared to deal with everything she says.  try to help her through the hard time and make her see fomr your point of view.  <br>  <br>  if worse comes to worst and she deosn't like you, remain friends.  she'll come around.  and if she doesn't, she missed out on a goooood thing.<br>  <br>  <br>  best of luck!|`|wHgBnMipaa	Keep being a good friend, and eventually, she'll see it.  At least that's what happens in the movies.  Make sure to talk yourself up and bring up his flaws as often as possible.  It'll happen, though!|`|ajzdsUldaa	That is very decent and respectful of you to avoid breaking them up. It takes a strong person to be so thoughful and sensitive about this kind of thing.<br>  <br>  It must be a tough situation for you. Her boyfriend doesn't treat her right, you know it, you like her and want to protect her - but as you say, you'd do everything to avoid splitting them up. Don't tell her that you like her. Eventually she will realise that her boyfriend is a jerk, and they will split up, no matter how long it takes.<br>  <br>  When they do eventually break up, then you can tell her, but be prepared in the fact that she probably won't get together with you straight away.<br>  <br>  The saying is nice guys finish last - this might be true, but I reckon nice guys finish up with the best.|`|Q0BP8Jneaa	i am totally there right now too. its freaking hard to not tell her anything... but ive kept it to myself. i would keep being that good friend nice guy bro, thats what i do... and its the closest i can be to her... and i'll take it. i know it really sucks bad... sometimes, its gotta wait and sometimes its gotta not happen the way everyone can imagine it. sorry bro, but this is the best answer i can give based off of my personal experience.|`|xluqxYj8aa	Well, if you really want her tell her how you feel and take her.. Dont be so soft, her BF is treatin her bad just take her..|`|Bgo0xmjnaa	Nice guys finish last<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  apparently........
DcrI9zmkaa	Simple solution:  Keep your legs shut and say "no" to anything sexual.  If he sticks around, he likes you.  If he doesn't, he likes sex.<br>  <br>  That being said, the fact you can't get a straight answer about the marriage thing says he probably is.  Of course, sInce you don't trust him, a straight answer wouldn't even matter, would it?<br>  <br>  My advice?  Move on.|`|gRXngD9aaa	Yeah right, deny him sex and he'll hang around - NOT !<br>  <br>  Does he make you horny?  If so, get busy, right now, at your work desk.<br>  <br>  Otherwise, forget it and move on.
AA10065812	??????????<br>  I assume by asking if paternity has to be established, you're not sure he's the father.<br>  <br>  If you go for child support, he can go for parenting rights.<br>  <br>  You violated his rights to his child, now you want to punish him for it.  Than can become a two way street when your child learns what you did.  Do you want to open that can of worms?|`|jlgfkyrEaa	In this case you would not be entitled to the child support for the previous years because you have kept the child from him and didn't notify him of the child's well being. However he  can sue you for keeping his child from him and file for custody of the child.|`|JI7NQ9TNaa	You can try for child support, if you can find him.<br>  However...he will be allowed to see his child if there is a child support agreement. The courts rarely terminate the father's rights---even in cases where a parent is incarcerated.<br>  <br>  And a paternity test today is still valid. The DNA didn't change.<br>  <br>  Good luck with this...|`|IgaW4g8Naa	you money grubbing whore.  you want to deny the father his rights to see his own AND collect money from him?  does that sound right to you?  good thing that the courts will not force this on him.  you will have to establish paternity and then he will have rights for visitation and a say in how the child is raised.  no just court would allow what you are wanting and you are morally bankrupt for even asking this question.|`|iblT1HJpaa	Well, now we know your character. <br>  <br>  You'd have sex outside of marriage, lie to your child and then try to blackmail the real father so you don;t have to reveal that you're really a ho under and through it all. <br>  <br>  You're despicable.|`|9NXtWzUOaa	let sleeping dogs lie.|`|phLqHzvaaa	The way i see it, you only want the mans money but not his involvement with the child??  If he pays child support he will have rights to to see his child whether you like it or not,every other weekend, holidays,summers, and nothing you can do about it.you can't have your cake and eat it to,also your son is 12, he is going to know whats up when you have to take him to the clinic where his dna will either be swabbed from the inside of his mouth or blood taken out, and that has to be done to determine he is the kids dad.<br>  The judge might also ask for the fathers name to be put on the birth certificate and to have the kids last name changed also.You probably won't get all 12 years back pay, since he did ask you for a test years ago and you didn't give it to  him so that means he had no idea he had a kid running around somewhere in north carolina that he probably would have helped support and raise if he would of been given the chance back then.|`|yqkOjhLaaa	I live in Texas so the laws may be different here, but I do know that if he is trying to say the child is not his, then you will have to establish paternity. However, your son could think that he is just going for a chek up or something because they just swab the mouth now. In the state of Texas you could go after him for back child support, and current support without him being able to see the child. It has been 12 years, and your son should not see this man that is for SURE!! Good luck it sounds like you have been going through a lot!!!
AA11879371	Only if he stays in Bosnia and does not come back to the United States.  If he comes back you can have him charged with bigamy.|`|KYdg8tpUaa	I wouldn't stick around to find out my dear..i would have already been out the door in a hurry when you found out the first time..i wouldn't wait around to see what hes up to..you deserve better and the kids do as well! he sounds like a complete jerk..|`|Ey8B12lXaa	He can but it's not legal. She probably works in Iraq and if he would marry her, she will never be able to come here because you guys are married. Plus I have been in Bosnia people over there don't send flowers. They might have some flower shops but no 1-800-flowers or such delivery company. Iraq is not that close to Bosnia. If I were you I would not be worried, the birth certificate thing might be needed only if they had a child for the proof of his identity or he needs it for something else. I don't think he can white out your name. You should e-mail him and confront him and tell him how you feel, you are his wife.
N7gOE1btaa	I would run...far away from that relationship.  I know its tough, but its unlikely they are "just friends" without deep feelings for eachother.  Eventually they will likely hook up again and you don't want that while he is with you.  Sorry for the pessimistic answer, but from experience with myself and seeing my friends go through it, I know its almost inevitable.
dm9evixvaa	prom is really fun, although if this is just a junior prom its not imperative you go, but next year at senior prom i'd say you should go no matter what. <br>  i kinda had the same problem you do (although maybe i'm not as good looking as you, and i'm a guy), but i ended up getting set up with somebody (well, kinda i talked to her multiple times beforehand) and it worked out really well.|`|wHgBnMipaa	People dance in groups at prom.  Don't worry about not having a date.  You can just dance with friends and things will be fine.  Don't worry too much about it or you'll ruin your night!|`|n708rCp0aa	hmm.<br>  i dont see anything wrong with going with a date-less girl friend. you could get corsages for each other! haha i would do that.<br>  if you do want an actual date, i would make the effort to find a guy who needed one. just go as regular ol' friends. clearly tell him that, too, so he doesnt get any ideas. :P<br>  <br>  i hope i helped some.. (:
wjkUJ0hmaa	if he's a player (and good at what he does)<br>  he won't let you see that side of him.<br>  if your gut says no about the situation then simply don't go there..<br>  it's not worth the drama.<br>  <br>  note to the person below me some players mess with you mentally rather than physically.. he could lead you on for as long as possible, some of them won't give in until they get what they want. if you have reason to be suspicious move on.. don't take his word if everyone else is saying otherwise.<br>  <br>  --<br>  <br>  the answer you want is that he isn't a player.. that's what you want to hear.. trust me i've been there. <br>  some things you have to learn by experience though.. try not to put your whole heart into it.|`|VjmTK6uZaa	Well, it's hard to hear. But your people/slash friends are probably telling the truth.  If they say he's only a player and only wants sex then he does.  Of course he will deny it, what guy wouldnt.  Face the fact that he is only seducing you to get into your pants.  Hard to face but its the fact.|`|f03edf3d3fe5d3e7c31416dd3871939aaa	dont give him sex|`|okjuXjrKaa	Go out with him and not give him any for awhile. If that's all he wants he will leave.|`|AA11296241	dont give in for a month - see his reaction.  if all he wanted was sex - he will move on.|`|lRBRh5qSaa	player|`|8M4WZ8x5aa	i think that you should follow your gut feeling and stay away from this guy. If he is after sex, you might end up getting hurt in the end. You dont want that. <br>  <br>  Plus, there are way more guys out there! ;)|`|5d965b5999b5a108beeaa2715ac0bf01aa	This guy's a player, and you picked up on it before you got played. <br>  <br>  "i have a bad vibe" <---- says it all right there
AA11150213	What you went through was horrible, but don't let it define you girl. <br>  <br>  Maybe you need to take sometime to build yourself back up. Whether it is getting some new items in your closet, changing your hair style, whatever. Doing things that will help you build up your confidence and make you feel good about yourself so that when you go out there and meet new people you'll be able to be the best you.<br>  <br>  I think you just need to go out there and meet people join clubs in your community, church, whatever activities you can do to meet people. Hold your head high and know that you deserve to be happy.
2wNUbdVPaa	Sounds like someone trying to have her cake and eat it too.<br>  <br>  I hate to say this, but even if she does leave this guy what makes you think she won't do this to you too?<br>  <br>  Cut your losses and get someone you deserve.
dCYbGaUuaa	I want 2 say that wut he did wus so wrong... That type of situation can effect u and your relationships to come.. I am so sorry to hear that... But I would say take your time and move on w/ your life... He is not someone who u would want to consider 2 try and work anything out...it will take time, but just do things that will take your mind off of him... Its going 2 b the summer time and there are so MANY other men out there...<br>  <br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK!!!!|`|Cx5QtfXXaa	Hunny...ive been there. 8 months isnt that long and just think maybe things wouldnt have worked out to begin with. Just try to move on and trust me i know its really really  hard but he kind of screwed you in that situation so id just move on. Like i said though, 8 months isnt that long to decide you want to get married. Ive been with my boyfriend for 3 1/2 years and we're not engaged yet. We do have achild together but no proposal yet...gotta make sure things are going to work out. For instance. Did you live with him? If not maybe you guys would have fought more if you did. GOOD LUCK AND MOVE ON!|`|5TIIgqhhaa	OMGG im sorry u have to go through this!! thats such a weird thingg tho ive never heard a story like that before..thats really fcked up! but there has to be some explanation, give him time..maybe 2 or 3 days? and call /text or watever u do, and just talk to him abt what the hell is going on!<br>  if hes an a$$hole again then forget him and tryy to move on because he isnt treating u like he should. everything happends for a reasonn;<br>  goodluck!!<3<br>  <br>  please help me with mine!<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=An5uTY7hRmmIN1ZCcE3TKBXsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090309185250AAuqYEs">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|S0MOQGJJaa	YES MOVE ON!

I am so sorry girl you deserve soooooooooooo much better
GRegSLA4aa	OMG SLIPKNOT!!!!!!!!!! - so jealous :/ <br>  <br>  Now ... Hmmm... maybe he likes you - yu don't go to the The Nine Kings for nothin :/ - usually if he didnt like yu he'd just say watever and not care, but since he was puttin thought into wat he was doin and sayin - hence the nervousness - its an early sign of "This Guy Is Developin A Crush On You". Maybe he doesnt like yu TOTALLY but... it mght get there lol <br>  <br>  = ]|`|f03edf3d3fe5d3e7c31416dd3871939aaa	first date is always nerve racking|`|EIgFDGOMaa	If he is nervous and all that, it might be LOVE!!

N7gOE1btaa	I read your story twice to get a feel for it.  You seem arrogant, full of yourself, and downright in love with yourself.  The fact that you had to bring up your grade point average says alot.  I suspect you talk about yourself alot and brag about yourself alot to her.  Its not intimidating, its arrogant.  I could be wrong, sorry if I am...but thats just what I thought from reading this.|`|8oX0wZAIaa	I don't know! If you look decent, they may think you're out of their league. Or if you're all nerdy-ish they might think you're a smart-aleck. Or if you're too into science they might think you aren't emotional and artsy enough. It's hard to tell without knowing you! Or perhaps you're physically big (weight or height...or just looks...).<br>  <br>  Anyway, it probably depends on the girl, as I prefer smart guys (I'm the straight A sorta gal too...wouldn't live without some intellectual stimulation!). Keep looking & you'll find someone.
fsF2SSVHaa	there is no such thing as a bisexual man. there are only really gullible straight guys who get fooled by gay guys|`|8IA3d3NNaa	In the past i have dated a bi-sexual guy so yes, in fact two of my friends from HS, a bisexual guy who dated my best friend (who is now engaged) and a girl i knew recently married so I guess it is possible.|`|298buQ6Oaa	NO.  To me that's cheating and is mean and unacceptable for both parties.  However if he was unattached and I really liked him, I'd def date him.  The thing is that girls (or anyone for that matter) want freedom and if you already have a boyfriend, well you're taken!
OdlYB79uaa	Make sure she's alone.  If she's with her friends, and you approach her, then her jealous friends would talk bad about you because they see a man approaching their friend.<br>  <br>  Have her notice you first, and then approach her.  You don't wanna come out the blue...That's sort of creepy.<br>  <br>  Be very confident.  In other words, love yourself more than you love her.  It may sound selfish, or whatnot, but girls dig a man who's confident.<br>  <br>  When talking to her, stare straight into her eyes and make it seem like she's the only one there at the mall.<br>  <br>  You have to be looking good.  A fresh haircut with some fresh clothes will do.  Also, put some cologne on (you can do some reasearch online and see which cologne girls like the most.)<br>  <br>  Make her laugh, but don't be corny.<br>  <br>  Keep the conversation very short.  You don't wanna sound desperate. <br>  <br>  Ask for her number.  If she rejects you, then don't lose your confidence.  Just remember there's a lot of girls out there.<br>  <br>  I hope I helped and gave you a visual.|`|wHgBnMipaa	Buy her a pretzel at the food court.|`|BrDEyUZraa	smile, come up to her and ask her for her number...its really cute trust me! also, be the first one to text.

392b18ae97259a7518f51868eb7ea463aa	What you have written down sounds like reason enough to me. If he truly is your best friend then he will hear you out and understand where you are coming from. Just tell him about the reasons that you have stated above. Elaborate on them in more detail and give him examples to ensure that he understands. Assure him that nobody else is in the picture and that nobody else has come between the two of you. Let him know that your reasons for breaking up with him are your own: personal and the product of changing over the course of the relationship. Make sure that you tell him that the two of you gave love a fair shot and in life, there is nothing more that two people can do. In your case, the two of you grew apart.<br>  <br>  Wishing the two of you only the best. And remember, don't make it out to be more than it is. It is better to realize that things didn't work out between the two of you sooner rather than later (after the knot has been tied). As hard as it may be, see the good in everything.|`|hP4K40eiaa	It sounds like you're ready to move on, but you're not going to be able to have him in your life because he still loves you. It won't be fair of him to ask him to be just your friend when he's been so much more than that for so long. You will break him. And you have to give him time to get over you if thats really what you want. YOu can't have the best of both worlds because its not fair, especially to him. Figure out if you really love him and what you want from him before you do anything though.|`|wuZXqYPGaa	i know its UBER painful to tell him after being with him for that long, but once you get the hard part over with you will feel relieved... he needs to know how ur feeling, and you never want to feel forced to love someone, love is deeper than that.. and he has to know so that you arent leadin him on no longer--- ya he will feel so hurt and feel probably depressed for a long time, but its better than bein in a marriage and YOU bein depressed. time will sooth all pain :D good luck|`|V5gELuFOaa	You have to figure out if it is worth the risk of telling him and losing him. This will most likely happen however it would be worst if you ended up marrying a person that you feel like this already with. End it now and move on before your sucked into a marriage with no spark.|`|mDBHMJPjaa	no, your just kinda bored..you will regret breaking up with him trust me :)|`|f03edf3d3fe5d3e7c31416dd3871939aaa	that's what happens in most relationships<br>  romance dies no sex longer your with him bordom
19iD220Jaa	I wouldn't JUST UP AND MOVE OUT just yet, however I would start looking for some 'back up plans' A.S.A.P.. Its obvious something not rite with this relationship (or with him) and I have been in one like it so Im going to read in between some lines here. It starts with cussing and insults, yelling, pushing to cheating, confronting and accusing, pushing to hitting, and hiding black eyes from your friends and family.... If you don't feel comfortable you should follow your  insistence's that's what they are made for... <br>  <br>  Of course try talking to him and let him know that you dislike being put in awkward position like when he lashes out like that and if he gets that mad with you then maybe it would be better not to spend so much time together... not breaking up... just giving some breathing room. Suggest that move out and visit often ... so that way if he wants to act a fool then you can take your azz home without the mental and / physical abruise. Yea truth hurts but love shouldn't. Trust me
GHZnLiYvaa	I wouldn't find that weird. Age is never a constraint when it comes to relationships. Yeah, but a big age difference of around 10 years might cause a generation gap problem.

zW8tc64qaa	Don't let insults affect your self esteem son. You need to remain confident, but at the same time, not conceited about it. Make sure that you have good posture when walking and sitting. Smile sometimes too, even if you don't think you have a nice smile (not saying you think this). Its a hard thing to do, but you can do it. Maintain good hygeine, posture, speech (speak clearly!). Girls like a guy who is confident, even if he isn't the best looking guy in the world. If you want to overcome shyness, talk to a girl about a class or an assignment and let the conversation flow from there. Sometimes you have to learn to work with what ya got. <br>  <br>  Now, go show em' what cha got!|`|v0kM2CRoaa	get a nice haircut and get a hobby. that will make you look clean shaven and your hobby and other interests will make it so that you couldnt care less to have a gf thereby making you more desirable. and CONFIDENCE.|`|MCudQz1gaa	Be yourself......hang with people you are comfortable with and something is bound to happen.

Start where you feel comfortable, for example a new hobby in something you like, maybe outside of school where you have a whole new set of people.  Then, just let your personality shine.  If you do feel you need to lose weight, do it for yourself, your health.  And approach girls who are friendly to you.  If you smile and they smile back, that's a good sign.
VjmTK6uZaa	You certainly are in the right to be all over her case about this.  you need to just tell her that you really don't want her to do this and ask her what she would do if she were in your feet.  She is not looking at the fact what has happened.  SO give her a reality check.  Either you can go with her or she goes with her friends against what you ask.  Also tell her that if anything happens, then it is over and no more second chances.|`|YDRqfuv8aa	well u shouldnt be all up in her u know...if u have trust issues..tell her...|`|vPDOu5qfaa	You may as well go.

There is a web-site called lovingyou.com, it has all kinds of free love stuff on it.  You can send her personalized e-cards, to let her know how much you are thinking of her/ love her/ etc for free and you can use it as often as you like.

You should start kinda phone flirting with her and making her remember all the good times you BOTH had TOGETHER! ^__^ I mean, if you want her back, you should totally go for it! :] I'm sure you guys had love and if you were the one who broke it off, chances are she still loves you! But...you guys do need to get together in person somehow and when you do...show her an awesome time! With flowers and candy...the works! :] Make it romantic!! Good luck! Long distance can work...it just takes compromise and patience on both parts! <3|`|amMAThVLaa	Well if it was your first love you wont be able to forger her...Cause we never forget our first love.<br>  If you still talk to her and if shes single maybe you can meet with her and talk.<br>  Or if you don't talk to her anymore maybe you should just tr to move on with someone else. You won't forget her but you'll eventually like someone else. :D Hope this helps|`|hNXoevQaaa	tell her how u feel is the first and only thing u can do.<br>  see how she reacts...if she takes u back, then ur meant to be.<br>  if not, then atleast u know how she feels|`|ITucJoZ4aa	you still talk to her?|`|0ktcvglRaa	Just forget about her and move on, as hard as it may be. Time heals all wounds. You'll find someone for you eventually. How long as it been since you two broke up?
69jCkURdaa	first try to fix the prob with your bf, try to find ways to see each other and if your still not super happy, then let him know and he'll try to fix it. then if your really really not happy then do what you feel is right.<br>  <br>  but dont break his heart for nothing, becuase that will hurt him<br>  and this new boy you met can also do that to you<br>  becareful|`|Dep7loNXaa	Honesty is your best way in life.<br>  <br>  Tell him the truth (with the time issue). It's better to say something sooner than later... it'll hurt him more in the long run|`|h53UJhqhaa	you should definitely talk to him about how you feel. but ask yourself a few questions: why are you breaking up with him? do you still have feelings for him? will you have time for the new guy?<br>  <br>  if you are breaking up with your current bf cuz you barely have time for him, you need to make sure you will have time for this new boyfriend. however if you still really care for your current boyfriend, perhaps talk to him, and just tell him it has been really hard never getting to see him.
KIFMQ8CIaa	i actually agree with that someone. i think that hot is a bit sl*tty looking while cute is pretty/snow white looking|`|TyL32j9gaa	Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.|`|qy07K2k5aa	Since you don't like that remark, ignore it, but there's no need to take other people's opinions of you so seriously.
hhCRwQ1Saa	I don't think you're destined to be alone.  Nobody is.  However we've almost been conditioned to think that we're supposed to marry our high school sweet heart and we're supposed to get married or at least be in a serious, almost married relationship at a young age. <br>  It's okay to be single and it's okay to wait and see for that perfect guy.  The one that makes your heart literally stop the moment you see him and it pitter patter fast when he comes and says hello because you're stuck on stupid just at the looks of him.  <br>  I was single a lot through out high school and none of my serious relationships lasted more than a year and most were over before they actually ended and just kept going at more of a friend pace.  When I was 22 it happened... I'm telling you I went to a local bar (bad place to meet Mr. Right for the most part) in my pj's, hair in pig tails and some slippers when I sat down next to this guy at the bar.  Took my breath away and he really wasn't my type at all.  We talked all night, then had a late night denny's dinner and then we talked on the phone a lot but never saw each other for months after that. I was running scared. I got a boy friend he go a girlfriend and we ran into each other at the bar again and that was it. My fate was sealed.  I knew it was which was why I avoided that bar like the plague. We both broke up with our current significant others and have been together ever since.<br>  It definitly hits you when you least expect it or are even looking for it.  <br>  To fix your problem though you need to get some transportation.  Buy a used car or something.  Being stuck with only your shoes, a bike, a bus or someone else all the time really puts a damper on being able to find any one new.<br>  As trite as it sounds all you have to do is stop waiting for it to happen and just live your life the best you can and make yourself happy.  Then Mr. Right will come flying into your life and sweep you off your feet before you've even said hello.|`|gpX0FXu3aa	I'd try volunteering with an organization of some sort (maybe with a friend). Volunteer work is a great way to meet people.|`|69jCkURdaa	i was in the sme boat like you age included<br>  and its comes when you least expect it<br>  you cant move around searching for things, becuz when mister right comes your way you'll miss out on him, so stay put and be positive :)
9yj86j0Caa	Your parents would be very irresponsible to leave you alone with your friends in a campground.  They could also be charged with child neglect if caught.|`|XjJmIQJhaa	I think that maybe you should change your plans to say like a hiking/road trip during the daytime/evening time<br>  <br>  because you are not quite 18 and they'll most likely be reluctant to let you do whatever you want<br>  <br>  parents are overprotective for a reason, we live in a very sick world, you never know who's out in those woods.  They usually know (more often then not, from their many years of trail and error) whether or not you will be able to go on trips without them.<br>  <br>  but if you really want to have it at night then flattery always works with my parents, and always ALWAYS ask them when they are in a GOOD mood that always works too!|`|vqEaTmU2aa	Well I don't know how your parents are, but if you tell them that you've never done anything wrong and want some trust then you would like to do this without their involvement.<br>  <br>  It's going to be at a campground - i.e. there will be supervision (well I would imagine), it just won't be by your parents. Just tell them that and see how they react to it.<br>  <br>  And if they say no... well, it's a campground, so I imagine it's pretty big... you could probably get away with doing some stuff without them knowing. =)|`|wuZXqYPGaa	just talk to them and ask them 5 reasons why they dont think its a good idea, usually in that situation if ur pretty trustable in the past, they can only think of 2 haha so then that iwll open their eyes a bit. plus you got to tell them thats ur turning 16 which is kinda a huge age.. and so tell them in 2 yrs ur gonna be an adult, so why not give you freedom now? hope you have fun campin!
4kMBnjaPaa	maybe you should make a move?|`|u7Y1SAViaa	Well, it seems your story shows it that way. Talk to her, break the ice that's so thinly cracking. She really does want to talk to you.|`|hXdt1lntaa	maybe she's curious about why you talked to her before and why you dont now...but she does seem interested in you|`|pNOp9peTaa	The classic you make the move first kind of thing. Well you know shes into sports so why not try to see if you guys connect in basketball. If your the shy type of guy and happen not to be a big talker, just smile to her once in a while and walk away. Let her come to you, that will at least give u a better idea of where she wants to go and smiling to a girl you never talked to is never corny. First impression mean a big thing and a smile will gain you a good start. Good luck.|`|h53UJhqhaa	sounds to me like she is just observant because she sees you at places she goes. you have to go up and talk to her. just showing up where she is will start to freak her out|`|gAflmxDRaa	hell yea, of course she is. she's probably flirting|`|lVx1E6gQaa	i think that the girl is interested in you..she just wants you to ask her out..the eye contact that she gives you shows that she's interested she's just shy.. try to make conversation when you see her again and even try to ask her to hang out.
esXp2ENEaa	I think that you should talk with him about it tell him that you want to do everything that you can to please him and make him happy and if he tells you what he likes than you would be happy please him (if that's the case witch it seems it is) This would also be a good time to bring up your fantasy's as well as his|`|8VtqxobDaa	take him to strip club and give him a lap dance.<br>  touch urself in front of him.|`|qy07K2k5aa	A couple months should be fine.|`|69jCkURdaa	wear a corset
x5ba1SN2aa	Yes.<br>  He could call just to make sure your home, and to be checking up at you. He may also want to stay over, and watch some movies,or something else.
Nf2tYZ3uaa	i'm used to be in the same boat. i met this guy in 9th. he was amazing and i feel for him bad. we were just friends but we used to stay up into the wee hours of the morning myspacing or iming about anything and everthing. then he got a gf and slowly moved farther and farther away and i felt i couldnt give up. thats how badly i was gone. last year i had him sign my yearbook. we acted like we didnt really know eachother. like those people ur acquaintances w/?  that was 10th. this year is 11th and he transferred to another high school and i only see him now and again and my heart still races and i still blush and wonder whats wrong w/ me. and i know i shouldnt after all that. i think whats wrong w/ both of us is that its hard to let go when what you had before was so good and thats all you know. that he may have changed now but you cant help remember what it was before. the best thing is to try to get your mind off of it. join a sport (hes on the same so that didnt work out for me) get into a club or something. the best thing thats worked for me is forgetting.what else can u do? senior year im going into a program at the college and i had no idea but when i went to the meeting and he was there butterflies still filled my stomache. ive had crushes but this is more and i know it. all we can do is either forget or try our best make it come true. good luck-nessi
FoWxxqTjaa	lol. you sound young.<br>  <br>  skip all the second person crap and just say it to him!!!<br>  "i like you!"<br>  <br>  and then boy says "i like you too!"<br>  <br>  yay you guys kiss, makeout, cuddle a little more and everyone is clear. bada bing bada boom.
lVx1E6gQaa	A. well to flirt, your main thing is to make eye contact. you have to show him your interested. then, when you guys do talk, you want to keep eye contact and touch his arm a lot. i think that you have to just be open and not stubborn.<br>  <br>  B. well i think that there are many ways to tell if a guy likes you. if he seems to always compliment or talk about you, it shows that he's interested. also, if a guy flirts as in like trying to hug you and treating you really different than the other people around you, then he's interested.<br>  <br>  C. Again, the whole eye contact thing is the main point. you dont have to stare, but steal glances at him and make sure that he notices you lookin at him. Also, you want to smile and show your attention when you are talking to him, so that he knows that you r interested in what he's saying.|`|dwGh0qB9aa	A.  Hold eye contact with him and smile.<br>  B.  Every guy has his own way of showing it.  Some guys will tease you.  Some guys will talk to you constantly.  Some guys will straight out tell you he likes you.  And almost every guy will flirt.  My boyfriend showed me he liked me by always making me laugh, always talking to me, sometimes friendly teasing,  (not that much), and eventually, he just told me he liked me.  And now we're a happy couple!<br>  C. If he drops something, pick it up for him.  Hold eye contact with him and grin that cute, big, bright grin I bet you have :)|`|33IV2bDYaa	1. Act all upset with him, put your mean face on.  "Hey!! I've been standing over there for 10 minutes checking you out and waiting for you to notice.  What's your problem?  Just stuck your own little world?"<br>  Then give him a big smile.  See what he says.<br>  <br>  <br>  2.  If he picks on you, teases you, looks at you a lot, if he stands close to you.  <br>  <br>  3. Tease him, play around with him.  Jokingly make fun of him.  Smile, hit him and call him a brat or a jerk.  Don't forget to smile.  Haha.|`|Bfwg0eBJaa	a. just say hi and act casual<br>  <br>  b.

KmWjsc71aa	You need be direct about it. There's no way to avoid it. First of all, if she has been in touch with this guy and hiding it from you, it means that she's spent a certain amount of time thinking about him. <br>  <br>  Second of all, I'm sorry but I don't believe that he "kind of forced it upon" her. What is that about? If she didn't want to then she got raped, but as you can see, she's happy enough to stay in touch with him and text him every day.<br>  <br>  Communication is elementary in order for your relationship to stay strong and healthy and right now you're not getting it from her. I understand she chose to tell you but she needs to address how she feels about the guy. You definitely need to reevaluate your relationship to this girl, and there's no other way around it than to ask her to come clean.|`|zka26204aa	If you are on break, she has every right to text whomever she wants.  If you are together, tell her that you feel that she is disrespecting you by texting her ex and deleting it as if she has something to hide.  Tell her that if she wants to go back to him, just be honest with you.
J14tPA9Eaa	yes<br>  <br>  i am not a lawnmower|`|WSZVJRIwaa	I prefer a woman to be shaved, but it's absolutely fine just as long as it's trimmed and maintained.|`|m2eHPeciaa	OMG, how many times do girls ask this... shaved or not shaved? that is the question... LOL (shaved, im not gay)|`|EHRI5ZxIaa	doesn't bother me.|`|FQwNi3kMaa	yes.|`|lqINcThraa	Yes.. It feels better not only for the guy, but for the girl too.. And there is nothing in the way per say.

Oooh so sexy.|`|ajNTSffmaa	Please.|`|DCzSBPUjaa	lmao Random Guy!<br>  <br>  And yes.. 100%|`|ulUBv22eaa	yea|`|771702cc138b8e49b58a97fac0fcaa49aa	It doesnt have to be bald but definitely at least trimmed up and neat.  I had an ex who didnt do anything down there and you couldnt even see it.  It was a big turn off.
aXOyK3uBaa	The best condom is the kind that doesn't break.. but you also have to remember to put TABASCO / HOT SAUCE in it after you throw it away.<br>  <br>  Remember.... its Legal in this country for a woman to LIE about being on the pill, and its legal for her to allow herself to get pregnant without a man's consent.<br>  <br>  3 women in the last 4 months in California tried to take the used condom out of the garbage and use the sperm to get themselves pregnant to trap a man into paying child support for the next 18 years.<br>  <br>  The men put HOT TABASCO sauce in the condom<br>  and they ran out of the bathroom crying and screaming.<br>  <br>  Serves them right!!<br>  <br>  These girls tried to SUE the men...<br>  but they lost and the man can countersue for EXTORTION.<br>  <br>  Make sure you flush your condoms or use hot sauce. The interesting part is.... the women KNOW they've done something WRONG. So when their vagina is burning they can't tell you why.<br>  <br>  Every man needs to know these stories.<br>  ALWAYS use a condom and MAKE SURE<br>  she doesn't get pregnant. <br>  <br>  Or you will be PAYING FOR IT for the next 18 years.<br>  <br>  If anyone gives a "thumbs down" to this answer..... then you know its' just a p!ssed-off girl who's mad because men out there are smarter than she is.<br>  <br>  If a girl has a problem with you putting tabasco in your condoms, then you should get rid of her right away.|`|9qSD385Paa	I would go with Trojan. Usually i say brand names aren't that important, but when it comes to being able to possibly get/impregnate someone i wouldn't recommend generic brands. You want something you know is reliable. They also have a large variety of colors, textures, lube amounts, etc etc.|`|fCdR3gSjaa	durex my friend|`|mM7YuOzbaa	The one that helps prevent STD's and pregnancy.|`|3p6fXiFpaa	Pleasure wise: Trojan (thinner, easier to feel)<br>  Protection wise:Durex (thicker less likely to break)<br>  <br>  Always check over your condoms for holes, package piercing, ect.<br>  Flavored condoms can cause infections in females if they contain sugar and can leave an unpleasant discharge that will stain.<br>  (Female opinion if that matters. Hope it helps)|`|AOtnoozdaa	None!  Hahaha...  JK.  No, I use condoms because I'm safe.  In my opinion.  Anything that doesn't break.

For safety, anythings better than nothing.<br>  This is really an opinion and based on personal preference.<br>  <br>  Some like certain materials and textures. There are TONS of different kinds.<br>  Tactylon, like polyurethane, doesn't cause allergic reactions and stretches more comfortably than latex.<br>  <br>  By far the most advanced condom material is a medical polyurethane called Microsheer, which is thinner and stronger than latex.<br>  They transmit body heat, are nonallergenic and have no taste or smell.<br>   Beyond that, like I said its a preference.<br>  <br>  For latex (and domestic product) Durex Extra Sensitive Condoms are pretty tops.|`|tHbihIcuaa	rather than us contraceptives, i have perfected yelling at any embryos my seed might create until the soundwaves break them down into stemcells and I then use htem to fix the ghost of christopher reeves.<br>  <br>  <br>  but then again no womans womb can hold the awesome power that is my seed.<br>  <br>  go wit htrojan, if htey have money to advertise on tv, they are either good, or seriously overpriced.|`|NflzJrEwaa	My hubby and I use Trojan's and Durex, weve tried basically every condom, and althoug hthere may be cheaper ones, their not as good of a quality.

Hope this helps!|`|lVx1E6gQaa	Trojan is #1 condom..especially the flavored kind|`|AA10450644	Depends on your needs. Too broad of a question, dude. Just make sure you don't have an allergic reaction to latex. It can lead to death in some cases.|`|T61ZN70Baa	Any condoms is good long as you are protected in what ever you do.

771702cc138b8e49b58a97fac0fcaa49aa	The only thing sex really does is prolong a bad relationship.  Both of you can be completely miserable but if the sex is good you will stay a lot longer then you should.

Why create so much drama over whether to talk to them or not and what do I say?<br>  <br>  Just talk to them, say what your would say to any of your other friends you hadn't talk to for a while.

827993b38a683884568367c98043c28caa	With the makeup, which is very nice, you do look between 12-14.  I suspect without makeup, you might look younger.  I know at your age, most girls want to look older, but looking older than you are can put you into situations you might not be ready for.

PCcbECdZaa	This makes me think about a girl in my class. <br>  <br>  She's got an old soul, she's a sweetheart, and has a boyfriend four years younger than her. Age difference aside, her parents dissaprove of their relationship due to the difference in middle school/high school. Personally, I can see her dating someone OLDER because of her maturity level. If it were the right guy and he wasn't going to take advantage of her (whether it's illegal or not) then I can see it, because of her personality and heart. He would probably get along with her better than anyone in our entire school. <br>  <br>  Now, If she were to grow up and marry this guy, he'd be 50 when she's 20! Quite frankly, that's just like half of the rich men these days. I suppose if it's love, it's love! When you find love, don't turn it down just because of the age difference. <br>  <br>  Though it may pose many problems, I don't think it's terrible! If it works, it works! It just needs to be at the right time, with the right people.|`|l0opvMfGaa	it's too bad if u r trying this silly thing|`|t3qUiPlWaa	I personally don't think that relationships like this could work out well, because people your own age are experiencing the same things in life as you are, therefore you have more in common. Unlike someone who has already gone through the periods of life that your going through. So there is a missunderstanding aspect in the relationship. Also, the older person had more time to really establsih themselves in life, so there could be inequalities (ex: financially).|`|QcvG6LXDaa	um well depends the ages. assuming the girl is younger, if the man is in his 60s or older she will be called a gold digger by many and may not be worth it. if she is veryy young as in early 20s the man may be criticized. <br>  however if its love theres always an exception!|`|cOBk3NxQaa	wow. hmm. i dont know.

jlzdQSmzaa	Do some really of the way nice things for them before you ask & Just approach them and ask them very nicely and let them know that nothing will happen between you two and that you just don't want to be away from him and maybe they will understand? Good Luck!|`|F0sJR0jbaa	Your 18 they shouldn't have a problem with it.  It will also be a great time for your family to get to know him.  I think they will be totally ok with it.  I wouldn't suggest taking your best friend though.  I know she might be important to you but make it a bonding trip with your guy.  She doesn't need to be there.|`|wHgBnMipaa	"Can by boyfriend come, too?"<br>  <br>  If your parents are anything like mine, they will say no.|`|0ktcvglRaa	Just ask them! They should be okay with it. A lot of people bring their significant others to weddings.|`|wFVsoAGGaa	I mean this in all seriousness, just ask them.  The worst that they will say is no, and then you can just move on and see him when you get back.  If they say yes, then great, have fun.  Either way be respectful.  It's better to ask and be turned down and accept it with grace and humility than it is to try to work around things and create problems.  Just ask.|`|34e9e9fe0d4bc19d020a1064cd382799aa	Well, seeing as though you are 18, you should simply go up to them, and say something to the effect of this......<br>  Mother, Father, I believe I am old enough now to be responsible enough to take a trip with my partner.

AA11155064	Oblivious or not interested?<br>  You're confused?<br>  <br>  Ever thought HE'S confused too? <br>  You apparently flirt (as he does) with many, exchange glances sometimes and have intermediaries involved.<br>  To him, if he is shy or uncertain, there is not a lot to suggest he has your especial interest. He may not choose to express having any interest in you if it seems unrequited.<br>  Chances are he may know your hat-band size and blood group (in addition to your shoe color) but will not admit it if he thinks you are uninterested.<br>  <br>  Why females think that pregnant/ significant/ meaningful glances/ looks/ stares is effective communication escapes me. <br>  Many relationships have foundered on the use of them. Be upfront, speak directly to him. Don't leave him uncertain; give him an opening to be friendly, socialise and explore.<br>   In equalitarian times, why must the male always have to risk rebuff and embarrassment?<br>  Step up, open up and be ready to be taken up.<br>  <br>  Incidentally.....<br>  Shoe color is the last thing a guy notices ........ after he's made a lot of other observations first. ;)|`|tU5NJVL3aa	I'd say he doesn't know you well enough to either like or dislike you.  If you want things to change, you are going to have to make it happen.  Since you are a self-confessed flirt, what's keeping you from flirting with him?|`|UOmH9vaPaa	He could still like you. If he's not with anyone then he can take interest in all kinds of girls. That party doesn't mean anything.

z0edOrw5aa	He seriously shouldn't expect you to abstain from any relationships for four months. I mean, it's great that you might not want to date anyone else, but it would be pretty selfish of him to expect that of you, especially since you've only been emailing. Hopefully that's not the case! =D<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|O9XgdOmmaa	Usually it takes 45-90 days of actually going out with each other for a couple to be in an exclusive relationship. Since you haven't been dating, I don't think he expects you to be committed to him yet.|`|Jtg9LBJWaa	First of all, you've only talked online, so how do you know if you really mesh well? Second of all, if you do go meet this guy, don't go alone, it's very dangerous because he could be someone completely different than who he says he is. You never know what creepers are out there. Don't hang on to someone you've never met, so date other people if you want to.
qRIMM2ycaa	Start calling your other options, and if she does call you back, I'd say it depends on what kind of excuse she gives for ditching on your meeting.<br>  You never know, her mom might have died or something.<br>  <br>  But if she just forgot, oops! Then don't call her back|`|997sxSawaa	If you do go ahead with her I would have a back up just to be safe. Give it another day or two if you don't hear from her try again and when you leave a message just tell her you realize your wedding isn't until Aug but you would like to get everything taken care of. Also if you book her keep in touch with her from time to time just make sure everything is still a go. Good luck|`|GZQXsOKDaa	Your wedding photographs are a very important part of your future. You will one day want to look back over them and see what a fantastic day you had and when times are tough you can look back over them and remember all the reasons why you married your spouse.<br>  <br>  My advice don't take chances on your photographer - you want someone you can trust to turn up on the day and create some wonderful memories for you.<br>  <br>  I hope you find the one you want.|`|Q3Hh1aiEaa	I would find a new photographer. They can be pretty pricey but she seems like she's just wasting your time and she might be trying to be slick. Ditch her. your wedding is suppose to be special if she can't return your phone calls how do you know if she'll even be @ your wedding. Good luck to you!|`|2Av3gIqgaa	Definitely sounds flaky and sketchy.  I wouldn't go with this person.  If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.<br>  <br>  Go with someone else in your price range who is more reliable.  You should never feel like you might be bothering the person who is photographing your wedding.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|TJKvoLeBaa	Do not waste your time with this person.   It is probably just someone with a nice camera that does weddings on the side.  <br>  Think about it, if she is flaking now, do you want her flaking on your wedding day!  Pass and move on.|`|RPoFBenJaa	Due to the fact that she is so affordable and does good work, she probably has a ton of clients. Just keep trying, shes a business owner she wont mind that you are persistent!|`|omr1Kv3Haa	I'd go with your gut. Your women's intuition is telling you something- go with someone else. There are plenty of good photographers out there needing work now.|`|4POGapREaa	Don't call again . . . EVER.  You'll be b*tching about this woman for ages when you can't get a hold of her to get your prints, when she charges you the wrong amount, when she's "unavailable" for days, when the pictures are crap & nothing like her samples, etc.  She's not professional.  I do freelance work (nothing like photography though) and regardless of whether I can take a job or not, I always call people back.  I'm not in the business of wasting other people's time & I want my reputation to be good because I actually care what people think of me.  Even F ups are on point when trying to GET a client so I would say NO.  Move on.  Getting the deal is the most crucial part of it, coming through with your promises is another thing.  She's treating it like she couldn't care less & she doesn't even have your check in the bank yet.  Ditch her.|`|47af2fda89839c0ec02e273cff59d82daa	if you have left messages and she hasnt responded to those, then call her one more time and tell her "im sorry, but we have yet to sort out a chance to meet, and i need to find a photographer before its too late, so i need to start looking elsewhere"<br>  <br>  if she truely is interested in your business, she will call you back in a heartbeat after she gets that message<br>  <br>  also, i totally agree with the answerer below me.  if i could vote her as best answer somehow, she would definatly be in the lead right now|`|469c6489c23d9264a9454703f8b8c28baa	The "very affordable" sets off "conman" bells in my head. Whenever someone seriously undercuts the competition, they're either outright lying or misleading customers about what they will get, or they don't do as good a job as their portfolio would lead you to believe and are presenting themselves as something they aren't.<br>  <br>  Never pick a wedding vendor whose rates are significantly lower than the competition. They are not "cutting out the middleman and passing the savings along", and they are not "new to the business". There's always a true reason why they quote low, and that reason is never good.|`|AA10018260	Totally move on.  She is NOT reliable.  Wouldn't it suck if she didn't show up on your special day?  She maybe be affordable and in your price range but I am wondering how many weddings or special events she was a no show at.  That is the first thing that would go thru my mind.  I would rather pay more or have pictures that were not as good in quality than to have no pictures at all.  Good luck.|`|2o3BHgCCaa	Imagine if it was your wedding day and you were calling her and she wasn't answering...<br>  Her work may be fabulous and she may be cheap, but she is unreliable. Not something you want on a day where there are no do-overs.<br>  I suggest you move on and find someone else to do it.|`|hs793CCxaa	I am a Wedding Photographer - when your wedding is over you have your rings, Marriage Certificate and your photos, that's it. You will look at your rings daily and your photos often - choose your photographer carefully. If it were my Wedding, there is no way I would even consider her. You must have alarm bells ringing or you wouldn't have asked here - take notice of them and look elsewhere.<br>  <br>  DON'T go on just price. There is a HUGE amount of work AFTER the Wedding for the photographer to do to your images - cheap means that corners get cut. Cheap means that the person doesn't necessarily know all the little "tricks of the trade" to get the best results. I have done this for years, and still get nervous before each Wedding, due to the special nature of the event. You don't want someone who works during the week and just does Wedding Photography on weekends (weekend warriors) as YOUR photographer. If they get nervous, with their limited knowledge, things get over looked. <br>  <br>  I have been asked several times by brides if I can "fix up" the photos a "cheap" photographer took. No decent photographer will touch someone else's work to fix it up. YOU are left with it. <br>  <br>  I will tell you a quick story. I was booked to photograph a wedding, but the bride told me that they only wanted me to do the Ceremony - another photographer would do the rest. On the day I am out the front of the church waiting for the bride to arrive when a lady races up to me and asks if I have any  (type of) batteries for her camera as hers are flat. She said "It's been a couple of months since I used the camera and they are flat.....". THIS was the other "photographer".<br>  <br>  Take care who you select - your photos will be with you for the rest of your life. Don't take the "cheap" option. Best of luck.
e8d3b3207846607c507e3dc6eaca10edaa	Sounds like he does not like what you talk about on the phone.  He does not like your topics.<br>  <br>  He might like to talk about some topics all the time.<br>  <br>  The most common reason a husband does not want to talk to his wife is that she is all negative.  She does not call for good reasons.  She calls to remind him of things she is forcing him to do, remind him of things he needs to do, things he has not done, family problems, money problems, and so on.<br>  <br>  And all that negative stuff is upsetting.  And if you talk to him on the phone, I'd guess he was at work.  And at work a guy likes to just think and focus about work.  The last thing he wants is a phone call from his wife, whining  how he left that single spoon in the sink a year ago and they need to talk about how he does the dishes.|`|6VYzHD51aa	Yeah men use to love woman back in the day . But you all changed so much we don't know who you are .
jMytFom7aa	ok here it is. men and women want sex, that's just nature. they have done nothing wrong by desiring you sexually. the difference between a good guy and a bad guy is a bad guy only wants sex, a good guy wants your love and affection, but he still wants to bag you too! if you don't want to have sex, then don't, but don't think someone is wrong to want you physically. i am a 32 yr old guy and i am very honest. hope this helps|`|smtSdiKhaa	It is the sad truth. However, trust me, there will be that one guy that will want you and respect you for who you are. I admire you for telling him that you want wait until marriage and for keeping your goal. Guys only want sex because they are unmature, they are unsecure, and its just nature|`|o3nlj6wGaa	You're either smokin hot or the guys are just really horne|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	get smart and wake up. this guy is a loser and don't let him force you to do anything. get away from this person. he will use you and throw you away.|`|xDdhUldraa	Thank you Rawwr for qualifying your question.  It isn't all of us that are that way.  Be that as it may, a lot of males (females too) want sex because they do not know any other way to show affection and have found that this is one way they "feel" expresses themselves.  Sometimes, as you have found out, it is best to steer clear of such people and try to do the best you can with the catch you can make.  Hang in there.  The wait is worth the time!
eAIapfXsaa	In my sociology class the textbook said that black women are the most abused population segment in America. That might have something to do with it. I've met a few sweet black girls. I met one that I felt a really strong chemistry with. I wish I had made a move on her. <br>  <br>  As for liking thugs, back in primitive times, the "bad guys" probably were better able to protect women. So I think it's a primitive instinct. A lot of girls of other races like bad boys too. It wasn't that long ago when your safety as a woman depended on having a good fighter to protect you. Even now, women feel some need for protection.|`|K8wDgNwbaa	nobody understands what they're saying. plus they are mad all the time for some reason|`|ZXxIjIP9aa	maybe u are meeting the women because i know plenty of black females that wouldn't date an excon, are just a sweet as can be, and are married with kids all by their very successful husbands. u r just looking in all the wrong places.|`|cOBk3NxQaa	You poor dear. I'm a black women (but I'm not one of the 8/10 trust me). And I agree, a lot of women out there have issues. But you know, it has to do with how they were raised and what they see in today's pop culture. those thugs with low pants, black women acting like hoochy or naggy women, its all over tv and in music. and people copy that. they think that's where its all at. they think its cool, and it most certainly is NOT.<br>  <br>  Let me just assure you that there are nice black women out there with good heads on their shoulders. You'll meet them if you're looking in the right places. Good day to you :)
2724e8c32a9de71dca3f16697d9d6ebbaa	Generally people who are biracial are viewed more black than white because of their appearance.  One of my closest girlfriends is biracial, and when she is out with her white mother she says she gets a lot of rude comments even in this day and age.  Blacks accept them better than white people.  I am actually one of the few white friends she has.|`|i4QPLfEVaa	Well it probably the area. I've seen many biracial girls go for white guys.|`|U5mYBXA2aa	I'm black and i would beg to differ...

BI1Ma4vVaa	I am only five feet tall so five foot seven is TALL for me. I could not imagine dating someone over six feet.<br>  <br>  I don't think it actually matters that much to most girls though. I mean there are limits to height but I think that it is relative only to how tall the girl is. A five foot ten girl is probably going to want someone over six feet whereas five foot seven is perfect for little me.|`|SRzL2Wexaa	Really you know this?  I didn't and I'm a woman.  As long as a guy is my height or taller, I don't give a s---.  But, the guy has to be decent in all the other ways, and if he's my height he shouldn't weigh 100 pounds more than I do.|`|lq0JNwK7aa	I'm only 4'11 (and I'm 19 years old -.- ), so to me you're tall!<br>  <br>  I think girls usually prefer a guy who is taller for a sense of security.<br>  <br>  I personally don't care so much.|`|ShdV8jm4aa	Don't dwell on it. Guys are built differently than women, they are usually taller. The old standard of "tall, dark, and handsome" I believe has kind of gone kaput.|`|m2eHPeciaa	5'7 is average. i would PREFER to be with a guy that tall, but my BF is about ur height, so i would say ur OK. :)|`|SLIIyjyRaa	5'7" is fine.

Pr2eOhliaa	first of all, nobody cares how tall you are or how much you wiegh.<br>  if she seems interested in you as more than the friends that you two are, there might be something there. but if you think that she looks at you the same way she would a friend, then i think your wasting your time. its safe to still be her friend and all. dont leave her just like that, but since she is taken, and if she shows no signs of wanting anything more from you than friendship, the odds are low. <br>  <br>  if she does treat you like possibly more than a friend, you might have something. but i would wait until her and her man are done. she could be commited.

This allows a testing of the waters without investing in a major date.
UHXNA1Imaa	Hello Millie,<br>  <br>  I know this reply is a little lengthy but I want to cover as much as I can regarding Wardens or Scheme Managers.<br>  <br>  I live in a Sheltered Housing Scheme.<br>  <br>  Of course you need to qualify for Sheltered Housing due to age, ill health, disability etc,, but I am assuming you know this and do qualify.<br>  <br>  Wardens, or Scheme Managers as they are often called, cannot dictate to you what you do or where you go, or when.<br>  <br>  They simply provide an on the spot help service in the event you need help with an accident or illness.<br>  <br>  Like everywhere, there are really good managers and there are really bad ones. Where I live mine is pretty bad.<br>  <br>  Most Scheme Managers do hold a master key in order to get into your home if you need help and to let emergency services in.<br>  <br>  They are not allowed to tell you when to go out or come in, although some often do try to rule those residents under their care. Neither are they allowed to enter your home without your permssion unless in the event of an emergency.<br>  <br>  Normally they should contact their residents in the mornings either by knocking on their door or contact them and checking that their residents are OK via a call system which should be in each sheltered flat etc.<br>  <br>  Some have medical knowledge and are qualified to perform first aid, but most are not.<br>  <br>  The Scheme Manager is also responsible for the day to day running of the scheme, ensuring that the communal areas are kept clean and work required is done by contractors.<br>  <br>  Good Managers also arrange trips and get together etc, in the scheme communal areas.<br>  <br>  Be warned though that a 'live  in' Scheme Manager is likely to quickly become a thing of the past as the Government is saying that they will no longer be required or wanted to live in the scheme they manage and the schemes will be linked up to an emergency call centre, quite often miles away from where you actually live.The managers will probably end up with a roving brief which means they will be required to deal with several sheltered schemes, rather than just one.<br>  <br>  For more information please contact Age Concern at:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ageconcern.org.uk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.ageconcern.org.uk/</a><br>  <br>  They will be able to give you all the information you need about Scheme Managers and Sheltered Housing.<br>  <br>  Another site you may find of interest is Mature Times at:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.maturetimes.co.uk/search/node/live+in+wardens" rel="nofollow">http://www.maturetimes.co.uk/search/node...</a><br>  <br>  This will give you information about  'disappearing' Wardens/Scheme Managers'.<br>  <br>  I hope this has been of help to you.<br>  <br>  Poseidon|`|KtR0NstMaa	I'm assuming you are talking about assisted living?   If so, they do have a key but for use only if you do not answer and they are concerned that something has happened to you.  <br>  <br>  They would check their check out book and if you have not checked out they then let themselves in your apartment to see if you are there and need help.  If you have fallen and can't answer you would be grateful that they could get in to help you.<br>  <br>  They ask you to sign out when going out and ask you to sign again upon arriving back.  If you are leaving for a few days you should tell someone that you are going to be gone for how many days, so they are aware.<br>  <br>  You are paying for them to check up on you and help you with the things that have become difficult for you.  Depending on what you sign up for they would help you with meals, medications, laundry, etc.<br>  <br>  Give this place a call and ask questions so you understand just what it is all about.    <br>  <br>  If I am wrong about you talking about assisted living - I am sorry|`|d0526f2bf35299e2ac74512f8dff025faa	Each unit varies.  They do not tell residents when to come and go, what to eat, etc.   But they call regularly to ensure that the residents are OK<br>  In some cases they may have keys for emergency purposes, but otherwise should not enter without permission.<br>  They are not Prison Officers they are wardens.

AA10961538	don't talk to him any more hes a jerk and he showed his true colors early which is in your favor you'll never be able to depend on him when your down and out and all alone he isn't mature and not to bright either because he is a liar and your deserve much better you sound like a girl with a good head on her shoulders so don't waste your time nor your life on a man who isn't up to your expectations|`|UcgWrGaAaa	I am very worried about you.  <br>  <br>  Maybe he wanted to loan you the money but didn't have it and was embarassed to tell you he didn't have it.  You should definitely know what a spot he put you in.  Look, this might have been an event and not necessarily a pattern.  You really have to talk it over with him and find out why he said yes and then didn't call.  You have to stay calm because if you start freaking then it might be a temptation for him to start lying to you.<br>  <br>  Do you have a plan as far as where you can go, I mean what about next months rent?  Is there a friend or family member, even distant you could stay with?  I am very worried about you.  Obviously you have come so far and the potential to make something of yourself is tremendous.  I'm really proud of  you.<br>  <br>  You have to hold yourself together and do whatever you can to stay in school.  Tell everyone around you, is there a student services office you can ask for help.  There are food banks around.  Maybe you could link up with someone at www.Coabode.com  Do you have a church that could help?<br>  <br>  Please keep me posted,  I am saying a prayer for you.|`|g6pqGjrkaa	Ignore the thing which brought you to earth will give the way through another person, be relaxed.|`|3264b09af40e6311a70d315c1f4ed8e3aa	He's not the one.  And tell him outright that he left you hanging.  Without going into anything else about your background, just tell him that he said he would loan you the money and then disappeared.  Go ahead and tell him you were relying on him and you could have gotten evicted.  Tell him you had been  calling him and don't let him give you any bullshit that he hadn't heard from you.  He probably just decided not to give you the money and figured he'd wait it out until he knew it was too late so one way or another he wouldn't have to give it to you.  That is not the guy you want to be with, in fact, that is a guy you shouldn't even talk to.<br>  <br>  I've been in a situation similar to yours and when you are that screwed around already, anyone being nice to you can be interpreted as 'the one.'  Be very careful not to make a serious mistake.|`|b7bb85526b028b7f92b16c8204ed4012aa	Holding your hurt feelings inside is normal. I think you know exactly what you have to do here with this guy. Hecant be trusted in a time of need so hes definitely no knight in shining armor for you. So send him pdking and tell him that you needed aman to step forward and help you but  instead he played games and ran off like a little boy. You dont need him so move on and find a real man who will be there when you need him. Good luck|`|elhcuN19aa	Me I would tell the land lord my situation<br>  but if push comes to shove you may have to move in with a relative or a friend....<br>  <br>  And that guy is not for you......<br>  I felt the same way with my exgf til I caught her cheating<br>  I say times of crisis shows who are your real friends...<br>  <br>  I know your story semi cuz' your are one of my contacts Remember what I said. Dont be super desperate for love from a member of the opposite sex. fully but also the good book says we all fall short and he fell short also<br>  <br>  He could have lent you 25 bucks I mean I dropped that on a date on my cheating ex lol|`|rKatyfKBaa	I would just leave him alone..he obviously doesn't care about you ,knowing your situation an d then deserting you. You are young and my advice is to live within your means..if you can't afford it you don't need it. I will tell you a secret..and that is be the best friend you can be and it will in turn generate really good friends that have your back no matter what. Life is hard and in your situation...much like my own..you need someone in your corner ..you need friends. Be honest and give when you can and look for support groups take advantages of clothes closets and whatever free or trade sites you can find in your community..maybe volunteer at a food pantry for a little food for yourself if your situation warrants.<br>  Just some tips I hope will help. <br>  One other thing is never depend on anyone but yourself for what you need, its a harsh reality but its oh so true I have learned. Its nice to get help but not at the expense of degrading yourself or feeling like you are now..confused. Take advantage of government programs and such if you need to without abusing the system..but I am sure if you look there are lots of help there for you........ and friends waiting to have your back. Best of luck to you.

You have no idea on how to tell how many more lies or secrets hes hiding here. Best bet is to get out and away from this guy.

If for some reason you have the urge to cut yourself, than go get some ice cream (don't eat it with a knife). Take your mind off a certain thing by thinking about other things that interest you (besides cutting yourself). If you tell him, tell him that you will try to stop (that is if he doesn't like it).

0ktcvglRaa	It's hard to tell if he likes you, or if he's just being friendly. Try flirting with him a little bit and asking him more questions to get to know him better!|`|wjEkyLZ6aa	Sounds like he likes you! As to speeding things up, I would go with just randomly hugging him.

Get his friends and your friends together and go do something.  His response will tell you if he likes you or not.

If you wanna try to push things a bit and see if he feels the same then you might try asking him to accompany you to a movie, you know, in a normal "hey wanna go watch a movie this weekend?" and then look for cues if he agrees. Sometimes guys can be a bit shy or nervous about making the first move so if you think he's really into you, try something subtle like "accidentally" touching his hand.

1ZuF9FdSaa	I had sex with one of my ex g/fs about two hours after meeting her and we have had a great relationship that I wouldn't have changed a thing about.  We are currently good friends living over 2k miles apart but she is still very attractive and amazing to me.  If the chemistry is there, then it's never too soon.   If you're 40, then you should be mature enough to handle having sex and not have those teenager moments of awkward post-sex "something has changed"  but then again I don't know you or this guy.. there are so many different people and views out there you really need to know this for yourself and actually I apologize for stating my opinion because maybe it's only specific to me.  I think now that you should have sex when you are comfortable and not worried about this.  Maybe you should talk with him about it, it will bring you guys together!|`|0LqslIMLaa	It can ruin things but its really not some end all thing. I had this girlfriend, she was by far the closest and greatest I've ever had. Best relationship ever. We started going out on the new years, we kissed once, the next day I went on a date with her, and we both just kinda needed it, so we had sex. It didn't ruin anything, although at the time I was really worried it was. If you've kissed or anything then you could try getting more intimate if you think its right. If you havn't kissed or anything yet, then I'd wait till that train passes first.|`|d0WQ2pZNaa	This may make him want to stick around even longer, you never know.<br>  When you're 40, I don't think it can ruin things, hopefully you're both mature enough and have been through enough to know what sex can do to relationships and people, are aware of that and can work through whatever happens and just enjoy it for what it is!|`|5IJO3bzpaa	i was just talking to my dad about this today. We were saying that by the time grown ups are in their 40s they don't need to play the little games anymore, you know what you have in life and what you are looking for and so should the other person, so getting intimate should only make things stronger if you are both looking for the same thing. Just make sure you communicate well. good luck.|`|Tw79BIbjaa	Sex will heighten the seriousness, only naturally. It's considered the "next step" to most people.

Well here goes.  <br>  <br>  Absolutely not.  Most men are smart enough not to say anything.  If you thought his brother was hot, would you say something?  I think not.  That's because you're not an idget.  <br>  <br>  Sorry, but all men fantasize.  If he just had a little tact about it, it wouldn't be such an issue.  Most guys are smart enough to know that it's a bad idea to tell your wife that you fantasize about her best friend.  Derrrrrr.  <br>  <br>  Everyone fantasizes... yes, even women fantasize.  Typically, I'd say: "As long as the fantasies stay that way, it's no big deal".  But I typically take for granted the fact that most people have a bit of common sense, and they'd know not to say what he's saying.  Sorry :(|`|bXmRWbEdaa	A lot of men fantasize about threesomes, just because it can lead to more sexual pleasure.   The fact that he fantasizes about threesomes does not mean you are inadequate.

Not all men are like that.|`|MZWH11w1aa	I have been married 17 years.  We are young too.  My first thought is that he shared these thoughts with you.  That is a really good start.  It means that he trusts you and you have good communication.  Maybe you just need to spice up your sex life a little.  Go to a sex toy store together.  You don't need to get anything "gross", just something fun.  Also, maybe you should be the one who initiates the sexual relationship once in a while.  Maybe he is just looking for something new.  It doesn't mean that he doesn't find YOU attractive.  If the feelings don't change and you can't get over it you should DEFINITELY see a marriage counselor.  You don't have to be in a "bad" relationship to see a therapist.  20 years is a huge accomplishment but sometimes you may need extra guidance.  Anything is worth keeping your marriage happy.  Good luck.|`|Mf5i0Hcraa	No your not wrong for being hurt, but the question should be what do you want to do about it ? It sounds as if you are very attractive so that doesn't seem to be the problem. Is there something else that getting in the way of intimacy between the two of you, money,kids , stress, ? How do you make him feel as a husband, man , father , provider ? Have you turned him down so many times in the past the he doesn't pursue you any more ? How did he make you feel before finding out about his Fantasies? Sometimes fantasies can be very helpful in the bed room After all have you never fantasized about another man , maybe a famous actor or athlete? Are you still attracted to him ? Ask him if he wants you or if there is something he wants to try new with you ? We all like to hear that others think we're attractive and sexy . I bet he's not feeling that you think much of him after 20 years.|`|SL4eEoCNaa	As others have indicated - All men I know have fantasies.  Most do not share them.  Some women here don't want to admit that men are different than them in many ways - especially sexually.  And I say  vive la difference!  Women's thoughts and fantasies tend to be less sexual and more romantic or relationship oriented. Just because a man thinks and works differently does not make him inferior or wrong.  <br>  <br>  Your husband needs to be more understanding and not tell you everything that goes through his head.  <br>  <br>  Try to be understanding of him as you would expect him to be understanding of the way you think.|`|aErUKUvVaa	Not all men treat their wives like this.  But i'm confident all, or nearly all men, THINK like this.  We are all genetically designed to have as many women as we can to sew our seads.  It's not like we made this up and threw it in ur face.  We're the hunter/gatherer/farmer side.....  He shouldn't be telling u, or u shouldn't be investigating him if thats the case, to find out what he's thinking, but if my wife found out who I fantasized about, i'd ask her who she does too.  Cus I think that women do some of the same things too, but are much more discreet.  No?  U dont have any guys in ur circle of friends/work that u'd do? Think about? He definitely needs to pay more attention to u and make u the priority, but u shouldnt take it personally or offensively.  Ur obviously hot, so make sure he know's when there are other guys whistling at u when ur together.... it may just make him hold u closer....|`|WHvWcrfAaa	Hey I really understand wat u must be goin thru..to achive anything in life one needs to have plans, plan it and u will succeed,if he enjoys thinkin bout ur friends then u talk bout them get him turned on but make sure u don't feel bad bout it have paitence, am sure u both will have a wild nite do it for few days then u tell him how guys looked at u, just make up a story and no loving hubby would tolerate this.. at that point u make him realise ur feelings too.. if he got brain he will surely understand|`|3ad05f51839ba1e01125f9c9a1ac29a9aa	all men have their fantasies, every thing was going well with you till you found out these mails.<br>  as long he keep it as fantasy, you don't have to worry specially he is giving you sex daily...z
KO4kkypnaa	It sounds like she was deeply hurt by the break up. She was really really hurt by you wanting to be just friends and gave her "free" tirade as a defence mechanism. She doesn't want you to know that you had that effect on her and she wants to appear strong so she is saying this stuff to try to hurt you, almost like bullies in grade school. She is just trying to feel good about herself. She probably still has big feelings for you and is being mean to cover her pain.<br>  <br>  If you want to help the relationship, you should talk to her about it. Let her know that you still care about her *in whatever way* and that this isn't about her. You have to cut her some slack here because she is just really hurting righit now. Give her her time to grieve.|`|Nhi8cxAvaa	hey, hey, hey! boys are dumb, too!|`|HQb4wL1Eaa	Women do not like to be told what they can and can not do. Especially by her ex boyfriend. To be honest she was just getting defensive to what you said to her and you brought that on your self. I think you should apologize and let her do what she wants because im sure you are.|`|nw8ql9gdaa	if you care bout someone and want to be with them you shouldnt be figuring things out on your own you shouldve talked with her about it. cuz now sounds like shes rubbing it in ur face that she thinks u  fucked up by letting her go. so now u decide if you want to be with her or not. and speak up before its too late|`|JPyo2M9gaa	its because guys are idiots and also hormones have a huge factor in it too .|`|T61ZN70Baa	Well...boys act crazy and stupid too so lets not go there. When you said you needed time (which is good and she should understand) and you could be friends until then maybe came off as selfish because it is on your time when you guys will be back together. She is probably lashing out and pissed at you because the letter probably came out of no where. She is probably trying to make you jealous and mad by saying she is free and she could do any guy she pleases to. If you really like her or whatever then give her time to cool off but I would move on cause she is  seems like she is going to play games now to piss you off and stuff.
6a65TIrgaa	Sorry to break it to you honey but he is most likely messing around with other girls. Especially since he is in the army. I have a friend in the army and he cheats on his girlfriend all the time like no tomorrow. I think hes up to 50 girls now down in Texas. Anybody can sweet talk on the internet and lead a girl on. Just let this go because he just wants to mash and dash. You may go into denial after reading this but its the truth. Move on.|`|5iOHJHUzaa	If your grammar and spelling hasn't turned him off, nothing will.|`|A1rfDaANaa	juss tell him what yu wrote here that you were worried and that you were'nt sure if he was ok or not and you were scared that sum happened to him and that ur sorry that you did that and tell him thaty ur not crazy that u were juss peranoid and yu thought he got hurt

8IfePMa3aa	Yuck! A good friend of 8 years actually did that to me and I felt so trapped and violated. The event lead my brain to associate this person's touch with a negative feeling - I can't bring myself hug him anymore.

jfsul7ENaa	just do it with her|`|Xel3S1W5aa	Oh my God! No! DO NOT DO THAT! If you are so much in love with your gf then why the HELL would you have sex with another girl?!<br>  If you've been with your gf for 4 years, then you guys should be really comfortable with each other. Your gf will not care at all about how you are down there. If she does, than you shouldn't be with her anyways. If she loves you, she'll love the sex.<br>  <br>  Sorry for freaking out at the top but just do not have sex with another girl. That is like the worst thing you can do.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps :]|`|7dgxGPlDaa	Let me get this right. you have a girlfriend, but want to sleep with another for the experience. that's called a cheater. just look at a porn and get the idea. most men's private area is darken than their skin color.|`|lTsONvwQaa	Are you crazy! do not sleep with someone else if she really cares about you it wont matter besides she knows your a virgin so she wont be expecting much just go for it dont worry about impressing her|`|65jyxyz4aa	not smart! that is qualifyed as cheating! plus thats way weird. u guys could think u like eachother and that wouldnt be good. im positive u can satisfy ur girlfriend. just dont do anything u might regret!|`|6QgW0bkbaa	having sex with the friend is a horrible idea.

Just tell her the truth.|`|b3YMLS61aa	you have been with her for 4 years and havent done it? just do it with her. you may be surprised|`|3wWpKexoaa	You can't just use someone to 'test' yourself out, and then go off and have a real relationship with someone else. Your friend probably hopes that by s3x with you, she will be able to have a relationship with you, not just get used as a test drive for someone you really care about.<br>  <br>  If your gf is fond of you she won't care what your 'member' looks like, although the fact that you are unaware that this is very common is a worry.<br>  <br>  You sound too young to be indulging in such antics, and your lack of experience coupled with lack of practical knowledge could lead to a serious problem ~ such as pregnancy, because you have no idea how to prevent it.<br>  <br>  Do some more study on this important subject before you contemplate doing something which could be a cause of lasting regret for both of you, instead of a pleasant adventure of romance and passion.<br>  <br>  Good luck and best wishes :-)|`|iVapI5JPaa	wow if you really want to ruin it with your girlfriend bring in another girl. If you want to make her happy, stay away from the other girls.<br>  <br>  Besides, you don't just "use" other girls as practice. Sex is not a game or just for fun. It is really meaningful.

An intervention sounds like a good idea. Have you talked to his family about this? I would talk to them and, see what they think about the situation first, if you haven't done this already. But, you need to wait until he is sober, and clean before you think about setting a date. I have been married for 4 years to a man, that I love dearly but, I hate his addictions. I didn't know how out of control it could get until we were married. He is a recovering alcoholic, and still slips up every now and then. It's hard on everyone involved. So, be careful and, get this man some help if he will take it. Good luck!|`|ml2FDYECaa	It all depends on how you want the rest of his family to handle the situation.

I would just go with the straightforward approach here and set something up.  Next time you two are talking, ask her what she's doing on Friday night( or a night you two both have off) and set up some coffee or a movie.  Just be like, " so yeah what are your plans on Friday night?"  She will then answer, then you shoud go, " oh yeah, we should go see a movie or something."  I'm sure she will say yes.  Yes, you will be nervous.  But once you ask, you'll feel great about it!  Just go for it dude.

17e9dd5261b81da256fe99427e074568aa	I was always saying when I was around 16, that imagine to have the experience of a 35 year old in a 16 year olds body and know all the trick and tips on how to flirt and how to get a girl to like you. Well, I'm 36 now, and I have acquired that experience for the last 20 years. The 3 key tips I would like to give you are:<br>  <br>  1. Approach. Say hello.<br>  <br>  2. Show interest in her. Say something nice about her. Make her feel good about herself.  <br>  <br>  3. Appearance is of key importance. Your looks, your style. Take care of it!
cOBk3NxQaa	1. looks at you a lot but if you look at him he looks away quick, or he could keep staring. looking at you in general is a good way to tell.<br>  2. more outgoing guys might flirt with you, tease you. shy guys will be nervous/quiet around you. a general change in behavior when he's with you.<br>  3. if a shy guy gets along normally with other girls but with you he's nervous or has nothing to say, he probably likes you.<br>  4. is "around" a lot. there's no real way of explaining this one. he's just around you. he'll pass by you, hang out in the same place you do, he's just around. lol.<br>  5. Blushing, smiling a lot,  freezing up or giving simple answers when you talk to him. does nice, little things for you like hand you something that's yours.<br>  6. Suddenly, he dresses nicely...not all guys do this, but some may. and others may subconsciously mess with their hair, etc. when you're near.<br>  <br>  Lots more tips here!<br>  <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Category:Getting-a-Date" rel="nofollow">http://www.wikihow.com/Category:Getting-...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Know-if-a-Guy-Likes-You" rel="nofollow">http://www.wikihow.com/Know-if-a-Guy-Lik...</a><br>  <a href="http://links2love.com/" rel="nofollow">http://links2love.com/</a>|`|SRzL2Wexaa	All I know is he'll probably come on here asking for help.

Talk about anything you see that you both have in common, like a school assignment or teacher... or anything !!! :)<br>  <br>  good luck, once you have talked a  couple of times it wont be awkward asking for his number<br>  <br>  <br>  (also this solution stops the awkward "i've texted you and you know about me, but i don't know how to talk to you in person")|`|WQHdQmK2aa	For the record im a shy guy.

Your problem is that you still have some underlying feelings toward your ex. You need to understand that you will never meet someone like him and that you need to either try and work things out or move on. If you don't let him go you will continue being disappointed with the new guys you date because you will be looking for him, or a guy just like him and it'll never happen. Talk to your ex and make you guys and your feelings are done.

If you do have options, self supporting options, you should sit down with your mother and calmly discuss your feelings, as well as her feelings.  If you have some other family member or friend that you mother respects, invite them along to help mediate.|`|qNMfaJ4Raa	If you're worried that she'll kick you out, you shouldn't tell her.

wpi36XBAaa	"Can a marriage work if both parties are determined to make it last forever? Even if they fight everyday?"<br>  Your Answer: If they work out WHY they fight everyday and learn better ways to communicate their disagreements, BEFORE they make any decision to tie the knot, then yes it can work. <br>  If they enter the marriage constantly fighting, then no it won't work long term. It will tear them apart. <br>  A couple that fights over "every little thing" has deeper issues that they are not addressing. It won't work until they do.|`|uGN7Lmg0aa	I'm not sure what you mean by "fighting".<br>  <br>  My great-aunt and -uncle got on each others' nerves almost daily, and fought pretty often, but I know they loved each other.<br>  <br>  I couldn't deal with that in my own marriage, though.  I'm just not put together that way.<br>  <br>  So I guess what I'm trying to ask is, is this what you want?  (Serious question, maybe he's worth it.)<br>  <br>  If you think things could be better, maybe some pre-marriage counseling could be in the cards?|`|48e54c6394da5ea92d90b07084568dcfaa	Not if you fight everyday, and when you′re determined to make it work you stop fighting, you communicate, you talk, you use basics skill communications to find ways to harmonize and make life togheter something worh it. If you fight everyday there is something that you haven′t been able to solve..I don′t see how a marriage can survive under that kind of pressure...you′re not enemies..marriage is not a battlefield..Love don′t fight, love reconciles..|`|WUwIk3Fgaa	That's between you and your SO. Only you know how much drama you and he can and want to handle on a daily basis. Marriage is hard enough when you get along great. You have to be extremely determined to make a marriage work where personalities clash all of the time. GOOD LUCK.|`|uVwPykXlaa	yes it can work,but before fighting,will you find yo flawes and let him find his..then take it from there.<br>  its said the 1st yr of marriage its hard,but as time goes on with input from both parties,u can be bests of friends..<br>  am a witness to that..am on my 3rd yr in marriage,the 1st yr we were ready to hang the towel,but we toked and worked it out..we happy..hes my buddy for life|`|TTjDATeOaa	Eventually fighting makes one or the other party want to leave. why would you want that for the rest of your life? Are you insane? Why not start a marriage with someone you don't fight with and vow to make that work? Seems more logical.|`|j1XCuKQ2aa	I think it won't work. If u fight everyday then chances are that after marriage u will fight more. After marriage chances of fighting increases and love somehow reduces.<br>  One of my best friend fights with her girlfriend a lot. He tells me mostly bad part of her and accuses her on back and still thinks he is in love with her. I don't think his relationship will work out.<br>  <br>  Just think twice before getting married.

392b18ae97259a7518f51868eb7ea463aa	Awesome poem!<br>  <br>  1. Mankind is one word, though. So it would read: Erasing all of makind's greed<br>  <br>  2. These lines should read in the present-tense (not in the past-tense):<br>  A nation where people look beyond the surface<br>  A nation where everything you have is embraced<br>  and...<br>  Living in a world where everyone is insecure<br>  <br>  3. Here are a few suggestions. Don't feel like you need to take any of them, as your poem is pretty solid just as it is. <br>  -Being in love minus the lust?<br>  -Preventing bloodshed for which there is no need (No need and needlessly is redundant)|`|F0sJR0jbaa	That actually sounds great.  Idk what kind of poem the assignment is or whatever (i remember there is different kinds of poems)  but that sounds phenomenal|`|cOBk3NxQaa	It sounds good to me. It's pretty.<br>  Tips: make sure all grammer is correct (like the last line should be was instead of were). think about what you want the words in your poem to mean, what you want your readers to feel, and make sure your writing gets that across.<br>  <br>  oh, and you'd probably get better advice if you place this in a different section, writing or something.|`|Jjjg7jcraa	Oh my god!

Some guys flirt with girls like that and girls really go for that, they love the attention.
T61ZN70Baa	Yes I have had that feel many times b4 and yea it is great except for when you are getting mixed feelings cause that is not cool. Give it a lil more time and see if you are still getting these mixed vibes from this guy and if so then maybe you should make a move on him or talk to him. Also, love/relationships is scary especially when you are trying to win over who ever you are going after. It sounds like you have a fear of rejection which EVERYONE goes through at times when they like some one and want to take it to the next level. It's ok it makes me nervous too to be honest but life is all about taking risk so go for it because you don't want to have any regrets about something you never did but wanted to do so bad and you let slip right through your fingers.

I'm sorry, but I think that is the real reason. <br>  <br>  But it doesn't hurt to give it one more chance because you don't want to regret it!|`|4iT5OzsCaa	hmm.. If the two reason's are untrue, how did she come up with them?<br>  Perhaps you said something, not meaning for her to take it like that, but she did..<br>  And in order to "save" it you might wann wait a little while, and just try talk to her as a friend again, cause it seems she doesnt wanna talk to you, other then that there's not really naything else I can say to do..

Sorry bud.|`|Ikd9cppcaa	If she broke up with you, just leave it that way. Evidently, you aren't telling us something but my guess is she is interested in another guy.

And if he is calm and says I'm not, then say okay and forget about it. Because I still talk to my guy friends even though I have a bf of 1 year and a half. I have been through some rough sh** with him, and it just made everything better in the end to push through it. If he gets defensive and mean, then he's cheating.|`|EPHnYYEdaa	Jealousy, to me, is unhealthy and it seems that it is unnecessary in a relationship built on trust. It also seems that your friend has answered your question regarding commitment by him being on a site talking to other female. You are both 20, young and he sounds like he is not ready to be a one woman man yet, which is understandable. You deserve to be treated with respect, do you feel respected. It sounds like his actions are affecting your feelings of self worth, and I don't think you need to feel less than as a result of someone else's actions, and value system. However, it is truly up to you; however, I have not seen jealousy benefit any relationship.

AA10757358	Yelling is not the same as physical abuse.  If they are hurting you physically then go to your school councilor or principle or any adult and tell them.  Physical abuse is wrong and you do not have to put up with it.  If they are yelling at you, you can have deft ears to what they are saying (tune them out).  Go to your room or go for a walk.  This time in your life will pass so don't do anything foolish like harming yourself.

50c48696b7488dc525798f3a4b51347daa	It sounds to me like this was the last straw for you.  You have likely been miserable in this marriage for awhile and have been thinking of leaving for a long time but may not have wanted to or may have needed a reason to.  He sounds pretty selfish to be going behind your back and it does sound like it is time to push him out the door.  Are you feeling relieved?  Because if you are then you have done what you needed to do for yourself and for your family.|`|mMzXeOhmaa	You were definitly NOT wrong to be upset! it was very selfish of him to do that, not tell you, and only invite himself on a vacation. Family comes first, and you said you have been mentioning a vacation for your family, then he should have tooken that as first priority. Its your decision what to do and thats something you should discuss with your husband. But do not let him make you feel like its Okay to do something like and to leave, because its not.|`|b8svqAMAaa	Well hopefully he wasn't talking in secret because he didn't want you to know that he was going to surprise you and take you after all this time.  That would suck.  Are you sure he was going without you?  Too bad you couldn't have told him that you heard him talking and see what excuse he came up with.  Hopefully it all works out.  Good luck.|`|74510bb10967e6ce38ca91ebb05bcc12aa	am sorry, but for all you know, he might be going there with someone else than you. he should have mentioned it, becoz he didnt he is probably was goin to lie to you.. what a jerk! make him suffer for it..|`|RF07iThiaa	You were right he doesn't care he didn't take into consideration your feelings so you need to go to counseling and if you feel like you need to divorce him by all means do so.|`|4POGapREaa	Yet another relationship where nothing is ever discussed.  Just day in & day out & don't worry about it until it comes up.  Why the F did you not know that your husband was planning a vacation in Mexico without you or your kids?  Talk to him much?  Care what he's thinking much or where he's at?  Or are you just on auto drive right now?  Who doesn't know this about their husband?  If my husband was planning on going anywhere, we would be talking about it, so why you're out of the loop is totally beyond me.  This would never just randomly happen in my relationship.  And then your fix for it is to kick him out of your house?  Ever wonder why he doesn't tell you sh!t?  You're obviously on a total disconnect & your problems go way deeper than a vacation.|`|O36qjj7Oaa	You did the right thing.<br>  <br>  If he didn't mention the trip to you then it sounds like he is up to no good.|`|fMEypXDYaa	Just divorce him and move on with your life, he has been having a affair for awhile and his mom has been helping him with it, so it is pretty plain that your not the 'beloved daughter in law',that you thought you was, nor the beloved wife either, so focus on your life and take care of the daughters.|`|JH6oCuUZaa	Well you need to talk to him and find out what is going on in his head.....right now the only information ou have is his actions but nothing about his feelings or motivations......so how can you make a choice without all of the information.  Talk to your husband calmly and without anger and just get his side of things....once you have all the information sit down and figure out your best course of action.  Do not react from emotion alone.|`|DS21ekeJaa	If you've been married for 8 years, he knew you well enough to know that this would force you to end things.

I'm so sorry for you, hope you two can figure this out.|`|xjdmXkqHaa	i think he should give you a logical honest explanation on why he was going on a vacation without your knowledge in case there was some misunderstanding over the phone conversation. <br>  if HIS REASONS SOUND BEYOND LAME, TELL HIM. and talk it out. esp since you two are married and have kids....kicking over this isn't going to solve the problem.|`|XPPGphLbaa	Obviously, if your husband was leaving for Mexico without telling you, your marriage is over.

May be, you could have spoken to him frankly and found out the reasons he had to say.  <br>  <br>  I agree that you must not allow anyone to hurt your feelings.  So, you could have found out what is the vacation he is talking about, with whom he is going to Mexico and why he had chosen to keep this as a secret from you.  <br>  <br>  It is essential to know what sort of relationship you had been living for 8 years.  A break cannot happen so suddently.  More so, when you have 2 daughters.  Your husband must be equally loving his children and is he planning to abandon them?<br>  <br>  Please be calm, think rationally, make attempts to reach your husband and talk to him, if possible involve your/his family members to interfere.  Talk to your husband's friends, employers and find out the reasons for his strange attitude.  <br>  <br>  May be, you might have overreacted to the situation.  Put your best efforts to find out the correct causes.  May be he is just wanting to be away for few days and would come back, energetic.  <br>  <br>  I sincerely hope everything gets back to normal.  Please share more information so that proper advise can be given.  Best wishes.|`|ebwe0Duzaa	alright, i think it was a little much to kick him out...if he really is showing that he doesnt love you and doesnt care about you, thats a different story, but if hes treating you good and hes just planning a vaction, that really doesnt sound so bad to me...why dont you just sit down and talk to him like a rational calm person and find out why he couldnt have talked to you about it and why he has been refusing to go on a vacation with you and your daughters...really i dont find to bad of a thing, unless he was going to meet another woman or something like that...oh and my mom always says how she is so unhappy with my dad and i feel so bad for her because i have not seen my dad be in any way affectionate towards her for as long as i can remember and the only reason they have and are staying together is because of me and my sis...if thats why your staying with that dude then thats a terrible reason...ive even encouraged my mom to divorce my dad...so yea i wouldnt leave him just because he was planning a little vactation of his own, i dont believe thats a good enough reason to end a relationship or to not forgive...i would only end and never forgive it if he truely does not care about you, no longer shows affection, treats you badly and so on...dont get too mad over his little planning because really its not so bad, you just need to talk to him calmly and try not to be mean cause it might make him feel defensive or something and make him not want to talk.  ask your self some stuff if your really thinking bout making a really big deal about it and everythin...do you love him?  is there more good times than bad?  does he treat you good?  does he show affection?  why do you love him?...maybe he was going to take off because he needed to be on his own and get away for a little bit, just a break...?

BI1Ma4vVaa	It's definately possible. It happens all the time. If you don't love the guy don't marry him. If you are unsure if you love him, don't marry him. If you do love him, Marry him.|`|ljpBWNMPaa	yeah, it's possible. Sadly..|`|d4onpzSaaa	My brother and his wife were married for 10 years, and she fell out of love. It is possible.|`|IPS3hWweaa	Yes, its possible, but more importantly, it can actually happen at any time. Even you can never tell what your heart will suddenly do.|`|8bTder08aa	Yes.  My husband and I have been friends with several couples that fell out of love/grew apart after 5+ years.  It happens.  Especially likely to happen in couples that got together when they were very young, or in people whose attraction went up like a rocket and who moved very fast, not giving themselves a chance to get to know each other.  <br>  <br>  If it's over, it's over, and the best thing you can do is admit it to your intended.  The quicker you get the truth out in the open, the quicker both of you can move on.
zFJKNKSSaa	well, if you agree to sleeping over he might get the idea that you do want sex|`|57GBEHzLaa	i say if he asks go for it, but if he doesnt then just go anyways cuz it sounds like it would be sooo much fun. but from what your saying, it sounds like he will ask you. for safety dont drink and drive! jus thought i had to say that<br>  <br>  good luck and hoped i helped<br>  =)|`|DcrI9zmkaa	If it's a choice of staying the night or driving drunk, stay the night; however, if you can make your way home safely, do so.|`|gRXngD9aaa	Safer to spend the night.  If you don't want to get laid, then just tell him up front.  This soon, he won't mind.|`|FCiuFPenaa	If you feel comfortable enough to trust this guy then go for it. I would not make it obvious that you PLANNED on him asking you to stay, but when he does, just go with your gut feeling.|`|736f4c2d0f80c01ae125e1a7f95e6540aa	It sounds like the party is cool, and your an adult.  While you definitely don't need to be caught drinking, since you are only 20, be careful.  Do not, however take mass transit, or a cab while drunk.  You are not aware enough of your surroundings, and at night, drunk or sober, being alone in town is not the best of ideas for women.  If you don't want to put yourself in the position where you MAY have sex, then see if you can stay over with a girlfriend nearby.<br>  <br>  If you do decide to stay with him, depending on your parent's social ideals, I would keep that one on the down low.  And how close do you know him?  Did you know him before you started dating?  In the end only you can decide, but I would definitely urge you not to take public transit or a cab.|`|lK3TXGBOaa	i think you shouldnt i mean you both will be drunk youll probly say yes then what happens you guys could end up having sex....i say go with a friend who has a car that can taake you back home.... oh and staying at a guys house who you just met is WRONG!|`|3Dfqwodhaa	ur bribing us to say stay at his house cuz that one is more in ur favor. yes stay at his place that nite if he invites u<br>  <br>  mine?<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=ArlHgjJH2uFq5uh7eb2QFHTsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090308193013AAftqHz">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>

Whatever the reason may be, tell them that as their daughter your fiancé deserves their support and their respect in anything she chooses to do and that if they dont want to come to the wedding for you, at least come for her. If theyre not willing to make that sacrifice for their child, then they arent very good parents and you're probably better with them out of your married life. <br>  <br>  It's really beyond me why they'd hate you so much, could be something as ridiculous as the fact that you're taking their daughter away.|`|ddXDh7rCaa	I think you need to sit down with your fiancees family and find out what reasons they have for not liking you.  You don't only marry the girl, you marry the family as well.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	That's their loss. Some people are just bitter with no reason. Don't even worry about them and plan your wedding to share with those who do love you.|`|o6xLWwZvaa	F*ck them. Who cares. Remember, its your and your fiance's wedding. No one elses. Yes its nice to have parents, relatives and friends that we want and love at our wedding. But if those people are going to be a$$holes about it, then screw them. Get married, they don't have to come.|`|HzkRpjhEaa	It is possible that they will calm down as time goes by, and realize that they are threatening to risk this once in a lifetime event that means the world to their daughter.  It is also possible they will just be too damn stubborn, in which case there is nothing you can do.  There may be deeper issues here, such as a disagreement between your fiance and her parents.  If that is the case, encourage her to talk it out with them until things get better.|`|f1de2e7e6c3445e8601e1d2bd92cd759aa	Don't push it with them.  There's obviously some issues that they haven't come to terms with.  Or they are just upset because they see you as taking away their daughter.  They may think they'll never see her again.  That's an overreaction, but it may be what's bothering them.<br>  <br>  Give them time.  Go ahead with wedding plans.  Let them in on things.  Make sure it's very clear when and where the wedding will be.  And make sure they know, even if they don't like it, that they will be included if they ever want to be.<br>  <br>  If you do that, then your fiance will feel better with you, and it can never be said that you didn't make the effort and put your best foot forward.  After that, it's on them.<br>  <br>  I wish you the best with your wedding!!!|`|c55O7jqXaa	Well I would come right out and ask them why they don't like you and why they don't want to come. I don't think this is a good way to start our a marriage having inlaws that don't like you? Maybe they feel you are taking their son away? Feel their son can do better? Something you said or did or didn't do? Whatever it is you need to settle this before marrying.|`|db67c0941f0845d64edf1a84aa913e6aaa	My fiance's mom HATES me too.

010e19f149ca4d52d45d1e56e06050e1aa	A bit of both. The girl needs to be friendly enough and teasing enough to prove to the guy that she likes him (back), yet it's also a good thing for many guys to have that 'challenge' of trying to catch her. It's a line that must carefully be walked, anyways.|`|nnQhkhhsaa	I like easy girls becuz at least u can get them b4 ur feelings and denial gets in the way of actually deciding if she's worth going out with, but if the girl is playing hard 2 get and makes it obvious that she like me i'd b willing 2 play along for a while|`|To5mQxOPaa	easy.|`|XasLRQnXaa	easy, i'm not gonna hurt myself trying to chase her.|`|1MnNVa8qaa	when she makes you hard to get. easy is never going to last. it not worth it in the end. there is nothing to wonder about when its easy. its just layed out for you. what the fun in that. i mean have you ever like a girl more when shes easy or hard to get? did it ever work with the one who was easy. make yourself hard to get.|`|nwRforaZaa	define easy. if a guy thinks the girl is easy and flirts with everyone then the answer is no. if shes difficult for EVERY little thing and chance she has then its annoying. but being difficult isn't bad much cause its makes it not boring and is semi-intersing to see how u handle conflict|`|w7HWpFxjaa	in the middle.<br>  cuz she cant be like one of those girls that you tell them you like them and the automatically like you back but if i like a girl and they keep denying  me then i get mad|`|shpzCyU3aa	i think i would like a girl who would be hard to get but not a girl who is going to be snobby about it that just makes me lose intrest.|`|AmPQYTC3aa	I've never thought about this.

ub2Dtzn0aa	When you decide to quit playing games and be more mature. The games are SOMETIMES cute at the beginning but after awhile they are played out and you have to be mature enough to be upfront and honest, i.e. be yourself.|`|AA11376151	this will end up with you being alone cuz you passed up a great guy who liked you two...now what you need to do is call him and tell him you like him that way you'll end up happy w/ the man that loves you back<br>  easy math|`|TlwWtoMXaa	Tell him the truth and talk it out and say what you feel its the only way you two will figure things out. tell him the truth.<br>  good luck.<br>  -Linda|`|izBsVtXJaa	well you can surely change it by going to him face to face and talk to him or else if you do nothing just pray for a miracle|`|CwXe7OgIaa	Sorry you asked for whats happening, you wanted to play kiddie games and it back fired on you, better luck next time. But learn from your mistakes.|`|Jn09Cruqaa	Take your white pant and write "Sorry baby, I like you" and send to him... <br>  Why don't you say you like him? You asked for it|`|lISrOzyraa	why did you say no? time heals all pain sweety|`|wfbf44rUaa	lol yr Crazy<br>  go call him be 4 u lose him :(|`|0LqslIMLaa	Alright, here's the deal. A guy will almost NEVER ask you if you like him if he's not already interested in you. By saying No, you've basically said "No, quit pursuing me, were only friends, you'll waste your time on me." Even if thats not true, thats what he now thinks. He's probably hurt, doesn't wanna see you right now because you hurt him. Now he is only gonna view you as a friend, and will move on to pursuing someone who may give him a chance.<br>  <br>  But heres the kicker, you do like him. If you told him no, you shot yourself in the foot and thats a seriously not cool thing to do to a guy, he may be annoyed or upset that you did that and hurt him even if he does find out you do like him. I have no idea why you'd tell him no but that is the most foolish thing you could of done, never do this to a guy, you'll almost surely lose him.<br>  <br>  To solve the problem, go up and just tell him "I do like you, I just was caught in the moment and was afraid to tell you. I do like you, wanna go out sometime?" And waste no time, get in contact with him ASAP or your window of opportunity will close.|`|2LDGlA1Paa	You lied to him, how can you expect this to have a good ending?<br>  <br>  Learn your lesson and stop telling lies .... especially when it can hurt someone's feelings so badly.  It's not "cute" to play games with people's emotions, it's cruel and selfish.<br>  <br>  (Guess I can forget having you pick my answer as best, huh?)|`|AA10831821	That's just mean.  I think you got what you deserved.  You had a perfect chance to get him, but you blew it.  Playing hard to get is one thing, but you didn't know when to stop.|`|U5mYBXA2aa	jeeesh women|`|oLwj5cbWaa	you need to get up and go talk to him!!! tell him the truth! It is so obivious he likes you!|`|vaZ2qMQ7aa	Uh.  Please slap yourself for me.

I did some mistake with the friend, I was mad because he did not called for a long time and when he called, was acting jealous and I was mad and I told him a lie, that I was going with the friend.  Some time that back fire on you.  I never had a chance to talk to him again.  It sucks.|`|BI1Ma4vVaa	Well your first mistake was telling him you don't like him. His ego is probably bruised and guys, like most people, don't like their egos getting injured. <br>  <br>  The way I see it you have two options One- you tell him upfront that you like him and hope he still likes you back or Two- you deal with your emotions and hope he comes around and ask you again so you can say yes, which is unlikely.<br>  <br>  I suggest option one.|`|1TrRrWMLaa	Never tell a guy you don't like him when you really do they will usually forget about you and move on. All it does is hurt him and you. It hurts you more because you really do like him. That was not a very bright move on your part. Learn from this.|`|ThfHrcc4aa	Well when a guy asks a girl if he likes her and she says no then you have broken his heart completely. I don't think he'll speak to you in awhile.|`|x2Q5Cbbpaa	you sure ****** up<br>  why didnt you just tell him you liked him<br>  he obviously likes you if he asked you in the first place.

03rggPF2aa	if theyre in college it could be the "freshman 15" or it could be birth control.|`|ec61646a044b4f75c5be95b80814be00aa	It's called college. College = lots of beer and pizza.|`|AA10246871	Well, there's the famed "Freshman 15", which refers to the weight gain most people experience in college, especially if they are not living at home. Beer, pizza, and eating a lot of junk, coupled with a not-terribly-healthy life-style tend to do that.<br>  <br>  There's also the matter, with women, of hormones. Despite the fact that most girls start having their periods somewhere around 11-13, their hormones don't really become regulated until their late teens or early 20s. That's why women who don't take the pill often have tremendously irregular periods, lots of pain, weird bleeding, etc., until they get to that period of their lives. Yes, they can get pregnant earlier, and usually everything is in fine working order, it's just that the hormones don't really regulate themselves until then. As soon as the hormones are very regular, they signal the body that it's time to have a baby, and one of the ways the body signals that is by adding weight. I know women who didn't change their diet, and who exercise regularly, and were suddenly mystified by that weight gain. It's just the body's way of saying, "Okay, time to get to baby making!"<br>  <br>  The metabolism hasn't slowed. If the woman keeps up the same habits she's always had (be they healthy or otherwise), her metabolism shouldn't change drastically at that age. It's all hormonal. It's no coincidence that the complete regulation of the menstrual system usually happens then, as well as the weight gain, because they are tied together. <br>  <br>  Women, like men, don't have metabolisms which start to slow until they hit their 30s. And when that happens, they do tend to gain a bit more weight, but it also tends to respond more readily to life-style changes than the extra pounds do at around 20, because it is related to metabolism, rather than hormones. Don't get me wrong--the hormones are raging at around 30--the body is yelling at you to have a baby, especially if you haven't had one. The next time that happens is around 40, when the body is literally screaming, "Have a baby now! It's going to be too late pretty soon." I know because I have no kids, and I had insane baby hunger around 30, which my doc explained to me, and now that I am 41, I am having it again. I asked her if it was early menopause, and she said no, it's my body telling me I am running out of time to safely have a baby without a lot of complications. It's quite annoying, really.<br>  <br>  I don't think you're being sexist--clearly you are curious. Be super supportive of your friends, especially the female ones. That's a mystifying time, and the extra weight, especially in our screwed up society, can have adverse effects on their self-esteem. Let them know they're still fun, cute, and very worthy of good men. It's nice to hear it from a girlfriend, but to a lot of women, it means a bit more coming from a guy friend.<br>  <br>  Take care.<br>  <br>  Oh! Almost forgot. Hormones are part of the reason why it's so hard for women to lose baby weight after having a kid. It's better for their body, especially if they are nursing, to have extra fat stores. It's fine for celebrities to be back at their pre-baby weight six weeks after they deliver, but they have the help of personal chefs and personal dieticians and personal trainers, and the time to use all to advantage. Most women don't have that. That's why I'd like to slap men when I hear them whine about how their wives haven't lost that last 10 baby pounds. The man didn't gain all the weight, and doesn't have to nurse, so I figure he's got a lot of nerve to b**** about something which just happens naturally when a woman has a baby--her body is fighting her at every step. She absolutely does not need him making her feel worse.|`|eAIapfXsaa	I think part of it is probably that they don't have to exercise for an hour every day like in high school.

NqbBjS0raa	Hate is a strong word in this world. It seems harsh and cruel and biased against people in a despicable way in general. I notice all women in size and shape but shorter women are not a turn off for me or a lot of men. I am sorry you feel this way and perceive our attitude to be this segregating against you or any shorter statue women. I leave with one thought, and that is generalizing usually falls flat with statistics and numbers in the populated world. We never get good data or answers from it. We never will as long as it gets used incorrectly or is abused. So smile as we notice you somewhere, just some of these guys are too shy to make a move. Or looking for a Cinderella that doesn't exist in their fantasy minds. Some should appreciate a women who knows how to flirt and get a guy looking their way to coax him into a better move than steadfast and stuck to the floor.......|`|010e19f149ca4d52d45d1e56e06050e1aa	I don't hate short women, I don't think they will be fat (if they are a little overweight, it's what they are, and nothing to be ashamed of/hated for.)<br>  <br>  Personally, I prefer shorter women. *shrug* I really don't know what you're talking about.|`|g5hbtv4laa	How short are we talking?

Good luck.|`|zW8tc64qaa	The question is why women hate short men (who are actually of average height)? <br>  <br>  In any case, I like short women, they're usually all I go for.

390032981173faf9118ec2e5f2f30349aa	go for it! Ask both of them out, with roses just to add to the effect. Every girl loves roses. But really if you get turned down, try to move on, you win some and you loose some. Don't give up, you will have your chance or chances i promise. Another thing is, now that you know how it feels to be turned down, maybe try to find a girl who might feel the same, one who is kind of shy maybe. Im not saying you have to sleep together, get married and have babies, just take her on a date. Honestly it will raise the confidence of both of you.|`|NIYYN6tpaa	It's better to make girls want you...Be nice but don't try to hard....That always make them wonder whats up and want you even more....Girls come after me all the time.

Unless you are a real retard or super ugly or something, there are many women/girls that would love to spend time, maybe the rest of their life, with you. It's a bit like fishing.  You toss it out there. Some days you get lucky, others not. In the mean time, have a beer, hang out with your buds, enjoy life, persure your hobby/passion.

Give it time.|`|kyTBaYFlaa	Ok so when i was in elementary school i used to eat paste and there was this girl in my class who didn't eat paste but I didn't care because i didn't like her any way because she was a girl and probably had cooties.

In High School she had a boyfriend. So I beat up her boyfriend and now I don't think she likes me anymore but i still like her but I don't eat paste anymore so i was thinking about sniffing glue instead. So anyway What was your question?|`|771702cc138b8e49b58a97fac0fcaa49aa	Being sweet is over rated.  When a girl tells you that you are sweet it means you just got put into the friend zone.  Its almost impossible to get out of the friend zone most of the time.  At 17 you still have a ton of time to find someone.  Maybe in another 10 years you can start to worry if you are in the same situation.

My ex and I broke up three months ago and this past weekend she was a *****...I decided I was going to cut off contact with her for a while so I could have some piece and try to get over her. We are usually pretty good to each other but something was in the air this weekend. So she calls me tonight on her way home and says she is really tired and can't drive all the way home. So know she is sleeping in my bedroom.<br>  <br>  I am just telling you this to show you, you are not alone in your mess. I love my ex too still and am finding it really hard to get over her! I tried to cut contact before but she wasnt having any part of it. She kept calling and finding excuses to come see. It is all about games for her right now and it puts me in a bad place emotionally! I finally told her I had enough and I dont wanna deal with her if she was gonna play games!<br>  <br>  If your ex calls you or tries to contact you somehow. Be as happy as you can! Even if your not! you need to get across to him that you can move on in your life and be happy without him! You will see a big difference in his attitude if you can maintain this. If you do end up trying to work things out with him, take it really slowly and make sure you guys work out whatever the issue was that broke you apart in the first place.|`|t0JAocJdaa	Well you jumped the gun with breaking it off with him, just because you have a feeling doesn't mean it will happen. Just phone him up and tell him you were foolish and are really sorry and that you were scared and over reacted and with a little luck yous will be back together in no time|`|ITucJoZ4aa	why'd you break up?|`|uWcYXeeTaa	I'm going through the same thing right now. Basically, it's the worst feeling in the world. It's cliche, but that moment when you're about to delete his number from your phone is both awful and confusing, and empowering and liberating.  Before you delete his number from your cell, block his number.  Also, delete him from any social networking website (myspace, facebook, etc) as well as email contact.  It may feel like you're taking extreme measures, but in the end, you will be better off and happy that you officially and successfully cut off all ties of communication.  <br>  <br>  Next, and only when you feel ready (but you should never feel 100% comfortable, then you know it's too late), you should discard any songs, posters, movies, objects-- anything!-- that reminds you of him, your relationship, that time in your life, etc.  Again, it may sound drastic, but it's effective. <br>  <br>  When you feel yourself wanting to cry or crawl into a hole, go ahead. it's your grieving process. you've lost a large portion of yourself and your heart and it's not easy to mend. i understand. i know what it's like to find yourself in the early hours of the morning wanting to call him just to talk, i know what it's like to look at your bed and remember him there.  to say this is tough is an understatement.  unfortunately, you have to put your head down, gather some courage and step back out there stronger and wiser.  maybe in a few years, once you've re-established a healthy life without him, and you don't find yourself compulsively thinking of him, the two of you will reconnect somehow and become friends. until then, rent some movies and get some ice cream or chocolate, (and then go to the gym!)  cry, laugh, hate him, do whatever it takes. i know you'll start to feel better soon.
jcpem8Cwaa	Welll, <br>  I would honestly start talking to some of his friends.<br>  you start to get to know the people he hangs out with, <br>  and get to the point where your sitting with his friends and always hanging out with him you INSTANTLY start hanging out with him.<br>  <br>  it works(:
fd76fcf7d987df9779f858fbf3501206aa	This one bad boy, womanizer tricked me into thinking he liked me and then stopped contacting me after 3 dates.  Later I found out he did this to other women who didn't want to have sex with him.  Those who did have sex with him remained his "friend" even though he had also had a steady girlfriend at the same time.  <br>  <br>  I should have took the hint, but I still stupidly kept in contact with him for another 3 months although he barely contacted me.  I eventually took him off my IM and cut contact with him.  He then spread rumors about me to his gf and other girls on the side, and they stopped talking to me.  I was friends with them also.<br>  <br>  He eventually married his gf, but their marriage dissolved after 2 months.  What's funny is his gf still keeps in contact with him and has his other girls on the side visit her house.  He also still visits her house.  I know this b/c his girls on the side started talking to me again after he married his g/f.<br>  <br>  Funny thing is, after he divorced, he's started contacting me again.  However, I keep myself busy and rarely see him anymore, except when there are group outings.  Oh well, don't want a man-ho anyway.|`|USn04b4Paa	most are dead or in jail|`|TNjKwlA9aa	Well, I'm dating a bad boy right now. We've been together for 4 years.

For example " just calling to make sure you made it in alright, i was worried because i had not heard from you" that way you are letting her know you were just concerned, which is a good thing!!|`|XMZ54FLJaa	Don't call. Sometimes your just caught up in the moment that you forget to call. It's not a big deal and it's definitely not worth getting an argument over.

If he really likes u n thinks your cute he'll just be happy to be making out with u and not thinking how good you are at it.|`|q2H9jgDSaa	it really just comes naturally.<br>  you'll know when it happens.<br>  just go with the flow.<br>  <br>  P.S.<br>  brush the teeth<br>  and use chap stick.<br>  :)|`|6846a3395d16d18b95b001a1bda626a1aa	Kiss him the way you feel and suddenly it will no longer be a question of how.  Making out is a kissing marathon so take it slow, make it sensuous and if there is a warm wind blowing the stars around, the earth may move.|`|AXj4OnZBaa	It's like an extended kiss! it's difficult to explain, but trust me-- you WILL figure it out, probably within about 2 seconds. good luck :)|`|pwcEvd4taa	just go for it i didnt know how either but wen it came afterwards he told me "damn ur a good kisser i was like wat the hell?|`|9OUbBswXaa	This is sad...|`|HE56Jra6aa	Let him kiss you first... then move on from there.|`|F0sJR0jbaa	Lol this sounds kind of sweet.  Start with a regular kiss and then slowly slip your tongue through his lips.  Then all you have to do is gently caress his tongue with yours.  Don't be a dead kiss use tongue and have fun with it.  Its hard to describe how to do it and its kind of a big step.  But just relax and have fun!|`|2J1Ca4Bbaa	When you make out with someone you just go with the flow, it's a natural instinct.  You already know how to do it when it happens :)<br>  Don't stress over it.|`|eFeRODh3aa	Its one of those things that you just kind of now how to do.<br>   haha <br>  you wont screw up follow his lead and you'll be fine!|`|lQ57i2cOaa	just play with each others tongue i think.... i mean thts how i do it w girls|`|XU9kfVmKaa	experiment with him you'll get the hang of it in no time it came to me naturally|`|yGptFfnaaa	hmm same question|`|YUgBySaNaa	trust me, you'll be fine...it just comes to you.<br>  but make sure not to bite him!|`|dxfA5F4zaa	<a href="http://www.cosmogirl.com/guys/guide-to-guys/master-the-make-out" rel="nofollow">http://www.cosmogirl.com/guys/guide-to-g...</a> <-- best one<br>  <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Make-Out-for-the-First-Time" rel="nofollow">http://www.wikihow.com/Make-Out-for-the-...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.howdoyoumakeout.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.howdoyoumakeout.com/</a>|`|RLiDpSf8aa	all you have to do is like.. grow some balls right?|`|uSII6ucJaa	You'll do fine it comes natural.
NqbBjS0raa	I guess you will have to test that close up chemistry and see if you get more good vibes from her or still get turned on by the bf. I see how this gets complicated but do you best to test the waters here. (check both and see how much you excite them and they do you. Base it on how you do them and they do you. May the best the best soaking win out to know the chemistry reaction on the good natural sex) It usually gives good indicators of close up people connections and being into each other......(In more ways than one)|`|VTGm3UNBaa	Date the girl, if that doesnt work then date your best friend. OR date your best friend. Just remember friends make the best lovers, or the worst breakups, Youll be taking a big chance. Thats why i say date the girl first. You never know.<br>  <br>  If you don't know whether he likes you ask him? Let him know your interested and if he's interested then there you go. <br>  <br>  You sound young. Don't fret about it too much. Life moves on|`|h0ZdSxQiaa	choose one a but make sure that the person is really the you want and person is serious about you!! your bestfriend btw maybe a player!! he might like you but he doesnt wanna tell you i mean you're obviously cute! but then again its really up to you who you think your heart beats for!!|`|jFCA0Pwcaa	if you dont want people to know then dont go out with the girl o.O<br>  just be there fer ur bestie and he might return the feelings|`|hGvOwXTTaa	jus do wat u gta do unless the chick is fat n looks like a guy long story but jus wit wat ur heart tells u it worked for me|`|pPZv2tTQaa	With the guy friend I would suggest distancing your-self from him a little.  I know that would suck cause hes your best friend but it's a good idea.  Your feelings will hopefully settle down in a bit for him. <br>  With your ex, it depends on why you broke up.  Can your problems with him be fixed?  Are you actually in love with him or are you just sexually attached?  I know this sounds silly but wright a list of why you are perfect for each-other and why you are totally wrong for each-other.  If your feeling stronger for someone else you'll only sabotage the relationship because you'll be thinking about that 'other' person.  The person you are with might not know everything but they will notice your heart is not fully in it.<br>  That other girl is the most complicated one.  It's very common for girls to be emotionally and sexually open to other girls.  Often times after they try it they realize that they could never permanently be with a girl and it was really nothing more then a crush.  As you get older you will understand that a 'crush' is nothing more then a fleeting fancy and not to really even pay attention to it.  The easiest way to discern a crush from a real interest is to think about why you are into them.  Are the reasons more then just a first impression?  Is there real value?  Think about what you would need in a relationship and think about if you Know enough about the person to know if they can give you that.   <br>  Some people you LOVE being with and it's just as friends.  The following is a series of tests to see if your really really into the girl they may be weird but humor me.  Think about the girl.  Do you want her hands all over your body?  Do you want your hands touching every part of hers?  Do you want to kiss her?  Do you want her tong on your body and yours on hers?  Do you want to get naked with her and do what ever it is girls do when they have sex with each other?  If your answer to all of these are yes then you are probably pretty turned on and then you are well and truly bi.  Hopefully your not freaked out.<br>  Anyhow if your feeling strongly for multiple people you really need to pick one and try to distance your self from the rest.  Possibly if you distance yourself from your best friend a little he might come to you.  A better way to attract his attention is to dress suggestively around him.  Don't be obvious and make sure being with him is worth possibly loosing him.  Might I suggest seeing if hes willing to be cuddle-buddies.  You'll get some physical contact but not enough to risk or ruin your friendship.  Invite him over, put in a movie, then sit with your back on his arm a little.  If he moves away maybe be more forceful.  put his arm around your solder, put your head on his chest and then put your hand on his peck.  <br>  I know that's a crazy tone of information but with so many directions you could possibly go it was hard to be brief.  If you have anymore questions or want me to be more detailed in a specific direction, e-mail me.

Just Google it.|`|DcrI9zmkaa	It isn't short enough to post, as the "Love Dare" is an entire book.  It's co-written by Alex and Steven Kendrick, and you can find it online or in Christian bookshops.|`|wHgBnMipaa	I am pretty sure you have to find the book, actually!  They sell it on Amazon.com.
m7WiyFQ3aa	Tell them to f*@k off. That is disrespectful.|`|0fcwsv7Vaa	Kick him in the....
0LqslIMLaa	He's probably just trying to be safe and scare you into not cheating, I did a similar thing but never would of done anything (in fact she did cheat on me and I didn't) but its more of a re-assurance. Don't cheat, but be careful, he may get jealous easily, but it may just be nothing.<br>  <br>  But if he does become abusive or anything, get out the first time he touches you out of violence.|`|AA11231327	If you're 100% you wouldn't cheat, then I honestly wouldn't worry about it..I think he was just talking out of his a*s to scare you into not cheating. But, if he keeps throwing signs out there of violence...leave him. But you said that he isn't violent..and doesn't have a temper. Soooo, I think it was just talktalktalk lol|`|ZJB24VtRaa	Sounds like he has some issues. Tell him that you would never cheat. Reassure him that you like him. You have to be open and honest to make things work out. As for him, he needs to get over his issues and learn to trust you.|`|AcIv8SeXaa	this dude is an idiot. if hed actually do it then hes a dumb ***. if he would NOT do it then hes a punk *** that talk s trash and doesn't do **** i bet hes the kinda guy who starts a fight and then gets his *** kicked or just backs down  either way hes a fool|`|N0EHtPKsaa	he's most likely a big protective talker, but not so much otherwise.... you should ask him just how serious he was, and if he'd ever lift a hand to you. if he would, you gotta dump the one who's got trust issues shug.|`|i3bjUCVJaa	Maybe he's been hurt like that before and doesn't want to go through it again. Sounds like he has trust issues.|`|oLwj5cbWaa	oh god, those are signal that he needs anger management! dump him before he hits you! those are huge signals!|`|abprPtCxaa	he loves u so much.....so,he is a b posesive tat's al dear....|`|8bc1f8bfc8a1aa2294bf623bd7b1ccaaaa	A lot of guys DON'T say that. Are you serious?<br>  <br>  You are acting like the things he said are normal. That is so far from normal it is not even funny. My god if some guy said that to me, and it put me off, I would take it as a sign. If it put you off, it is your gut telling you to GET OUT.<br>  <br>  Or you can stay with him, and hope he doesn't kill you. <br>  It doesn't matter if you wouldn't cheat. If he thinks of you that way, as someone to smack around when you do something he doesn't like, then he is going to eventually do it anyway, whether you cheated or not. He'll do it for some other reason. Or maybe none at all. <br>  Take it from someone who's been there.<br>  <br>  I can't believe people are telling you to 'talk to him' about this. What he has said to you is a HUGE red flag, and talking to him about it will NOT predict when he will hit you in the future.|`|n4faz3Gyaa	it sounds pretty abusive if he admitted that he would abuse you, and it might mean he doesnt trust you|`|MXpW48lFaa	Tell him how you feel. About the hitting thing. Tell him "If you would hit me if I cheated, could it mean you would hit me now...when we are in an argument?". Then tell him, that you love him and that you are totally committed to him. Just tell him :)|`|AA11627920	dont cheat and you wont have a problem  :D|`|TT43pWMlaa	Whoa! Nice by! You should also say that if you caught him with any girl, you broke up with him. But, we have to be honest, right? And I think your by just want you to be honest. There's no people who want to do that just for love. But, Romeo and Juliet does. (Laugh out loud)|`|DwiQ66qyaa	that's just his style. that's how he talks. if you don't like it, find someone else or tell him to knock it off<br>  <br>  someone please help me|`|qDWuMuwZaa	it means he loves you very much. so behave, don't make him jealous.|`|s564PQUHaa	that's a sign of no trust. watch it
AA10831821	First, you need to figure out your feelings for your current boyfriend.  If you are no longer in love with him, you must dump him.  If you still feel there is something there, give him another chance.  If you decide to dump him, move forward with caution.  Schedule your first dates with the online guy in public places and wait a while before visiting his home.  I know you trust him, but with people you meet online, it is better to be safe than sorry.|`|0ky4TktEaa	No worries. I've been there and i understand what you mean. I think before you jump into things with this new guy though, reevaluate your relationship. You said you feel like you aren't that close anymore and that you spend more time apart than you used to even when you're physically near each other. Be honest about whether or not you feel like working on that. If you used to have an amazing connection with your boyfriend and think that it can be found again with a bit of work, do that. If you think it's gone out or that you've put in enough work and are tired of no results, let your boyfriend know the deal. I wouldn't go into detail much about this internet guy because you've been cheating to a certain degree and that's wrong. The fact that you only started talking to him because you were trying to fill a void that your boyfriend wasn't taking care of is wrong too. I think you need to give it a shot with this new guy. However, even so, don't jump into anything serious. You need to get to know him in person first.|`|1ZuF9FdSaa	1st, I'm polyamorus, so my opinion is going to come from a whole different paradigm than most people.  I think that it's completely natural to get on a "downward slope" from time to time in a relationship.  Relationships are relations between people.  People are dynamic beings, so why shouldn't their relationships be dynamic as well?   We don't stay who we are now, we are always developing and changing.  So you met someone new who appeals to you.  I mean, you didn't really meet him, you've been chatting online.  He might be real or he might be just acting to try and get with you.  Heck, YOU might be acting to try and get with HIM.  <br>  <br>  From a monogamous perspective, the right thing to do is to talk to your b/f before you get as involved as you are with this internet guy.  Being honest is really important.<br>  <br>  From a poly perspective, you should have already discussed your feelings and let him know what was going on.  Again, key factor here is honesty.  Don't let your fear bully you into being deceitful and betraying the trust of someone you supposedly care about.|`|Kv345W51aa	That's why people cheat, other people show interest and place more importance on that person than their significant other does. But how long would that last with the new guy you haven't met yet... and are you just feeling like that about him because it's an online thing. Maybe you should meet this guy and see how you feel then. But you should definitely inform your boyfriend that you're not happy, especially since you've been with him for so long. You wouldn't want to keep him from anything. Good luck with that hun!
R5hcAgwLaa	just have some guts and be honest for christs sake, man up little girl|`|392b18ae97259a7518f51868eb7ea463aa	Know that if he truly cares about you then he will hear you out and understand where you are coming from. The best way is to be honest. Don't add too much fluff. He will see right through it and that will only make things worse. Elaborate on the reasons that you want to break up with him in more detail and give him examples to ensure that he understands. Assure him that nobody else is in the picture and that nobody else has come between the two of you. Let him know that your reasons for breaking up with him are your own: personal and the product of changing over the course of the relationship. Make sure that you tell him that the two of you gave love a fair shot and in life, there is nothing more that two people can do. In your case, the two of you grew apart.<br>  <br>  Wishing the two of you only the best. And remember, don't make it out to be more than it is. It is better to realize that things didn't work out between the two of you sooner rather than later (after the knot has been tied). As hard as it may be, see the good in everything.|`|At8D5Xu2aa	You've been in a relationship that you haven't wanted to be in for a YEAR????????<br>  <br>  Sugar, break it off!  You need to tell him that it's not working.  You can't not hurt him.  It's as simple as that.|`|XO7Dmtlvaa	You need to end it. Leading him on isn't fair. You need to sit him down and say that you really care about him, but you're young (or are you?) and you want to see what else is out there. You had so many amazing memories over the year(s) but it's just not right for you anymore.|`|8VtqxobDaa	shoot him in the head there will no pain.|`|wxjOF9lRaa	no dont wait just tell him u dont luv him and come back 2 r ex babe

CCAw6XLtaa	my suggestion is to have a talk with him about how hes changed(im sure you already have and he made the claim "no ill never change i love you baby you know that") which leaves you confused and you dont know if hes telling the truth or not because you already see him changing. so there for if he fosent shape up soon you should probably cut it off before you get to hurt unless your willing to ride the emotional rollercoaster hes gonna lay out for you. do what your heart says i hope to you th best of luck.|`|1iXvphNYaa	Tell your boyfriend how you feel. Of course, if you're both 15 I don't think you'll have much luck chaning his mind. If he doesn't change his mind then thats to say he'd rather be thought of as cool rather than be your boyfriend, as if that wasn't cool enough. Maybe the best thing that could happen to you is to lose him. Good luck. Chin up. Smiles. :)|`|zW8tc64qaa	Seems like something that needs to be worked out between you and your boyfriend. Sit down and talk to him about it. That's one of the best ways to get to him. <br>  <br>  Sometimes, you have to rely on trust in order for a relationship to survive. If there is no trust, then what else is there? I understand where you're coming from, but you have to trust each other.|`|HQb4wL1Eaa	be honest. Tell him you do not like the way he has been acting and you do not think you can be with him if he does not go back to the way he was when you met him. People change and since you guys are young change is inevitable. He is going to grow into the person he is going to be and whether you like it or not he is gonna change. Your young so if it does not work out there will be another guy you will meet and you will be just fine.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good Luck<br>  Honesty is key to a good relationship|`|ULkqriEhaa	Since you are so young - i'd suggest just letting the relationship go. Boys at this age aren't ready to be mature yet even if you are. If he is that easily influenced by others, he's just not worth it. If he's crazy about being around this guy more than you, then give him a bottom line, say you aren't comfortable with his behavior, tell him it's dangerous and it's making you feel upset and unloved.<br>  <br>  But really, you can do better, you are so young and will meet so many amazing people in life. I know it hurts to leave someone, but it's going to cause you so much distress.|`|s4602TSBaa	If that's the road your bf chose, then there is not much you can do about it, unfortunately. Maybe he's just too young to spend all his time with his girlfriend. Don't pressure him cause you'll only make him like you less. If his behavior persists (and you are not OK with it) then just leave him. That friend cannot totally change him if he doesn't want to, so not everything is the friends fault. I am sorry, but as I said, there is not much you can do in this situation.<br>  <br>  Good Luck

AA11001595	There's an art to picking up girls.<br>  <br>  Let's put it this way, you have a 100% better chance getting her interested in you by going up to her and starting a conversation and not being afraid to fail than by semi-stalking her and thinking about it too much like you are right now. You definitely don't want to be that guy that keeps looking at her every bus ride, hoping that one day she'll come over and talk to you.<br>  <br>  When it comes to picking up girls, there's a 3-second rule that applies. You should ideally start talking to her within 3 seconds of wondering whether you should talk to her or not. That way, you come across as open instead of creepy. Girls get uncomfortable when you keep looking at them.<br>  <br>  When you do go to talk to her, try keeping a few things in mind.<br>  <br>  1) Approach her from the front or from the font/side. Do not approach her from behind in any way. Do not startle her.<br>  <br>  2) SMILE. If you think you'll be too nervous, then practice your smile beforehand. A smile is sooo important to coming across positively.<br>  <br>  3) Set up a "time constraint." Don't allow her to think "Oh no. I'm going to be stuck talking to this guy for a while and he's not going to leave me alone until I force the issue." Free her from her fear of being uncomfortable. If you're planning on sitting near her on the bus to talk to her, start out by telling her almost from the beginning something like "My friend and I need to go over the homework for math before class so I need to go in a minute." Then keep the conversation short, light and friendly so you can talk to her again in the future with her feeling like she knows you a little. She'll be more relaxed that way. Maybe she'll even seek you out the second time.<br>  <br>  4) Have an opener ready when you do start talking to her. It doesn't have to be anything impressive. An opener is just a way for two people to start a conversation. Once the opening is over, you can talk about anything at all. Try to avoid complimenting her too much or impressing her too much at first, especially if she gets compliments from all the guys. If she generally gets a lot of attention from guys, you should try throwing a "neg" at her. Nothing too mean though. Something like "when you smile, you look a little like a buck-toothed Britney Spears." Don't make it real bad like telling her "that's an ugly sweater." There can be a fine line.<br>  <br>  5) Make sure that when you're doing all this stuff that you're being yourself as well. Some of it won't be smooth. We can't all be perfect. Hopefully, she sees what you're trying to do as sweet. You're politely coming on to her. It's ok for her to know that. Worst case scenario, it doesn't work and that's ok. That just means that you wait a couple weeks and try again or move on if she's made it clear it's a no go.<br>  <br>  If it doesn't work out, then at the very least you'll have some experience at trying to pick up girls. The next time you try, it'll be that much easier.<br>  <br>  Try reading the book below. It's a life changer, especially for people who are nervous about picking up girls.|`|4S8IKFn0aa	Hi|`|Zuqyx4tJaa	do something simple to talk to her. say "hey you can sit here" if she's looking for a seat or drop your pencil on the ground by her ad ask her (politely) to pick it up, and go from there.|`|3nO7RZr9aa	Dude, your too young.

LHzlvfRQaa	When some girls ask you back to their place, it doesn't mean for sex, it means for a coffee, so I think you misread what she was suggesting.<br>  In my opinion she likes you but just wants to start out as friends and not rush into anything either.<br>  Maybe you should just wait for her to phone you. And the only way that can happen is if you text her your phone number. Once she has your phone number don't contact her anymore. Wait for her to contact you. If she doesn't then just move on and find a girl who you can rely on to meet you for a coffee and to go places with.<br>  11pm is rather late to phone someone you hardly know. She might be asleep. Text her in the morning and leave your phone number and just leave it at that or she might think that you are pestering her.

Uz3no8awaa	it's all about how you see sex. <br>  <br>  sex ought to be a beautiful thing between two people who love each other, it's about trust and love. <br>  <br>  if your just having sex, for the sake of having sex your sort of taking the point out of it. <br>  <br>  it's not so much the age as it is about how you see sex. <br>  <br>  at your age you might not be able to see how a guy is just using you for himself, disrespecting you.<br>  <br>  who knows in a few years you might meet a guy you really likes and you might wish you had waited for him. <br>  <br>  remember its not just about std's like hpv, nor is just about how you might get pregnant, sex is an extremely important aspect of your life its not just some nothing. its how your parents will see you, you brother/sister. Your friends, the men in your life present and future including your future husband and children, sex has a lot to say about who you are, its serious stuff.|`|uLDWMzSHaa	Well basically you just pointed out whats wrong!<br>  Theres a chance of getting pregnent (and thats a whole nother story)<br>  STD's<br>  And people will see you as a slut<br>  <br>  You probley dont care now but when your applying for colleges...People can be bitches and they will try to stop you from getting into a college because they could care less about you!<br>  <br>  Anyway if you really love the guy go ahead and get down and dirty. But I dunno where you would do it I mean your parents probley dont want you to have sex but anyway find a next cozy small spot and have fun ;]<br>  Email if you need help picking out lingerie ;]<br>  O and you can email me more about the sex thing at ralphlaurenlover@yahoo.com|`|6aQi4sHeaa	Kids at 14 today don't really have the emotional stability that people around their 20s have. If a 14 year old had sex and then the guy/girl left them, its really bad to that age group and affects them emotionally (depression, regreting it, suicide etc) while the 20 year olds are alot smarter and actually know what they are doing. And alot of teens dont understan the word "protection" which screws them over.

Call a friend.|`|wHgBnMipaa	Breaking up with someone is like grieving over a death.  It is hard, very hard.  You shouldn't be alone right now, first of all.  Get a friend or family member to come to you.  If you feel like you are a danger to yourself for much longer, though, you need to call the police and they will know how to help you.|`|KU0C99muaa	i agree with kari, don't go through this alone. we've all been there before, and we've all come back from it! so don't give up, and don't blame yourself. you wont feel like this forever, trust me. keep your head up, get your mind off of it, and talk it out with a friend.

Guys or Girls who say "eff this , eff that " every word is almost a swear, then it's rude and quite embarrassing. A little swearing usually does not matter, it depends on who you are with, some people are really weird about it and are offended by it, so once someone else swears you'll know if you're in the clear.<br>  <br>  Also, NEVER ever swear around your girlfriend's parents! That's a huge no no and the girl will usually be traumatized|`|d7jd7GYjaa	It depends on the situation. It can be any.

It may not seem like it to you but she may feel differently. A girlfriend may be getting in the way too. Women/Girls tend to listen to their close friends. If the friend doesn't approve of you, she may be struggling on what to do herself. The blocking facebook could be a sign of that. I suggest that you give her some space. Stay away from her for a week or two. If she comes looking for you, then there has to be something there. If she doesn't, she's not worth your time. You would only be setting yourself up for heartache.

bfeQ3miMaa	Its everything you think.  Appearance, personality, similar likes and dislikes.  The rest of it (height, weight, chest size, blonde/brunette) is just an individual preference.  Based on your picture, I'd date you if I were younger, I'm 24, and you appear to still be in high school.|`|zW8tc64qaa	If I see that a girl is attractive, and she seems like she knows how to have a good time, can laugh (I love a girl with a sense of humor) and seems intelligent. That would make me want to date her. Yes, I'll admit that looks do count initially, but they don't take precedence over the other qualities. As for you, I would date you. You're cute :)<br>  <br>  The question is if you'd ever date me! I'm not too tall (5' 7") and I'm 18. I'm sure we can work around that lmao. Take care!|`|VRjIZKOCaa	it's a whole bunch of things combined.  Physical appearance of course is important, but personality is a very close second. <br>  <br>  The best things a girl can have is a good sense of humour. a lot of girls seem really uptight and serious all the time, no guy wants anything to do with a girl like that.  <br>  <br>  Boobs don't matter, it's just a bonus if they're there or not but it's got nothing to do with the overall attraction. <br>  <br>  Looks count for a lot.  A girl that takes pride in her appearance will win many hearts.

tZUSVuUvaa	Guys will act like they respect you for not sleeping with them, but most of them harbor a fantasy that they will be the one to get in your pants and when it doesn't happen they'll move on. There are decent guys out there though who genuinely will respect it. <br>  <br>  I'm not a guy, and I'm not against premarital sex, but I am staying celibate after a bad breakup until I am in a decent relationship again.  It's just less stressful right now.<br>  <br>  I'm guessing that you are still fairly young. I'm not going to discourage you from abstaining but I do have to agree with the other guy who answered. I don't think it's realistic to wait until marriage these days and I can't even imagine only being with one guy in my entire life. Most of the girls who pledged abstinence in high school ended up breaking that long before marrying. Do whatever works for you though.|`|74663a5149541c3116159335087c651faa	I agree with Dog, it is important part. I think alot of people and maybe yourself look at it as bad unless it's after marriage. I think that conception is judged by hearing about people who badly practice sex. It should be a respectable thing between two lovers who respect and love and are friends wih each other and many more.|`|vaZ2qMQ7aa	Personally, I wouldn't date her.  Sex is an important part of a healthy relationship.<br>  <br>  Also, if you really want to have sex, but you can't because you're waiting until marriage, then when you do get married, it will be much less meaningful.  You have no way of knowing whether it's genuine love or if you're looking for an excuse to have sex.  Sorry, but you won't be in the proper frame of mind to make that judgment.<br>  <br>  Abstinence until marriage is an archaic concept, and frankly, it is also a harmful one.
t0rOQ5FWaa	I can't be truthful right now so lets just say no i don't do that.|`|qNMfaJ4Raa	Sounds like you got married way too young, before you got all the no strings sex with skanks out of your system|`|zdQGden1aa	The flesh is weak, what else would you like to hear? If you're doing it in your mind the time will arise when you'll want to do it with the other "thing." But this is of course common sense, you didn't need me to tell you that, did you?|`|8oX0wZAIaa	You sound a bit immature to be married, but good job on 8 years. Everytime you see that girl just think about your wife: she's been by your side for 8 years, put up with you, loves you. She's better than a "cutey" who would never commit to you anyway. Who do you want: the cute girl who doesn't give a damn about you deeply, or your wife whose got your back??<br>  <br>  C'mon.|`|g6pqGjrkaa	The creation is such, and it will make others to look at opposite sex with the eye.    See No harm but before that you just imagine that if some body  keep their eyes on your sister like what  you think . don't you feel ugly.|`|OtKCAeQZaa	Remember that you choose to make that choice you can stop it any time you want.

NGyZCCo6aa	I'm sixteen and had the EXACT same thing my entire life up until five months ago when I met an absolutely amazing guy.<br>  <br>  just wait, and when you meet the right guy you'll let your guard down and fall for him even harder when he says he likes you back. I realized I acted that way was because I was hurt by my parent's divorce when I was younger and thus didn't want anyone to get too close to me.
F5V1g2Nnaa	Hmmmmm. I don't know you at all so I can't tell if she likes you or not,But I can say she is dropping BOMBS as hints to try again.Yeah...Hope it turns out well!<br>  <br>  -Amazing Me|`|tqsh9YXyaa	You should just wait for couple of more days..
e6657aae9a5e6165c0768975ea7fd38daa	OK First off here is the main problem GIRLS HAVE THE RIGHT TO CHANGE THERE MIND AT ANY GIVEN MOMENT! Plus to top it off you make yourself sound like you only want sex... most girls don't like that and its a turn off. She was probably just thinking about breaking up with him or she wanted to start some drama... Why would you just flat off go and get the stuff after she said that it was probably a test. Second YES GIRLS TEST GUYS! Every day i here about how so and so is testing if he is alright to date an what not...Just hang until she does break up with him but just stay friends fantasize if you want just don't make any hasty decisions!|`|16xFfHvuaa	OOhhh    How noble of you .<br>  What a bunch of crap!!<br>  <br>  Either you do or you don't.<br>  <br>  Who are you trying to fool?<br>  <br>  She is just having fun and doesn't really give a sh$$ about either of you.|`|W7GrERjkaa	what a friend!<br>  <br>  your a sleeze, Everyone knows your friends significant other is off limits. even if they broke up! off limits. <br>  <br>  you should back off and let them be together|`|DGnhjmOzaa	dude - she's totally ******* with you, and her "boyfriend". She has no idea what she wants. Definitely leave that alone and find someone else. It'll be good for you.|`|7yfIfQtwaa	ok thats wass way too long .. <br>  <br>  secondly i think you should just consider "having fun" with another girl! trust me its going to be way easier in the end, and then think about when ur room mate finds out things are going to get messy.. <br>  <br>  also chances are they wont brake up for a while so if i were you i would move on and see someone else <br>  <br>  but in answer to your question stop trying so hard to make up for it and dont pressure and ask her about it all the time just let it be and if she wants to have some fun with you she will tell you|`|pNcVWxMKaa	You seem like a nice guy.. So quit trying to **** your roommates girl!! that is SO messed up!!! Just because she is a slut and a drunk slut at that does NOT mean that you should take advantage of the situation!! I think that this girl is completely screwing with your head, if she wanted something with you.. she would have already done something!! This is going to come back and bite you in the *** my friend. Your roommate (and what seems like best friend) will find out and you will lose a life long friend. I've had best friends sleep with my boyfriends and it is probably the worst feeling in the entire world. Grow up. Be a man. Get a different girl!!! I'm sure you're attractive and can do better than a slutty girl that is willing to cheat on her long term boyfriend with his best friend..what a skank!|`|a1pmr73vaa	Give yourself a hand job and stop your tripping what you need to do is get a reality check when she rejects your pathetic azz!|`|Ll3Qt8Wyaa	i know right!

UrGCq6RVaa	It is so easy to be attracted to "bad boys." Especially if you are labeled as a "good girl." And for some reason, bad boys love good girls. I guess opposites really do attract.<br>  <br>  Most good guys are looking for women that are good themselves and have their stuff together. It is usually the male version of yourself and someome that you usually don't date.|`|U4yiOCGgaa	A lot of it depends on the kind of people you hang around with and how you carry yourself.  If you treat yourself well, have confidence in yourself and a positive outlook, you will generally attract more of the same type people, including a good quality guy.|`|pEsP0AWuaa	bad boys go after girls who are easy as in put out easy, so just dont put out easy|`|76652fe766b064dedfef1f9a09de248faa	im here! lol jk jk just trying to be goofy :)|`|BGOPARrTaa	do u want a good guy instead of a bad boy... well have more time with a new person u meet dont rush it take ur time.. and also dont worry and dont rush it. the right time will come.|`|V4jYQcJZaa	By "how can I attract good guys" do you mean, "I want a nice guy instead of a bad-boy?"

Like you could mention this new movie that is out and talk about that for a bit and then after a bit say, "we should see that sometime". If he likes you and isn't too shy then he might go for it.

That's the way to get things started between you two.
N7gOE1btaa	You are the weak one simply because you allow for it.  The next time someone says something to you, then just make them feel stupid.  You can do this by not throwing out a direct insult, but saying something that degrades what they said.  If they insult you, throw out the comment like 'oh ya, that was really original.'  If you try to fight back directly, you may come across as being a ******.  You just need to show your confidence and that their words don't bother you, eventually they will stop.
cXtEx98Haa	I don't know who it might be that would set limits.  <br>  <br>  If you want to go all out, arrange a truly wonderful evening, that is great.  You know the old saying "it's the first impression that's most important."  <br>  <br>  If you truly like to make girls feel special and like to put thought into your dates with them, you will be a very popular guy.|`|lK3TXGBOaa	aaaaaaaaaw i think its so cute... <br>  <br>  - yuo are definately the kind of guy that i want...<br>  - oh and for me there are no limits ( depends on the girl )|`|Kiqv0tHuaa	that's very sweet of you but you also need to be very aware of her feelings...on the first date it would probably be great if u guys hug..if she looks comfortable with it you can move forward but always make sure shes fine with it first.

WTF! and we dont want that reaction.  heres what id do if i were u- assess this girl well, as much as u kan and do something creative keeping her style in mind.  wish ya luck!|`|Oq2EsRyMaa	50, if I recall correctly|`|V8PjfdkIaa	why not be yourself and dont create or pretend anything.|`|AA12300280	Its always different for everyone.

Like going to Cedar Point (an amusement park) or paintballing....if you've ever seen 10 things I hate about you, where they're throwing paint balls at each other....that would be so much fun.  If a guy took me there on the first date, he'd definitely earn extra points.  <br>  <br>  Go with your creativity.|`|B9F4hmjlaa	do it, girls love someone they can talk to or has a personality. so being creative is not bad at all. but dont over do it like your trying to marry her.<br>  just be nonchalant about it|`|kiaijyXVaa	There are no limits!!!

Ergo, big penis, very manly.|`|hnyyPqixaa	Not Really|`|Ii9PHPP0aa	size doesnt really matter...its how you use it that counts ;D|`|FoWxxqTjaa	not if you make up with stamina and over all skills...;)|`|FAQnVhH9aa	it's different for every girl but me personally I like about 7inches max and 5 min. It doesn't really matter but too big is uncomfortable. size is whatever.. you can still be an amazing lover|`|xUCXXb73aa	it don't matter
0884ff2a0f28bad739166da0f1176c3baa	Don't. You might try telling him how you feel about him then if he has any feelings for you he might very well say. If they are not what you want you'll have to move on, dear.|`|uWcYXeeTaa	It kind of sounds like he has told you his true feelings, as unfortunate as they are.  I'm sorry... I've been in this situation, we all have-- you wish he could love you as much as you love him so much that you think he couldn't possibly not love you, and anything else he says is just a lie. it's a tough thing to get over... and it's not so easy.|`|AA10450644	You have to suck it up and just confront him. No use wallowing in misery day in an day out. Better you know now so that you don't waste any more time. If he likes you, then make it happen. If he doesn't, then move on. I hate to sound cliche, but you gotta confront these things head on. Maybe set up a casual conversation at a coffee shop?|`|cOBk3NxQaa	maybe he's telling the truth and because of your feelings you dont want to see it. sorry hon.<br>  just talk to him about it.|`|827993b38a683884568367c98043c28caa	Again with the angst. <br>  <br>  Generally speaking, if a girl is into a guy and she knows the guy knows she is into him, a guy with the slightest interest will make an effort to date the girl if for no other reason than sexual conquest.<br>  <br>  On the contrary, if the guy knows this about the girl, and shows no interest other than platonic friendship - I would bet dollars to donuts (as expensive as donuts are now that might not make a lot of sense) he honestly and truthfully only sees you as a friend.<br>  <br>  Back off the "madly in love" for now and see if things change in the future.
AA10065812	???????<br>  I’ve been a Father’s Rights Advocate for 20 years.   <br>  <br>  First, you need to know that the child support guidelines are not set in stone.  They are just guidelines.  You can make a case for not paying so more.<br>  <br>  First, never pay your child support directly to the mother as it can be considered a gift and not support.  Always pay threw the court.<br>  <br>  Whether he will get an increase, or possibly a decrease, will depend on your state laws.  Get on the state government web site and look up the statutes on child support.  They have a search engine for doing so.  If you just want to do an internet search use key words:<br>  <br>  "child support"+{state name}+statutes<br>  <br>  As for custody, many think the courts are rigged against dads, but in reality, it is more about attorneys unwilling or lacking the knowledge to truly fight for the father's rights.  This is why it is important to learn how to interview and hire the right attorney.  It is also important to do as much as possible on your own and not pay the attorney to do it.<br>  <br>  Part of the problem with getting your rights knowing what to do to prove your case, and how to remind the judge of their responsibilities.  Let me start with the judge.<br>  <br>  Always take people with you to court who are not there to testify.  Make sure they are sitting where the judge can see them, each equipped with a tablet and pen to take notes.  It’s best to use a Court Watch Form designed for this purpose.  I have one in the manual at Dads House.<br>  <br>  If the judge is not doing his job, using the info from this form, you can, appeal, and/or get  the judge sanctioned and removed from the case.  You file a complaint with the State Supreme Court at your state capital.<br>  <br>  Start keeping a daily journal of all your activities.  The most common way to prevent a father from getting his rights through the courts is a false allegation, usually sexual.  Over 60% of divorcing father are accused of child sexual abuse, of which only 4% are found to have any relevance, but there are no penalties for doing so.  A daily journal is your number one piece of evidence in court and you can even refer to it while on the stand.  <br>  <br>  Gather evidence.  Check the site below to see if it is illegal to record conversations without the other person knowing.  If your state does not have a law either way, than it defaults to the federal ruling which says one person in a conversation must know they are being recorded.  You’re that one person.  In Missouri it is specifically legal, in Kansas there is no mention either way.  If you live in two different states, and one has a law against it, than it applies when the call originates from within that state,<br>  <a href="http://www.rcfp.org/taping/" rel="nofollow">http://www.rcfp.org/taping/</a><br>  <br>  Now, you can't just record, you also have to transcribe it into the daily journal.<br>  <br>  If you want to learn how to do all this go to Dads House in Yahoo Groups.  There's an educational manual in the file section that can teach you what you need to know.  Take the time to learn what you can and should do.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/DadsHouse/">http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/Dad...</a><br>  <a href="http://tinyurl.com/GiveKidsAChoice" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/GiveKidsAChoice</a><br>  <a href="http://www.fathersandfamilies.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.fathersandfamilies.org/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.parentalalienation.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.parentalalienation.org/</a>|`|Ikd9cppcaa	Well, if you are the mother of the new baby you need to consider how your husband is reacting to the need for more child support. Teens are expensive to raise and they are his kids, too. Just because the Mom makes more money doesn't lessen his financial obligations to his kids. I think you should consider this same thing can happen to you (if you are the new wife).|`|b7bb85526b028b7f92b16c8204ed4012aa	I leaned a long time ago that it never hurt anybody to want. Now child support is only between the childs biological mom and dad, no matter if they are remarried or single, so if Dad isnt making anymore money than when the support was ordered then nothing will happen. Child support is based on what he makes, not what mom wants or feels she should get. No need to worry here. Good luck|`|6oMpHXSiaa	Yeah , let her take him to court. He has another child you said? Well since he has another obligation to take care of, he can get his child support reduced believe it or not it's true.|`|zu10q3Qyaa	Child support is always based on an income scale.  Nobody can raise it or lower it.  Not even a judge.  It is set by the State.|`|CFjFaKBzaa	The father would just have to go through the motions, provide verification of income and let the court decide to increase the payments or not. If the children were given to the mother during the divorce if the mother is "unfit" to care for the children the father has to provide verification of how she is unfit to get them. Or is he just wanting the kids so he doesn't have to pay support? The father should ask for more visitation days if he wants to be more active in the children's life. But he must consider the children are in their teens, they'd be missing out on social time with friends if for some reason he'd get custody of them. As far as the moms new boyfriend who was found innocent of molesting his daughter, why did you bring that up, he did not do anything wrong?|`|6my2NqzBaa	I am a Payor I am going through a simaler issue,, Except my issue My X lived in Florida and took my Kids across sate lines. to GA. I am officially filling for a Modification. That is what I would recoment doing especilay with the way the ecconomy is the judge might be more leaniant. On what the non parrent will have to pay especialy if the custodial Parrent is makng more and the Non Custodial Parent has just had another child... This is what i purpose..<br>  I Pay $535.00 a month for 2 kids.
eFeRODh3aa	This may sound harsh but don't think I am trying to be mean. I really recommend you read the book "He's just not that into you" by Greg Behrendt. It really teaches women a lot and how easy guys are, if he isn't calling and trying to pursue you, he has probably lost interest. There is really no point to trying to make him like you..You will find a guy who is really into you and will call you when he says he is going to call, never keep you waiting, and will always make sure he sees you, and you will never have to question what he is feeling because you will know.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hes-Just-That-Into-Understanding/dp/068987474X" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Hes-Just-That-Into...</a>|`|BitAsc8daa	Stop being so available to him.  Next time he calls don't answer.  pretend youre busy.  Dont answer his messages straight away.  Make him see that you dont need him and you have a fun life without him.  He thinks he has you wrapped around his finger..  Just continue to talk to him normally but talk about other guys and say you have dates when you don't really etc..  If he thinks he's losing you, he will want you back.. Trust me. <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Ao0WxPkAhAeCLhqN91UMZ8jsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090309201616AAJ5XeP">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a> answer mine?|`|lK3TXGBOaa	guys are jerks like that maybe he thouught you were gonna give in and if you didnt then he just walked away ( hint: he likes easy skanky girls) i say move on and find yourself someone better and make him jealous...|`|DcrI9zmkaa	Uhh, the simple fact is, he's just not that into you.  You can't "make" him like you, nor should you want to.  You need to find someone who loves you for you -- no manipulation or trickery necessary.<br>  <br>  Bottom line?  Accept his friendship or cut your ties.  Either way, you need to move on.|`|856df45cd220b8db7117dd899c6e5ae2aa	Like the movie says "He's just not that into you."  Sorry.  That's what the "I still wanna be friends" means.  Just move on.  There's nothing you can do.|`|s6itMDRTaa	could be that you wren't getting his signels and you didn't and him out <br>  he might have found someone else he likes better then you it happens <br>  someone else like his friend might like you and he backed off|`|0ktcvglRaa	Perhaps he's simply lost interest in you, or he's interested in someone else. It happens all the time.
AA10065812	???????<br>  It is a federal crime under the Violence Against Women Act, as is refusing to not have sex with her.|`|IvMPh09baa	YOUR A RETARD.<br>  <br>  you are a threat to society on your own, no wife needed.  <br>  <br>  I hope you are committed to a looney house asap.|`|b7bb85526b028b7f92b16c8204ed4012aa	If one spouse is unwilling to participate but the other still forces the unwilling spouse to participate in sex then it becomes spousal rape and charges can be filed the forcing spouse can be arrested and charged with this crime. Not always the easiest crime to prove in court though but does happen alot with many more never reported|`|a380da2fafb5a1c092370a06829451f8aa	Yes, it's a crime.  Specifically, rape.|`|zdQGden1aa	If your wife told you that she felt violated then yes, its rape. Don't ask questions that you know the answer too....geeeshhhh|`|xdOgQPEkaa	no means no. that doesnt change just because u r married.<br>  <br>  <br>  jerk|`|ASq7LSggaa	yes u weirdo no is NO why would u force someone to do something they dont wanna do u just wanna have control thats all ur a ******* pig i hope she kicks u so hard in the balls u will never think about making someone do somthing they dont wanna do again|`|iwXhDnC4aa	Yes, it is possible to rape your wife.  It doesn't matter who the woman is, rape is rape.  ***.|`|Bgo0xmjnaa	At least one of my wives always wants sum so i never have to force it.<br>  <br>  <br>  Sort it out dude!

76imFZT4aa	Don't base your decision only because you guys argue.<br>  <br>  <br>  If it helps make a list of pros and cons of why you're in the relationship and why you like/dislike it. <br>  <br>  If you realize you think it's worth it then continue on. If not, then end it. You're still young.:D <br>  <br>  <br>  And it also depends on what the "expectations" are. If it's silly stuff, then learn to let it go. I've always been told to pick my own battles. Somethings just arn't worth fighting over. <br>  <br>  If it's important things, like finding a job, drug/alcohol addictions, responsibilities ect. then you might wanna take it as a red flag that he isn't the kind of person you wanna make a "commitment" with.|`|1glG9a2caa	Their are no"rules" but it looks like your headed for disaster|`|g9AAUkraaa	Not always. And if that friend was a boy that told you that, he wants a piece. Any who, if you are expecting something from him but are too scared to say, sometimes you lose track of what that is and instead you just start being an, well you know, a hole. People do that sometimes. Also, you might be too young for love and confusion can cause frustration in a relationship. First think of why this guy is "the guy" then write it down. The next time you are really pissed off at him, look back at the list and scratch out the ones he isnt at the time. If you lose half the list in a scratching frenzy, scratch him out all together.|`|19iD220Jaa	Sure sounds like it....<br>  Save the games and the extra drama and stress picking fights and just come out and tell him straight up what you looking for or what you expect from him. <br>  If he chooses not to try to understand and come to some kind of compromise then just move on. Its no reason to continue to make both of you unhappy and a living hell.<br>  <br>  Put yourself in his shoes- would you feel like you are getting pushed away and if so how long will you take the fight until you finally had had enough and leave.<br>  Karma is a .....|`|4g1N02Bwaa	You have only been together for 6 months and you are already picking fights. Sounds like you should call it quits. It would be different if you were together for years. You need to accept him for him if you love him and stop having such high expectations. Relationships are about making sacrifices for each other & trust.
IPS3hWweaa	Yes, he's still living at home with his parents! Why isn't he on his own?<br>  <br>  His parents apparently want him gone, because they aren't helping him, but he's still there. Does he work? Theres more going on with him than you've told.|`|kF2TI78kaa	he's sick,he probably doesn't feel like moving,he just needs to rest.<br>  <br>  now the question title "if you're dating a loser"-he's not a loser if you like him,simple as that|`|3b1aedec10a0b523f4b7f7225ba19c12aa	umm.. first question. <br>  your 22 year old bf doesn't have a car/license? and still lives with his parents? does he go to college or have a job? <br>  his parents probably won't help him recover much because they are tired of carrying his *** through everything. and wants him to grow up. i can't say too much becasue i dont know him or the whole story but from what i know/assume he sounds like a loser.|`|r86HhwhBaa	Maybe it would be better if you went to his place to look after him. I bet if he is sick he won't appreciate having to get up so early to go to your place every day. If he is sick he should be at home resting.|`|rM7Qh360aa	22 is still perfectly normal to be living with parents. <br>  maybe he doesnt want to get you sick?<br>  when your sick you really just want to be at home
xDdhUldraa	Get off the computer and talk face to face with the person you want to deal with.  Communication and trust are the keys to a good relationship. If you don't have both then you have nothing.  By the way, email, texting, facebooking and all the other electronic things, while they get a message out, are still not communication.  People can not see your emotions and facial features and body language while you are typing.  Good luck.|`|fOHn1ISdaa	Flash your boobies|`|G6krcCSCaa	maybe u to should talk it out or something
83df363c0b39116bc273bca1cf432436aa	As a husband for 22yrs, I never told my wife that I wish I could sleep<br>  with another woman, or anything of that type, however being a human<br>  and having a brain, sometimes when I was younger I thought of having<br>  sex with a woman that may have approached me, but the longer you<br>  stay married and if you are a true loving husband, then those thoughts<br>  go away, and now I can say I no longer think that, yes I still glance<br>  if I see a pretty  woman, but that is only it, just a glance, but it is not<br>  all the time, and when I am with my wife, I make sure she is respected<br>  at all times by me because she deserves nothing better than that.<br>  So now since I am always with my wife I do not have time for anything<br>  else except for her and since I truly love her all my attentions are for<br>  her, and she does the same for me, so that has resulted in us both<br>  being happy in our 22yrs being with each other.|`|0a6f37ff97b71253871297bc4face75aaa	He's telling you fibs. I have had other women show an interest in me and I've said no. All guys do not do these things.

Just one drunken night at the bar, and bada bing bada boom... he will have cheated!<br>  <br>  honestly.... move on, this man is not ready for marriage, if he's that honest to tell you he still wants to have sex with another girl then guess what... HE''S NOT THAT INTO YOU!!!|`|WKtakdsOaa	I think the vast majority of men and women fantasise about others and its totally normal.

Don't you ever think about another man?  Our minds are our own.  I also believe that alot of females as well as males would sleep with someone new if their partner was okay with it.  Marriage seems to be fading out.|`|SvJx5t9Caa	It's only natural. I wouldn't take it personally, but maybe you making such a big deal about things isn't helping. If you acted like it wouldn't bother you it would drive him crazy.|`|sGoEj6qsaa	It's the variety|`|xUCXXb73aa	yes|`|B1lNqtA3aa	I don't really agree with Julie H, more so with Joe J. Humans really are sexual creatures, and it's only natural to "mate" with others. He's not trying to hurt you in any way, and I'm sure he really loves you. It's just basically a naturally instinct to be with other people.<br>  <br>  No offense, but it's the main reason why I won't get married. I mean, what's the point if everyone's always cheating on each other, and half of marriages end up in divorce? I'd rather have fun with whoever I want and be happy. If I fall in love, then great, but I don't need to put a label on things. The whole "marriage" label just ruins things.<br>  <br>  If you're in a committed, monogamous relationship, and you have a problem with him being with another girl, then simply tell him not to do it. And if he goes for it anyway, then you shouldn't be married to him. Live your life, be happy, it's too short to be worrying about things like this. Good luck!|`|7YQQK1e7aa	okay hunny ur man is cheating on u for one and he is trying to come up with things that will convince u other wise and he know u and he's gonna try to use that to his advantage i mean think about it girl u have to b careful with men like that he's just tryin to Waring u just in case u do find out u wont be so surprised|`|VEDKrnqvaa	yes in my opinion men do look at other women and have the desire of having sexuall relations now myself if i was married i wouldnt sleep with any other  women you can see all u want as long as u dont touch unless you have a relationship that you are allowed to sleep with other women and if my wife were to sleep with another man she wouldnt b my wife|`|U4cYbkNQaa	Of course they fantasize. They are men! That doesn't give them the right to cheat, but if you think he is thinking only of you....then you are in for a rude awakening.

That's why Polygamy is legal in this part of the world.<br>  <br>  Men desire sex/women.

He can't just sleep with her and leave. He must take responsibility for her as a husband and as a father if she falls pregnant, if he wants to share her bed.<br>  <br>  Every man thinks about another woman and will cheat. Those that don't cheat are only worried that if they do they will lose their wife, but they still think and long for it.<br>  <br>  Men who have 1 night stands are those who cause a great burden on women, because they wined up pregnancy without any support--thus leaving them to government aid.  That's why he has to marry her first so that she can get her rights.<br>  <br>  Your husband is happy with you and loves you no less but, will be happier if he had another one like you too.<br>  <br>  Their are a lot of polygamous marriages in the west.

Cheating isn't about sex, it's because that person is selfish. He or she doesn't care who they hurt. And they will hurt many more than just their spouse. Their parents, spouses parents, siblings, kids, neighbors, friends, coworkers, grandparents, etc. It's just because they want it and go for it without regard to the consequences. It's all about being selfish.|`|0d23f051f113abf680e24047faa07d4faa	most men have a scavenger gene. this is not unlike a nagging gene.<br>  <br>  let me hasten most men will never touch another woman, however, we will look and admire but never touch.<br>  <br>  its important that you let your husband know you are not agreeable to him 'touching any another woman'.<br>  <br>  simple as it may seem, most men do pay attention to what their wives say.<br>  <br>  sorry to hear your husband  expresses himself in a way that upsets your peace of mind. there is a way a man can communicate with his wife that will not cause her stress and concern.

ise05jjUaa	As long as I've been on YA I've realized that a majority of men including myself love women who aren't to skinny, skinny to the point of where you can see her ribs.  Definitely not a turn on & not definitely not a girl who's overweight.  We love women who are in between, a lady who we can hold onto who has some meat on her bones & curves in all the right places.  She definitely has to have curves, otherwise I might as well be with another man.  So with all that said, I guess its close to an hourglass figure!|`|J14tPA9Eaa	hourglass|`|0fcwsv7Vaa	Apple???|`|zW8tc64qaa	Hourglass! Sorry about the enthusiasm, but seeing a woman with a nice shapely body is one amazing sight. Just sayin'.|`|uRbeSOMwaa	hourglass|`|WcNsMmDZaa	big breasts, big butt, small waist. not necessarily any shape though<br>  women are shaped so many ways|`|ddQ7bmhNaa	Watermelon.|`|VgX29LGdaa	Hourglass all the way. What is apple? Nevermind...I dont want to know. LoL|`|ulUBv22eaa	hourglass
QJOMStw6aa	Yes it is true most girls love to be kissed. But when you think kissing don't just think of kissing them on th lips. I love when my bf kisses my forehead it shows that he is sensitive and it shows me he thinks of me in more than a sexual way. If you really like the girl kiss her on her forehead or the top of her shoulders or if your tall enough on top of her head or her nose. Being kissed somewhere other than the lips shows that he likes you in a different way than just sexually. It makes you feel more wanted i guess. Don't get me wrong being kissed on the lips is great too especially if he's a great kisser. As for the being held part when i first started dating my bf i didn't like to be touched or held but now i feel safest when he is hugging me or just has his arms around me. Its really just a matter of her preference as to whether she wants to be touched. Start slow with a friendly hug and if she seems to want more then go for longer hugs|`|FoWxxqTjaa	kissing + touching + embracing = the bestttt<br>  <br>  big turn on.<br>  kiss her neck, pull her close to you against your body with your hand on the small of her back and the other behind her neck is a good move. just let your bodies become pretzels. lol|`|EkRoSHzDaa	of course they like kissing, whats not to like?<br>  and yes a girl can get turned on jusy by kissing but touching and ebracing is always a good idea to heat things up.<br>  good luck =D|`|eeaXYyCNaa	Yes, Yes, and again Yes.  I think most women love affection.  Being touched and embraced are great ways of being shown affection.  Kissing is a huge turn on.|`|LHhds2tQaa	Well guys like it. I wouldnt see why girls wouldn't enjoy it too. I like kissing. I think I suck. But I like it lol|`|f0ad89cfa72e1f0b8cdbc6a81927e589aa	Yes the girls loves to kiss, but more than anything what can make a woman turned on, it is the words you told her it is like a romance makes anywoman go crazy.|`|c55O7jqXaa	I would say most of them like gentle sweet kisses on their neck, hand, arms, cheek, forehead, lips, etc. You get the point. They also like the guy to have fresh breath|`|3585617e66b6e408b3a748ee15238f75aa	Well, you hit all the things girls like. Getter done. Doit tuit.|`|OKPM1mPhaa	Are you a robot? of course they like that wouldn't you?
Bd16ixUQaa	If you are genuinely concerned about your friend, you should tell her your experience with this guy and what you've seen and heard him do now. <br>  It's natural to be worried that she'll think you want him back, but just assure her you don't and <br>  DON'T PRESSURE HER TO BREAK UP WITH HIM!<br>  ALSO, DON'T SAY ANYTHING THAT IS OPINION OR CONJECTURE!<br>  If you just state the black and white facts- what he has ACTUALLY said and done- and then tell her that she should decide for herself but to be careful, she will believe you are sincere and not trying to get him back.<br>  Now, if she asks your opinion then tell her what your suspicions are and back them up by solid evidence.<br>  <br>  But you should definitely say something.<br>  If you say nqa she's going to think you just want him back.<br>  <br>  If she does end up in the same spot you're in and you didn't say anything, you'll feel guilty and regret it, so you at least have to try.<br>  <br>  And as to you, don't worry, there are better guys and better relationships out there for you. You just have to take things slow and REALLY GET TO KNOW A PERSON BEFORE YOU DATE THEM. I'm 23 and even now I still only date people I've been friends with for a while. Because of this I've had great relationships because I knew the kind of people I was getting involved with. If you're friends with a guy, you'll know if he is into shady stuff when it comes to girls, so you won't have to learn the hard way by actually going out with him blind.<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK!!!
3xfbVk8Vaa	Yes she likes you, but not more than her boyfriend.  She likes you as a backup boyfriend.|`|u7Y1SAViaa	Well I was gonna say before I read the boyfriend part that she is totally into you. Then that screwed everything up and she probably likes you but is pretty faithful with her boyfriend because she hasn't kissed, touched or slept with you.|`|yQDxgLBPaa	She totally likes you! Where is her boyfriend does he go to school where you and her go? Does she talk about him when she is around you? If she don't then it's definite just make shure not to have a drunkin night with her because it will be aawkward and you don't want to maker her uunfaithful|`|47545b799997b68a97de3a33bf88c146aa	I think she likes you<br>  <br>  but after i read that part about her having a boyfriend,<br>  <br>  maybe not?|`|71fc8cbea5928669e06e7c42a2dd8046aa	You my friend are what is known as an emotional tampon. No offense!<br>  <br>  You are deep in the friend zone. She talks to you about all the things she can;t talk to her BF about becasue he doesn;t want to hear it. She is in my opinion playin ya. She probably likes you but she shouldn;t be playing the head games with you, like putting the sign above your bed and crap.<br>  <br>  You are her male girlfriend, that she tells everying to.<br>  <br>  Sorry to be the one to tell ya bro but thats how it looks to me.|`|Jjjg7jcraa	Before: I was going to say DUH she likes you...<br>  After: I still say she likes you, but she's not being very fair to you...it's almost like she has you on the back burner...so when her relationship fails, you'll be there for her to date. Yeah, that works out well for you in the end because you like her...but what's gonna happen when you two are together and she meets someone else? Probably the same thing. Would you be ok with your girlfriend doing with some other guy what she's doing with you?
RkfJ36q2aa	She probably is treating you much like she treats her girl friends. <br>  Or she just thinks of you as a really, close friend who she can go to for anything. <br>  <br>  I don't think she likes you the way you think, but I may be wrong. <br>  <br>  I mean, you are a Sophmore, and I'm just a lowly freshman. In high school.|`|PeI5rpK1aa	Not really. Saying your bed is "her territorry" could possibly be a sign. But she only sits very close to you when she's drunk. Most girls lie on their friends beds.If she liked you as more than a friend it's more likely she wouldn't come to you for someone to talk to. Because we usually discuss guys we like in them sort of conversations. And the fact that she comes up to see you all the time means your a very close friend. It doesn't mean she doesn't like you though. Some girls are to shy to throw any hints around. So there is a chance she may like you. (though it's unlikely) Just throw some hints around yourself. And if she doesn't like there's a chance she may fall for you in time.  <br>   <edit in after> That doesn't change my opinion much since she wasn't hinting at it before. Stay her friend and if she ends up breaking up with him, be there to comfort her and she may begin to like you (but don't be a rebound because she may regret it and that would leave no chance of a relationship opening up and may even close the friendship)
S3yrCIRcaa	I dont see why people would make fun of u... Pale skin is not a bad thing ( i actually find it hott)|`|vzBrloF2aa	Personally i have very very pale skin as well and i find nothing wrong with it i would prefer it actually.

Do not let these people get you down, everyone is different. There is nothing wrong with being really white.|`|F0sJR0jbaa	Eh.  Guys like girls who can get a tan.  Not girls who fry beat red and then go back to pale again.  But its not like i couldnt see myself with a pale girl.  As long as your overall attractive.|`|OaSkUoZBaa	I only like guys who are Pale White and Ice Cold........ and Sparkle!|`|8hkY00b7aa	THAT IS FINE|`|Bfwg0eBJaa	yes, very much so.|`|rWwHjUsKaa	only if she has jet black hair and dark eyes|`|WrvnpJMbaa	Go to a tanning booth just be careful. <br>  no body likes people with porcelian skin. you want to be at least a little tan.

d4xvwTG5aa	No matter where you come from, at the bottom of things - we are all human beings. Yes, there might be some cultural differences but does that really matter?? (everyone adapts anyways) your mom would like you to keep Serbians in the family, that's the bottom line. Like you said, you already had a Serbian BF that wasn't nice to you, you could try dating another one but, why? you live in Australia, why not australian guys? where you come from doesn't matter but I would say date australian guys, plus they are nice! Good luck!|`|ljwi8J0aaa	well it should not matter where they are from if yo like them you should date the no matter what culture they are from go by how you feel

If it was while you were dating, then you might as well give up dude. You screwed up and you should move on. But if you were on your break then you should just be there for her and accept that girls have their good and bad moments.|`|M1B1EvI7aa	shes probably playing hard to get but cant always keep it up<br>  when she does say i hate u.... dw just play along and say hmm not like me than caus i love you if she says u kissed another girl tell her it was a mistake and i realized who i really want|`|oPRvq655aa	First off, you shouldn't be kissing another girl when you are dating another. <br>  <br>  She might be confused with her feelings for you right now, and just can't decide on one. <br>  But I don't think you should still be with this girl ..|`|LgOpzl5aaa	that is sad i feel so bad 4 u but i think maybe she is just having mood swing dont tell her that but try buying her somthing girls love gifts or try talking to her about your relationship it might help.<br>  <br>                            hope this helps the best of luck to you|`|13XBknitaa	you are retarded<br>  <br>  cheating is bad<br>  <br>  answer my question please!<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090309205315AAFRKnH">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|sE17TXzxaa	dump her for the other girl.
wiItXJTgaa	Well, I'm not really sure if i should be the one to answer your question, but regarding the third one, girls like to hang out too! Dates are fun and all, eating dinner and talking with your favorite guy, but we also like to cuddle up on the couch. I'm not sure if that's what she means, but you can try inviting her over for a movie, or if you aren't comfortable w/ that, then go out to a movie. Of course hang out could also mean going to the park, be it an amusement park or just a normal nature park. I don't know what she likes doing, but for example, if she likes animals, maybe try having her volunteer with you at a animal shelter? I hope this helps! good luck! :)

I think it makes a good topic to bring up and to laugh about also.

Like having a conversation?|`|d7ihBw4Qaa	Be friends with him, you both seem to like each other and you say you can't ask him out so why not do the next best thing..ya know?

Just talk to him one day and start a conversation and who knows, you both may have a ton in common. Good luck.|`|0krK45Reaa	okay, no offense but i think this may just be you being stressed out. relax, enjoy life, take time to breath. =) of course he knows you exist, and the fact that you guys are in the same places at the same time is just a coincidence. don't look for him, but it's okay to talk to him in lunch line or by his locker. just i advise no stalking...otherwise you're good. =)|`|Jjjg7jcraa	Well, it seems to me that you still like him haha. Yeah, he likes you. I had that same thing happen to me, but I was in 8th grade. I finally gave up on the guy because he was always too shy to say anything to me...and as soon as I got over him, and didn't care anymore, he called me and asked me out. That's been years now, but we're still friends, and still joke about it every once in while!|`|w7HWpFxjaa	if you catch him staring i at you again then go up to him and talk to him, not about him staring at you but just to talk. and if he completely shuns you than he doesn't like you if he stays and talks it a possibility that he likes you or he just wants to be friends.|`|69Jcu8Ufaa	Haha.  Eighth grade.  Wow, I wish I was that young again.  If you're not allowed to ask anyone out (which I think is good, kids shouldn't be dating when they still haven't left puberty) then there's only one thing to do...be friends with him.  So just do what "old people" like me do, have a conversation with him.  Talk about whatever comes to your mind.|`|J7EWQHYJaa	I don't know.. does he?<br>  Make sure he sees you one day and he'll know that you exist ;D<br>  Okay time to get serious just go talk to him the way you have before.. and let everything fall into place from there :)|`|4AOadRTcaa	I THINK HE LIKES YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! just like keep doing that and keep talking to him say hi in the hallway while walking to next class and do all the little things|`|cTr5g9roaa	how about trying to start a conversation. like maybe a simple hii next time you see him.|`|BitAsc8daa	Go and ask him about his classes or what hes doing on the weekend.  THen u can say hello whenever u see him at school.|`|djs36Cl9aa	Just go up to him and say, 'remember those fun times we had in science class.' That will break the ice.
hJDbOKR6aa	Really, why bother? He clearly doesn't know what he wants right now since he goes back to his ex, hooks up with you when he's drunk, ignores you when he's sober. He even told you that he's not looking for a relationship. Maybe you should just give him some time. Anyways your already his first pick, don't worry.<br>  <br>  In the meantime, TRY to meet other guys, even if you know your not over him.|`|aXOyK3uBaa	Your question will be answered when you accept the fact that MEN ARE NOT REQUIRED TO WANT TO BE IN A RELATIONSHIP WITH YOU.<br>  <br>  Girls like to PRETEND that its "bad" when we don't a relationship,<br>  But its NOT bad... we're just not interested in that stuff.<br>  <br>  Typical Girl: "Hey you want to be my boyfriend??<br>  I'll let you NOT bang other chicks and pay for everything!!!"<br>  <br>  Uh, no thanks.<br>  <br>  We would rather be single.<br>  Relationships are for girls.<br>  <br>  Typical Girl2: "Why can't I get a boyfriend, I have alot to offer"<br>  <br>  Uh, yeah but part of your offer is we gotta buy you stuff.<br>  Where's in the incentive in that???<br>  <br>  ---------<br>  "IDK if hes testing to see if i can be a faithful girl which i can be"<br>  -------<br>  <br>  No he's not testing you. <br>  He OBVIOUSLY doesn't care about faithful.<br>  <br>  Why aren't you GLAD that he doesn't want a relationship? This way he can bang whoever he wants and you can't call him a jerk, a__hole, liar or cheater.<br>  <br>  Isn't that awesome????|`|eACZ1Rhjaa	He is married, not because of the child but because he wanted to be married. He isn't over her and may still end up back with his family. <br>  You are a boody call not a relationship. How many years do you want to be available for drunken sex? Make sure you use birth control and he does too. Having a baby when you aren't in a relationship will be very hard and might stop you from getting a relationship later. Fighting this dude for child support will put your child after his legitimate child. If he doesn't want a relationship with you he might not with your child either.

And if it really bothers you, then I believe you should let go, because even though he may be cute, watching him look at other pretty, or 'prettier' girls, hurts alot.It's really devestating, especially if you care for him alot. So if you're really unhappy, then you should let go of whats making you this way, because I swear that you'll find someone way better and boyfriend material. And you'll even feel released and happy.|`|bWpYLSKSaa	It doesn't sound as if you two have anything going on between you. If he really liked you, then he would be able to stay with you and not lust after other women. I think that you should break up with him, unless he starts showing that he cares about you. Talk to him also, because he may not be aware of his behavior.|`|EkRoSHzDaa	if you've tried talking with him and hes still a pig, then its really not worth it. if hes really that "girl crazy" then its only a matter of time before he cheats. so the way i see it is, stop yourself from getting hurt when your really attached to him, let him go. you can do WAYYY better hun.|`|pZA16dloaa	There is NO reason, for you to subject yourself to a boyfriend that seems to be more interested in everybody except for the person he should be. <br>  <br>  Talk to him about it, and if he'd rather look at every other girl around than at you, then he could do that without you there.<br>  <br>  I hope that helped your though process.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Could you please help me out too?

It's a risk you can take if you want to, and to me personally, I don't think making mistakes or getting hurt is a bad thing at all.<br>  I believe that even if you do end up in pain or regretting anything, at least you learned something.

uGPQLyzSaa	Don't stop looking for "the one" because he's out there. It sounds like you're young, and still discovering what truly gives you butterflies and makes you truly happy. Sometimes the more we look however, the harder it is to find. It's like catching a butterfly- the more you try, the further away it flies; but when you settle down, it'll come to you.<br>  <br>  It sounds like you're using Zach the same way Peter used you.

You are very attractive. I suggest that you just date and not get involved in serious relationships. You are too young for that. The whole idea of dating is to find out about people and having a good time. Along with that comes knowledge of how to read people. The better you are at reading people, the better off you will be in the long run, not only in dating but in business as well. BTW, "dating" does NOT include sex with the guy. You will find out how to tell whether a guy is honest with you or not, and how he will make you feel.<br>  <br>  Regards,<br>  Dan|`|N7gOE1btaa	Never settle.  You are only letting yourself settle because you have been hurt before.  There are good guys out there who will give you those emotions you so desired--the blushing, heart pumping, weak knees kind of stuff.  Also, if you look at it another way, you wont love this adequate guy and you probably wont be able to maintain a long term relationship with him because of it, so really you are doing him a disservice.

I would say go ahead and do it, (don't compromise your integrity though).

It may be that you're mistaking the new exciting feelings you have for him as being horny, but as far as stopping it goes, hopefully it won't get less in time, but you'll find that it is a lot more bearable.<br>  <br>  Are the two of you sexually active, and have you been sexually active before?  If you are a teenager it may just be hormones.  There are several things to consider, but I think I understand how you feel.

N7gOE1btaa	Often times women associate the value of a man by their job.  This is because it reflects the drive, education, and stability.  Having a low-level job means you could essentially lose your job at any time.  Also, having a low-level job suggests that you aren't concerned with being a dominant player--as such you will be a weak husband and father.  <br>  Yes, I know its not the case but psychologically this is true of many women.  Take it from me, I have a degree in psychology.|`|wHgBnMipaa	A lot of old-fashioned women think that men should be the bread-winner and have a great job, but most women nowadays should be okay with you having a simple career.

And i would totally be creeped out and a little angry at that guy. what a jerk.<br>  but yeah, honestly, me too. everyone says the first one hurts like crap...I'm waiting till marriage.|`|WYHC69xOaa	KILL IT WITH FIRE|`|EXArkmVWaa	just chill out and do it
0LXVSFEGaa	idklol|`|C8Djjxqkaa	She thinks, if you cared you would know what is wrong. She expects you to read her mind.|`|gRwYBmKQaa	On a more serious point of advice,I have been"moody for many years,not really knowing what sets it off,but knowing that I don't like how it makes me feel or how I makes other people feel because of my crankiness.It is a "mood disorder" a chemical in the brain that's just a wee bit unbalanced.Now I'm not one to go to the doc. and get some power drugs,so I left it, and tried dealing with it ,mind over matter.Which was very hard.It was until another lady I work with, said she has the same problem,and she said that she takes,vitamin B6 supplement,you can get it at any grocery store or pharmacy.Tell your girlfriend to take one vitamin a day.It will take about 3-4 weeks for the moods to balance out,but it worked for me,just tell her to be patient with it.Also google,"B6 for moods" you will get more info. on it,and there is nothing harmfull about it,because it's just a vitamin.Good luck:)|`|ajzdsUldaa	This is a very complicated question, especially as you don't really specify anything or give very much information.<br>  <br>  Is she moody for no reason? How old is she? Does she seem to get upset or angry over small things? If she is a teenager and the answer is "yes" to those questions, then I'm afraid you'll have to deal with. This is normal teenage angst, and girls hormones can cause them to be very tempermental. <br>  <br>  Are you sure you're not doing anything to upset her? Ask her why she is acting upset when she is being moody - there is normally a reason for a woman to become moody, and it's normally something you've done. Men can be very insensitive sometimes through no fault of their own. It could even be something that's going on at home with her family that is causing her to become emotional.<br>  <br>  If she is very unreasonable though, I can understand you being irritated by her behaviour. It all depends on whether or not you love her, or are just in it for fun. If you love her, talk to her about her behaviour, and tell her that it bothers you and you're sick of dealing with it.<br>  <br>  If you don't really love her and it's just a bit of fun, dump her and find a girl who's a little less hormonal.|`|0884ff2a0f28bad739166da0f1176c3baa	xheffalu has got it right.

I suggest you show her what she could be missing if she doesn't change don't be afraid to make her a tad bit jealous of other girls you hang out with show and then show her how you really care, i mean you must right? you are at least TRYING to solve the problem by coming on here.

2eztcCO0aa	You made a big mistake when you allowed his crying to change your mind about breaking up with him.  Can you imagine what your life is going to be like if spend it putting up with disrespect, cheating, etc. just to keep other people from feeling bad?  You're going to be pretty miserable.<br>  <br>  Get a backbone.  Break up with him and let him cry if he wants.  Stop waiting for other people to give you what you need; you have a right to demand what you want, to demand better.|`|f1f028e1b87f4263abe46dd6cf2aa259aa	"he flirts with other girls while i'm right there and will have them stay the night at his house"<br>  <br>  he has girls spend the night and you still consider him your boyfriend???|`|zW8tc64qaa	Here's some practical advice:<br>  <br>  If he seems like he will turn out to be unfaithful, he isn't the right guy for you. Not to mention that he is a liar. Plain and simple as that. He deliberately does things that he knows will strike a nerve, sounds pretty inconsiderate to me, don't cha think? You're young, do you really want to waste your time when you have an abundance of opportunity? You should just break up with him and make it final, that is unless you think there is hope for him. At this rate, it doesn't seem like it. <br>  <br>  Good luck with whatever you choose to do.|`|9fMzwsokaa	Most man only do what you let them dont let him have his cake and eat it too and that crying he did was fake beleive me I know and if he was in to u he will have more repect not to flert with other women in your face so I beleive no women should B with a man that doesn't have any respect for them if you dont like him any more let him know keep it real thats what I will do cause aint no other way but to keep it real after what hes putin you through you owe it to yourself to b happy so go for it GOOD LUCK MEN IS LIKE A BOX OF CHOCOLATES YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT YOUR GONNA GETT! AND THE BEST WAY TOO GET OVER A MAN IS TO GET UNDER A NOTHER ONE|`|FxXmJrdtaa	Im sure at this point every guy looks like they'd make a good bf huh?  You need to leave him.  You only live this life once, and you live it for you.  Do whatever makes you happy.  Trust me. I had an ex who threatened suicide everytime I tried to leave him, so of course, I stuck around.  I was SO unhappy.  Then one day I couldnt take it anymore, and left. And guess what?  He's still alive.  So leave him, he'll survive, his tears will dry, and you'll be happy.|`|p0Ry2TJAaa	I know that it is really hard to let go of someone you love, even temporarily.  But, the fact that he flirts with other girls and that he has them stay the night at his house is absolutely uncalled for. You deserve so much more respect than that. If I were you, I would not put up with that. I know its hard, but you are going to have to atleast take a break from this fellow and just give yourself a rest from all the worries. At first, you will wonder if you made the right decision- but once you start dating you will feel so much better and be happy with your decision.  Just don't look back and keep one foot infront of the other.  Maybe this break will knock some sense into this guy and let him know what he is missing out on.<br>  <br>  'set it free, if it comes back it is meant to be'<br>  <br>  goodluck!
yDRv3dUpaa	just dont leave the one you love for the one you like. you will end up regreting it.|`|e8MLcCMAaa	Well, if you are considering cheating on your current boyfriend, that is not the right idea. Imagine being in his shoes... how would you feel if he was with some other girl at his college right now? I would think about this situation and reconsider the relationship. Can you really love someone when you have feelings for someone else?  That doesn't sound like a committed relationship to me. I would say if you really like this new guy and you think that you would be happier with him, then break it off with your boyfriend. But, if like you say you truly are in love with your boyfriend, then I would let the guy you are starting to like know that you just can't do this anymore because you are committed to someone else. Hope this helps! =)
CDzStUPUaa	If 3 tests came back negative, you probably aren't.  Sometimes anxiety over a possible pregnancy can delay it.  Either take another test if you're still uncomfortable with the results or see a gyn.  I hope you learned to protect yourself hereafter; or abstain.<br>   <br>   Seriously, your playing with fire and could alter your life forever by becoming a mommy before you're ready to be one.
x923qeOcaa	My girlfriend is shorter than me, and that's how I like it. :)  It all depends on the guy and his height as well in most cases.  Some don't like their girlfriend to be too short, or too tall compared to them although I've seen happy couples with guys as tall as 6' 5" with girlfriends your height or shorter.  It all just takes time to find the right person.  Confidence especially helps with the choosing, if you feel you are too short, it may transfer on to the beliefs of guys as well. But the right guy will come along and will love you for you, not your looks or height.|`|bWgF0NoTaa	sweetie, i'm 23 and i'm 4'11"..  almost every guy i have met has told me that they prefer short girls over tall girls..  they like how i have to look up at them and it's fun when they flirt with you b/c they say stupid things to make you laugh, like "aww i didn't see you down there"..<br>  <br>  don't stress yourself out about it..  short girls have an advantage..  we can date short guys or tall guys.. <br>  <br>  my best friend is 5'9" and she only dates guys 6'1" and over b/c if she wears heels, she doesn't want to "tower" over them..<br>  <br>  imagine if a guy was 5'5" and he was dating a girl who was 6'?..  short girls definitely have it better..|`|gRsuXxkbaa	shorter is my choice but I have dated women taller than myself - I like a female thats 5 ft and a lil under tho - so cute !!!!|`|weqUqkZUaa	Yeah a short girl is fine :) - i'm only 5'5 so that works perfect for me haha.|`|0ktcvglRaa	Guys LOVE short girls! I'm 5'2" and my boyfriend is 6'6". When all else fails, wear heels or platforms!|`|oYxcIeiGaa	i think it really depends on the height of the other guy<br>  it would be awkward for someone like 6'7" to date someone like 4'10". Thats too much of a gap for most guys know. Most guys prefer that the girl is shorter than them though so thats a good thing you are short! But guys mostly base it on facial appearances. If she's hot, why not? (i know it sounds really biased but thats how the guys at my school are!) Theres this really short girl I think around your height and she has sorta weird proportions (short height, short legs, long arms) but she is seriously pretty so she's dating this guy who's like 5'8", so I think it's mostly looks more than height.|`|EWa7fzsCaa	Im 6'4" and finding a guy taller than me is kinda hard lol, but my first boyfriend was about a foot shorter than me. But height doesnt really bother me that much.|`|fFhAeOEAaa	Guys prefer shorter girls.. statistically anyway.|`|vrIQNPZhaa	yes i dont know what 4'10''  are in meters but i do like small short girls, i really dont like girls taller then me, im not saying i wouldnt go out with one im just saying its not my thing.|`|fsF2SSVHaa	i only like short dark haired women|`|qZkz6U1Faa	I'm 6'4" 1/2, so no it would look weird|`|PZIqJyctaa	the truth is is that it doesn't matter how tall u are if you are cute that is!!!!!|`|Bgo0xmjnaa	Hehe you're so tiny<br>  <br>  Marry me?<br>  xxx|`|v5DXPUjMaa	I can't speak for the other guys, but as for myself, I do take hight into account in assessing a woman, but that's not the only thing. I've seen some very attractive women that are about 6' and also attractive women that are around your hight. Usually I find tall women attractive, but that doesn't mean I'd say no to a gal just because she's short.|`|e8MLcCMAaa	I am also pretty short, shorter than many other girls at my school. I am 5 foot 2 and all of my boyfriends have been taller than me. My current boyfriend is 5 foot 9 and he doesn't seem to mind my height at all! As long as he doesn't tower over you, you shouldn't have any problems with your height situation. But also, you wouldn't want to be with the type of guy who looks down on you because of your height. In general though, guys tend to like shorter girls. I wouldn't sweat it. And look at it this way, we aren't short. We're just fun size! Hope this helps=)|`|YIPIIXHlaa	Since there are only 5 boys in your class, I think that's your problem. Once you get into a new crowd of people that you haven't known since before you had breasts, you'll be noticed in a romantic way.<br>  <br>  Be thankful you're not 6'1, I'm sure it's a little more frustrating to be a head taller than the boys than under them. Plus, I've noticed that tall men (the men I have crushes on...) go for shorter women, around the 5 feet range.|`|v4rjKAJ1aa	For the most part, guys like girls to be shorter than them.

Its just simple curiosity|`|IvMPh09baa	uh.... was he looking her up to be in contact again? or just looking her up for the fun of it?|`|c55O7jqXaa	Well I certaintly don't think it is appropriate. It doesn't matter whether you are hormonal, the jealous type, or he is truth worthy it is wrong from him to do this. He must be curious for some reason. is this his first baby? He may be feeling the pressures of becoming a Father for the first time. Some guys tend to start doing things they normally wouldn't do because od fears and worries. i know this is not an excuse, ut just trying to see both sides of it. <br>  <br>  He needs to stop all contact with ex's. This is not ok. I know it wouldn't be with me.|`|zdQGden1aa	Would he take her back in a heartbeat? See, don't ask questions that you already know the answer to.<br>  If the answer to my question is NO, then why be mad. If the answer is YES, then you've got some sorting to do.|`|o6xLWwZvaa	No not unless you are jealous and can't trust your husband. Who cares if she would take him back in a heartbeat. You should worry if your husband would go back to her in a heartbeak.|`|OtKCAeQZaa	Yes but is he will to take her back in an instant|`|7iYzBzN7aa	Yes and No. He should be more concerned with you. But with all these crazy ways to get in contact with old friends and ex's, the temptation is sometimes too great, especially if there was a lack of closure in the past relationship. If it leads to more than just message exchanges, like "remember when we did..." then it needs to be addressed. If it seems harmless, I wouldn't be pissed. If it seems that it would lead to something more, like erotic chat or face-to-face meetings, then call the National Guard.|`|rauhZc8Laa	Mad no, hurt maybe.  Jealous or not the jealous type - that is disrespectful.  I am not the jealous type but if my husband did that behind my back I would wonder what his intentions are. And they may be innocent but how are you suppose to know. He shouldn't make you have any doubts. Have you talked to him about it? Congrats on the baby.|`|1hDhmql4aa	If he was just curious to see where she is at in life then I wouldn't panic,mention it if you need to but be nice about it!  I would have to be one of the most committed partners I know and I looked up an X just out of curiosity.  Tell him that if he wants to look up x's that it would be better to let you know so you don't loose trust in him!<br>  If they are messaging each other then that is different.  It is unnecessary for him to be in contact with her.  What ever it is TALK to him when you are feeling your best and not emotional!|`|HE56Jra6aa	Why is he looking her up to begin with... I'd put a stop to it. you said it yourself... Don't open that Psychos can of warms... you maybe the one to get hurt. Delete it.|`|wUWvO5r6aa	Yes you should be mad I would but I know my husband and I know I have no worries I just get a really nice purse for that big mistake and I am over it LOL|`|t0rOQ5FWaa	Yes you have that right
0ktcvglRaa	Why don't you want to meet her, other than the fact that she doesn't like you because she hasn't met you yet?|`|Ikd9cppcaa	Go meet his Mom. I'm sure she feels left out since he has brought you to meet his Dad. Bring her some flowers and repeat nice things her son has said about her. Say you feel like you know her because Tony always says what a good cook she is (or whatever). Smile and be nice even if she is rude.|`|g4AAZRuxaa	No it is not wrong.|`|jV99kgWbaa	You can only be your lovable self ;)<br>  <br>  So bite the bullet and meet his mom. Walk right up to her, look her straight in the eye and say, "Hi, I'm pleased to meet you at last."<br>  <br>  If she doesn't like you, that's not your fault; it's her problem.  But I think she will melt once she gets to know you.|`|o6xLWwZvaa	I think it's unfair that you met the father but dont want to meet the mother. Who cares if she doesnt like you. She probably thinks this way because she is jealous that you already met the father and not her. So meet her, get to know her, let her get to know you.|`|vwoqIUR6aa	just meet her. who knows-maybe she will like you once you meet her. maybe you won't like her.|`|AOtnoozdaa	Sounds like his mom has a preconcieved notion of you.  What I'd suggest doing is meet her, and prove to her that your a good person; worthy of dating her son.  Be nice, no matter if she's nice to you or not at first.  It might take some time until your boyfriend's mom trusts you.|`|6MPTPYDOaa	just meet her. its important to your man that you meet his mom. It's no big deal... well it is, but still... just face the fact that you'll need to eventually if you want some kind of life with this man. Maybe the mother doesnt like you because you wont give her a chance. I mean, come on. she may think you have something to hide... and thats not good!!!|`|brcuJxkdaa	JUst go meet his mom his dad likes you so why wouldnt the mom?<br>  If she doesnt like you then just suck it up and dont hang out with his mom|`|QilfSBfsaa	The problem is you have met his dad, I think his mom is jealous also thinks that you don't respect her.|`|1iXvphNYaa	Meet the mom. Geez! She did raise, along with his dad, this WONDERFUL guy you're with. Peace. :)|`|4wQffufZaa	i would suck it up and go meet his mom<br>  MAKE her love you!<br>  :]|`|hnyyPqixaa	i feel the same!! i think that its our decision to decide when we feel ready...just dont take to long|`|4iT5OzsCaa	Being that it's been six months, perhaps that's why he get's hurt about it, I mean that's a fairly long while without meeting her, and she probably doesn't dislike you, perhaps she's hurt aswell, you met his dad, her husband, and not her, I think you should go and meet her, and it will make your boyfriend happy, and probably make his mum happy aswell..
8171f13a66f57e41aebf7a632c883e24aa	I've had something like that in the past, very very similar to your situations. My ex and I would argue badly, it was our rough times. I would forgive him each time there was name callings or him putting me down. It's hard to forget those kind of things because eventually it creeps up on you and makes you a bit paranoid on whether or not the guy would do it again. We were going out for almost 3 years. I always saw him in my future also and wanted him in my future. I made the decision last year to let him go, because it was non-stop frustration and stress with the carried arguments. <br>  <br>  If your bf makes you happy and you can forget all the bad arguments and such, I say go for the forgiveness. If not, it's not worth stressing yourself out. You should be with someone you can "Trust" and can make you feel happy.  <br>  <br>  Sorry for your situation ):|`|OaSkUoZBaa	I think you should meet his mom!
8yGLf3Byaa	cry me a river, build me a briddge, when ur done GET OVER IT, stop being such a ***** and ask her out|`|1wR0rBVYaa	it seems like you really like her, and thats totally fine!<br>  <br>  hang out, and tell her how you feel, see what she says.<br>  <br>  get a hobbie though, that way your not thinking about your all the time. if you out doing stuff your mind wont be on her. if your at home ull be thinking of her.
KO4kkypnaa	Yes. If you don't ask her out soon she is going to think your relationship is a. fake, b. a joke, or c. not going anywhere *which it isn't* Girls like to be pampered and taken care of so definitely ask her out! If you are going out its your duty to treat her well so take her to dinner and a movie or ice cream or something before she loses faith in your relationship.|`|Nhi8cxAvaa	Well Duh! <br>  <br>  DO IT! DO IT NOW!|`|KU0C99muaa	absolutely! ask her to a movie or out to dinner!|`|yw7M6ZSCaa	no...<br>  dont make your move too fast
Ikd9cppcaa	Well, I would look for another girlfriend. The worst thing that can happen to you in high school is to date one of these gossip girls with the girl friends. Everything you tell her, she will repeat to them, and they will tell the whole school. Just find a different girl to like. This one is too immature and will not give up her girl friends to have a boyfriend.|`|W3hAzpHaaa	yea...man up ...lol|`|JEN7wDrfaa	get her to be wrapped up in you make her interested in show her lots of attention|`|1wR0rBVYaa	get her number ask to hang out.|`|CIKr28xoaa	leave her your number..
qNMfaJ4Raa	It's human nature to be horny and have the desire to reproduce. Blame science.|`|XU9kfVmKaa	you sound like fun to hang with :) lol jk umm to tell ya the truth maby your body needs sex who knows|`|OaSkUoZBaa	Go get you some girl ;)|`|w6DJj1a8aa	yeah girl me too!!!!! ewwww i know but yeahhhh i'm horny too!!!! like i want to do it hahahaha =)
AA10953999	Welcome to life! People are not the same, some people need you when its convenient for them. Stop thinking about her or you will feel miserable. I've been in your shoes so trust me when I say it's not worth losing sleep over when she could care less about you. Just go about your business and concentrate on your life.|`|euQFQzc5aa	Certain woman will disapear from your life as quickly as they arrived. I've shared a similiar experience.<br>  <br>  It's life. Concentrate on what tomorow brings.|`|JhvqUvlsaa	Focus on other friends and what you need to be doing; I know it's hard but you'll have to; and it will kind of happen naturally. Since you won't see her in person again you will slowly start to get over your obsession.|`|8613318f79b2710303ce6007180c4ddfaa	maybe what you need to do is hang with your friends there and go out try and have some fun get your mind off it. hey instead of talking on msn write her a letter. or maybe she's not the friend you thought she was if she has no problem moving on or whatnot just talk to her about it and try to resolve this issue..my thoughts are with you..hope everything works out|`|XJ6RxMQIaa	Meet friends in your current location!|`|71fc8cbea5928669e06e7c42a2dd8046aa	It amazes me that everyone thinks that the other person has just totally forgot about them, like they never existed. Thats a load of crap, your friend, if she was a friend probably misses you just as much as you miss her. Some people just dont show it.<br>  <br>  She is only doing what you should be doing, making new friends. Just because you two are apart doesn't mean that you aren't friends anymore. I have a friend that I only get to see once a year, but I know that we are still as close a friends as we always were.<br>  <br>  Trust me, your friend feels the same way you do.|`|uqmkagONaa	it will get worse before it gets better, but don't worry. You just miss her extremely, and the time difference is a very hard obstacle i know. You're very fond of her, but if you stay in contact you can be close friends :) <br>    if you just expand your friendships and try meeting new people where you live, then it will preoccupy your mind. Also try getting more involved in other activities that are more social or academic. I know it will be hard, but you can overcome it|`|5F9IPrMJaa	I'm in the same situation as you well I'm getting over it now so it's good. I have been best friends with a girl for 7 years. She moved to another state and forgotten about me, she's busy with her life there. But I'm the one who got stuck thinking about her. <br>  <br>  I found out when I'm really busy with work or school, I don't even think about her. So my best advice is to stay busy. Before studying if your mind is distracting you, STOP and write down your thoughts. When you write down your thoughts, then you don't have to repeat thinking that same thing again.
Mf5i0Hcraa	what reason would he have to cheat ?|`|Bgo0xmjnaa	Well duz he sleep wiv other women?<br>  I think that's the 1st sign|`|zPxzBd3oaa	check his phone calls

N7gOE1btaa	Everyone will at some point feel that way.  Sadly time heals all.  You just need to wait for the right person.  Its a cliche answer, but its so true.  I was 22 when it happened but I'd been wondering since I was 16.
DcrI9zmkaa	Simply stated, you don't.  It's going to hurt her no matter what.  Just give her the courtesy of being honest with her and move on.|`|EkRoSHzDaa	like i always say:<br>  sometimes you cant get out without hurting feelings. <br>  if shes into you then shes gonna get hurt.<br>  the best thing you can do is be open and honest about how you feel.<br>  and besides, if you want to be with someone else its better to just do it, because your only hurting your relationship with this one girl and are gonna end up hurting her more later. and your not even gonna be happy if your always thinking about another chick that u like. so just do what you have to do, just do it maturely in the best way u know how and thats all you can do.|`|19iD220Jaa	Its no way that you can DUMP somebody without hurting there feelings. But just be honest and tell her that you don't want to hurt her but you have the desire to be with someone else. hopes that she respects your decision to not cheat and try to remain friends in the future..<br>  <br>  Good luck with your new relationship|`|WTGJg49Jaa	Just tell her the truth i am sure she will one day appreciate you for not wasting her precious time in finding her true soul mate. But still, she will go through a bit of a mourning period but everyone does. But then again i have now idea of you girlfriends personality and how she would react to things.|`|YteCvUZJaa	"Its not you, its me" ? But that's lame. If your girl friend actually likes you, she'll be hurt either way. If she doesn't, then she'll most likely just get over it all.|`|aWa5yBeUaa	honesty is not the best policy. u'll break her heart if she knows the truth. do the whole cliche' its not u its me thing. she'll walk away hating u, but at least her dignity will still be in tact|`|Ue8YX32kaa	Just dump her and hurt her because that is what men do best; hurt women.|`|o4HFxYG5aa	Just say <br>  " I'm rick james ***** "<br>  and walk away.|`|eeaXYyCNaa	Just tell her you think you would make better friends.  Tell her you see her like a friend and not a girlfriend.  She is going to get her feelings hurt but, at least this way she thinks you still care for her your just not into her like that.|`|0O8DUzCdaa	There is no way to do it without hurting her feelings but its even worse to be with her and not like her|`|qNWqdAclaa	There is no way to avoid hurt feelings. But the best thing to do is to do it fast and get it over with. Don't string the girl along just because you're afraid of hurting her....that will hurt her more in the long run. <br>  <br>  I'd also advise you not to tell her that you like another girl. You can say you want to date other people or move on and what not....but don't tell her that there is a specific girl that you are leaving her for. She'll start to ask herself what's wrong with her...why is this girl better, etc etc. <br>  <br>  Keep it short, and quick.|`|17e9dd5261b81da256fe99427e074568aa	It's impossible to dump someone without hurting her feelings. Just take the hit man, tell it to her as it is and then get ready for the worst.|`|Nhi8cxAvaa	Dude, that's not possible. You are going to hurt her.|`|8fc631e41ad2374db0b841af558ea19faa	no way to do it without hurting her
DcrI9zmkaa	See, here's the thing...*this* is why she broke up with you.  She *told* you that you are too clingy, and you're proving it by focusing on nothing but how to get her back.<br>  <br>  You need a hobby, my friend.  You need to get out and live life.  Stop worrying about how to get her back and start filling your mind and heart with things other than this girl.  There's MUCH more to life than her.|`|VRjIZKOCaa	Sorry to hear about that mate.  We've all been there.  If she's being truthful with you and that all it is, is that you're being too clingy or around her too much, just explain that do you really care for her, but you are prepared to step the contact hours down and give her some more freedom. <br>  <br>  See if you say that and she still reckons no, then she's not being totally honest with you.  So you've got nothing to lose.  <br>  <br>  Hang in there buddy, keep your chin up and remember that there will always be other fish in the sea if this doesn't work out.|`|zS98HYNiaa	If you really feel you want her back.you needa give her ,her own space.you guys dont need to be together all the time,you guys will start to fight and it gets annoying.tell her you'll give her ,her own space and ask for another chance,buy her roses...something romantic.<br>  hope i helped :}|`|A1rfDaANaa	you if she said that then juss try and not talk to her for awile even tho you love her because if you just stop talking to her and ignor her she will notice how much she actully needs you
v5DXPUjMaa	Before you cast off all men as ignorant jerks, let me just tell you there are still some of us nice guys out here. And I actually agree that a lot of men are idiots. Too many of them are looking for "booty calls" rather than relationships and don't care about the consequences. I think us guys could all use a refreshers course in Chivalry. Which, by the way I don't belive is dead.|`|qruLJke6aa	maybe you shouldnt be so damn uppity!<br>  or switch to women|`|BitAsc8daa	I know of very few good men.  The good looking guys either know they're good looking and act like snobs, or theyre gay/taken.  The ugly guys are either too ugly or know-it-alls or insecure.  The average guys are just that - average.  Some guys are really nice, but it seems you have just had bad luck.  If your husband is a jerk then leave him.  Leave him and move to another town.  Find the guy of your dreams and don't settle for a jerk PLEASE you dont get to re-live this life.  It's your only shot at happiness and you will never live again.

b7bb85526b028b7f92b16c8204ed4012aa	Sometimes when couples fight they say mean things to each other like divorce and leaving and such and nothing happens. Other times marriages do end. The biggest thing here is its not your fault that theyre fighting or whatever happens. Now by you getting involve in the middle of these fights ,you risk them turning on you, you escalating the fight, etc., so it is best to stay out of it in the first place. No child likes to see their parnts fight but it happens sometimes and there is no way ever the child stops it. All you can do is afterward tell them how you feel when they fight and/orlet them know you love them both and will be there for each if they need you. This is exactly where Angels even fear to tread and its not your duty to break it up. just go somewhere whee you wont have to listen to it. Sometimes parents are actually worse than little kids when it comes to fighting and most of the time nothing ever gets accomplished by it. Dont interefere., and pray for them.  Good luck

But as far as him wanting to stay married?  No.  He feels guilty when he comes back because he feels pressured to for whatever reason.  Maybe it's because of the children, I don't think he wants to hurt them.  <br>  <br>  But he has.  By acting the way he does, by hurting you, he hurts the children.  I hope that you think about your children's well being.  And that you love them enough to realize that this situation is not working, and they're getting hurt in the process.  <br>  <br>  Love yourself and your children enough to say "I deserve better" and walk away.  It must hurt a lot, especially because you've been married, I understand.  But, the relationship's broken, you have to be strong and let it go.  <br>  <br>  You have your children to live for and they can give you all the love in the world.  <br>  <br>  And always remember that a guy isn't everything, you can be mighty fine by yourself.

hWvvrEphaa	I helped out my ex this way.<br>  <br>  You can download programs now (I'm sorry I'm not sure of their names but you can find it if you look up something like 'stop watching porn today' or something). I think one of them is xxxchurch or something...anyway you install it and it prevents you from watching any adult content. My suggestion is that when it asks you for a password type in random letters/numbers and then copy and paste it in the next block so you cant change it yourself. <br>  <br>  I don't know if you're a christian or not (not trying to force my beliefs on you) prayer works. Every time you feel like watching it say out loud. "no. I wont do this" and leave the room for 5 minutes. And repeat, after a while the desire to do it will stop. <br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|R5hcAgwLaa	hahaha get a **** buddy or a girlfriend or something, they can beat your meat for you|`|BpL6VZV3aa	get rid of the internet! and all your mags and videos and dont do it!|`|90TmFp5Qaa	maybe a counselor can help you.|`|zPxzBd3oaa	replace your urge to watch porn for something else, call a friend or something, take your mind off of it|`|AA11678629	have yourself neutered|`|OtKCAeQZaa	Pray and Pray always for strength to over come this addition.

Just start going to bed with out it once in a while and slowly you wont be addicted anymore.|`|7SNPAJm4aa	Pray.|`|ENl3pqnGaa	to quote the nicorette ad: "cut doooowwwn and STOP!"|`|dUglyCKDaa	Through away your computer?|`|eO5sddfLaa	go to therapy|`|AA11121842	Make a list of many many things that you could do instead of watching it.<br>  Then, when you feel like you need to, take out the list and do one of the things on it. <br>  This will take your mind off of it, while also allowing you to be more constructive with your time.<br>  Take up a hobby, or create a new one//Get some things done around the house//Go for a run every time you feel the need to watch porn.<br>  Also, you need to have a support friend who you can count on to help you get through it, nobody can quit anything on their own, not even with the help of internet strangers with good advice.|`|VRjIZKOCaa	Hahaha that's classic. <br>  <br>  Well in all seriousness, the initial act of watching it is what has created the addiction; it is well documented.  <br>  <br>  Therefore, removing the ability to watch it will kill your addiction.  If you have to, start off by limiting your internet connection. If that's not an option, instead of spending so much time at the computer perhaps try to get outside or engage in another hobby.  <br>  <br>  Get fit, go walking, play sport, be social - do something to get yourself away from that computer/p0rn|`|TKwO2R8Qaa	either get a very "active" girlfriend or don't worry about it, its natural and what not. if you really want to stop watching porn, then i guess you could try doing it every other night, then once every four nights, and so on to wing yourself off of it. why would you do that though?|`|iuJfpyqHaa	um well just watch as much as you can in one day then do that for about a week straight sooner or later you'll be like seen it,seen it,seen it ,and... seen it. that will make it boring which will stop it...immediately|`|M9iOiYZtaa	get a girl..that helps...and get rid of your porn collection as well|`|QJOMStw6aa	Maybe try therapy or getting a girlfriend(assuming your a guy)  if you don't have one.

Go play video games or watch TV. Try it for a week and you will find that you don't have to watch porn at all. The problem with porn is that you will subconsciously expect every real girl to be a like the porno girls. What they do...how they look...their bodies, etc. You will never have a real relationship if you don't stop the porno.|`|AA11280073	Turn off the computer and get into sports. Join a gym. Go for a run. Keep your mind and body occupied. It's called willpower.|`|83844defcdcb7e19fa8aea7dad5a5561aa	I am glad that you realize you are literally rotting your mind if you continue to do porn.  But, to be brutally honest, it is NOT easy to simply stop watching just because you feel you want to.<br>  <br>  Porn is akin to drugs  or gambling - it becomes an addiction that you must address beyond just willpower.<br>  <br>  Fill up your time with some type of worthwhile activity. <br>  <br>  Play tennis with friends at your local Community Center.  <br>  <br>  Borrow books from the library and take yourself on a virtual tour in worlds of imagination - I like Science Fiction.  <br>  <br>  Go on long walks.  Ride a bike.  Jog.  <br>  <br>  Take up dancing lessons.  Learn karate or Yoga.<br>  <br>  Explore the countryside - go hiking, canoeing, fishing, camping.  Learn how to fly fish.  Learn to make smores.   <br>  <br>  Take up playing an instrument, like the guitar.   <br>  <br>  Fill up your time with any of these, and you'll find yourself gaining new vistas to live among.  You will find they are more enjoyable than porn, and you don't have to feel guilty any more.|`|8JU1hxZ1aa	Slowly wean yourself off it, find things to do so you don't have spare time thus you won't just be sitting around going "im bored what can i do..."<br>  <br>  Good luck :)|`|0lQtTE9Daa	why would you willingly stop using god's gift?|`|hXdt1lntaa	go to a rehab center

The best is if you take a look at the mannaquins in a storefront and see how they dress. Judging by your photo I assume you'd be more willing to try H&M, Zara, Gap, Banana republic rather than Urban planet or Guess...also wear fitted clothes and not too baggy...polos always look good on guys no matter your shape..best yet why dont you ask the girl in the photo with you to take you shopping??|`|3585617e66b6e408b3a748ee15238f75aa	Take my phone number.

It doesn't really matter what we think, after all!|`|gxsuXpP6aa	I don't think you're ugly, that's only the perception you have of yourself!  Corny, but true.  Everyone has had those types of feelings, they tends to consume us.  The way you dress is fine!  I don't even notice those things!  One suggestion is lay off on the beer... I'm assuming that's beer in your hand, and that can make you feel crappy if you drink too much.  I'm not saying you can't drink, don't get me wrong.  To me that's the only ugly thing in the picture is the bar.  It makes me think you'll be like "can you get me a beer?" lol.<br>  <br>  While you watch football. <br>  <br>  Anyway, you're too hard on yourself.

YIvIVvWFaa	"but geez... he WON'T LEAVE ME ALONE !! i've been saying NO for 2 months now. I am just tired !"<br>  If you think your present situation is unpleasant, just wait until you give in to him and get emotionally involved or have to worry more than now about losing your job or have various people disappointed in/angry at you, and/or your conscience (which doesn't seem too active just now) begins to bother you. <br>  <br>  "But then when it comes from me, he tells me to really think about it before making a move, so that I won't be hurt. "<br>  <br>  Here he is setting you up, so that if you decide to go ahead and have an affair and it turns out badly, he can say, "Well I warned you. I told you I didn't want you to get hurt, but you insisted," putting it all on you. What a loser he is.<br>  <br>  By the way, does that mean what it seems to, that sometimes YOU are the one who proposes having sex? THERE is your reason why he won't leave you alone. If you say you have thought it over and decided against it and you keep refusing, he will stop bothering you. Stop thinking about how you have feelings for him or he does for you. Since he is married, both of you should be trying to get rid of those feelings. Never see him outside of work, if you don't want to give in.<br>  <br>  "Also, he's my boss, there's no way I am losing that job, I need it for my studies !"<br>  That sounds like just a cop-out.<br>  Don't fool yourself into thinking that you should give in to save your job. No job is worth saving at that price. It would be the height of selfishness, considering what you could be doing to his family, and you would be doing something bad to yourself, too. <br>  <br>  Besides, you would probably be more likely to lose your job if you DO sleep with him. When his conscience bothers him or he loses his lust for you or catches the eye of a new potential sex partner for a fling, he won't enjoy seeing you at work every day. Save yourself! If he fires you for not sleeping with him, you will find another job.|`|AA10961538	have his wife beat the hell out of you like I did many moons ago and leave you layin in a ditch beside the road she tryed to contact him and I went over there and told her the next time I'd flat out kill her think about it|`|g6pqGjrkaa	Frankly speaking it is wrong on your part, nothing more.|`|wnb0EgaHaa	You are not in love with a married man.  He is giving you attention and you are buying into it, and attempting to make excuses (reasons) to proceed.<br>  <br>  If you are mature enough to state that you have "basic needs" and that's what this is about, there are plenty of single men who would be perfectly happy to be in a friends with benefits situation if you feel that's something you can handle.<br>  <br>  The whole context of the situation you describe has disaster in the making written all over it.  He's your boss, so he's out of line already for approaching you. You say you're not gonna lose this job - what do you REALLY think is gonna happen if you get involved and people (his wife especially) find out about your relationship?  Do you think he's going to protect you?  Think again.  He's told you already that he is willing to betray his wife.  You are already far less significant to him than her, and he has explained this to you in no uncertain terms.<br>  <br>  You're going to get hammered on the moral side of this already, so I'm going to try to stick to advising you with logic and common sense.<br>  <br>  1. Keep your work life and your sex/love life separate.  Mixing the two is career suicide.  <br>  2. If you want sex without a "committed relationship" attachment, be grown up enough to say that and establish it on your own terms.  Don't be a coward and intentionally involve yourself with a married man.<br>  3. If you feel your job is at risk due to his advances, it is possible that you are in a sexual harassment situation.  Look for another job, or file a complaint.  Giving in will not secure your job.<br>  4.  The fact that you keep referencing your feelings and his feelings tells me that you are not viewing this potential involvement rationally or realistically.  You're trying to justify it to yourself.  Stop painting pictures, and examine what is really there.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps you make a good decision, because if you are depressed now, you will probably end up devastated on many levels if you allow yourself to get involved with this man.  <br>  <br>  Choose the alternative.  Whatever it is, it's better than this one.|`|ekr6BBe3aa	Unless you want to ask his wife permission for him to try and fulfill your basic needs find someone who isn't married. Do you have so little respect for his wife and yourself that you want to become an adulterous whore. He is wrong to have an affair, but so are you since you know he is married.|`|QilfSBfsaa	I don't think you love him, you just admire your boss as you think he is a powerful man, I think you are an insecure person, and your boss is very nice to you as your daddy, don't be stupid as your boss already told you that he will not leave his wife, put more time on your study and you will have a very bright future.|`|9TaO8We4aa	You may be in love,but it is a forbidden one. No good will come of it. Find something else to occupy your time. Go workout, have fun with friends or something. If you find yourself needing the physical, handle yourself. Masterbation is a good thing. Helps relieve stress.|`|OtKCAeQZaa	Are you ready to destroy the heart of another women to please your own desires. remember that it is evil for anyone to take a married man or women away from a loved one in a relationship.|`|lckgvz2laa	Would you please get your heads out of the clouds?

He is full of it!! Secondly, are you ready for the responsibility of wrecking several peoples lives...yours, his, his wife's, their children....relatives...losing friends....If you are then go for it I guess!<br>  <br>  Tell him you have made your decision. You no longer want him to bring it up. You don't want to have a relationship with him AND you don't want to lose your job. Let him know that If he continues then you will have no other choice but to file sexual harrassment charges against him.|`|1TSMdgG1aa	You should've never even gone that route, that's very low.  Another woman's guy is untouchable......and a husband?  Do you want a scorned wife to come after you?  You're asking for trouble!!!  <br>  <br>  In case you don't realize it, you aren't in charge of the affair.  He is.  You're being completely used by this guy. In fact, think about what you said: "he tells me to really think about it before making a move, so that I won't be hurt."  That right there is your cue that you're in over your head with this.  Don't you think that what has been going on behind closed doors isn't gonna come back to haunt you at work?  He's letting you know that he will use his power at work to hurt you if you don't continue to be his lay.  Because let's be frank, that's what you are to him, a lay.  <br>  <br>  If the fact that dating a married guy is wrong (but it didn't click) his little threat should've been a tell tale sign of what's to come.  There was no reason for you to have even accepted to be in this situation.  If you just wanted sexual satisfaction, there are many ways that you could've gotten that without stepping over the line like you did. <br>  <br>  I hope that you learn from this experience and don't do it again.  Because whatever pain you're causing the wife right now (you don't think she suspects? C'mon) it's gonna come back to you.  Learn from this and grow up.|`|1hDhmql4aa	Why would you have to leave your job, say no thanks and keep working but if he is the ahole type that would make work life difficult then you may need to leave your Job asap!  Is he is this arshole then you are dealing with a creep!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  He is a dirty old man and even if you may not realize it you are being manipulated and will be used sexually and emotionally!<br>  If you have basic needs there are plenty of unmarried and uncoupled men out there that would have more respect even if you didn't want anything to serious.  I think you are confused about what you really want and need to make your life happy!<br>  He is telling you everything you need to know!  He is too old for you!  You can't make your lives together!  No matter what you do he will never leave his wife for you, not because he can't but because he doesn't want to! It's an impossible love!  It's your decision to see him again and both of your decision to hurt his wife!<br>  He is acting as if he is a good guy by saying that he doesn't want to create false hopes but he is because all woman who are in this position eventually fall for the guy and get hurt!  You are not special to him no matter what he says because after you there will be someone else, there always is!  You deserve better so stay away from unavailable men.  If you can't you will need to figure out why you can't be with someone who would set up a life with you and you only and love you in the way you deserve.  Maybe it could mean that you are afraid of commitment yourself!|`|ASq7LSggaa	what are u trying to be a home wrecker and ur not ready for a relationship come on he is married .....u shouldnt even be considering it because what if u were that wife and some little slut was trying to ruin ur marriage if he doesnt love his wife then he needs to leaveher but dont be the reason ur one of many girls people look down on their is no need to go after boyfriends or married men get a single guy....|`|eyOb1yLuaa	Both of you just want to use each other for your own pleasure.

You should be completely ashamed of yourself. If you're so worried about looking at yourself in the mirror, why did you ever sleep with your wife's sister? Too late now, you and your wife's sister should keep your mouths shut and never tell anybody about this. And stop screwing your sister-in-law, will ya. <br>  <br>  P.S. I just looked at your question again......it was your wife's sister you slept and not your own right?.....because if you slept with your own sister, that's just something totally different and you should contact Jerry Springer and be a guest on his show. lol.|`|2b4OFx5Oaa	You don't. <br>  <br>  You did it, you live with it.

If you are never ever going to do it again then don't tell her, only tell her, and i mean ONLY if she asks, if she does then she has a right to know, I know a lot of ppl are gonna disagree with me or even hate me for it but you have to think of this logically....but seriously man, her sister? you are gonna suffer with it for a long time, and if you can't handle the guilt tell her but be prepared to lose her, because i bet you anything you will. Oh just a btw, the rule only applies for when       it was unintentional and you feel guilty about it, i've been cheated on and it hurts a lot not only cuz they betrayed me but because they told me, if they would of just broken up with me and not said that they cheated I would of gotten through it faster.|`|PyxXp8tNaa	First of all You cheated and should feel guilty.. Just because you and her had a fight doesn't mean go bang another chick..<br>  <br>  If you feel that bad about it then tell her but you already know its going to hurt her and she may leave you but that's a chance you will have to take or don't tell her and live with yourself.|`|b0aedc9dd7e866ac9503c3e962e4170baa	There's no easy way of telling her...just sit her down and tell her what happened, let her know how bad you feel over it etc..<br>  Make sure you have some place to go in case she wants you to leave (temporary or permanent).  <br>  If you two decide to work things out, be prepared it's going to be a long hard road.<br>  Good luck.|`|QJOMStw6aa	Was it her sister or yours?<br>  <br>  If it was hers your marriage is OVER!!!

wck4MHREaa	This is a little quote I like to use on these types of questions; it'll set the mood. Taken from Roger Ebert's review of "Zack and Miri Make a Porno"<br>  <br>  "...you might feel funny around a good friend if you [bleeped] them, and a good friend is so much harder to come by than a [bleep]".<br>  <br>  Basically, think about it for a second. A romantic relationship will forever change your friendship with this girl, usually for the worse (if things happen to not work out). I'm not saying that people shouldn't be friends then boyfriend/girlfriend (the opposite, actually- a girlfriend/boyfriend should be your best friend). I'm just saying that there are consequences for this, and you could be risking a perfectly good, wholesome friendship for a romantic relationship that may not work out in the end.<br>  <br>  Talk to her first before you do anything. If she likes you and feels the same way about you as you do to her, then she might be game to be your girlfriend. But just remember, it's easier to find a mate than it is to find a good, true friend.

You're basing all these feelings on band songs appearing on shuffle!  Get rid of that music and don't even think about calling him.|`|AA11646474	If this truly bothers you, yes you should apologize. to apologize may not mean you have to start talking to him all the time. but if you want his friendship to be there, it may be good to have those feelings off your chest. I recently went through something remotely similar and i felt much better once things were settled and not left in such an angry manner|`|EkRoSHzDaa	i would suggest if you feel this way to call just to clarify your feelings and get some closure, but as for "apologizing" you have nothing to apologize for.

I have been dating a girl for the past eight years, and before we started dating we were best friends. Sometimes people worry about falling into the friend zone, and that is just something that you have to be aware of. Some girls like it when you are closer to them and some don't. I know that my girlfriend wouldn't date someone she hardly knows, because it freaks her out a little bit, getting close to someone she doesn't really know. If there is a girl you like, being friends first is always good. And sometimes you will realize that it is only her looks that you like.|`|9MkW40uoaa	YES!<br>  <br>  it really is important the relationship doesn't feel pressured...so if it gets serious too fast for the girl she might wanna bail.

3d6728f78c0ece06bd14145aac2b6269aa	Hi. It will get better but I would be lying if I said that was going to happen quickly. There is a website called www.beendumped.com where you will find a lot of people in similar situations who you can talk to. I found it was a great help when I was going through a bad time. I wish you luck|`|RC8Pxx8eaa	Ok lets get this straight, what have you done wrong ? He cheated and he hurt you how does that make it your fault ? if you cheated on him would it be his fault or yours ?<br>  Get a grip and get rid of this guy he sounds like he has more of a relationship with his penis than he does with you.<br>  It gets easier in time if you let it get easier if you want to wallow in self doubt and self pity then it will last as long as you feel this way.<br>  I hope you realise that this guy is incredibly selfish and does not deserve you, once you start believing in yourself instead of him, you will win the day.<br>  Get over it, be strong and move on, guys like this are 2 a penny and do not come close to what a real man should be like.<br>  Good luck and stop feeling sorry for yourself.|`|X7i59NeIaa	Eventually, You didn't do anything wrong. You need to talk to your partner and find out why he/she cheated on you. You then need to decide if you can forgive or not. If you can't then you have to move on. Either way it is not easy.|`|817zMS41aa	Does your partner know that you know?<br>  If so, what was their reaction to getting caught?<br>  <br>  I ask because these things will help you move on.<br>  <br>  If they know and are sorry then when you can forgive them, things will slowly get better.<br>  <br>  If they don't know you know or are being cruel then you are going to hurt longer and it will pain more. However that will also pass as time goes by.<br>  <br>  It will get better but it will never be as it was between you. Betrayal leaves deep scars that rarely heal. They can become hidden but they never go away.<br>  <br>  Hard as it is, it all comes down to you and how you feel about the future of your relationship with your cheating partner.|`|PshRhxqraa	It does get easier but you never forget.  It happened to me over a year ago and I am still waiting and hoping for a day that I don't think about it at all.<br>  <br>  There is nothing like that raw hurt when you first find out/are told though.  That does pass, and relatively quickly.  Within a month you will start feeling as though you can cope again, and that is usually when the anger sets in.<br>  <br>  Have a look at all the information on the internet (survivinginfidelity.com) - just knowing the stages you will go through, and reading about other people's experiences helps enormously.<br>  <br>  Don't forget that you are a wonderful person.  It isn't you who has chosen to do this to your relationship.  Treat yourself to some beautiful flowers, some new clothes, go out for lunch with your girlfriends.  Think of all the fun he has been having recently without you, and go out and get some for yourself (I don't mean cheating of course, just normal girly fun which you probably haven't had for a while!).<br>  <br>  As you begin to 'find yourself' again, things will get easier I promise.  Remember you will never feel as low as you do now, so things can only get better.<br>  <br>  Give yourself a big hug, a good old shake down and pick yourself up.  Then you have to decide whether you can live with this knowledge or whether it's time for a new start.<br>  <br>  Good luck, whatever you decide to do.<br>  xxx|`|D33VRTz8aa	If you have done nothing wrong then there is no reason for you to feel this way. Confront him and let it out. <br>  <br>  This is the only way.|`|4t61VhBlaa	My beloved husband had an affair this past october and did it in the most hurtful way, especially because it was so surprising and out of character for him. The negative feelings will get easier as time passes, give yourself time to grieve, listen to others experiences and be strong. Talk to your partner calmly and try to discover why it happened. That will help u decide if the relationship is worth it. Good luck to you, don't ever blame yourself for someones infidelity!|`|6VYzHD51aa	Nope . Not until your gone .

Now, we have a beautiful little girl and he works a full time job and supports both me and our daughter cause we can't afford childcare right now. He has made my parents change their opinion of him sense we got married and they got to know him. So don't let your parents control your love life. It's not right for them to do that.

If u want her back, go get her.  Try to reconcile and have those long talks on the porch regularly.  REGULARLY I said....|`|X7i59NeIaa	I think the two of you really need to talk. Why did you get divorced. Is the bitterness because you still love each other? I would say you will meet her for a drink only if it is nonalcoholic and the two of you can really talk about how you feel. Take it one step at a time. Take it slowly and make sure you each know where the other is standing. Sounds to me like she would like to try again.

Tell me this, if you guys went through the motions and still couldn't save the marriage, why would you want to spiral back down that path because she has the "hots" for you now?<br>  Like I said RETARDED.....(thumbs down get just as much recognition as thumbs up---thanks for noticing ----WINK)|`|b7bb85526b028b7f92b16c8204ed4012aa	No confusion here. Theres still alot of feelings here for each other and shes now having second thoughts about whether the divorce was the right action to take. Her life isnt what she expected so she wants you back again. So now  its up to you as whether you really want her back in your life or just move on and start anew. Just remember to resolve any prior problems first or youll end up right back here real quick if you decide to take her back. She will have to deal with the boyfriend on her own, but that should be no big problem if she truly wants to come back. Use it as the ultimate test here. Good luck|`|ASq7LSggaa	she clearly loves u and u love her i think u guys could make it work i wouldnt worry about her current boyfriend because he doesnt know her like u do and u will always have a spot in her heart go out for drinks and see where it leads ;]|`|1MnNVa8qaa	Sometimes it takes seperation to realize how much you love someone. when you see life w/o them you realize that they made you and that all the bitterness and reasons for divorce were simply because of lack of communication. It's like a committment on paper or with kids changes the circumstances of love. It becomes a duty almost becuase everything relies on you to make it work. If you want to do this again I would. What more could you loose ya know? Date again. Be carefree. No like you are going to mess anything up. Start over. Renew vowls.|`|736f4c2d0f80c01ae125e1a7f95e6540aa	Obviously if you did not get along to the point that you needed a divorce, it probably wouldn't work again.  But if both of you want it to work, I would definitely seek counseling.  Do not go out for drinks if there is no way that there is anything there, because it may give your children ideas that Mommy and Daddy are getting back together and really hurt them when you don't.  If she only wants you for a drinking buddy, or someone to fall back on after a relationship fails, it will only lead to pain for your entire family.  You need to SOBERLY sit dow and talk about it with her more than one time.<br>  <br>  If the two of you want it to work, you need to get to know each other again.  What were the reasons you fell in love with her in the first place.  A good place to start may be the Love Dare book, the devotional spin off from "Fire proof." It will really help you if you want to build a strong relationship and get back together.
AA11299079	Yup.... he's gay.|`|Bx7F9jscaa	Just talk to him calmly about it. Say, "I found this on your computer. I'm not really sure how to feel about it. Please explain to me why you're doing this." or something to that effect. Good luck.|`|WchGezIAaa	Dont be scared.<br>  Psych yourself up and confront him.<br>  Guys or girls, he is still cheating on you, or trying to.<br>  <br>  Have some self pride, add a sprinkle of indignation and go for it.<br>  <br>  if your worried about how to start, its simple,<br>  when the moment arises, and you will know whan it will, just say<br>  "I was looking at the computer yesterday..."<br>  and go from there.<br>  <br>  let him explain if he can, and talk it out.<br>  dont let him push you around. remember, your the one thats been wronged here.<br>  <br>  Good luck yeah?|`|wHgBnMipaa	I would just tell him that you've learned some information that has disturbed you and that you are confused and upset.

I think you shouldnt be upset with him when you talk to him.. stay calm and try to talk it out. if you love him, you should try to support him and be a good help to him.. just talk it out and if he denies it, let it go..but i suggest you leave him to ease the pain..|`|fsxFebCOaa	Dump his f@ggy *** and get a real man!

zzaScg0haa	There is no real need to ask her what her orientation is, what you should do is ask her to hang out with you outside of school, maybe get coffee or something and spend some time getting to know her
9ByGtWiuaa	This is a tough situation.  It is only natural to feel attached to the person you love especially after 8 years of an on/off relationship!  SO, if I am understanding this right, your girl is leaving you and going to college by herself?  It sounds to me that she is giving excuses to break up by saying she "doesn't know what she wants" and "doesn't know who she is."  Often times, going off to college means "finding oneself" and being a girl myself, I think she wants to experience life without you, at least for awhile.  If she is leaving the city/state and will be far, it will be difficult at first but if you are both meant to be then she will come back to you.  In the meantime, hang in there and think of this time as a time to "find yourself" and experience maturity and life without the girl.  Keep in touch with her to remind her that you care for her and like I said, she may come back to you - it just won't be as soon as you wish.  I wish you the best!|`|USn04b4Paa	it depends whats going on in her head ,if it's about who she is trying to figure out who she is and it not who she wants to be with then she probably just is doing just that .she probably having a hard time communicating with you and she doesn't want to difficult your life by her being confused at this time ,so give some time to figure out things|`|HQb4wL1Eaa	It depends on the women and what kind of relationship it is. Most women as well as men will sooner or later realize that the relationship is going no where and will move on. Some will stick around for a few years but eventually if the man does not decide on what he wants a women will leave. Why be with some one who MIGHT want to be with you?<br>  If it has been 8 years and you guys are still having this problem then its over, especially when you go away to college you meet new people and is easy to get over some one.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|rgCWPPLmaa	You can't lose anyone worth keeping :)<br>  <br>  If she's right for you, she'll come back to you. if not, it's not really a loss, because (I know this sounds corny but it's true) you'll be free for someone new who wants you just as much as you want them.<br>  <br>  I know what it's like to lose the love of your life. You have to remember that she is *not* your life, she is *not* your world, YOU are. <br>  *Needing* someone in order to be happy is a recipe for disaster, so do yourself and her a favour, and learn to be strong without her. That way, if she returns, you'll be even more confident in yourself, and if she doesn't, you'll discover that life is beautiful with or without her.<br>  <br>  Good luck, stay positive, and I wish you both all the best :)
0rCnApDlaa	No dont give up he'll call let him work first and be a person that waits awhile. that mite be a really nice guy your just giving up on. the good guys come in time watch he'll call dont worry|`|ITucJoZ4aa	if he said he'll call back then just wait. He might not be worth the phone call and not call you back.|`|FBbkIYztaa	naaw! get chur mack on stalk his *** lol jp<br>  well pass by where he works ask <br>  him wen he has spare time to kick it wit chu<br>  do sumthin if u like him|`|KU0C99muaa	i wouldn't give up, but i probably wouldn't call back. if he says he's gonna call just wait it out!|`|g5hbtv4laa	Put him on the back burner.  Go on with your life and if he calls, go for it, but don't wait by the phone for his call.  Good luck.|`|Px990WYDaa	yea give up. if he calls you then great. but if you keep blowing up his phone hes gonna think your desperate. even if your really not.
6uEmRe7Naa	I would get something with a St. Patrick's day theme. If he drinks, maybe put together a few kinds of good beers and some Pub Mix. If he likes to cook, you can put together a BBQ type basket. I love this idea, <a href="http://www.bisketbaskets.com/blue-ribbon-bbq.html." rel="nofollow">http://www.bisketbaskets.com/blue-ribbon...</a>|`|6846a3395d16d18b95b001a1bda626a1aa	For the holiday buy him a green cashmere sweater.
Jjjg7jcraa	Wow! She's a jealous one! After a year....yeah it doesn't seem like it's going to get better. That's probably the way she's going to be until the end. It's not fair, and relationships these days should be 50/50. What's good for the goose, is good for the gander. If you're ok with how she is...then stay with her. But if you're not (and it sounds like you aren't) then get out. There are other fish in the sea...and plenty that don't have trust issues.|`|UobA5ebEaa	I am the same way and it is becuase we r insecure and then when u don't answer ur phone yes we will think that u r cheatin on us...Answer the damn phone and maybe she won't go crazy. We hate that. And maybe she's wants to have u and these other guys and she don't want anyone to talk to u cuz she feels like she is going to lose u|`|9syEUfnqaa	well jeez. seems like your with a raging psycho.lol..end it. please for all of us. I could name different reasons why but it would be too long. But for one..your allowed to have friends, shes too controlling and if you want to stay with her, then get prepared to live life on the slow and painful lane. you need to find someone that'll treat you better and not a hitler.|`|YIPIIXHlaa	Run like hell.|`|J5klazJTaa	Very insecure, you might wanna restrain yourself cause tha ***** is krazy str8 up lol....|`|0UjXRho3aa	we all get jealous at times but that is just way over the top.<br>  <br>  she is nuts. i agree. run.<br>  <br>  x|`|GzhA93oTaa	she's a girl. simple lol. and i have watched girls i know act the same way. i dont think she should act that way and its not veyr healthy for you to stick around and put up with it. ive been in that relationship witht he guy being that way and its not fun. she needs to grow up and she isnt going to do it until you put your foot down and tell her that you dont like how she is treating you and that she needs to trust you because obviously she doesnt for her own reasons which could be that she thinks your doing what she is doing. cheaters always blame the other person because they are doing it in the first place so they automatically assume its being done to them.|`|wI3AAkIoaa	She needs to be with someone who you are not.  The right girl knows how to trust.  There was a time when someone who did not answer their phone made me wonder who they were with or why they did not answer... now for the first time in my life I know I can trust who I am with 100% and have no worries.  For a little while it was not easy, but when you know there has never been a lie spoken you need to believe in someone.  Find someone who believes in you and you will find happiness.|`|dxMQAdndaa	It sounds like she is really insecure. Maybe you should try to sit down and talk to her calmly about how you are feeling. She is probably worried that you are going to leave her. However, you can't be with someone that tries to control you.
wHgBnMipaa	I'd be very suspicious, even though I trust my fiance.  That is simply strange, but maybe it was harmless if she was asking for your permission.  If she was going to cheat, it would probably not be so obvious.
f9sL3WgQaa	you need permission for the 12 year old step daughters custody parent... yes.|`|AA10961538	ya I think Id discuss it with him come on it's not something ya just up and do thats called stupid|`|b7bb85526b028b7f92b16c8204ed4012aa	Yes since she is your step daughter. A simple permission letter giving you custody and the right to take her out of the country during this period will suffice. Its more to give you the right to act on her behalf should anything happen. It also protects you if someone tries anything bck home like her real mother and it does happen.  Enjoy your cruise and have fun. Am jealous|`|E9onWPJQaa	Does he have sole custody? Come on now, this is common sense.
827993b38a683884568367c98043c28caa	A very nice note.  Girls have a much better ability of expressing their feelings.  If i were an english teacher, I'd suggest re-working the last sentence.  The base word "feel" is a little over worked.  Something like, "Sometimes it's difficult for me to express my feelings, but when I'm with you I'm riding the highs."|`|ulUBv22eaa	it sounds ok
DcrI9zmkaa	It's past time for you to move on.  While you're "letting another year go by", another year of your life is being wasted.<br>  <br>  Stop sitting around pining for her and go live your life!  Get out and do things...hang out with friends, find a new hobby, do volunteer work or whatever you like.  The key is to fill your mind with positive and productive things rather than painful and depressing ones.|`|4ZtAvYG9aa	There is no use in trying to run away from all of this. It's not just your pain, it is her's as well. If you let another year go by she will also be in another year of pain and agony. Might as well confront her and try your best to resolve this. It will ease the pain in your heart and in hers as well.
ulO3556jaa	Talk to him !! tell him how you feel, and show him why he should be with you not her|`|19iD220Jaa	Yes you should <br>  let him know how and what you think and feel about him. <br>  Be prepared that your friendship will move to a different level and that could be a good thing and a bad thing.<br>  Proceed with caution and good luck.|`|NxLmvKtJaa	yes.  for a guy to be with you for that long, you at least need to talk to him, and let him know how you feel.  he might be waiting for you to say something. give him props for being with you that long, and not pushing you to go any further than friendship.
V5JJK8Okaa	take care coz he also cares for you. 0_o,|`|USn04b4Paa	he probably will ever see you again and he just saying good bye forever|`|TnIsuYqYaa	It means"look after your self" in a nice way.|`|ahujYDBdaa	Take care of yourself, dont do reckless stuff.|`|jvKazMgwaa	well he means that you should do exactly that.|`|QFf9phAmaa	it means beware|`|l9LL5xOvaa	Usually a Good-Bye that means you won't be seeing each other for awhile.
DcrI9zmkaa	It means he likes using your first and middle name... ;)<br>  <br>  (He likes you, too...at least as a friend, maybe more.)
AA11560052	Not necessarily, but possibly.<br>  <br>  Watch how he acts around other women. If he is this effusive with everyone, then most likely he's just a touchy-feely flirt. However, if he's somewhat more distant with other women, then he probably has some sense of affection for you, but whether it's a crush or just a good friendship, you'll have to judge for yourself. The best thing to do? Don't jump to any conclusions based on his behavior, but if this is something you want to happen, don't waste time pondering the nuances of his behavior. Just make your move. Trust me, things happen this way.|`|XasLRQnXaa	yeah, unless he's gay. He could of also been raised to kiss girls on the cheek as a sign of respect when saying hi/bye.|`|4g1N02Bwaa	Most likely.
007bGnYlaa	he thinks your cute if u like him give him a complement|`|ljpBWNMPaa	He's really into you.
eluJK5nUaa	I agree with the first two answers, and your idea. It's u and her bros business, not really hers. I honestly dont understand why'd she be mad, something he said, or you said? idk! Try to ask her wats her deal? At least try to figure that out and resolve that. Hope i helped!|`|ZGydteQgaa	drama drama drama.... tell the chick to back off.|`|kfNBVZH6aa	Ignore her! She has no right to be mad at you for going out with her brother! ..Good luck.
o6xLWwZvaa	I am also tomboyish. I hate pink. I really hate pink. I don't like shopping. I don't have one girly outfit. All I wear are sneakers. The only dresses I have ever worn are my prom and wedding dress. Yet my wedding dress was from hot topic and it wasn't white. Pigs would have to fly first to get me to wear a white typical wedding dress. I'm also an outdoorsy type person. I like hiking and camping. Not afraid to get my hands dirty. I used to help my father work on cars. <br>  <br>  I met my husband 11yrs ago. I was 16. I was into wearing baggy jeans and tshirts. Back then, I wore my husband's jeans and boxers to school. Now mind you, he wore relaxed fit jeans, but I wore then on the baggy side. I have never ever owned a purse. I carry a men's wallet. It be the day in h*ll before I use a purse. <br>  <br>  Yet somehow with this personality of mine, my husband fell in love with me. He's not crazy about girly girls, he doesn't like high maintenance girls. <br>  <br>  Now I never been book smart, I am more street smart. According to my husband he has always thought I was pretty (and still thinks it).<br>  <br>  I have always had better luck at having male friends instead of female friends. It doesn't bother me for being the way I am. Screw those females who don't want to be my friend because I hate the color pink. My mother in law, and sister in law loves pink. They know how much I hate it. I told my mother in law, if she ever got me anything for xmas that is pink..I am giving it right back. (and I would).<br>  <br>  You're really not so different. You are who you are and you should be proud of it. One day you will find the man of your life who will love you for who you are. Don't ever change yourself for a guy. Be proud to be you. I know I am.|`|gMmnQ7Vjaa	haha i get along better with guys too but im not girly like all those other chicks! I feel the same way i mean my best friend is a guy named Daniel.i tell him EVERYTHING!I am tomboy tooo like i hate flat,heels even vans!I like converse and i like alot of rock(metallica,iron maiden,sublime,nirvana and more.) im 13 and i never am girly unless im making fun of the conceded chicks!hahahaha i never wore makeup in my entire life!!!!-not even lip-gloss.<br>  so u see there are alot of people out there just like you! hope i made you smile!<br>  :]|`|iRZ4Y2bLaa	Ok.<br>  <br>  I am exactly the same as you. not into the girly scene, liked by everyone. Follow myself and not others.<br>  <br>  it's ok to be different and a lot of people are afraid of that. Be yourself and never change to fit in, or to be a chameleon  like a lot of people are.<br>  <br>  There is nothing wrong to be yourself and you may find that other girls seem that you are weird, but just ignore it and keep your head high.<br>  <br>  Best Of Wishes!|`|ZMyABA8caa	I am a guy and I would rather prefer a tomboyish girl rather than a girly girl since it would be easier to open up to a tomboyish girl sicne she wud understand me better than a usually girly girl which wud have no clue why guys do things they do. So ur cool jus chillax. You will find a good guy for u eventually.|`|xAgK3w7eaa	I'm pretty sure that if you started to dress a different way your guy friends would notice but, they just see you as one of the guys.

Obv ur characteristic dont show that since u believe being different means looking different...<br>  <br>  i like girls with a funny personality and being tomboyish doesnt help...since u clam to be different it should be easy for you to find a unique style that makes u look pretty|`|6hJ5IM2Eaa	Don't worry... I thought I was diff too. There is a person out there that will love you for who you are. My opinion though is to not worry about relationships ... just have fun. Sometimes relationships are hard. If I were you I would let it come to you. Don't go out of your way to look for someone to love you. My boyfriend is the best. He is skinny and I am fat and we get along half the time but I didn't have a real relationship until I met him when I was 18. Don't worry be happy and have fun!|`|iYsLoUoDaa	Don't worry about it. Everyone is different and I mean everyone. If they don't like you for you then their not worth hanging around. You are differnet but in a good way. EVERY girl in the whole world is different. Lots of people feel the same way as you. I have 7 friends who are just like you and they all feel that way to. I try talking to them about how special and unique their personalities are and if other people can't accept that then their just plain rude. I hope this answer helps you so much.
loqsl5xXaa	i think this would be really sweet. you could recreate the place you met at. Or go there and recreate the scene. have dinner waiting with some flowers and have a romantic nite. <br>  <br>  you could give her something that reminds her of you 2.<br>  <br>   if you have a saying you always use you could have it engraved on something and give it to her. <br>  <br>  jewelry is always nice<br>  <br>  maybe not give her something, but do something for her.. like a spa day, go to the coast/beach,  take a mini vacation<br>  <br>   make the whole day a relax day a nice breakfast in bed and lunch with some flowers and dinner with romance.. then u 2 could take a nice hot romantic bubble bath and "relax" or just relax<br>  <br>  have fun|`|ab9d0d9ad5f495e6629d6147a4ea8894aa	A custom picture collage of your 5 years together :)  Congrats!|`|dxMQAdndaa	Jewelry.

2LDGlA1Paa	Forget Boy #1 ... he's already dating someone, which makes him off-limits, no matter what he says.  If he'd cheat on her, what makes you think he wouldn't cheat on you? <br>  <br>  Guess it would depend on what TYPE of bad things you have heard about Boy #2 ... but my gut reaction is to avoid him too.  At least don't go anywhere alone with him.   If you do decide to date him for a while, keep in mind that you're trying to see if he measures up to your standards and expectations.  <br>  <br>  Speaking as an old lady here .... you're young and have lots of time before you decide to settle on a single boy.  High School is supposed to be a smorgasboard of trying out boys to see what you do and don't care for in a relationship.<br>  <br>  HINT:  Get to know a guy's Mom because as cliche as it sounds, they really do tend to pick women who are kinda like Mom.  Also ... watch how he treats her because it's a preview of how he'll treat you.  Does he roll his eyes and act annoyed when she calls?  Uh-huh ... some day you're likely to get the same treatment.  <br>  <br>  Good luck and have fun .... remember you don't have to "settle" for anyone.  Take time to choose who and what YOU want your man to be.|`|BI1Ma4vVaa	Well to answer your question I would go with guy number 2. He seems like he is willing to be happy with you. Tp be perfectly honest (and don't take this the wrong way) but it looks like guy number 1 may be ashamed to be with you. This could be because of the age difference.

In all likelihood, given the age difference, you're not going to be even hanging in the same social circles, this guy is probably going to be pretty much gone from your life come the beginning of May. You don't mention how old Bachelor #2 is, but just giving the timing the first one doesn't seem realistic.|`|nwRforaZaa	try guy one, the reason he might be acting wierd is cause he noticed that there are other guys that like u. but at the same time pick the guy that is most likely not the kinda guy who plays around alot and stuff like that|`|c7KXSE1Uaa	it sounds like guy #1 is becoming less interested..maybe because hes not single....so maybe guy #2 would be best for now.but don't fall too quickly. those things you hear might be true because most of the time they are.|`|qTRlDKVgaa	the guy you think you deserve =]|`|CnclpZbxaa	try them both you never know what might happen

wHgBnMipaa	Tell her to back off.  Easy as that.|`|m5DpWaGJaa	in a car maybe? finger her, mess up her hair... haha i love that, bite her neck, bj, oral both ways, just be creative. you dont have to have sex to have a good time... go for the foreplay. just tell her you dont want to have sex till ur married and go have some fun. ^_~|`|1glG9a2caa	You said you want have sex till your married.If this is your decision tell her to back off. If its not ,you'll figure something out.
76imFZT4aa	Sounds like you guys are pretty young...considering the abv. cht. spk. <br>  <br>  but she's probably wanting to keep her options open. but you are right she is giving you mixed signals. and it isn't right of her to do that to you. it's a simple question yes or no. <br>  <br>  If I were you, I'd move on. She's obviously just trying to see if she can "hang on" to you. Chances are if she sees you talking to another girl at school she'll get jealous and want you back. <br>  <br>  Good luck :D|`|USn04b4Paa	it seems you both don't want to get hurt ,but you both don't want to let go ..it does seem you both like each other very much|`|UUQpz0Iuaa	Very complicated situation it seems like you guys both like each other though you both Just have to much pride and don't wanna look vulerable to looking like you actually care about each other.
bda6e2eaaccfe48b6f291b4d0b1b95b4aa	To be quite honest, she has no right to be angry, she's supposed to be your friend but she completely disregarded your birthday for another girls.  It's unacceptable, and to actually think you should -have- to attend someone else's birthday party on your birthday?  She's got to be kidding, YOUR birthday is about YOU and your friends should be there for you on that day just like you would be there for them on their own, would you not?<br>  <br>  You have a right to be selfish one day of the year, at least, and if you're not selfish sometimes people would completely ignore you, like this girl is doing.  I say you dump her and get better friends who will be way more understanding as to why you don't want to attend someone else's party on your -own- birthday.<br>  <br>  You need better friends, and you should tell her why you didn't go, and that she has no right to be mad at you for it.  Seriously.|`|QiPHesT5aa	Yeah, she's not a good friend. It'd be understandable if she forgot everyone's birthday--maybe she just has a bad memory and never remembers important dates--but she remembered her other friend's birthday, so obviously that's not the case. Not only that, but she went out of her way to do something special for this other girl, without even thinking of repaying you for what you did for her to make her feel special. You're not being selfish and she has no right to be mad at you. I think she has a lot of growing up and maturing to do. Drop her, and find yourself better friends.|`|ZBVHKmDeaa	Obviously this girl isn't a friend hun or otherwise she would have remembered your b'day and at least said happy B'day to you on the day, especially when you were a true friend and did the same for her not long before. <br>  I think this girl is just trying o play games with you. Don't waste your time getting upset over someone who obviously only worries about herself and also probably went to so much trouble for this other girl as a popularity contest not because she is a good friend to her.<br>  Just ask yourself these three main things...<br>  Do you trust this girl to keep your secrets and defend you?<br>  Does this girl bring out the best in you? (Such as your bestpersonalityy traits and etc) Or does she only make you upset and angry when you think of her?<br>  And finally, If you were stuck in the middle of no where and you called he, would she do everything in herPowerr to come help you in that situation?<br>  If you said no to any of these things, youdon'tt need her in your life and you should just worry about your true friends.<br>  Hope this helps|`|aNVA28uraa	bro i think she is not your best friend coz best friend are those who care u and remember all the things related with you. I f you remember her birthday then how she forgot. She remember another girl bday but not your how it possible how she become your best friend? best friends are those who always remember you in every walk of life, they never forgot u, they care about you, they care that he/she never hurt you. He/She share every thing with you if they have any problem or you are in problem. <br>  A person never be your gud friend who never care about you and never sincere with you.... anyway i wish u all the best....... <br>  i think it is right i feel to share it with you...
Pr2eOhliaa	talk to her, strike up a good convo. ask her what she enjoys doing.<br>  then use one of these ideas to ask her to do something.<br>  <br>  example:<br>  you "so what do you like to do when your not in this boring class?"<br>  her "i love movies!" or "horseback riding is my favorite thing to do"<br>  you "there is a movie ive been wanting to see, would you like to go see it?"<br>  <br>  its easy and makes things seem flowy. not super planned out. <br>  good luck =]|`|1xD8lVi4aa	Talk to her and completely be yourself.<br>  <br>  Dont be someone else<br>  <br>  Say Would you like to go outsome time and she will say yes or no<br>  <br>  take it from there, nice lunch then movie|`|XUSiJjZaaa	say i think you are a really cool person and i would love to spend some more time with you would you go out with me no the weekend to the movies<br>  take her to a scary or romantic movie it will increase  contact<br>  good luck
ZBVHKmDeaa	Do you only want to know because all of your other friends know or do you want to know because you actaully care about your friend and want to help if you can. If its only because everyone else knows then sorry but thats just pathetic and is probably the reason she hasnt told you. If its because you generally care, then let her know your her mate and if she wants to talk to you about anything then you'll be there for her, if she wants to keep her life private then its up to her and you shouldnt expect her to tell you. Sorry but just being honest. Think about how you would feel if you were in her position and someone wanted to know something about you just for the sake of it not because they actually care about you.|`|N6frEVbiaa	open up to her
x4Irx79Gaa	If your heart is set on him this much i dunno i wouldnt wanna move on and it will be hard.<br>  You should make a movee and look if ur tht close im sure it wouldnt be that weird if use brooke up , u guys seem tight .|`|AA11661497	I'm guessing you are too young for a long term relationship anyways. Play the field, act as he isn't there. Do what you want, with whom you want. It might include him, but maybe not. Don't get your panties in a bind over him. Have fun, explore, set what is out there in the big world. Play safe
4zu47qncaa	email the person back and find out if its her, damn dude dont make **** more complicated than it is|`|SRzL2Wexaa	I'd love it, but I'd want to know who it was for sure.  No guessing games.|`|YVdIs5B2aa	ummm i wouldnt reply until i was certain it was her cuz u dont wanna look stupid..... the next day if she stairs at u it prolly her|`|QFf9phAmaa	yes she is willing a lovelilo|`|gfynBnNfaa	hmm it could be her, does she write poetry a lot? how would you really know? i would email her back to know for certain?<br>  but it is cute she took the time and did all that for you.<br>  it obviously means you are very special to her.
3eSkFLB0aa	I met him when I was 13 and he was 14. He is my brother's friend and he had invited himself over to our house, hah. He spent the night all the time and it gave me a chance to know him. My mom told him I liked him and when I found out, I freaked out! He then started writing me poems and eventually asked me to be his girlfriend and have been together for almost 4 years. I'm now 17 and he's turning 19 in May (same month as our anniversary). We're best friends and I don't know how different my life would be without him.. (and I don't want to find out!) hah :)|`|nETF5rmJaa	met him when i was really little because his family and my family are best friends. loved each other ever since and are now dating after 11 long years
G0qkBsBkaa	Ya...its gross if you guys are just starting out but if its a long term thing its not as icky cuz you guys know more of each other.|`|NxLmvKtJaa	yes so if you drink a lot of alcohol, they'll get drunk too.<br>  <br>  if you drink a lot of coffee, your partner will get some of the caffeine as well and both of you will be up all night...... which may not be a bad idea|`|6lYwWb5eaa	It depends. Foods like onions...definately. Alcohol...yes again. To be on the safe side take a travel toothbrush and toothpaste with you when you plan to plant one on them!!|`|gqH6UkMdaa	YES!!!!! ITS DISGUSTING!!!! most of the time so chew gum or a mint after you eat|`|UUQpz0Iuaa	Yah sometimes its not that big of a deal though|`|b3YMLS61aa	only if its really strong like garlic just brush your teeth and use mouth wash and you will be ok.
C5bhtFXpaa	HAVE DEEP TALKS, cuddle, hold hands, go to the movies, get to know each other better (basically talk about your pasts and what you want your future to be like)<br>  <br>  <br>  In my opinion all of that is more fun than sexual stuff anyways. I mean don't get me wrong sex is great and has it's place but i just like connecting mentally and emotionally more than i like connecting physically.|`|ajNTSffmaa	Kiss for ever.  Mini Golf is cool, too.|`|4TqadRJYaa	movie and dinner<br>  mini golf<br>  beach<br>  mall|`|2KDvohPDaa	Come on sexual is good, n maybe i'll be fun...try it out..<br>  u'd like it too|`|NdwjkeNwaa	My boyfriend and I read books together, I lay on his chest and we listen to music and talk for hours, we cook and bake together, he rubs my feet :], stuff like that!<br>  I hope it helps!!!|`|mfiIgJY2aa	he wants to hang out alone because he wants sex. so just give it to him already. lol jk, i don't really know what you want here|`|5xuubN5Caa	Ummm...yeah watch movies, go out for dinner at a posh resaurant.|`|hRYwuCFRaa	dance with him... even if you can't dance. it's fun.|`|65jyxyz4aa	watch movies, play games? haha|`|A1rfDaANaa	go to the mall and try on clothes and let him watch and decide if he like or not|`|TEE4sJscaa	1)cooking<br>  2)watching a movie<br>  3)nature walks or walks on the beach<br>  4)playing board games with a group of friends<br>  5)washing a pet<br>  6)talking on the phone<br>  7)looking at the sunset or night sky<br>  8)art<br>  9)spring cleaning<br>  10)shopping<br>  11)reading a book together and have a long conversation about it<br>  12)play video or computer games together<br>  13) if in school, study or complete homework together<br>  14)eat together at a favorite resturant|`|VTGm3UNBaa	Bake a retarded cake. I know it sounds lame but "accidently" spilling stuff and being all goofy can be really fun. <br>  <br>  Go on a moonlit stroll with nothing but a penlight. He can pretend to be all macho and you can pretend to be all scared. Then pretend like your acting in some lame movie. Don't forget to randomly jump and squeeze his arm shamelessly!<br>  <br>  Build a tent out of blankets (yes like when you were young) and have secret adventures. Taking away all the adult constraints can be really enjoyable. Just have fun. <br>  <br>  Watch a movie that is crazy (like planet terror) and make it a drinking game (if your under 21 just get some really strong energy drinks). And drink everytime someone dies. <br>  <br>  Good luck! It's fun to do something weird and different
c7KXSE1Uaa	most of the time because they like to show them off!!!|`|WVrft2h3aa	naaa not me <br>  i think they're stupid<br>  its like basically saying<br>  i am owned|`|xCP1mybiaa	My boyfriend doesn't mind, as long as its just under his collar. It's hidden so he doesn't show up looking trashy at his work, but it is easy to show his friends, just by pulling his collar down :p
cQ7mKIP5aa	If you like him, when you see him, wave and smile.  Try to strike up a conversation with him.  Maybe walk up to him next time and ask him how he's doing.  If he pulls away, just shrug it off, and say I see you a lot and thought I'd say hi.  Sometimes an ice breaker with a casual friendly cool approach works best.  Maybe ask him if he still likes something you remembered he liked in the 7th grade.  Try to find out what his interests are now.  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.imdb.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.imdb.com</a><br>  Enter Marneen Fields<br>  in the Search Box,<br>  and Click GO!|`|4IwTGwpyaa	Try to fall in love with him.|`|bdiSM1UXaa	Try to build a friendship with him, start by saying hi..See where it leads you.|`|V8PjfdkIaa	Maybe you are watching him also. He could feel the same as you. TRy not to make eye contact if you arent interested in the person.|`|e100f51e7f2b1a2c0cc0785d7820a6caaa	I would approach him or sit with him at lunch and start talking to him again. Hopefully things will get better from there.|`|lD1B9pL7aa	kind of reminds me of my relationship with my fiance..lol.. I was the semi popular and he was the not so popular but regular crowd.<br>  <br>  did you ever think that maybe he feels the same way about you too? maybe you two like eachother but for some reason just don't know how to close the gap..<br>  <br>  it took me and my fiance four years of eye contacts, shy smiles, and accidental sightings of eachother before i finally got the courage to just ask him only to find that he has felt the same way about me all along too...<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK|`|d7ihBw4Qaa	You should try to talk to him, I sure you will find out that you both have lots of stuff in common. And you are not a reject, no one is, you define yourself as a person, no one else has the power to do that but you. You are a beautiful person, never forget that and don't let others define who you are ever!|`|w7HWpFxjaa	start talking to him and you will find out soon enough if you like him.|`|3GKybbYTaa	i think this happens all the time when you realize that somebody likes you. So, don't worry that he's following you, maybe it's just ur feelings...|`|ZGydteQgaa	Wow this reminded me of the  80's movie Sixteen candles lol|`|oLwj5cbWaa	Talk to him!
qrBR9Y9Qaa	No she was never married.<br>  People say she was so in love with Amitabh that after<br>  he got married to Jaya, she was in deep depression. Leading to<br>  her choice of not getting married. & Recently people say she's been<br>  in a relationship with a female. I don't know anything for sure. I think she's a creep. She looked real freaky in Om Shanti Om.
zW8tc64qaa	Well, I think it would be in her best interests to revisit the gynecologist idea. If there is a specialist that could relieve her of the pain, she should think about it. You have to convince her that it will be in her best interests (your method).

If ur ex is a player for real, you'd better tell your friend about it. I think that she'll understand that you want the best for her.
2b4OFx5Oaa	Honestly, you are in a state of "the grass is greener". Things change when you get married, this is a fact. Not everything changes for the better, and it sounds like your looking for the easy fix for this. Have you even talked to your husband about your feelings? It sounds like rather than working at marriage/communication, you look for what you think is the easy fix. <br>  <br>  The funny thing with your question is that the men in the question are interchangeable. Either one could have been your hubby and the other your male friend. <br>  <br>  Your playing Russian Roulette... Do yourself a favor and seek some counseling (individual) so they can try and sort out some of your fact vs fiction of marriage and your feelings.|`|0d23f051f113abf680e24047faa07d4faa	you are married. honor your vows.<br>  <br>  love develops, matures and become very deep with time.<br>  <br>  as a married woman, this is no time to try to be fickle like a fourteen year old.<br>  <br>  this is an opportunity for you to become seriously honest.<br>  <br>  grow up.|`|o6xLWwZvaa	When marriages lose that spark, then the honeymoon phase is over and now it's time to actually start working on your marriage. <br>  <br>  You can't just end it because there's no more spark after 6months and you like some other guy. You and your husband need to sit down and talk. <br>  <br>  Communication is the key in a great marriage. You need to tell him about your feelings towards this other friend. Maybe for all you know, your husband is wanting out of the marriage too. Talk, try some marriage counseling. If you both dont want to work out the marriage, then divorce before either one you start to cheat.|`|AA11391968	it seems like you never jad a serious dating relationship with man you didn't marry.  Was he interested in more than friendship with you?  You haven't been married very long and you will find marriage has it's cycles.  Be spontaneous with each other.  Don't give up yet.

I am not saying this to blame you but to help you understand that marriage is more than just the promise not to be with one person physicaly.  You are betraying that vow even if later you realize your marriage was a mistake.   You have a responsibility to your husband and should deal with him before you even consider romance with a new guy. You made your promise and so did your husband and you are responsible for that action!|`|T3b4I4kXaa	You really need think things through. Don't worry about the family's opinion.<br>  <br>  If this husband isn't the guy you want to be married to, you need to sit him down and tell him that you are sorry and that it is over. Cut your losses and cut him loose. Divorces are cheap. You each take your toys and go home.<br>  You don't mention your age, but it sounds like you really should stay single for a few more years. You have some growing up to do.|`|1TSMdgG1aa	I think you should place your focus on bringing the spark back into your marriage.  There was a love there that made you decide that he was the one, right?  So why not try and work on that?  Relationships go through ups and downs, maybe this is a down.  And it's up to you to bring things back.<br>  <br>  If after trying for a while you don't feel like you're ok in this relationship, then walk away.  <br>  <br>  Best of luck|`|TTjDATeOaa	Who's to say that when you get with the other guy you will feel the sparks still 6 months down the road. True love doesn't always feel like butterflies, but a deep warm trust in somebody. Stick with your husband, try to get the spark back! You owe it to him and to yourself!|`|XPPGphLbaa	You've been married 6 months - does your husband have a clue?  Does he no longer feel "the spark"?  What makes you think this 'other' friend won't turn out the same way?

I'm glad to hear you have not gone down the cheating path but if you stay in A marriage with no spark - how tempting will cheating be in 5 or 10 years?  You do not want to ever go down that path cause it is just weak and cruel to everyone.  You need to stop seeing your 'friend' altogether if you want to give your marriage a good chance, so you are not confused with the emotional impact of his presence.  You say you are not cheating but having an emotional affair with another man IS cheating in its own way and if your husband is not aware of how you feel then you are already deceiving him.|`|Htsa4B0maa	i'm in a similar situation as you. i wont ask you to forget your friend because it had been 3 years for me and it's tormenting. my husband is very good to me and I love him, so does my entire family.

Better to stick it out with the hubby (since divorce is expensive and emotionally hard) and try to make it interesting and bring that spark back.|`|yrnMxkB5aa	I think you need to look deep inside your heart and really figure out what you want. Looking for answers on Yahoo won't get you far, in my opinion. The question isn't really who should I choose, what do you want? Or rather, whom? If you truly are in love with this other man, then don't waste your poor husband's time and file for a divorce. It's not fair to him to be married to a woman that's only wondering if her marriage is a mistake. Keep in mind, your friend might not want you the same way you do him...i wish you luck friend.
ga7p1pBTaa	It means that he has feelings for you, but doesn't want to answer because he'll feel like he is cheating on his girlfriend.|`|c7KXSE1Uaa	yeah he prolly does like you. as soon as he becomes single you should ask again. =)|`|4g1N02Bwaa	It means that he likes you.|`|USn04b4Paa	yes he likes you ,but leave him alone he is trying to be a good boy

AdFucadgaa	If you think you can't live without him, then, pursue the relationship but you have to adjust in everything since he has a kid already. If for now, you are already seeing the difference, I don't think you both could go a long way.Think it a thousand times before jumping into this situation, your young, you have all the opportunities in life.
4g1N02Bwaa	Maybe you should dress and act more casual. Hide your wealth to get the good girls. Then they will just see how lucky they are later.|`|J5klazJTaa	And that is because they are materialistic. You need a female that is going to take the time out to get to know you.

Try blind dating...|`|4ZtAvYG9aa	Obviously with all the expensive items you wear, people won't notice you for your personality.

AdFucadgaa	Accept the truth that you are now not part of her life. She is now a thing in the past so whatever business she likes to do with herself is none of your business anymore. Its normal that you feel that way because you and her had a past before and maybe you just missed her but after you decide to part ways with her, you don't have already the right whatever and whoever she likes to be with. For now, go on with your life to avoid jealousy never mind them. Ok?
RQtYkwXgaa	Sorry but you are incorrect.  <br>  <br>  I have never cheated on anyone I have been in a relationship with.  In fact when I was separated from my ex wife (we were separated for 5 and a half years due to legal issues even though we had decided that we were going for a no fault divorce.) I stayed celibate (and did not even date) until after the divorce was filed.<br>  <br>  So yes there are some of us that do not cheat...  Nor have I ever helped someone else cheat.|`|F3LBgfvwaa	lol?

d4xvwTG5aa	You should remain friends with her and stay just friends, unless you think you'd marry her.. You need to work on getting some confidence (like you said) and then get out more. And the reason your stomach is churning is because you really do care about her and you don't want her to get hurt. <br>  Don't tell her unless you can see yourself the following ways:<br>  1. Be married to her<br>  2. Be good friends<br>  3. Be akward friends<br>  4. Rarely talk because things didn't work out too well<br>  5. Never speaking to her again<br>  why do I say that? because those are the most common outcomes of Relationships. Good luck!

If he can't like you for who you are, you definitely deserve better. Just tell yourself that, and you'll be fine. Men aren't the only things that matter in life, so please don't get too stressed over him. :)|`|Lg4LfxZyaa	move on girl, he is just a little tiny sentence in your book!|`|C5bhtFXpaa	l1.ike that other girl said, it's only a small part of your life. I know it hurts and we're all just being insensitive to how bad you feel right now but that's  not the case.<br>  It makes me sad that you're sad, it's just that i think most people have probably been through the same thing as you and we have all learned from that.<br>  <br>  2. That said, do what you like to do best to get over him. Don't pursue him any because he's not worth your time. Even if you do get back together you won't stay together and you'll only have to deal with this later. SOOOOO like i said do what you like to do. Watch a movie talk to a best friend. Draw horns on his pictures, wallow in self pity and drown yourself in a big bowl of icecream while watching a movie!!! <br>  OR you could talk to someone like me who you don't know personally so therefore you won't be embarrassed about expressing your true feelings. <br>  if you want to talk more my email is macsherm@yahoo.com|`|S0MOQGJJaa	ya, it hurts for a bit but it eventually goes away and you find someone better if you are looking for better... guys like him are still immature and don't know what they want...

a71def22ecf5cff0bc911b9f46353e8caa	It's just like any other dating site in my experience. There are some good people on it and there are some flakes, just like any other site. But I have met some really nice women on there. In fact, the lady I am dating now I met on Yahoo Personals. Even though you may meet some losers, or just strange people or people you don't really have much in common with, you are still meeting people which is never a bad thing. And even if you don't hit it off romantically, you just may become good friends.

But you cannot jump to a conclusion. What I would suggest is, talk to him and express how much he means to you and say how much it hurts you when he leaves you and walks off. Hope he would understand your feelings. But never fail to trust friends.In spite of that, if he doesn't understand the value of your relationship just don't bother for he is not worth it!!!<br>  Take care...

Or he likes to poop while you are brushing your teeth. Maybe his mom will dislike you. Babies are really expensive also. Have you ever taken care of one while paying for all the bills. Making sure the baby has all their shots and food. Never being able to go out whenever you want. Having fun when you turn 21. Never being with anyone else. I think you might be making a leap when you should take it a little slower. Just imagine all the things that could go wrong!!!|`|IbbQK960aa	Being that you ask this question makes me think that you  are not quite ready yet. Old enough yes, mature enough not quite.

9N6sW6KAaa	whats the question?|`|8juUgSK2aa	drink|`|1mJajydiaa	It seem u have a fear of discouragement somewhere inside. Look being frank in class is not that tough. A simple trick is to taking pre glance on the lessons u will study in classes that make u clear so u can raise a question. Never run from a group discussion it increases ur confidence.

A94u2In8aa	I might be a bit inexperienced to answer this question since i've only had one relationship so far (and a short one too) but if i were in a serious relationship and genuinely cared about the guy then i wouldn't have a problem being faithful to him.Yeah im being completely honest.|`|ISbCiVjGaa	For the right guy? Yes, if i did *feel* like cheating, im not with the right guy.|`|9c27503b79201fde467bfe0f1ef26915aa	I think any woman can as long as she feels her needs are being met.|`|x1FzJLwZaa	i can. i have been cheated before and it sucks. i know the feeling of being betrayed and i dont want to do that to someone who i love.|`|m2eHPeciaa	i can, if i felt loved and appreciated.|`|29mCE3V7aa	i think only 2or3 out of 100|`|6QgW0bkbaa	I've stayed faithful. <br>  Everyone gets tempted from time to time, but it's about choosing what is important to you.

4POGapREaa	Okay first of all it's not a suit if he's not wearing a tux or a blazer of some sort.  A jacket is what you wear in Winter unless we're speaking different languages.  So, he's wearing slacks with a dress shirt maybe?  Where are you getting married?  On the beach?  Courthouse?  I don't get it.  Need details.  Any guests?  Of course you want to coordinate colors.  It would look off if you showed up in a full blown white cinderella wedding dress & he was wearing pants with a button down shirt.  And how would I know what cake you should order?  Is the wedding fancy dancy or is it plain?|`|XPPGphLbaa	you are in the wrong forum|`|X8C9Zwj9aa	Consult a wedding planner if you are not sure of want you want for your wedding. All the details will be explained if you got one on your hand. Try to talk also with your partner with his mother about the complete plan.

XCk0IOQIaa	Tell him he's abnormal and that this condition will likely kill him in 6 years if it is not resolved. This will scare the ever-loving sh?t out of him and force him to adapt a stronger bladder, due to the fear that you have bestowed into his soul. Thus, it will make him stop wetting the bed.<br>  <br>  Either that, or tie his penis up so that he can't piss. Worked for my sister.|`|UwEEHuRcaa	I'd say no liquids at least 2 hours. <br>  But if he has always been ok and it's just this week, I think he has to tell his parents and go to the doc, he may have some kind of bladder infection. <br>  However given his age is it possible that the wetness he finds is actually semen? If it is, there's nothing the doc can do, it is normal, but your friend could wear underpants under his pyjamas.|`|vTToua1Maa	i had the same probem like 5 years ago,when i was 12-13 i used to wet my bed for 2-3 nights a week also i drooled..when i was 14 i fund out that im losing my both bad habits lol.. now I'm 18 and i have no problem at all..he doesnt have to tell his parents,just tell him to bear with himself,besides as I know theres nothing that he can do to stop that happening,no meds maybe|`|yFKh8qlYaa	Inform your friend that there is Nothing to fee shy to share this with your parents, better talk to them.  Collectively they can find a solution to it.  As Suggested by other friends avoid taking liquids min 2 hrs before going to bed and try to keep alarm for every 3 hrs in the night.  Slowly it becomes a habit he/she will automatically get up after few days.  If you consult doctors usually they give you medicine which minimizes the production of urinals during night time. But using medicine for long period may not be suggested.  I also  understand there are some electronic equipment available in the market which senses moisture, which you can tie to your thigh, it gives you alarm when it sense moisture.<br>  <br>  Bedwetting is not un common even in some teenagers.  He/She doesn't have to feel bad to share with his/herparents.  My sincere advise is let him/her speak to parents and do any thing with stress free mind during day, avoid feeling insecurity & be confident.|`|aNVA28uraa	say ur frnd that he have to go washroom daily before sleeping. and never drink half an hour before sleeping any soda/water/tea/coffe or anything else.|`|nFg5iqOLaa	LET HIM FACE HIS FEARS IF HE IS EMBARRASED MAN O MAN HOW BOUT HE FIGHTS A GUY AN LOSE WOULDNT HE BE REALLY BE EMBARARRASED YES!!!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  AN CAPS YES KUZ U OT TO UNDERSTAND THATS HIS FAMILY MAN!!!!!|`|MujCFUDYaa	he is feeling in secure. homeapathy got medecine for this problem

DBjqfg7qaa	So you are 15 and he is 35. Remember when you were 14, remember how much stuff you didn't know back then and how much wiser you became from then to now. What you don't know now is that, that keeps happening for many more years. In a year from now you will have changed enough to realize what a horrible idea this is. If you ruin a marriage you will come to believe you are a fundamentally selfish person and that will affect the relationship. Better to do things you know are morally right and feel good about yourself then you can have a good relationship with the boy meant for you and you can both start out together building a future.|`|zka26204aa	You would never be compatible sexually, once he hits about 50-60 years old.  It becomes difficult for many men that age to keep erections and ejaculate.  Also there is that danger of prostate problems at that age.  Plus, I can tell you from experience, that the body is not that great to look at, especially when the balls start hanging down to their knees, and the chest starts looking like he needs a beginner bra.<br>  <br>  My mother was married to a man 20 years older than her (my step-father), and she said that the worse part was when he got too old to keep an erection and she had to work for hours to get him off.  She said that she would get so tired that she would cry.|`|cJRFbZUaaa	Take it slowly and see what happens.  Age ain't nothing but a number!|`|AA10344737	It really depends on how old you are.  If you are under 19, I would say no.  The age gap is too extreme based on maturity levels.<br>  <br>  However, once you are over that age, it is more acceptable to date someone older than you.<br>  <br>  My boyfriend and I are exactly 10 years and my parents 15.  So, I don't have anything against it.|`|dFfQxy92aa	I am going to say bad idea.  Really.  Really.  Bad.  Idea.|`|kX6HCXf4aa	No!! stop now!!! Don't cause a divorce u stupid!!!

So number one:  she's not really a friend and number two:  of course she's going to do it to you again.  <br>  <br>  She's like Lucy from the Peanuts cartoon and you're like Charlie Brown.  Every time, good ol'e Charlie Brown thinks, "maybe this time she won't pull the football out just as I get ready to kick it" .... and every single time, Lucy does pull the football away so poor Charlie Brown lands on his butt.<br>  <br>  Aren't you tired of landing on your butt with this girl yet?|`|BitAsc8daa	tell her to get lost.  she broke up with u too many times.  move on.  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AoJkTJacgivvetmYHgQWW3bty6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090309181359AAXO7oB">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a> please please please answer mine?|`|lXsSmPugaa	uhh i dont think you should do it because the main reason is... shes playing with you. lets face it. she went out with you twice and broke up with you twice. wanna make that a third time? go for it. if u wanna save the third place for another girl. dont.|`|1ZuF9FdSaa	Risk a good friendship?  sounds like you two already were together a couple times and now you are good friends.

I don't know what grade you're in but talk to your school counselor and ask them for help to achieve your goal.

It's not easy facing these things in later life, either.<br>  <br>  I hope things work out for him, and I hope this is just a passing infirmity that can be fixed.<br>  <br>  But always remember: none of us is entitled to live forever, struggle as we might, and none of us want our absence to scare or frighten our beloved children. Your grandpa will always wish that you be strong. It is always a reminder that every minute spent with a loved one is precious.<br>  <br>  He is blessed to have such a wonderful grand-daughter as you. Share with him your love; and let him share his strength through you. <br>  <br>  Join with your family: your parents are no doubt equally upset. It is these times when families must come together. Let them know that you need them to be strong, too.<br>  <br>  That's all I can say. We humans are quite limited. Sometimes faith and love are all we have.<br>  <br>  Still, when I go, I want my kids and grand-kids to have strength, and know that I have appreciated their love and kindness.|`|loqsl5xXaa	oh, Sweetie (hugs).. i am so sorrrrrrrrrry. I have had many deaths in my family in the last 3 yrs and 5 yrs ago i found my step dad dead in a hotel room. my cousin who i took care of for her remaing yr died of a child hood cancer and she was in her 30's. for about the last 8 yrs my mom has had horrible health problems. you name it she has been tested for it. She had a triple bypass about 2 yrs ago. I was so freakin scared i was going to loose her. I mean she is the only family i have left outside of my uncle. i take care of my mom cause of her health probs and my uncle cause he is a senior and has a few issues. I dont talk to my extended family for other matters. They are all i have left. I know what it is like for you and what you are going through. I really really do. <br>  <br>  i have even had 2 scares myself. tumor removed from my arm and i was a victim of a hit and run. still recovering 9it was 3 yrs ago). they thought i could die or have brain injury and be paralyzed. <br>  <br>  there is no easy fix or solution to how you feel or how to control them. It is natural to feel everything even things you didn't think you could feel. It is ok to feel all the bad stuff right along with the good stuff. <br>  <br>  what you need to do is be strong for him. Love him like you do and always will. Be there for him no matter the situation. Act like there is nothing wrong with him. i am sure he doesn't want you to act different around him. normalcy and familiarity is the best thing for all of you. def. talk to him about how you feel and how he feels. let him know that even though you are young you can still cope and help him cope. let him know how much he means to you and how you appreciate every thing that he has done for you. <br>  <br>  it is very sad to loose someone.. you just always have to remember the good part and laugh off the bad ones. He isnt gone yet and you still don't know what he has. Most of the time it can be treated. Just love him now and show him. be there like u have always been. <br>  <br>  it sounds like you 2 have a great relationship and i am very happy to hear that. if you wanna talk or something email me and ill b happy chat. <br>  <br>  i wish the best out of this icky health scare...|`|c37TBRGZaa	situtations like these arise in everyone life . this is time when u should be strong enough & support ur grandpa with smile & make them feel that  ur with him . ur care & attention is the best medicine u can give to ur grandpa.|`|QE2hNXeCaa	I'm sorry you and your family are going through this. Be prepared to receive bad news but know that even if thing get complicated and your grandpa is sick things can be done to help him and there are reasons to be hopeful. Also, you never know, it might be a harmless growth. What you can do at the moment is communicate with your grandparents and let them know that you love them very much. This will cheer them up and you will feel closer to them. When things like this happen around my family I like to say something extremely corny out loud "in the end everything is going to be fine and if its not fine then it's not the end". I don't mean to preach but there is always an angle of hope and love to things. Best luck to you and your loved ones.|`|VF0t11Wgaa	first of all i would tell u do not panic. i know such situations are difficult to face but u need to keep yourself cool. be brave and prepared to face whatever comes your way...dear i faced the same situation 2 years back and it was my mom...doctors said the thing in her stomach may be cancerous but the reports confirmed it was nothing like that...i feared of losing her...but now shes completely fine ...enjoying life the way she used to... so do not worry keep your cool ...be strong and be supportive towards your family coz even they are going through the same situation ...take care|`|y3n0Ql6Paa	I am so sorry to hear this.  My grandpa was the one person I knew truly loved me.  He taught me to tie my shoes, to say the "rr" sound in Spanish, and many other things...So I know how this is hard.  With that said, please remember that no matter what happens, the memories will ALWAYS be there.  In addition, no matter what happens your grandfather will ALWAYS be with you.  I know my grandpa is with me every day..

It all works out from there.|`|BI1Ma4vVaa	It's easier than most guys think. Just be kind. And remember that chivalry wouldn't be dead if guys knew how good it made women feel.<br>  Try doing these things:<br>  When walking down a sidewalk with her, walk on the street side.<br>  Open doors and allow her to walk in first.<br>  Say your proud of her when you are.<br>  Don't be mean or jealous of her success.. Don't cheat.<br>  Give honest, geniune comments.<br>  Be a little protective of her, make her feel like she is really important to you.

bpvzeYnCaa	I think it would be really pretty. However, keep in mind that we have all witnessed other people's wedding photo's from years past. If I were you, I'd ask myself is this something you truly want & how will you feel in 5, 10, & 25 years about your pictures. Weddings are a great way to express yourself but you could totally do muted colors in the dresses/tuxes & accent with all the colors you love. In the end, nothing else matters but what makes you happy. You are the bride & you deserve to have whatever you want. :) Congrats & best of luck!|`|O7slexsAaa	I think you have a great idea there. However, I would refrain from having each bridesmaid wear one of those colors. That's a little harsh on the eyes. Maybe you could choose one of those colors, and have it be a lighter tone. I would suggest a paler green (but not a pastel shade, because that wouldn't match with your bright colors). Good luck and congratulations!|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	seriously?  come on!  are you getting married on Easter sunday?  even so those colors are not good together.  pick 1 main/dark color, 1 accent color, and 1 muted color like silver or ivory.  orange is a trendy color right now so you could do that with an accent color like chocolate brown, and then champagne or ivory as a 3rd.|`|AA11650149	I love the idea!  When I hear those colors, I think about Spring and fruits.  You can do beautiful floral arrangements with those colors and the fruits would be a nice touch!  I would not include the robin egg blue/aqua color though.  It throws off the balance of the other 3 colors that go so well together.  Best of Luck to you!|`|vyL7yEleaa	if it is for a spring wedding and done right it could be.. but other wise that would be a very very very bright wedding and if you are in a white dress you could be very easily over powered by all the colors and drowned out.|`|Yb8rJoPJaa	I've been thinking of this same thing but I've been too afraid to put it in motion. I believe if it was done correctly it could be beautiful. I've been thinking of using gerber daisies and having each bridesmaid wear a different color.|`|eL268hETaa	Yes it does.  You could have one bridesmaid dress in each colour, and have bouquets containing all of them.  Sounds like a perfect retro 60's Spring colour scheme.

Love of a 9th grader is way different than love of a 23 year old. Naturally, our minds mature and grow as we get older and we have more things on our mind and understand relationships and people much more.<br>  <br>  However, it does sound like you are falling in love. If this continues, you won't have to ask Yahoo! Answers this question, you'll just know it.<br>  <br>  <br>  From my experience, I didn't think about anything but spending time and romantically kissing with my first love. There were no sexual desires until further into the relationship. So, it seems like you're on that track too, which is exactly where you want to be.<br>  <br>  Good luck, it's a great thing!|`|dbe3949bbbedd96e00cdf1a2462e0484aa	sounds like it to me <br>  <br>  or it could be just infatuation<br>  the only way to find out is ask your heart.|`|K8wDgNwbaa	most liklely. be carefull though i was like that before then my ex gf cheated on me and ripped my heart from my *** and smooshed it between her toes. alway expect the unexpected|`|SRzL2Wexaa	Definitely.

VN3WlVL0aa	Your mother wants you to get a good education and find a well-paying job so that you will be well-off when you become a full adult and are living on your own. Especially since we are in a recession, education is important.<br>  <br>  You can go out and meet new people, even without a car. What about school? There are lots of girls at school you can socialize with. You are 18, so you are an adult, and you should be able to have a relationship now without your family breathing down your neck. <br>  <br>  I don't fully understand the second part of your question. Your mother doesn't trust your driving, but she complains that you don't drive? That's rather hypocritical (if that's what you meant in your question) and I think that maybe you should talk to her about it.<br>  <br>  ?Doomwyte?
sVdQSMvJaa	I would not marry someone with poor credit due to financial irresponsibility!  Plain and simple.|`|tbJraueLaa	forgive me, but how can you want to discuss such a horrible topic in today's economy?  you are cold..<br>  people are homeless, kids living in cars, dad lost his job, middle class now on food stamps..<br>  you are cold very cold.|`|iPNOVR6Gaa	To an earlier question about marrying someone with horrible credit, I said no, don't marry the person.  Just wanted to pop in to reinforce the fact that I agree with your point here.|`|LxvA4vGpaa	I said I would only marry someone with bad credit if they A) paid off all debts prior to saying "I do", B) Showed me that they had changed their ways of handling finances and showed me that they are responsible with them.  <br>  <br>  If they have all debts paid off, and are truly working to change their credit and money handling ways...then we can continue.  <br>  <br>  Everyone makes mistakes in their life.  Everyone has stupid moments...or stupid years.  I understand that there are circumstances that can affect your ability to pay bills (lay-off, hurt/injured, family tragedy, etc) and that there are occasions where your own stupidity was your downfall.  As long as they are making changes and are responsible now, then we can move forward.  If they did happen to get their bad credit from their own stupidity when they were young (18-22) and they have learned from their mistakes, then there shouldn't be too much of an issue.  People change a lot from the time they are an irresponsible 18 yr old to the time they are 26 or 27.  Now if it was a 28 or 30 yr old with bad credit due to recent bad decisions/purchases, then I would definitely take that as a red flag. <br>  <br>  I am married to a man with excellent credit.  I had bad credit (due to job layoff a few years ago and unable to find another job for six months) and there was some personal stupidity mixed in with that as well.  But I had paid off all of my debts ($1500 on credit cards and $10k on car) before getting married.  I now have credit that is on the upper side of good....It isn't near what my husbands is (900 area) but it is in a very good spot. I can get loans without problems on my own now and I have changed my ways.  I have learned and moved on from it.|`|SHARt1k3aa	People get bad credit for several reasons.  They could of lost a six figure job and couldn't find another one.  There are numerous reasons why.  However, would I let the love of my life go for that reason.  NO!  If you have good credit, your credit still stays good.  I was a single parent, my credit wasn't so good due to being a struggling parent and paying what I could on time.  When I got married, my husband had good credit and when we bought are home, they based the loan on his credit, but put me on the title, so that way my good credit could get rebuilt.  I know Suzie Orman will tell you NO WAY don't get married to this guy.  But, my god, every one has a rough patch in life and if you are going to be that shallow to throw someone away because of that.. then you don't deserve him.|`|e7f7b9508f28f00c8e34cd692587ca8caa	I married a woman that has bad credit, did not find it out till after I married her. Now she has me in debt and Has almost cost me my business. So You R right,  good financial management is a must to be happy.|`|krQiDGCHaa	Well, if you read my answer to the last question, I said it depends WHY their credit was bad.  I'll recap.<br>  <br>  There are reasons I would marry someone with poor credit:<br>  <br>  1. It wasn't due to them being irresponsible.  For example, say they had no insurance and were in an accident, and their poor credit was a result of medical bills that they are trying to pay off to the best of their ability.<br>  <br>  2.  They got laid off, and while collecting unemployment (which isn't a full paycheck) and trying to find another job, some bills had to get neglected and they are paying them off to the best of their ability.<br>  <br>  3.  It was because they splurged and were irresponsible and bought more than they could afford -- but it was a long time ago, they'd learned from their mistake, and were paying it off (or it was already paid off.)<br>  <br>  If they had poor credit because they were irresponsible, and they hadn't made moves to change or pay off their debt then yes, I absolutely WOULD NOT marry them.<br>  <br>  To answer your questions: Yes, I'm married.  My spouse and I both have AVERAGE credit.  My score is 685, his is 660.  We are rebuilding to the best of our abilities to get our scores above 750, but it's a slow climb.  My husband had not-great credit.  He was irresponsible when he was 18-20, allowed a car to get reposessed which trashed his credit.  I met him when he was 25 and had completely turned his habits around, and had everything mostly paid off.<br>  <br>  I've NEVER had poor credit, I'm just young so I don't have a long credit history.<br>  <br>  I think sometimes, people need to look at the bigger picture and realize that things aren't ALWAYS black and white.  There are gray areas.<br>  <br>  ADD: If your additional details are towards me, I wasn't saying you were wrong for asking such a question, and I wasn't reprimanding your opinion at all.  Also, if you read my answer carefully, you will see that I was saying if these things happened before we even met -- NOT after we were already married.  I was trying to say I would marry someone if the above criteria fit.|`|lzooHi0Baa	I would say it depends on age.  We all make mistakes, specially when we are young and receive that first plastic card, but we learn and grow from them.  Its what the person is doing about his/her mistakes   or mishandling of finances what counts.   I have been married to both extremes.   My first husband had a perfect credit score, a genius in managing our finances, and debt free.  However, this gave him a sense of power and he started to develope a judgemental attitude towards the less fortunate ones and I became very dissapointed and divorced him.   On the other hand, my second husband was in his 30's, made bad choices with finances, was in debt and had no credit.   This time, this man was working two jobs to pay off his debts, contracted a credit fixing company and eventhough he did not have much left at the end of the month, he always managed to give to a good cause and take me to my favorite restaurant.  It all depends on the heart the person has, not his/her credit score.|`|b8VRlStoaa	Absolutely not a requirement. If the person with bad credit continues behavior to maintain bad credit, it can be a problem. But If you know someones credit and history before you marry them and have accepted this as 1 of the many flaws we all have then there is no need for this to be a deal breaker.|`|MuVKeK8faa	Marrying someone who makes poor financial choices is a horrible idea!  I dated guys and overlooked their bad credit and debt. Guess who ended up getting stuck with all the crap? ME!  So when I married I married someone with good credit and financially responsible LIKE ME.  He's not rich, but he's not drowing in credit card debt with lousy credit score.|`|zIMoBfuvaa	Im married- my husband has good credit but I would have married him even if he had bad credit because my love for him does conquer everything else. If my husband did have bad credit I would do everything I could to help him improve it... Credit Scores can always be raised.

Personal opinion..|`|9CMGO5fhaa	So true, it is a very important thing in a marriage. And I like how you are so realistic because even though you love a person if they have not got something to live life with your never going to be happy all the way!|`|aHWmqYY2aa	marriage is hard enough with added pressure ad moey worries are one of the worst|`|6a3e68591559079347d376d3ad8f42c0aa	I agree with you.......|`|RBRq8406aa	You need to have a wake up call and have a few nasty things thrown at you in regards to life. Let me give you a couple examples of real life something that you have not had the great displeasure of experiencing as can be seen by your inability to understand that some people have bad credit because of things outside there control. Back when I had only been married a couple years I was in the USMC and had 1 small child and another on the way everything looked good and we had plans on staying at least 20 years in the service so though reliable job. Did not have any huge debts just car payment for one car and then regular house hold expenses. Well I got exposed to chemicals and ended up getting a medical discharge with a small check. So here I am unemployed no medical for pregnant wife and at that time the economy was bad not like now but close. Ended up declaring bankruptcy because the job did find paid minimum wage and the hospital and doctors refused to work with me on some way to pay them off. Thats right unlike civilian market if miltiary cuts you lose insurace for preexisting stops. Finding better work was hard once a employer found out I had diasbility they would hire someone else. So in this case my credit was not bad but off the charts bad. <br>  <br>  To hold someone accountable for something that was outside there control is unreal. I lived through that mess and had tried to work with the doctors and hospital but they had no desire. So get off your high horse and try to understand that execeptions exist.|`|b34a54682dc09f70279f26554322d78aaa	Love does not conquer all ... but here's my 2 cents worth anyway.<br>  <br>  My parents have been happily married for 35 yrs, when they got married, both were completely broke and didn't have money nor good credit. My mom got pregnant a month after they got married, had my oldest brother and they were still struggling after after that. But, they were, and still are, both fully committed to each other and they wanted to make things right and work hard to do so.  My dad has never been good with money (he has "expensive taste" and likes to spend money but he's also responsible) but my mom has always been modest, and together they are perfect for each other.  Now, the reason why I am telling you this is because both of my parents work hard to get to where they are right now - they are doing extremely well for themselves now. 5 houses, put me and my brother through college, and everything else in between.  And the one thing I still see when they look at each other is this deep caring love and mutual respect. When I asked them how can you still look at each other like that after 35 yrs? Their answer was " because we've been through it all together" - working towards your problems together and knowing that you will have each other's back will help you grow so much closer to each other.  My mom told me that if everything was always OK then she believed that her relationship with my dad could never be this strong.  My dad told me the same thing, when she looked at my mom, he saw someone who's always been by his side whether he had money or not, whether he was young and stupid or mature and wise.  That's what love is.  They never said it was easy, but if you met this special person that you want to share everything together and if you stay faithful to God and to each other and work very hard to make the best out of every situation then I will say it's shame on you if you give up on hi just because of his bad credit. <br>  Poor or rich, sickness and health they have been through it all - so if you can find this kind of love and you let bad credit gets in a way - then I must feel sorry for you.  <br>  <br>  I am not saying that every story will end like my parents ... but just another perspective!|`|y6AxJskjaa	it doesn't matter if ur spouse has bad credit or not if u luv each other u can get through no matter what|`|kbz5S3waaa	before we got married my husbands credit wasn't necessarily 'bad', but it was over extended and his debt to income ratio was all messed up, so therefore i couldn't get a credit card when i applied, and i got a crappy interest rate on my car. - as for unplanned medical expenses - we're in the military so we have good health insurance. Yes money does become an issue now and then, but it's just another one of those things that we've learned not to fight about.|`|3SSVBJAqaa	My credit is shot and he is marrying me, but he knows my credit is shot from extensive medical issues that would take me an hour to type up on here. I agree that marrying someone who was irresponsible and now has bad credit is a bad idea, but not marrying someone who has bad credit due to extenuating circumstances is sad.|`|SiniSj1eaa	you do know that you CAN FIX BAD CREDIT....if you really loved the man you would help him fix his bad credit.<br>  <br>  also a lot of times people have bad credit because of mistakes they made when they were 18-21 years old...people can mature when it comes to dealing with money so to say that his credit score determines how he would handle money now isn't necessarily true..|`|0d0W0nbVaa	when my wife was divorced from her first marriage,  her credit got shot and she filed bankruptcy.  her credit was horrible.  that has nothing to do with who she is as a person, or how hot her @ss look in jeans, tight mini skirt, daisy duke shorts, thongs, g string and naked. <br>  <br>  i have 800+ credit rating on all 3 reports.  i can finance Sears Tower if i want to.  and i really can care less what my wife's credit looks like.|`|ByUS0k8waa	Sorry but people change and get more responsible. I think the way you handle money when you single isn't the way you will handle it when your married. My husband had worst credit than I did but neither was perfect. I don't see how it matters if you really love the person.|`|m4T0IT0yaa	Personally I think this sounds ridiculously materialistic in some ways.  And yes, I believe if you really love someone, nothing else matters.  I'm not saying they're aren't hurdles to overcome such as finances and sickness and things like that.  That's LIFE.  In this economy when someone looses their job, and their credit goes down the f'ing toilet, it's not "their own doing" like you say.  It's called LIFE.  Sh*tty things happen to good people.  That's why when you say "I love you" to someone and you then you marry them, that's where better or worse comes in.
NpzNHmCGaa	Um ive never had a message from a guy friends girlfriend of that nature. I guess she was just being honest about how she felt (but annoyed with him at the same time so came accross badly towards you). As guess as you are his bestfriend (and female) you are going to be the first person she tells to back off. Mind you the fact you live miles away from this your bestfriend I can't see how you would be causing that many problems. She is probably using you as a scapegoat for problems that we not even caused by you. I would just give them a bit of space but keep in contact with your friend and maybe tell him about the email you got from his girlfriend. Be calm about it with him even if she was out of order she is still his girlfriend.|`|ZzEAc5ecaa	she thinks you want him ... just talk to her as a friend then she could grow up a little bit i hope ...|`|TrEDiWR7aa	she doesnt trust him and she thinks he likes you. sounds like they'll break up soon so it won't be a problem..

Good luck to you!|`|pOCabUMvaa	One thing, never believe a thing they say about divorcing their wives, they will never do that! Never, ever, ever!!!!<br>  <br>  Boy, I do not know of anyone who is having an affair and people know about it, and you are just as happy as clams!! Wierd.<br>  <br>  Oh, you did not say he was divorced in the first paragraph.<br>  <br>  I would not use it as an ultimatum, because he will never, ever, ever, leave his wife, even if she knows about it, he will never leave her, so if you give him a so-called ultimatum, then that will just push him away, and no more affiar. You will push him right back into his wife's arms.<br>  <br>  Cutting off communication cold turkey and finding a man who is not married would be a wonderful idea.<br>  <br>  It never is easy when you end a relationship, but it is easy after that and you start living your own life.<br>  <br>  No tips, just walk away, simple as that, put one foot in front of the other, it might be hard, but the more you keep walking, then the easier it will be, you walking will soon turn from walking into running away from him.<br>  <br>  Your friends are your friends, they care about you and they worry about you, they are being your friends, you will always have your friends, but you will never, ever, ever be his wife.<br>  <br>  Sure, he is happy living 2 lives, why buy the cow when you can get the milk for free??<br>  <br>  Think about it, you are his little sl*t, wh**e, and selfish, I don't give a da*n about his wife, on the side person with no morals and no values.|`|I6vMxEU9aa	If you don't mind being the other woman, then you don't have to do anything just because your friends tell you to. But I think your friends are just trying to look out for your feelings by suggesting that you find out if he is really divorcing. If he's not, the question you need to ask yourself is: Do you want to have this relationship progress any further than it is now? Because if he's not getting a divorce, it's going nowhere.|`|PY160XO7aa	SAY PARTYS OVER|`|81Ru1OL6aa	be like its ova boo boo|`|1UX6rIFmaa	if you have "no" problems he would have no problem being honest with you. He is obviously taking what he wants in his relationships and doesn't care enough about you to listen and participate in what you want out of the relationship. <br>  <br>  You're obviously not happy or you wouldn't be here asking questions. <br>  <br>  If you cannot trust him to be honest with you, there's no chance of a healthy, long term relationship. It doesn't so much matter what he's doing, if you can't trust him and there's no open dialogue to obtain that trust, you must move on.<br>  <br>  Breaking up is never easy. Be up front about your feelings and understand you can't control his response. He will either be a man and accept, or a wuss and try to smooth things over to keep it the way he wants it to be.|`|SHARt1k3aa	Tell  your friends to bud out.  I mean, if you have property and the divorce is messy, it could take up to five years.  As long as you are confident that he isn't in any kind of relationship with her, then you are fine.  I mean, two years isn't that long.  You have to be separated for 6 months before you even file.  So, that takes it down to a year and a half, and that's after you file the legal separation.  It could of taken them 6 months to file the legal separation, so that's a year that has gone by.  It's also expensive to get a divorce and maybe neither of them have the money right now.  Or, maybe your boyfriend doesn't want to pay spousal support and he's holding off for that reason.  Could be numerous reasons.  If you aren't planning a wedding yourself, don't worry about it.|`|cJZL83pLaa	Dating a married man is a no-no because you will leave his wife with a hole in her heart. Imagine being married to someone that you thought loved you, and then suddenly finding out that he had been cheating on you for 2 years?<br>  <br>  I think you should leave the man alone because if he can't even commit to his wife, nor you, what makes you think he'll continuously commit for more than 10 years? He he was truly committed to you, he would have said much MUCH earlier that he was married. You'll only bring trouble into your life by marrying such a difficult man like him.|`|pTBhq0rHaa	Where is his wife? Are there children involved? Well since yall have been dating for 2 years I would think yall have good communication, you need to ask. Just like this:<br>  <br>  I have not heard you bring it up in a while, what's going on with your divorce? <br>  <br>  See what his answer is? And if it is no, then your next question will be<br>  <br>  "Well, where do you see our relationship going? I need to know what your plans are.<br>  <br>  Good luck. If it doesn't work out, maybe next time, think twice about messing with a married man.|`|zFx7NT2Baa	I don't know what the others will say, but as a formerly married man in a similar arrangement, I suggest you need to give him the word -- divorce.  He needs to be shown the door if he does not move on to commitment to the life you want.  The practical getting of things back will be painful, mostly inconvienient.  The woman I had on the string got to the point of a long letter reminding me/us of all we shared over more than two years (5ish) and that helped her let go.  Do it.|`|UTCkWYl1aa	that depends on how much you trust him, if he really likes you he would not lie about that and he would not have a problem showing you proof. he cant be happy being with his wife if he is with you so chances are he will divorce her its never easy making decisions like that, hes stuck trying to choose what to do as much as you are|`|KZfYzhZRaa	when Your at his house just take everything you love out of his house and then the next day just say i need proff and then send him his stuff the time being and if he tries to say anything but the truth then walk away or hang up the phone whatever you have a rigth to be happy your friends are 100% right|`|zY7boFYNaa	Well, I mean that is a bad case right there; it is not right to be with someone whom is married, I believe you should respect with yourself & him, even if he likes it, you should be really conscious on what you are doing. So, you just leave it alone, and tell him .. You know this is not right, this is disrespecting both of us in total... you get me? ---|`|Plu6OVoGaa	He should have divorced his wife by now. I don't think he wants to maybe because of the costs involved or maybe some other reasons. Just ask him point blank "When are you getting a divorce?". But it sounds to me that you're okay dating him without one. <br>  <br>  Don't start something only because your friends are telling you to.|`|5QNwcjfEaa	Nahhhh, just go have a 3-some with his wife and enter into a polygymist relationship.|`|875b9562d8defd3804154e34c3bf5ea4aa	Demand proof that he's married like your friends suggest.

If he can't produce it the next time you're @ his place. Tell him C-ya until he produces it.<br>  <br>  Don't define yourself by a man. There are other men out there. Why stay with him?  If he hasn't filed for divorce, it means you're not important to him. stop listening to his lies and get on with your life.  What makes him so special - you can do better.<br>  <br>  As far as stuff @ each other's house - take what's valuable to you and leave the rest.  For his stuff - give him a final date to pick it up and put it in writing.  If he doesn't pick it up by that date, kick it to the curb. Or if you want to be nice, box it and mail it to him.<br>  <br>  He is not the only man in the city/state/area where you live. Have some self-esteem and get out of the relationship if he has not filed for a divorce.  BTW - divorces don't take that long to settle anymore.|`|ixyNeBhWaa	Divorce sometimes can take a while, both parties need to agree not just the man.  BUT....   If its been two years already and he said he would and he hasn't, he should at least be talking to you about it if he is serious that he loves you.  Otherwise, this relationship is a one-way street.  He likes having two women.  He is a Male.  And you only have been with him for 2 years. Not a very long time.  You should ask yourself... why are they getting a divorce?<br>  What is wrong with that relationship that he needs to see two women and take a long time in filing papers.|`|oauYuhvDaa	You are too caught up in your pathetic, immoral relationship to care about what I have to say...but I'll say it anyway.<br>  You NEVER should have started down this road!  You knew better, but did it anyway, so you have no right to start handing our ultimatums. If he were going to leave his wife, then you should have waited until that happened.  I don't care what he tells you.  You act like since its not a secret relationship, that it is alright.  It's still CHEATING!!!  <br>  Thanks to you agreeing to be in this relationship, there is no chance of working his marriage out.  I know, I know...you believe the marriage was over anyway.  Why?  BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT HE TOLD YOU!  And I'm sure that a man who cheats on his wife wouldn't lie now, would he?<br>  You should have stayed away, but you didn't and now you can just wallow in your self pity and deal with whatever consequences come your way.|`|ZzEAc5ecaa	just ask him if he has filed for it ..if yes then all is ok if on .. then just say do it today or your off .. but give him a chance please .. good luck.|`|OgkGsCkvaa	Well, it is strange that he is married, however, many times it can take a LONG time for a divorce to finalize.  It doesnt seem like your friends are right, I dont see how he COULD be living a double life if the two of you are together as you say you are.  If there was an issue where you werent able to go to his place... then that would be a sign to investigate.
ae3ecab489f9cbbdd2b51fb0492f64d3aa	I know exactly how you feel. The same thing happened to me a long time ago. It hurt so much that I wish I had never met him. But, 2 years later I met a wonderful man and we have been married for 38 years and I can't imagine myself ever being with anyone else for 38 years. We have had a great marriage. I know what you mean about wishing you had never met her but everything we do in life we learn something from it. It is all an experience. Some things are meant to be and some are not. Sometimes people come into our life for a short period of time but they are there to give us what we are needing at the time and then they move on. Others come into our life and stay forever. We don't know why these things happen but try to remember her as an experience in your life and one day you will meet the right woman to share your life with and she will stay forever.|`|8oX0wZAIaa	Yes, that's exactly how I feel! I probably have issues because, on the one hand I love him, but then I realize this "love" is consuming me, so then I hate him for existing.<br>  <br>  It's pretty messed up...I wish I had never met him sometimes, I was doing just fine for once, actually great, before him. Now it's a year later & I can't get hi outta my head. But we talk like 2x a month online....that's about it. And it's better if they leave your life completely. Dude, you really need to move on (so do I, or at least I could tell him & get it over with). Ahhhh! But I feel for you :(<br>  <br>  You're not alone....well, maybe you are...but you're not alone in your predicament.|`|GOaDQuhlaa	I go through that every day. It does not seem to get easier or better. I always wondered why I  could never get past this either. You can always chance meeting someone new. Maybe that would help. I also have to wonder if she might have been the right one. Thats why you are still missing her. I would not wish this sort of empty feeling of loss on anyone. Its a pain that just does not ease up or go away.|`|haR1ZYOhaa	push a button....she pushed a button....push<br>   a different one....over and over :)<br>  you have plenty of time to hit the reset button.|`|OtKCAeQZaa	Life is about making friends and perhaps one day you might be with her, life works in ways we do not expect some times.

She is not a nag.<br>  <br>  Rather than leave, I have found that stopping someone from nagging is an extremely simple, 2 part process:<br>  <br>  1.

I know it drives my husband bonkers... And at the time i feel justified but in the end after its all done i feel like a complete BI***.. Ok think of it this way.. your nagging about what? a messy house? Not enough attention? Not enough help with the kids? DO YOU really think nagging is going to make him want to help more?? NOOOOOOOOOOOOPE... its gonna piss him off and he isnt going to help anyway... I found that instead of nagging and just asking "babe take out the trash".. it works SOOOOOO much better... I know i wouldnt want to lose my husband because i was BI***ING to much =( Some things just arent worth it...|`|krQiDGCHaa	1.  No, I'm not a nag.<br>  <br>  2.  My husband never accuses me of being a nag.<br>  <br>  3.

Nagging sucks!|`|uuMCGT9taa	yes i am <br>  yes he accuses me all the time<br>  <br>  i do believe im justified its mostly about him being lazy & not looking for work. and doing things for others and helping us out.<br>  <br>  he does nag about my driving and being sad all the time|`|LxvA4vGpaa	1.

dFfQxy92aa	First, make sure that you trust him enough to make yourself that vulnerable to him.  This is a huge emotional investment.<br>  <br>  Second, tell him that this is something that you really want to do and ask him if he thinks he can be comfortable with it.<br>  <br>  Third, show him that you are serious - address him as "sir", ask his permission for things, ask about his wants and "how may I please you?" (and needless to say obey him) if he complains about anything ask him if you are going to be spanked / punished - it will seem strange/corny at first but give it a try and see if it grows on you.<br>  <br>  Fourth, lest you be a victim of your own success, establish a code word in advance so you can quickly tell him you need him to stop (he will be expecting you to say "ouch" now and then during a spanking so there can be a very uncomfortable delay in getting him to to realize that you need him to let up unless there is a code word)<br>  <br>  Perhaps try places like www.submissiveloving.com as a starting point and look for inspiration|`|76652fe766b064dedfef1f9a09de248faa	Like they say SEX can complicate everything,<br>  talk to him about it and explore yourselves sexually and comfortably from there, if you both feel that its fine and it will not interfere with your relationship in the future go ahead but if theres one doubt in your mind, do not do it.<br>  <br>  PS<br>  <br>  i like your spunk! lol|`|T61ZN70Baa	O jesus...ARE FOR REAL!!!!

I was single into my 30s and grew to really resent all the stories of "I just knew he was the ONE."<br>  <br>  To be honest, I dated several guys that I thought I could marry and I slapped the ONE label on several of them just for things to fall apart later.<br>  <br>  I'm desperately in love with my husband and have committed to spend the rest of my life with him, but I still don't believe in the ONE.  <br>  <br>  I knew early on that I wanted to spend my life with my husband but he broke up with me, we both dated other people and 7 years later, he finally decided he wanted to marry me too.  Sorry, I know that's unromantic but I feel like I probably could have married any number of people and been happy.  I feel like my husband is God's best for me, but I still don't think I'd call him the ONE.|`|AA11380378	I know this may sound corny, but as soon as I saw him, I knew. <br>  <br>  Good luck, Happy Friday|`|2eoAqicdaa	Straight away... honestly! <br>  The moment we met we were both like yep he/she's the one :)<br>  Still together 2 and a half years later x|`|w1necKzYaa	Actually a month into our relationship he came with me to my dad's wedding and I knew he was the one I even told my cousin's! and he is!|`|di6p10Ifaa	he knew before we even met! lol we have this inside joke because he was a good friend of my big brothers. He said right before he met me he just kept thinking "That would be so weird if I married this girl, my friends little sister." and here we are nearly 2 years later and getting married! I knew he was the one after about 2 months and I really really got to know him and know what an amazing man he is. We got engaged after about a year of dating.|`|AA10784932	We haven't been apart since the night we "met". (we went to high school together, but never really hung out or talked much). I moved in w/ him after a month of dating.  We have been together for almost 3 years, and he knew he wanted to marry me like a few months into our relationship. I knew around the same time. He actually was drinking when he "proposed" so i wasn't sure if he was serious or not, but the next day he took me to pick out my ring! We are getting married Sept 5th! Im excited, and can't wait to spend our life together! I know we were meant for each other, i can't believe I didnt see it in high school!|`|4459a617a0f5dd8c54421a39f39f8ed4aa	For me it was about a month into the relationship. I was attending an all day conference at a hotel that didn't provide coffee and was texting him through my boredom and caffeine withdrawal. He hates coffee and he went out of his way to bring me one. It was adorable.<br>  The next day a family friend passed away and he was there for me the whole day--took me to my favorite fast food, let me cry on his shoulder, watched a silly movie to cheer me up and then he told me he loved me, then we played MarioKart.<br>  My favorite two days ever...so far. :)|`|52e1044b00e7fe6ffc7e96609443787daa	About four months into it. I can remember staying over at his house and watching him sleep (creepy perhaps). I knew he was the one.

We had even bought my ring early on in the relationship, before the year mark and we didn't get engaged about 6 years later because we wanted to be finished with school before getting married.|`|sGP6s7uraa	It was about a month or so for me.  For him? I think about 6 months.|`|2cb46ea6e0285a7d419967ceaef6f993aa	I knew on our first date. It took him a little longer though. We dated over 5 years before he proposed.|`|QVj2JwWKaa	Ive known him since late November of last year....and we met on line, a dating website!<br>  <br>  After talking to tons and tons of crap guys, he emailed me and he just seemed different to me! <br>  <br>  I knew he was the one right away....I saw his picture, I read his profile, I talked to him....He was definetly the one and is the one!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  He says he knew I was the one right away as well...so that is a major plus!!!<br>  <br>  We have been insepreble ever since, whether in person, online, on the phone, on chat or in emails! <br>  We are planning on getting married later on this year!!!! Yay!!!!<br>  <br>  GURL!!! Its not ridiculous, you get that feeling that is different from any other feeling you have gotten from a man, and you know that He is THE ONE!!! <br>  <br>  DOES he have the same feelings???|`|rQlsLZ9Baa	I was so caught up in being single that when I met him I just wasn't ready to settle down. I thought being in a relationship meant that I would have to give up fun, friends and freedom. It took him 6 months to convince me to start dating him, and then probably another 4 months before I really let my guard down and got to know him for who he was. Once I stopped being so selfish I realized I was dating the most amazing man in the world. <br>  <br>  We have friends that wed after a week though. It's different for different people.|`|HcboXOmjaa	I knew about 10 months in.  At this point is when we started seriously talking about our future and doing more things together, like make and eat dinner together and go to family functions together.

It's been almost 2 years now :)|`|2324ca2619e6dee826826d027a6a3effaa	We both knew the moment we saw eachother. As another poster said, people don't believe it, but it's true. We were being introduced at work (he had just started) and when I looked up at him there was this look in his eyes like he could see my soul. He told me after our first date that when he saw me I was glowing. Literally there was light around me. I am not making this up, I swear. He moved in after two weeks and we have been together 4 years and married over one year.|`|Z9WqYNR0aa	Okay well we been going to  school together all our lives.

Like i've heard his name around but didn't really pay much mind to him " Pretty big school in Miami,Fl " In 7th grade I was dating this guy until 9th grade.  (I was pretty heart broken) <br>  <br>  To make a long story short 5 months later we started dating and have been together for 4 years. I knew he was the one about a year after.<br>  ( Remember were pertty young, just turned 20) so it took us longer then most here. :]|`|vCZuh3oDaa	We exchanged "I love you" after two months.  But as far as the first time I know he was "the one": that came about nine months in.<br>  <br>  I clearly remember the moment I knew I wanted to spend the rest of my life with Daniel: We had just left the YMCA in Indianapolis and were walking back to my summer apartment... I forget what we were talking about, but he was holding my hand,  laughing.  That's it. I just knew.|`|S3oiz7vXaa	It was the moment I met him...I fell in love..and I knew whatever it took, that I wanted to spend the rest of my life with him. He told me that it was the first time I told him I loved him...which by the way was the 2nd day we were together! I know...a little fast, but we've been together for 1 1/2 years, and we're getting married soon!|`|p27jMTFuaa	It was about two weeks after we started dating.  I kind of thought that she was probably the one.  I was ready to get engaged about three months into the relationship.  But it took a little bit longer to convince her so we got engaged a year after we started dating :)|`|fvyDx1Zaaa	The very moment I met him I knew we were going to get married. Nobody really believes that, thankfully I had a friend there when I met him, and I told her "I will marry that man one day". <br>  However, it took him 3 years to get the nerve to ask me:-D|`|68MkdEgiaa	I knew he was the one after 2-3 months of dating. He was just made everything in my life better! :) <br>  If you feel that he's the one than no one can tell you otherwise. It's your feeling and we all that when that feeling strikes it's real! :)|`|PoBIyZ27aa	I knew from the moment we met that he was special. I think about 3 months into the relationship, I knew we were going to get married.|`|DeWADdQaaa	i have been with my bf for 6 years and i would say after the second year i knew.|`|rpVQpJA7aa	About 2 mos into our relationship: He told me he was joining the military, and I cried my eyes out because of how much I would miss him (thats when I knew)|`|AIrPtuDUaa	it took me a little while but i finally came to my senses..lol|`|YSnyZeRYaa	I had a sense he was the one with the first kiss. That kiss just knocked me on the floor - it was amazing! What sealed the deal was when I was hit by a minivan while I was in a crosswalk, and he left his job and had a friend bring him across the city to the hospital where I was. At the time, we didn't know if I would walk without assistance again, and it was a new relationship. He carried me up and down stairs, helped me in and out of bed and the bath, brought me food, drinks and my laptop so I could play video games while I was sitting on the couch and he was at work, and then he would come home and cook and clean, brush my hair and help me into bed. And when I asked him if he was getting sick of me, he said he loved me no matter what and he wasn't going to go anywhere. <br>  Now I can walk again and we are engaged!|`|f534a428c6db5b8e865429b94a1c13c9aa	I know this is crazy, but when I met my fiance, I Was dating another guy. It wasn't a good relationship and I kept trying to make it work even though I think I knew it never would. My fiance and I went to the same school and we were both in a study room and started chatting. As soon as I started talking with him I remember thinking in my head "What if he is the one I am supposed to marry." I never thought that in instant I met them about anyone else in my life. I just kept thinking in my head, what if it is him, like some one was telling me he was. Anyway, then I gave him my number (which I should mention I am not all about giving out your number if you are involved but that is another story and the relationship I was in was pretty much over anyway, he relapsed on drugs and I couldn't get him off them and it was just a matter of time) and then he ended up calling me a week later, right after I had broken it off with my ex. 2 yrs after the day we met he proposed. I still to this day never even told him about the thoughts in my head that day, sounds too weird.
n6RASb3jaa	what about switching to 3; 10 hour days instead of just two and going back to analog and keep your internet depending on how expensive it is. and unplug everything after your done with it like tv, pc, table lamps etc.<br>  <br>  and explain to ur dr that you don't get enough sleep and most dr's especially since your preggo will recommend less time at work|`|OyRX3OxLaa	So who do you think am i, your life adviser? jeez, 20 questions in one post....|`|c99a5407fb7bfb892111f9e9314b6dcaaa	get your tubes tied|`|zka26204aa	Yours and the baby's health is extremely important right now.  Is there a parent or other family member that could come over or watch your child for about 6 hours on the days you work?  That would help you a great deal.  If your boss is not agreeable to weekend work, ask if you could cut your hours some or work from home a couple of days.  (You did not say what type of work you do.)<br>  <br>  In the States, I know many people that work from home doing medical transcription.  Check that out.  <br>  <br>  Have you thought about hiring out to watch other children at home during the day, so that you could get some rest at night?
AA10483654	To avoid making the situation any worse than it needs to be, why not follow your instincts and stick with something like, "It hurt my feelings and made me angry when you said [whatever the hell he said]." That way, you're wisely attacking the behavior, and not the person.
ZZbIoprPaa	this has happened to me before<br>  A LOT<br>  maybe my friends are just nicer then me, i dont know. <br>  <br>  i would definately talk to them about it. your friends i mean. if your the only one who is bothered by her (but you probably arent) you can start distancing yourself from her. when she comes be nice, but then excuse yourself to take a walk. you dont ever need to be around her if you dont want to.<br>  <br>  also, especially if you have another friend who also dosent like her, you two just makeup some excuse and leave. why be around her if she gets on your nerves? come back a while later, and she might not be there.<br>  <br>  OR<br>  <br>  you could take command of the conversation. she might not be as annoying if she has to play by your rules. so if you talk about somthing you want, or a conversation your leading... you can kind of control the mood. <br>  <br>  OR (final option)] in my opinion the easiest<br>  the big sister approach<br>  you take her under your wing<br>  with construvtive crisitsm, you teach her tips. especially how NOT TO ANNOY THE HELL OUT OF YOU<br>  and fashion, etc. you do it really nicly, she appreciates you for life. etc. etc. <br>  <br>  best of luck!|`|469c6489c23d9264a9454703f8b8c28baa	You can't do what you want without hurting her feelings. It's not possible.<br>  That doesn't mean you have to tolerate her, though: it just means that you have to accept that you will hurt her, and that there is no way you can avoid it.<br>  <br>  Just tell her you don't want to hang out with her. Do it privately (not around other people) and don't be rude, mean, short-tempered, or snotty about it. She'll be hurt, but she'll be hurt more if you pretend to like her, then snap at her in irritation one day.<br>  <br>  Part of being an adult is dealing with difficult persons, or even persons whose personalities don't click with yours, in a mature, kind, yet firm way.|`|dxhTtPqjaa	Just tell her that the group is full or ask her about activities she likes and then do the opposite of her favs!|`|Cvlf7arlaa	ignore. but i think you are mean.|`|fYh70EUlaa	i used to be like that, but the people i didn't like before became the people in my circle of friends..try making friends with her at least,that person just wants to fit in..but if you really think she's too much, then that's the time to start ignoring her..ask the people in your group what they think of her, 'coz you might be the only one who doesn't like her.goodluck and cheers!;)|`|qPZ5poEHaa	Sometimes there just isn't a nice way to do something.  The best you can do would probably be to tell her that it's not personal, you just don't think she fits in with the group.|`|df089a1d7acdbf674fc91dddc4748277aa	Ask the rest of the group, they may not like you and therefore would welcome this new person, spiteful attacks on people can often go wrong especially if the only reason for your attack is jealousy or envy you can not chose who you are with all the time growing up is learning how to deal with these situations, just ask how would you feel if someone did to you what you are thinking of doing to this other person.|`|S00V7LYQaa	well, what's the reason she gets on your nerves and you get in a bad mood when shes around? you didnt say. please add this so i can better answer your question. because I really dont think there is a way you can keep her from joining your group without being mean. Unless you have a good reason why you dont want here there. Did she do or say something to you that set you off? add details about this i will check back.
0LqslIMLaa	Ignore him for some days if you can, but don't lie, just be busy, if he calls or something just say "I'd really love to talk but I've got a lot of stuff to do."<br>  <br>  After a few days, if he hasn't asked you, become un-busy, talk to him again as usual, if after some more time he doesnt ask you, ask him yourself, otherwise your chances are low. Guys will ask, but if he's intimidated asking him may help, or he's just not that into you.|`|YBX6C8GVaa	he's probably intimidated...wow u must be sexy|`|liGKWP31aa	first off thanks for answering my question...<br>  <br>  honestly i think that hes not that into you, he might just think that your a booty call, i know that sounds harsh but some guys are just assholes and dont care about a girls feelings. but i hope everything works out for the best!|`|p4Ss7TsIaa	he's just not that into you.<br>  <br>  if he wanted to date you/see you face to face, he would ask already. <br>  <br>  perhaps he messages you out of loneliness... or just for the fun of it.<br>  <br>  simply message him and demand to know if he wants to see you again or not.<br>  <br>  good-luck|`|DiqzSfuYaa	He doesn't want anything serious with you but he'll be happy to keep you as an option. Guys like to have options - sorry. It seems like it's totally up to him whether you hook up or not and this is unattractive to a guy. Cool off on him and see what happens.|`|Rbn8ouKxaa	I think he's playing a game with you.  Either that or he's not really sure if he wants to hang out with you but keeps changing his mind back and forth, hence the text messages.  (Kind of an informal way to keep in touch)|`|c7xx0QCdaa	hes probobly scared.|`|C7Po10Imaa	He's single and probably has other women. He texts you when he gets a chance. Try being more of a challenge. I wouldn't tell him to ask you out again. Listen to what he tells you but the "bottom line" is if he wanted to go out with you he would have asked. I suspect you will get a text from him at 3am asking to hangout one night. Move on.|`|gH8OeQbGaa	thanks on answering mine =] <br>  <br>  but anyways.. i think that he might be trying to play it cool or is feeling insecure about approaching you on a serious note. I wouldn't say he isn't into you because i don't think that he would be acting that way. He is probably just waiting for the right time or maybe is just intimidated by you. Who knows, guys are so stupid sometimes.|`|ZJB24VtRaa	He might just be to shy or insecure to ask you out. Maybe you should back off and give him a little time. If that doesn't work out then ask him out yourself. Don't be afraid of taking chances. Life is all about taking chances. If you don't you might regret it down the road.|`|eyxPlJF1aa	i dont think you should ask him out.. he knows u want him to ask u, if he hasnt that means hes not interested. he just flirts to keep his options open. I'd say just wait and see if he asks you; if he doesnt then move on.|`|AfplWFrlaa	hes probably playing hard to get
tZUSVuUvaa	I think it's because of your cheesy molestache. Some mustaches just say "Yeah, I've been naked on camera, what of it?"|`|W0AK2Lumaa	You live in wierd area|`|ARlb3XBaaa	Beause you are a very entertaining person.
DcrI9zmkaa	You admit you blew him off and now you're wondering why he won't talk to you?  You can pull a guy to you or you can push him away, but you can't have it both ways.<br>  <br>  **EDIT**<br>  <br>  Honestly, it doesn't matter how you feel now.  He's moved on and you need to do the same.|`|USn04b4Paa	i think his ego got hurt .if he did get mad then he is not so healthy of a person to date|`|g5hbtv4laa	Maybe, but who cares??  You're not into the dude!!  I know you don't want to come off as a jerk, but I would just let this one slide.  Good luck.|`|JEN7wDrfaa	no i doubt it but you really cant tell maybe he knows your not intrested
EYJditSbaa	Wow with such an age difference I'm going to assume you would never date him haha so I would try to get in contact with his parents and tell them what their creepy son is up to, or just call the cops or something.<br>  <br>  Since he's so young i bet hes flirting with you, and that's how younger boys know how to flirt.<br>  <br>  So just give him the hint youre not interested, and if he persists talk to his parents or the Police.|`|qPZ5poEHaa	He probably is young.  I would guess his friends are daring him to ask you out or something of that sort.  I would just ignore them.  They'll get bored and find some other girl to bother.|`|scGOVg8saa	Oh that explains it, he is 15 or 16.<br>  <br>  Immature at its peak, well yah good idea to threaten him with the police|`|Bx7F9jscaa	He probably has a crush on you. Tell him to go away or you'll call the police.|`|AA10268618	He's a boy, that's how we are. Just ignore him, he'll go away
rgCWPPLmaa	I would talk to her first. Ratting her out when she clearly doesn't want to be caught is cruel. What if her parents are abusive? I would only call the cops if she were a young little girl, or if she's lost/scared/disabled/in need of professional care. It's obviously a case-by-case thing, but I tend to have more compassion and loyalty for living individuals, not pieces of paper stuck to a post.|`|kyDN37UEaa	She's either run away or scared shitless, so I'd be real casual and walk up saying Hi, then tell her she's pretty famous and point out her poster. :]<br>  <br>  If she's a teen she'll know what to do: if she hasn't been picked up by the police yet she doesn't WANT to be caught.|`|AA12173989	maybe you should approach her in a freindly manner,then talk to her at the same time you txt or call a police for assistance.|`|AA10072732	first i will make the call and give them the place and then i will approach the person and talk to her until help arrive.|`|8FbOtXAXaa	I would call the cops first and then stay on her but keep my distance in case she was a runaway. I don't think it would be a good idea to approach her because if she was a runaway she would get scared and run so I would leave it up to the cops.`
JhvqUvlsaa	Well how do you know Remmy will get angry if you haven't talked to him about it? I think that is what you should do is talk to Remmy first and ask his opinion and what he thinks about you going out with Sasha.<br>  <br>  And btw it's not love...more of a crush cuz you hardly know the guy. =)|`|uhZ38xYkaa	Ya, just like Run Wild up there said, it is not really love, but more of a crush.  Besides, Remmy can't tell you what to do.  You always have the final say in your own life.
rZAguFEdaa	All i can tell ya right now is, if it's meant to be it will be. If not you will only find something better. I'm in a similar situation right now actually. I can't act on it though because of other circumstances but this girl I'm really close to just makes me feel comfortable and happy. I'm sorry I cannot offer any advice except that the pain is real and I know how you feel. By the way to anyone who says the phrase, it isnt true. Time can NOT heal all wounds. Best wishes.|`|ReaD6u4paa	its just temporary .ur love for layla will fade|`|fkchpcHJaa	i hope layla's boyfriend kicks ur ***. dude your a moron. find a new girl. u needa get ur *** kicked for real|`|SRzL2Wexaa	Write a song about it.|`|2tBJT53Kaa	Well take this as one of life's lessons.<br>  Take your man pills and keep your feelings a secret.|`|h0ZdSxQiaa	find another girl!!! remember they are both your friends so if you pursue her, you'll lost your bestfriend and friend at the same time... not worth it!!|`|TZ1Z2nhhaa	you should'nt have set them up in the first.|`|bLdOnmBjaa	well...in my opinions its quite complicated. <br>  because first im not a guy, im a girl so all i can kind of answer is what she might feel no matter what kind of choices you make.<br>  <br>  First you have to find out if she really likes your best friend, if she feels really insecure about him then i suggest you should just sort things out with her, maybe tell her the truth but its up to you to or not.<br>  <br>  Now you have to consider her feelings, you will have to think if you will put her in a situation where shes stuck in the middle between her boyfriend and you. <br>  <br>  I apologize if i wasn't much of a help, but hopefully things will sort out between you guys.|`|FS5F3Ryyaa	Do nothing you risk losing your best friend and layla you don't know if she likes you the same way back off and be their for both of them that's true friendship you could be getting confused with her feelings because she trust you and feels comfortable around you because of your friend ship with her boyfriend and you getting them together don't betray them both  you will look like the fool just keep your feelings to yourself for now|`|a5RuNJ47aa	i dont think u are madly in love with her i think you might just want something u cant have so give it some time.... keep in mind that this is your best friends girl and well thats just ****** up if you just steal her from him... bu if you still have those strong feelings for her then you can somehow let her know and see how she wants to proceed with that because even if you are madly in love with her if shes not feeling you then theres nothing you can do to get her...|`|I6VpKZfZaa	If you make a move she may well be very offended in which case you will lose her and more importantly your best friend he trusts you and put yourself in his shoes, how would you feel is he did that to you - you need to forget about her and find someone special yourself, you may well just feel resentment because they are happy and you just want to be in a happy relationship!!|`|j1XrPqNwaa	Hey I know how that feels. Maybe just try and find another girl, because you can't break up that kind of relationship without hurting EVERYBODY.|`|flLzvcXgaa	You never realized at a point before you hooked your best friend up with her that you had a thing for her? Don't press your luck. You may lose everything.|`|Wgg0xLQIaa	consider what is more important.  your friendship, or your romantic interest.  you are very likely to end up with neither if you persue.
suor1jRJaa	It means your having werid dreams!|`|Xhaa1nVNaa	well recently my sister told me that she said her boyfriend had a dream about them getting married and she told my mom bout it my mom said it meant someone was going to die... well 2days later my sis bf bestfriend died in a car accident!! So i really dont know what that mean... we r mexican so u know us mexican are very superstitious!!!|`|S0MOQGJJaa	Ah, girl don't worry about it, it was just a dream and dreams mess with your head big time sometimes... I just look at dreams like vivid thoughts that seem real at the moment... like myabe in your dream you were thinking what if my 2 best friends got married or something... that is funny though|`|KiWJxGYtaa	Maybe it means you either r in love with one or the other, OR maybe they r going to get married someday|`|vWh7fwr3aa	It means either you were just sleeping, or that you are not a good friend at all...|`|Tw79BIbjaa	Nothing - I've had that dream before. They are so not gonna get married lol
vslC8rB0aa	The right time is after your honeymoon. Otherwise, he will always say "I don't ever have to get married. She knows I love her."|`|cwAEsD1Naa	Moving in is a big commitment but if its right you'll know it.  I moved in with my boyfriend and we hadn't been dating for nearly as long as you and your boyfriend.  If you spend extended periods of time together already (i.e. you stay at his place 4 or more days of the week) and you have similar cleanliness habits (you share the cooking/cleaning) and you get along really well (you aren't fighting every week) and have no plans to break up anytime soon then I don't see a reason why not!  If he hasn't directly asked you its probably because he's afraid you'll freak out.. If he's 25 I bet he's ready to move in with a gf, especially after 2 years.  Just do it if you feel comfortable with it.  Signing a lease is a big deal and you don't wanna sign it out of sympathy for his feelings, then you'll end up broken up 3 months in and in a REALLY uncomfortable situation!  Good Luck!!
mojg4PL0aa	Actually, I'm in basically the same situation. Except the girl I love and that loves me lives only 200+ miles away, not the whole country away. I know it might be hard to accept but sometimes you need to just wait it out. You never know what you will be missing out on. Don't give up just because of the distance. I haven't, and I won't. You just have to be patient. It will pay off in the end.<br>  <br>  Answer to 2nd Question: I personally don't do so well with long distance relationships but I have seen them work out. At least long enough for you to get to a middle ground and be with each other. I myself like to have that physical connection with the person as well as the emotional and that's why long distance relationships haven't lasted in the past for me. I haven't really tried recently but I try to avoid them. If you both are okay with a long distance relationship until you guys can move to the next level and move closer to each other then I would say give it a chance. Like someone already said you never know what the future brings. Let the past be the past. Live in the present. Be ready for the future. Take a chance if it's worth it, if it's meant to be it will all work out for you. Best of luck.<br>  <br>  -Zach-|`|rphR4pXKaa	I say wait it out you never know kid trust me!<br>  <br>  Now help me out: <br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AqyyIpH4zdDPWX7G.JIg3Ozsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090309235712AABuMnF">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|2tBJT53Kaa	just see how the summer goes.|`|lTsONvwQaa	wait it out maybe you can go to colleges near each other|`|L3G8r2Msaa	i think you should still keep her as a friend cuz who knows? the future isnt set in stone and theres always a possibility that things could work out.<br>  Best of Luck!|`|rgCWPPLmaa	why would you stop talking to someone you clearly like and want to get to know better?|`|flLzvcXgaa	yea you never know. keep the lines of communication open but dont limit yourself you both are very young and just remember if it is meant to be, believe, it will be.

lNlL0Ag2aa	He probably didn't take it offensively at all if you were looking behind you and stuff cuz that would have shown him that you thought he was waving at someone else. At least, you didn't just stare at him without waving back :D.<br>  <br>  But still, he could have gotten a message that you're not into him, and if you are, then how about you make the first move next time you clash?
XGgPhaDbaa	You guys need to go to a counselor to find out why she is cheating on you. Yes she is cheating without sex. If you can't resolve this, I suggest both of you moving out to separate places and renting the house until one of you can buy the other out or sell it.<br>  Living like you are sounds like hell.|`|33ff7896e21262632a7a84d1edc78dc5aa	"...we even have sex every now and again."  Does that mean you guys aren't really together anymore?  If that's so then isn't she free to have sex with who ever she wants?  You wanted to smell her to prove she wasn't lying?  You are a freak, no wonder she left.  If you guys are just sharing a house it should be fine to sleep with other people, but if that's the case you two really need separate beds because sharing a bed is just confusing the boundaries of the relationship.  If the kid lives there with you two just make a general rule like "no adult sleepovers at the house".|`|52I4DC49aa	Just let her know that you are really bothered by the fact of her seeing someone else .(that is natural) and ask her how can she disrespect you like that in your own home?
5fuMnjjtaa	Victoria, <br>  Although we like to think that guys are complicated, they really are not.  We make excuses for why they are doing certain things, like having a bad relationship previously, but ultimately, that is not going to stop a guy from going after you if he wants you.  The fact that he is telling you that he likes more than one girl at a time should be a sign that he may not be the one for you.  No one wants to feel like they have to fight for the boy that they like.  What you deserve is a guy that when he says he has feelings for you, he goes after you and shows you that you are the only one on his mind. Guys will rather chop off their arm (ok, maybe not drastic) than let down a girl, so he is just dragging it on as long as he possibly can without hurting you.  My advice is to take what he said with a grain of salt because any guy that tells you that he has feelings for you and then talks about other girls is someone who is not worth your time.|`|N4A3pKStaa	He sounds like he doesn't know how to ask you out. <br>  <br>  You are making this too complicated.

You shouldn't have to wait for him to decide - and even though he was trying not to be shallow, it made him sound like a jerk to me - making it clear he had options, what's with that? Maybe he's testing you in the stupid boy way, but I think your best bet to know what the heck is going on is to ask him, preferably when you're alone as to avoid interruptions. Good luck! I hope this helped at least a little bit!|`|cjcFjW8Daa	Well heh.<br>  Usually guys that have been cheated on, tend to become a player, or more unconfident about relationships.<br>  Since he says he has a chance with two girls, he seems like hes going into the player mode.<br>  And another thing thats not good is that your friends want to kick his teeth in,whys that?<br>  And if you really like him, then tell him how you feel.<br>  And see what his response is, then ask someone about that too.
a7VkyZLfaa	I know what you are talking about , last relationship the guy who I was dating were amazing and he said he love me for ever and suddenly he started not to call and ignoring me and I spent 3 months waiting for an explanation , I couldnt believe it and I asked him that if he want to breakup with me he said no I dont want if I want to I will come and talk to you , but he never called and never explained and after 5 months I got the chance to see him accidently and I asked him why you said that you love me he said well there are many differant type of love ..go figure , he was an *** hole and I thank God that He is not with me now.Answering your question yes I want the guy to say that I dont want to be with you any more and say a reason inorder to let me know and learn for the next relationship. I read the book why men love bitches and I found out what was the reason he ignored me and now I am with a wonderful guy and he appreciate everything. read that book I recommend it strongly.|`|4RgXh3ftaa	OMG!

Dumping someone is one of the most unpleasant relationship experiences to have to go through, but I've always made it a point to do it honorably, and to just tell the person it's not working out. I really like the same courtesy shown to me.|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	while I don't waste a great deal of time waiting by the phone, I prefer the decency to say straight out "hey, I don't feel the sparks" or "this isn't working for me".  <br>  <br>  If I don't hear anything in about a week then I'll assume he wasn't interested but if he is able to behave decently I just may think enough of him to fix him up with someone else  (I've married off several friends and a cousin that way.)|`|eAhkr1ruaa	I would definitly prefer him to just tell me straight up.

4cc625c81315e3cc57858f7de7250b2aaa	Are you seeing something in his behavior to make you wonder if he is feeling this way?  If he is a real adult, the way I would know he didn't want the relationship anymore is that he would TELL me.

piZTNP1iaa	Steps<br>  <br>     1. Examine his body language. If he likes you, you may see that he rarely turns his back to you, often leans towards you, and also looks at you a lot.<br>     2. Notice his eye contact. If he likes you, he may either look away quickly if he is shy, or he'll try to catch your eye and hold it or make faces. This can be uncomfortable if you don't like him. If you feel like you have held eye contact just a fraction of a second longer than you would with anyone else, or if he looks away quickly, then there is something there. When he's around you and he says/does something funny and everyone around laughs, his eyes will flicker towards you for a second to see if you laughed, too.<br>  <br>            * His pupils may dilate if he likes you, but this is quite hard to pick up on, and you might come across as acting strangely by looking that closely into his eyes. If you're around him for a long time, it could be easier to pick up on gradually.<br>     3. Listen to what he's saying. If he likes you, and he's nervous, he'll probably start talking about himself. Many times, guys feel the need to prove themselves- especially if you talk about another guy in his company.<br>     4. Be aware of touching. He might put his hand on your arm when he laughs, and won't move his leg if it happens to touch yours, or he may hug you for small things - all are good signs of a guy liking you, unless he's a bit of a "playboy" who flirts with a lot of girls. See if he uses any of the tricks in How to Touch a Girl, and see if he uses them more with you than with anyone else.<br>     5. Watch his actions around other girls and see if he treats you differently. Some guys flirt with other girls to get your attention. It gives them a chance to see your reaction. It helps them know if you really do like them or not. The way you can tell that they are trying to make you jealous is that they find little times when they're flirting with the other girl to look at you. His eyes will flick over and look at you. Another sign is that when you leave, he stops flirting with the other girl. That will be a harder one to pick up on, but you can have a friend look for you or something like that. You have to be sneaky sometimes to find out if a guy likes you.<br>     6. Watch for him showing interest in things you like and do. For example, if you like a certain genre of music that he likes as well, he may suggest bands or artists for you to listen to. Another example, if you play sports he may ask to play against you just to show off that he's good at something you both like and then also have a reason to give you compliments as well.<br>     7. Check for signs of nervousness Nervous laughter, sweaty palms, deep breaths, fidgeting, looking away quickly when you notice if he is watching you are all good signs of an attraction towards you and that he is nervous about making an impression on someone he fancies.<br>     8. Pay attention to his friends. If they know he's interested in you, they might tease him subtly when you're around, hint to you that he likes you, or even try to find out if you like him. Study their reactions to your presence - do they smile? Do they turn to him? Do they smirk in a way that suggests they know something that you don't?<br>  <br>  <br>  Tips<br>  <br>      * If you like him and you are confident, ask him out.<br>      * The Clock Test: To see if a guy has been checking you out, abruptly look at the clock, then look at him really fast. If he followed your eyes to the clock, he was staring at you and was startled by your sudden movement that following your eyes is a reflex to them.<br>      * If he seems comfortable talking to you about other girls, he probably does not like you in that way. Either that, or he is trying to make you jealous, which might mean that he likes you but doesn't reflect too well on his character. Or he could be trying to see if you like him.<br>      * If his ex girlfriend hates you, she might be onto something!<br>  <br>  <br>  Warnings<br>  <br>      * If you look at him a lot, he might look at you just to see if you're looking at him and not because he likes you...<br>      * Remember that if you like someone you can sometimes misread their signals in the hope that they like you back. For instance, a guy who teases you in an affectionate way may act like that towards everybody and doesn't realise that he's making you swoon every time he pokes good-natured fun at you!<br>      * Watch out for the subtle guys. If he asks you something that could potentially be a date but you're not really sure, make sure it's clear before you agree to it. It can be uncomfortable when one of you thinks you're on a date and one of you thinks you're not.<br>      * The wrong kind of guy might say he likes you without meaning it; if this is the case, he probably wants to see how far you would go with him, for any of those activities (whatever they may be) themselves and for bragging rights among his friends.|`|jpLNLkweaa	They might not like talking about their feelings around you. They may turn their line of sight away when you look suddenly. They may make sudden or awkward movements around you, particularly if you touch them unexpectedly. Look for signs of how he may treat you differently to other girls, and also look for signs of nervousness: Holding arms, excessive scratching, sweating, faux smile, playing with hair.

iPNOVR6Gaa	My wife is 43, and I think she's attractive. <br>  <br>  I am disturbed by the sentence, "Sex doesn't happen very often."  You say that like sex is a thing that either happens or doesn't, like whether or not it rains outside, not something you have control over.  But, you do.  If you want more sex, have more sex.  I suspect you have for some reason relinquished being assertive about your needs in your marriage.  Becoming more assertive will make you a lot happier!|`|m4T0IT0yaa	Honey, I am 43 also.

Ask yourself what would make you feel sexy?  Get a makeover if you can.  Buy new clothes, new hair-style.  I like being in my 40's personally, I wear a size 6 jeans, I take care of my skin and hair, etc.  I love being this age because just having the knowledge and comfort in MYSELF makes me feel sexy.  That's good enough for me.<br>  <br>  Edit: I just read you addition.  Why wouldn't you get off too?  Does he make you feel like it's a chore?

AA12022384	You can hardly know a person after six weeks, at the beginning of relationships you are both on your best behaviour. When a relationship is relatively new, many people confuse that initial attraction and pleasure taken in another's company for love<br>  <br>  In my experience the relationships that build up slowly and are based on friendship tend to work out better than rushing into it. <br>  <br>  What is the rush? If this person is trying to push you into an engagement it should be sending off warning bells. You need to ask yourself a very serious question, “Why am I rushing into a relationship with this person?” The answer to that question could save you from getting hurt <br>  <br>  Relationships need to develop slowly. What this means is that if you are meant to be together long-term, then you'll have plenty of time to get to know each other. Both trust and respect are not earned right off the bat, so it only makes sense that the relationship move slowly, too. There is no need to rush. <br>  <br>  Marriage should be a lifetime commitment and rushing into a proposal too soon in a relationship could cause one to question your ability to commit. Not to mention your ability to think clearly.<br>  <br>  While we all like to believe in the “love at first sight” ideal, the truth is that passion fades, while love is forever. If you truly believe in your love for someone, you have no excuse not to give it time to bloom.|`|2b4OFx5Oaa	If you have to ask, then you already know the answer.<br>  <br>  6 weeks in this fast paced world is still too short of a time if you truely want it to work.

You can be engaged as long as you want to but once you are married there's no going back that easy.|`|uuMCGT9taa	i wouldnt have it but thats jsut me <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  id look up divorce rates for that time period of knowing each otherr <br>  <br>  <br>  but you never know !!!! you never know !|`|wfMC742Naa	Normally I would say never, but it is what my husband and I did.

CWgJ7Yyxaa	I agree with the first two answers. <br>  <br>  A divorce is never easy; even when we know it's for the best.<br>  <br>   To me, it means you have to accept the death of a dream you once had...and that is sad and hard to deal with. It is a kind of mourning we all go through. Our minds usually make us remember the good parts, instead of the bad ones, and that makes it harder for some people.<br>  <br>  I also recommend going to therapy...I was separated for a year before I asked for mine, and therapy helped me to vent and to move on.|`|48e54c6394da5ea92d90b07084568dcfaa	Im married for 20 years now, and sometimes takes more energy, effort and time to make it work. But the idea of divorce is not suitable for me, but for sure Im not having the same problems than those that finally ended up divorced. Just thinking sad of my children without their dad, makes worth it every effort. Maybe the difference is that he`s a great man, not the passionate lover in his 20s or the 24 hrs energizing boyfriend..but a committed great man in his early 50s.,and I accept that even thou I came from venus and he from mars...|`|FhKfyxWlaa	Because it is a huge loss. Just because you wanted it and initiated it, doesn't mean that you don't still suffer grief from it. It's a major life change.|`|XlhBBZPxaa	it is normal and ok to be sad even when you wanted the divorce I was sad after I wanted mine but it works out in the end|`|5lPIKcOaaa	Why would you want a divorce? <br>  Do you feel trapped? <br>  Are you upset with your life? <br>  Has it disappointed you? <br>  <br>  Whatever the reason, you should not give up so easily, ****, after all, you have two children in the mix here! (if there was abuse, it is different all together) but if he was a loving, caring father and husband than why are you depriving your children of this, why are you taking them away from their home and father?? <br>  I think you should have thought harder about this! If you think husband has turned into someone you thought he wasn't, remember, he probably hasn't changed that much. Your expectations just probably have! <br>  Think about who your hurting! <br>  You should feel sad, you should feel hurt, your tearing your family apart... for what? So you can be a single mother and raise your children virtually by yourself. Good luck! Not to mention the resentment and anger your children will feel not having their father around anymore. Any issues you have as a couple should be resolved, and talking about, staying together is not impossible!<br>  <br>  remember if there is physical abuse or mental it is not a healthy environment and children should not grow up in that.|`|Gp5KEbPqaa	I am in the same boat.  I want to get out of our marriage, but I just can't say the words because I don't want to see him hurt, I do still care about him and his feelings, just not like a wife should.  I think it is normal to feel this way.  Stick to your guns, there is a reason that you wanted the divorce, remember that and try to heal and move on.|`|SHARt1k3aa	whether you wanted the divorce or not, it's the end of your family.  That is a sad thought.  The thought of being a single parent.  It's absolutely normal  for you to be sad.  The house feels different.

She now "dangles their child over his head" and plays silly jealous games.<br>  <br>  For his sake, please don't do that to him.|`|6a3e68591559079347d376d3ad8f42c0aa	I think that you should not be sad if he is not doing his part or maybe you just don't want 2 see him hurt or hurt his feelings.|`|AqU180claa	read: men are from mars and women are from venus by:john gray PH.D|`|AA10500537	maybe down deep you really dont want it ,<br>  you should really think it over .|`|Ikd9cppcaa	You are sad because it is what you want but you are afraid of heading into the future alone with two kids.|`|m4T0IT0yaa	It doesn't matter who wants the divorce, honey.  It's a difficult and emotional thing to go thru. I wanted my divorce too but it took a long time to recover from it.  It's going to take him.  Just be kind to yourself.  Therapy helps the healing as well too.  I'm divorced 6 years now and with someone else, but it still doesn't sit well with me.  I doubt it ever really will.
0d0W0nbVaa	your husband saw the world through your eyes... felt the universe through your heart, and what he saw and felt were out of this world and facinating...  and of course he fell for you and married you.<br>  YOU have the capacity to feel and see things in different dimension than the rest of the world.  yes, having to deal with the downside of bipolar sucks..  and selfworthlessness is one of the things you deal with when things are bit down.  (spring time is common time for that).<br>  <br>  i think you need to study bit more on what you have, and have a better plans of fighting the symptoms of bipolar disorder.|`|CWgJ7Yyxaa	Listen, you are not crazy.<br>  What happens is that science has discovered that some peoples' brains don't produce chemicals needed for it to act as it should.<br>  Before this was discovered, bipolar people were seen a weird or crazy people, and they were treated badly. Not anymore.<br>  <br>  Being bipolar is not something you choose; you are born that way.<br>  <br>   Accepting this condition... and learning about it ....is the only healthy way to live with it. You need to be monitored by your doctor and you also need to take whatever meds he/she gives you. Therapy is also another thing that will help you and your husband to cope with this reality.<br>  <br>  We all feel unworthy of love at one point or another...but feeling like this all the time is not healthy, and it will drive your husband away, so be careful.<br>  <br>   You need to seek inner healing and peace within yourself, so you can transmit that to him.<br>  <br>   If you don't love and accept yourself, how can you expect others to love or respect you?<br>  .........................................<br>  Count your blessings and do whatever it takes to live a happy and full life. Do not focus on being bipolar....Seek help instead. ( I have to deal with clinical depressions and serious back pain; so I know what I'm talking about here.)<br>  <br>   Look for professional help..... and see the problems other people have. That will make you feel grateful for what you have now.|`|UFOdwXgfaa	My uncle is bipolar. You need to go see a doctor. You're not crazy , it's chemical unbalance. This is serious, you need medication|`|scnW0Wzeaa	Hope you are getting consoling.|`|rGStRem1aa	are you getting meds?|`|5N0SEfNVaa	I know exactly what you are saying.  My identical twin sister has bipolar.  It is a severe kind.  She has an awesome doctor and he has really helped regualate her on meds.  She is doing really good.<br>  <br>  We are 26, I am getting engaged and she hasn't dated at all because of what you are describing.  YOUR HUSBAND accepts you for who you are!  You have to understand that.  <br>  <br>  I think that you know the bipolar is not who you really are and sometimes you really seriously cannot control your actions.  This is when the whole "unconditonal love" comes nto play.<br>  <br>  Please don't be hard on yourself.  My sister sees a conselor and they are really good tools.  I see one too.  People think thats for unhealthy people but we are smarter for doing it.  Because we care about ourselves and how our family sees us.<br>  <br>  My sister is afraid she will never meet someone that accepts her.  Its very sad.  She developed this in her teenage years and my impression is that she didn't develope the same way to relate to guys as I did.  I think this is common with bipolar people.  Its like they are built differently about thinking.  <br>  <br>  REMEMBER SOME OF THE BRIGHTEST PEOPLE ARE BIPOLAR.<br>  <br>  Your husband wants you to be happy so give him that.

Mainly because we talked about it before we got married and decided we don't believe in divorce so that isn't a option unless one of us cheats. That is something you just cant get over at least not totally over. I think that and the fact we love each other so much is how we have got though everything. Plus if you think about doing something you should think first about how your actions hurt not only you but your spouse as well.|`|EdLC4CTzaa	We are going to be married 8 years this April.  How do we get over hurdles.  You just do.  You realize that the long term benefits of working out your problems are greater than the short term of saying forget it.  Sometimes you just have to walk away and take a breather. You know when to speak and when not to.  Once you say something you cant take it back.  There are times when you have to do a lot of praying and when you think it isnt working you pray harder.  Nothing in life is easy and God knows marriage is one of those things that is not easy. You just have to learn to roll with the punches, pick your battles and realize when you are facing a mountain or a mole hill.|`|y1Fihj3Maa	31 years, 27 married.  I believe that on the road of marriage, we encounter many bumps, some big, some small.  I think that you have to decide for yourself if you are able to get over the bumps together.

And I'm not saying you're '' loose '' but falling in and out of love for so many times, people can get to feel lot less about the new excitement of love, like for me, I've never taste that '' REAL '' before,<br>  so every time whenever I try to look for someone, I'm very sure it'll be <br>  interesting, and a big chunk of it must be the responsibility.<br>  So, there I go, never try to settle anything less beyond my wildest dreams.<br>  No second to best, always must be best to nought.|`|kHRD7uUAaa	what exactly do you want?  you need to know that first then what do you have to offer?  decide that then figure out what guy would be interested in what you have to offer.|`|AA10415277	The moment you stop looking for the right one, is the moment when you are yourself, then they'll appear before you.|`|FzFSzilmaa	perhaps you need to concentrate on something more important in your life... and not worry about guys...|`|fglMx3UDaa	my dear a girl has only one thing the most precious to offer to his husband n that is her verginity.but u girls use that for making friends. now u expect that those guys be serious with u . why? if they had been serious abt life they wont come to u. actully they all were a good hunters who hunted u with ur willingness.now situation is complex.but there is still a way. wear a ring of topaz stone of good size 5 ratti. go to lord shiva temple and offer him pure water mixed with ganga jal<br>  <br>  any doubt or querry mail me at madhurmohanshukla@yahoo.co.in|`|r9M63O7Xaa	im married and im wondering the same thing why are guys so much drama even my husband isnt perfect its like do us girls have too many expectations of are guys just stupid for not seeing a womans worth

"I'm the friendly stalker" She is sure to know who you are then.|`|ZCmbMcV9aa	OMG, im in the exact same situation..except im interested in this guy... ^^<br>  LOL<br>  but i dont know what to do, or how to get to know him..<br>  <br>  I'd suggest to you, to just go up to her and start a convo. (i'd never be able to do that, im WAY to shy)<br>  <br>  <br>  But still, good luck =)<br>  You never know till you try.. =]<br>  <br>  ,Katy.<br>  =)|`|hw84xPRPaa	Just talk to her.<br>  Just be yourself.<br>  Be confident.<br>  Think that your the most amazing guy in that school, nd just come up to her nd talk to her, it will help you, just be really confident, nd don't care about anything else :)|`|A1rfDaANaa	when you see her in skewl juss say hey to her and tell her i was the guy who added you on facebook and i sent u a request cuz i thought u were cute and i wanted to get to no yu and be friends (corny but trust me it worksz)|`|htn7MQJ7aa	try to find her when she is alone in school.<br>  Smile and say hello.<br>  Then introduce urself to her.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|x9uW1L8jaa	reply to the comment, 'no you don't, but i've seen you around school. :) what classes do you have?" then get talking a bit more, she'll tell you what classes she has and if she asks you, tell her and then start talking about how you always thought a class of hers would be good and if she liked it. etc etc. just small talk. <br>  <br>  Then if you see her around school just smile at her or say hi. Then wait for her to say hi to you another time, see if she does. Then it should just go from there. <br>  <br>  Then maybe after a few times, stop to talk be like, hi, how are you? what class have you got now?/I love your ____ (could be hair/make up/anything at all) <br>  <br>  just make conversation. :) <br>  <br>  hope this helps.|`|BdDJ2Vp4aa	I think you should show her that you are friendly and say hello.Be careful, one imoprtant thing to know if she is also interested in you and wants to be your friend is that when you make a friendly step forward ,she should to something to show the same feeling too.<br>  <br>  Another solution, is to tak to her and tell her what you want and feel.<br>  That is the shorter way and as a girl this is what I prefer.<br>  In my eyes, the boy wont loose anything if he does that.On the contrary, he would look brave , confident and brave.I would like him better that way.|`|6QsN70D2aa	Well for starters, if you see her around school, you should always wave a friendly hello, or start small talk with her if you ever get the chance to stand together for a minute. "How's your day going, How's classes, etc).   <br>  <br>  Just be friends with her.  I would at first get the whole "dating her" mindframe out of your head, and just be friendly at first until she lets you know how she's feeling.|`|pRDdtpVIaa	It's easy man. Do this cuz it always works<br>  <br>  You: "heeeeey wassssup :]" <br>  Her: "Hello, do i know you?"<br>  You: Not really but at least I found someone in my school and beautiful too.....and yes I am honest like that"<br>  Her: .......<br>  <br>  Wait for her next reply and that should give you a hint. But most of them girls love sweet talk. Her respond will be<br>  <br>  Her: awwh thank you...that's sweet of you...whats your name?<br>  <br>  Then I bet you she will be checking all your photos. If she doesn't ask you anything but rather <br>  <br>  Her: Thanks<br>  <br>  *_* then you better move on *_* cuz she is boring.|`|xZigibGYaa	your next move could very well put you in the creep zone...i think you should definitely try talking to her in person...think hard...do you know any of the same people? teachers? anything that you share besides attending the same school...that's just to break the ice....then tell her she's the hottest chick you've ever seen.  if that doesn't work, become the creep she thinks you are.|`|AA11671841	just start talking to her. thats how  my bf met me :) and we've been together for 2years now :)|`|AA11231327	How freaking cute lol. Wellll if you don't know eachother..of course she's gonna ask "hey, do I know you??" ...ya know? lol...BUT if you're interested in her..strike up conversation with her on Facebook..and then if you get the vibe that she's interested..then casually ask if she'd ever wanna meet up at school to officially "meet"<br>  <br>  [she'll feel safest at school, where her friends are, and she won't be pressured]<br>  <br>  Or you could even talk to her online, and once you've been talking for a while...on night say something like:<br>  <br>  "well it's been nice talking to you tonight, but I'm out for the night..if you ever wanna talk or text, here's my number..."<br>  <br>  if she gives you her number back..you're good to go!! :)<br>  <br>  text her randomly from there, and hopefully she'll do the same :)<br>  <br>  Good luck!!
pVnUhYLQaa	He's playing the game. He's showing you who's in control. "no no no, I don't come to you, YOU come to me". Then when you do, he thinks, "that's right, I got you". Upper hand.
e7yFahGraa	I think about my exes occasionally, but not everyday. It's normal for that to happen I think. Especially when you hear a song or see a symbol that was special to your relationship.|`|jFaYOR4aaa	Not everyday, but at least once a week.|`|1Ayb4UK7aa	The only time I think about my ex is when somebody does something extremely stupid,then we say they pulled a d**khead move.  That is how I remember him.
sPzZ1vOfaa	After school.<br>  <br>  Or maybey stay at one of your friends house then go see you boyfriend.|`|376Tj61Naa	tell them ur going somewhere with a friend but go with ur bf|`|GucrpVR5aa	You guys can meet up at a local library and do homework or something together.. Or watch a movie with your friends and let him tag along.. just say your going to hang out with your friends..|`|VbugLqf2aa	i know how you feel.<br>  my parents are vry strict when it comes to me & mii boyys.<br>  you guys could make plans at a mall or movie theatre, or a place to meet&you can have yur mom drop you off and just say yur hanging wiff friends.|`|B9F4hmjlaa	tell your parents the truth,<br>  they'll still love you no matter what.<br>  and if you do then your bf can come <br>  visit you and meet your parents, and then he'll be<br>  more liked in the house.|`|rJOuo24saa	after skool|`|cfSV6Snwaa	your options:<br>  <br>  1. wait till ur 18 & legal<br>  2. tell ur parents he's gay (this way he can spend time in ur room ;)<br>  3. volunteer at an afterschool program & tell ur parents that ur going there<br>  4. go out with ur girlfriends that have a boyfriend so u can double date but just tell ur parents ur going out with ur girlfriend<br>  <br>  voila!
ZqFzJ2L8aa	As you can see, no white girl wants to asnwer your question. That's because they watch stupid MTV and are superficial about race.<br>  <br>  These girls like Asian men:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3Mhh6XBPfc&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3Mhh6XBP...</a>
9h9JufgWaa	you know the reason why god put our eyes on our face fronting?<br>  its because he always wants us to see future not the past..<br>  i believe he want to change, help him if you love him that much..|`|V7W2T7lGaa	First of all you have to quit bring up the past so that you can move on. I get that he lied to you but everyone lies, don't get me wrong I'm not saying that's ok. But he probaly told you that he didn't smoke or quit smoking because he liked you and diddnt want to quit. You have a reason not to trust him I get that but don't let something stupid like some dumb little lie come between you and ruin a realtionship. Give him a chance to prove that he is not going to lie to you anymore. He feels bad so forgive him. But by doing that you can't bring that up anymore and use it against him at later fight or arguement.|`|2AJmAD0Xaa	Trust is the most important quality needed in a relationship. If you can not develop trust you will lose him as your friend so if you can not tell him to go, be prepared for him to tell you it is over.|`|8FbOtXAXaa	I think that your boyfriend did a good thing by telling you the truth as to what he did and it shows that he can't keep things from you because it bothers him. Try not to bring up things he did in the past because he can't change what he did and it might hurt his feelings because I'm sure he already feels bad about it. Try to have a little faith in him. It sounds like he is trying to be better.|`|nXAvk8B8aa	im going to tell you from experince. i didnt let what my boyfriend did go and i almost pushed him into the arms of another woman,and thats when i realized what he did was done and i cant change that all i can do is put in the effort because god knows he tries,and it hurts him when  i would pull away and throw it in his face and just think what if it was you how would you feel?and even now when he thinks im talkin about it he gets angry because holding it will only tear you down and your relationship.so give him a chance just dont give all of your trust take time but dont push him away you'll regret it i promise you.|`|6oMpHXSiaa	What is it with women holding grudges and don't know how to let it go. My lady is giving me the same problem holding things back and making this relationship out to be a miserable one. You know not forgiving is only kicking yourself in the but and pushing your partner away. People make mistakes and though your partner confessing to you  shows that he don't want to lose your respect. But instead your holding it against him. I'll tell you, relationships don't last when a partner becomes deranged and has a clogged up mind. Take up to much space makes a partner want to bail out. Feel me? if you don't learn the hard way.|`|i7QJAgquaa	if your scared of him why are you with him...duh<br>  if your scared you shouldn't trust him <br>  leave him or your family will find you in a ditch dead some day|`|RK42Z5Iiaa	yalls relationship aint going to last

No one wants to hurt you. They just want to talk to you. If you don't want to talk, just reply and be brief. If you want to have a conversation, elaborate and ask what their views are. Just don't freak. That's all.|`|CY5ADI0baa	i think that you should face your fear and talk to more people.<br>  or you can share this problem with your close friends and parents, im sure that they will help you. :)|`|BdDJ2Vp4aa	The solution is to find new people and talk to them.<br>  when you face your fear ,it will become normal to talk to new people.|`|jLnhnDjhaa	i was scared too.. just get over it and do it.. what is the worse that can happen|`|2mktXMO6aa	Get help.<br>  sounds like you have social anxiety.
tXZTi73kaa	heehee... I remember having this problem once.  She should understand that it's a natural thing and it shouldn't bother her, but as for the pool, here's what you can do:  <br>  <br>  Plan A is to not get too affectionate while in the pool... besides, you're on a school fieldtrip anyway.  I know you probably don't like this plan.<br>  <br>  Plan B is to just "swim it off" before you get out to avoid an embarassing situation with your classmates.<br>  <br>  Your fallback plan... when it's time to get out, have your girlfriend get your towel, then have her waiting poolside so that as soon as you get out of the water, you can cover it up with the towel.  I've had to do that once or twice before...
YlFZFYA8aa	this will go away after a while. just wait. the more u react upon it, the more shes going to annoy you!! just act like nothings wrong...wait did you cheat on her?? if you didnt your good...just be patient and DONT react!!|`|AA10072732	what she si doing is exactly to get your attention. all you have to do is to ignore her and don't show her any reactions. she's hurt and angry, so try also to understand.|`|AA12173989	talk to her in a nice way,tell her frankly that you dont love her anymore,if it will not work then to to the police.|`|PUiPeJqVaa	she might be suffering from an overdose of "damo".. hehe<br>  just ignore her..
F32uPjAraa	I agree. How hard is it to not answer a question.|`|eMUSTCQfaa	I promise to try my hardest to stop these offenders.|`|q76xm0YRaa	It is true there are a lot of trolls on here. Not only do they answer inappropriately, but they also report questions they don't like and have them deleted. I've written to Yahoo about it. Hopefully something will be done.|`|pF63IMyVaa	unless the person is being stupid then im going to tell them like it is, but i wont be mean just for the hell of it. theres certain questions i want to ask but dont because of people like that.|`|hMSVmJN5aa	its yahoo..dont be so sensitive bro|`|Leo4z1EFaa	you mean worse|`|Yrtm9Rimaa	"You are supposed to make people feel better not worst "<br>  <br>  we are not "suppose" to do anything, we do not have an obligation towards anyone ,people will say what they want and it is up to yahoo admin to make sure the comments are within regulations.<br>  <br>  I love reading stupid questions by 16 year old girls who want to know how they can make thier nails grow faster , I think thats a silly question so ill have a bit of fun with it and give a silly answer ,it gives me a laugh ,not trying to hurt anyone by doing so ,<br>  <br>  chill out its just a forum there are plenty of real injustice in the world for you to throw your arms up about.|`|d51rpXduaa	Yes sometimes they are jerks and sometimes the people asking the questions deserve it. However, i find that alot of people on here just look at the answers they want to see and if they dont want to see it, then the answerer is just a jerk to them. You lose either way.|`|dUwl7Gn0aa	But people also are just telling people what they want to hear for points. I tell the truth if they like it or not without being mean.|`|M21c8MQ9aa	I agree everytime I answer a question and see cruel remarks on there, I go into to their profile so I can email them and cuss em out it says user does not allow email|`|XqxnGPg3aa	Couldn't have said it better myself.

Plus what can anyone really do about it once they read the answer they receive its still in your head and its going to affect you and where does it say "You are supposed to make people feel better not worst"?|`|NDk1p1O0aa	Not to feed into your tirade but you don't really have a question. At all. This is a forum for questions "and ive noticed some jerks going around and making people feel worst" with their statements.|`|scGOVg8saa	I guess because people can't show off their real identity.|`|T4kc0bQmaa	I completely agree with you.

Then from then on you know.|`|uLHtXibRaa	I would not..if he made the mistake of losing me...its a mistake he would have to live with...|`|eff912f81628da86c4fc5e6b86fb0ceeaa	why would u want to you broke up for a reason. if u didnt then why did u break up|`|pS8HhQkdaa	You should totally do this...ok you'll need a thong, and police suit, and a new haircut.

Yp2bbBXpaa	I think you guys should talk it out a little more and see if she's now willing to change. You threatened to break up with her if she didn't fix her ways and you carried it out in the end. She knows you're serious now like you were before and maybe she's willing to meet you halfway. Mind you, you have to meet her part of the way, too. So, there are probably some things you could change about yourself as well (i.e. compromise on the sex; say one week you have it more than twice and the next you give her a break and do something she wants to do for a change). Communication is what you really need here, so have a heart to heart talk and see if the relationship can't be saved.|`|XGgPhaDbaa	Just leave it for the best. No sense staying with someone you don't get along with just to be with someone.|`|LcdGLcciaa	Uh no.. sorry to say but shes a *****. You deserve so much better!|`|7XMyY4pLaa	You did the right thing.. It looked like use both wanted it to work but use are too different.<br>  If you both want to stay in each others lives use could try to be friends but other then that i don't think you should get back together.|`|HTTKNa4Qaa	well if her mates are guys and from all the other stuff you've done the right thing, it will only get worse, from my point of view its right but if it was me and my gf I wouldn't see it that way.|`|SRzL2Wexaa	Yes, you have.  Poor thing.|`|AA10898603	Unfortunately, you have done the right thing... years later you'll realize it. Now go on.... show here you already move on.... go! Get! Shoo! Get on by f*ckin one of her friends!<br>  <br>  <br>  SERIOUSLY!!!!!<br>  <br>  If not then years later you'll look back on my words thinkin damn maybe I should have listen to what then was strange sounding advice by this stranger named spoony!|`|52I4DC49aa	Just be strong and avoid talking or seeing her and if she really loves you then, she will come running back to you|`|7AU7GCemaa	Yes, you deserve better than that. A stressful relationship is never good.|`|FS5F3Ryyaa	You have to decide whether or not you love her  or are you just missing  having her around if you love her ask her out for coffee and sit and talk  to her tell her that your not happy in the way the relationship was going and you love her but their has to be changes in both of you  for it to work other wise she will get on the offensive and think you are having a shot at her see if you can both come to a compromise|`|URBdbHP1aa	You two need to talk. Make an agreement that as soon as voices raise one or both of you leave as nothing will get resolved. Talk about what your expectations are as a boyfriend and ask her what she wants. Some women like to have space from their other halfs even if theya re out with them. Every couple have their arguments, but if its over silly little things that could be resolved without coming to blows then its way over due a sit down talk. If your both wanting this to work there is always room for compromise, if not then you know your decision was the right one long term. Good luck.

b7yvPsiVaa	Haha no one really knows what chemistry actually is. No one can give you a definite explanation. You either feel it or you dont. Yes it sucks, I know. <br>  I guess if I TRIED describing it, I would say that it has to do with feeling comfortable with each other. Everything feeling perfect, in place. When you can be quiet and things don't feel awkward. When you can ramble on and on and they will listen. When you both feel like your hearts are tingling. On and on and on. It is nothing you see or explain. More like something you BOTH feel.|`|875b9562d8defd3804154e34c3bf5ea4aa	No one is answering because it's too hard to explain.<br>  <br>  Chemistry is the excitement you feel when you are with a person. The butterflies, the speeding heart rate, the daydreaming about them, so on and so forth. If you don't have the excitement "chemistry" for the person it's usually a good indication that there is no attraction to the person. <br>  <br>  Hope that helped|`|1epjqrflaa	To me, chemistry is loving the way the guy Im with smells, the way he moves, the way our bodies move together. I personally think that chemistry is more physical for me. How we connect on a physical level, very sexy question:)|`|lMu2J3pNaa	it kinda is a woman thing...<br>  when u say u have "chemistry" with someone, it basically means that theres a strong emotional connection|`|woOeYFrEaa	Chemistry = sexual attraction/compatibility<br>  <br>  I dated a guy and we got along great, loved spending time together, and I looked at him and thought that he was attractive but from the very first kiss, there were no sparks, no "chemistry".<br>  <br>  He looked good on paper but whatever is there at a chemical level that makes too people real spark off each other sexually was missing. <br>  <br>  And no, you don't have to have sex to know if you have chemistry.  Just holding hands with my husband used to get me worked up long before we ever had sex.|`|AdeD0xMuaa	The Chemistry of Love<br>  There are a lot of chemicals racing around your brain and body when you're in love. Researchers are gradually learning more and more about the roles they play both when we are falling in love and when we're in long-term relationships. Of course, estrogen and testosterone play a role in the sex drive area (see How Sex Works). Without them, we might never venture into the "real love" arena. <br>  <br>  That initial giddiness that comes when we're first falling in love includes a racing heart, flushed skin and sweaty palms. Researchers say this is due to the dopamine, norepinephrine and phenylethylamine we're releasing. Dopamine is thought to be the "pleasure chemical," producing a feeling of bliss. Norepinephrine is similar to adrenaline and produces the racing heart and excitement. According to Helen Fisher, anthropologist and well-known love researcher from Rutgers University, together these two chemicals produce elation, intense energy, sleeplessness, craving, loss of appetite and focused attention. She also says, "The human body releases the cocktail of love rapture only when certain conditions are met and ... men more readily produce it than women, because of their more visual nature." Researchers are using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to watch people's brains when they look at a photograph of their object of affection. According to Helen Fisher, a well-known love researcher and an anthropologist at Rutgers University, what they see in those scans during that "crazed, can't-think-of-anything-but stage of romance" -- the attraction stage -- is the biological drive to focus on one person. The scans showed increased blood flow in areas of the brain with high concentrations of receptors for dopamine -- associated with states of euphoria, craving and addiction. High levels of dopamine are also associated with norepinephrine, which heightens attention, short-term memory, hyperactivity, sleeplessness and goal-oriented behavior. In other words, couples in this stage of love focus intently on the relationship and often on little else. <br>  <br>  Another possible explanation for the intense focus and idealizing view that occurs in the attraction stage comes from researchers at University College London. They discovered that people in love have lower levels of serotonin and also that neural circuits associated with the way we assess others are suppressed. These lower serotonin levels are the same as those found in people with obsessive-compulsive disorders, possibly explaining why those in love "obsess" about their partner.|`|gfHutvEFaa	It can begin with the feeling that the two of you feel completely at ease with each other, and that you two have an uncanny physical attraction toward each other. While this attraction might be due to each others looks, physical looks, in reality it comes down to a mental game. Game is probably the wrong word to use... Let's just say it could be a condition of your mental state. It could come down to something as simple as each having the same pet peeves, each knowing what the other is going to say before they say it and so on. Having the same beliefs, even the same dreams of what the future will hold for you can be the start of the chemistry you're looking for.|`|34b40Vu3aa	I didn't see your question on chemistry, but I did rank it #3 on that other question.  It looks like it is different for everyone on what they believe it is, so it is difficult to give it a true rank.  I interpreted it as compatibility, not the butterfly feelings some people believe it to be.  I don't really know which is the dictionary definition for it, but for me, it is compatibility, which is why I ranked it rather high.  Although, I guess, if I interpreted to be pheromones and your hormones reaction to them, which is probably more accurate than what I stated above, I would rank it last.  I don't want infatuation for a lifetime, I want love.|`|MOMb0Amoaa	no it does make sense....chemistry is when the person you like walks in the door or passes by you, your heart begins to beat faster then normal...<br>  <br>  and no matter how old you both get...even after 20 years of your marriage...you still get butterflies in your stomach when your love passes by you<br>  <br>  that is chemistry<br>  <br>  answer mine please<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AtUOX0o1iEcnKXT3OqX9BPHsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090227123443AAKLTEN">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|yd2SP7d6aa	Pheromones

Which is the most important part of a healthly relationship.<br>  <br>  Second what is with this "off and on" stuff I keep hearing? How can anyone be serious with anyone that is "off and on". Be true to what you want.|`|RRChsxSKaa	remember some of the things that he used to do for you that made you happy... and try to incorporate them into your daily life.  Leave him little notes reminding him how much you love him... or memories of happy moments together. go out and DO things... fun things that make you laugh! that way after a while you start to associate laughter and fun with eachother.  even if the activity turns out wrong... laugh about it. if you guys take turns experimenting with something the other likes... you'll grow stronger together. :D
SFLA1tHvaa	I'd recommend finding other ways that you can exercise together that don't involve the gym. He may actually have bad self esteem and be embarrassed to go to the gym because he is comparing himself to the fit guys. Try bicycle riding, hiking, walks around the neighborhood - anything to get him away from the TV after dinner. Watching TV actually decreases your metabolism. Also, doing things together will help strengthen his bond to you and hopefully help motivate him. Good luck.|`|SS1FFafRaa	how about....tell him he's a disgusting pig, and if he doesn't shape up, you going to screw the mailman.|`|SHARt1k3aa	Girl, you aren't alone.  Me and my sister complain about this daily.  I mean, here we are trying to keep our self up, by going to the gym, getting our hair, nails and feet done, taking good care of our self.  And these dudes have no shame taking off their shirts and prancing around like they are gods gift!  No sham at all.  Big o'l belly's hangin out, hairy, love handles the whole shebang... me and my sister are attractive too (not to be big headed), and we just look at each other and go.. ewwwwww!  Then they wonder why when it's bed time we're like.. ugh ugh, I don't want to.  Like we're suppose to be turned on.  Fella's it goes both ways, you don't want a fat wife and we don't want a fat husband!  That is if you don't like being fat together!  LOL.  It's not terrible.  Tell him he's young and you want him to get in better shape.|`|RqTC18NFaa	Remember that line "for better or worse?"  Certainly encourage him to get in shape (stress for health reasons, not cosmetic).  You could also offer a, uh, "reward" (sexual or otherwise) for each 5 lbs lost or whatever.  Keep trying, and keep encouraging him.  (but NOT nagging-that will make him NOT want to do it.)|`|yd2SP7d6aa	Close your eyes & fantasize while he is ploughing the fields.  Chances are he is busy thinking about Angelina Jolie anyways.|`|aWgdX0pZaa	Well, maybe 5 days a week is too much for him, reduce it to 3 days and yeah reward him at the end when he goes with you.|`|J2lFJTuuaa	Try to motivate him to go to the gym by offering rewards at the end of the tunnel.<br>  <br>  If that doesn't work, next time he tries to get hot and heavy, say no.

Someone who actually deserves him.|`|6nahE51laa	let him know whats going on! tell him he needs to work out, and it can be fun..maybe he doesnt want to go to the gym, so offer to go jogging with him late at night or early in the morning... =)
uWcYXeeTaa	I went on a family vacation (roadtrip) two summers ago.  For part of the trip, we stayed on a ranch in Wyoming.  There was a boy there, my exact age, who was extremely attractive and sweet.  He and I got to talking, just in passing, and we were pretty friendly.  He then asked me if I wanted to go horseback riding with him later that evening.  So, it was quite possibly the most romantic thing EVER. the sun was setting, we were in a gorgeous place, he gave me his favorite horse, and we talked for hours as we rode around the farm.  we could not have been more opposite of eachother-- i'm from a wealthy new england family and I go to boarding school, he's a country boy, born and raised, working on his parent's 2,000 acre farm, unsure if he'll have enough money to pay for college.  Despite our differences, we clicked. I left the next morning, and I realized as we pulled out of the ranch that I never got his name and he never got mine.  I still think about him.|`|YIPIIXHlaa	I'm not over stating this, my boyfriend is one of THE sweetest men. He was raised really well by his dad. <br>  <br>  Over the summer we were going through a rough patch. I was unsure if I wanted to stay with him because we'd been dating for six months, he was my first boyfriend, and I didn't know if I was ready to become to attached to someone at such a young age. So I made some bad choices, let a "friend" take advantage of me and my doubts, and basically cheated. I felt awful. Told him five minutes after I'd made out with the "friend". I didn't ask him to forgive me, but he did. I told him we could break up and I wouldn't blame him, but he told me what I needed at this point was a true friend so he put all of it aside and we talked. <br>  The next day he went to his grandpa's and made a hope chest, painted it, and wrote our names on it and gave it to me that evening. He said he believed our love was strong enough to overcome an asshole from a different country (the friend). I realized when he forgave me that I really had someone truly special that cared for me. Ever since I've tried to do everything to love him as best as I can, with no reservations this time. We've been dating for more than a year, and he is my one life line to sanity :-)  And the hope chest sits at the foot of my bed and we put pictures, movie tickets, notes, everything in it. He says one day we can show our kids.<br>  <br>  Oh, and earlier tonight he went to Wal-Mart and bought me ten cups of whipped key lime pie yogurt because I started my period and didn't feel well.|`|Bfwg0eBJaa	fed me corn flakes<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090309220836AALTQsm">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|lKutsYcWaa	A love letter three pages long.|`|4xyzTXJRaa	my husband, who was my boyfriend at the time, went on a cruise to ensenada,mx for his moms birthday one year but i couldn't go.at the time we were both struggling first year college students so we had never gotten each other jewelry. i love mexican opal i think its beautiful. he never even gave me a clue, he always sounded on the phone like he was having a blast just hanging out with his family.well the boat had a casino inside and he was old enough to play so when he got to ensenada he took the cash he had earned on the boat he got me the most beautiful opal bracelet in these gorgeous pastel colors, it was amazing.it held alot of meaning. well i had it for about a year and the clasp was starting to get faulty. the same day we were going to go get it fixed it fell off my wrist god only knows where and i cried for days. we went through a rough patch after that for about six months at the end of which he said in his words "i love you i want to marry you and i want to try harder". most of our fights were about him not trying to control his temper. he hadn't tried for over six months. he was no longer fun and exiting like he used to be since we first met. we were best friends all through h.s. and he was always my fun awesome friend. well,he went on a cruise when we took a break after the fighting. he came back a week later and surprised me with flowers on my front porch and a note that said look in the white rose. i looked in the rose and there was a platinum band in it with pastel mexican opal on top.in the same pattern the bracelet had had almost a year ago.i called him almost in tears and he didn't say hello he just said " I don't want to try with anyone else, you're my soulmate and my best friend" . :)|`|U5mYBXA2aa	Hmm i'd go back to my first love....

RC8Pxx8eaa	Nothing has happened so what can he say ? He could even say you robbed a bank but how can he prove anything ?<br>  You sound like a sensible girl that is keeping herself for true love, never be ashamed to be a virgin its a rarity today and boys will respect you more for saying no.<br>  Its easy to be a  s l a g but girls that hang on to their virginity are the ones that end up with a decent boyfriend.<br>  Have a word with your current boyfriend and say that you feel you are not ready for a serious relationship and that you respect him but would rather be good friends than lovers as friends are good to have.<br>  He wont say anything if you dont disrespect him, boys have a habit of telling lies and spreading rumours if they have been dumped by a girl as it hurts their "manly pride".<br>  In time you will learn that boys/mens ego's are fragile and us as women have to constantly boost them up for their masculinity.<br>  You did good not having sex so dont let yourself down now and if you handle this right he wont say anything, but please let him down gently after all he never forced himself onto you did he ?<br>  Good luck and with each boy you go out with you learn a little more.|`|dd0d57e5ff24820c6981c10f9097112faa	why would you be scared he would tell anyone?  cuz that's what guys do out of spite?  start a rumor first then if you feel so worried. or have a big relative do the breaking up for you.  <br>  <br>  ??  confusing.|`|JIvqkQrOaa	So you stay with him to keep him quiet? He'll still be able to talk a month or a year from now. So what does he have to say-nothing! So you both fell asleep together. So you had your first kiss with him. You have nothing to be ashamed of. Dump him, but it doesn't have to be a bad thing, just explain that it isn't working for you, and let him down gently but firmly. In other words, be prepared for him to say he wants to keep it going. Once you start, don't back down.|`|F32uPjAraa	EVIL Jello, But that's about the size of it. If nothing has happened then you have nothing to worry about. If he does spread tales, he isn't much of a man. And that is all you have to say. Nothing happened because he couldn't get past your inner thigh without making a mess. If you intimate premature ejaculation, this will be a great blow to his ego.|`|e9dHHGCSaa	Break up with him if you don't like him. It's that simple.|`|nXAvk8B8aa	if you didnt sleep with him what are you afriad of|`|F6p5R8hxaa	What do you mean "what happened to you"?<br>  As in... the fact that you slept together but didn't have sex?<br>  What's to be embarrassed about?<br>  <br>  If he was really a good guy. He'd respect your feelings, try to work things out, or let you go. He'd respect your relationship and what you had/did while you were together should stay private.|`|flLzvcXgaa	well what happened between you too? if nothing did, you shouldn't worry about a thing because trust and believe the truth will always come out.|`|52I4DC49aa	Just tell him that you would rather be close friends than be a couple.
gUWcvxzuaa	He's your ex so what do you care what he does? <br>  <br>  Don't play his mind games. He's obviously trying to get at you for some reason (maybe 'cos you dumped him?) and it's working. Just ignore him.|`|16KUkMP0aa	There's a reason why he's your ex. He's just immature!!|`|9c27503b79201fde467bfe0f1ef26915aa	He's an insecure man to want to do that. You're better than that darling. Just ignore him. The less attention you give, the more he'll realise that you won't put up with his crap and give up. You are worth more than how he's making you feel, and so if paying attention means you feel inferior.. try to stop giving attention! :) You're not inferior. He's doing this because he feels inferior and wants to feel more superior by making YOU feel inferior. So.. don't let him win like that. Know and believe you're better than that.|`|f2f3c84047d75302b508b93b7d4d7d18aa	he is stupid. how can he do that? but he is your ex so its his business.
tGDnXyE6aa	depends, what is your social status?<br>  Like are you friends with everyone? He probably wasn't.<br>  Are you a class clown? Again. He probably wasn't.<br>  Are you a ehm, teachers pet? Probably was.<br>  Is he your friend? Probably wasn't.
AA12309903	i have the same issue! but what's different is i don't think about it because i need it! i think about it because it's forbidden from my tradditions and my religion and also my parents! that a person shuld not have sex until marriage so..! that what kilss me the most! wish i could help u! hope everything turns good with u just try to focus on other things! and always keep in mind! all sex about is love.. having sex just to have sex means nothing.. you can never tell how bad is it to have sex with someone u don't know till u  ahve sex with someone you truly love..|`|G60s9OrJaa	First of all if youre young thats pretty much normal, but also try to keep focused on other things as well. Jobs or a hobby are good to take your mind off things or try donating your time to a worthy cause, there are many out there. And remember that if great sex if what you seek, the best way is to fall in love, the sex will be better than any shallow sex youve ever had, try opening up your heart to someone, that works great. take care.|`|vWh7fwr3aa	You failed to tell us if you are still a virgin, which in my opinion is important in order to give you a coherent answer in this case...<br>  But the important thing here is that thinking about sex is anything but evil or malicious. If you are not driven by this thoughts of yours and lead you to do stupid things, then just keep thinking about it. Another solution would be to look for refuge in the Lord and his holly word...|`|1G0Db60daa	Get a hobby!|`|TnIsuYqYaa	Go to your local whore house and pay your money.That will fix you up.|`|yCUOXInFaa	Sex is a part of life....if you try to block these thoughts you will become sexually repressed and thats not good for the soul.

Their roles in the lives of Groom and Bride are no less remembered and honored as we savor today’s joyous moments.

Rosemary is the herb of remembrance.<br>  I like your idea too.|`|AA12267111	If they meant that much to you then of course you should have them in the wedding (they will be there in spirit).  I think your chair idea is wonderful and maybe you could have a small picture placed on the chair or light a candle in honor of them both.  You could also dedicate the service to them.|`|a3422bad6666b60894e80bace0f14387aa	Spirits don't need chairs. Just mention it in the program instead of creating an element of sadness on an otherwise joyous day. <br>  <br>  And no, I'm not heartless, my own father passed away in 2006. Do I wish he were here to share my wedding with me? Absolutely. Will I save him a seat? Um, no. He's there in spirit, looking down at me and smiling. I'd rather have that memory than an empty chair with a flower any day!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|2M68xiN5aa	Maybe it is because I am in a similar situation with my fiance but you seriously just made me cry with that. That is such an amazing idea!

At a family wedding a few years ago, the bride had a picture of her mother who had passed away at her cake table.  It was a beautiful picture of her mother on her own wedding day.  It was a really lovely touch.|`|6B0CpWWfaa	I think that is a lovely idea, Its the perfect way to honor those that have past on, those that were very close and dear to your heart... Its definitely not tacky at all, Very sentimental... I would say to go for it...|`|lA6lk50Qaa	That is a great idea. In fact I think I might do the same. Good luck and best wishes.|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	empty chairs are kinda creepy if you ask me.  why don't you have a short instrumental song during the ceremony and light a candle for each of them?|`|hkwBR1moaa	We're putting a white Rose on a chair in the first row for my fiance's mom who died 6 years ago.  And then we're having a short rememberence blessing at the beginning of the ceremony to remember her and our grandparents.<br>  So I don't think your idea is a bad one at all.   When you lose someone that close to you, you can't help but want to include them in what should be the most important day of our lives.  <br>  Good Luck on your wedding!|`|AA11380378	A simple rose on the front row of the church would be sufficient, along with a brief mention by your oifficiant would be appropriate.<br>  <br>  Do not go further than that as that would be tacky. Do not do the ttasteless "ghost" dancing, or the dreaded empty seats with food and pictures, or the worse, pictures with candles and sappy memorials. A wedding is a party and not the place or the moment to have funeral displays. I'm sure your departed one would like you to celebrate and be happy.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|JrYYd6A2aa	I think what your suggesting is a super idea. My best friend lost her  daughter in 2003,, and recently when her sister got married, they had a chair for "Haley" with a white rose... and it was mentioned that  her chair was there as she was there is spirit<br>  <br>   Often it helps deal with Loss on your special day<br>  <br>   I wish you nothing but Joy, Luck and happiness|`|eKtEWrcmaa	I think that is a very sweet idea. If it would mean a lot to your families and the two of you then definitely you should do it and not worry if someone else finds it tacky. i've seen people have photos of their loved ones at the wedding who had passed and were important to them. my cousin had old family photos of a number of people at her reception hall and i thought it was a wonderful addition to the wedding.|`|RuKK1LYiaa	thats a really sweet idea, i've seen many couples do this at there wedding as well as having memorial candles for them in the reception area on a table with their pictures.

a3422bad6666b60894e80bace0f14387aa	This might sound bad but... my biggest (and so far only!) problem has been finding shoes. My feet are small and narrow and I have an orthopedic condition that dictates no heels. So I needed size 6, flat, narrow (2A) shoes that matched or complimented my dress. It was an absolute nightmare, I searched for over six months for shoes with no luck! I finally had a local lady import me a pair of shoes and I had insoles made to fit them so they actually fit me. I love the shoes and I am glad I searched but it was absolutely horrible and frustrating! <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|Xzvoz6mcaa	I had an outdoor wedding, and the biggest problem for me was that it would not quit raining!!

It rained 1 week before my wedding, then after that it didn't rain anymore and the yard was dry.  It was a perfect day!|`|ECe1rgsdaa	My fiance and I keep making decisions, and after a couple months he changes his mind! It's driving me crazy!! We decided on the kind of cake last summer, and now he says he wants something else! We decided we wanted to do one thing for our honeymoon, and he changed his mind on that too, the list goes on and on!!! He even tried telling me he wanted to change the color scheme the other day!! We have all this red and white stuff and NOW he wants to change it 6??? Not happening!|`|JbRTKDFmaa	Finding a location to have the ceremony (outdoors). We live in an incredibly expensive area (Boston) so everyone wanted $1000 or more just to have a ceremony (one place wanted $1,600!). We also ran into the problem of places not allowing you to do ceremony only. They wanted you to do the whole shebang with them (for a HUGE price). <br>  <br>  We've found a park just outside the city. It's on top of a hill that has a beautiful city skyline in the distance. It's also far enough from all the commotion of the city to be somewhat quiet and peaceful. It's only $240 to rent it! We're going back in the spring to see what it looks like then (because we saw it in winter when the trees and stuff were dead and snow covered). We're hoping it's going to be nice.|`|hkwBR1moaa	Money has been my biggest issue planning this.  We would have been fine but in December my Transmission went out in my car, the clutch went out in my fiance's car and then a few weeks ago, the battery went out in my fiance's car.  Other than that, my biggest problem was my sister/ MOH.  We're total different personalities and I'm more laid back and she's uptight.  She can't understand that I have to do things as we get the money and not all at once.|`|wMWfCjBpaa	I'm done planning my wedding and wish I wasn't! I truly enjoyed it. I made most of the decisions on my own and went by myself to get things done because I get excited and impatient easily. I have one MOH and 6 bridesmaids and honestly if they wen't with me on all of my appointments I probably would of killed them. Plus, they're family, my cousins, and I would of killed them a lot sooner than a friend. Even so, they were all supportive and know how I am. I guess the only small snag I had was when one of cousins who didn't show up for their dress fitting. She kept going on and on about the bridesmaids dress on the phone while we were there and the following days. I didn't even pick it. The other girls did. And even though they did, I didn't care if they matched, my only concern was the color. My cousin could of went with another dress of her choice. She kept saying, "it's whatever you want. I'll go with whatever you say. The dress is fine." Then I got literally 30 emails the next day for a conversation about suggestions for other dresses. I understand that she wants to not disagree, but at this point, just say you don't like it! It's easier than 30 emails. Even so, I laughed about it. I love her and am excited she's in my wedding. I guess I'll take it as she's being polite but wants something else. Everything else is great!|`|5d9211d38d6935bc0d08850b222ec434aa	Guest list! How do you choose one dear friend over another when it comes down to it?! <br>  <br>  Narrowing down the guest list was long and arduous...but, then, that isn't a bad thing-it just means you love and are loved by a bunch of folks!|`|caa265fc73cd7f24fe83d9a186ac1af9aa	I think family has been the most stressful problem.<br>  My BM's will be my sister and my fiance's two sisters and as soon as I asked them to be BM's they started telling me what they would or wouldn't wear for a BM Dress.<br>  My FMIL twisted a conversation to claiming I forbid her from wearing the dress she wanted - - which never happened.  she asked what color to wear, I discussed with fiance and we asked her to wear whatever she would like and our only preference was to avoid red because we are using alot of red in the wedding party & we wanted our moms to stand out apart from the party and not just blend in.  I had NO CLUE that she had her eye on a red dress.<br>  My Mom is insisting on certain things, too.  Most of it is tradition stuff that doesn't bother me but I have to keep her in check so she doesn't get too pushy.|`|cGbTJobeaa	I had so much fun planning my wedding. I kept waiting to get stressed out but it never happened.<br>  <br>  The biggest problem was probably my sister. If I even thought of doing anything that she did not approve of, I got a long stern lecture from her.  I think she probably went on a 30 minute diatribe because I went to House of Brides to try on dresses. I wasn't going to buy there. I just wanted to figure out which designers I liked and then was going to go somewhere else. Didn't matter. I still got the lecture about how terrible HoB is.  Like I didn't know that already.<br>  <br>  Finally, I realized that she would live longer the less I told her...because then I wouldn't have to kill her.  Once I stopped telling her about my plans, I stopped getting lectured when my plans weren't what she would have wanted me to do. LOL.|`|AA10784932	My  problem has been money and finding a place to get married and have a reception.  I wanted an outdoors wedding but I can't find a nice cheaper one around here. So I think we're going w/ the church in our town that neither of us are members of! I've gotten things here and there and my dress was only $200, so that helped. The dj and food will be expensive. So im stressing a little. My biggest problem though, has been my family doesn't seem very happy for me. None of them have offered to help/pay/said congrats, anything! His family though couldn't wait for us to set a date, so idk! Good luck! Hope its the day of your dreams!|`|PoBIyZ27aa	For me, the biggest problem is holding the date of the wedding. I'm trying to plan the wedding for August 8th, not knowing if he's going to be deployed before then. The worst part is that we won't find out for sure until July! We're just keeping our fingers crossed that if he gets deployed, it's after the wedding!|`|woOeYFrEaa	Our biggest problem was my husband's parents.  They were divorced and remarried and there was tons of drama about including them fully without offending the new spouses and not being sure if the Dad and step-mom would end up coming, etc.  Everything else was relatively smooth sailing.|`|AA11876609	I loved planning my wedding.  I was disappointed when the wedding was over and there was no more planning to do.|`|rpVQpJA7aa	Biggest wedding problem for me: agreeing with my mom on things (because she was paying for the wedding)|`|AA11310817	Money, and keeping it a secret (because we don't have the money to invite everyone, so I don't want to "rub it" in everyone's face- that I'm having a wedding- and then not invite them)<br>  That sucks|`|716a8aa7512b2c7a9c6c48484ce56701aa	Being able to schedule the church and the reception hall for the same day ^_^
AA10519043	I think you answered your own question. You are already planning to bring her to the prom. So, yes, definitely ask her now!<br>  <br>  It would be a good time to talk about things: your parent's rules, how you intend to balance seeing her with obeying your parents, how she feels about things.<br>  <br>  Not dating until you are 25 is unreasonable. (Of course, I suggest holding off till you're 40....) Long before age 25 you'll probably be living independently and free to date. But I understand your parents wishes that you concentrate on school rather than building a relationship at an early age.  If you demonstrate to them (and to yourself) that you are mature, capable, and do well in school while having a girl friend, they may be more receptive.<br>  <br>  Start slowly. Ask her to the prom soon so she can prepare. Go slowly and carefully. Introduce her to your parents; keeping a secret from them would be wrong. It would show that you do not trust them, that you are excluding them from a very important part of your life, and that you can not be trusted. You may be surprised, parents can be pretty supportive when their kids are involved. It sounds like they truly care about you and want the best for you.<br>  <br>  Go slowly in the relationship. Be friends with her first. THEN worry about dating and love and al the extra stuff. Friendship is stronger than dating. You will be much better off.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you.|`|QSAPw7AOaa	This sounds like a pretty near extreme amount of overprotection on the part of your parents, all due respect to them. No dating until you're 25 years old? Theoretically, you could very well be financially independent and living on your own by them. I understand your parents' view that education is very important but the idea that to some level the social scene will not interfere with a teenager's life is simply unrealistic. To me, to deny their kid the opportunity to go to a prom, which is, theoretically, a big event in a high school kid's life, (even though, just speaking for myself, didn't seem like that big of a deal), just tells me that they're out of touch with the basic social reality of teenagers.|`|zmu5PeEfaa	IM SORRY BUT HOW OLD ARE YOU!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  WHY ARE YOU LETTING YOUR PARENTS LIVE YOUR LIFE.<br>  IF YOUR OLDER ENOUGH TO HAVE A GIRLFRIEND WHY WAIT UNTILL YOUR IN YOUR 20'S ITS NOT YOUR PARENTS GIRLFRIEND IS IT!!!!!!      OR IS IT!!!!!!!!!!     <br>  GOOD LUCK|`|URBdbHP1aa	For a start, at 25 you are gone past the stage of beign an adult. Your parents have no control who you choose to see and that is fact. I moved out of my dads when i was 16 into my partners house who is 6 years older. The trouble it caused was unreal but 7 years down the line we are still together and doing very well. The point im making is, if you really like this girl, dont hold off because your parent wont allow you to date until yoru 25. Do what you feels best I think your parents are just scared of the worst (teenage pregnancy's etc). Perhaps talk to your mum and explain to her how you feel and reassure her than sex isnt even part of it. Good luck.
3iNobwVraa	Good golly!  Feel free to gloss over the details next time, lol.<br>  <br>  Ask her how she felt about it, or trust your instincts...you know her.<br>  And don't worry about prior people.  Sounds like you're doing just fine!|`|wFVsoAGGaa	First.  Baring any STD, what came out of her is normal.  As for her liking it, well, it's a sensitive area and so liking it does cause pleasure.<br>  <br>  Second.  The desire to know how many people she's slept with usually comes from some insecurity within you.  Why do you want to know?  Does knowing this change anything about your marriage?  If she is unwilling to give you an answer I would suggest you let it go.  Sacrifice your will for her own.  If she doesn't want to talk about it, but you do, fulfill your duty as a husband and die for her in that area, sacrifice what you want for what she wants.  Love is not an emotion, rather, it is an act of the will.|`|fPpmgxjuaa	yea i hope it wasnt some std discharge you licked up and swalloed...but it was prolly her ***...she prolly laughed at the face u made whenu tasted it lol...but u should ask her to be sure. <br>  n no u shouldnt b worried...if she told u would it change the relationship?|`|WUwIk3Fgaa	TMI is my response to your first question.....and my response to your 2nd question is that you definitely know she has slept with 5 or fewer guys. Why do you really care anyway? It's called the past. Leave it be.|`|31SFWKNvaa	Being that she just"***" I be willing to bet she didnt care you swallowed it. And maybe she just feels like its a personal question. Some women feel that way but also it normally just causes a fight.|`|4nqAS3sbaa	she probably sighed and giggled because she didnt know what just happened / she was stalling....? If she really liked it she would tell you or you would BE ABLE to tell, ya know?|`|9oirBmlLaa	lmao<br>  <br>  i hope that wasnt liquid discharge you swallowed|`|4zM5Zq1kaa	O.o Damn|`|qNMfaJ4Raa	She probably didn't even realize that anything came out of her and she can't really see what you're doing down there, unless you have a camera hooked up to a/v on a tv so she can watch you.|`|IvMPh09baa	Yuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck!  <br>  <br>  Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay toooooooooooooooo<br>  <br>  muuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuch infoooooooooooooooooooooooo!|`|naequcqlaa	Yes, by her reactions twds. you & what you did, I DO feel she did enjoy it all.  I would NOT be worried about her past tho.  This is her past & should be left just there...all in the past.  It's what she does now that she's w/you that should concern you.  Not things before she met you.  None of that is really of any importance anyhow.  You're going forward, not backward!  Good luck to you...:)|`|9KIICFdIaa	So she came in your mouth, don't you come in her mouth when she is giving you a ********? Seems to me like she liked the idea of you swollowing her fluids.

No, that is not a good plan.|`|hPNgeU2saa	if you love him date him, but be aware people with add can go really crazy and that can be hard to deal with|`|9DlYYjoCaa	A.D.D. is a lot different than something like Down Syndrome. A.D.D. just means that he's more hyper than usual(also cannot pay attention as well). Which can be fun right? And plus, who has to know he has A.D.D. just keep it to yourself for now. If you love him, who cares.|`|tbkNApqvaa	Your family and friends should respect your decision to date a guy with ADD, if you just found out and liked him before go for it|`|3pnQ5zhWaa	date the guy <br>  you liked him before he had add<br>  it dont matter just go with the guy<br>  wh ocares if your friend judges you<br>  at least you would have him<br>  if they were real friends they wont make fun of|`|4fC6EJWfaa	my fiance has ADD, it's not that bad.

(including me) even if it's not stated by a doctor. <br>  <br>  A.D.D. is just a fancy term for getting bored and not being able to focus sometimes.<br>  <br>  The way you are using it in your question makes it sound as if you are asking "Should i date a guy with A.I.D.S?" or "Should i date a guy with testicular cancer?"<br>  <br>  Really, A.D.D is no big deal at all... go for it.

Anyway maybe it just feels a lot tighter for him and maybe he hasnt done it with anyone else before, you may just look great from behind or maybe its his fetish. you should talk to him about it|`|JC06fESWaa	Its normal. Consider Chocolate its addictive coz it tastes so good but it makes you fat. Same thing with sex. I love sex and the "back door" as you say because it is so tight you just put it right in and like you feel the grip. I think that's why|`|37d59d30b548b7eff503880ca147a26aaa	Tightness..if you ask him he will tell you this. As far as how much is too much?

I've got a little "backdoor" obsession myself and I don't even really know why other than maybe because I don't do it hardly ever (like 4 times in my life).  I don't like to push the issue like your b/f seems to, though... my feeling is if she doesn't like it, and it's not really a pleasurable thing for BOTH of us, then we probably shouldn't be doing it.  (unless of course you are getting off on suffering for your b/f's pleasure)<br>  I guess it's something forbidden, maybe a little power trip in there and it's different ( a change of pace... yay! new hole!)  kidding aside I would not be comfortable doing my g/f in a way she didn't enjoy so I guess it sounds judgmental but I don't think that's healthy.<br>  <br>  Too much sex (or too much anything) I would define as when it affects normal living.  That is you are missing work, appointments, school, not eating or cleaning or otherwise neglecting the rest of your life for the sake of one thing... be it crack cocaine, sex or foosball.|`|AA11671841	youre addicted only if its all you want to do with every guy you see.. its a compulsion other wise you just have a strange hobby or fetish :)
1OxiOk2taa	I agree it is hard without knowing anything about your friend or their gender!<br>  You can make a friendship scrapbook- put in pics of your friends, and print out cute quotes from google images.<br>  <br>  Happy birthday to your freind!|`|Myt4vwTFaa	it's hard to know without knowing anything about your friend. maybe add some additional info on what they like, what you like to do together.<br>  maybe take them to a local show or concert. or find a cheap movie place and watch a LOT of movies there. <br>  go try on stuff at a thrift store. cheesy but fun. <br>  go to the beach and hang out, shop, eat some place near the beach.  <br>  hot air balloon ride?<br>  ask to play with the animals at the pet shops. it's fun.

But, your first, best (and safest) source, for ALL your informational needs is, and should be, -your parents. You know,...-they were your age, not too long ago, (even if you think they're ancient.) But, that's exactly the point! They're "ancient"; they've been around; they understand best, what you're now going through. So, drag Pop out to the garage, or wherever, and just say: "Hey, Dad, I met this chick, and she's like, totally awesome. What should I do?" -Now, if I WERE your dad, I'd tell you that, at 13, you're still too young to date. -But, that's just me. You have to do the one-on-one with your dad.

I had an ex that was so argumentative that she would always try and pull me into an argument over the smallest things.  Even her friends told her she was unreasonable.  However constantly being agreed with all the time can get boring quick.  Being bitchy is also a big turn off.  It is a lot easier to be with someone who doesnt try to make your life a living hell all the time just because she feels like it.

hw84xPRPaa	Love is an ability.<br>  Love is both substantial and con-substantial, which means that it is always real, not imaginary, and shared, not imposed. Love is actual, not powerful, because love can also be weak, as such is the nature of the heart.|`|0fcwsv7Vaa	a load of bull|`|sCECo8aZaa	Its a song from the movie "A Night At The Roxbury"|`|AA11865280	1 Corinthians 13
AA11231327	when you get back to school...act like you totally forgot about the letter...that way, if he didn't write you one back..it'll seem like it doesn't bother you that he didn't.<br>  <br>  but if he does write you one back..wait for him to give it to you, don't ask for it.<br>  <br>  because if he didn't..then it'll just be embaressing for you, ya know?<br>  <br>  so0o0o..if he really cares, he'll write you one, and he won't forget about it.<br>  <br>  so just wait it out. but like i said, if he never gives you one, or ever even mentions the one you wrote him...then act like you forgot and that it doesn't phase you and move on. good luck girl!!|`|AA10898603	That's pretty weird.... play if off like a joke but let him know you're actually kinda interested in him. But you want to break the ice with "the corney" love letter. Make sure you laugh a lot about it and always be the one who calls it a joke!|`|TT43pWMlaa	Acting. I love it. You should say to him that you just kidding. The reason you wrote the letter is you want to be with him. YOu want to share all your excitement with him. At last, he will love you.|`|xZigibGYaa	straight up write him another...then another...until you get yours.|`|mojg4PL0aa	When you get back to school pressing the matter probably wouldn't be the best thing to do. He might feel a bit pressured and that might push him away. Since you gave him a love letter I'm assuming you don't want that. I would play your first day back to school out just like a normal day. Treat him the same way you treated him before you gave him the letter. If he has a response to it he will give it to you either verbally or on paper. If, by the end of the day, he doesn't even acknowledge the fact that you gave him this letter, ask him if he has read your letter and if so what his view is. I wouldn't just immediately press the issue if I were you. The best friend thing also kind of complicates it. Either way if he doesn't see eye to eye with you on the subject, just reassure him that you'll remain friends either way. If you love him or like him this much just give it time and if it's meant to be it will. You've expressed your feelings for him it's in his hands now. Hope this helps a little bit.<br>  <br>  -Zach-|`|Kmtg5txSaa	You have 2 ways to do this, you can either call him, text him, message him now, and see him and hang out with him.<br>  <br>  Or you can just wait it out, if he is into you, you will definately get a letter back|`|qy07K2k5aa	Wait and see what her response is.

W9uYdJguaa	im sorry to hear that i would also be mad if i was in your situation. but first of all you should try and cool off before talking to him because nothing comes out right when your mad. then tell him how his actions hurt you and how you felt when all he got you was a pack of batteries and the candy bar he liked and that even though he didn't have money "i love you, happy birthday" still would have meant something. <br>  <br>  and if he still doesn't understand or doesn't try to make it up to you then its best to let him go. it will be hard because 15 months is a long time to just throw away. but at the same time you don't need a guy like him. you deserve better and can do better.|`|FmhUZLgoaa	Oh I would be very upset as well. I would be honest with him and tell him just how hurt you are about that. He is one of the only people that you want to hear "happy b-day" from and he couldn't do that.|`|8FbOtXAXaa	He sounds pretty selfish to me by knowing it was your birthday and not saying anything. I think maybe in the future you shouldn't go all out for him for holidays or his birthday if he can't even say happy birthday to you after he knew you were upset that he never said anything. I would just tell him you think that he is a jerk for not even saying anything about your birthday or trying to make it up to you and if he acts like it's no big deal then I would look at him like he wasn't a big deal and dump the jerk.|`|T4kc0bQmaa	Discuss this with him, tell him how you felt on your B'day. <br>  The best thing to do is talk. Don't let this upset you, I'm sure he didn't mean to hurt you, he must have had a valid reason.<br>  Don't worry, everything will be just fine.|`|7fow1Wngaa	im sorry he did that to u.. u shoud talk to him and work things out. but really u deserve someone who will treat u right and will do anythign for u to make u happy like how u'll do for dem.|`|AxH9mWKkaa	Have you tried telling him everything you just wrote? I know it is hard but if he really does care about you then he will respond appropriately. Let him know that you are hurt. It may seem obvious, but we all react differently when we are upset. Tell him you feel like you have always made an effort to make holidays nice for him and your upset about the way he treated your birthday. Chances are you aren't as upset about getting the batteries and candy bar as much as you are upset that he didn't take the time to truly celebrate your birthday. The possessions don't matter. Tell him that you don't care about a present, you just wanted him to remember your bithday.<br>  <br>  Tell him whatever you can. You should be comfortable telling him your worries, otherwise he isn't worth your time.
iYgEVKRRaa	i would try to get prof he's doing it with a tape recorder or something but the best thing to do is to aks your friends to be listening and when he does it go to the principal or a teacher and tell them what is happening, have your friends add what they've herd and back you up. keep going back until someone hears you out. no one should have to take that and you should be able to prove he's verbally abusing you if you get enough people to back you up. Remember that he's just a jerk and he shouldn't be able to harass you like that and not have to pay consequences for it. Also the more you complain that he's hurting your feelings and that you already have emotional issues with that stuff the more likely someone will be to listen to you.When you go to report it find a teacher that you know will listen and will likely back you up. the more support you have the more likely you can get help. fd|`|da0b7e1a848b40ea95138ba0c3f2caebaa	My guess is that he is jealous of you b/c you are best friends with the girl he wanted and didn't get, so he picks on you about your weight to make you look bad in front of her and your friends.  I know it's hard to see this from where you are, but in the grand scheme of things, high school means absolutely dick.  I graduated in 2004 and could not care less what happened in those 4 years.  I know it seems detrimental now, but you just kind of have to thicken your skin against things like that.  I have been called fat before by some assholes that I worked with (I'm 5'3", 135) and I just looked him in the eye and said "I may be fat but you're ugly, and that's forever!"  So just tell the guy to **** off.  Literally.  When he says something to you just say "Douche bag, shut your ******* face I'm tired of hearing your mouth".  If that doesn't work, smack him in the face with your lunch tray?  If you really think it would be easier to talk to teacher or something, go to your guidance counselor.  With all the high school shootings going on, they will take you seriously!  Just remember, in a few years, this guy will not be part of your life, so don't let him affect you to the point that it lasts into adulthood.  Focus on yourself, and if YOU think you need to lose weight, hit the gym!  You will feel better.|`|c0a5c8943ce6f1d0df1e342f2f780150aa	I had this problem for a long time. One day I snapped and I kicked his ***. he deserved it. I got suspended for a day but it was well worth it- he never bothered me again. And everyone else at school thought it was so cool that a girl gave him a good fat lip they supported me from then on.

XEBpv9gwaa	No such thing.  People can find other people they are compatible with and whom they could love at any age, and more than once.|`|jdRKZe18aa	Maybe this sounds terribly cynical, but the "soul mate" mentality is just a bit too "fantasy disneyfied" to me.  I think we're lucky & blessed if and when we meet & find someone that we connect with unlike any other person in our life time - and maybe even MORE than one such person.  BUT the whole term SOUL MATE is just not very realistic to me.  I think we can CREATE that kind of relationship with someone over time, years of investing, committing, loving, respecting, enduring etc - together MUCH MORE realistically then MEETING them like in some disney fairytale....<br>  <br>  Sorry....  BUT as to WHEN we meet such a person.... when the time, place and connection is right.  Could be any time and any age....|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	When they quit believing in fairy tales and acknowledge that there is no perfect person out there.

Once they accept this in themselves, they are able to accept it in other people, and truly love.|`|OHfZFR31aa	A soul mate can be at any age. A friend's father is 70 and just married a 68 year old woman and they are convinced they are soul mates. Both had been married and divorced previously and pretty much gave up on finding another person. But they met at a mutual friend's dinner party and have been inseparable ever since. He told me that he has never felt this way about anyone and didn't know what true love was until he met his current wife.|`|v3Y0Wij8aa	True soul mates are Destined to meet...this is a very deep soul longing that will guide them to each other...an energy that is so powerful that they will be drawn together like magnets, this energy is not bound by time and space....they are the the only one who will complete the masculine and feminine principles that are lacking in each of them..they fit so together perfectly and compliment each other in every way imaginable..also called twin flames.<br>  <br>  One can have many 'soul mates' in life, souls who incarnate together to help and mirror each other (friends, family members, lovers) and each soul contract you have with someone will be completed/dissolved once the lesson has been learned...and then you seem to just part ways...on to the next lesson and soul contract..some soul mate relationships can be very difficult and painful, they are your teachers..so to speak...so they can challenge you in ways you never imagined.<br>  <br>  Your True soul mate?...well, your souls will call out for each other, almost psychically..like a beacon of light that only the other can 'see' and you will trod through life searching for this person, this light, and when you are ready to meet..everything in God's time..you will meet...Destiny is at work here...no human hand in the pot...you can not 'find' your soul mate they 'find' you...you are drawn together...the soul's deep need to be together is unlike any you have ever felt, it is such a deep soul longing that once they meet they it would be impossible for them to separate...they are One now..complete...and there is no need to ever look elsewhere for Love. They will meet each other's needs almost magically, they are each other's light and dark, when one is in darkness the other brings light...and when one shines too brightly the other brings them darkness...keeping each other in perfect balace..in a world of dualities..they are perfect opposites..like yin and yang..understand? <br>  <br>  When do you meet your soul mate? When God says so...an not a minute before. It is the true blessed union of souls..no church is needed to sanctify that bond. It is a match literally made in Heaven. <br>  <br>  Some people never find their soul mate because they are searching for Love..in all the wrong places. Marriage partners are not always soul mates. This is why so many marriages fail..they souls are still longing for their True soul mate..and that kind of need will never be filled, but by the One.<br>  <br>  They have Agate Love and Eros Love in perfect harmony.

XEBpv9gwaa	If you want 50/50, go for it.  But don't have trying to get a lower CS bill be the reason.<br>  <br>  Is 658 the amount a court ordered?  If so, then you could just look at it as what has been deemed fair and go with it.  Your ex didn't make up that number, did she?  And if she filed with an agency, she was just doing what most people do, not "coming after you".<br>  <br>  Edit to respond to additional info:   Do you pay for the medical insurance or does your ex?  If your ex does, the majority of the 658 will be used by that.  If there is day care involved, that is going to be another 500 or more per month.  It's easy to see how a little kid could have that much in expenses, even though we as adults might not spend that much on ourselves.  Wasn't intended to be a negative comment, just a realistic one.  I can appreciate the stress that financial issues place on us, its not easy.|`|MMnjWEM7aa	I hope you get it because it sounds like you deserve it.|`|4C1gjMwbaa	If you are granted joint custody it is possible that you will pay $0 child support since the child splits even time with mother and father.

Good luck to you.|`|dnFjdJ72aa	maybe|`|5328e2d0d0f963d2ddb641db33165d74aa	They are gonna need to see income/bills/bank statements to determine the amount of child support you should be paying. you can always search "child support calculator" and that will give you a good estimate. if your doing things like paying for day care/child care, health insurance, or even if you take or pick your kid up from school...those things help out as well to lower your payments.<br>  <br>  Another way i got my payments lowered was when I explained to the judge that if my child support payments go up, i wouldnt be able to pay my mortgage and i will be forced to move to a different neighborhood that i feel isnt very safe for my child, and that is further away which will affect my travel and my income even more because im spending less time with my child and using more money for gas.<br>  <br>  I know have a shared custody of my son, He stays with me every other week. I take him to day care every morning and pick him up on my days off, his mother picks him up only on the days im working.

Good Luck.|`|kYGIAu5Kaa	Kind of scary but I am JUST starting to get into this with my Ex. I am finding that the courts are more and more willing to give dads what they deserve than they used to. It is going to be an uphill battle for you and me also but I am confident that if dads like us continue the fight eventually it will get easier and the courts will come to the realization that is does not take a village to raise a child all it takes is 2 parents... the key to that statement is 2 Parents not just a mother...<br>  <br>  Good luck get a good lawyer and keep on fighting.|`|1xNsWOnOaa	If you get 50-50 time with your daughter your support should go down because it is partly based on how much time the child is with you.  I would recommend an attorney because my bf was pro-se and got burned, no extra time and has to pay lots of $$.  Make sure you have a child support worksheet filled out and find out exactly how much she makes because that will help off-set what you pay too.  Good luck.

This worked for me in bars several times. Find the girl you want and just have casual talk. Then look around and comment on how nice some of the other guys seem to be. And then tell her you will help her get someone that she thinks is attractive. All along you are becoming her friend, but not putting pressure on her or yourself. Find what her interests and likes are, and then proceed with the "Hey I like to do that to" "I am doing _____ on Saturday, would you like to go just as friends? You seem to be such a nice person"<br>  After the friend part...everything falls into place.<br>  I used to get women way out of my league this way and it blew my friends minds. All they could do is ask "Why"<br>  The key is to appear to not have an objective because then SHE will think that the choices are hers.

I know your shy, and your a nice guy and you dont wanna mess anything up or regret anything but dude your shyness is cute and cuddly now but it'll be a crutch in the future. Just walk right up to her, or write her a letter but either way be forward and assertive. Tell her you've liked her for a while and that you would like to go out with her some time. You don't have to spend money on her if you can't afford it man, but chicks don't think like we do, she'd be happy as long as you guys were hanging out, because your young and nieve.  I know you get that damn wierd feeling in your stomach and you wanna blush and you feel like you want to say something but you can't, trust me man i know and the only way out of it is to go up to her and say something. DO NOT BE SCARED OF REJECTION, it really doesn't matter, its apart of life and it isnt that big of a deal, you just smile and move on to the next girl that you like. you wont regret it...|`|GvnBc2tSaa	Start off with the little things like saying hi as you walk past or asking how her day was, and eventually maybe get her number and start making friends with her... this could lead to hanging out in the weekend and just having a really good friend or gf!

cOce5YbRaa	My goodness, this is a sticky situation. First off your Mom has no right to treat you or your daughter like she does. Your Mom shows no respect for you or your daughter either. I admire the heck out of you that you had your daughter and kept her and you have made it all these years without anyone including your Mom not helping you. To me it seems like your Mom is extremely jealous of you and your daughters relationship. If I was you, I would try to avoid my Mom as much as possible. I know she is your Mom but enough is enough already. So what if you didn't do what she wanted you to do with your life. As long as you and your daughter are happy that's all that should matter. But your Mom wanted you to do so many other things with your life but you chose life over that. That shows you are the best and a much bigger person than your Mom ever could be. Please don't take me wrong. I'm not downing your Mom. My Mom was too very hateful to my step-kids. The kids always treated her nice and tried to get close to her but she was always just a hateful person, even when I was growing up. She was still hateful until she passed away. I gave up my life and took care of her for the last 5 1/2 years of her life and I never once heard the words Thank You, but I never did that I can remember ever my whole life. It hurt me really bad and still did and I am a nearly 48 year old woman now. You have ALOT to be proud of. Yourself and your daughter and the fact that you have always provided for yourself and your daughter. I feel so sorry for your daughter. I know how she feels all too well. Just keep up the great work in letting her know how special she is and try to keep her away from your Mom as much as you can. You can't avoid all contact but maybe at least some of it. Tell your Mom in a nice but firm way that you are tired of her hurting you and especially your daughter and if she doesn't stop that maybe she shouldn't come over to your house for a while. I know this will be hard to do, but it might be the only way to wake your Mom up. Tell your daughter what I told you about my Mom and that it isn't her fault. Some people are just that way and I don't think they really mean to be but they are. I wish you and your daughter the very best and hope everything gets better for both of you and also with your Mom. It's so sad for family to act like this but my whole family has never been close and I have lost both of my parents now and so I don't talk to any of my family except for one of my Aunts. It's sad but sometimes you have to put yourself and your kids first and to heck with everyone else. I'm sorry this has happened to you and your daughter. Ask your Mom why she acts like that and says things like she does around her Granddaughter. See what she has to say. Maybe if you bring it to her attention more it will help. I sure hope so. Good luck and God bless you and your sweet daughter.|`|Ff7mCzlPaa	If your mother is still going on about this after 15 years, she has HUGE issues!  I'm sure this isn't the only issue she rages on and on about, is it?<br>  <br>  she's a control freak, hon.<br>  <br>  if my mother did that, i'd avoid her like the plague and my daughter wouldn't be exposed to her rudeness.<br>  <br>  i'd also let my daughter know that people who say mean things have problems, are bored with their own lives and are lacking self-value so have to point out the problems of others to make themselves feel better... And my daughter would also know that it's not her fault, never was.  I'd encourage my daughter to accept my controlling mother for the miserable person she is.  Once we can accept others at face value and gain some understanding to why they sometimes behave in a rotten manner, we can move forward without being bothered by their ignorance.|`|QE2hNXeCaa	After 15 years it seems like your mother has not tuned into reality. Yes, she probably did not expect you to become a mother at such a young age and I do not blame her for having issues adjusting to it but she has had more than enough time. Besides, it doesn't do any good to the family that she clings on to the past like that. What matters is that you and her grandchild are healthy, safe an living a good life. She is really trying to attack you. I don't think she wants to punish you but this is how she directs her frustrations and lost dreams. Not very mature. What I would do is tell her, briefly and strongly that you are happy with your life and that you have made peace with the past. She should be able to do that at least. Also, I would not let my kid around her until she promises to change her attitude and moderate her comments. It's not appropriate and while it is painful for you that she is so mean your daughter has absolutely no part in this. If she continues to be this vile then I would say put distance between you and her. Don't hate her and don't argue, no drama is the way to go but politely take steps to see her less and less. Your mother is a grown woman, she should be able to reason and decide what is best for her on her own but your daughter is young and she still needs you to protect her and guide her. Good luck.|`|auOBJNEGaa	If you've repeatedly told her how much this hurts you and your daughter, I think you should give her an ultimatum. Either she stops with the hurtful comments or you don't see her anymore. It sounds extreme but sometimes that what people need to see what they're doing wrong or to get their priorities straight (that she'd rather have you in her life than make snarky comments). As for your daughter, tell her how much you love her and like you said here, how she's your world. Make it clear that she has no fault in this.|`|n6RASb3jaa	call her a ***** and blame everything on her bad parenting <br>  <br>  no don't do that it is immature but it might work|`|MlCWsBcwaa	Perhaps your mother has some guilt (blaming herself for your young pregnancy) or jealousy (of how close you and your daughter are) or otherwise feels bad (e.g. how good a job you have done as a parent despite all of this).  You have tried talking about it, and that isn't working, so she must be a real pain to deal with sometimes.  Maybe it is time to get firm.  While not being rude, I would say look mum, I love you and know you want the best for me, but my daughter is the best thing in my life and I wouldn't change that.  I love you and want you in both of our lives.  But, if you insist on continuing to tell your granddaughter that her existence is such a bad thing, I won't let you near her to do it.  I have mentioned this before and you have taken no notice of me.  I don't want to fight with you or be ungrateful for all you have done for me, but I am putting my foot down on this.  You are hurting ------- every time you say these things, in case you haven't realised it.  It is up to you, and I really do care about you.  Or something like that - in a calm way and where your dad or some other people that are close enough for it to be not really embarrassing but who have witnessed what you have said and how.  Good luck.|`|tVPyRHEJaa	that is great that you have a good relationship with  your daughter.<br>  tell your mother that it was your choice to have your daughter and it was a right choice, tell her also to stop blaming you and your daughter and if she doesn't stop she will loose you and your daughter. tell her you will cut her off your life if she won't stop saying things that hurts your daughter's feelings.  and if she doesn't show by little example,  stop seeing her at family gatherings,  make sure  she will not see you, etc<br>  she has to learn the hard way

Or whatever else you do, just make it feel like its really special.<br>  <br>  Then afterwards, give him a back massage or something, and then relax with him, let him lay in your lap (if he's that type) or whatever he wants to do as long as he is relaxed and feels like he doesn't have to worry about anything at the moment. Nothing is better than food, sex, and no worries. Any man would love you for that.|`|axaD1D0Caa	You can decorate his Door with a welcome back sign with a few balloons and streamers
a3422bad6666b60894e80bace0f14387aa	If you are doing a simple ceremony and have nothign you need or want people to know, then you don't need them. I think they are necessary for ceremonies with audience participation. For instance, I once attended a Catholic Wedding Mass and it had no programs. All of the other non-Catholic guests had no idea what was going on and it was very hard to follow all the kneeling/standing/praying/responses without a program. If your ceremony is basic or uninvolved, you won't need them if you really don't want them. I like them though ( =<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|Xzvoz6mcaa	No they aren't.  I didn't have any at my wedding and everyone got along just fine without them.  :)|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	yeah, skip the favors at the reception too.  no one will notice, believe me.|`|RuKK1LYiaa	I'm in the same exact sittuation as you, married in the same place as reception (same room even) tight budget and cutting costs whereever possible, Dont worry about the programs most people get them and throw them away afterwards anyway unless they collect stuff  like that. I wouldnt waste the money on them and i'm not actually, if they dont realise that a wedding is the same as anything else somethings wrong with them, then again if your having a singer or a person reading something you could creatively do something instead of a program such as a poster as they are coming in listing everything a program would, its cute easy and cheap since you can make it yourself. Good Luck.|`|caa265fc73cd7f24fe83d9a186ac1af9aa	They are not necessary.<br>  <br>  I happen to have a number of guests with hearing difficulties.  They are the only reason I am having a program because I am printing the entire service in it so the guests with hearing difficulties will be able to read along and follow the service.|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	If you are on a tight budget, you can easily skip them. The only time you need them is if you are having a religious ceremony (Catholic Mass et al) where guests would be completely lost without a program.|`|rJJhMQ37aa	I've never been to a wedding where they had programs.  You don't need them.|`|qRIMM2ycaa	Only if your wedding is long, and complicated or very unique and unexpected.<br>  <br>  Otherwise, I think most people know how weddings typically work.|`|crxbob5jaa	They are no necessary. They serve to let guests know who the attendants are, but you don't have to have them. Not a problem.|`|AleWgjvPaa	We were in the same boat and decided that they were an unnecessary expense since very few people actually keep them. So we just printed out the hymn, two per page and that was all.|`|ddXDh7rCaa	Its a nice touch to have them, but if your budget is a bit tight I think it would be fine not to have any.  <br>  <br>  Good luck with the wedding|`|o503YPrqaa	I don't think they are necessary. I don't think I will have them either. I think you can do with out.|`|25bf37e0a92ccb8a258d3686a5324e72aa	I don't think that they are necessary at all and if you do them, I would print them on regular paper in B&W no one keeps them or really looks at them IMO.|`|ngkNaQJeaa	ha ha ha no you dont need them|`|X8C9Zwj9aa	I think wedding program is not necessary for weddings. You can have a smooth and good ceremony even if it's not provided. But if you want, you can have a few of it printed to track the program. <br>  have a great wedding and good luck to both of you.<br>  <br>  Need more for your wedding? <br>  See source below for great stuff!|`|9XJZB0Emaa	I have been to tons of weddings and honestly the only time I have seen them was at the big over the top weddings.  Most do not do them anymore.  If it is in the budget then they can be cute, but you do not have to, we are not even thinking about them.|`|vyL7yEleaa	you don't have to have them, there are many weddings that don't have them. they are just a very nice touch to the wedding and you can easily make them yourself for like $20. <br>  <br>  but if you budget is really tight you don't need them|`|rNUB8B6Vaa	you dont really have to have them. I guess its for the ones that want to keep a schedule i guess. My sis is getting married in one month and she doesnt want them she says they are unnecessary. i think that too.
zka26204aa	Tell her that you will take care of her finances, but unless she allows you to do that, you can not help her.<br>  <br>  It really depends on what you call irresponsible.  Is she just trying to enjoy life more, considering it is her last few years on earth, or is she just throwing money away on things she never uses or needs.<br>  <br>  An older person might as well be dead, if they have no enjoyment in life.  Keep that in mind.  Getting old, does not mean you do not need to experience enjoyment.  As a matter of fact, it is important to their health that they maintain an active and happy life, or it will shorten their life span.

cQ22MEU6aa	So it sounds like your question is if you should break it off with him and if so how do you go about doing it?  Well first of all if someone smokes and even though they know that you don't like it or it bothers you and they continue to do it they don't have much respect for you or your wishes.  You say he knows you don't like it, but have you asked him not to smoke around you?  I think it would only be fair to make your wishes known.  <br>  <br>  If you have nothing in common with this person then what was the initial attraction in the beginning?  Were you just friends who crossed the line or what?  I think you need to be true to yourself and get out of a relationship that no longer seems to be satisfying you.  Since you have so many doubts about the relationship it should be clear that this is not the one for you.  <br>  <br>  You have a kind heart and you therefore don't want to break his heart.  Believe me we have all had broken hearts before and we have survived them.  Of course we were pathetic and we cried, begged and pleaded with our significant other if we were the ones who got dumped.  Life sure goes on and he will be okay.  He may even surprise you.  Don't let guilt keep you in a relationship that you're not happy in.  <br>  <br>  Besides the stars do not lie.  If they say it would be a disaster they are probably correct.  But my advice to you is find out on your own.  You don't say how long you have been in the relationship with Jamie.  Is it worth trying to salvage?  Good luck.  Keep your head up.|`|yWbJYuGXaa	You're going to have to talk to him, one way or the other, you should never do anything that you don't want to do, and I know that you said that he gets heartbroken and it's sad, but you could be really good friends- maybe just tell him to....wait it out- point out that he smokes in front of you and even says that he doesn't want to.....you should confront him- that's the only way that won't make your relationship/friendship a disaster in the end...hope this helps and good luck!|`|vUAuWcXuaa	Dont talk to him for now take some time for yourself and really think about what you want...and when it comes down to it and you do end up leaving him know that every break up is hard and someone always gets hurt unless its mutual and even then people tend to still get hurt. When i have mind bottling questions like this i think about my future. Five years from now do you see yourself being happy with him or miserable?? Only you can be the judge of that.|`|fQUUG68Iaa	Well, you can do the obviose and talk to him. I know you said not to say that but you can.<br>  or you can say look, i have talked to you, and im sorry but i think im done. I just dont think this can work out any longer. <br>  I'll see you around.<br>  Then leave. Then he will be the one that will want to talk things out.|`|ZO2qVAyMaa	My bestfriend had a boyfriend who smoked but NOT infront of her.He obviously doesnt care about what you think so its not worth being with him.Your probably a very pretty girl and ur gonna have to get used to breaking up with a lot of guys but you shouldnt be scared to stand up for urself!!<br>  <br>  or heres the slutty way to deal with this<br>  <br>  cheat on him...kiss another guy infront of his FACE thats what he gets for not caring about what you feel about him smoking|`|QwYfHol4aa	Do what is best for you. Depending on how long you have been dating he shouldn't love you THAT much. If seeing him is that bad then you obviously should leave him. Just give him all the reasons straight out, and once you do, make the effort to be his friend after. If you don't he'll hate you forever.|`|7LtMU8MTaa	Just go ahead and burn him with his cigarette/joint. He'll probably be scared to smoke in front of you ever again, thus that problem is solved. If he continues to smoke, just withhold all types of oral/anal/vaginal sex. This will turn him around. You're welcome!|`|aaVd7oacaa	Break up!! Even if breaking up would hurt HIM, you're hurting yourself by staying. He can find ways to get over a break up -- we all have to. And smoking is just as bad for your health (second hand) as it is for his.|`|chhPYDQiaa	ok first guys are guys they can take it just break his heart he will most likely quit smoking and keep asking u back but make sure he quits or else he will win|`|1ZEYIsPAaa	You know what you want & you answered your own question...."this relationship that I really want to get out of." Honestly you will be doing him a favor by breaking it off as soon as possible. Just keep telling yourself that you deserve better & a broken heart does heal. He will probably find a smoker that he has a lot in common with and be happier in the end. In fact maybe that is exactly what you can say to him when you break up. Also tell him that you realized that you have been trying to change him and that just means that you two were not meant to be. Good luck!|`|O0rpPItWaa	when hes smoking in front of you walk up and just pull the cig out of his mouth and be like "no do it somewhere else" and if he gets ticked say "well you told me you werent going to do it in front of me" and the horoscope stuff i believe in too, but i also believe in working things out. and YES you DO need to talk to him, give him body language. tell him what you dont like and like. let him know if he does what you dont like in front of you he wont have a chance of staying together much longer. dont be a total B*** about it just let him know what you;ll take and not take. and doubts are normal they come and go. do something fun with him that will spark things up again.. answer mine?<a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AmE5ARBQkRJdEsYVmq09Y3zsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090309162118AAfoGfA">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|jceUAJtyaa	I understand that smoking is a huge turn off, and the fact that he says that he doesn't like doing it in front of you, yet he does it anyway isn't a good sign of trustworthiness .<br>  If you have nothing in common, then the feeling of annoyance at that will just get worse over time.<br>  I understand that that you have (or had) strong feelings for each other, but it sounds like you have so many problems, that it would be better if you went separate ways.<br>  I'm not gonna tell you to leave him and not look back, but I think that you should just take a break for a while, and see how it feels.<br>  If he loves you as much as you say, then he should try to stop smoking.<br>  <br>  But sometimes, if you're not meant to be, then you're not meant to be.|`|oJ4af1Gqaa	first of all u need to know that you cant let people talk you into a relationship that you want no part of. trust me. second, never trust those horoscope things...they are never exact. if you dont like him smoking in front of you tell him to stop or u cant stay around him bc ur parents think that ur smoking and its getting you in trouble or ur allergic to smoke...make up an excuse. if he keeps smoking in front of you you need to confront him. tell him that u hate the smoking. u even said that you and him had nothing in common so why be in the relationship.<br>  trust me sweetie, the heartache and pain is not worth the relationship.|`|pOmjcVjZaa	This sounds exactly like my brother and best friend (yes, best friend and twin brother, weird, I know-pretty much I know what you're going through). Honestly, if he REALLY loved you, he wouldn't smoke (my brother quit for his girlfriend), so take that into consideration. And if you're talking about cigarettes, support him, help him quit. If you're talking about weed, there's no reason he shouldn't be able to quit-it's not addicting. And I know that you said you've told him not to smoke in front of you, but did you tell him why or how much it hurts you? If not, try that. But, then again, you don't want to be in the relationship. My best answer for you, don't make it abrupt if you're going to break up with him. Just slowly stop hanging out, or talking, or anything. That will make the bond weaker. By then, I'm sure that he'll start to lose interest in you, so the break up wouldn't be so harsh. <br>  If you need more advice, just ask me.|`|rcut6bhoaa	I think you should get out of the relationship.  It isn't worth wasting your time (and his) for something that isn't going to happen.  I know it seems hard, and your concerned about his feelings, but wouldn't you want the same respect back if he felt this way about you?  Good Luck|`|sZSGDDcYaa	Talking is of course the 100% guarantee way to get your point accross about the smoking. Don't always listen to a horoscope. They are not always accurate. You talk about how much he loves you but your love has faded. That should be a huge hint to you as you no longer have a desire for him. Honestly, talk to him about your feelings, see if doing things that you normally don't do as a couple makes things more fun and exciting maybe within those moments you will find common ground. If you come to breaking up doing it gently and tell him its for the best and that if he truly loves you, he will allow you to feel guilt free about having a break so you can collect yourself. <br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  ps. Don't let men rule you over, if you don't feel comfortable in the relationship or you are scared over come that. If you don't you'll be living in a pressured relationship.|`|AA10841164	Tell him to stop smokin' around you or in general my teenage friend did it!<br>  Well just tell him if he doesn't stop its over ya know. Or you could be mean and break up with him like this: I want you out of my life because I've told you numerous times that I don't want u smokin' in front of me WE ARE OVER!<br>  That is what I would do if I were you. Figure out somethin' else if you don't like my ideas. <br>  <br>  Smile8D|`|iOpzTvSpaa	Break up!! Even if breaking up would hurt HIM, you're hurting yourself by staying. He can find ways to get over a break up -- we all have to. And smoking is just as bad for your health (second hand) as it is for his.|`|DkVofG9paa	whats your question?|`|x7duxnBLaa	If you're not feeling good when you're with him, the chemistry isn't right and also it doesn't sound like a compatible relationship all the way around.  Look for someone who cares about you and is willing to make changes and improvements.<br>  <br>  One of the things that really impressed me about my husband when we were dating was as soon as he found out that smoking bothered me, he stopped smoking cold turkey!  You want to be with someone you're happy with when your with them.  There are too many good guys to settle for someone you're not happy with.  Good luck.|`|zY7boFYNaa	Well, you know what?<br>  If it's all in negativity, you should just let it go, you should not be in a relationship that you feel like uncomfortable and awkward especially with the smoking, it's not right, you should always set up your boundaries first in your beginning of the relationship remember that. You should let it go!|`|D2cCZVQXaa	You can't always get what you want. In this case, you have already made up your mind that you don't want to be with him. It's hard to get out of a relationship when someone is emotionally attached. If you think you will be happier not being with him, then you should say so and stay away from him for a little bit. It will give him time to throw a pity party. They always get over it. You can move on if you want to.|`|1378862e7f14f3d6b3ca9f2e14f3ba94aa	ok i know exactly wut u shud do<br>  <br>  i know u new i wuz gunna say this but u should talk to him, and say ur not interested anymore and try to hook him up w/ another hot girl.<br>  <br>  it works every time<br>  <br>  God Bless<br>  <br>  ps- that way he wont feel like u dumpt him and just left|`|WitqRbfaaa	okay i would tell him he better stop smoking or its over, it will hurt him but if he really cares about you he will stop or at least try sorry if its not detailed enough but thats what i would do|`|9X4inaEpaa	umm he might get u to start smoking and well its not worth it|`|Io35X5kfaa	Well obviously he doesnt care THAT much about you if he smokes right infront of you when he knows you hate it. But yeah, if he gets very sad and heartbroken, you have to break up with him the easiest way I think. Because I dont think you should go out with him from what you said here... so maybe you should tell him that his smoking bothers you like non-other and that he has to prove to you that he really loves you and maybe you will stay, but if he says he doesnt have to prove himself or something then I would tell him that it is hurting you inside a lot but you cant be with him.  OR you could MAKE him not like you by doing things you know he hates.. haha just an idea.  But the most sweetest best way to do it, is to go up to him straight and yes talk it out and tell him you cant possibly be with him if he smokes and that he has to change. Or like I said, if you want him gone for good, then tell him that you want to be just very good friends and then give him options on who else he could have as a girlfriend.|`|XwyUATsKaa	You sound like you're young enough to take time now to enjoy dating for what it is.  Part of this process is learning what you like and don't like. I wouldn't date someone who smokes.  You know why?  Because I am an ex-smoker and I don't want to start smoking again.  Also, smoking stinks!!!   I think you read your horoscope and see it as a sign for you to move on because you really want to.<br>  <br>  As for dealing with someone who you KNOW will get emotional when you break up: Tell someone you will be breaking up with him and don't be afraid to do it over the phone.  For your safety and to avoid not actually going through with it, you should cover yourself that way.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|djNeNEOuaa	If you want out do it NOW, If you wait it will only hurt him more in the long run. As far as your horoscope goes that doesn't mean anything, me and my wife have been together for more then 5yrs, and we are supposed to hate each other according both the zodiac and Chinese astrology. It sounds like you are looking for excuses to break up.
kBXCwNT5aa	this is gonna be hard if you can't be friends and talk to him you can sabotage them and make him or her break up. Next there is no way to talk to people on facebook without having one. You can see if he has any other email or aim. Starting iming him so it won't be as awkward. Next ask him to the movies with a group of friends then you can make your move or at least get his number.

i81cQUyhaa	Email Him,You Love Him so get Him back
XT81GCu1aa	You seem really sweet and this situation sucks for you.  I think you should pull out completely, not give him a month b/c he seems to be going back and forth- do you really believe that after a month he will cut off contact with her, even if he chooses you?  I really doubt it, especially since she seems so aggressive and desperate for a partner/father figure for her kids.  Plus, I am struck by the fact that his "other lady" is saying things to you that are completely out of line.  It is not her business to tell you what to do with him, etc.  He should stand up for you and tell her not to speak to you in that manner even if you were just his friend.<br>  <br>  I would leave him alone- too much drama, and he seems to be attracted to ladies with drama.It is not fair for him to pull your emotions back and forth like that, and to be intimate with you (and you can bet your buns he is being intimate with her too.)  Just pull back from this situation and try to get busy with your friends and meet someone else.  If he does break this off, let him approach you and make sure it is COMPLETELY broken off.  It will only hurt you to be friends with him right now, b/c it sounds like you are in love with him and that would just be hurtful to you right now.<br>  <br>  Look out for your own heart now.

8w3Nfenyaa	Yes, because after prom it might become something really special.|`|KITovxGvaa	No, you should have more self-respect and dignity than to be his third choice.|`|AA11651312	Personally, I would love to see you turn him down. And being curious, why did both of your friends turn him down? I hope its not because he's a bad guy. If he is, listen to your friends!!! <br>  <br>  I would only say yes, if you're content & confident in knowing you were his 3rd choice. AND PLEASE...PLEASE...PLEASE, Whatever you do - do not compare yourself to your friends and think you do not measure up to them over what some stupid little boy thinks. Do you have any other options? Is there anyone else you like, that you would consider going to prom with?<br>  <br>  I think the most important question is can you still see yourself having fun with him at prom? Normally, I'd tell you to say no to him cause of what he did to you - but then I remember its just high school prom...where most people take dates they're just friends with and its really not that big of a deal. Some even go solo now (nothing wrong with that). I'd say yes to him, if you can see yourself having fun with him. Who knows, maybe at prom he'd realize what a terrific girl you are. But please before you say yes, do not get your hopes up. Ask yourself honestly.... since you like him - if prom doesn't make him like you or get feelings for you - are you gonna be secretly disappointed the whole night? If the answer is YES, please go with someone else!!!! Ask yourself how you would feel if being his date, he were to ask someone else to dance. It does happen, unfortunately (what scumbags guys are at that age!!) Prom is suppose to be a fun night with your friends, not a time for you to be disappointed. Well, best of luck to you. And enjoy your prom!!!

Dont worry and good luck and hope hes doing well in Little League|`|AA10065812	I’ve been a Father’s Rights Advocate for 20 years.   <br>  <br>  Many think the courts are rigged against dads, but in reality, it is more about attorneys unwilling or lacking the knowledge to truly fight for the father's rights.  This is why it is important to learn how to interview and hire the right attorney.  It is also important to do as much as possible on your own and not pay the attorney to do it.<br>  <br>  Part of the problem with getting your rights knowing what to do to prove your case, and how to remind the judge of their responsibilities.  Let me start with the judge.<br>  <br>  Always take people with you to court who are not there to testify.  Make sure they are sitting where the judge can see them, each equipped with a tablet and pen to take notes.  It’s best to use a Court Watch Form designed for this purpose.  I have one in the manual at Dads House.<br>  <br>  If the judge is not doing his job, using the info from this form, you can, appeal, and/or get  the judge sanctioned and removed from the case.  You file a complaint with the State Supreme Court at your state capital.<br>  <br>  Start keeping a daily journal of all your activities.  The most common way to prevent a father from getting his rights through the courts is a false allegation, usually sexual.  Over 60% of divorcing father are accused of child sexual abuse, of which only 4% are found to have any relevance, but there are no penalties for doing so.  A daily journal is your number one piece of evidence in court and you can even refer to it while on the stand.  <br>  <br>  Gather evidence.  Check the site below to see if it is illegal to record conversations without the other person knowing.  If your state does not have a law either way, than it defaults to the federal ruling which says one person in a conversation must know they are being recorded.  You’re that one person.  In Missouri it is specifically legal, in Kansas there is no mention either way.  If you live in two different states, and one has a law against it, than it applies when the call originates from within that state,<br>  <a href="http://www.rcfp.org/taping/" rel="nofollow">http://www.rcfp.org/taping/</a><br>  <br>  Now, you can't just record, you also have to transcribe it into the daily journal.<br>  <br>  If you want to learn how to do all this go to Dads House in Yahoo Groups.  There's an educational manual in the file section that can teach you what you need to know.  Take the time to learn what you can and should do.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/DadsHouse/">http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/Dad...</a><br>  <a href="http://tinyurl.com/GiveKidsAChoice" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/GiveKidsAChoice</a><br>  <a href="http://www.fathersandfamilies.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.fathersandfamilies.org/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.parentalalienation.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.parentalalienation.org/</a>|`|wpi36XBAaa	If you can prove that you are taking all the steps possible to deal with his condition - doctor's visits, prescription cremes/ointments, the receipt for the body armor, soap replacements, etc. then there's little the ex can do unless she can prove that his condition improves while in her care. Get his doctor to write report on the type of eczema and his recommended treatment of your son's condition. <br>  By the way, another avenue to explore is food and environmental allergies, as they are quite often associated with eczema. <br>  Eczema is not on its own a sign of bad parenting.

Wait until you miss each other a lot before talking on the phone, then wait two more days before you see each other.

In a public place, it is like he is partly watching the movie and partly paying attention to you. If you were at home in bed, would you let him do this while watching TV ? You would never know which he found more interesting.|`|lK3TXGBOaa	woooow.... okay....random....... i dont think you should be doing those things first of all..... you sound kinda young to me....... respect yourself so guys dont treat you like a slut  ( no offense) but usually when you allow them to do that youll just be a booty call and thats it...|`|22d5af33c05c043b6990ced7809ac661aa	why are you posting this on yahoo? <br>  <br>  if you cant tell which is easier, a skirt or jeans...

EDwKdJ1xaa	Oh no girlfriend! You need to get the police involved as much as how embarrassing it is. If he's starting to act wierd and send you weird text messages,that's a red flag! If he does that,then what else is he capable of? I say be safe and stop it as early as possible before it gets too out of hand. That's my best advice.
Fp2EEl36aa	it would bother me too.  my bf wouldn't like it if i went to lunch by myself with some guy.  so he shouldn't do the same.  tell him that.  if he was going with a group, then it would be cool.  but by themselves? no.|`|0LqslIMLaa	Just tell him that you are intimidated and a bit jealous, but do NOT get angry. Nothing is more put offing then an angry jealous girlfriend. Just be sweet and be very caring. "Honey, I don't like it that you go out with them, I know I'm being foolish or silly but I feel really intimidated and jealous."<br>  <br>  He most likely will try and re-assure you. There's nothing wrong with it and you are just being a little annoyed, your not wrong for being upset but neither is he for going. Just express to him your feelings in a very nice way and hopefully he will re-assure you to feel safe and secure in your relationship.

She wasn't in this marriage alone, and she sure didn't create the problems all by herself. It isn't fair to blame her just because she was the one who broke the news to you, or took the first step. It is their marriage, and for them to work out or not, as hard as that may be for you. If you feel like you need to vent, then do it with a friend or a counselor or a therapist...NOT your mom. I assure you, this is not easy for her either. You really have no idea what has gone on between them, and that part of it is really none of your business. You're entitled to want them together, but you're certainly not entitled to make demands, yell, and act like a child who isn't getting what they want, so they're throwing tantrums. <br>  <br>  I know I probably sound harsh, but really, your old enough to handle this like a grown up and be a bit more in control of yourself. Like I said, find a friend, a counselor, a therapist...someone you can talk to until you've reached acceptance. And then apologize to your mom, tell her you are not happy with their decision, but that you love and support both of them, and you understand that even if they can't live with each other you know they both still love you.|`|X7i59NeIaa	Hey, knock it off. You have no right to yell at your mother. You have no idea of what she has put up with from your Dad. You don't know how your Dad feels either. This is between your Mom and Dad and has nothing to do with you. You are an adult now so act like one. I'm sure that both of your parents love you very much. There is no reason why you can't spend time with both of them. You just want things your way. Well maybe they stayed together as long as they could for you. Now it is your turn. Let them go and don't place judgments on them. Yeah, I know it is hard to see your parents break up but you do have to let them make their own decisions. Just let them know that you love them and that you will support their decisions.|`|AA12351814	This is something that  has to be handled between your mom and dad.  It is not your relationship to worry about.  I know you feel for your dad but what goes on between them is private and frankly none of your business.  I know that you think you have a say in it but your mother and father are in an an intimate relationship that only they can control.  It has nothing to do with you, they love you and always will.  They are really sad right now but you giving your support to both of them will go a long way.  Don't be mad at your mother, there are things you don't know about and she will never tell you so back off.|`|SdOtY7Isaa	my parents got a divorce when i was 10 and im now 15 . <br>  it was more traumatizing then depressing for me.. <br>  it was almost scary hearing my parents screaming at eachother at 4 in the morning every night for 6 months.. <br>  but,, you WILL get over it.<br>  and you seem to love your dad. you seem like a daddys boy.. <br>  so why not go live with him for a while?<br>  maybe itll ease the pain a little. <br>  but... if the fog doesnt raise within 3 weeks to a month.. <br>  you should consider getting a counsler and maybe anti-depressents.<br>  anti-depressents saved me from suicide almost.<br>  but, they wont take you out of the depression if you dont make action to also move from the depression.<br>  these are the levels of pain in losing someone/ or a relationship<br>  1-denial<br>  2-grief<br>  3-anger<br>  4-sadness<br>  5-refreshing [getting over it]<br>  <br>  you will get through this. good luck

Don't worry, your secret's safe with me.|`|mdBR9Ynxaa	thats crazy|`|PevKGmeFaa	maybe you guys should open up your range of friends. you guys are all hanging out too much and now this is what it's come too. friend love trianglish squarish type of stuff... get out more. if your feelings are still there...then go for it. why you should you be sad all the time|`|vimfbSxfaa	lola probelly still in the groupe cause she like fred and i think lola should stop talking about all her drma cause dang girl, dose anything else happen in that group? lol <br>  so she should just get what she want and get over it..... get it girl....<br>  <br>  lol i actually read the whole thing.|`|xZigibGYaa	jesus christ.  just have the orgy already.  dean sounds like a douchebag that still loves lola and can't stand that she doesn't like him.<br>  <br>  if fred and lola like each other, the group should respect that.  **** dean, he's a turd.|`|1ZuF9FdSaa	Dean - so what if he gets jealous.  It's not a healthy emotion and he needs to deal with it.<br>  Nina - So she thought she could do the ***** buddy thing but turns out she couldn't do it w/o getting emotionally attached.  She needs to take that experience as a lesson learned and not do it in the future.  Getting upset with Fred for doing nothing more than what they agreed to do is pointless.<br>  Fred - is a player, he's got Nina, he's going to get Lola, and a few years from now he'll have a few more under his belt.  Ppl will probably hate him for being so desirable but he needs to live his own life and will figure it out one way or the other.<br>  Lola - shouldn't let Dean or Nina's jealousies affect her decision.  If she wants to get with Fred then she should.  If it "ruins the group" then maybe they aren't the fast friends everyone thinks they are.  Dean can mess around with Lola and Nina with Fred but no one else is allowed to mess around or all of a sudden the group is "ruined"??  Not very mature or fair, if you ask me.<br>  <br>  Bottom line: sure, Lola should talk with her friends.  Communication is a great tool for getting all that fear, jealousy and other silliness out of the way.  She should tell Fred first, since he is the object of her desire.|`|Tw79BIbjaa	You are clearly Lola and yes, tell how you feel. You won't be able to hold it in forever, especially if you like him that much. But a little advise, beware of Dean. He still likes you, it's bull **** if he says he doesn't. If he didn't, he wouldn't care about Fred and you.|`|0LqslIMLaa	If Lola has no intention of going out with him, even if Lola has good reasons or not, then Lola has no reason to inform anyone at all who would be part of this social circle.|`|gFZaJUGjaa	I didnt read all of it but just ask this chick out damn.

0LqslIMLaa	Imagine you REALLY want to touch someone, you just want to caress their skin (not sexually) by touching her face, he can be as close to you as he can and is really caring for you, but this way he is on neutral ground, not going to any of the special areas. It means he likes you quite a lot. If your ready, he may be ready for more as well.|`|abpMkRREaa	awww.....i think that is so romantic. i remember when my now husband use t do that to me...enjoy it while it lasts honey, and also could u please go to my profile, and go to the last question i just asked and answer it for me it will be very appreciated. thanks in advance.|`|V7W2T7lGaa	It means he cares about you and doesn't want to rush in to anything and risk ruin the realtionship by moving to fast and placing his hands somewhere else|`|aZHAmaudaa	Your face is soft.....|`|TT43pWMlaa	He wants to take the chance to touch u.

I know I read in a book this one scene where the protagonist kisses this girl then brushes her cheek gently with his knuckles.  I then wanted to do that with a girl after I kissed her because it was stuck in my mind as a romantic thing to do because of the scene in the book.  Maybe he dreamt it, read it in a book, saw it in a movie or just thought it up while lying there or who knows???  I don't think it means anything like a sign that you should get married or that your firstborn child will become a painter or anything.|`|i7QJAgquaa	affection he really likes you for you if not he would be touching you in other places you know just to get what he wants if you know what i mean.... <br>  i would say he's a keeper for now|`|DCzSBPUjaa	He's madly in love with you.|`|2tBJT53Kaa	It don't mean a thing.

uJ9waJDYaa	Just give it a week so things smooth over a little bit.<br>  Yes, what happened is considered having sex so technically you did loose your virginity. Try to not worry about it, if you don't want to think of it as your first time then thats your decision. It may be kind of hard to push it out of your mind but if you really want to forget about it then hey no one has the right to tell you that you had sex and you need to remember that time as your first forever.<br>  After a week talk to him and ask him and tell him <br>  as a friend, do you actaully remeber anythign because I think we should just talk it over quickly so we can move past it. I think it would be better even if you have feelings for him to jsut stay friends, so try talk it out and i hope your friendship mends.<br>  <br>  I hope you find a good boyfriend in teh future you you love and loves you and you share that moment of having sex with that man for the first time, even if its not your 'real' first time.|`|TMk46Pfcaa	Guys are good at lying so don't believe him.

Especially when alcohol is involved. Even without alcohol lol.<br>  <br>  I think the alcohol clouded both you and your friend's judgment but now that it happened threes no use reliving it. You need to decide wether or not you want ,or more importantly can comfortably, continue to be friends with him. Its sounds like right now you can't so let him give you the space you need to do some serious thinking.<br>  <br>  Since you lost your virginity to him you may be feeling a little bit of attachment toward him...all I can say is that it will pass with time but the memory won't<br>  <br>  Good Luck :)..|`|j1XrPqNwaa	Hey don't worry it probably doesn't count so much.

Therefore intercourse is done. Doesnt matter it only gone through once or more . Move on and find someone you love.

I bet he remembers more than he's admitting to.  Men get real touchy if they think they were bad at sex, especially if it was with a girl they liked, and that may also be why he's avoiding you.|`|84be0d3fcba82930adcce6a09996c0ceaa	Well he didn't break your hymen, right? Probably not. So you don't have to act like he did. You are technically a virgin. He is a jerk- he knows what he did, he is just playing you.

I think you just need to forget about it. pretend it never happend. I know it's hard, but for someone as your best friend to pull something like that. He's not a friend at all. Look, i've been drunk a couple of times with many of my good friends. But I would never take advantage of them, i am someone who thinks it's unnecessary and wrong. A man doesn't wait for the women to say NO, or stop. or w8's till they get drunk. That just shows he's not a man at all. it also shows he don't have respect for the people that care about him, such as a good friend. Sorry, but let him go. If he doesn't give you the respect you deserve, then he doesn't need to be with you, as a friend or a boyfriend. Hey. Recite these words. "I am a virgin." Cuz to me, u r.
cOce5YbRaa	Best thing to do would be to talk to your Dad. If he doesn't help then you have a problem. I have 3 of the worst step-kids that could ever be alive. They all cuss at me and their Dad, have pushed and shoved us, hit us but mainly me. I have never once raised my voice at them or hit them. I have always tried to be their friend and wanted them to feel like they could come and talk to me about anything and everything and it was that way for a while but things changed because their Dad has a bad temper. I have talked to their Dad about what they do to me and he doesn't do anything about it at all. So, if your Dad doesn't help you, it totally reeks. I am fixing to kick out my so called husband and his 3 Demonic kids tomorrow. I have put up with this for nearly 4 years and they are all including their Dad totally destroying me mentally and physically. I wish you the best and hope your Dad helps you. If he doesn't it just isn't right at all.

3Sr2FgRfaa	Guys love having female friends. Who else can answer questions about crazy women? And if you're close to guys, you'll have them looking out for you too. Look at it as a little sister relationship, if you're having trouble understanding it.<br>  <br>  As for the girls and teachers who think you're headed for trouble -- what do you think? You know right and wrong, and you know better than they do what you have been doing and plan to do. Don't worry about any of them. They'll get over it.<br>  <br>  So yeah, go ahead and have guy friends as well as girl friends. They're some of the best friends you'll ever have, and later in life you'll be grateful for it.|`|u39lFgfuaa	Gosh, you talk about guys as if they're some other species or something. They're people too! Of course it's ok to have guy-friends! Jeez. They're wonderful! And it's only natural...<br>  <br>  Some of my best friends are guys. And they're very useful to go to for advice when you need a guy's perspective. They understand each other in a way that us girls never will be able to. :P|`|YAFl7Nc7aa	I don't see anything wrong with having male friends as long as you make it clear with them that you are friends not a problem..but maybe some of your female friends are a little jealous that you get on so well with the opposite sex.|`|rnBzVuytaa	it's cool to have friendds that are male man <br>  as long as you don't sleep with them or anything silly like that then it's cool|`|Jhpiy5lFaa	both, as long as your not sleeping with anyone of em your fine.|`|j2SVdhIsaa	there's nothing bad to have a guy friends as long as they are good influence to you.|`|AA10487905	It's definitely okay to have guys as your friends. They usually understand you and they don't stab your back as much as girls seem to do to each other when they're mad. I think they'll make good friends, to anyone. It's just that you have to pick the right friends that are guys to avoid getting hurt or anything else. I think you shouldn't care about what other people say because you get to choose your friends and it's you life that you're living. I agree with you on that front because I do believe that guys are better than girls. At least they're upfront if they have a problem with you. With girls, people gossip and tell rumors and they end up hurting you even more. Sometimes you just wish that they told you that they were mad at you in the first place, which is what I think guys usually do. I know it may be a bit stereotypical, but I think guys are usually like that... and that is just somehow better than girls...|`|Myt4vwTFaa	it's definitely good to try to be friends with everybody. getting along with all types of people is a good life skill. it's fine to hang out with boys. just make sure you are smart about it. make sure there are other people around when you hang out with boys. just as a precaution. the buildups game sounds kinda weird but when i was younger i played games like that too. of course now i'm kinda embarrassed by it but it was sorta fun.  having boys as friends is fine just make sure you pay attention to the type of guy friends you have. really you should pay attention to the type of friends you have. guy or girl they should support you, have good morals, not pressure you into anything, not make you feel inadequate, and just all around be good friends and good people. it's fine to be a tomboy or a girlie girl or a little of both. just be who you are. be someone you respect and don't worry if other people think you should be a little more girly or whatever.<br>  p.s. some people may make fun of you for being a good straight a student but just ignore them. they are just insecure and no matter what they say, being good is cool :)|`|N4L3Wkyxaa	Of course that it is OK to have male/female friendship relations,it is not wrong for you to hang out with guys..just don't become a guy yourself !:)) <br>  <br>  ...but I personaly don't have any close female friends..and I could never be just a friend with a girl if I liked her...so that can be a problem..if one of your friends fells in love with you and you don't like him back..your friendship May be over ...and the opposite is the same, if you would fall in love with a male friend and he doesn't feel the same way about you I really don't think that you would find it easy to hang out with him....so that is the part of male/female friendship that SUCKS!|`|usIUgISsaa	no ****.<br>  why do u care wat other people say?<br>  to say the truth, guys are better friends cuz they dont talk behind your back and stab ur back and call u a whore.<br>  maybe by trying to be more girly u shud date one of themm?<br>  anyways, i think you should just conttinue wat ur doing. guys can become rele good friends in the future and its not worth loosing for some stupid people.|`|vFaCeZGUaa	DUHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH<br>  JUST DONT GO F.U.K.!ng them<br>  <br>  geez|`|67115b1163cc8b9c69bf180fdf940ed7aa	there is nothing wrong with having guy friends, u should consider the guys you trust more your guy friends and the others that you don't spend time with or talk to as much as your class mates..<br>  <br>  U should also consider playing some girly games,and stuff.. or having slumber parties.. so u don't end up being such a tom-boy<br>  good luck|`|3b81d471c44135bcc3043a49eca775e2aa	ok.. first of all.. i m a guy.. and i ve tons of female friends.. (not girlfriends .. ) and 3 or 4 ..really close friends..<br>  wat is wrong with ppl getting close to each other what-so-ever their gender is.. ?? it's ur friends or (probably) the teacher who is wrong.. not YOU!! <br>  We like getting CLOSE with a friend of opposite sex (whom we can trust).. <br>  YOU R NOT WRONG!! that's for sure..<br>  :)|`|IgivEx1Vaa	No it's TABOO.....<br>  <br>  Of course girl ...it's normal having borfriend sfor girls. ..|`|xZjtsza1aa	SHHH
3RGqsE7Qaa	Ask him on a date and find out if there can be something more then the hot sex.  If not, then just consider him a good lay and maybe a friend.  You can't tell our emotional feelings from how we have sex accurately.  You definitely make him hot, but that's not the same thing as him having feelings for you.<br>  <br>  So ask him out, or just flirt with him to figure him out.  Please, don't turn it into something it's not.  Don't force a relationship.  You will just get hurt.|`|K0549f2Caa	That is some hot stuff. When you have the sexual attraction there is nothing holding you back.|`|h0ZdSxQiaa	if he is being selfish then he is not serious but if he still talks to you and hang out with you and being thoughtful then it could mean something more!!|`|lTsONvwQaa	NO! how it started and what happens after are key not what happens during.|`|84be0d3fcba82930adcce6a09996c0ceaa	No, not really. Guys look at hook ups as a way to get in a girl's pants especially if you did not know him previously. He has some good seducing skills, a guy really good at playing the field knows what girls like.<br>  You fell for it.<br>  It's okay because we all do.|`|6OepW21kaa	Did he ever compliment you? Did he actually have a convo with you? [not about sexual things] <br>  <br>  You can tell if a guy is really interested in YOU by how much he talks to u and wat he says..|`|66Fhsm0vaa	its hard to tell. alot of guys just want a hookup. but if he still talks to you and seems interested in your personality, asks you questions than it could be something more.|`|FS5F3Ryyaa	Have you heard from him since no well I think he was  testing the water and you should of played hard to get now you what know if he really likes you for you or just wants a bit|`|0LqslIMLaa	If you just hooked up this way, it probably means nothing. Ask him if he wants to be more, if he says no, then thats your answer.|`|Tw79BIbjaa	Usually when it's more, from my experience, there's alot of staring in each others eyes and smiling throughout...|`|u9Mc7ztmaa	Guys are ruled by their hormones, depends how old you are<br>  and if you want it to mean anything or not?|`|r8VlHM5Uaa	i think next time u spot someone get to know them first otherwise ur just gonna get used - i think he just wanted to "hook up"|`|qGT0oFDdaa	nupp he just wanted to **** u !|`|c99a5407fb7bfb892111f9e9314b6dcaaa	not to him but i think his fingers are happy.|`|bzquJ5uPaa	no. it's called physical chemistry.
AA12349214	Well, what I do know is that you cant make another person love you if they dont want to.  You have to have an open and frank discussion with him.  Ask him outright if he wants this other woman and not you and be prepared for the answer.  If it is negative and he doesnt want you then you have to be brave, accept it, deal with the heartache and make some informed decisions about where your life is going.  Do you want to stay in the country you moved to or move back to where you came from?  Do you want to stay - but maybe just move areas?  Do you want to stay and just make yourself a life there without him.  <br>  When someone we love leaves us we think it is the end of our life, the pain would seem as if it were never going to go - but it does - if we let it.  There has to be a grieving period and it may be that we never really get over that person - but we do move on and should move on.  <br>  You cannot do any of this until you have had these full and frank discussions with your partner and find out what went wrong and if it is salvageable.  If it isnt you are going to have to be very brave.<br>  But however much you love someone - if they dont love you back there is not much you can do about it.<br>  Dont let them walk away with their life and take yours with it.<br>  Live your own even if its without them.|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	Your first priority is to go to a counselor and find out why you feel the need to be with men who abuse you. You have zero self esteem and no feelings for yourself at all which is very dangerous and will leave you vulnerable to all kinds of freeloading men who will use you and dump you. You do NOT want him back, there is nothing there to go back to and you need to hire an attorney and get back every penny you spent, then get yourself in order because of you keep doing this same thing over and over again you will end up alone and poor.|`|1ZuF9FdSaa	people change.  he's obviously changed to the point where he does not feel compatible with you anymore.  It may be that in the future he will change again... or that you will change.. <br>  people are dynamic... it's no wonder that their relationships are dynamic as well... despite conventions such as "marriage" designed to lock a couple into a static arrangement.<br>  <br>  check out:<br>  <a href="http://www.xeromag.com/fvpoly.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.xeromag.com/fvpoly.html</a>|`|AA12351814	He isn't ready to settle down.  You need to move on and avoid any contact from him.  Absorb the money losses and get on with it.  I think you have lost him.|`|GTdcnGT6aa	Yes i've got some advice,as painful as it might be, if he loved you he would not see other women, talking things over is not the answer, it may last for a while and it happens all over again. sort out your affairs and get on with your life, don't let him see that you are bothered.a heart will mend and there is someone out there for you, you just haven't found him yet. love to you and good luck.|`|jaZazNzZaa	He obviously didn't put the same amount of emotion into your relationship as you did.  You gave him a "get out" clause and he took it, which have been the perfect opportunity for him to not move back in. I don't think there is any future in this relationship and wanting someone back desperately will not change his mind. I think you need a complete break from him and the country you are currently living in, which, I think, is why you are depressed.|`|venDHb2Gaa	It does not mean he has no feelings for you or does not love you, despite being with another woman. I should know I have just made the biggest mistake of my life a few months ago, cheating on my husband. I deeply regret what I did but cannot change it now. Sometimes people make mistakes.<br>  <br>  Maybe his is a mistake, maybe it is not, only time will tell. Maybe he is doing it because he thinks it is the quickest way to move on from the situation. If this is the case he is wrong and will regret it. <br>  <br>  I know it is really hard but try to move on with your life (without him) and time will tell if you guys are meant to be together. <br>  <br>  Think of him like a butterfly: If you love it let it free and it will come back if it is meant to be.<br>  <br>  Goodluck, you deserve happyness.

ne0EjucSaa	She will have to go to court if not a warrent will be out for her arrest. <br>  Tell your friend to talk with lawyers they will help her in ANY way possible. She can apply for a ss card at the office along with papers stating that shes in hte us from another country., I think ss does that not for sure. Um the worst thing that can happen to her jail time. and or many fines, probation or she might be going back to where she came from.|`|NqMmvvgVaa	If she is in the country illegally then that is a problem. There are ways to do it legally,a and she should have known better. If she already knew that she was here illegally, and on top of that she was silly enough to shoplift then she deserves to get deported.|`|wpi36XBAaa	If she's an illegal who committed a crime the chances of her being allowed to stay are minimal. Not attending court would be the worst thing she could do, as there would be a warrant for her arrest then.|`|GtBOQPKqaa	Shoplifting is a misdemeanor charge (sometimes classified as a disorderly persons offense), so she may be able to plead to a lesser charge, without prison time, though there may be a fine, restitution and/or probation involved.<br>  <br>  "Possibility" of going to court? For a crime like that, she WILL go to court.<br>  <br>  Having said that, once it is revealed she is here in this country illegally, her shoplifting charge will pale by comparison - being here illegally is a FEDERAL crime, and that will weigh more heavily.<br>  <br>  Her best bet will be to talk to an attorney - one can be provided to her, per the Miranda rights read to her at the time of her arrest - regarding her being "a good student" who "still wants to continue her education." However, I cannot make any guesses whether the federal judge will allow this; it would be up to him.<br>  <br>  The big question is whether she's here on a student visa, and whether it's expired and if so, for how long.<br>  <br>  Good luck to your friend.|`|9CMGO5fhaa	Doesn't she respect our Country? There are millions here illegally who go to work to BUY the stuff in the stores they don't steal it she just hurt our economy worse. If she is such a good student she would have been smart enough to not shoplift ya think? Worst case scenario, she already went to jail if a immigration hold was effective they would have found out about it. Otherwise don't say much else and she may receive probation and fines. Good luck to your friend hope she learned her lesson.|`|r9M63O7Xaa	shes probably going to get deported, that was kind of dum shoplifting especially when you have so much on the line if your not a citizen, umm that sucks cause she makes illegal immigrants look bad when there are so many hard working ones here in the US

Zf18VjlCaa	Wow, you have set your sights high.  Shouldn't be hard, seen as how most people online aren't looking for LTRs and just "friendly hookups"|`|Scctt6TXaa	Get out into the world, be a cocky person.  And talk to 10 cute girls a day.  Out of 10, you'll get 5 numbers.  One or two will be down to kick it with you.  And you score with the one that's the most inviting.  Remember.  I call this the 10-5-2-1 method.
Zf18VjlCaa	He loves you cos you support him, stop buying him things and paying for his car and he's gone... I feel so sorry for that child...  You know he will leave you if you don't buy him things.... you also strike me as the type that got intentionally pregnant to keep him.... gosh... your plan is about to back fire.....|`|dvQYaRNDaa	He loves your money and not you. End of story. <br>  <br>  He will never love a pushover. Having his baby is a big mistake.|`|AA12349214	Gosh, there's no accounting for love is there?  Honey, if it aint right now its never going to be.  And stop bailing him out with money - you arent helping him just aiding him in his dependency on your money.<br>  Why do people ever think a baby is going to make things better?|`|XGgPhaDbaa	Honey, you can't buy someones love. He may very well be using you to get things that he can't afford. But on the other hand, you say he tells you out of the blue that he loves you. Maybe he is tired of you constantly asking him if he loves you. Men don't really like that.<br>  I know that I would have an issue with it and I'm female.<br>  If you really want to know if he loves you, stop spending your money on him.|`|EtUkys6Waa	Sometimes actions speak louder than words.  Does he treat you well? Does he work and pay his fair share?  I'd tell you to back off of him and see what his reaction is, but you don't sound that strong.  Grow a spine!!! your baby is gonna need you more than he is,  are you ready for that???  Seriously, find an outside support system, friends, family, church, lean on these people who care about you and do not make the mistake of making this man the center of your universe.  He may not be ready for that.  Good luck.|`|5oBjmeJMaa	you made a HUGE mistake! why did you even love him from the beginning it's totally obvious that he doesn't! and will never do, now the Baby is the problem!! he needs a father u know?! you put yourself into this! so you gotta deal with it! stop buying things for that jerk, and you'll see how he'll be gone, he doesn't deserve it!|`|FS5F3Ryyaa	He likes your bank account if he tells you he don't love you why are you still holding on  you need to stand up and be counted as a person if you want him to respect you move on and let him know your not going to put up with this I don't blame him I blame you he has been honest to you your just not listening your hopeing and trying to buy his love its not going to work he doesn't have to make a commitment to you because you accept is lack of love move on  and see if he misses you|`|AA10898603	Oh he loves you.... he just is have a hard time admiting it to himself that he has those types of feels.... the only thing you can do is let him know you love him. Next time he pushes you away just tell him I'm still gonna be here loving you even if you're not here loving me back... I love you even if you don't love yourself. And let it be. don't force nothing or push the subject.|`|2tBJT53Kaa	Hate to say that your a sucker in a big way!<br>  If he loves you, you wouldn't have to ask if he does!<br>  He would be making plans to take care of you and the baby.<br>  You have to make a hard decision.<br>  To keep the baby or not.<br>  Stay away from this guy!  He is a total loser!|`|33ff7896e21262632a7a84d1edc78dc5aa	Find your self-esteem and stop paying for love.  Is this really something that you want to teach a child, that you're worth nothing on your own?  Everyone deserves to find a relationship where they can be loved for who they are not how much money they have or the presents they'll give.|`|AA10415277	it is better to have someone say those words to you when they are real.  i don't think that you would rather him say them to you and not mean them.  sometimes it just takes longer for us guys to come around.  i don't say the word unless there is no doubt....going on 5 years now.lol|`|u9GQRbhvaa	I'm sorry, but you are so stupid...you're having a baby and yet you're supporting some dumb@ss ? wow, grow up..what's gonna happen when your baby needs support, you're going to be begging your lame to help out ? heh, he'll be with his next sugar mama.|`|eyxPlJF1aa	sounds like hes using you.. you desrve someone who loves you just as much as you love him..not someone who says thank u when u say i love u.|`|q34jUwQBaa	i did this to my ex, i hated him. he might hate you too.|`|8jv2Y44haa	This may not necessarily be an indicator that he will leave you in the future.  But keep in mind that a person can say, "I love you" all day long and leave....  Some questions you may want to ask yourself and get the answers to are  (1.) What kind of love is it? (2.) What does love mean to them and to me? (3.) How do they express love? (4.) How do I want love expressed to me?  And (5.) Is this the kind of 'love' I want and desire?” <br>  <br>  What this indicate to me is that you may not necessarily "Love" yourself as much as you should.  With a baby on the way, I would recommend that you spend some time finding out why you may not love yourself as much as you "may" love another.  Then I would recommend you work on loving yourself, like you would like another person to love you.  Better yet, "Love" yourself like God Loves you.  I think you and your baby desired this and the answers to the above questions.|`|F7em2vRIaa	He is an *** and he's using you for your money. When you tell him that you love him and all he can say is thank you he doesn't really care about you he only care's about your money. He probably tell's you I love you once in a while so you'll keep taking care of him and giving him money. I know it hurt's but you need to dump him. There's someone out there for you that will treat you good and love you back, and that won't ask you for money like that. I'm guessing that he's never paid you back the money that he owes you either. Just get rid of this guy he's no good. And having a baby with a guy is not going to make him stay with you. alot of girl's think that if you have a baby it will make a guy love you or stay with  you but that's not true at all. He sound's like a jerk.|`|vsNyENH3aa	Rachel this is unacceptable. If you are with him especially in something as serious as raising a child together h should not only respect you but love you and put you before anything or anyone else. The fact that he doesnt respond when you ask him if he loves you is just unacceptable. I dont know your situation nd this may sound very difficult but you need to talk to him By the sounds of it you dont have much self esteem and you need to build that back up. You need to confront him and say look, I love you and a I want this child to have a loveing respected father who is a role model. If he does'nt provide this maybe you should re-evaluate your sitiuation ie. leave him. You've got to remember its not just about you anymore, its about a your little blessing growing inside you and what is the best for her/him. Maybe he needs some time to re-think what he wants in his life. You need to talk about it. Goodluck xo

hBRJAQddaa	wow love conflict in grade 7 that is cute, okay back to the topic first of when he messaged you that he likes another girl it was what we call a jealousy call, he wanted to see your real feelings, but he fell down when you replied saying you are happy with his decision. <br>  <br>  Second at least on scale he said more than 5, some people even say 2 so it means you are in safe grounds.<br>  <br>  And lastly if u really like him then you should know something about him like his favorite color(you can tell by seeing which color he wears most) and talk to him nicely, do not stick on him, and just bake him cookies or something(have an adult to supervise you) , invite for study session with some friends (show him your good points) and good luck ;D|`|I0TJERspaa	May be, he is not the right man you should go for .Emotional involvement with that guy should be avoided.<br>  best wishes.......|`|F6p5R8hxaa	Uhhh, that was a bad idea that you told him you liked someone else.<br>  That probably just pushed him away already & that's what probably caused him to tell you that he's into someone a bit more.<br>  <br>  I mean if he had the guts to tell you how he felt about you, why shouldn't you? <br>  <br>  Tell him.<br>  <br>  "I'm sorry, I was caught off guard when you asked who I liked so I ended up saying I liked someone else.

Then it's not going to be true love. He should not scale you on 1-10. if so, his response to that should of been." Theres not a number big enough to show how much i love you/ or like you" either one. Look, i'm just a new yorker boy, but hey, it'll never be true love. u should move on, but it's up to you.|`|AA10898603	Probly not mature enought to realize what he likes...<br>  <br>  You don't... you let him make up his own mind...<br>  <br>  No, keep him in your heart always... and just let him be if its meant to be then he'll come around.<br>  <br>  6.5 is great!|`|qfkK4S66aa	Hah, of course he doesn't like you!|`|Wgg0xLQIaa	omg that's so confusing.<br>  <br>  u should just tell him how u feel.
8AaJI62Eaa	see chatting for hours and hanging out together means that u both like each other and are comfortable with each other bcoz we don't do the things or meet persons whom we don't like kk<br>  <br>  and abt asking her let first find wht she is having ur image in her mind through a common friend and then go ahead|`|CY5ADI0baa	i thinking that you should try finding out if she likes you the way you like her BEFORE asking her out.<br>  if she doesn't like you, don't ask her out because that will definitely make things awkward between you guys.<br>  and if she does like you and i decide to ask her out, just say how you really feel to her. like maybe tell her how much you like her, and that you feel comfortable around her and can tell her anything...|`|gPKvD6bcaa	i did the same, but our friendship is still intact, actually she loved me later only she told that n' after proposing her she doesn't talked to me for months n' later 1 n' half year i fall in love with other gal, she got angry n' told that she loved me n' all that happend coz of her parents, so try to give few hints to her during the chatting or messages from her replies u can read b/w the lines lol :)|`|TdT9nFfGaa	spit in her eye<br>  <br>  lols, nah just ask her out DUHHHHH! just be like " bla bla,  (insert her name here)...I like you, will you go out with me? if not..its okay, just forget i said anything"<br>  <br>  <br>  haha i just turned 13 today|`|uscHnFPtaa	there is a song I want you to look up, its called "that's the way" its by Led Zeppelin, <br>  <br>  I had the same thing happen to me, my best friend of almost 3 years (my guy friend of course) came out and told me recently that he was in love with me, I was completely shocked.. I ignored him for weeks, and then sent him the lyrics to that song (which you should look up) now, our friendship in one word would be defined as awkward. I wish he never told me that. On the other hand.. if she does like you, I would tottally go for it.. thats cute. But you should maybe talk to one of her friends first and see if she like's you more than a friend, and if so then go from there, Im not saying you will ruin your friendship by telling her you like her, Im just simply saying sometimes things are better left the way they are|`|qfkK4S66aa	Yes, she can make you sandwiches. Its delicious.
PYZ3APQDaa	sometimes people don't like to deal with long distance friendships. i have really close friends that i still love that live in different parts of the world that i have fell out of contact with not because i don't want them to be my friend but because life just keeps moving on. you get busy with work, family, hobbies. i know that doesn't sound like a good excuse to ditch a friend and it's not but alot of times people just get busy busy busy! leave her one last message and tell her that it is very important that she get in touch with you and when she does if she does just ask her straight out what is going on with your friendship.|`|dvQYaRNDaa	When a friend ignores you that means they just don't want to talk to you any longer.

I know how you feel, but it doesn't help. Start fast and start now.
AA11150213	You never stated what the problem is, it just sounds like you venting.<br>  <br>  Anyhow it honestly seems like you are too involved. As step mother you want to embrace his children no doubt, but you can't be the one telling them what to do, your husband needs to step up and do that. <br>  I kept hearing you say she's charging us child support, child support is something your husband needs to pay, he made the children so  why should you have to worry about that, that should be between him and his ex-wife.<br>  <br>  I can't believe you worked 7 days a week throughout your pregnancy. That is really tough. Your husband had those 6 children and he needs to step up and support them, it's not fair for you to be stressing about these things.
iPNOVR6Gaa	He is not stringing you along, and you are doing yourself a serious disservice by telling yourself he is.  You are the mother of his child and he wants to know you're OK - that's it.  Stop trying to read things into it.  He is with the woman he's with because he wants to be with her.  You are divorced - no other reason matters.  Who he dates is well and truly none of your business, as long as he keeps up good boundaries for your child in that matter.  You're divorced - act like it!|`|bO2rzfISaa	What a crock. You know he's got another woman and you let him treat you emotionally. STOP. Pay attention to his actions, not his high school texts.|`|y4SUDnpaaa	I think his phone calls are nothing more than what a friend would do. He probably feels guilty because  he asked for the divorce,  because you told him how devastating it was to you knowing his was with this other person and  because  you begged him him to work things out. I'm not saying you were wrong in staying those things but it makes it understandable for him to keep checking in with you to be sure you're all right.You aren't suicidal, I hope. Committing suicide is cowardly and selfish. You would be leaving behind a 4 year old with no mother and condemning her to a life wondering why her mother chose to leave her. You shouldn't be suffering this way. I suggest you go to a therapist for help in getting your life back to normal. It wouldn't be a bad idea to see a psychiatrist to get some meds for depression. I know if you could stop feeling this way on your own you would do it, you need help. You should also look  for a support group for divorced women. You owe it to your daughter to pursue every avenue. Your sadness and hurt are affecting her too.|`|AA10500537	just admit it its over and go on with your life .<br>  try changing   your location  maybe you could move where you don;t see him often|`|040115101fd4e24b2fd4488f18b7a9c9aa	You need to move on by doing things like going out with friends, treat yourself to a make-over if you can afford it, get involved with something to occupy your time, whether a bowling league, simply taking your daughter to do things,or even get involved in activities in a church if you attend one.  you have to make sure that you don't get involved with someone else just to fill a void in your life but build up you confidence in  yourself first, move on, and you will find someone else more interested in you than some young chick!!|`|9CMGO5fhaa	Just do what you gotta do girl be strong for the baby and let him have what he wants.

cn04Dmzeaa	Don't play the jealous girl and bring the concerns to your man, there's no need to be confrontational, bring it up nonchalantly but be firm, don't let him blow off the topic.<br>  <br>  Also during your analysis of the situation, ask yourself:<br>  -Do you know she still likes him?<br>  -Does he know she still likes him?<br>  -Does he still like her?<br>  -Does her boyfriend know she's hanging out with him all the time?<br>  <br>  <br>  By the way, what are you doing dating your friend's ex?

There is no point in hanging on to a relationship that is patently over so do him and yourself a favour and just tell him.<br>  You dont have to hurt him, but being upfront in the long run will be for the best.<br>  If you can stand to have him as a friend then offer him that, tell him you dont hate him but need time to do things with your girlfriends.<br>  Whatever you say is going to be hard for you so I guess you need to put things into your own words, if he is in love with you there is nothing you can do to soften it.<br>  Dont carry on in a relationship because you are scared of upsetting him but be diplomatic and let him move on too.<br>  Good luck.|`|m2eHPeciaa	spend some time away from him n see if ur feelings change. if they dont, then slowly stop seeing him, then tell him its not gonna work out b/c u jus dont feel the love for him ne more. n thats it.|`|vRc7ktcsaa	"i don't love you anymore. i'm breaking up with you already."<br>  <br>  ~ and it all ends in a happy ending.|`|suxunLtLaa	tell him that , <br>  now u r not so much romantic or attractive or anything else than before , <br>  & that's what i like in men|`|4T8RTnzCaa	You should just be truthful.....................!!!|`|URBdbHP1aa	I think this one is hard because all though the love isnt there as much anymore, you still care and so want to save their feelings. I think the best thing to do is being honest. It's a bigger slap in the face to live in a lie and allow them to think that their relationship is safe. You need to sit down, in a non-romatic setting, and talk about it. Make him aware that it's not that you dont care, its just that you dont feel the same as you used to and it worry's you. He may understand and decide that the best way forward is a break. You can only be honest with yourself and him to discover the best solution. Good luck.|`|9MSIdKnWaa	yea i just did this too it sucks. me and my ex dated for 3 years then i told her i didn't feel the same way anymore.

He'll definetly leave the bad habit for their sake.|`|IRp9ntbzaa	You might not appreciate someone so young answering this (I'm 19) but this is something I've certainly been through.  I have learnt that you cannot make an alcoholic stop drinking.  Threat's don't work (in most cases at least).  They need to want to change for themselves and realise there is a problem.  <br>  <br>  Let me try and explain using my personal example.  My mother has been an alcoholic all my life.  Verbally abusive (and sometimes physically) when drunk, but as far as people outside the family are concerned the loveliest person in the world.  It has badly affected me all my life, I was diagnosed with depression at 12, been through 11 counsellors/pyschiatrists and basically had no childhood.  My father would not try and stop her drinking and its got to the point that I have no relationship with her and can't forgive her.  I gave her an ultimatum a few weeks ago that she wouldn't see me again if she didn't stop drinking.  She "admitted" to having a problem, but will not stop drinking.  She thought admitting it would be enough.  So ultimatums don't work.  <br>  <br>  It can have a terrible affect on families, on the children and the spouse.  They call it a family disease because of that.  One way if you are really serious about trying to get him to stop would be to use an intervention.  I've never had enough people willing to help me so never been able to try it, but if there are enough people that care about your husband, maybe that would be something to try.<br>  <br>  I hope you don't mind how I tried to explain all this, but I just don't think people realise sometimes how much it can affect the kids in the family and things.<br>  <br>  Theres some great info on the net also......if u havent found any, I could try help point ya in the right direction if u wanted...|`|crZZMhnnaa	Well..even my dad was very fond of alcohol and drinks everyday. One day my friend's father died because of consuming so much of alcohol after his death the family left helpless...my father changed little bit after this incident and started consuming less alcohol.<br>  <br>  You better talk to your husband and tell him everything clearly whatevr u feel and ask him to consume alcohol only on particular days like twice in a week but dont tell this when he is drinking.<br>  <br>  Even then if he dont listens to you..... be away from him for quite some days and make him realize how life is difficult without you..<br>  <br>  Bye for now and take care.|`|y3n0Ql6Paa	Wow, I wish there was a magic answer.  Unfortunately, nobody can make him quit if he doesn't want to.  Believe me, I have tried.  I have finally come to the realization that I have two options, 1. leave or 2. stay...that's it...I can only control my response to it...nothing else.  So for now, I think you need to consider whether the good is better than the bad...<br>  <br>  I will say that once we had this issue with too much alcohol, the darn thing wasn't working and I told my husband that I thought that was causing it...and kind of made fun of the fact it wasn't working...For the most part, he's not drinking as often...I did praise him lots when he didn't drink and the thing worked...hehe...

What nerve!|`|AA11831230	ok, first off, what business is it of your cousin's to tell people that you're a virgin.  she has no right to tell private things about you to other people, especially guys you haven't even seen and don't even know.  you should be livid with her...i knowi would be if my cousin gave away very private information like that.<br>  <br>  furthermore, i think it's great that you're still a virgin.  most women aren't at your age.  they're sleeping with every bf they're dating.  it's a matter of will power.  those girls will say no to random people or hook ups but not to their bf's advances.  so you stay a virgin and wait for the right guy to come along, better yet, wait until marriage.  that would be the ultimate gift to a husband because it shows love.<br>  <br>  i hope i helped.  srry about dumping on your cousin though, lol.|`|2kYNhrWSaa	If it irks you so much then shrug the title off.  Don't even answer if someone asks and give your friend a hard sharp poke in the side and tell her not to set you up as "the virgin" from now on (do it jokingly).<br>  <br>  At the 20 age range men are still quite immature in general (i'm 23, I know what i'm talking about), there is pressure on men to treat virginity as a conquest.  It's not right but it's what society puts on young men and they each deal with it differently.<br>  <br>  Anyways, good luck in finding the right person.|`|368a65d0c864e9d2efce27cfa3ebd33baa	I always thought having been the first to sleep with a virgin was a very special thing and since we are married I want to be the last one too :-)<br>  Now am going to have to buy Hooters trading cards to see what the <br>  stats are listed on them :-)<br>  There is no reason a single person needs to stop being a virgin|`|WHvWcrfAaa	comon loosin a virginity is a great thing, securing it a special and one should feel proud to be special..getin laid is as easy as having a cup of coffee, no emotions, no love just fulfilling the thirst...if u really wana make it special, u need to wait for the special guy, special moment and everything has to be SPECIAL. Virginity is like a life u will have it only once so don't keep ur head stright and walk with pride coz this special lady needs a special Man, who must be caring loving and who understands and respects this special lady..not any tom dick or harry.. well if u rn't desperate then y do u bother, give every1 a chill pill and u relax dear..i remember each and every moment of mine and feel soo gr8 it was worth ..trust me its gona worth for u too...
auOBJNEGaa	Well of course she's shy! She's being plunked into a room with a bunch of strangers. Take her, with you, to meet them all individually before you have another big group setting.|`|NTM822AZaa	this may take time, time is what you have plenty off, dont rush it, she trusts you, be happy with that, all will work out.
UA2F9STWaa	Dude take this advice if it's the last thing you do never I mean NEVER message a girl you like her I got shot down hard because I did that.It's way to impersonal.Tell her to her face.It's your best bet good luck|`|RoyvUWl7aa	awe..if i was a girl and I liked you , you should bring up the topic in person...i'm sure she'd be happy|`|c6NtUFECaa	thats so cute awww<br>  but u should do it over the phone <br>  and u did a wanderful job at getting her out of her fear <br>  i would have felt confident if i was with u <br>  casue thats just adorable<br>  but yea ask her out again<br>  im sure she will say yes
f3SyOyMEaa	Well, it sounds like you have done the right thing. He didn't keep his part of the deal about telling each other everything. That kind of tells you a little bit about his character, no matter what his reasoning for his behavior toward you is. You shouldn't have to deal with that, and it shows that you can't really depend on him to keep his word.|`|szVvf7Nkaa	I have a feeling that this guy is upset at you because you moved on. It was not fair to you that he didn't tell you that he was going back with his ex. But I honestly believe that he didn't think you were going to start dating. There are two things that you can do. You can talk to him and ask him why he's treating you this way. And try to find out what is really going on with him. Or just forget you ever met him. You also need to remind you that he still has issues that are not resolved where is ex is concerned. So maybe it would be best if you moved on without getting involved with him again.
1poSSvTdaa	Just buy what you want and ignore the rest. There are adverts about washing powder everywhere but they don't bother you. So keep calm, but complain if they are rude, or offensive.|`|PwHQSAxvaa	Where are they? I want to see!|`|ZzEAc5ecaa	well your right .. but why care anyway .. if you dont like it move out of the city . your in .. ok|`|PD1fZV7Aaa	Yes actually, it is frustrating to me. just the other night I was sitting watching TV with my 10 year old daughter and 3 year old daughter and this stupid Sex commercial came on with youth pretending to talk with parents about sex. Every other world out of the youths mouth was the world SEX. I didn't catch it fast enough to MUTE it and my little 3 yr old was repeating the word SEX randomly. I was PISSED that such a commercial would be on so early in the evening. Im sure there could have been a better way to get there point across. It just seems to be every where and Family's are struggling to teach there children Right and wrong and morels anymore.|`|e7zXr9ozaa	I don't pay much attention to it. The advertising world hates me because I truly am blind and oblivious to most of it. I buy what I like.|`|kHRD7uUAaa	no it doesn't bother me i take it you are not getting any lately|`|ZaO65qpBaa	Frustrating, yes. Objectifies women. And how do you explain stuff to your kids when they see that sort of thing. Very frustrating, but it is everywhere, so just ignore it and don't fall for the scam.|`|UQft205Waa	download spybot and firefox with addon called adblock plus<br>  problem solved|`|FzFSzilmaa	try not taking any notice...<br>  <br>  just live your life and choose places where these ads aren't...<br>  <br>  though i don't remember seeing ads for sex or porn anywhere... stay off sex aid websites... :D|`|n2mumPsYaa	Won't work.. Urban Legend|`|09k5GLLkaa	Pay no mind to it all. <br>  Concentrate on your own life.|`|4bedkpvLaa	no I think its great freedom of speech freedom of expression my baby girl. ya baby|`|SGreWjXaaa	It's gonna be here forever, I suggest you learn to ignore it.<br>  <br>  It'll be much easier then trying to get rid of them.|`|uHxfAyjBaa	I just get it for free!|`|RPYS9HjRaa	I agree that it is somewhat annoying. <br>  <br>  I thought fairly differently before my wife and I had two girls which seem to be overwhelmed by society's beliefs of what is acceptable. I am dreading the day that one of them comes home with an article of clothing that says something like "sexy" on it... but it will inevitably happen!<br>  <br>  Anyway, realistically there is nothing I can do about it... teach my kids the right way (they are directly under my influence) but otherwise learn to deal with what I can't control.|`|AA10980692	I ignore them. I don't like being marketed to as an object. A company that promotes their products with sex or by trying to make their customers feel bad about themselves, thus feeling better by using the product being promoted isn't worth my time and doesn't deserve my money.|`|VNkEthJRaa	Ignore it to the best of your ability. If can't think of something happy, that ever happened to you. This is how the world is, no use in trying to change it.|`|aCDucMOqaa	Naw, Its how the companies make their money. Off of retards who buy it. Just ignore it|`|XW1Fr9i6aa	yes it frustrates me. I just think of Jesus and turn my head picture jesus and the little children.
1poSSvTdaa	You needed to tell him his behaviour was fowl.|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	What an idiot, the thighs are much more flavorful than the breast which is very bland and he needs to cook his own meals from now on so that way he can't complain any more. I would refuse to cook for him any more. He can make a sandwich or heat up frozen food or go to McDonald's. He's an asshole.|`|RC8Pxx8eaa	Hurt, disillusioned and determined never to cook special things for him again. What a pig I hope you show him this and all the answers as I cant imagine any being on the side of your "husband".<br>  Beans on toast from now on...|`|rLsphyqhaa	I would be rather upset. I am a little mystified on how he does not cook yet could tel it was thighs over breast. they are about he same as in white meat but do have a little different texture to them. I use breast mostly when making yakisoba the family loves it. I have used things just not very often because the breast comes in a package I can work with. Like may others I would just let him fix his own meal a few time and see how he likes it. Get a few of those noodles in a cup. All he has to do is heat some water soak them in it and enjoy. After a few of those he would sure like a curry meal made from thighs.|`|IPS3hWweaa	I would be inclined to think he is completely unreasonable. That just doesn't make any sense to be upset about what kind of chicken pieces were used to make the dish. And then to not even recognize your effort you put into cooking for him, its a sad shame. He needs to wake up and appreciate you and the effort you put in.|`|W8aiAWe2aa	I would be as cross and hurt as you are.<br>  I would have made a point of scraping it into the bin and then saying "make your own meal then" and then gone upstairs for a nice long soak int the bath.<br>  <br>  the leg and thigh meat is said to be the tastiest part of the chicken. Sounds like he is just too fussy for his own good.<br>  <br>  Never let him talk down to you or start insulting your meals. If he does then don;t cook for him. He will soon learn.|`|u33x2hqzaa	I'd be hurt & angry at him.  However, people sometimes do stupid & reactionary things.  If he loves you & tries his best, then try your best to forgive him.  I'd let him know what you thought of his outburst if you haven't already.  I'd also start insisting he learn to cook & contribute to the preparation of the meals.  If he doesn't like what you cook, he can make dinner himself and he should help out anyway.  Sometimes you gotta lay down the law & live thru an argument to set down boundaries & maintain respect.  Otherwise chicken thighs will end up being grounds for divorce.  Don't let the relatively small become big by avoiding a problem in the marriage and all marriages have them.   Good luck!|`|b82ybE3gaa	If my husband did that I would be terribly upset, in no way did you deserve that. He was really unkind to you, and you shouldn't have to deal with that.<br>  <br>  Now if this was a one time deal. I'd tell him straight up that if it happens again I won't cook.<br>  <br>  If it happens frequently, I would just stop cooking and find out what his real problem was.|`|C3sqTngtaa	tell him to f**k off and cook for himself next time! do you know i really hate it when women put up with this - a relationship is a partnership therefore you should share responsibilties! i supposed you just took it? im not having a go, but that is a form of abuse and you need to talk to him about it!<br>  <br>  He cant cook, because you do it for him! buy him a book and go away for a week, i bet he'd suddenly learn to do something!|`|1b99e2172d8e187dc1c01f1f61578326aa	A bit worthless. Tell him you are upset by his insensitive behaviour. And he should cook for you if he's not happy with your efforts. And broaden his mind and experience new things.<br>  <br>  Hugs for you honey!<br>  <br>  Edit<br>  *****<br>  Hey - if he can't cook, then he'd soon need to learn if you went on strike.  Explain the word 'partnership' to him. You aren't a doormat.|`|d89qNyb6aa	He would have been wearing it and I would have been telling him what a tosser he looks in it.<br>  Seriously though,I would have been REALLY upset and would refuse to cook for him for a while.I would just cook for myself for about 3 days and see how he gets on.|`|I6KKFwxXaa	OMG so had that happen with ex that was first sign he could become violent. I beat him to the punch not literally but I threw food away and then broke all the dishes in the house served him bologna sandwiches for a week he got over it real quick LOL most fun I had with him.|`|Cb4vZuIDaa	ughh my bf is kinda like that when he doesnt have his way.i tell him you cook me something then! or grow the **** up its just dinner. usually something like that but thats just us! i dont advise for you to do this but im sorry to here that hope you feel better and that your husband comes to his senses and apologizes.mines always does.|`|kHRD7uUAaa	i love the legs and thighs of the chicken much better the the dry breast meat so if he won't eat it then you can cook it for me|`|AA10107400	I don't really like chicken thighs but if they are in a curry then they are fine and I will eat them. <br>  <br>  I would think that if your usually loving and caring husband has behaved in this manner then something is bithering him and it's nothing to do with chicken thighs. I know you must be very upset as he didn't behave in a very grown up manner but ask him what's the matter. I think you will find that he'll be very ashamed of his behaviour and be very sorry. <br>  <br>  If however he was just throwing a tantrum and being childish I would stab him with the knife I used to cut the chicken thighs!!! I would tell him right before this that in these economic times thighs are much mor economical and taste just as good as breast. I would also point out to him that he'll be getting no more of any kind of breast and that if he wants a curry in future he can buy it himself or get his mother to make it cos that's where he'll be living!!!<br>  <br>  You do a damn good job with your kids and your house DO NOT let a silly man's tantrum get you down!!!|`|AA11330115	I would look him straight in the eye and tell him what I tell my kids..."This is dinner. If you don't want to eat, then go hungry."...my husband has a bad habit of picking at the little things...example, I spend all day cleaning up the house and he comes home and says..."Oh it looks nice....but why didn't you do this?", or "you forgot to do that"....makes me so MAD! I tell him to do it himself next time, then it all gets done and nothing is forgotten.|`|y1BjjH10aa	sounds like domestic violence to me - I'm not kidding<br>  <br>  Domestic violence starts with this sort of stuff and builds up. Before you realise you are putting up with belitteling, intimidation and actual physical threats and violence itself. <br>  <br>  Okay he may have had a bad day but his reaction is out of all proportion to what happened - the situation is about control. <br>  <br>  If it's not a one off and things like this keep happening he needs help. If he doesn't see that he does or refuses to get help - cut your loses and find somebody else. <br>  <br>  If he doesn't want to change for the sake of your relationship then it's not a relationship worth staying in. You deserve better than this.|`|kBRKu0MAaa	Honestly? I would just calmly take the dinner off him, say 'oh you don't want it? That's fine' and put it in the bin but not offer to make him anything else. <br>  <br>  And then tonight, i would cook something really nice for yourself but not do him anything and when he says 'wheres mine?' just pretend like you're really surprised and say 'oh sorry honey, i didn't think my cooking was good enough for you, so i thought it would be best to let you make your own tea from now on'.<br>  <br>  That should show him ungrateful pig!!|`|ITHyHVSPaa	I would have cooked chicken thighs for the next bl00dy week or so then when the atmospheres  getting out of hand, created a new dish called 'pigs ***' and on the night i served it to him, suggest we make love after wards then stop abruptly short of his big O and complain 'I cant eat that - its disgraceful' then lmao and fall asleep|`|8d79a4e1999cf914bedfcbe3074786e0aa	If my hubby did that... it would be the last time i cooked for him for a very long time... till be gave me an honest and damn good apology.<br>  <br>  it do not matter if he didn't like it he didn't have to be so hurtful and rude he could have easily tried it and said... that he would have preferred you to use chicken breast.|`|5IJO3bzpaa	i agree with everyones answers here so far, i would say the battle is on! I have to say i am sorry you married the SOB. Personally (i am a professional cook so no man that cant cook better not say anything my kitchen) if my man said that to me he would be Hurting, bad. He owes you the world and until he treats u like a QUEEN.. make him alpo sandwiches grilled to perfection bc he is in the dog house!!!! <br>  <br>  Good Luck to you! <br>  P.s - I bet your dinner was fabulous, sorry he ruined it for you. There is nothing wrong with chicken thighs..slap him for me.. go cook for your friends and family , he doesn't deserve it.|`|651e1ee6ad591c873f721e0ec3f034b2aa	I can't cook either but anyone can take recipes from the internet and follow them if they can be bothered.  That's what my husband would be doing until he had groveled himself silly.  Make sure you keep him well in check or you will get that sort of treatment in all fields where you don't serve him to his liking.|`|NMTVIJrYaa	HI<br>  What an *** h**e, And you say he cant cook, how old is he? Tell him to make his own dam dinner. Guys like this do my nut and need lessons on how to treat there wife's etc<br>  If I did that I no for a fact the dinner would have been over my head and would be the last meal my wife cooked. <br>  You need to speak to him tell him how you felt when he did this to you. And put the question to him How would you feel?<br>  Needs his *** kicked<br>  Good Luck<br>  ps I have nice single friens (only joking)|`|07xi6IOSaa	i would tell him how hurt and unappreciated i felt and let him know that the way he behaved was so wrong and that all he had to do was say it in a better way. i would let him know that if i continued to be treated in that way, then he would become the one to cook the meals. period.|`|8938823b93c7a8fab3771af7c8ebf1e7aa	I would have taken that lovingly prepared curry and poured it over his stupid head.<br>  <br>  Give him beans on toast for the next two weeks.  By the end of it he will be begging you to make that curry again!!<br>  <br>  Who's the A*hole giving all the thumbs down??  Another male chauvanist pig no doubt|`|sYJuZtX0aa	offended!<br>  if you take your time to prepare something for you and him he should value and respect that and be thankful.<br>  tell him to do it himself.<br>  and has he ever expressed the fact that he doesn't like thighs?<br>  if not, ask him why the change?|`|HYrRkTjQaa	i would just never bother to cook dinner again. whats wrong with chicken thigh? i prefer it to breast, its more moist :) yummy :). he should be grateful he gets freshly cooked meals instead of microwave meals lol. i would feel so grateful if my bf cooked me a curry from scratch. they take ages to make :) xx|`|2Ccfsy9Maa	Is there some reason he can't eat thighs? I would probably be upset due to the amount of effort I had put into it. I think anger, hurt and righteous indignation would be my feelings. Hope you ate it, hope it was good and his loss.|`|Cfja6h4Kaa	I probably would cook yummy meals for one for at least a week. If my hubby asked where his was, I'd pull out the bread and peanut butter.<br>  <br>  Even if he only likes white meat, there's no reason to be nasty like that! Shame on him!|`|dUwl7Gn0aa	that's kinda scary lol, he sounds like hes one argument away from exploding. Like that film "falling down" where micheal douglas goes into mcdonalds with an ak47 and goes mad because the burger dosant look like the one on the pictures
r3O9XCSBaa	I am an Atheist too. It sounds like you are in a pretty big jam right now and your father is not making it any better. Have you talked to your guidance councilor about what has been going on? Don't be afraid to talk to someone at school and see if they can help you. Maybe they can give you a break you your work or maybe give you a tutor for a little while. Don't give up, things will get better just keep moving forward.|`|DUjr9tNUaa	Watch the movie Scarface....you can get ideas off that.|`|sNiC4rDUaa	everything is going to be OK,  don't worry|`|HM3pWPMoaa	i'm not a dad but i seen this with guys b4 ,i'll tell u it's sad to see it but u gotta get priorities in line for school as for your mom she's doin best she can for u,yes u r loosing out but most of all though u got your mom who is there for u as your dad he's a deadbeat father.we call them that who don't support there family. i just know when i have kids i'll do the right thing..so don't loose hope in school or with your mom|`|OyBuEpOTaa	You don't need him. just cut back in unnecessary things. don't compare yourself to others. You are still young and have time to make your life a good one. You mom is able to work. thank goodness for that. make sure she is eating right and sleeping enough. Be a comfort to her and it will give her strength to go on. Learn to cook from scratch. Don't buy ready made foods or junk food. You'll eat well and save a lot of money on your groceries. keep you eyes open for any part time job you can do. this too shall pass. You don't need to depend on your father. just don't send him any money. If you don't go to the next grade in school and have to repeat this year, don't think it's the end of the world. It's just a little bump in the road.|`|UXuSI6EZaa	sorry to hear about your getting pinched. understand though that it's a temporary setback. you can actually deal with your future more squarely by knowing what you want to be & how you'd like your life to be, given the circumstances. knowing your goals now can help you do everything today to make it happen in the future. it also helps to pray to God for strength & guidance to move forward. with God, nothing is impossible!<br>  <br>  cheers,

5ZK9VGPCaa	I was like 18 and I'm not ugly or a loser, so I don't think you have anything to worry about. You don't "need" a bf. You seem to only want one because "half of your school is dating". Does that really matter though? Why don't you get a hobby instead? It will occupy your time and make you more interesting to guys at the same time.. It will just happen, you can't force it or "look for" someone.|`|VWvI5RyBaa	I'm guessing you're rather pretty, attractive, intelligent and distinguished.  All the women in my family only had boyfriends later because boys are too immature and are scared to ask girls like us out.  Now I'm 47 and old(personally I don't feel old but for a 16 year old girl it sounds old) and I had my first boyfriend at 18(university).  Boys are scared of rejection, they usually go with the cute ones or the easy ones, at least in their reach if you know what I mean.  They expect you to say no if they ask you out.  Men went through that phase already and have more confidence.  My grandmother was born in 1886 and had her first boyfriend in her 20's and got married at 28(had 8 children plus a few she miscarried).  She was an extremely beautiful woman, my mother was born in 1922, was also very beautiful and had one boyfriend in her 20's, then she met my father shortly after at 23 and got married at 25(had 3 children and miscarried a few).  I met my husband when I was 29 and got married at 32(have 3 children), my daughter is 14 1/2 and seems to have the same problem though she's still young.  However, I've seen boys looking at her but they didn't think they had a chance.  For a boy it's too much, you'll find someone when you meet a real man.  Advice? Either you change your way of looking somehow superior(that's what my grandmother was told, as well as my mother, myself and even some of my daughter's friend said that to her) or be yourself and wait to meet a man later(boys seem to get confidence in the transition from school to university) or you can meet someone a bit older.  I'm not trying to insult anybody here but it's a maturity thing, we look too mature for them, it's uncomfortable for boys.|`|4166cb92403b6e3aa52c0acf21d1f72faa	16, lasted 2 months<br>  I'm almost 17 now..with another guy..going 4 months:)<br>  dont worry your prince charming will come soon:D|`|OJIZQYDcaa	I'm 33 and I've never had a boyfriend, because I'm not a ***.|`|67115b1163cc8b9c69bf180fdf940ed7aa	well my real first BF was when i was 15.. i was in 10th grade<br>  u shouldn't worry, u'll get a BF at the right time.. no need to rush, live ur life :)|`|h9q8joY0aa	15...<br>  don't worry you have you're whole life ahead of you =]|`|AA10416503	Real talk,I was about 21 when i had my first real boyfriend all though before then I didn't know any better and I thought some of the guys I was seeing were my boyfriends but they were not and everyone knew it but me,so to make a long story short sweetie be careful and use your head if you went through half the things I went through by the time I was 16 you would not be even worried about boys,concentrate on you and Mr.Right will come along....Good Luck!|`|DJ9xfAq1aa	My real boyfriend when I was 25 years old. Actually, i wasnt even thinking about boys, and he was the one who came to me. I had friends, but was very careful and used my mind most of the time not to let them fool me because i had seen some friends' situations.<br>  There are some men who wants more than one girlfriend. They can fool you to a 100% that you will discover he has another woman or your the other woman at a very late time.|`|YteCvUZJaa	I was 15. We're still going strong since 2006, but like I say don't rush it. I know it most likely will get lonely with all the pairs running about, but its really not much of a rush. High school relationships, if anything, are loaded with drama. But if you really wanna be on the market, find someone who likes you. I'm sure someone likes you, you just don't know it yet.|`|ZZcYypXWaa	16 , dont worry about it when you go to college theres alot more boys to choose from lol, dont feel like you should be dating coz everyone else is find someone you like, i always was friends with them for a while first<br>  hope this helps :)|`|F51bF3nvaa	me till the age of 19 cuz i wanted to concetrate on my study first and just didnt want any relationship that isnt serious<br>  for me to fall in love = be with him and stay forever|`|RoyvUWl7aa	real boyfriend i guess 15|`|fwrfIxIaaa	pathetic as, 16 for me|`|iORKgGG2aa	my first real boyfriend was when I was 14 we lasted 2 yrs|`|tw73IYvBaa	Well i don't think you should worry. It just happens. My first boyfriend was at age15. A year older then you, but broke up after 3 months and did not date till I was 18. In my opinion is better not to have a boyfriend because they give you too many problems and you have to waste alot of your time. You are young. You shouldn't worry. I have a cousin who is 20 and never had a boyfriend and she is happy. Not that she does not want one or because shes ugly because shes not. She is very pretty. Don't hurry love. Eventually it will come to you.|`|C8bLCauaaa	You're weird. I was 13 with my first boyfriend. Put out a little more...Maybe a man will take you...|`|a481CieOaa	12 years old

5ivLSWQPaa	Once you start to write should be fairly easy. Here my short example for you. <br>  <br>  Eg: Mom it have been so long. I really appreciated the time that we spend together. Now that I know you are about to leave me. Not matter where you goes I'd like you to taking good care of yourself. I will on a side wishing you all the best. Some time I may being rude to you. Please forget me mom. I love you mom.<br>  <br>  Your daughter<br>  Date<br>  ^ Just expand it by add other thing that you want to says or tell her. Also you can talk about something that you both been thought together.|`|OyBuEpOTaa	You really don't' need to express all of your feelings to her, not so directly anyway. Tell her you'll miss her. You hate to see her go. You want her to be happy. You don't want to lose contact with her. You'll remember the fun times and hope to have more. make a date you can meet or call.
P3QRHXQnaa	dont think about the consequenses before talking to a girl lol|`|QFf9phAmaa	you start crying and weeping they will ask you what happen|`|iBH7NTl3aa	Say "Hi" simple as that!!|`|2S2onP86aa	You don't have to stress yourself and think of questions to start a conversation with them. Just say "Hi" and ask them like, what school do you go to? Or like, are you any good in bowling? Or like, tell them if they want to try playing with you? Introduceyourself. It comes naturally, really. So - I don't think you have to put a list of questions in your head. Just go for it. As simple as that.|`|1vJI7VQ0aa	just call one over and talk to her do not worry if the other laugh that is what girls are like .so answer just talk ask about the game there school.what they do on weekend/holidays etc.|`|vRc7ktcsaa	tell them "you got some big female traits right there." *look at the boobs*|`|RoyvUWl7aa	be yourself, be confident...that's sexy. act normal and look really good.|`|NnrS575eaa	hey<br>  well im 15 too, and the best advise i can probably give to you is just talk to them! be you (sounds corny but its true!)no point being someone else, theyll figure it out eventually. just try and walk up to them, not so obviously if ur scared, then say hi, ask them their names and say something funny, girls like to laugh. maybe go with some friends? be confident but not cocky<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|n8XVgHmUaa	just go to them make a couple of jokes , then introduce yourself and just talk and make jokes, because girls love to laugh|`|uq9BtLySaa	First u don't talk to them. just listen them. slowly slowly u could approach them...............|`|F51bF3nvaa	everything starts with a hello so dont be shy <br>  good luck to you
1poSSvTdaa	The only person who can answer this is your wife. it is sad that you didn't talk to her when she was with you. the most important thing in a marriage is talk, not sex. If you had talked you could have avoided this problem. Now you have to ask her if you can chat and try to work things out. She may agree.|`|RC8Pxx8eaa	You need to contact your wife and have a heart to heart talk with her, she sounds like she does not know what she wants.|`|Rkik3eUuaa	he meant that your wife couldn't get an orgasm with u. and if u don't know how it feels when a woman is orgasming (it doesn't mean she is moaning or wiggling under u, it means stuff happening down there and u would definitely feel it) it means u never made a woman orgasm. touchè.|`|DBH6kEClaa	Sex accounts for a great part of a healthy and sustainable marriage. Lots of women leave their partner on the basis of bad sex. Could you ever tell that she had an orgasm even once? You should definitely tell... as her whole body and behavior changes during an orgasm.

You just said the right words, and I can hope he'd respond in a positive way letting you know that you ARE that one girl he wants to date...<br>  Good Luck!!   ^_^|`|vGTF7wf0aa	you did good really good and i Hope he focuses on one girl like you<br>  <br>  i hope it makes feel less guilty. or a lot less guilty or make  you proud and that boy guilty . i am a girl maheenkhan18@rocketmail.com|`|2LNNY4Pgaa	thats really good.. it gives him options|`|QBlJj924aa	Girls just gotta let guys be sometimes and not stress out. Let the man be haha, "30 mins without him responding to my text OMG!!!"...it will be okay. <br>  <br>  He obviously likes you from what he says and by responding to you, don't scare him off. If you get a bad vibe, ain't worth it then. Just my two cents.|`|6ZReD2EXaa	You are full mantel or sex-maniac.Go to a doctor. Obey his advice.|`|AA11441704	This is great............speaks for all women like me who are in dilemma..........thanks.|`|ZPfCk0sZaa	ok you tell him exactly what you feel and what you want but if i were you i will wait until knowing what he wants from me and this wii be clear from his deeds so you make him know that he is important to you and you don't know whether he has the same or not. and you suppose because he has once an ex girlfriend which is not pretty that he think in you in this time and you believe him if he wants you why he doesn't reply your emails and why he date this girl

5ZK9VGPCaa	All girls have this problem. I am not shy and with guys I am normally fine.. outgoing etc, but if there's a guy I like I get really shy around him (and I'm 22!).. and don't know what to say and feel self conscious and awkward and end up saying something dumb. Although I only get this a little bit now, where as when I was 18 I literally wouldn't know what to say to a guy I liked. So I guess it gets better as you get older. Just relax and try and imagine he is one of your guy friends who you don't fancy and then just talk to him about normal things. Or think of some "emergency questions" beforehand which you can pull out if there is a silence. Juts casual questions / conversation starters or questions about things you want to know about him. Or not necessarily questions but just tell him about things that happened to you this week.. interesting things like crazy things that happened (obviously not "oh I bought these really cute shoes.."). lol|`|2vuIC6DJaa	i m aguy and guys have this problem too. so tell ur self tat hes prob just as nervous as u and just talk to him. you know how ppl say guys sohuld always appraoch the girl? most guys dont have the guts. start any type of convo and if u see a positive reaction or ny flirtin from him u know he likes u. u have to break the ice if u like him. just think of it like this. even if he doesnt like u  ucan be friends. if he does like u then u got a bf. and your realy prety he prob likes u too. and its psychologicaly proven that over 30% of the ppl who u like likes u bak. I dunon how to explain but its true lol
UAq9ogIQaa	i want to find a girl that wants to wait till we are married.<br>  sex is a sacred thing between two souls,and shouldnt be taken lightly.<br>  lots of guys just want sex.lets face it it is part of our programing,our sex drive....however look for the guy that will wait<br>  if two people love one another,they should be happy with just being around each other,and spending time together.laughing together,hugging and kissing each other,holding hands and staring into each others eyes...<br>  i have had alot of causual sex over the years,and i got to the point where companionship and love is far far more important than just sex.<br>  sex is nice,but is that all there is to being human? no,people need the softer aspects of love,like cuddling,and sharing company,and well just having a soul mate.<br>  if a guy really really loves you he will wait,if all he wants is to screw you,what does that say? it says he values your body more than your spirit,and this isnt good,you are more than just your vagina.<br>  you are a person,with a personality,a spirit,this is whats important about you,not your sex organ.<br>  if you find the right guy,he will love you for you,not your you know what.<br>  do you love a guy just for his penis? no,you love his laugh,his smile,his personality..we all have to stop just valueing sex,and start valueing the sacred bond between a man and a women,because without true love this world would just be a hell hole of sin,and sex isnt love..only caring about anothers spirit and wellbeing is love.<br>  but when you trully love one another,and care completely about that person,and you are married,then lovemaking is a sacred act between two people who want to create a child out of the love they have for eachother.<br>  look at the world today,so many people just want only sex,and then since they didnt trully love one another,the kids who are accidents have a hellish life ahead of them because they were not planned by people who wanted them,they offten have troubled lives,cause they were made out of lust,not love......poor children,they pay for it their whole lives|`|eKBumLUZaa	The answer is "No "guys" do not only want sex. Children however do and is why they should refrain from doing so.<br>  <br>  For mature adults sex is not a tool or a conquest to be had. If you want to wait then wait you should. The man you find that relates too and is okay with the relationship will be the one for you. Not the one who pressures you. Anyone who pressures you is nothing more that a simpleton whom can not afford any free brain cells for anything else in life.|`|FzFSzilmaa	sex is a natural thing... we are genetically pre-programmed to want sex... one way or another...<br>  <br>  many men DON'T want a relationship... and aren't sexually repressed about sex before marriage... and many women are the same... they don't need commitment or a ring in order to have sex...<br>  <br>  try living in the now...|`|3YRrGfkiaa	No.  I wouldn't want to marry someone only to discover that we're sexually incompatible.|`|CQucEJedaa	realationships aren't just about sex or (as some people like myself would prefer to refer to it as) making love. Yes it can be a wonderfull experience for both people but sometimes its to soon to introduce it into a realationship, i cant say what most guys would do but myself if you really love someone its worth the wait and in the long run makes it that much better. on the other hand it can be EXTREMELY difficult to do such it just depends on the people. But to answer your question there are some guys that only want sex but alot of others like myself who see a realationship as more than that.|`|U0BuV98Eaa	the thoughts of love and sex make us do crazy things that we overlook.<br>  im a guy, and ofcourse sex is once in a while on my mind. but you have to play your part and not provoke it. <br>  <br>  because it takes two people to make sex happen, and or two people to make love happen. if the two dont agree, then one will eventually leave to seduce another for satisfaction.|`|2bd743df23ae5873f084966f57f0f29aaa	Sex, or the possibility of it is a powerful motivation for a man. I think it's a biological thing and any cultural aspect enforced on the human nature is meaningless and repressive to a degree.|`|TZ1Z2nhhaa	Guys will not wait if they are not having sex with you . Your sure they are having it with someone else.|`|vRc7ktcsaa	yes and no. it depends on the guy.|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	Guys usually do only want sex, but they also want to be loved and be taken care of.|`|b82ybE3gaa	I don't think EVERY guy wants to only have sex. The only thing with guys, is that they either can't get their emotions in check, as in they either feel nothing for you and just have sex, or they feel everything for you and have sex, <br>  <br>  Men (and yes some "boys" claim to be men) are really the much better choice. But don't be fooled with that either cause age doesn't turn a Boy Into A Man.
IGuLbST7aa	I am a 20 year-old college student. I go out to parties and kiss girls and had a girlfriend for 2 years that never resulted in sex. <br>  <br>  GOSH has it been hard. Honestly sooo damn hard. but I am gonna keep on goin. I cant wait to be able to tell my wife "I waited for you, baby. It was really hard but i love you more than them!" GOSH that sounds nice! : ) <br>  <br>  Good luck! Everyone i've talked to whom has had sex wished they had waited. Im betting that its worth it|`|a0024a8805bd3c2a385199e722566faeaa	HELL NO!  Most of the women I know that want to wait til marriage who are over the age of 21 are socially inept.  I met someone recently who was absolutely beautiful, but her social skills were horrible.  <br>  <br>  If that's your religious belief to wait for marriage, then by all means do what you feel is morally right.  Just keep in mind that a great majority of society does not wait til marriage...and most of the pastors I know personally didn't either.  <br>  <br>  You have to also think about the man you will attract that is willing to wait.  He's either lying and getting his sex elsewhere, or he has social issues of his own.  Keep in mind that any man worth having has options.  Very few choose the option that requires them to get married before sex.  In fact, most men I know won't commit to a relationship prior to sex.|`|dfTQCf5saa	I am probably not quite old enough to answer this.<br>  Nor have I had the experience - no marriage or sex yet :)<br>  But I don't think I am going to wait. <br>  I am not sure why, but even though I am pretty sure I won't wait, I will be careful-ish :P<br>  I don't think there are any rules about it, it is just how you personally feel, and you shouldn't be pressured into anything, and stick by your beliefs.<br>  And pay more attention to the answers with better background info lol.|`|8VSImZsKaa	i have a friend she is 22 and she waited. I know it was hard for her and him. I would always hear she talking about sex with him and kind of having phone sex lol.. When she got back she told me it was the best thing in the world.

I loved the guy and had sex with him. I don't think there is a point in waiting until you're married. Unless you believe in that (culture) but that doesn't mean go out and have pointless sex. I just mean that as long as you love the guy, it's ok.|`|AA11293118	nope itr doesnt mean u have to wait till marraige..but u shud be married to him or her later.coz sex means nt only pleasure but a sharing mind and relation..not the case with prostitutes|`|dd0d57e5ff24820c6981c10f9097112faa	no, but the first time i had sex, i imagined that my bf was my 'husband' and that we'd marry someday.  but, my folks split us up.  <br>  <br>  so, i suggest if youve never had it and are a religious person...dont have it until youre married.|`|XsLj9jERaa	Nope, but we're getting married =D<br>  He's my true love...and I can't explain it enough...it was love at first sight...<br>  I had been dreaming of my prince charming my entire life and he...<br>  was exactly who I dreamt of.<br>  He's incredible.<br>  Umm we have been dating for almost a year but had sex after only a month :/ <br>  It was weird...because I was planning to wait at least a year and probably to marriage...but it was fate. <br>  It was hard at first because I was scared that maybe it wouldn't last...<br>  but I love him more than ever =D|`|FzFSzilmaa	no, i didn't...<br>  <br>  but then i'm not repressed when it comes to sex, and don't feel the need to have peer pressure affect me or be indoctrinated by religion...<br>  <br>  i make my own choices about my life and know that life is too short to make something so natural into some "spiritual" thing...|`|eQENZXz1aa	why wait till married most marriages end in divorce so in the end you waited for nothing <br>  <br>  Plus no one buys a car before test driving it.|`|4vv1ElyJaa	Well I'm still a virgin (15) but I am not waiting until marriage.

fwdnXIOoaa	Two years is long enough to be passed the honeymoon stage and into the "I'm so comfortable with you now you're just like part of the furniture" stage. A relationship without the sexual chemistry is doomed especially at your young age.  Your hormones should be bouncing off the walls and if you don't feel the physical attraction after 2 years its time to do one of two things.<br>  <br>  Spice up your marriage or agree to be just friends and get a divorce.  Its a win win situation either way.  Spicing up your marriage will be fun but if you just don't feel the vibe then you need to be with someone you do have that sexual chemistry with.  <br>  <br>  Try this excercise.

If not then just get a divorce, i have been miserable for 8 years, with 2 kids and know i feel very stuck in t his marriage. So don't make my mistake, learn from it... Good luck.|`|uXyZ7fTzaa	i have the same problem the only difference is that we got married only 6months after our first date and 2yrs later we had a baby i don't regret her at all(my baby) . after 5yr later of been married i still don't feel nothing for him i just love him as a friend. I guess what im trying to say is that if you don't have kids and you are only 20 just go your way you are to young to be like that,  please don't get pregnant and if you already have a baby remember in order for you to make your child or your husband happy, you have to be happy first and that's not been selfish it is the truth.|`|AA11791540	maybe you need a tough guy. wait when you go through life experience with bad husbands, then you will cry back to him (your husband now).|`|u33x2hqzaa	If you are not mature enough to handle it, then maybe you did get married too soon.  I'm not trying to judge you in saying that but marriage takes a lot of work & friendship is the foundation, not sex or passion.  Besides passion can't last forever and love comes & goes.  I find when it comes back, the love is stronger & deeper than ever because you have weathered some storms together and see that it can last.  Ultimately marriage is a commitment to stay together, you know for better or worse....  You gotta decide if you're ready for it.  Good luck.<br>  <br>  Edit: I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings on the maturity comment.  That was not my intent.  I just believe that marriage is a commitment to work it out.  Again, good luck & God bless.

FSruw622aa	I'm not married, but I can say that I have had the experience of dating a girl that was pretty much the same as your son and it was BAD. <br>  <br>  I don't think spoiling someone results 100% in them growing up thinking they are always entitled to things or given things for free, but I can say that it's not the best way to help a child grow into an adult.<br>  <br>  You must sit down and have a talk with your wife.  If she still doesn't think it's right, then you must go to a counselor... at least a financial counselor.<br>  <br>  A husband and a wife should act as a single unit, not as separate parts.  Well, at least that's how I feel.<br>  <br>  If nothing works, then I don't know what you must do, but I can say that you must try something.  If you don't mind, I'll say a quick prayer for you, your wife, and your son.|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	Your wife is an idiot, she is doing him no favors and he will hate her for it soon, sounds like he is already on his way, he will ned up dead or in prison for life if this continues, kids need rules and structure esp in the teens, your wife is dooming your son, period. You all need to go to family counseling leave your wife and you son to fend for themselves for a few months, this is ridiculous.|`|ZzEAc5ecaa	just get your son ..and wife .. sit them down .. and tell them its stops today as ..you are the man of the house .. and your rules must be obeyed from now on .. or move out .. mate its the only way back..|`|872fcc76954a83920779a9df510b118baa	yeah i'm not too sure to be honest, have you talked with your son about this very much though?  he might get a huge boost off of your real concern for him and his future in his relationships, some day he has to take the reigns of life and romance, and that may or may not come easily for him being doted upon for so much.  he can only grow to be strong and reliable with your advice.|`|EPTaL9Ajaa	Why is she like that? <br>  Was it because her parents were too strict, and she would've wanted the same when she was young?<br>  Tell her about the consequences of spoiling your son, and is her giving him everything really making her feel happy and loved back?|`|AA10886262	where's your spine?  take control of this mess or you are going to have a grandchild before you know it....not to mention a son on drugs.....|`|I6KKFwxXaa	for every one year of bad behavior it takes 6 years to replace it sorry to say your son learned early on how to push mom into doing exactly what he wanted her to do and she may even be a little afraid of him if he has been even the slightest bit not to say violent but raising his voice to her, cussing at her, or even making movements toward her to get her to comply with what he wants. By her giving him money when you try to discipline him this is saying "oh it's ok honey you don't have to listen." therefore yes it would cause problems between the two parents and your son knows it and knows how to manipulate it in his favor. This is not bad parenting it is a learned behavior. As his father you should step up and teach him responsibility for his actions when he talks to her that way take something out of his room that means a lot to him and tell him in order to get it back you have to earn it make him do things around the house without complaining about it. It is not going to be easy but maybe even a father and son get away and sit him down talk to him like a man he is practically almost one in his eyes anyway. Leave cell phones and video games at home so there are no distractions. Good Luck hope this helps|`|zAOYXT2Oaa	It sounds like you might need to put your foot down, and speak with both of them. <br>  <br>  Explain to your wife that you can't afford all of the money she is spending. Then also tell your son that you are worried about him. If you are worried he is already having sex, then hopefully you will sit down with him and explain to him that he needs to use a condom. <br>  <br>  I hope everything works out for you.|`|HTTKNa4Qaa	Well, i can see where your coming from and where your wife is, has he given you any reason to not let him stay out late, stay at his gf's. If no then let it go, unless he does do something then try to take it away from him. About the other stuff well buying him stuff, dunno, tell your wife you cant afford it?|`|c4c68b032b3f303e52a013f1376dc505aa	if she isnt willing to take control it is up to you, and you have to put your foot down to not only your son , but you have to put your foot down with her also. take control of the situation, save him and save your marriage also .|`|DdSKcoOSaa	no|`|2M68xiN5aa	It seems to me your wife has some issues she needs to deal with, acceptance maybe? And I'm sorry to say your son sounds like he needs good old fashioned discipline.<br>  <br>  I would suggest asking your wife to go to counseling to start with the two of you. A counselor could help you two get on the same page. Remind her that YOU TWO are PARTNERS for life in all aspects and you BOTH only want what is best for your son. Once you are both on the same page you could try your own approaches or a family counselor as well. <br>  <br>  It is never good when parents aren't on the same page. The kids end up learning lessons WAY too late. Trust me I was one of them! My parents seperated when I was 16 and refused to speak to eachother. Prior to their seperation I had a 4.0 GPA was an honor student and well on my way to any college I wanted. I ended up dropping out of high school. For 2 years I fumbled my way through life until I DECIDED to get my stuff together. I got my GED started attending community college. After recieving my AAS I transfered to a 4 year school. My point is it made life very hard for me. I learned lessons too late and my parents learned too late that they couldn't just give me whatever to avoid communication with eachother or confrontation with me. When I finally learned my lesson and wanted to go to college they wouldn't support me financially for school or otherwise. I worked full time and went to school full time. It took me 6 years to obtain a 4 year degree. It was a serious struggle! <br>  <br>  Like I said get on the same page with your wife. It is imparative you both straighten out your son BEFORE he gets much older or his and your life will be 10x harder!|`|h27GxkZ0aa	Dear Greg,<br>  <br>  The today's case has a background of fifteen long years.<br>  <br>  My suggestion is, you take your wife and son to the house of one of your known fellows who have dutiful children and spend a few days there. Without doing any thing, a mere association will do the wonders.<br>  <br>  If you don't find such family in your circle, make a trip to India and spend a few days with us.<br>  <br>  What is true love and respect for parents, your son will understand within no time.<br>  <br>  It will give me a sense of fulfilment that I have contributed towards the betterment of humanity.<br>  <br>  Regards,<br>  Shashi Bhushan Sharma<br>  Email-motivatorsbs@gmail.com
ag1FlcFnaa	why feel bad because you talk to other people other then her? no shes just very jealous that you are spending time talking to someone other then her. maybe she is interested in you who knows... good luck !!|`|lTsONvwQaa	tell her its not fair to say that cause she isnt being a good friend either the level of your popularity shouldnt matter. if you are friends and get along that should be enough|`|07xi6IOSaa	you can't do anything about her self esteem and insecurity. all you can do is try to be her friend, and try to be patient. don't let her issues cause you to have issues within yourself. misery loves company.|`|ZiYLLh6Iaa	just speak to her about it, she might be jealous of you, but spend some time with her, go out to the cinema as mates or something like that, spend some quality time with her.
KwZDZ1lSaa	I think there will always be a time in school when these kinds of problems occur. I mean, one can never expect their best friends to stick with them for ever and ever and ever. Perhaps your two best friends just wants a break, or they feel that they themselves need to change. You can try to support their desicion of leaving the group (as much as you hate it), and instead try to hang out with some other people, whether they already have friends or not. It never hurts to try. Once your best friends realizes that you are having fun without them, they will hopefully automatically come back to you. For now, you jsut let them be. the more you bother them, the more annoyed they will feel.|`|nCMUA50Raa	dont worry about it they're just trying to make u jealous is what it sounds like...girls at this age go through things like this...just forget them..and who says u cant join a new group of friends??...theres always room for more friends in ur life...dont worry about it to much...you will have more friends again!! and  you will find true friends who will stick by you always!!|`|1OxiOk2taa	I am sory it is hard when friends split up after so long! You need to have a heart-to-heart with your friends, so they can really explain why they are leaving you. Try to join a club, or make an effort to be nice to different people. Hope things work out!|`|shMZBv7zaa	seems like they just don't want you to be around anymore. don't get too worked up over this, you'll make new friends. i'm sure of it. join a club?
AA12135516	Firstly i don't think the lady next door should have dragged your mother into it but as they say..."what's done is done." <br>  <br>  Unfortunately your mother is on to you now so there's nothing more you can do to help the girl, so if i were you i'd just explain to the girl what's happened & just keep out of it from now on because you've done all you can to help & it's really between the girl & her mother.|`|HM3pWPMoaa	i know u r helping her the girls mom should'nt have put your mom into it if she has a problem with it she should have talked to her daughter,but i say over all if u like the girl take her out buy her one,accourse one u like .|`|Yql4TNQGaa	Hi there Kid, Carlos here!! I can say that is a problem. Good guess about your mum, but I would suggest a more sinister plot. I think you may be horrified to discover that in fact your mother is simply converting the bikinis for the secret (legless) love child she keeps down in the basement.
2zgv89OQaa	Even though he may be a great guy, this could be a potential problem with you if don't just completely back away from him.   It could eventually effect the relationship that your in now.  Be honest with him that you want only his friendship and let him know that you're already with someone that you care about.|`|lTsONvwQaa	Ask him to back off. and tell him you will never be more then friends|`|Z4IESo10aa	well i think you should tell him how you feel about the whole situation and tell him so that you can still be friends. just  phone him, txt him or meet with him and tell him how you feel about how he is acting with you. if you feel uncomftable with it why should you live with it all the time when he is around you.<br>  <br>  hope this helps xx|`|P1je9iWzaa	sorry but thats just plain weird.<br>  <br>  let him go, if he really loved you he wouldnt irritate you like that.<br>  <br>  xox|`|Z3W8t5QJaa	Damn, how annoying that must be for you. Just say that too him. Stop bugging me all the time, your only my friend for christs sake. This relationship cant progress into anything. I dont know. I suck.|`|8d79a4e1999cf914bedfcbe3074786e0aa	Something very similar to this happened to me. <br>  <br>  I was dating 'rick' and i met a great guy 'kent' ... kent was always very over confident and funny he told me he was in love with me and told everyone else he was as well even though I was in a relationship at the time. I told him that I was in love with my bf and that I really enjoyed his company and wanted to be friends... eventually he became my best friend.<br>  <br>  best thing for you to do it be honest with him... tell him you only want to be friends and that you have no plans to end your current relationship... as much as this might hurt him he needs to know it... tell him that you think he is a great guy and that you want to be friends and nothing more, and that you want him to stop declaring his love as it is make you uncomfortable.

It's that childish.. She didn't understand you. If she did, she would have waited for your head to cool off. now, she should have asked for forgiveness for the childish thing she did.

If the only thing you became angry on is the police thing which was very serious, then, it might be just because you got embarrassed. She may have done it because he really loves you..

There are so many things that we have going through our heads with guys, but not many of us actually stop to think of how he may be thinking of it.<br>  I had one where I just thought we were talking, but I forgot to reply to one message, no idea why, and he like let loose on me.<br>  I finally worked out that he must've liked me, but we must of gotten our wires crossed or something! I feel bad now but he is getting a bit clingy, and he has kind of ruined our friendship a bit, as he lost my respect (but he did some other stuff that I'm sure you haven't!)<br>  Also, we weren't as close (I thought), but we were only at the stage of messaging.<br>  <br>  Look, maybe just some space and time will do it.<br>  Have you asked what you can do to fix it?<br>  I think admitting you were wrong - even if you don't entirely think you were - could help.<br>  It would be a shame for you guys to lose your friendship, and you sound a lot closer than my situations.<br>  Wow there is so much I can talk to you about, so you can email me if you want, but otherwise good luck with it all!<br>  Even though females in general don't need as much time to think things over compared to males, all people are different!<br>  And I know that I just had to think about it by myself for a while before deciding anything.<br>  <br>  Again, good luck mate!<br>  And hope I helped!!|`|AA12126891	listen, if its love she should feel the same.

How many times has she flirted with you and made you feel that way<br>  its simple she was just playing around with your emotions.<br>  a girl will always know if a man is loving her or just being her friends and its their duty( well humanity) to stop things right away upfront and not let this feeling grow in a man to reject and break him in future. in my eyes she doesnt even deserve to be your friend, she used you for good company.<br>  remember what i say and its a wise decision from my own experience........" if after all this she still doesnt believe it then she will never believe it because she doesnt want to believe it" <br>  move on, you are nice and you deserve someone who gives you the same amount of niceness in return|`|AA11096397	She sounds as if she has emotional issues.  Leave her to it.  If she makes this much fuss this early in the relationship, imagine how she'll be when you really have problems later down the line!|`|0xRhEUo5aa	Yeah i think your right. All the answers are pretty much the same way i feel. But you really should have asked her in person.|`|8jvsiu8jaa	It's obvious she only likes you as a friend. Sometimes girls flirt and it doesn't mean anything. You have to accept that nothing but friendship will come out of this so either be her friend or don't, but don't keep false hope that something more will develop.|`|AA10416503	Im sorry but not to be offensive but this chic is just not into you,It only takes a second for us to change our minds about something,Now I admit she probably was interested in you at the beginning but it was something from the start until now that made her think"Hey I don't want to be with this dude".That is why she is making up lame excuses and getting mad at you for dumb reasons so sweetie just LET IT GO! their is no need to sit around being depressed over someone who is not stressing over you!!!|`|FS5F3Ryyaa	ARe you sure it was her that got your email and messaged you back  maybe it was some one that read her email and pretended to be her  if you both got on so will in person why would she get so upset  with you ,you say she was flirting with you and you with her it doesn't make sense I would invite her over to your place or ask if you can come over  as you miss hanging out together as friends see what she says tell her you miss her cooking and her smile|`|noDo16ZMaa	F*ck her (not to offend you ), <br>  <br>  Just find another girl and flirt with her ,or whatever you want hahaha<br>  <br>  The life is too short to be spent  on serious relation ships , why the hell do you want one anyways ??You can still be friends with benifits :))<br>  <br>  Have fun , dont waste time on rotten girls , eventually there will be time when all of that will finish and you will finally find a perfect other half .....lived happily ever after .bluh bluh bluh .<br>  <br>  peace

All obsessions are unhealthy.|`|ZzEAc5ecaa	yes it can .. but it can stop at anytime you want to .. just talk to him/her about the time ..you need|`|8d79a4e1999cf914bedfcbe3074786e0aa	It all depends on the person... <br>  <br>  I play online games (mmorpg) and I know they require quite a bit of time if you want to do well... but if you can schedule your time and know your limits then you will have no problems.<br>  <br>  but also I have a friend who plays the same type of games... but he has become completely engrossed in them like it is his whole life... he will be on the computer for hours and hours ignoring everything else going on in the real world around him.|`|F3EeUHuKaa	Yes people get sick of living life alone when someone puts a computer before them|`|FzFSzilmaa	yep...<br>  <br>  haven't you seen all the sad questions on here about WoW addicts???
PPoyjq3Vaa	I don't know if States keep marriage records.    But counties do.  Your first step would be to order a copy of this marriage license from Orange County, Florida. <br>  <br>  For Orange County licenses received on or after March 1, 1998, you may obtain a copy for $1.00 or certified copy for $2.50 from:<br>  <br>  Orange County Comptroller's Office<br>  Attn: Official Records Department<br>  P.O. Box 38<br>  Orlando, FL 32802<br>  <br>  Physical Address:<br>  401 S. Rosalind Ave.<br>  Orlando, FL 32802<br>  (407) 836-5115<br>  <br>  (If I were you, i''d send a money order purchased at the post office... the County Clerks  usually don't take checks).|`|AA11441704	Go to the owner of the record and ask
