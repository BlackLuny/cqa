Im trying to move my kitchen around for remodel and want to move my stove to the wall that is 90 degrees of it, except that is the  only wet wall (plumbing is there behind the drywall).  Can I do that and do I have to change the drywall out to a more fire/heat resistant  backerboard?  I plan on tiling or placing a backsplash above the stove, but what about lower?  Thanks

Estoy en una 2a residencia de veraneo y en los ultimos a?os me he encontrado con el probelma de que toda ropa de algodón que se pone en la lavadora perjudica de una manera importante su color y la calidad de tejido. He tenido que tirar mucha ropa y busco soluciones y no encuentro, parece que en el pueblo (estoy en los Pirineos catalanes)  ala gente no le pasa lo mismo, y a mi madre tampoco (ella usa tejidos sedosos que son resistentes y no pierden color).            Fui a la lavanderia del pueblo y creo que pasa igual. Nuestro lavadora tiene unos 30 a?os y la cambiaremos, aunque no creo que sea el problema. Tampoco creo que venga de un problema de cal en el agua, no se estropean los aparatos.            Hablamos con el alcalde y nos dijo que esto es del cloro que ponen obligados por ley para prevenir infecciones. El agua no sabe mal, pìca un poco la pìel cuando te duchas, pero no sé si será este el problema de que a lo mejor hay demasiado cloro.             Me podríais ayudar por favor, para mi supone un gran y misterioso problema ya que mido 2 metros y me cuesta mucho encontrar ropa como para tirarla casi en un lavado.            Si el problema viene del cloro que se podría hacer?                  Muchísimas gracias por adelantado, esto es un desespero...

My dads 5 year old goodman hvac system has had a problem for a while and doesn't have the money to get it fixed by a pro right now. Its a split system when i say split i mean there's a air handler for upstairs which is in the attic and another air handler in the crawlspace. The one in the crawlspace is the one that's having the problem with the fan blower. The unit outside turns on and off just fine the problem is the blower inside the air handler will not shut off after the unit outside has shut off.      Also there is sometimes a low noticeable buzz when the AUX heat turns on. There is no problem with the unit outside nor is it from the thermostat the switch is always set to "auto" not "on". I know its the air handler i just don't know how to fix it to make it shut off when the unit shuts off like its suppose to. If anyone could give me any info on how to fix this, I would be most grateful.

20070630120840AAz4EsD	Home & Garden;Other - Home & Garden	How can I fix my futon mattress?	I've been using my cheap, metal futon only as a sofa since I bought my bed a few months ago, but it's becoming less and less comfortable.  The mattress is slipping through the crack between the back of the futon and the seat, and no matter which way I turn it, it keeps doing so. This makes sitting in it more painful than relaxing and I often find myself sitting on the floor instead. Is there any way to fix my mattress?
