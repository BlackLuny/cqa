I know its long but please read it.ok there is this girl I am kind of interested in.

20090205085321AAFgKbD	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Can we really take the next step with things this way?	I met this really nice guy. I like him alot. We have great conversations. He is brilliant. I have feelings for him, and he says he has them for me. His close friends are a group of women who are very vocal about the fact they do not like me. They disagree with my point of view on topics that do not involve my relationship with this man...and frankly are none of their business. He is aware of my feelings and agrees with me completely.   We can't spend time together where they might see us because they can be very catty and try to pick fights. I could care less about their rantings and threats...but it makes him uncomfortable. He says he has spoken to them about it. They don't show him the respect of dropping it. So now...when we hang out it is alone and in secret. I don't like it. I respect his friendship. I don't want to interfere or make things uncomfortable between them.  I may not like these girls but he does, so I was willing to play nice. I promise (for me at least) jealousy is not an issue. I have mostly male friends myself. There is nothing wrong with it and if any of them were to come to me, in protest or concern about him I would listen to their opinion. I would likely follow their advice, but...men are protectors. They look out for me. I realize they don't need a woman to fight their battles. And, they realize humiliating me by attacking someone I am with is immature. I would never ask him to chose...but by keeping me a secret from them...hasn't he?

20090205085102AAIVGhL	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why does a relationship mean 2 people?	I don't understand this. Everyone thinks their only choice is to have 1 other person for the rest of their life. Why did this happen? The concept is completely illogical.      Why doesn't the concept of 2 guys 1 girl, or 2 girls 1 guy, or 2 guys 2 girls ever even enter most individuals minds as an option? once you mention other options they usually realize they have more choices and how much less drama and stress it causes, but until then the concept just seems foreign to most.      Most try to force themselves into this unnatural concept of what they feel a 'relationship' is supposed to look like      It just doesn't make any sense to me.

We use to go to the same college until I dropped out but we didn’t study the same course, we both work for Sainsbury’s but in different stores and we live close to each other. I don’t want to go up there and ask how I feel about her and ask for her number. The only thing I can think of is going up to her and asking that she looks really familiar and liar to her about that I was in her class in college. Then I’ll ask what time she finishes work and I’ll say finish work at the same time and maybe I could drop her off.

20090205084654AAIPAZ1	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why is my boyfriend acting like this?	I love my boyfriend, but I feel like he doesn't love me back.  I'm constantly telling him that I love him, and he gets annoyed because I'm being too cute.  When he's frustrated, he takes out all of his frustration on me.  When I agree with the arguments he makes while he's frustrated, he gets more frustrated.  Things have been like that for a while, and I never thought much of it.  A few months back, we broke up, and after we got back together, he stopped saying things like he wanted to be with me.  He also says things that are kind of out of line.  Here's an example:  We are watching The Office (American), and in season 4, Jim tells the camera crew that he has had an engagement ring for Pam since soon after they started dating.  I started feeling jealous of Pam because she had an engagement on the way.  My boyfriend said I shouldn't feel jealous because he has had a ring since before we got together (he was previously engaged).  Despite the fact that my boyfriend said this, he refuses to ask (knowing full well that the answer will be yes).      I just want to know why he would be making me feel unwanted so much?
20090205084700AAnJleM	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	I want to go on a break to get everything out of my system, but i told him i needed space, is that cheating?	my boyfriend and i have been dating for almost a year, i love him i do. before we were dating i was dating a guy a bit older and he made me so happy but i knew it couldn't work only because the big age difference and my family would never accept it. my boyfriend and i live together im a freshman in college but we never go out he doesn't spend time with me, doesn't show affection toward me and  never wants to have sex. i feel like im unattractive and it really hurts me. hes always so busy with work, and i understand i just want a little love.  so i told him i wanted to go on a break and that i need some space, he was upset at first which is understandable. so tonight im going to this other guys house and im staying over, i don't really want to go on a break but i want to get everything out of my system so that my boyfriend and i could be happy so that when im with this other guy i could see that i miss my boyfriend so much and that we are really ment to be together not me and this other guy.  I feel since were on a break that its not cheating i jsut want to better my relationship and i just need to stop thinking its always better on the other side when i know its not, i jsut need to prove it to myself.  Is this a bad idea, or does it make complete sence.
20090205084710AA62TEr	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Did i do this to him or was he a player from the start?	We were from different social circles and backgrounds but that never bothered me because i thought he was a good person.      however, he started saying things like ' you can do better then me' etc esp when he started having some financial trouble. i never asked him to buy me anything or even mentioned money etc.      he didnt understand why i liked him because he thought i was too pretty for him and he hated when other guys would look at me or talk to me when we were out. I told him that i go for personality not looks!      He said he loved me and that i was different to his ex's. but i was a virgin when i met him and he kept saying that sex wasn't important but then he asked me to stop teasing him when we were fooling around. i said i would have sex when i felt ready and he said that was fine.      then he started going on about his needs and how he needs more then love. then we broke up cos he started to scare me.      now hes with an older woman, who like his ex is controlling him. shes the same race as me but from a similar background to him and hes boasting to ppl that she does whatever he wants. shes 40 with two grown up sons and is divorced.      his friend joked with him that shes hardly an upgrade from me.      i really cared about this guy and i tried to help in so many ways with his business and personal stuff etc.      Was it wrong of me to fool around with him and get him excited? did i drive him to the post-break up sex phase? he seems a bit nuts now.

20090205085915AAu9jkR	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What is going thru his head?	I am not trying to be mean just state facts and get the rational behind this, I broke up w/ my fiance, which was a big mistake he has started "dating" this girl who is overweight, works at a disgusting bar, and isn't particuarly pretty and also drinks.  This is not his type whatsoever, he has always his entire life dated normal-thin type girls, who are well groomed and attractive.  I am not saying there is anything wrong w/ bigger girls, but he has always not found them attractive and said negative things about them.  Also the extent of their "relationship" apparently is him going out to this bar while she bartends and I am assuming getting free drinks.  Meanwhile he tells me that he still is in love w/ me, although we are not back together, and that he is very "confused" as to what to do.

The first time i met him was when i was 9. We became very  close friends, how a father and daughter should be. Then two months later, he started shooting up again. he went back to prison.

But 3 months later, he started again. He's suposed to be released when i'm sixteen. But im not sure what to do.   I mean should i talk to him?

One day he text me something and I was in a mood so i replied with so what? and he text back telling me to f*** off cause i'm a moody ***** and w/e but usually after apologising for being like this everything is ok again. But despite trying to talk to him several times and even try to annoy him so he at leasts argues with me so i can find out what the problem is he just ignores. He has deleted me from his facebook and everything. I don't want to lose him as a friend cause he was one of my closest but i just dunno how to solve this when he is not willing to sort things out and i don't even know what i've done!! :( what do i do??????? and anyone hazard a guess as to why he might no longer wanna talk to me after being friends for about 2/3 years??
20090205090112AAS86jU	Family & Relationships;Weddings	How do you word an invitation for an already married couple?	My husband and I were married last September. We had a private civil service and want to hold the celebration with family and friends this summer. I am aware that it is not called a reception because it isn't a celebration immediately after the service. I want it to be pretty formal, so would getting an actual wedding dress and having a "wedding party" be tacky or too late to do?      How would we word our invitations? Also, we never said our vows so could we repeat the ceremony in a church or elsewhere and what would it be called?       Thank you!
20090205085557AAKyzca	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Can ANYONE explain what might be going on?  I'm completely confused and need some good advice!?	My boyfriend and I have been dating for almost 8 years now.  We've had our ups and downs like every relationship - sometimes we have a blast together and sometimes we dislike each other.  I've currently run into a situation regarding my relationship and I'm having a difficult time making a decision and could really use some good advice...      Some important background information is necessary.  So about five years ago or three years into the relationship, I found inappropriate conversations and e-mails trying to meet up with people that he had met in online chat rooms.  I confronted him, multiple times, about all the things I found and he denied it was him at first, and then he promised never to do it again.  He told me it was an outlet in which he could be himself without being judged.  Ok, his mistake, maybe he had a hard time opening up intimately – I understand it’s difficult to trust people in that way.  I know he loved me and would never actually go through with it, so I took his word and moved on.      Fast-forward to present time - eight years into our relationship or five years since the previously discussed scandal.  I found him searching craigslist erotic services for all types of **** - men, women, trannies, orgies, etc.  He's even gone so far as to respond to a few ads while I was at work seeing if he could meet up with these people.  I don't have any evidence implying that he's actually met up with anyone or not.  I’ve been monitoring his actions for the past few months and he’s still browsing every once in a while.  I know I have to confront him, but I feel like I need more hard evidence so he can’t lie to my face.  I also feel like I need more hard evidence to justify my leaving the relationships.  I’m just not sure what evidence I am looking for or when I’ll get enough evidence to make a decision.        I've tried to get him to talk about any possible fantasies he might have and try to get him to open up sexually to me, but he never mentions any crazy things he wants to try.  I mean, we probably have as much sex as every other healthy couple, so it's not like he's deprived.  He JUST recently (in the past six months or so) opened up and started talking about masturbating, but only because I pressed the issue.          I am furious and upset and am not sure what to do.  I know the easy answer is to leave him, but I feel like I've invested so much time and energy into this relationship.  I know he has issues with poor self esteem so I kind of feel bad just leaving without trying to work through this with him.  I feel like I owe it to him to try and help him through his issues.  How do I determine if I should leave it or try to save it?  I just don’t think there’s any trust left.  I just feel like I gave him a second chance before – if I give him another chance this time, who’s to say he won’t do it again?

20090205090755AAIGbcV	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Question for college aged males?	theres this guy im "friends" with. We ve hooked up in the past multiple times and agreed to stop because it may damage our bond as friends because we had been miscommunicating when we were "hooking up" about our feelings toward each other.      anyway, we were both away for a few weeks, an now that we're around each other again, people have told me it appears that he is re- interested.      He stops me and talks to me, comes by to ask to borrow things. One night when i was out with friends, we bumped into each other when i was intoxicated. we held hands briefly and then sat and talked for about an hour. He never made any sexual advance toward me when we had been drinking, which was usually when he was feeling most brave. So that makes me think he just wants friends, but does he in fact, want to be with me again?

Last night my fiance and I were playing an online game together (he's a gamer geek and convinced me to play the Xbox 360 - even though I HATE the system) anyway... we were using our headsets and one of the guys we were playing with asked if I was a MAN.  I said NO because obviously I'm not - and my fiance just started laughing!!  I told the two men who we were playing with that I've had surgey on my throat twice (once for a normal procedure and again because my ex husband crushed my voice cords during a domestic marriage) ALL THREE OF THEM JUST LAUGHED AT ME!!!  Even my fiancee!!!      I got very upset and kinda laid into my fiance about it... and what did he do?  Added the two men as friends on his friends list...      I'm hurt - not only because he was laughing at me but because he didnt stand up for me - and because it brings back bad memmories with my ex husband...      I dont know... am I over-reacting?

20090205092941AAv9pzf	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Why are some people stuck on tradition when they don't make sense anymore in this day and age?	And they tell you are delusional when you tell them why something doesn't work?      For example:    Tradition says to save your top tier of cake. What people don't realize or care is that tradition comes from the British who used (and still do) fruitcake as the wedding cake that was made with ingredients that were intended to last a year or more in the freezer. The ingredients that American cakes are made with are not intended to be frozen that long, thus people get sick when they eat their top tier that is thawed and they don't find it edible. And why many bakers these days are offering free cake on the first anniversary that is fresh.

20090205091253AAE1Ro2	Family & Relationships;Family	I'm sick of my family (my uncle hates me!)?	It all started when my boyfriend came over for the first time to meet my (extended) family for a party. My boyfriend (who can sometimes act like a tough guy) said something to my uncle like "and who are you?". I know for a fact he never meant it to be mean, but my uncle took it the wrong way and ever since he completely dislikes my boyfriend, and because he hates him, he has turned against me too! I do kind of wish that at the time that I could've explained to him that he didn't mean it like that, but I doubt it would've done any good, anyways. My family is full of people with bad tempers (which could definitely be proven with some of the fights, both physical and verbal, that have occurred in our family history), and my uncle is--well--let's say he doesn't have too much of a 'sensitive' side. He does drink a lot and even at funerals he acts rather inappropriately without showing really any sort of emotion or sympathy at all. He even hardly bothers with his son from a previous marriage, maybe calling him every once and a while I guess.    But the thing is he used to be my favorite uncle- until my boyfriend came along. Now he hates both me and him-- and it hurts to see him talk to my sister and brother, but he barely says a word to me! I have gone through a lot of **** in my life, and I feel like I am being punished even more because of this. It's like now I try to avoid as much as possible to avoid going to family parties if I know he's going to be there. I don't want to avoid my family entirely, but because of him, I feel like I have no choice. And talking to him about it is out of the question, as there is no way in hell that will help at all because of the way he is.    I don't even know what I'm looking for by writing this-- I guess I just had to get this out. It's like sometimes I feel like I have no choice but to hope my family disowns me or that I have to disown them, just because of my uncle! :(
20090205091251AAQuHIB	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Thank you's for wedding gifts?	I was wondering how do you handle thank you cards after a shower that was thrown for you at work by your co-workers?  Normally when friends and family send gifts, you mail out your thank you's asap, but do you do the same thing after an at-work shower?  Am I supposed to go around and ask for everyone's mailing address?  Hand out cards around the office?  One general card to everyone with all their names on it and give it to the boss?  What do you suggest?  Thanks!

20090205092115AAzR8Wy	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Emotional dependency or love for a person?	When I wake up and before I sleep, I think of him.      Whenever I hear any love songs/break up songs, it reminds me of him.      When I feel or see something happy, I wish he's beside me now.      If he's sick/sad or lonely, I'll always be there for him.      I will do his laundry, iron his cloth, can learn how to cook ( just for him )      He just keep lingers on my mind 24/7.      I'll do anything to make him life comfortable.      I do get angry for his nasty habits ( getting drunk ) but I still accept for what he is.      He digs his nose and fart in front of me, I still love him.      I keep reading his IM messages, SMS es over and over again.      The thoughts of him makes me happy and hurt sometimes.      What he said is always very important to me.      Always looking forward to see him or talk to him.      Seeing him sleeping beside me makes me contented.      Likes doing things for him, just for him.      Likes to tidy up his room.            Is this real love for a person?      WE been together for 1 year and 4 months.

20090205093632AAAL0fM	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	My Marriage feels abusive.  Is it? or am I too sensitive?	I have been married I thought happily for over 16 yrs.  We have 3 children together and a son (24) to my first marriage which was very abusive physically.  My husband now never strikes me but he seems a little abusive mentally.        He drinks every night but at home and never really goes out to bars so I am thankful for that.  However, he acts as though I am not good enough for him.  For instance, sometimes in front of his family especially he will insult me.  One time I commented on how beautiful his sisiters baby was.  I said we, meaning me and my husband could not have anymore children.  He quickly interupted and said he still could.  That is because I had a tubal litigation.  He refused to get fixed which is fine.  He also puts me down.  He compares me to women at his office.  He said Jess was so smart and he knows how hard it is to work full time and go to law school.  I asked if Jess had any kids.  He replied no she is 25 and lives at home.  I reminded him how hard RN school was while raising 4 kida, one with autism.  He said yes but that is different.  I asked how and he replied it was manual labor and he could not help it I did not get an education.  I was very hurt.  Many times these comments come unprovoked .  Last Thanksgiving we were at his familys house when I suggested that his younger sisiter If she lived closer could be hired to take care of oiur autistic daughter so I could work more.  He replied I could not even handle my job now.  I was offended and stated how I also cyber school my autistic daughter.  He replied what is so hard about it.  One of his family members giggled to his comment.  Is this verbal abuse or not?         There are many other issues as well.  He flirts at every oppurtunity in front of me.  I am very attractive 5'3 and 115lbs. and I never do this to him.  Last vacation there was a woman celebrating her divorce that we met.  She was bragging about being with a married man the night before.  Anyway the next night my kids and I are were down at the beach when he starts flirting with her right in front of us.  He asked her questions about if she ever went topless.  My 13 yr old daughter wrote in her diary how she did not want to remember that vacation.  I still am deeply hurt and i am losing trust.  He works at a bank and is a negotiater.  He tried to tell me last New Years eve he may have to work late.  I asked how late and he said maybe as late as midnight.  I laughed and said he was lying and threatened a PI.  He came home about 6 that evening.  No surprise there.  In our first yr of marriage we seperated and he had an affair with a married woman.  He says only one time although I have my suspicians to this as well.       He also insists on seeing my pay stub but never shows me his.  he wants full control of the money and used to demand my whole pay.  Is this how mrriage really is??   .
20090205091730AArK0UA	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Already Asked But; Should I be angry?	My fiance and I have a generally good relationship. As of late we have been going through things (my ill health including back problems, UTI's and resulting miscarriage, which has made it so he has to take care of me.) As of Sunday my fiance has become overly friendly with my roommate/ Best friend. She use to not touch him at all but now they hug and she refers to him as her "cuddle buddy" also monday he spent all day cuddling in her bed and only came to me for sex, and to shower with me. She has been hugging him a lot lately and he lying in her bed. She is now getting involved in our couple talks as well as seemingly making decisions for him (ex. he got sick at my house and we decided to take him to the hospital, I left the room for 5 mins and all of the sudden they had totally changed hospital plans, to ones that excluded me and then when they thought it was something serious she told me not to come to the hospital that I would not be let in!) She also is now saying "I love him too!" I explained to him that this makes me uncomfortable and he basically told me i was being jealous and not trusting him, that she is just opening up to him.He says I should know he loves me by all he has done for me. But they have been staying up all night talking and such (something we use to do.) This has caused a lot of fighting because i feel uncomfortable, and he is blaming me for the fighting and telling me that I am changing. Am I being jealous or is he out of line?

20090205091005AAyit5l	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	So there's only one problem...?	Okay so here's the jist with a little more detail. Me and my ex of 5 years met at my families skating rink. Where she now works. Now i'm only 20 but that's 1/4 of my life. I got a new girl about 2 months after me and my ex broke up. Last weekend we went skating. My ex wasn't working however she did decide to go skating. CRAP! so here we are skating and she just leaves half way through everything. The next day she was workin and crying to my aunt. Literally crying. What do I do with the new girl? My Ex? I obviously still love her. It ended in september. Her facebook changed from friendship to dating after that weekend. But i know alot of you say talk to her.... She won't answer my calls, my texts or even emails. I've tried for 3 months to contact her. But i got one response. and that was school related. haha. but how do i get her to sit down and talk to me? we built a house together we got a dog. I mean i don't know what to do, that's why i'm here.

20090205091620AAYIc8k	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I know this is super long, but I could really use some good advice!!!!!?	My boyfriend and I have been dating for almost 8 years now.  We've had our ups and downs like every relationship - sometimes we have a blast together and sometimes we dislike each other.  I've currently run into a situation regarding my relationship and I'm having a difficult time making a decision and could really use some good advice...      Some important background information is necessary.  So about five years ago or three years into the relationship, I found inappropriate conversations and e-mails trying to meet up with people that he had met in online chat rooms.  I confronted him, multiple times, about all the things I found and he denied it was him at first, and then he promised never to do it again.  He told me it was an outlet in which he could be himself without being judged.  Ok, his mistake, maybe he had a hard time opening up intimately – I understand it’s difficult to trust people in that way.  I know he loved me and would never actually go through with it, so I took his word and moved on.      Fast-forward to present time - eight years into our relationship or five years since the previously discussed scandal.  I found him searching craigslist erotic services for all types of **** - men, women, trannies, orgies, etc.  He's even gone so far as to respond to a few ads while I was at work seeing if he could meet up with these people.  I don't have any evidence implying that he's actually met up with anyone or not.  I’ve been monitoring his actions for the past few months and he’s still browsing every once in a while.  I know I have to confront him, but I feel like I need more hard evidence so he can’t lie to my face.  I also feel like I need more hard evidence to justify my leaving the relationships.  I’m just not sure what evidence I am looking for or when I’ll get enough evidence to make a decision.        I've tried to get him to talk about any possible fantasies he might have and try to get him to open up sexually to me, but he never mentions any crazy things he wants to try.  I mean, we probably have as much sex as every other healthy couple, so it's not like he's deprived.  He JUST recently (in the past six months or so) opened up and started talking about masturbating, but only because I pressed the issue.          I am furious and upset and am not sure what to do.  I know the easy answer is to leave him, but I feel like I've invested so much time and energy into this relationship.  I know he has issues with poor self esteem so I kind of feel bad just leaving without trying to work through this with him.  I feel like I owe it to him to try and help him through his issues.  How do I determine if I should leave it or try to save it?  I just don’t think there’s any trust left.  I just feel like I gave him a second chance before – if I give him another chance this time, who’s to say he won’t do it again?

20090205091350AAJyzdJ	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Cheating spouse who cheated with best friend and then took my kids to her house after he said he wouldn't do i?	I was married for 10yrs(almost 11) My marriage has had it problems but we have worked thru them. I moved out of the house with my kids 3yrs ago, but came back and things where really going in a good direction for us.     Roughly 8mnths ago I started feeling insecure with the way he would treat my bestfriend (his bestfriends wife also). I told them both this and it never changed. It got worse. I found they were text msg each other, but they both said that they were talking about her and her husband fighting and she wants his advise. I still felt weird about everything so I asked him for a copy of his cell bill to prove he wasn't doing it anymore. Well that never happend. I begged him for months for a copy... things just kept getting bad and he was doing things he hadn't done before. Same as her. So when he told me he was done dealing with it all and wasn't going to talk about it anymore... Mind you without trying to prove to me nothing was going on, I filed for divorce. We still lived in the same house together with our kids. A few weeks after I filed he was helping his friend move her stuff out of their house because they are also getting divorced now... that next day her husband goes to take some more of her stuff to her new house and finds his truck at her house. Garage door open, door to house unlocked so he walked in and caught them literally in the act. All my husband can say to me was, Yes i finally did it.. if I am going to get accused of it, I am going to do it. He says it was the first time, however the night before when my husband was sitting at the bar with her husband, she text my hubby and said.. dam baby I luv you and miss you.    I have now moved out with my kids, however I found out two days ago that when they where with their dad this past weekend he took them to her house and then made them promise to "keep their mouths shut and not tell me because I would hate him". My kids where so upset that they couldn't tell me.. they feel better now, but now are so scared of him finding out they told me.

20090205091530AAqUgNH	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My boyfriend keeps talking about his ex girlfriends and in a sexual way?	Please help. I have been with someone for a month now. He is 46 im 33. Well he already is showing signs of not trusting me, or beleiving a word i say. I would not disrespect him. Well im getting sick and tired of him talking about ex girlfriends even down to what he done sexually to them. He also keeps telling me  that he  22 year old girls keep chatting him up, and asking me why do younger girls want to be with him when he is old enough to be their father. I finally snapped at him last night and said im fed up with him talking about other women. He then blamed me for everything saying i was aggresive and not the person he thought i was. I raised my voice a bit thats all. I felt they are hurtfull things to say. What should i do? And do lots of young girls fancy men old enough to be their father.Its a few times he keeps talking about this. Thanks for any advice
20090205091629AA1pRwp	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What should I do for valentines?	I've been going out with my g/f for about 3 months, but in those 3 months it was her birthday and Christmas, for her birthday I made her a romantic dinner and on Christmas I gave her a couple of movies and a flip camera. I know she doesn't like jewelry that much, and has told me before that she doesn't use any sort of necklace or rings or bracelets, and I have only seen her wear earrings a handful of times. I have no clue what to get her on valentines, we will probably be going out to dinner and I will be getting her some flowers and a card but I want to give her a nice gift and have no clue what to do. Any tips/advice?

I have to admit that I’ve always had a thing for sexy female feet for as long as I can remember.  I have been very fortunate to date two women—one was my ex-fiancé, who had truly gorgeous feet.  Since they cared about me, they were willing to satisfy me.  However, that was a long time ago, and I now doubt if I will be able to find such women again…Do you think I still have a chance?
20090205092320AAfqmTw	Family & Relationships;Friends	Blasting enough dynamite topples a house. Sending enough mutual friends topples a grudge. Right?	Say I tried talking to her to resolve some mistake and/or misunderstanding. She doesn't give me a chance to resolve it with her myself.      Then I send a mutual friend, and apparently the mutual friend doesn't have enough influence with her, so s/he either makes her grudge worse, or doesn't manage to bring us any closer to getting her grudge resolved.      So what about sending more mutual friends one after another until her grudge finally ends?      After all, if blasting enough dynamite can demolish a house, why wouldn't sending enough mutual friends to mediate and solve, demolish her grudge?

20090205092439AAQKGyq	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	She needs time apart to think...But im starting to do some thinking of my own?	With Valentines day just around the corner, this could very well be the worse time to call it quits between me and my girl. Well here's the situation. I messed up. Not from cheating or anything like that, but because I wanted to break up with her before due to our constant arguments. Then I apologized to her and now the ball is in her court. With over a week of not seeing each other, Im starting to think that maybe I don't wanna get back with her. Im at the age where I'm ready to settle down...It doesn't seem like she is, but she told me before she is. She doesn't know it but she's actually making it worse by not contacting me. Should I continue to give her time to think or should I just throw in the towel?? Yes Valentines day is around the corner but what is an ideal time for someone to think over things? 2-3 weeks the most? Its been a week already...

20090205092956AAL0ABY	Family & Relationships;Family	Im rootin for the Dugger family!?	Its about time someone raised their kids with great morals & a stay at home mom. Back in the old days (50's and earlier) there was no TV, no PC's,  & moms stayed home, and kids were way better behaved than they are now. Drugs were not brought home, kids were tucked into bed by mom or dad not some sitter, and divorces were waaaayyyy less. Mom's aren't home to wipe their babies from a fall or bad day at school, parents don't care if their daughters date at 14,  parents don't care if their kids watch PG-13 & R rated movies, parents don't care if their kids watch Will & Grace, parents don't care if they watch Baywatch where it sends messages to your girls that if you don't have DD boobs and less is more to attract guys then why not, instead of being yourself, watching 'Friends' to see who goes to bed with who, and all those other 'girlfriend' shows where they all bed hop from one boyfriend to the other, and parents who let their kids dress like street walkers.........I say the Duggers are right on, and its about time!! All of you with young kids that say 'fooey' to this, well, wait till they get in highschool and say 'mom Im pregnant'. I have 3 kids and I thank God they are moral and good. I didn't have all the rules the Duggers have (they could go to dances if it was chaperoned, but not private parties), and were raised in a good Christian home with no drinking, drugs, fighting, and the like. We are a normal family and raised our kids to put God first and we also were very strick on what TV they watched. It worked, and they are productive good happily married moral adults with great jobs. I do want to note that I know some mom's have to work because of no husband, or a husband that is laid off or injured. Mom's who have a husband who provides to where the mom does not have to work but does anyway,  causes her to have a babysitter thats with them more hours than she is, is missing out big time on her childrens lives and activities, and can't be home "every time" they are sick. Your kids don't have a mom, they have a babysitter or day care that is raising them. In my book, if you are home by 5pm Mon-Fri, your sitter is raising your kids, your not. Your a part time parent, the sitter is the full timer (almost).

I am completely sure that i never want to be more than friends with him although he is romantically interested in me. He says he is aware of my feelings on the subject and we have agreed to be just friends.Reccently our relationship has become alot more physical. not sexual at all. but we hug and he holds me in his arms alot. the other day we lay on his bed and cuddled for an hour. i think sometimes that i wouldn't mind kissing him and i think it may lead on to that. but i am still sure that i don't want a relationship. what should i do?
20090205093339AAU6mO9	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do I deal with this situation?	I really can't stand my roommate. Her boyfriend lives down the hall but "lives" in our room except to sleep. They have no other friends aside from each other and are in the room 24/7 when not in class.They don't even leave the room to eat!!!      They are always under the covers together cuddling and fooling around and it makes me very uncomfortable. I even had to change in front of this guy...until I put my foot down and told him he had to step outside when I was changing.      I'm NEVER in the room due to the fact that I'm so uncomfortable. I feel as if I'm smothering my boyfriend because I'm constantly at his place or in the computer lab studying.       Sunday I was gone from 2PM - 9PM and I asked my roommate if my boyfriend & I could use the room alone.She gave me an attitude and told me to go find somewhere else to be alone. She then told me she would give me 5 min. timed because that's all she thinks my boyfriend could last in bed.      She told me that this was her room too and to get over it. She then told me she saw my boyfriend as a piece of a** and wishes she knew how long he could last in bed.      Now, she's trying to be my friend. She "claims" she doesn't want any drama. And I am currently trying to deal with this situation. Even after telling her a million times how uncomfortable I am with her boyfriend being there they continue to hang out in our room all the time. She's totally disrespectful.      There have been nights where I just leave crying because I'm so irritated with seeing those two.      How do I deal with this situation??   Note: Housing will not let me move out!!!! I have spoken to them about this numerous times.      I don't want to be her friend   even though she wants to be mine   is that wrong??

20090205095122AAxiubH	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How long until he forgives me?	Long story short my husband and I were having a terrible argument last saturday and he was talking about divorce.  He couldn't say one nice thing about me so to try to get him to change his focus I asked him to say something I did right.  He said I take good care of our daughter and pay the bills on time.  It really hurt that he couldn't say one thing I did right FOR HIM.  So I responded with "what about when we make love."  And he said "what about it?"  I asked him didn't I do something every time that was right, since he's always praising me about giving him "lots of attention and spoiling him ;)"  He stared blankly at me and I blurted out "I s$#@ your (insert colorful expression for male genetalia here).  Now 5 days later he's still angry and holding a grudge!! I didn't say it to be mean, I guess I said it to make me feel better because I do alot of things well in our marriage.   Now he won't even talk about being intimate and I am afraid the longer we go without making love the more damage it will do, bitterness and all that!  Is there anything I can do to make it right?

20090205095134AANkiv5	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What is going thru his head?	I am not trying to be mean just state facts and get the rational behind this, I broke up w/ my fiance, which was a big mistake he has started "dating" this girl who is overweight, works at a disgusting bar, and isn't particuarly pretty and also drinks. This is not his type whatsoever, he has always his entire life dated normal-thin type girls, who are well groomed and attractive. I am not saying there is anything wrong w/ bigger girls, but he has always not found them attractive and said negative things about them. Also the extent of their "relationship" apparently is him going out to this bar while she bartends and I am assuming getting free drinks. Meanwhile he tells me that he still is in love w/ me, although we are not back together, and that he is very "confused" as to what to do.

20090205094557AAFi8oi	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why should I keep dating her? Should I at all?	We were good friends, I asked if she'd be ok if we started dating and she said sure.  We went on two awesome dates, I asked if she'd be interested in making it a relationship, she said not yet.  She told me she really really liked me and wanted to keep dating, but then she basically ignored me for 2 1/2 weeks.  In the first week I sent her 4 text messages and tried to IM her twice, all on separate days, but she never responded.  She sent me 1 text asking how classes went, and ignored my response of 'good, yours?'  After this I stopped trying to talk to her assuming she wasn't interested  (I was going to talk to her after a month to let her know we were still friends but weren't going to date anymore).      The problem is she has started talking to me again, posting on my FB wall and IM'ing me like she used to... which I noticed started happening AFTER I had my best friend (a girl) come visit and stay at my place for 3 days.  Do I keep trying to date her?  Or is she suddenly interested in me again because she thinks there's competition?

I had an ad on match and for the first few months, I received many replies and never had to initiate contact.  I went on many dates during the first few months but it seemed that there weren't very many new members and my responses slowed down as one would expect.  I quit match and joined yahoo personals and have been a member for a month.  I have gotten over 500 views and only about 80 contacts.  I have met 2 people out of that and one was looking for sex on the first date and the other lived too far away to make dating practical.  I am now initiating contact ,which is not something I like to do but I haven't a choice since no one hardly responds to me and still only 1 out of 30 answers back, the rest just don't respond at all.  I am using the same ad and picures (I still look the same) that got my many replies on the other site the first few months.  Is it that yahoo just has a large number of nonmembers that can't reply or are the men on it extra rude?

He went back to school and  his female lab partner wanted to stay in touch.They exchanged e mail  about every other month.Her  idea she wanted to see how the nursing program was going for him.He didnt tell me he says iam controlling and jealouse so why tell wasnt important.It was all about school.He did meet her when i was at work and sold her a book in the parking lot at wegmans.She  also invited him to a pampered chef party and meet her at her work for lunch there were labs there she wanted to show him this was all in about a years time.HE never did respond to these request.He did tell her one time they could maybe grab abite to eat when he didnt feel like answering her e mail questions about his nursing clinicals .Told me didnt want to write a essay he is not big on e mailing.So what do yo u think  of this ?He only said about a bite to eat to get her from asking  more questions he never had intentions.He never did do this.I Did speak with her she  says she is happily married wouldnt she refer to him as a friend he called her a classmate.

So there's this guy in my media studies and he's so gorgeous I've liked him for almost a year I just can't help myself it distracts me from work and I just want him sooo badly but he doesn't seem to notice me and I'm shy, what can I do?
20090205094430AAZza0k	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Do you think getting married in college helps or hurts school work?	I think it helps, because you're not distracted with other guys, or worrying much about what you look like, or going out all the time and you can focus on your school work, and you don't end up having sex with a bunch more guys before you get married. I think it's a great thing, but so far, I've only found one older adult in my life who agrees with me (And she got married in college, and is now 60 and still married, so she knows what she's talking about). What does anyone else think?

20090205074542AAq3kv9	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	He cheated on me, and now hes with her?	I've been seeing this guy the last 3 months. After we slept together he started getting really weird and distant saying we were just friends but then hed get confused and jealous if i went out and say we were together. Then because i was mad at the way he was treating me he started calling me "crazy" and that i should go to the doctor. The other day i was talking to him and he said he had been on a date all weekend. I didnt beleive him and shrugged it off but then he called me the next day and he told me he had been seeing someone else and that i needed to get on with things. He says he really likes her.That took me right off guard. and apparantly in the last month we had been still seeing eachother, hed been cheating on me with this other girl. I was curious about him saying this and didnt believe it so i talked to his sister whom i went to highschool with. Apparantly hes had a history of this and he cheats chronically on girls. and leaves them for the next. Now im hearing about how much he likes this new girl from a mutual friend..and how shes working at some church or something. Do u think he really likes her that much and doesnt miss me at all? I thought we had something different.....I'm just scared hes going to treat this new girl much better.

20081023160246AAM362n	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What to do when I think she's flirting with my boyfriend?	My boyfriend and I have been dating for two years and we live together. For the past month a college classmate of his has been texting him multiple times a day, and has made comments that, in my opinion, seem to show that she is blatantly flirting with him. A few other people who know her also think she's flirting with him. I told my boyfriend about it, and he asked her, but she denied it. He stands by her, and says they're just friends. I know my boyfriend won't cheat on me, but I think it's annoying (and insulting) for her to keep up her attitude. She texts him in the mornings telling him to "wake up" and until recently texted him at 1 AM, and she's gone around asking friends if we're happy together.      I need someone's opinion from outside. I'm getting irritated with my boyfriend because he lets it happen and won't see what's going on. Should I just drop it, or tell him he needs to make her stop?

20081020073953AALKFUs	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Are we dating?  When are you considered to be dating?	I met this guy on Saturday through an online dating website.  At first he said he was looking for friends, but as of yesterday he has changed it to looking for dating.  So, it makes me wonder now – are we dating?      On Saturday we started chatting through msn and decided to meet to have a few drinks at a local quiet tavern.  We were drinking and occasionally going out for a smoke. After about 2 hours, we were outside and he said he was confused as he didn’t know whether to lean in or stay back.  Well I told him to lean in and we kissed.  Long story short, that night I went back to his place.  We had sex 5 times and he insisted on cuddling the whole night through.  We also did a lot of kissing.  The next day, I expected that I was going to be leaving soon.  Instead, he asked me to hang out with him and his buddy for a bit and then we went for coffee.  He then walked me part of the way home.  He said that we should exchange phone numbers.      Later (yesterday) we chatted through msn on and off through the night.  We made some plans for tonight, he is going to be coming over to my place for a while and perhaps stay overnight.  He told me that his trouser snake seemed to like me a lot.  LOL! Anyways, a little later we were talking and he asked me if I wanted to do anything last night.  He suggested we go for coffee, talk, and perhaps have coital endeavours (sex).  So I picked him up in my van and we went through the drive-thru.  We got to a quiet spot and he grabbed my hand and played with my fingers.  We sat there talking and drinking our coffees and having a smoke.  Then he kissed me over and over on my lips, cheeks, chin, neck, and nose.  I suggested we move to the back of my van and we did.  Once we were back there he kissed me again all over and we ended up having sex again.  He asked, like he had done a few times the night before, if we could take it slow.  So we did and kissed a lot during it.  When I dropped him off we talked for a few minutes and then he leaned into kiss me goodbye.  Again it was not a simple kiss, but rather a series of kisses that lasted well over a minute.  He said he would see and talk to me soon and then kissed me again.      So that is where it’s at…  I am just wondering how many times do you have to go out to be considered dating?  I have had **** buddies in the past, but this seems different.  I can’t remember the last time so much time with someone I just met.  In 24 hours we were together for 16 hours and then again for 2 hours.  And then tonight, we may be together the whole night again.  Also of importance for knowing soon enough is on Wednesday I have to go away for a week and a half.  I don’t want to go picking up some guy over there, or is it allowed if we are not exclusive?  Ack!  I’m confused!

20060927143919AAO9eo3	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do you get a guy you like to notice you?	I know this sounds like the normal cliche question, but I'm serious. I'm shy around guys when I like them, whenever I try to impress a guy or act normal around them, I end up doing somethin embarrassing or stupid, and I'm cute (not to sound conceited or anything, don't get me wrong! I don't do conceit.) but I'm not exactly one of the "hottie" type girls or whatever that every guy in my school seems to go for. And another thing is, not to turn this into a race thing or anything, but I'm African-American/ Puerto Rican, and I go to a mainly white school, with only about 12 blacks, and a few foreign students. It seems that all the guys in our school have no interest in the minority girls except for as friends, because most of the caucasian girls have the guys' attention, and the african americans aren't that big of a deal. I'm not saying that our school is racist, but I really really like this guy, and I want a Christian guy, since I'm Christian and he is too, so please help me!

20090205094952AATuJCy	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	If people ignore you does that really hurt your feelings?	It does for me because it feels like I'm not wanted. It's upsetting when you say hello to someone you made friends with on myspace and they don't even say hi back. They read your message but they don't reply. It's very rude, disrespectful and upsetting.   Loads of people on myspace are getting very sad because they don't get replies.   I usually do get replies from my friends but when I don't, it gets upsetting and makes me feel isolated.    I would much rather have an answer than no answer at all.   If people don't want to be distracted or they don't want to talk then it's better to say it to their faces rather than ignore them. That way they'll know and won't bother them anymore. Ignoring makes the situation worse because you get people flaming and nagging at you. I don't do that at all because it could ruin the friendship. Even though I feel slightly annoyed I don't show it or try not to.   Anyone felt the same way?

20090205094129AAHsdER	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should i chase this guy?	I am always the one that is being chased. Guys would call me all of the time and they would be the ones to set up the dates and I have never had to the work, but I have now been dating this new guy that says he likes me and is interested and that we are in a relationship; we barely see eachother cause hes so busy, but I don't call him and he doesn't call me and its almost like a game that we play to see who calls first. Should I just give in and start chasing him?

20090205074838AAiD6Iy	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What's my problem with guys?	I get a boyfriend that i liked allot but then, well i just can't spend time with him i make up excuses to not hang out and barley talk to him.    I have  a huge phobea of talking to guys on the phone . Unless he's a close friend or i'm at a friends house. I can't even hang out with my boyfriend alone!    what's wrong with me!?    i like them but then when i actually start dating them my feeling are confusing. and so i end it usually over msn. Shallow? i know.    I  feel so bad doing it but whenever i decide i want to get into a real relationship my feelings take over and i can't handle it.    My first boyfriend and i were close. So when he ended it for no reason it hurt allot.    Am i just afraid to get close again? or am i being a total nervous breakdown?    What should i do?
20090205074435AAt9Wxx	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is this sad and a turn off to women?	...that i have never managed to get a girlfriend and im 23.      I get the impression so far that as you get older people find this strange and run a mile from you thinking something is wrong with me, making it even harder to get one in the first place.      It gets me very depressed and plays on my mind all day, especially when you go outside and see happy couples and relationships on TV, books, papers and in everything you do.      I feel i may die alone and its too late for me now due to lack of experience i should i had when i was younger and the social skills i also should have developed which has took a beating on my confidence and self-esteem. That is the scariest part : (
20090205081934AAK1RtK	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	HEEELPPP What should I do?	So I this boy and I have been going out for a month or so but I have never met him. He doesnt have a phone. Everytime he is at his cousins house (the cousin goes to my school) he calls me which is like at least 3 times a week. Hes a sweet boy and he says he loves me. I'm just so confused because i have never met him and i really wanna see him. I just dont know how. Like, i just dont know how to convince him or get him to come see me without saying it. IS this realtionship good or should I end it? I'm scared tto let him go because hes a great guy but i dont think i can go on not seeing him much longer...
20090205094406AAuvY0x	Family & Relationships;Family	Why do parents make us feel like crap or have a way with guilt?	Im just upset with my father b/c he is making me feel so much guilt b/c the tenant below me is leaving. Im actually relieved they are leaving b/c they are heavy smokers and i live upstairs with two small children.  These people knew this was a smoke free complex but yet continued to smoke. They cut down but they still smoke heavily at night.  Its horrible.  But my father loved the fact they are clean and pay the rent and they have a history of staying for long time.  To make a long story short, we were all getting along until the tenants went on a trip and had their two sisters stay over. They smoked like chimneys and no matter how many times i called them to ask them to smoke outside they kept denying they were smoking. One day i lost my cool and told them off and my mother also called them and told them they woud have to leave if they didnt smoke outside.  When the tenant came back from her trip, she was so angry with me (for telling off her sister about the smoke) that she stopped talking to me and my parents.  Now a month later, they are moving out and i was actually quiete relieved.  But my father is upset with me blaming me for their departure and even made a comment that im the reason why people do not stay longer than two years in this place.  I was very hurt.  I have never bothered anyone untll now b/c of the serious smoking problem. Before that the other tenants left b/c they have families and bought homes.  I tried to explain to my father that people do not plan on living in an apartment forever and that most young people move out eventually.  I think its wrong that he blames me for people wanting to leave.  He's just upset that he has to keep renting out the place and putting money into it all the time.        What do you think i should do?  Ive offered to help out my parents by trying to find good people to live here. Im putting in ads and making calls.  Im even getting a lease kit for them b/c they dont speak good english and just let anyone live here.        What should i do about my father?  I feel so hurt by his nasty comments and i feel very belittled.
20090205080317AAepWfQ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Am I over Reacting or what?	okay, so when i fell asleep last nite i was lying next to my bf, when i woke up at 3 in the morning, i was cold and alone, the house was dark and the car downstairs was gone, i waited for about a half an hour, then i called him. He was a total jerk to me on the phone when i asked why he just left without saying a word, and he said he had to go to his step brothers and that if he woke me up i would start a fight, so when he got home, i was crying which turned into a huge fight, he made me feel like it was my fault that he didnt say he was leaving, i just feel so disrespected and betrayed...am i over reacting?

20090205095624AAtGiLo	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I can't stop thinking about her, what should I do?	It's been two year since I've broken up with this girl but I can't get her out of my head. We don't even talk anymore, but she still keeps popping up in my thoughts. I know she's moved on and its been 8 months since we last talked so I've let go of it all but everyday she's on my mind...not constantly just randomly. I've kind of dated other girls but non seem to really affect my feelings.  She was the best kiss I ever had and I still feel like if we had time to start over things would be a lot better but I'm not attempting to pursue her anymore. I'm at an engineering school now so there aren't that many girls, but I'm really trying to find someone that just completely blows my memory of her away. I know someone's gonna post just move on and get over it but that's what I'm doing. I just can't forget her. We broke up for stupid reasons and I at the time was not informed on how to really have a relationship. It was just a lot of stupid stuff.

But during the pregnancy he would go out, and turn of his cell phone so I couldn't call him. He would come home say he was sorry, that he didn't meen it he was just drunk and not thinking. Then the night I went into labour, he was out again after I asked him not too. I called the bar and said I was having bad contractions. He hung up the phone and said that I just wanted him to come home and was making it up. He got home at 2:30, my water broke at 3:00 ! I don't think I can ever forgive him for this. He says he sorry and he will regret that forever. but do I believe him? he has said this before. Can he truly love me if he has done all this, I would never hurt him or anyone in that way. please help!!

Well we are friends since 6th grade (im in 9th now) she left at the end of 8th and well at the very end of 8th when she was about to leave i began liking her. Slowly i have hinted that i liked her and said things like that i'd make out with her and such. She might visit sometime this year so im looking forward to it, we joke around that we will make out when she arrives and stuff. We always end our msn convos sayin how much we love each other (i love you, etc) and well im not sure if she likes me back but i really like her now. She calls me love and well we really like each other but i dunno if she likes me as a friend. Should i go for it? If i do, how should i do it? I used to always think she was hot before we became friends but now im just in love with her. How can i find out without asking if thats what it comes down to? Think it will ruin our friendship?

He said they could still talk and stuff, but he didnt talk to her at all. She called and asked why, but he hung up on her. She balled for like a half hour after that. She sent him a text, but she wont tell me what it said. I think it was slutty or something, bcuz she said "He'll talk to me after this". She thinks he wanted to break up with her in the first place, because she wouldn't have sex with him. I keep telling her that he isn't right for her, but she always says "You guys don't get it, I LOVE HIM" She's 15, she cant be IN LOVE! Can she!?!?!

20080528023020AAVJZ9g	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	New Patchworkfamily.... *Puh*... Hilfe!!!?	Hallo Zusammen!     Meine Kinder und ich sind mit meinem Freund endlich nach drei Jahren Wochenendbeziehung zusammen gezogen. Jetzt ist das ein halbes Jahr her und es kracht gewaltig.     Ihm ist alles zu viel glaub ich. Er hat noch mit 28 bei seinen Eltern gewohnt und soll jetzt Familienvater spielen. (Krass ausgedrckt) Es ist fr uns alle nicht einfach, wir mssen uns alle auf einander einstellen. Aber jetzt resegniert er und zieht sich schon seit Tagen ins Schlafzimmer zurck. ( Vor den Fernseher, so wie bei Mama frher). Und wenn er mal raus kommt, l?sst er nur seine schlechte Laune an uns aus.     Mit den Kindern habe ich darber gesprochen, sie wollen nicht das er wieder auszieht. Sie sagten es w?re schon sch?n mit ihm, nur im Moment finden sie ihn gemein. Was ich auch gut verstehen kann.     Was ratet ihr mir? Soll ich ihn einfach in Ruhe lassen, ihm ein paar Tage zum  Luft holen geben? Oder doch lieber gleich wieder miteinbeziehen, obwohl es jedes mal Streit gibt?     Liebe Gr?e   Dani

20081123031333AAebHCt	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Venting about a fading engagement...?	Is it wrong to wish I were someone else. To divide myself in half so as to leave what others need of me behind and venture out to start a new version of me. I'm growing very weary of who I am today.   I fell in love with the most gorgeous creature on the planet. Charming, handsome, charismatic, nurturing person I have ever laid my soul's ear to. My world was tinted in a rose color, everything was delightful. Then he took all of that away from me in an instant. I was hurt but repaired my wounds as best I could without losing more precious moments licking my wounds. I regenerated my love almost %100 when it happened again. Of course I was damaged but could not let myself be responsible for not doing everything I could to fix it... So I pretended it was better and plastered a perfectly broken smile on and pretended like it didn't matter. He asked for my hand, and reluctantly I accepted- after convincing myself that this pattern had obviously been broken with this new commitment. Feeling like nothing could possibly come between us at this point, feeling untouchable and strong- WE (yes, both of us) decided a break would be best after a month solid of non-stop exposure to eachother... and he left... with all of his belongings (again). There was some infidelity on his behalf in order to sabatoge the relationship.   I don't feel like I matter much anymore... unwanted, a burden. I feel like the love is gone, dead. I want it back... to feel like it did before. OR I just want it over so I can be someone else now- this version is far too damaged.    Does anyone have feedback? I'd really appreciate it.

20081123042639AAhoHCc	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What is wrong with me??????	I've been with my loving, caring partner for 8 years. I have a gorgeous 20 month old son Financially, we're very comfortable. I'm very lucky in that I don't have to work and can stay home to look after my son. My partner works very long hours but still helps at home, is a devoted father, is very affectionate towards me and constantly tells me how much he loves me & how beautiful I am. Despite all of this I am very unhappy to the point where If it weren't for my son I don't think I would be able to continue living. I don't think I deserve my partner's love. I hate the way I look and it's something I think about constantly. I feel guilty for being so self-absorbed and vain. I put off sex because all I can think about is how revolting I look without makeup. How small my breasts are (i'm an a cup) and how flabby I am. I'm underweight and I've suffered from eating disorders for most of my adult life but since having my son, I feel like Jello because I now have wobbly thighs and a stomach which sticks out. I'm embarrassed to be seen without makeup because I have freckles and even though i'm only in my late 20s i have fine lines on my face. Sometimes I think that cosmetic surgery would sovle a lot of my problems but I don't think any amout of surgery woud actually make me happy. I'm so worried that my partner is repulsed by my appearance and thinks I look old. I'm very shy & I think I'm affecting my partner's social life because I'd rather stay home than go out to parties & functions with him. I think he deserves to be with someone outgoing & confident. I actually feel like I'm ruining his life and my son's life by being so introverted, pathetic.  Magazines tell me I'll never be pretty enough & that having small breasts & feckled skin means that it's not possible for anyone to find me attractive. How can I stop feeling like this & how can I feel better about myself and give my family the confident, happy mother & partner they deserve? I'm worried .that I may just give up because I don' t think I'll ever be the perfect wife or mother.

20090205095411AABZq0x	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Omg, I think it was my ex?	Over 3 years ago, I had a pretty nasty break-up with a guy. He has emailed me since then, asking for me to come back but I said heck no, I moved on. I got married and I rarely even think about him. I was on a date with my husband a few days ago. We were at the movie theater and I saw a guy who looked JUST like my ex and he was with a girl...and smoking (which my ex never did!) I couldnt tell if it was him but I tried to just avoid him. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw him looking at me. my husband and I got in line to buy tickets and this guy and his date stayed on the opposite end  of the lobby, where there werent even any open lines to buy tickets. My husband's debit card wasnt working so we had to go to the automatic ticket machine, which was RIGHT where this guy was standing. I stood right in front of the guy, right next to my husband and just tried like hell to not make eye contact! I heard the guy speak and I swear to god, it was definately my ex. Should I have ignored him like I did or should I have at least said hi? He was with that girl and I was with my husband so I didnt want it to be awkward but I felt like a B*tch for not at least saying hi to the guy. I mean, we did live together for about a year before we broke up. It was just SO wierd because he emailed me about a week before my wedding and said he still wasnt over me (which was in october) so I figured I didnt want to make a scene or make him feel wierd by even looking directly at him. Would you have just ignored him and pretended like he was a stranger or would you  have said hi?

20090205095514AAiiPLl	Family & Relationships;Friends	Potential awkward situation, what would I do?	Ok I am organising a stand-up comedy fundraiser for a local charity on Feb 27th. You give what can to get in but the suggested donation is ￡3 per person. Now my friend who wants to come says she's broke at the moment so I've said she can get in without paying (it is only a donation). But I know that she's going to be spending money at the bar. Yeah, maybe she isn't a broke as she sounds, I guessed that or maybe her priorities are just all wrong - if she can spend a fiver on drinks, surely she could have given us a bit of that money as a donation, even if it's not the whole ￡3?      How can I tell her politely that I'll be really disappointed in her if she'd rather spend money on drinks at the bar than give ￡3 to a charity? And say if my ultimation doesn't work, how can I confront her afterwards? I really don't want to let it go because it my mind what she'd di is just not on.      She's really sensitive and gets upset at the smallest things so it's not like I want to be mean to her.

So even though I don't feel he calls me enough, I still don't call him and barely text. I am not sure if he feels pressure being the one to always call.

Everything changed when we moved in together and he is totally different. He always wants to know where i am going, who i am with & how long im gonna be out. We live in New Jersey & i have to travel into New York for work. He has this idea that i am cheating on him which i am not, im not that type of person at all. He is part of a very rough crowd and i hate them. I try my hardest to stay away from them.He has a very short fuse & gets pissed with me alot but always says he loves me so much, i dont know if i believe it though. Alot of my friends live in NY so i go there on some nights out with them. The other night when he came home i was on my way out with friends and he grabbed my arm and just kept staring at me & never said anything, i told him i was just going out with my friend eventually he let me go, i got terrified & knew i needed to get away from him. I know he has a tendency to be violent as i have seen him beat a guy just for bumping into me. He shouts at me if i want to go somewhere with out him, even if the place doesn't involve him he wants to be there. Im not his property and he is starting to scare me, im only 25 i don't need to be scared. Im doing everything i can to not fall pregnant for him. Please help me with advice.   Thanks alot :)

20090205111127AAvP5Fz	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do I have to tell her it's over?	So I met her 5 months ago.  Fell for her so much.  I took her to the best restaurants in the city, skipped NFL tickets, threw away airline tickets, skipped work just to see her.  For her birthday I took her to the symphony, had a "Iron Chef" personally prepare a dinner for us, etc.  But she tells me because of religion we can never be more than friends, I tried to leave so many times, then she cries, and obsesses, and begs me to stay.    Now because she's so overwhelmed, that no one has ever been so nice to her before, she wants a break.  We talk for hours on the phone almost everyday...but most of the time I tried to plan something with her, she would cancel.  After canceling on me 3 times in a week, I hinted that this was the end, and she got very upset.  "This isn't the end of anything!  Don't say that!"      In 5 months, we had 3 breaks, the longest was a month long.  2 of the breaks I asked for, because I can't help how I feel about her.  This 2 week break, she wanted it.  It's quite obvious that nothing will happen, so why dance anymore?  Do I have to tell her it's over?  Or can I just stop picking up her calls?  Won't she get the hint?

20090205111036AA63wNp	Family & Relationships;Family	What is wrong with my step sister?	Okay first let me say i do not think that i am better than anyone i just have plans to go somewhere in life. Well my dad as three daughter ages 30,29,and28 by his wife then me by my mom im 19. Well me and the 28 year old use to be bestfriends but we had a little incident but were starting to talk again. Anyways she makes me mad because everytime where together she always throws in im pregnant (about me) and in front of people and i don't like it. I don't know why she wants me to have a baby so bad when she can have kids still. I'm not ready for kids right now im working and going to school and im loving my life right now with no children.       Another problem is that when i do have children she wants to be the godmother she also throws that in my face all the time and when i say no i don't know she gets hella mad like seriously mad. But the reason why i dont want her to be the godmother is because her and her 2 real sisters are all on welfare, have 12 kids total, who are all disrespectful, curse like crazy, are wild as hell theres no respect in their households at all what so ever, all the kids are infested with lice, and they live real dirty. Well i dont want her to be the godmother because she has nothing and i want someone that my kids can look up to, someone who can discipline my children and she cant even discipline her own. I really dont know what to do with her. Help please how do i tell her she cant be the godmother and quit saying that im pregnant.?

Say if you were on a beach, and you see a pretty body building type women walking on the beach in a bikini. Or maybe an athlete, like a female track star. Obviously they have a nice body, would you say that they are physically attractive as opposed to Kim Kardashian or Halle Berry walking in a bikini on the beach? Do you like women/men who are "physically attractive"? Why or why not?      Is there a difference between being "physically attractive and sexually attractive"? Or its all the same?

20090205095703AAM6zBs	Family & Relationships;Family	Product of Environment Or...?	Hopefully there are some dads that will answer this question but it is open to all.   I'm well passed grown but I'd like to ask this and maybe this group can answer. I grew up in a bad neighborhood. Fights and gangs somebody was almost always getting jumped. (60's term sorry) My home life wasn't much better. Both my parents were abusive and my father's philosophy was: You get into a fight you better kick his *** or I'm gonna kick yours. I better be able to tell that you put a hurt to him. Well I learned how to punch as well as how to take a punch. I also developed a high rating with firearms. By the time I was into my 20's I could match and sometimes beat my father who was a cop and my older brother who was a Marine. I developed my own thoughts and refused to allow anyone to browbeat me into their way of thinking. I'm not exactly a Republican I guess I'm what most would call a Moderate Democrat but to date there has never actually been one of those to run for higher office. So I vote Republican.   I refuse to bend I never break. I think kids are the future (an unsure one no doubt) I think bad guys should be punished and not coddled or excuses found to defend their acts. So what do you think. Am a just a product of an old forgotten environment or what?
20090205105711AAeZ4lR	Family & Relationships;Friends	I need help with a friend!?	There is a guy that I met in one of my classes last semester.  He was always very nice to me and he always talked to me and was very polite. He talked to me more than anyone else in the class.   As soon as I would email him he would email me right back. I saw that he was in one of my classes this semester so I emailed him to make sure it and it was him.    On the first day of the class he completely ignored me! He didnt sit by me or say hi and he completely ignored me! He left and he didnt even look at me the whole class time! I missed some class because of the weather and I emailed him (because he is the only person in the class that I know) and he has not emailed me back. It hasnt been very long, but since the way he acted in class I really dont think he will ever email me back.     Its not like I asked him to give me the answers or to do the homework for me, I just asked what the assignment was. He was always very nice and very friendly to me. I was always really nice to him and I never felt like he didnt like me. I have not given him any reason to hate me or to not like me.    When I needed help on a paper last semester he even gave me his cell phone number and said I could call him and he said it wasn't bothering him at all. That is not something you would do if you wanted the person to leave you alone and they were bothering you. That was about a month before he started ignoring me.

20090205112515AAqlhS1	Family & Relationships;Family	If you see your step mom just running all over your dad, what would you do?	I know the logical response is just to keep my mouth shut, mind my own business... and that's what I've been doing so far, and it's tough!!!    Basically, this is his 3rd wife... he's 49, she's 29... she immigrated here (America) from Vietnam on a fiance visa. He met her there on a business trip.  Well now that she's here, she doesn't work (and she can work now, she has a permit), she doesn't help out around the house, whenever I come to visit she's always in pajamas just laying around... and then on top of it, she has such a cold personality, she never has anything nice to say, she always complains, and I've notice her taste has gotten quite expensive (Coach bags, dept store makeup, etc.) my dad thinks she's the best thing ever and he WONT shut up about her... and honestly it just makes me sick.    Has anyone else gone through something similar and had to keep their mouth shut?    I so so badly want to say something to him and tell him to open his eyes, but I know it will just cause more trouble.

20090205105804AAImR9b	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What's going to cause the least amount of damage to my family?	I have 2 kids and I've been married 3 years. My wife has suspected me of cheating before, although it never actually happened. I love my wife, but I don't feel like I love her the way a husband should love his wife (I'm really not "in love" with her and haven't been for a while). I love my kids more than anything in the world, and I want them to have a normal life. Recently I've found myself attracted to a girl at work. I know she feels the same way. She is aware of the fact that I'm married but it doesn't seem to bother her. What's the best course of action?      1. Get a divorce.    2. Ignore these feelings and go on the way I have been.   3. Cheat on my wife and stay married for the kids' sake.      Suggestions?      I'm really trying to get at what would be best for my kids.
20090205112227AAkBNGH	Family & Relationships;Friends	Should i slap this girl?	My bf has a female friend who i had a feeling didn't like me but now it's confirmed. When he changed his status on Facebook to 'in a relationship' she wrote something rude on his Wall in response to that. That really upsets me bc i have never done or said anything rude to the girl as a matter of fact, i have given her food, drink, cigarettes etc when ever she asks (a lot)   Now i'm torn, part of me pities her bc it seems like she's just jealous bc she'll never get a decent bf like mines (she has had sex for money many times and most guys in our community know - plus she has no job, no transportation, lives at home, dropped out of school -a real waste of life)   but the other part of me is angry that she would attack me on such a public forum for no reason and i wonder if she's looking for a confrontation bc obviously i would see the post and react. What should i do?

He is dependant on me with computers, helping around the house(even though i don't need to) and just likes me around to abuse, harass and throw around. My hip still hurts from three weeks ago when we got into a really nasty physical fight and had to wrestle him to the ground.

Tried blamming me for attacking him first...yah right.. hes like 80 lbs heavier than me and HORRIBLE anger issues..so, started anythign with him would be stupid. So, he wants me to stay around the house for the next 3 years. Im like, yah right, dream on! So, Now im graduated early from hig school, he is f*ckin POed about that!!! And in two days im moving out for the 2nd attempt.

20090205103626AA4EL71	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Please help if you, can direct me in the right direction?	My sister was diagnosed with a brain tumor in 2006, and ended up having 7 surgeries in a row. developed a infection of her skull plate after tumor removal and has a prostetic plate in its place. Ok now here is the situation, during this time her husband was planing on divorcing her while in surgery. I guess he did not believe in for better or for worse, he is six yrs yonger then her and they have a child togther. He cheated on her while she was laying in a hosp. bed. He made her sign a sepertation agreement a few mths after having brain surgery. When you have a brain injury, it changes who you are. Her husband is in the military, has found a new girl friend. He now has filed for a divorce using military benifits, and is filing for a no contest divorce. We belive he is trying to mary this other girl so that she can have the military insureance. He is trying to give my sister full custody of their child w/visitaion for him and that he has to pay child support. The thing is my sister can not keep a job, due to memory loss and irratic behavior, she had to give custody of her other child not by him to my parents. She has lived with several diffrent people, including my self. But due to her irratic thinking, she is very negitive and put strain on our family and her child, so I had to ask her to leave. I now have her daughter until the end of the school year, and then her dad will come and get her. My mom can no longer take it, so she may have no where to be. Due to a lack of funds we are unable as a family help her get the help she needs. We can not afford a lawyer, tried legal aid, try to see if we could get someone to do pro bono, but because he is in the military he was able to get a military lawyer. We have tried to get disability for her, but b/c she presents her self well, no one sees that she does not handle her finanses well, and other medical symptoms that she has stated above, my mom had to take out a tempory power of attorney over her. She has been denied disablity in which we are still fighting. They feel like her overwhelming Doctor visits and documentaion were not enough to have disabilty.Her husband filed in a diffrent state in which we were told that we would have to hire a lawyer there to move the case here. This has been going on for several mths trying to get the divorce to stop at this point. Because my sister is unable to raise her child (not that she does not want to), her husband will get custody, she will be left with out insurance, in which she really needs because she still has some swelling on her brain, and we belive that he should be paying her alimony, due to leaving her in a disablity state. And because my family feels like we have done all that we could, exausted all our revinews, and because we do not have the funds for a lawyer that we should just give up and let him have the no contest divorce. Which means that she will have nothing, b/c she does not have a lawyer. She has already lost her children. And will lose her insurance, and may not have a place to stay soon and become homeless (because we are unable to care for her, because of her irratic behavior and the negative affect it has had on the children in our homes) It is not that we want her on the streets, it is because we want the safty of our children. The systam and the military has really failed her. She needs care that we are unable to provide her. Sorry that this was so long. If anyone of you out there that is reading this and knows a way that you can help send us in the right direction. I plea with you please help before she is on the streets. The courts state that she needs to respond by the end of January or the Divorce is final as a no contest divorce. Meaning he pays nothing and gets everything. thank you for your time.
20090205105544AAO459u	Family & Relationships;Weddings	For those of you who had destination weddings? (or have simply attended them)?	I have been thinking more and more of having a wedding in Vegas. Not a drive-thru wedding or anything, still something nice, just somewhere fun. My fiance worries that some people will not be able to make it.     Before you planned your destination wedding did you make sure the "important" people would be able to attend.     We have 15 months, I think I am giving everyone plenty of time to save up money if they would like to attend. He's unsure.     And even if they cannot make it I still plan on having a party when we get back.     What are your opinions? Thanks in advance!
20090205102646AAJGwcK	Family & Relationships;Family	What am I supposed to do?	Yesterday I found my long lost air soft gun that did not have an orange tip. I was messing around with my friend Ryan and shooting him in the leg and stuff.      Then my mom asked me to go up to wal-mart and forgetting I had the gun in my pocket i got in my truck and drove up there. halfway there i realized it was in my pocket and tucked it under the seat so nobody would see it sitting there while I was inside the store.      I forgot about it and then today my mom went in my truck while i was in school and took it. She told me I'm in big trouble. Apparently she thought i was going to use it for something bad.      What do I do to avoid any trouble?

20090205105352AALYvdJ	Family & Relationships;Friends	Would you still be her friend?	This is a serious question, and I only want serious answers.      So I've been really close with this girl since I was 6. I am almost 18 now. We have grown up together, and pretty much were inseparable.    However, now that we are older, i feel like she is taking advantage of me. I'm the one who has to make friends for her and I always give her rides places. I introduce her to everyone, even her current bf.   I sometimes feel like she is trying to sabotage me. She finds a way to destroy all my potential relationships "to protect me" and she copies everything I do.      Now that she has a boyfriend, she barely talks to me at all. She goes out with all of MY friends and claims its because she wants to discuss her bf without hurting my feelings. She does things in such a way that I can't call her out on it, she is so passive aggressive that its so hard to talk to her.      I dont know, am I overreacting? Would you be her friend still?
20090205111424AAsGhNb	Family & Relationships;Family	My mother is suicidal. Should she move in with us?	My mom lives across the country and always talks about miserable how her life is. My siblings and I all try to help her out all the time by offering a place for her to stay, in 3 different states, away from her life now. I can finally offer to have her stay with me while she seeks help, but I don't know if it is a good idea because I finally got my life together. I feel like having her here will help her out, but I don't want to fall into the same path that she has raised us in. I'm really confused because i love her so much, and want her to do well. But then on the other hand, I have been dealing with her suicide attempts my whole life and it is extremely draining. I also have 2 children that I am raising, and I don't think it will be good to see negative people around all the time. But maybe seeing the kids will bring her some joy? And if she was really going to commit suicide, she would've done it already right? I don't want to come off like I don't care, because i do, a lot. I just worry about all of us falling backwards due to selfish behavior on her part. Please Advise!

20090205111038AAV04qJ	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	He left his family 18 years ago moved on she never did ?	His ex never remarried and they have two grown kids in their 20's ... We been together (married) 14 years.  They don't want to know me, hear about me and he calls them up quite often and I am sure he doesn't bring me up.  He calls when I am not home.  I think she still has feelings for my husband.  She never moved on and met someone else. She never told the kids about me until he did in 2005 and she actually told him he should have waited a few years. They were 17 and 19 at the time.  They are not babies.   Till this day he continues to call, speaks to her 1/2 hour here, 1/2 there sometimes one hour.  I think it is an emotional affair.  He can not wait until I get home from work at 11pm so he uses this time to fulfill his time?    I think it is wrong.  No man would want to call his 23 year old and 22 year old 6 times a week sometimes on a friday night at 1015pm . I see the calls to her house on my digital phone. She likes talking to him and I feel since this has been going on for 2 1/2 years now he isn't stopping. He tells me to deal with it. He doesn't see them often they live 5 hours away and he said she will always be in his life. I understand this because he knows her from the mid 70's and has been a family friend. But there was about 8 years where they didn't speak and then I said call your kids (they didnt want anything to do with him) and get to know them and now look. What did I do?  It is getting to know her not only the kids.  His daugther even came out saying to her mother where has he been all these years but then shows a loving side to him and he thinks it is an act. Then why call there almost every night last week for an hour each time. How much can you talk about, I said?     He thinks I have a trust issue with him. He goes I don't cheat or lie to you oh so what is this. It is an emotional affair of some kind.   Wouldn't you agree and people my dad or my stepdad or even my friends father to her 4 year old calls once a week not 6 times a week this is about wanting to speak to her also -

20090205104234AAsrJkf	Family & Relationships;Friends	How do i deal with an annoying ex best mate?	It's a long story but i'll shorten it down for you :)    Basically I used to be best mates with this boy who isn't very smart and has got adhd, he is really annoying and he used my phone to send abusive texts to my other mates without me knowing. I'm not bigheaded but I am much smarter then him and he knows it, he constantly makes fun of me and normally i'm not to bothered by this as I'm quite popular and hang around with other people, but he keeps following me and is like a shadow! I dont want to ask him to go away as I will feel bad but Ive put up with him for around 3 years now and i'm starting to lose it. He always interrupts and knows how to get right on my nerves.     Everyone thinks we are best mates, I tell them no and they just laugh and say yeah sure. I am praying I get into the college of my choice next year, the thought of having to spend another two years with him is unbearable! Tbh I am close to losing it and punching him in the face, it seems to get worse by the day and his comments are starting to get to me after having to put up with them for three years. I'm starting to hate him, like seriously and when I get home I constantly punch the walls and am losing it, something which has never happened 2 me before as I'm usually calm. Has anyone got any advice to calm me down,  I dont have anger management problems or if I do this is the first time I've ever been angry in about 16 years lol    Thx 4 help

Would you / have you ever moved out of state without your child(ren) so that the divorce could be amicable?  My husband will not grant me an uncontested divorce as I want to move back home with the children and we are stationed 1,100 miles from there.  He has 3 yrs left and he said I can go, but not the kids.  Would you temporary be the part time parent, due to location?  This is what I was asking of him.  In court I am sure I could get what I want, but I dont want to fight with him any longer.  I recognize living in the same town and split 50/50 would be best for the children, but military families are different.

After much arguing... and the realization that it wasn't going to happen he sort of gave up and decided on us just being Friends. But I feel like he and I could never just be friends since one I still do like him and second every now and than he'll bring up the sex topic. This guy kinda has me sprung...

20090205095239AAb1Jhg	Family & Relationships;Friends	I given up everything and it turns to ****!!?	I moved out with my best friend a few months ago. I fought my entire family to move out with her cuz she needed a roomate and I was just fine living at home. When I say I fought my entire family I mean I fought my entire family tree. They didnt understand why I would move out when there wasnt a reason to but my reason was my best friend needed me so I was going. Almost all of them are still bitter that I moved out. We work together as well and we are like 1 person there she does something wrong I get yelled at for it because I'm less combative than she is. I've fought with ppl because they've dissed her and almost lost my job. I shaped my entire life to make her happy and take hits for her all time. No problem what are best friends for!! But she told me the other day that she is moving out state with her man when he's done with college. I'm pissed and I'm hurt because they fight alot and most of the time they don't even act like they want to see eachother. She said that there was alot of factors like where she was at in school if they were even together then. So naturally I've thought of breaking them up!! I've decided not to. I'm trying to be okay with losing the one person I depend on day to day, my best friend, my co-worker, the only person I've really ever trusted. Lets just say I don't have a great past and she had proven herself to be more trustworthy than anybody I have ever known. Oh did I mention she helps me stay out of trouble and fall into old habits if you know what I mean. How do I cope with losing her??

20090205095839AAmjN3l	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Will taxes be taken away for child support?	I have 2 kids from the same father... he had 2-3 jobs this past year and only worked a few weeks at each job. I applied for child support last year because it was a fight every time he received a check. Out of all his checks which could of amounted up to $900 - $1200 his two daughters received about $200 for pampers and what not. He pays no bills whatsoever, he lives with his mother. His daughters are his only responsibility; He visits them whenever he wants, i let him spend time with them... he doesn't care if he sees them or not, or if they're taken care of. He gets his papers from child support and just throws them away and refuses to go to any appointments they send him. Tax season is coming and he's full of empty promises. I'm in a bind right now and I'm worried he's going to get his check and spend it on his self and his habits rather than my 2 daughters. Will they take his check from him? I tell him to just sign over any rights he does have so that my kids won't have to endure any more pain as they get older and he refuses. I've searched online for answers but can't find anything.  What can i do?

20090205100307AApVsOH	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Broke up after almost 6 years i don't know what to do?	My bf broke up with me Jan 3rd and like 2 weeks later he already has a girlfriend. so i know he was already talking to her. I'm so heartbroken that he dumped me. He said it wasn't exciting anymore. at first it was just going to be a break and we were going to start dating again(each other) i had just moved in with him and he made me leave. I was such a good girlfriend to him treated him like a king. never cheated on him. But i seen him a couple of times since the breakup and when i do he kisses me and everything but then like the next day if i speak with him he seems like he regret letting me come over. He says he doesn't miss me but how can i not cross him mind at all it was practically 6 years! i didn't talk or txt him for like a whole week then on Super bowl sunday i went over and he was all over me kissing me holding me. Then the next day i went again and he was even more affectionate with me. he says he has a girlfriend but why does he do this with me. i know i should let him do this but i miss him so much and it makes me happy when i do see him. He says for me to see other guys but i can't and plus i didn't have someone lined up already like he did. he took my phone without me seeing and read all my txt and probably checked who i was talking to.i asked if he would be mad if one of his friends wanted to talk to me just to see what he said and he said he would be so mad at his friend. i was supposed to meet a guy but i backed out and he read that i was and seemed bothered by it. just the way he acted those 2 days and other days i've gone over makes me so confused. everyone was shocked he broke up with me cuz they all know what i put up with and how i treated him. even his parents were shocked and made that he finally moved in with me and made me leave month and a half later. His new girl has no idea about me. would any girl want to date a guy who just broke up with his girlfriend of 6 years like 2 weeks before being with you. i just can't see how he wouldn't feel weird kissing some other girl or doing more. its like i never mattered to him or he ever really loved me. i just am so hurt i just want him to realize that were supposed to be together. has anyone ever got back with someone who did this to them?

Next year I will be a sophmore and I wanted to get an apartment off campus when I go to school, but to do that I would need to bring my car with me. It really isn't mine but it is the car my parents designated as my car to drive around in. I am willing to pay half of the car insurance and for gas, as well as work to pay for it. I already have a job and have been working for 3 years.  I asked them and they said no. I want more responsiblitity. I am 19 and I am mature enough to handle it. The college is only a half hour away so if there is ever any major trouble then my parents won't have to come a long way. How can I convince them?

20090205111528AAZ1dJa	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Am I being selfish about marriage?	Ok I'll try to keep it short. I've been with my boyfriend for 6 years, living together almost 2 years. We're done with college and we both have stable jobs. I love him, he loves me, etc. There is really nothing else to achieve in life (in my mind right now) except marriage. It's true that it's been on my mind a lot more because so many of my friends are engaged or already married. I have no desire to get married tomorrow but I want to get engaged. He says he's not ready, no need to rush anything because we already live together. I'm looking for a real commitment and gesture of his love for me, all he has to do is ask. I'm 29 and I don't want to wait forever, I want to have a family sooner than later. I've been talking about this with him for a year, would I be really selfish and hasty if I put an ultimatum on him for say, a summer engagement?

20090205113233AAYYFE7	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Wedding - who pays for what?	Getting married and mum is on her own. Me and boyf are paying for some(what we can afford), my mum is paying for majority and she's retired so the money will come from investments which are worth little at the moment. My mum is upset as his parents haven't offered to help out and she feels like they're expecting her to pay for everything as the tradition but things are so expensive and she's concerned. Now I feel bad about it. I get the feeling they think it's for the bride's parents to pay. The other thing is they show no interest either. In the end boyf had a word and basically asked are you going to help out so they did end up offering but only cos he told them to. So they are contributing ￡1,100. This includes the flowers and photographer. My mum said to me she thinks it's bad reflection that they haven't offered to help in some way not just a case of financially. H2B says it's not a case of them not being able to afford it they think it's a waste of money. Not allowed to tell them how much our honeymoon costs as they will hit the roof aparently, H2B paid for it. But my mum sees it as them being reliant on her paying for everything and it would just have been nice for them to offer to help off their own back. Total cost about ￡10k. Sounds a lot but honestly it all adds up. Average wedding supposed to be ￡16k. What are other people's feelings on this.

20090205113538AAHfLKy	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Have feelings for each other but she does not want a relationship?	me and this girl i like have had feelings for each other for 2years+ now since getting to know each other. we have "went out" 2 different times both which lasted a couple of months but we never got to the sex because i was too nervous then (i know i was hopeless). Anyway things have changed i had a rebound relationship with someone else after the 2nd time "going out" and i won't be nervous anymore. And after both times we stopped talking to each other for awhile but we're friends again.      Anyway shes back down again and we've been hanging out a lot (nearly everyday) and the feelings have sparked again for the both of us. When i talked to her about it she said she feels the same way but she doesn't want a relationship let alone a long-distance one (when she goes back) and that she doesn't want to hurt me again because she doesn't do well in relationships.      It feels like every time we are together we can't help ourselves from having feelings but how can she not want something more? I recently was depressed but when she came back i actually felt happy and I don't want to lose this happiness. Should I talk to her about it or just not do anything and enjoy it while it lasts? She goes back overseas soon but wants this to continue until she does even after i asked for more. Sorry guys about the long post but i REALLY NEED HELP.. I don't wanna lose her again. What do you guys think is going on? And what do I do?

So I sat down kind of close to them to look at the guy, like a couple of chairs away. I was just staring at him, and he sometimes looked at me, and we both smiled at each other a few times too. His girlfriend noticed that he kept on turning his head to look at me, and she noticed that I was looking at him too. So the stupid girl asked her boyfriend to go get her another drink, but that was just an excuse to make him leave, so that she could talk to me. Than the guy left, and the stupid girl accused me of flirting with her boyfriend. What the hell, I was just looking at him and stuff, I didn't even say a word to him. We said crap to each other, she got pissed and raised her voice at me. I was like ok whatever, and I just left before things got worse. Anyways what the heck was her problem? Was what I was doing seriously that bad? I mean if you were the girl in my story, and you noticed me looking at your man, would you even care? If you say yes, than why? All I'm doing is looking at the boy, what the heck.

20090203035719AAdllUr	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Did I blow My Chance With Her?	There is this girl I like who goes to my school she is a freshman (14) and I am a junior (16). We are both in the band, have gym class together and are both on the schools swim team. In general she is smart, quiet and will not likely talk to you unless you initiate a conversation. I on the other hand am very talkative and outgoing and am smart also. In band we both sit near eachother. There are two people (from left to right) on one side followed by the girl I like, then my friend in the seat next to her (who doesn't know I like her), then me on the end. My friend during band always talks to her and flirts with her. My friend flirts with everyone though. I am very shy around her and do not know how to talk to her. I also do not talk to her much because I chicken out and just watch my friend put in his two cents even though he has a girlfriend. We have our last swim meet tomorrow. Do you think I turned her away from liking me if she did by not talking to her? Can I reverse it so she would like me? What should I do inregards to the girl i like and about my flirty friend?

20060607073507AAGcRlV	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Why do they always call it a fatal attraction?	Why is it that when a man (usually married) gets involved with a woman on his own choice and carries on an affair with her and acts like he likes her, but then he gets tired of her and dumps her and goes back to being the family man, that the woman is made to look like she is crazy and stuff.   I hear about this often and there are movies made about it.  It seems everyone takes up for the guy and thinks the woman is crazy just because she doesn't want to be thrown aside.  Why did the man get involved with her to begin with?  Does everyone really feel that it is ok for a man to carry on an affair with a woman and then just dump her when he wants to play the "good husband and family man".  I think these guys get just what they deserve when the woman stocks them.  This isn't something I have ever experienced but just something that I have always wondered about.

I believe there is a difference in falling and being truly in love and loving someone... I do believe you can have more than one soulmate... my best friends was my soulmate in a different way than my true love... but I really believe you have that one person you fall in love with and sometimes it doesn't work due to circumstances beyond your control but you can still move past that and love other people but it isn't the same as being in love.

20090203041938AATdIlP	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	This is why my bf broke up with me...?	i've been with my bf for a little over a year. like any couple, we've had our ups and downs. we just broke up last night and he told me that he feels very superficial for why he was breaking up with me but that those superficial things are very important to him. he says that i am a wonderful person. i am sweet. he loves hanging out with me, talking to me, that i am very fun to be with; however, he also says he likes exciting-ness, the feeling of newness, and that that feeling has faded for him. he used to be very physically into me, but doesn't feel as strongly anymore. i asked if it was because it became winter time and i started wearing sweats more and he replied yes.      what pains me so much is that he says i'm such an awesome person but he can't get over this "newness" feeling. it seems like he's after this "honeymoon effect" but those don't last forever and i told him that that is something that a couple has to work on together, but he feels like he can't try anymore. i told him i feel like he's making a mistake by wanting to trade those fleeting moments of novelty for something so much more than that and he said he does feel bad for being such a shallow person but he can't help it.      i guess i don't really have a question. but i hope he'll someday realize that there are more important things in life. that his pattern of hopping from girl to girl will get old. that he should really cherish people not for more than superficial reasons. he said the spark is still there, but that it's not as exciting for him anymore. but at some point in any relationship, shouldn't there be that time when you just get passed putting on a facade and having to impress the other person all the time, and just accept them, and enjoy each other's company and love each other?       i wish his reason for breaking up was because i was mean, or because he hated me, but i feel like this reason is unfair and an attack on me, like i'm not pretty enough. we did tons of activities together like go to movies, the zoo, party, clubbing etc. he said he had fun and still has fun but still can't get passed his need for novelty. help?

We had been close friends for a while, he has a girlfriend and things got messed up when we both made the mistake of kissing each other. after that he dissappeared, ignored me completely and stopped talking to me. after two months of silence, he apologizes and says that he was scared of his feelings that grew and wants to go back to being friends. i was cool with that because i valued his friendship more than anything. i text him and we will have a good convo and then out the blue, he will just stop without saying bye. but when i dont text him he asks me why i dont text, and tells me to call him sometimes. and when i call, i never get an answer. i asked him if he feels awkward and he assured me that everything was cool. he called me once but it seems like im always the one texting and calling and sometimes when i do text him, he doesnt answer. what should i do? Did he lose interest or what??    I asked him if he regrets the whole thing, and he said no!

20060613225838AA0wZQR	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Why is she being distant?	My G/F of two years, is growing more and more distant. Less and less sex, intamacy and contact. She blames it on her work and career and a 14 month child custody battle that continues to drag on. I would like to move forward and talk about moving in together but until her custody battle is over, she will not even entertain a discussion on the subject.      I just get the feeling that she is with me so that she looks good in the courts in relation to her custody battles and the great relationship I have with her son.      What do you all think. Should I wait this out, custody battles can drag out for years or is it just an excuse to mask her decline in feelings for me and accept such and move on and find someone more available

There is no one that can share our jokes and she was the only one i could be myself infront of and we had so many good times, we talk over msn and it reminds me of how we used to get on, i forgive her for backstabbing me and being a ***** but it would be awkward if i said do you want to go cinema some time to catch up, the first thing she would do is report to her cronies (my old group) that i've gone all soppy and desperate to be mates, i know you think im some troubled teenager lol but i really miss her how should i approach her?

20090219115058AAxBrsF	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Am I Right or overreacting?	So here's the thing, my boyfriend of 8 months still talks to his ex. They text every now and then, I've told him that it bothers me and he told me that i have nothing to worry about because he loves me and they broke up for a reason. I mean i completely understand that ex's can still be friends but last night she sent him a text saying free pass to ask me anything, he forwarded it back to her and she said "do you wish we were still together' AND HE WASN'T GOING TO TEXT BACK!  That just really hurt plus when he read it he had this stupid smirk on his face. I cried my eyes out and he said he wished i would stop worring because I am the only one for him. Am i just being a dumb girl or do i have the right to be hurt and upset like to the point where i want to find her and well..... you get the picture
20090205115328AAupU9q	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I just get over him??????? ?	There's this guy from school who has feelings for me. I like him too, but, the thing is, the only way we actually communicate is through texting and I'm sick of it. At school he never ever speaks to me and it feels like when we text I'm talking to a whole different person. I'm tired of waiting for him so actually come and talk to me in person so I figured I should probably just forget about him.    I know I should try and talk to him myself, but, I mean, how am I supposed to say anything to me when he doesn't even give me a glance?   I'm thinking about just not answering his texts anymore and just forget about it.   Does this sound like the right thing to do???? I'm so confused.

Whenever I'm standing at the stall, he walks up behind me and squeezes my buttcheeks. When I tell him to stop, he tells me to shut up. And then when I look back, he has this blank stare in his eyes, as he begins to run his fingers up my chest. Then he just squeezes my butt more. When I put my pants on, he pulls them back off and tells me to shut up. He tells me we have a "special relationship." Do we have a special relationship? Or is he taking advantage of me?

There is this one guy in particular that I liked and I made it quite obvious that I liked him.  I mean I told all my best friends and I talked about him all the time. And she knew right from the get go that I really liked him. But then my friend, one day decides she likes him too, right? and because she is more out spoken and I am kinda more shy around guys, she like started going up to him and asking questions like "Who would you rather?' and stuff like that. And now guess what, they are going out, I know.!!! But what I want to know is, if she really was my friend wouldn't she have considered my feelings and how it would have made me felt? I dunno am I over reacting or yeah so? Thanks for reading!!!

20090205114818AAcyheL	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What to do - cheated on?	My wife and I have been married for 3 years now.  I just discovered that she's cheated on me for the second time.  I can't describe how hurt and betrayed I feel, especially after giving her a second chance.  But part of me can't let her go.  She's definitely the hottest girl I've ever been with.  She's got a beautiful face and generous curves in all the right places.  I'll never get another girl this hot.        So I don't know what to do.  I want to leave her, but again, I'll never be able to get someone this hot again.

20090205115357AAA4pUQ	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Marriage is Outdated?	I mean government has no place whatever in defining or recognizing marriage. It should be strictly a private matter, as it can be exploited as a means to get some cheap benefits from the government. Let any couple, opposite sex, same sex, man and dog, siblings have any bond they want, and they can call it whatever they want. But government shouldn't recognize this bond.       Life would be so much easier if they just did this. Why don't they?

20090205114102AAcNFDK	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Lady problems - ladies please HELP me!?	Hi - I'm a 19 year old male art student and I have GIRL PROBLEMS. I've always had girl problems. I lack the confidence to talk with girls (mainly around my age group) the same way I talk with dudes in my age group. I am not gay or bi, I'm just shy it seems. (And I don't have anything against gays and bis!) I hate being shy! Its the worse most embaressing freakiesh thing on earth. To think - all the girls I could have made awesome friends with but didnt because I was too freakin shy!! Just the other day this really nice chick from my college started chatting with me and eventually she showed me her portfolio, but I just froze. Like I didn't know what to say. Her art wasn't terrible. It could have used some practice. All our art could use practice, but I just didn't know how to crit or comment it. I did not want to hurt her feelings. I'm no good at lying. If I said her art was good she would have seen I was lying through my teeth. So I just froze and then I went on a rant of how much of a dick she must think I am. And I even sort of lectured her how a friend of mine who was worse than me at art became better. I felt like such a d i c k. I can't imagine how she must have felt. I tried to divert the conversation to other things just to soften the blow... we chatted nicely but the nerves! And she even said I should've taken social classes before going to college which was funny. I laughed my a s s off at that. We both kinda joked and laughed, but the guilt. And I was only really laughing because I was nervous! I want to say sorry to her, but not sure how. My mum says I "should just let it ride for now and bring it up jokishly in a conversation later on". Oh yeah and I'm not sure but I think she might be attracted to me. I hope she doesn't cus I don't have time for that sort of thing. I just wanna be able to make really awesome friends with chicks. I don't care about sex! I really really don't care... well ok. Maybe I do lol. But just a little. I hope you know what I mean. I'm not into swinging and nocking up random chicks. Oh and one last thing. I'm not as shy as I used to be around chicks. I used to not even be able to talk to them. It was so weird. I feel like slapping my former self and saying "snap out of it!!!". I'm not as bad as I was back then but I need change. Oh and one last last thing --- there are quite a lot of things that have hurt me in my life. Some things I will probably never tell anyone. This might have something to do with it. Idk...... I've said enough.

20090205114354AALkeLq	Family & Relationships;Friends	Should you really care what people think?	Ok here's my problem... My best friend of 10yrs who is like a sister to me has been with me through all the bad and good of my last 10 years of life!  She says I have changed and rather than being the sweet quiet girl I was now she says everyone says I'm arrogant. (by everyone I mean mostly people that she hangs with not really those I would choose to deal with.)  We met when I was 21 I am now 31... When I met her I was with this guy who was pretty much treating me like the scum of the earth and back then I was stupid, naive, weak minded and had extremely low self esteem.  So long story short I left him about 5 years ago and got myself together finally and during this "me" time I have began to learn alot more about me and wanted to change some things about me I didn't like, such as not being able to talk to people or tell people how I feel about them or whatever they are doing with out feeling like I'm going to hurt thier feeling.  I feel I am just kinda "finding myself' but I don't understand when someone goes though a life changing experiece such as a bad relationship do people expect you to stay the same?   Honestly I am to the point where I am starting to not really care what people think and just do me but when I do this is the response I get , its that I'm arrongant!  So is it me or them?

20090116034910AAYHg1l	Family & Relationships;Friends	How can i become closer with a drifting best friend?	Me and one of my best friends met at the beginning of the school year last year and we've been bff ever since.  Lately she's been acting kinda rude, mean, negative, and depressed.  Then on myspace she lowers me in her top (this may sound immature but top friends are what shows who your bff is). And on her AIM profile it says like bff for ever and then some with 3 other peoples names, not including mine. This really upsets me because my friend asked her about it and said something like "we're just good friends". And whenever i try to talk to her about something like if she's been acting depressed, she's always like "i dont care what people think of me" and pretty much makes me feel dumb for trying to help.      how can i get closer to her? i feel like we're drifting apart or i did something wrong. but i'm pretty sure I haven't done anything wrong.

20060622190823AATsc3i	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	At what point should a person call it quits in a relationship due to financial concerns?	Just to give you a little background info........ my ex-girlfriend wants to get back with me.  When we were together five years ago, she spent money unwisely, wrote hot checks, didn't pay for speeding tickets, always needed cash for one thing or another.  We broke up because I got tired of covering for all of these expenses by myself.  We went our seperate ways, she got married to someone else, had a kid and I concentrated on getting myself up on my feet and saving money.  Now, she's divorced, wants to hook back up with me and says that she's totally different in regards to her spending habits.  She showed me a $5,000 CD that she had just deposited in the bank which shows at least some responsibility.  I'm skeptical because of the past and I don't want to burn all the money I managed to save.  I loved her when I broke up with her 5 years ago, but I just could not stand the financial pressure any longer.  I never want to feel like that again.  Am I crazy for even considering this?

20060710085007AAEnUeB	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I think I have another chance with my soulmate, what should I do?	I have known this guy since 4th grade, he was immediately my best friend.  We liked each other very much all through school.  We decided we were too young to date in JR High, and would wait 'til some time in HS.  Unfortunately that time never came as he had a gf or I had a bf, but we would still spend time together.  Anyhoo, we kept in touch as we went to seperate colleges, and when I would start to forget him, I would get a text or email, something to remind me of him.  Well, he was really busy with school, and I with work.  We started to lose touch so I tried contacting him a few times to no avail.  I erased him from my phone/email/contacts, cause I decided I needed to get over him.  Then yesterday, I saw him in my hometown and it brought alllll those feelings right back. Granted, he now lives about 5 hours away.  I want to try talking to him again, but part of me doesn't.  I have always felt like he was my soulmate.  I don't know what to do.  What would you do?

Everything was going perfect until one night I get a IM from him saying we need to talk and not on the internet on the phone and I was like okay. I kinda knew what was coming. Well if you havent already guessed it yes he broke up with me and this was right before our 11th month anniversary too, the funny thing is he didnt really have a reason as to why he was doing it and it was also very random and came out of know were because two nights before he came over and we got along really good and he didnt act like anything was wrong he even said to me a couple of times that night I love you so much so I thought everything was going perfect I never in a million years would have guessed that he was going to break up with me. I still really really like him. Every time I think about it, it makes me more and more upset please I just need some advice and encouragement on how to get over him.

20060720074629AADBAij	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Follow up to previous post about significant other?	well she sent me this email guys what do you think? FYI, the reason I haven’t spoken on my feelings yet is b/c I want to look at my feelings/the situation from all angles.  So when I talk to you I have full perspective on it and I’m clear about what I’m saying.  Yes, I know I’m a bit distant but it’s b/c I’m deep in thought.  I’m sure it’s difficult for you not knowing but I would appreciate if you could respect my wishes on this.  I will let you know when I’m ready to discuss it.  And no, I will not expect you to just be ready to talk when I’m ready.  If you’re not, I understand.  As for right now, if you don’t want me to talk to you just let me know.  I can understand and respect that.  Thanks.
20060720102400AAd2MLq	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Guys....have you experienced this?	recently during sex with my wife (who is a former model and has a killer bod even after several children -without one stretch mark) i had a really firm erection and then i moved down to do oral sex and began kissing her belly and breasts, i lost my erection.      she got upset at me and felt I was not finding her attractive, etc.      i have had to get up several times a night to urinate and have also found that i have high blood pressure. i used to be 180 when we were married and in good shape. now, i'm 250 and out of shape severely.       i need to work out and recently i told her i thought i could see four of my former six pack. she got upset and said, well, who are you going to show that off too.      I said, you. She said, i don't care what you look like. although she is very vain and obsesses over her looks.      i would like to loose weight. if I do, would this improve my health and also my sexual performance?

She doesn't say anything but looks up for a moment, then back at her phone.Her girlfriend says "this is Janice". i say nice to meet you to Janice. I ask for her phone number, she says i'm dating someone.      She's shy but why make all that eye language (3 hours worth) and invite me in to just tell me she's dating someone.

I go along with his choices of food and a movie even though he said I could pick, and sometimes he goes along with mine. I went out of my way to deliver something to him, and he knows this. I say hi and smile big when I see him, and he does too. I told him he could eat my food and he shared his food with me too. I told him about movies I like and he went to look for them to watch almost immediately. I try to ask him how school is and when he is sick, I try to follow up and ask him whether he's better.       But he doesn't call me, text me, and sometimes doesn't talk to me for a week or two. But he asked me out for a movie, even though we went in a group and he didn't talk much to me.    I'm afraid that he might not like me because our physical apperances don't match. He is goodlooking but I am quite plain and on the plump side. But he still talks to me.    Am I giving him enough signs? Is he giving signs too?

20070630221925AA18TiG	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	How Do I Win Back My Girlfriend?	My ex broke up with me quite awhile ago, but in the past couple of months, she started hinting that she hated her new boyfriend because of his manners, the way he treated her, and the rumors he spread, and so she told me she wanted to breakup with him and start dating me again. Weeks later, she told me she was trying to make him break up with her, then we could start dating a couple months after (because she needed a break since she's been dating a lot in the past years). Then, he found out she liked me again, broke up with her because of it, and now she wants him back, even though he's dating someone else, is going off to college, and has had sex with at least three different chicks, while dating my ex! Her excuse is that they've been dating for awhile, but he is a dirty S.O.B. who tryed to have sex with her, even though she's not into that stuff. What do I do to realize he's a bad guy and I would never do that to her, I love her more than anyone else?

20080925102421AAWEwab	Family & Relationships;Family	What should I do about being accused of being violent, when I am not.?	I have recently found out that I am being accused of physically abusing my sister.  It is true that I am violent by nature, and work quite hard not to lash out at people, which I rarely do.  However, I have at my sister before, a couple years ago.  But I continue to be confronted by family members, saying I have done it on a more recent basis.  If I did, I wouldn't be asking this question, or even have the balls to post this, but I DON'T.  I'm a lot more mature than I was and I know that is not acceptable.  Does this mean that she is lying and continuing to tell family members and her friends that I hit her?  Does it mean that I actually am still violent and have some sort of rage-induced amnesia?  I don't want this whole question to sound stupid, but I have zero recollection of doing so... what should I do?

20081010125106AArrzPA	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	My husband cheated on me with 6 women? I can't get over the pain. What should i do?	Ok so i have been with my husband now for 10 years. We got married a few years ago after our daughter was born. About 4 months ago i found out he has been cheating on me throughout the years. I had to force him to come clean with me. It was one girl a day pretty much for almost a week. While it was happening i was destroyed emotionally. I was vomitting and crying.....it was the worst pain of my life. We always had a rocky relationship, but i was the bread winner, i cleaned, cooked, took care of our child.....we had our great times, but we also had some really bad times. The cheating started like the 2nd year into our relationship with a girl at work that was after him. They had sex once, and then it was done. Then the next girl was an older women he was talking to about our relationship with, and our problems, then he had sex 2 times with her. Then we broke up for a month, where he left me and the country without telling me(we were living together) and had sex with his childhood sweetheart. Then he came back, found me, and we got back together. 8 months later i was pregnant....like 4 years into our relationship. Then he had an affair for 5 months with someone when our daughter was like 5 months or so. They had sex many times. Then he was good for a while, and we got married. KEEP IN MIND I HAD NO IDEA YET OF ANY OF THESE WOMEN!!! Then i ran into a family emergency where i had to take custody of my teenage brother. He had many problems, so the courts ordered a therapist for him to come in my home for 20 hours a week to help him and me in dealing with him. His therapist became my friend, and our daughters became best friends. Once my brother moved back with our mother, we stayed in close contact. I left town for a business trip twice that year, and my husband never had been alone with our child to run the house, so she helped out, and the kids played. I was gone for one month, came home for almost 2 months and then left for another month. The whole time they were together with the kids. Then she stopped answering my calls, and then moved in with my mother in law who was looking for a roomate. Turns out i found out she was after my husband, and they had an emotional affair for 2 years, and had sex 5 times. He said he kept trying to avoid it and thought they were friends that kept making the mistake. All the while she (my best friend) told him she really didn't like me, and i was just a pain. Whatever...so now here i am. 10 years with him, i love him, we have a beautiful family, he has began to change, and treats me better than ever, but i still HURT so badly!!! I think of it daily, sometimes all day. every question you can think of comes to mind. i try to avoid it, but my mind is a mess. i am depressed and feel so betrayed. it has been 4 months since i found out. I just feel like the last 10 years are nothing. I feel like i wasted my time. I was faithful. i feel like he will do it again.....10 years....that's a long time!!!! i feel like all our vacations and special time meant nothing to him. He of course says he was just stupid, and made a mistake, and was blind to the extent of what he was doing. he promises to never do it again. He wants to make me happy for the rest of my life and even remarry me, to start fresh. What do i do?? This is all so hurtful. My heart hurts almost all day everyday. I cry during sex. I imagine him with others while having sex....of course i don't try to do this, but i do. I try to erase it, but it haunts me. I'm so lost.......any advise?????

20090203034616AARwa3X	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why does my boyfriend hold my head during sex?	like, if we are having sex and he is on top sometimes he rests on his elbows and has his forearms outstretched and he places them firmly beside my head on either side. The thing is, i can't really move my head and i think he knows it. I don't really care, it doesn't hurt i am just wondering if this is like a dominance thing? lol seeing as i am tiny i thought he would realise he is pretty dominant lol but he continues to do this. Why is this so? I'm just wondering...      And another thing he does is he puts his hand under the small of my back and kind of lifts me a tiny bit up, kind of tilting my hips at a different angle, does this affect how deep he goes?      Thanks lol

20090203041548AAKYCN2	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My bestfriend married my boyfriend...how happy!?	I have a boyfriend for almost 6 years and through out our relationship we are happy until the day my bestfriend told me that she is pregnant...She kept on asking me for advices and I told her to told the guy about it. Even though the guy has a girlfriend, he still have the obligation to take care to...I did not know that she is refering to my boyfriend. When I found out, my boyfriend told me that it was my fault in the first place for neglecting him and then my bestfriend told me that she really love that ex of mine ever since she first saw him...My boyfriend told me that he still love me and is willing to take good care of the baby and my friend but I have to stay with him. I did not agree and I asked him to marry my bestfriend which he did eventually after my bestfriends parents get mad...on their wedding, my bestfriend asked me to write a song for their wedding march and be their bridesmaid. I was hurting but I did it eventually for the sake of our long time friendship. A day after their wedding, I received a call  from that ex of mine and told me how misserable he was and that it is my fault if something bad happens to him, to my bestfriend and to the baby...      Is it really my fault? Am I accountable for the mess? Am I wrong in asking him to marry my bestfriend? Am I wrong for allowing my bestfriend to do what she wants and have everything she likes just like everyone around us say/...Am I really insane?

I'm pretty sure the guy doesn't like me more than a friend. We used to fight alot. Anyway, my boyfriend is the most caring and sweet person I have ever known, but he's sort of dull. I don't know what to do. I'm leaning towards continuing to talk to the guy as a friend, but I don't know.

Lately I get upset or disgusted by almost anything he does. There are other issues and I sometimes feel I shouldn't have married him. We have a child and when I search myself I find that I love my husband and I do not want to leave him. I made a commitment to him and my christian values does not uphold divorce apart from the stated. I feel underappreciated by him, he makes no effort to commend, complement and I wonder if he loves me. They say love is shown, an action - maybe I'm at the wrong theater. I found his nonchalant attitude, interesting at first but then it spilled over into our lives and now it irks me.    I need someone to talk to about all this. Any advice.

We were never married, but when she was born he was "the good guy" so i gave her his last name. Now I live in NY and he lives in PA, we don't have any custody agreement through the court.       he never calls, only pays child support when he decides to work for more than a week, and doesn't see her unless i bring her up to PA to see my parents, then he demands i bring her over to his house. he has never once, in the 2 years over lived in NY come down to get her.      Now my question is, im getting married at the end of summer and want to know if i legally have the right to change her last name to my fiances? He takes care of her, supports her, she calls him daddy, she doesn't even know my ex. He has been there for her since she was 3 months old. I didnt know if i had to go to court to get custody of her, or his permission? Or if i could just do it since he isn't in her life? Thanks!
20090219112722AA7cK0P	Family & Relationships;Friends	Moral Dilemma: Keeping a Promise or the possibility of hurting my close friends feelings?	Last September I started a new school, because the school I was at couldn't cater me for further education.   I've always found making friends hard, so a couple of weeks in, when i made some new pretty amazing friends, i was really happy, and have been since.      Last night, me and 3 other of my new friends had a girls night in, and the guys had a guys night in some place else.   One of the guys apparently "got it off" and quite a bit more with a girl who turned up at their night in.   He rang me earlier this afternoon, and said even though he didn't think i would, asked me and made me promise not to tell anyone about what I'd heard of happening.      The thing is, this guy, and someone I consider to be quite a close friend (since she took me under her wing when i started this new school, and has been a really amazing mate to me since and who wasn't at the girls night) are REALLY close. They're the sort of pair, that seem to be going out (cuddling, flirting, spending a lot of time together ect.) but they're not actually an item, just good friends.   But i think my close friend, may have feelings for him, more than she sometimes lets on.      I don't know whether to tell her about what happened last night with this guy and other girl, cause im presuming that's who he meant when he said "don't tell anyone" and since all my/her other mates who were at the girls night know about it too, or just to ignore it and keep quiet like he wants me to.      I don't want to feel like i'm keeping something from her that effects her and I feel like she should know, but i don't want to break my promise and possibly put a spanner in the works on their friendship.      Help!!

20090219113804AACqrFS	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Is this guy just a jerk,or what?	Me and my brother have this so-called friend that we go to church with.And a couple of months ago,I had a myspace.So I asked this friend to add me,and he did.Then a couple of weeks later,he suddenly disappears from my friend list.So I went and asked him what happened,and he says that this other girl we're both kinda friends with did it.He said he gave her his password so she could "change" some things on his page for him,and that she was the one who deleted me from his friends.The person who did it also rejected my brother's friend request,even though this guy and my brother were good friends.I believed him when he said this other girl did it,because for some reason she doesn't like me anymore,though we used to be friends.She rejected my friend request when I sent her one,too.So I didn't think anything else about it,because I couldn't do anything.So I let it go.      Then,last night,this guy tells my brother and another one of their friends that he's the one who did it all along.He deleted me,and he rejected my brother's friend request.I wasn't there when he admitted it,because if I had been,I definitely would've given him a piece of my mind.He LIED to us by telling us that it wasn't him who did all that.And he made the girl that he blamed it on look bad,too.He even lied to my mother about it once she found out.That really got her mad,too.I've been ignoring him ever since,though he's tried to get my attention.And he and this other guy both ignore my brother when they're all 3 together,and that's not right,either.Plus,the other guy our "friend" hangs out with actually blocked my brother on Myspace,though they're supposed to be friends.When my brother asked him why he did it,he just said "cause".My mom wants to talk to our "friend" about the fact that he lied to all three of us,but I don't want her to fight my battles for me.Now my brother doesn't want anything to do with either one of them,and neither do I.So what can we do,besides ignore them?      Sorry this so long,it's just a complicated situation,and I really need advice.
20090219114019AA20dZ2	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Recently married, almost a year. We've been together 5 years total, now he is rude to me and doesn't care?	He's in college. Almost done. He is always busy as am I but when we are together I want to be so sweet just for the little while we can spend together but he is rude. I try to tell him but he just says "no I'm not" then he gets angry for taking up his time "arguing" and says things like "now I'm in a bad mood, I didn't need this today" stuff like that. I am not very beautiful or anything but I get attention from other guys and I don't flirt back or anything b/c I am married but then I go home and am excited to see my husband and he is a jerk. Very short with me and rude. It just makes me think. ya know? Divorce is not an option and I know he is not cheating on me... he only hangs out with his studying friends at his university. What can I do. Please no "divorce him...blah blah blah" I want real honest answers from men and women. Thank you. Also no kids involved. Thank you in advance.

My hubby has planned a 10day vacation for we 2 and he wants to keep our for baby with my MIL for 10days. My MIL was working as babysitter before our marriage but then she stopped.

I am not comfortable with his parents. My FIL is almost in bed, needs help for everything. I am working from home & handling baby.

I dont know if its reasonable to think just on monetary terms. My MIL will come here and keep giving me advices based on her baby sitting experience.

20090219114916AAWvgdH	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	My husband wants to be friends through our separation?	My husband cheated on me...he admits that he's no good for me. We've been friends for 10 years--married for 3 of those years. We have a young child together. I know I can't just cut off ALL communication with him, but I know that i need to stop talking to him as much as possible.  He still wants a cordial friendship with me. It's like losing a husband and a best friend.  I can be cordial for our child, but really, is there any reason for us to call each other just to chat? That's what he'd like. Is there a problem with me being his friend, or will that only make moving towards divorce more difficult. I know i don't need to be with him...though i wish we could save our marriage.
20090219115111AA4ycZF	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Which is better for society divorce,adultery or polygamy?	With so much divorce in the western world today,and increasing levels of marital infidelity,wouldn't Polygamy be one compromise for this problem?With so much negative press surrounding men with multiple wives,in all level of fairness,wouldn't it be better if Polygamy with limitations be a fair way to control these problems of society.For example the man would have to agree to a written contract that no 1 His first wife gives her consent,no 2,he must provide for every wife equally in all levels financial,sexual and emotional.And 3.He must respect all wives with equal levels of housing,protection,legal and medical aid.      Many people feel emotionally charged about this subject however few people consider the enormous emotional strain divorce has upon children when men go astray or find themselves attracted to another woman.
20090219115043AA4lbMm	Family & Relationships;Friends	Please answer!! thanks?	Ive been friends with someone for awhile and when we would hang out it would be wtih a group of people and as i hung out more with the friend i knew longer i started to become friends with the other kids in the group. We would hang out a lot, but usually i would wait for my friend who i knew for awhile to call me and get the group togehter. I never really called the other kids in the group except for a couple of times, and we would usually hang out when the friend i knew for longer called everybody. These guys were so much fun to hang out with, but still were probably not my best friends. Recently, the friend who i knew for awhile who was really a great kid passed away from cancer. I still talk to the other friends in the group i would hang out with, and i feel like i am still really good friends with them. I still wanna to hang out with them, but would feel weird to call them up to hang out and they really dont call me. Im just not sure if they would really want to hang out, but i miss all the good times we had. Should i just call them up anyway?

20090219123615AAtnHf7	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Am I wrong for doing this?	My bf of 2.5 years cheated on me about a year ago, and during that year he was also asking other girls for naked pictures, while in a relationship with me. So anyways, I forgave him and he's changed a lot now. But for about 5-6 months now, I've been chatting with a guy online who I havn't met yet. I like him, he likes me, and we just do some harmless flirting and sometimes talk about making out and sex and getting married. For some reason, I feel I have the right to do this because my bf cheated on me before. I don't want to break up with my bf.. But I feel happier talking to the other guy. Am I wrong?

I was none stop crying the last couple of days. he was mad that I hung out with one of my guy friends. I found that after he dumped me, he wanted to get back together. everyone said we should. but i said no. i told him we can't even be friends. then he began threatening me and harrassing me.       He still wants me back. So my questions are      1) Would you get back together?   2) Would you just stay friends?   3) Would you ignore eachother?
20090219122522AAICsaC	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Am i wrong here or is he?	i know i posted this an hour ago but i got only 6 answers and several of them were very rude and did not answer my ? just criticized me and made fun of my past decisions.      my fiance and i have known each other over 2 years. This is just 1 of many examples i could give u, but last summer i purchased a boat.      my fiance, greg, wanted the title to have his name on it along w/ mine but i said no. i kept it in my name only.   Now, this year he wants to add a buncha new things like a new radio and a new swim platform, ect.   He also is getting a bunch of new and very much needed safety features added to the boat, but they cost alot of money.   I'm trying to save $ in a savings account but greg wants us to both spend our tax returns to get as much as possible in order for the boat to be ready this summer. I am willing to put the boat in storage this summer until i can get a job and our 5 month old can get a lil older but greg is not. he says if we can't take it out this summer, he's going to take out all the engine parts he bought & put in and strip the paint he painted on and sell the parts and accessories on ebay he also says "if i'm gonna be like that" then he refuses to haul the boat, work on it, ect. ever again. i explained to him that were just putting it in storage for 1 season until we both get a better job and can save some ect. but he says we can afford it now and i don't have a job so i needen't worry about what things cost and do as i'm told to do.      This is 1 of many things we argue about almost daily. When i mentioned i wanted to get a job before we did anything big like that he said you don't even have your license to drive to a job and your too stupid to learn how to drive any way or to get a good job thats not fast food.      later he always makes up w/ me but doesn't apologize. he says things like "i'm not trying to be an ****** but this is how i feel." and he talks nicer about the subject and we reach a peaceful agreement.      is any1 else going through this or something like this and how do you deal w. it? i normally just listen to him and whatever he says in the end b/c if not he gets loud and screams at me and it scares our baby. so what should i do?   i had a lot of inheritance and i purchased the boat out of my sole money. it wasn't shared $ or anything like that. the money was only mine and the boat is only mine. i had a job at the time too but have since quit it to accommodate my pregnancy and then my child.

I did not tell her I had a crush on him.  I wonder is she saying this because the guy she reports to has a crush on me and maybe he is getting information from her about me for some odd reason because he is rather nosey when it comes to me.

A few weeks ago i showed him this new smoothie place near my house. we went there where we were given loyaltycards, with 8 spaces. you fill up 8 spaces you get a free smoothie. "x" is addicted to there. now i dont really care if he likes smoothies. but he texts me to tell him in there. i hate this. today he sent me another one and i texted back:      "Stop frikin texting me. i dont care"      he then sent back a rude text going mad at me stating he wanted me to come. that was when it hit me. Why?      i texted back sayin i dont (bleep) want to go out with you. stop texting me.      He then sent back a text sayin i was a (bleep).

Whenever we meet new friends or something, they always bond and stuff, and I'm always awkward. People feel that they can tell me their secrets, and open up to me and everything, which I'm glad, but I have never in my life opened up to a friend before about like crushes, family, or anything, and I feel jealous of the quality most girls share. I'm quite "hyper" and loud when I'm relaxed, but mostly I always feel left out. When my old best mate and a new friend are singing to a song as a joke, dancing, or just chilling, I can never join in. I feel a lot of emotions inside - like lots and lots and lots, but I never express them. Like, I'm self-concious to talk about stuff I like, clothes advice, and music to my friends, cause im worried....I don't know why. How stupid. I really really really like my friends and all that, but I'm really bad at showing them how much I like them.

The wedding is planned for two months from now, but with the current state of the economy, he was laid off last month and has only been able to find a job which pays nearly half what he was making before so now it looks like a lot of our wedding plans will have to be canceled as we'll be working with a much smaller budget and to be perfectly honest I just don't feel he makes enough for me to be able to live as happily with him as I had anticipated and I'm thinking of calling the whole thing off.

In PA, if two people are willingly getting a divorce (although she initiated it) what would decide if the man has to pay alimony to her? she works, they don't have any kids togehter (she has one of her own- whose father doesn't pay child support and the man she was married to was supporting this child who wasn't his) and they have been married for a year. What would determine if he has to pay alimony?
