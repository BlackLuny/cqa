20090227075630AAtpmQC	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	How long do your child's tantrums last?	I just asked a question about my 4 yr old daughters tantrums.  If I can't get her calmed down right away, her tantrums will usually last 30 minutes to an hour.  Do other children have tantrums that last this long?  How does your child typically act during his/her tantrum?  My daughter flails her arms around and whines and grunts.  If I can get her to calm down and tell me why she is behaving this way, her tantrum is very short.  But if I can't manage to get her to calm down, the tantrum turns from flailing arms and whining/grunting to screaming, crying, and being violent.  She will usually act this way for 30 minutes to an hour.  When she gets this way, there is literally nothing I can do so I just give her some space and allow her to "go through the motions."

Both were negative (which is unsurprising since it's a little early) but when I fished them out of the garbage after work in the afternoons (I can't help myself) there were faint lines....they were definitely evap lines, since it'd been hours (and they weren't colored).  But the wierd thing is that I always look at my tests after they are hours old, and never before this week have I seen any sort of evap line...and then I've seen them twice this week!      Has anyone had evap lines and then ended getting a positive later on that cycle?      Thanks!  Baby dust!

It is currently 61 degrees outside and my oldest daughter (3 years, almost 4) and I are just aching to spend some time outdoors. I also have a 3 week old baby and it is just the 3 of us here.

20090305123211AAakPsl	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	My toddlers behave poorly only in public, how can I get better control?	At home my two boys (2 & 3) act great. They do what I say and behave appropriately. However, when we go out...my 2 year old goes wild. My three year old never acted as bad (nor does he now) as my current 2 year old. They know the rules, they know what happens when they break them (I'm very consistant), but when we go out it seems they just don't care. They both go 2x a week to a mother's day out and the teachers/leaders always tell me my two are the best behaved, and do exactly as they are told etc. But when I take them somewhere like to the zoo, aquarium, mall playground etc they wont listen, they don't want to sit in the wagon etc. Today we went with a group from our church to the aquarium---and my kids ran all over the place, it was totally embarrassing. I constantly was fighting with them to stay close. Not only is it a battle to get them to behave out in public, but they seem to listen to everyone else's directions but mine. Barring the harness/leash, what are other parents doing to better control this situation? I hate looking like the foolish woman whose kids run all over her when out.          By the way, I have just left and gone home before when they've acted up, it doesn't seem to be much of a deterrent for them though. I've made them stand in time-out while out in public, and I just don't seem to be getting anywhere. I hate not to be able to go anywhere (although, it sure looks like that might be what happens).       What do you do differently and how do you get better results?

I had my nipple pierced but took it out when I was 20 weeks pregnant so it could heal up and I could breastfeed. Now, since my milk came in, the flow on that side is so heavy that I leak constantly and my baby can't latch on. Everything was fine before the milk came in and we tried again the other day after leaving it for a while so I dried up a bit and that was all fine until the milk came back in properly. I wonder if anyone has heard of a problem like this before and if you have any advice because I would love to breast feed solely but currently I can only feed from the one breast and give her formula to supplement it (I have tried pumping but I caused more damage to my nipple).

20090305122021AAq2OcZ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	How to get my son to stay on his tummy during tummy time?	My son is 8 months old. I really didn't realize the importance of tummy time till recently so when he hated it I didn't do it as often, maybe 5 minutes or so a day. Now when I put him on his tummy he immediatly rolls on to his back. Nothing I seem to do including putting toys down there for him to play with or even me getting down there on my tummy seems to keep him on his tummy for any length of time. He isn't crawling yet, and at this rate doesn't seen anywhere near crawling. He was scooting backwards a few weeks ago but has stopped that now. He can sit for very long periods of time on his own and will bottom scoot a bit to get around. He is also standing a bit if you place him on his feet and let him hold on to something. Should I be worried about him not being on his tummy? What can I do to keep him from rolling over and instead stay on his tummy?

20090305132549AAutIzy	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	My 18yr old stepson has become a freeloading drifter. What to do?	He "lives" in an apartment with 2 friends where he is the "couch guy" who pays hardly any rent but has no room. He comes home for 15 to 30 minutes twice a day for food and to drop off his dirty laundry and get clean clothes so he is still taking what he needs from us but has abandoned his responsibilities like taking out the garbage.        His personal hygiene is now non-existant and he was getting hired for a city job washing busses, but was too lazy to finish the eye test (his eyes are shot from not changing his contacts regularly and he doesn't think he can pass it) so he's pretty much lost that job. He still has a job washing dishes a few hours a day though.      How long should I let this continue? It's been over a month- he's taken his TV and games and stuff, but nothing else. I told my wife he needs to figure out where he's going to live and actually live there, but she thinks he needs more time to explore and find himself.  My wife refuses to take any steps to control his behavior because she is afraid he will be mad at her and not speak to her.  There is no chance of that changing any time soon.

My period is due saturday and today I woke up and by the time I had walked to the bathroom I had a small puddle of blood in my underwear...but that's all that's happened.  I just figured my period came early, it's been a little off schedule since my last baby almost 2 yrs ago.  I had unprotected sex valentines weekend....which I thought was like 6 days or so ahead of ovulation, but, ha, you never know.  So, really I know I could just take a test and find out but I have a cold and don't feel like going to buy one so I guess I'll just have to wait a few days and see.  But I was wondering if anyone would share their stories with me to see if anything is similiar, all info on this says it should be a light pinkish only when you wipe so I don't know what to think.   Oh yah, and I have had really bad lower back cramp type pain....dont know if that's uterus type cramping or not, that never comes early!

I don't know what to pack in their lunches for daycare... any ideas? I don't want them to get burnt out on eating a sandwhich everyday.

20090305130240AAO4mSc	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	FOR PRO SPANKING PARENTS  ONLY!!! HELP!?	My 4 year old brother calls me dad because I am his legal guardian. I have him and a 9 year old brother and 13 year old sister. I have full custody of them and I am their legal guardians. I am aloud to spank and hit them and discipline. My 13 year old took my belt out of my draw to hit her 9 year old brother. I NEVER ever use a belt on these kids. I only use my hand and a wooden spoon on the 13 year old. I left them for 10 minutes and saw her spanking him with a belt. I was stunned. He was screaming a lot. I got her to stop and I gave her one quick smack with my hand on her butt and told her to go to her room and wait for me. Now she has never done this before but her brothers do provoke her to get angry (poking, calling her mommy, hitting, pulling her hair, all the normal little brother stuff.) I don't know what to do. I told my brother to pull his pants up and to go in the theatre (we have a movie theatre in our house) and told him he can have some of the candy that's down there. I know what it is like to be hit with a belt. My dad used to beat me then I was adopted. I am 20. Anyway how should I discipline her? Should I spank her? Keep in mind that she is already grounded for getting suspended, back talking, disobeying me, attitude, and much more she also has no phone and lost all her cherished things (laptop, phone, web cam, and so much more). Any ideas on how I should punish her. I told her I would be up ther at 4:30 to discipline her and she will not put up a fight if it's spanking. She does refuse to get over my lap. I barely have to spank her. I use it as last resort. Please help! And if you are not a beleiver in spanking then DO NOT ANSWER. Thanks.
20090305125225AAlVwdm	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Older parents have you been mistaken for your child's grandparent?	My Dad had me  with him one day as a toddler and was mistaken for my grandpa. Let's just say my Dad's response wasn't too nice. I believe he was in his late 30's at the time. My husband and I have been mistaken on a few ocassions as our son's grandparents. I guess I shouldn't have gotten offended but, I did at the time. It made me feel as if it was more acceptable to be a grandparent than an older first time parent. Have any of you experienced this and what was your reaction? I realize that there's quite a few older parents out there probably about even amount of older parents as there's younger grandparents. That's just a guess of course, I haven't researched the statistics on that. LOL Please share your experience. Thanks in advance. take care. First time older parent of a toddler- 42yrs. old.

20070322084724AAWndEg	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Baby food question???	I just started my daughter on baby food.  Now, I was told that you should start with just 1 single fruit and/or veggie and you could switch to a new fruit or veggie in 2-5 days I guess to make sure that your baby doesn't have any allergies.  Well, so far my child has tried 3 veggies and has had 1 fruit.  The pediatrician said that at meal time she should have the rice cereal a fruit and a veggie????  I am so confused because I have been told so many things.  Since the baby food is very new to her she doesn't eat too much of it right now.  She usually takes a few spoonfuls of each thing and then she's done.  Usually, after  the baby food I have to give her a bottle of formula with cereal.  My dr said not to give her bottles with cereal anymore...why not? What am I suppose to do when she is not eating very much baby food?  Im a new mom...

I have applied for State Medicaid,Florida Healthy Kids & KidCare and all of them have denied me for too much income. My husband does not make that much money and the people looking at his check stubs are saying no beacause they are looking at the net instead of the gross income.

20090227041823AAMHDz6	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adoption	What will you do if your daughter is not adjusting well to her new family?	i have a little cousin called nicole, who is four years old. she is a very spoiled little girl, who always gets upset when she doesn`t get her own way. she was an only child raised by her single mother. aunt rose had recently got married again. her husband is a man called harry, who was a single father. he has a six-year-old daughter called jade. jade had also been greatly spoiled by her father, who doted on her. after the wedding, the two girls did not get along. nicole often tattled on jade and got her into trouble. jade thought nicole was an annoying little sister. unfortunately, jade got cancer and was in the hospital for ages. she had to undergo many treatments, including chemotherapy, which made all her curly hair fall out. when she got home, people gave her most of the attention. they let her have her own way because of her illness, which made nicole jealous and bitter. nicole feels ignored and left out. she threw temper tantrums and became greatly attention-seeking. she had even tried to fight with jade on some occasion.. there were times when she was mean to her sister. nicole had teased jade, called her names and took her anger out on her. when they go out as a family, jade might not feel well and they have to hurry her home. nicole would cry and scream because she wants to stay and play. aunt rose and uncle harry would just comfort her, saying"we have to go home now because your sister is tired. we will play later." what can i do to help them?

20071203101449AA1YPom	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	Ce soir pas de blagounette, un petit conte ?a vous dit?	Il était une fois, dans un lointain pays, une très belle princesse, célibataire.   Elle avait un problème: chaque chose que la princesse touchait se mettait à fondre le métal, le bois, le plastique… A cause de ce handicap, les hommes avaient peur d’elle. Personne ne voulait l’épouser. Le Roi était désespéré. Comment faire pour l’aider ? Il consulta alors ses scientifiques et ses magiciens, qui conseillèrent :   "Si ta fille trouve quelque chose qui ne fondra pas entre ses doigts, elle sera guérie."   Le Roi avait trouvé une solution...   Le lendemain, il organisa une compétition. Chaque homme doit apporter un objet qui ne fondra pas entre les doigts de la princesse…   Celui qui détient cet objet la guérira, l’épousera et héritera du Royaume.   Trois jeunes princes relevèrent le défi:   Le premier prince apporta une énorme barre de titanium. Mais hélas, lorsque la princesse la toucha, la barre se mit à fondre comme de la cire. Le prince reparti sidéré.   Le deuxième prince apporta un énorme diamant, pensant que le diamant était la matière la plus solide dans le monde, il proposa à la princesse de le toucher. Mais hélas, lorsque la princesse le toucha, il se m?t à fondre. Le prince reparti découragé.   Le troisième prince approcha. Il demanda à la princesse,   "Plonge ta main dans la poche de mon pantalon et touche ce qu’il y a au fond."   La princesse s’exécuta et mit la main dans son pantalon, Alors qu’elle rougissait de plus belle. elle sentit quelque chose de très dur. Elle le prit dans sa main. Et rien ne fondit !!!   Le Roi était heureux. Tout le Royaume éclatait de joie. Et le troisième Prince épousa la Princesse Ils vécurent heureux et eurent beaucoup d’enfants…   Jolie Histoire non ???   Et vous ne vous posez pas la question, quelle question ???   Qu’est-ce que la princesse a touché dans son pantalon ?   (Voir la réponse plus bas)      Il y avait un “M&M's” bien-s?r. Il fond dans la bouche, pas dans la main.   A quoi pensiez vous ?

La sélection commence par un entretien avec le chef de projet d'Ariane-Espace. La brune passe la 1ère. Le responsable lui demande :   - Si vous aviez la possibilité de partir sur une autre planète, laquelle choisiriez-vous ?   La brune réfléchit :    - Je veux aller sur Mars car j'ai lu dans un magazine que la vie extra-terrestre existe peut-être sur cette planète. Le chef de projet convie alors la rousse et lui pose la même question.    - Moi, j'irai bien sur Saturne pour observer les anneaux de plus près, explique la rousse.   - Très ambitieux ! reprend le responsable.   Et il interroge la blonde. Cette dernière réfléchit plusieurs minutes et finit par répondre :   - Je veux aller sur le soleil !   Avec un sourire en coin, l'homme remarque :   - Mais, vous serez br?lée vive avec la fusée avant même d'y arriver !   - Vous me prenez vraiment pour une idiote...

Certains et certaines répondront d'un cri "oui et je le fait avec bonheur" mais cette réponse ne me satisfait pas. Etre parent c'est élever un enfant et finalement faire au mieu mais: sommes nous pour le coup obligé de renoncer à nos propres envies ou à nos propres aspirations? Nous disons ne pas vouloir faire subir nos rythmes à nos enfants..mais tout sacrifier au nom du bien être de nos petit n'est il pas également dangereux? ne risque t'on pas d'y perdre notre équilibre? N'y a t'il pas une position médium entre le "tout faire pour mon enfant" et "faire comme si rien n'avait changé".

Et ce n'était pas la question! la cigarette, l'alcool font partie des addictions et peuvent faire l'objet soit d'hospitalisation pour l'alcool soit de suivi pour la cigarette! Au nom de quoi  vous permettez vous de juger aussi durement?

Il est affligé! figurez vous qu'après notre entretien téléphonique et après avoir raccroché, la directrice a dit au papa qui était dans le même bureau qu'elle "et puis en plus Monsieur Calim nous ne vous repèterons plus que vous devez garder Clemence pendant vos jours de RTT!". Complètement abasourdi mon cher et tendre a répondu: "mais madame je n'ai pas posé de rtt! et la maman gardait clem pendant les siennes!" Réponse de la dame qui a toujours raison: "vous n'allez pas me faire croire que vous travaillez 50heures par semaines!".   Le tout en hurlant dans le bureau!    alors moi je dit qu'à ce niveau de bêtise ?a devient grave! vous vous doutez les cop?nautes que je profites de chaque RTT pour être avec ma fille  et que cette accusation est encore mensongère.

Elle coupe le sexe de son mari et récolte 12 ans de prison         Par Zigonet Zigonet.com - Vendredi 2 mai, 07h55Une femme de 64 ans a été condamnée mercredi 30 avril 2008 à 12 ans de prison pour avoir coupé le sexe de son mari en juin 2005.      (Publicité)   En juin 2005, le petit ami de la dame, agé de 39 ans, avait été évacué en urgence à l'h?pital de Saint Quentin, dans l'Aisne, avec le sexe tranché. Sa concubine avait alors expliqué au personnel de l'h?pital que leur chien avait arraché et mangé le sexe de son ami.      Alcoolisé lors de son arrivée à l'h?pital, l'homme n'avait plus aucun souvenir de ce qui s'était passé. Aucune arme n'avait été retrouvé sur le lieu de l'incident, et encore moins le sexe de l'homme.      Malgré le fait que la femme nie en bloc les accusations portées à son encontre, désignant le chien comme le responsable de l'acte, elle a été condamnée mercredi 30 avril à 12 ans de prison par le tribunal de Laon, dans l'Aisne.

20080629155041AAHUlZ8	Pregnancy & Parenting;Baby Names	Elizabeth ? Qu'en pensez vous ? mdr, fallait quand meme y penser !?	ELIZABETH, Illinois - Le village d'Elizabeth, dans l'Illinois, a tenté samedi de battre le record du monde... du plus grand nombre d'Elisabeth rassemblées en un endroit.      (Publicité)   Toutes les femmes au nom tiré d'Elisabeth, ou plut?t Elizabeth en anglais (Betsy, Beth, Liz, Bess, Eliza, etc...), étaient les bienvenues. L'une des 400 participantes portait même Elizabeth comme nom de famille.      L'événement a attiré des femmes de 20 Etats américains, priées de présenter un certificat de naissance ou un permis de conduire.      "Nous avons invité la reine Elisabeth II, mais elle a poliment refusé", a déclaré Susan Gordy, qui a participé à l'organisation du rassemblement. L'actrice Elizabeth Taylor a également été invitée, mais n'a pas répondu, selon Gordy.      L'événement visait à honorer les Elizabeth célèbres, dont celle qui a donné son nom à ce village de 700 habitants. En 1832, Elizabeth Armstrong faisait partie d'une communauté de colons américains qui avait résisté à un assaut d'Indiens, selon Gordy. Armstrong, ainsi que deux autres Elizabeth, aurait fait preuve d'une rare bravoure, d'où le nom du village.      Selon Gordy, la municipalité va envoyer une demande de reconnaissance de cet exploit au Livre Guinness des records. AP

Comme chaque année, le vieil Eugène et son épouse, Mauricette, vont faire un "check-up" chez le médecin.    - Comme d'habitude, il n'y a rien à signaler ! lance le docteur. Mais, comment faites-vous pour rester en forme, c'est incroyable.    - C'est que Dieu veille sur moi, répond Eugène. D'ailleurs, je vais vous faire une confidence: il me fait signe. Tenez, hier soir, je suis allé aux toilettes pour un besoin urgent et la lumière s'est allumée toute seule. Lorsque j'avais fini, elle s'est éteinte toute seule. C'est bien une manifestation divine, non?    - Tout à fait, lui répond le docteur qui ne veut pas le contredire. Rhabillez-vous et allez attendre votre femme pendant que je l'ausculte. Entre alors Mauricette.    - Bonjour Docteur!    - Bonjour Mauricette ! Dites-moi, votre Eugène, il n'a plus toute sa tête. L'autre soir, il m'a dit que la lumière des toilettes s'était allumée toute seule quand il s'y est rendu...    - Ah, le con ! coupe brutalement Mauricette. Il a encore pissé dans le frigo !

This week I had my first period that ended yesterday (might have been a little end-of-period-discharge today, but not much, not enough to wear a pad)   We also had sex this morning, but it was not the first time (doctor gave me her ok at 4 weeks)      I noticed that I had a "discharge" that looked like a tiny tiny bit of flesh (smaller then barley, let's say as an exemple). It was pinkish. Has this ever happened to anybody else? What could it be?      I have an appointment next week with my doctor so I will most certainly bring it up... But until then your point of view would be appreciated.

J'aime bien mon terme "fécondation" ^^      Bref, je m'explique :      Non, je ne suis pas en train de vous demander si je suis enceinte, alors que j'habite à c?té d'une pharmacie qui vendent des test de grossesse, comme toutes les pharmacies d'ailleurs...      Ma question se porte su les symptomes de grossesse :      C'est étrange, car j'ai eu mes règles le 1er janvier.   Donc, logiquement, si fécondation il y a, ?a devrait être dans les alentours du 14 janvier...      Mais j'ai réellement des symptomes de début de grossesse, (j'ai déjà un enfant, je sais ce que c'est), les seins qui gonflent, des nausées...      Mais 10 jours après la fécondation présumée, ce n'est pas possible! Non??      Je demande ?a car vraiment, ?a m'intrigue. Je ne demande pas si je suis enceinte, (?a, je le saurais debut du mois prochain), mais si il est possible d'avoir des symptomes si t?t...      Ou si il est possible aussi de faire un genre de "grossesse nerveuse".

20080927082402AAAGjrc	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Baby hasn't wet her diaper?	every morning when i wake up with my daughter, i change her diaper first, and its usually pretty full. this morning, her diaper was completely dry. she hasn't had diarrhea, but she has pooped (which is what she usually does within an hour of me changing her first diaper). I fed her a 6 oz bottle and she drank 1 1/2 oz of water. she isn't on solid foods yet, except the rice cereal. how long should i wait before i call the doctor. its probably been 12 hours since her last wet diaper. 
20080928180532AAJTPMK	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Did your baby have a negative reaction to poly-vi-sol?	I just started giving my 6-month old enfamil poly-vi-sol drops (multivitamin drops) b/c my doc said i should start giving her vitamin D and iron supplements. I gave it to her for the first time last night and she was fussy throughout the night and kept waking up crying. She was still fussy when she got up this morning. This afternoon she had a loud black poop which is totally abnormal for her.       Is this a normal reaction to the vitamin drops? i was wondering if it was the vitamin drops or if it was something else.       Did anyone else's baby have negative reactions to the vitamin drops? did your baby just get used to them?       Thanks.

20081108195433AA3jBb7	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Did I have a miscarriage or was I 3 weeks late?	My period was due on Oct. 20th. The night before my husband and I had sex and he ejaculated inside me.    I figured that I was late due to stress and aggravation, so I put off buying a pregnancy test for a few weeks.    I bought a test yesterday and wanted to take the test this morning.    I woke up with severe cramps and back ache. I laid on the couch for a few hrs., and when I went to the bathroom I was bleeding heavily. Which is abnormal for me on the first day. Usually the first day is a light flow. (Needless to say, I didn't take the test today.)   Usually, I have symptoms of PMS about a week before I get my period. Symptoms include: breast tenderness, mood swings, back ache, fatigue....   I didn't have any symptoms this month. I started feeling a bit nauseous about 1 week ago, also found myself urinating more frequently and when I had to go really bad, I could feel that my uterus was hard.    I'm not sure if I talked myself into being pregnant or if maybe I was.    I know I should go to my OB-GYN and have an exam (which I will do), but I am curious right NOW, if maybe I was pregnant.   What are the signs and symptoms of a miscarriage? Could I have talked my body into believing I was pregnant? What are the odds that I was pregnant? Can a woman skip a month or 2 of her menstrual cycle due to stress?

20081115194414AACOrTy	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Co sleeping with baby?	My baby is 8 months old how ever she doesn't want to sleep in her crib anymore and I was wondering if there's anything out there made for her to be able to sleep in the bed with us because to be honest we need more room where we live and the crib is taking up much space so since she doesn't want to sleep in it its there for nothing. I've been looking at those sleep positioners you can place in bed with you but when i read the reviews it says they grow out of them soon which for my baby is not good because shes 8 months old already...is there anything else that can work for us?

20081116210037AAdFGie	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Taking baby for walks..but its chilly?	My son is three weeks old and Im ready to start walking to lose a bit of the weight that I gained during pregnancy.  I live in Alabama and the weather is starting to get pretty chilly (50's this coming week) but I was wondering if any of you other moms had bundled up your babies and took them for a SHORT stroll every now and then?.  I would wait till he is at least a month old before I did this (and still not sure if I will), I wanted to know how other babies reacted to this and if other moms were comfortable with it.  I can ( and will) exercise indoors but I really enjoy the outdoors and I hate to keep my baby cooped up...besides the fact Im a single mom and dont really have anyone to watch him regularly for me to go on a walk.  Thanks in advance!!

20081118064832AAWO9bG	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Sleeping with mommy, How do I break that habit?	My daughter is 8 months. She will sleep in her crib just fine. The problem is she wont go to sleep unless I lay in my bed and cuddle her to sleep. She wont fall asleep in the rocking chair... I can transfer her after she is asleep. I also do this the 2 times she wakes up in the middle of the night. Sometimes I fall asleep with her still in my bed instead of putting her back in bed. So now is is use to sleeping in my bed half the night. How do I change how I put her to bed so I can just put her in the crib?
20081118065837AAY0Aqc	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	How much should my newborn be eating?	My newborn(5 days old) is a really great eater! She started off at the hospital at 2 ounces. Now she is up to 3-3.5oz. She seems like she wants more when she is done with the 3oz, but I'm not sure if I am supposed to give her that much. If she is acting like she is wanting more , do I give it to her or is there a limit to how much she should eat? Should I just feed her until she is satisfied no matter how much it is?  I am not breastfeeding by the way I am bottle feeding.

20081122213642AA50jv8	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Should I start a family now?	my husband is the bread winner in our household bringing home 65k a year. I do not work right now. We currently have about 15k in credit debt ( i know, we are crazy) and we own our own home. 3bed/2 bath. At the moment we have no car payments or student loans to worry about and make above (not much) the minimum payment on our credit cards. If we keep paying on the credit debts the way we are, we expect to be free of it within 2 1/2 to 3 years. usually after all of our bills we have 1200-1400 a month extra for gas, groceries and miscellaneous. Do you think that we are stable enough to start a family or should we hold off? I am curious as to what other people think of our financial situation and ages.    thanks. 
20081227223704AAXEdJ5	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Could I be pregnant??	My last normal period was nov. 7th. So, my next was due dec 7th. Im very regular. But, on dec 7th. I started spotting lightly enough for a liner but never anything else. That continued four days which is normally how long my period should be. Now Dec 27 I started spotting again. ten days before my next period would even be due. This time its even lighter than the last. I did have unprotected sex more than one time in the last two months. And i desperately want a baby. I plan on seeing if it starts and if it doesn't im taking a hpt. I was just wanting some input on the situation. Could the first bout with spotting have been a period? And i recently got pregnant or this just be a continuation? im so confused.
