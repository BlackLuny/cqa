rrrKPAZGaa	Because they get good commission from soft drinks companies....May be! Good question!|`|jjUcYwG3aa	It's weird that they can't sell anything else with their food. I just ask them to take it off and put on a water. Hope this helps!|`|AbQCkNHuaa	They do also sell water and juices. Just there main drinks are soda's. I believe they sell soft drinks with fast food because most people like soda. So they would usually buy that. I mean you never really see some one buy a water or juice.|`|JiRJQCHFaa	Because of how little it costs them to actually purchase.  The 12 oz of soda roughly equates to 12 cents for them.  A cup is about 3 or 4 cents so the 15 cents is costs them becomes your $1.30.  Pretty impressive markup hmmm?  Fries also follow a similar cost pattern which explains where combos come from.|`|Kc8sFjwraa	Most FF places now days Have Juice and other drinks    Speaking of juice I am drinking some now :)|`|hNa5oHxQaa	well the coke company and the pepsi company are contributors and they are popular.

For example, just this week, I got a coupon that is good for a buy one, get one free entree.|`|VXcp8hvHaa	nope|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	Sure! Just go up to the server and ask.
iwe9KUckaa	Ha, I do the the same thing with the waitress questions. I am currently working in a European-style cafe, with full coffee/tea service (served on a silver tray with an Austrian cookie, sugar, water, and a small spoon- very hoity), but we don't offer soft drinks. I always *ask* when someone has a low coffee if they'd like another, however, we do not give free refills on coffee, they can get one for $1, as our coffee is really expensive- moreso than Starbucks. People sometimes will get angry when I tell them this when they want a refill. I don't mind topping off a coffee, but I can't give them a second cup for free, otherwise I'll be paying for that refill from my tips.    While I agree, I don't like to sit with an empty soda if the place offer refills, I'm not angry if I do. Soda's generally are free refills, but on occasion they are not, and I appreciate if the server lets me know. Also keep in mind, there are times when the server has a bunch of other tables, and physically can't get over to a person who needs a million refills (some people drink shockingly fast!)|`|df9ec06e0d3a2b528115ca45bd1867bdaa	the way i did it was if i saw the glass was getting empty or was empty i would ask.. " would you like a refill?"   that gives them the option..   sometimes when my glass is empty i dont want a refill.. like when my sister and V and i go out for lunch or something.. i order one coke.. and that all the coke i want.. then i switch to ice tea.. so sometimes its good to ask.|`|MFZUaRQaaa	Most soda is over half ice so for 2 bucks you may get 4-6 oz. Yes I want a refill and get upset when there are only 2 or 3 tables seated and I have to ask for one. Now if the place is busy than I will tell them when they get a chance, I will take another please.|`|VDpmh2VJaa	yes they are sitll thirsty ...but at over 2.00 a wack per drink its best explain there may be a charge they may prefer water.|`|U4V6TkZEaa	If it is not free, then you might want to ask the customer if he wants to buy another one before you refill it.    But of course, everyone wants you to ask before they are empty, regardless if it is free or not. No one likes a lazy, inattentive server, and it is really awkward to call the server over if they are halfway across the restaurant flirting with the waitress.|`|097ec7f356872967e38438f8b2bde431aa	Its the standard in america to have free refils but if not then dont get them another one until they ask or ask them if they want another one|`|hNa5oHxQaa	Oh yes, free refills are great.  They are a great way to getting your money's worth.    I'd like another one please.|`|937d8516b6bac65675aebed05fbfdfc9aa	well customers may want to have drinks refilled without asking but waiters no better if you get a drink and did not ask them if they wanted it you can also get in trouble (people do complain about that )  but before it goes empty go to table and ask if they want another and dont wait to have them track you down for another drink|`|5qQPdUnhaa	I'd ask... I mean why get them a refill if they're about to leave and they have some pop left.? you're just waisting pop...|`|zYGJh5Odaa	even if they dont give refills u still want another one.|`|w5sK75MPaa	When my drink is gone I want another one. It does not matter to me if it cost more for a refill. Specially if Im drinking Dr. Pepper.|`|Lrf1NgUxaa	Usually every restaurant will give free refills on soft drinks so it's assumed that there will be no extra charge.  If the place you work at doesn't, make sure you mention it to them.  For alcoholic, milkshakes, and specialty beverages most people will assume that there are no free refills.  Water is almost always free so if they order water, keep em' full..|`|pUvEmPrCaa	This is assuming that all places give free refills.  If a server refilled my drink before I asked and it was not free, I would be upset.    It is assumed they are free if a server refills it without asking, but it is nice.|`|JiRJQCHFaa	Its pretty safe to say almost everyone expects free refills of fountain drinks and since the beverage itself only costs 1 cent per oz on average to the establishment charging extra for them would just be greedy on the company's part.|`|kedcv0glaa	What restaurants don't offer free refills...? I don't think there would be many left. If they charge you over $2 for a soft drink, then they should always offer you free refills. I think everyone assumes they do offer them because they don't run into places that don't.
