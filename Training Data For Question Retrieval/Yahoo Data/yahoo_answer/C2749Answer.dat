You need to be responsible & tell your parents.    Did you find it outside? If it was a stray, take it to the Humane Society-- the baby animals get adopted very quickly.    If someone gave it to you, give it back!    Tell your parents. They may let you keep it. If not, see if they will put it on craigslist-- we had a puppy that had a bunch of health problems & was getting too expensive to take to the vet all the time, so we put him on craigslist. He was "adopted" within the week. We were honest with the people who got him-- they knew he was sick.|`|K0uTjeWiaa	This is a life and this cat can die or be killed by the aspca. You need to tell your folks cause what will happen to the kitten if you don't can be much worse then what can happen to you|`|FrmKbM8waa	Give it to a rescue or the animal shelter u could also ask one of your friends who likes cats and ask if they want it or if they know anyone who dose.

The first thing you need to do is tell your parents the truth.  They may let you keep it.  I hope they do.    If they won't let you keep it, (and since it's not clear where you got it), you should take it back to the person who gave it to you.  If that's not possible for some reason, or you just found the kitten somewhere, ask your parents to take it to a cat shelter even if you have to keep it overnight to do that.  Until then, please don't put it outside--it most likely won't survive if you do.|`|xowm9t3kaa	You shouldn't have gotten a kitten you should put up adoptions signs and make sure he/she finds a good home|`|Y6Lj2qk6aa	tell ur parentz they mey say yes|`|K9SmiHX6aa	why would you do that to the poor cat
kg4aOcKeaa	congrats on adopting! and good luck    I would go to the library and get some books on housetraining, general training and dog care. you can't be too prepared.     if you want the dog to sleep in your room, i would use a crate(after you read some you will realize that it is the best thing to do for dogs and the easiest way to train, seems means but if done properly, the dog will love it) the crate will create a safe haven when tired or it wants to be alone, it will also keep him out of trouble and getting injured.     toys - there plenty of toys that are geared towards puppies because they are softer and more fun to chew for teething (get ones with little bumps and such) different dogs  will have different preferences so get a few kinds and see which the dog likes best. my dog likes rubber, boyfriends dog loves ropes.|`|3eUf3JBmaa	i personally think that the cairn puppies are really cute. :) but if you wanna find good dog toys you could try at petsmart. i also heard of a dog toy that is literally indestructible... it's made out of kevlar [bullet proof material that the cops, army, etc. use] and coated with a layer of rubber... i just can't think of what it's called, but maybe you'll be able to find it. but try this site...|`|aCqSF87Raa	Until the dog is potty trained and you KNOW they won't get into trouble (chewing wires, chewing up items, etc) they should be left in a crate (IE crate trained.) The best place FOR the crate is by the door to outside, so you remember the rush the puppy out first thing in the morning and right before bed.    As for toys: Nylabone, Kong, rope toys, tennis balls, squeaky toys    NO: rawhide, dental chews, edibles, easy-to-destroy toys     The first three can be given AFTER the pup has finished teething and after you have established that there are no stomach issues with the food or training treats.|`|RFfTjnxzaa	They're not telling me much about the Schnauzer, not even how old he is...    I definitely don't like the idea of 4-week-old puppies being spayed/neutered... I'd stay away from them: spaying or neutering too young can lead to problems later on.|`|JVvnET59aa	I like Scruffy!! He is adorable and you are AWESOME for adopting a rescue dog....congratss!|`|aqY13vWNaa	Okay, well, you could have your dog sleep in your bed, our buy him a bed and put it in your room, but put the bed in a corner of a room that is quiet, and doesn't get too hot or cold, it needs to be welcoming, but don't crowd the area, and make it his spot of the room, none of your personal items go their so your dog is welcomed. The link below is for an awesome toy my puppy has and he LOVES it!!!|`|vQ9U7bvwaa	well.. good toys would be squeaky things. i bought my dog a squeaky toy chicken and she loves it. also, plenty of chew toys becuase at one point in life, the puppies will end up with the uncontrollable urge to chew your furniture.     to get your dog to sleep in your room (im not sure if you want it to be up on your bed with you or not) but with my dog, it took a while, but eventually you should just be able to leave the door open or call the dog into your room.    hope i helped.    goodluck|`|16KUkMP0aa	If you want your dog to sleep in your room, just carry it when it's time to go to bed :]    My dog enjoys bones, pigs ears (gross lol), ropes and all dogs enjoy tennis balls!    Good luck|`|xPxm8ONiaa	Make sure the dog is house trained. Then he can sleep in your bed, i don't recommend it, unless your willing to be his leader. Eating before him, walking in front of him and such. And when you have a dog sleep in your bed, wash your sheets more often. :)    The toys, it depends on what your dog likes. My dog likes anything, but my aunts dog HATES squeaky toys.    I'd suggest to watch the dog whisperer, to learn how to be the pack leader. Good luck, and update us :)|`|KKWYLVbUaa	A very good thing to do would be to enroll in a puppy class through your local dog training club.     Puppies LOVE to chew, so chew toys are great.|`|701FO16zaa	personally I would go with the puppy, because there is less chance of it having pshycological problems when  its older. If you want it to sleep in your room, make a bed for him/her on the floor at the end of your bed. so then they know its your bed and not theirs. If you get the pup I suggest alot of chew toys ( so they wont be chewing on your furniture or shoes etc)... I learnt that the hard way lol.  They also love squeaky toys. although that could be annoying if they wake up in the night to play with it
UraITaK4aa	Well your hamster chews sticks to file down teeth. But I wouldent you would go through 5x's as much hamster food and thats more money to spend on hamster food.|`|ngo1pmlGaa	well honestly i wouldnt.

Oyb49z7Waa	Snails are active at night (nocturnal) so no worries there. The shell is a different story. The shell is made primarily of calcium and that calcium is obtained from the water snails live in. If you have soft water, it lacks minerals and one of those minerals is calcium.   Increasing hardness is pretty easily done and can be achieved by using water hardness products such as calcium carbonate, magnesium sulphate or calcium sulphate powders. When administering these products they may not immediately dissolve. A white sediment may settle on plants and ornaments but this will dissipate over a few days. Some clouding may also be experienced from the suspension of fine particles.|`|0b8c6deec73968ee5de1b69c2345788caa	the goldfish are trying to eat him remove him from tank

xGmbEzOZaa	In normal mutations, male zebra finches will have a red patch on their faces. In other mutations (pied, white, etc), you need to look at the beak. The males will have a brighter color beak than the females.    Society finches are more difficult to sex because both the genders look alike. The males will do a courtship dance, whereas the females won't. Also, the males will sing. Female society finches may sing (although it's a rare occurrence), so relying exclusively on song alone isn't the best choice. Obviously, the females are the only ones that lay the eggs.    If given a large cage, with plenty of flight room, you can keep zebra and society finches together.    It's possible for both species to be bred together. It's not really recommended because the offspring won't be a pure species. Not all finches breed at the same age. Generally the female should be at least one year old and the male should not be over five years old. A rule of thumb is that all finches should be at least 8 months old before being bred. Be sure that both the male and female are fed a nutritious diet and are healthy.|`|uIk9MAnDaa	well a male finch has orange on his cheek and a female does not or you can tell because the male has more of a red beak then a female

KLMo9jbzaa	Keep your cat away from him, Retarded is a Harsh word mentally challenged is more useful. He doesn't comprehend what he is doing so you the intelligent one should keep your cat away from him/her.|`|4TX26viFaa	How would you stop the retarded kid from punching a baby in the face. Do it the same way.  You're responsible for the health of your pet, I'd stop the kid instantly and make real sure he knew that what he did was wrong.  Even retarded kids can learn that.|`|cii9XShcaa	I doubt you are even old enough to have a child with the way you worded that statement. But if it's the truth, then have someone else punch you in the face while your retard is watching so the retard can learn to do it properly to you and not the cat.|`|cNHsQn2Raa	punch the kid in the face|`|WAilZ39maa	Tell him cats have feelings, too. Talk to him about how to be nice, and show him how to pet the cat and say "good kitty". If he's mentally challenged, he doesn't know what he's doing. But if he continues, take away a favorite toy and tell him he can have it back when he's nice to the cat. If he is, give it back. If not, take something else away. Keep doing it until he learns. Show him how nice the cat is and just keep showing him how to pet the cat gently.    Hope this helps and good luck.    PS - Please don't call mentally challenged people retards. That is very rude.|`|XzEGvaXjaa	Lol. You called your own kid retarded? That's awesome.    Anyway, the simple answer is to beat your kid. Not in a serious way like punching him in the face and the like, but in a disciplining way. There's nothing wrong with physical punishment as long as you don't take it to any extremes. If your kid is honestly retarded, then he probably doesn't understand what he's doing (or he could understand it quite well and not give a damn). Either way, a simple "go to your room" probably will not suffice 'cause they won't understand it. Pretty much every human being understands a little pain though and pain is the ultimate stimulus for molding behavior. Unless your kid is also masochistic, its best to just give him a few whacks on the behind whenever you see him do it.    However, there may be a more "new aged", politically correct way of going about it. I don't really know much about how to handle mentally challenged people (or kids) so there are probably plenty of other ways to change their behavior other than what you would do for an average child. At the same time, he may not be able to connect the pain with the idea that he's doing wrong and this could be a bad thing...    Try to research ways of disciplining mentally ill children.|`|9UZIgQvzaa	Give him a spanking every time he punches, hits, kicks, slaps, pinches, scratches, or anything else. Also ground him. Explain to him that cats or any other animal are not toys, or punch bags. Next time he does it he will have serious consequences.     Ground him, send him to his room, spank him, or give him a time out.     Cats may not have human feelings, but they can feel pain! :(    EDIT:    Ok, I thought you were just saying retard because you were mad. If he is mentally challenged, don't call him a retard. He doesn't know what he is doing is bad. Show him how to pet the cat nicely. If he hits the cat again, take away something he likes and don't give it back unless he is nice to the cat.      Hope I helped, and good luck.|`|Kg7B11ACaa	well.we know if the child is retarded he probably doesn't know what he's doing ..try to keep the cat in his own room..w/ food water and liter..be present when you r w/ the cat and try to show the child how to be nice..pet the cat and say nice kitty...if the child continues you may have to dicipline the child ..be consistant..good luck  thats a hard one..|`|ikzqudHTaa	teach by example. make sure the kid watches you as you pet the cat nicely.|`|DmUG33axaa	punch him in the face.. lol, you spelled retarded wrong too, so doubtful you have a really retarded kid|`|aCfxShPvaa	Just because he doesn't have the same knowledge capacity as a fully-functional human doesn't mean he can hurt an animal! It's a proven fact that people/kids who hurt animals often go on to become killers. You really can't take any chances with a case like this.     If he your own kid? If not- you need to tell his parents immediately. Inform them of what he is doing and tell them that this has to stop before you take this problem up with a higher authority. If this happens again: first, save your kitty (and then keep it indoors!)   Then, tell this kid to stop it be firm and harsh ( just think he'll start with cats, but next week that might be a kindergartner he's massacring)     I would call 911- inform them it's not an emergency situation and ask fro advice on what to do. This is a serious situation and this kids needs some direction or help. Like I said not only is he being horribly cruel (animals can feel pain!)- but his behaviour can just as quickly lead to hurting humans too.     I wish you the best of luck and act quickly before this problem escalates and you have a dead cat or a dead child due to this boy's out of control behaviour.
rrFbQZzIaa	Dragons enjoy climbing and digging. In a perfect world, if the cage had substrate w/ burrows in it like a hardened clay as well as ledges and wood to climb on, your dragon would be lovin it. The deep substate may be tough but atleast some sturdy wood for climbing as well as a hide. When they're adults, fake plants really aren't necessary as they're more for decorative purposes. You just have to be careful that they do not eat or ingest the fake plants or that the leaves are easily breakable.|`|vV425TqZaa	let me list the items that u will buy becuase these are the best and your beardie will love them:    -Larger food and water dish.    -You need one log for her to go under incase shes too hot or wanst to sleep somewere else for a change.    -substrate incase you dont know lol which u do.    -any extra/ u said shes only 4 months shes tiny if u have a top on her new home get a log that will reach like all around to the top shell love that.    -now on plants and bushes! only buy form PET STORE, if u get them form a normal store i guarentee she will get mites.
oT71QN8Raa	Talk to your local SPCA/humane society (no-kill), they will take them all in.  If you don't want to go that route, you can also put an ad in your paper for a fee, or talk to your vet.  Sometimes vets will take cats and keep them in their office, so people can take them.  I personally prefer the vets office or Humane Society.  With the vet, you know that who ever takes them is responsible enough to keep their animals healthy :) and if you take them to the Humane Society, well, cats have wonderful lives there.  They have lots of things to climb on and claw at and a bunch of other healthy cats to play with.      Before you go that route, try asking family and/or friends if they want to take them or if they know someone who might want to take them.  Please, do not advertise on Craigslist or any other internet site.  You don't always know who your babies are going too, considering a person can type whatever they want online.      Also...I apologize ahead of time if anyone start posting answers insulting you and saying you need to give your cats to people who will love them forever.  Some people are cruel and don't bother to consider that life changes and sometimes pets just don't fit into those life changes (as horrible as that is).  So don't let them make you feel awful.|`|yCR6qg0baa	www.CraigsList.org. We've had very good luck with that website with 3 pets:    We got a dog (a $1,000 shuh tzu) in March 2008. We took him to a vet the next day & he was actually very ill. The sellers wouldn't let us "return" him. We put an add (mentioning his illness) on Craigslist & another family adopted him within the week.     We decided to get a kitten shortly after that (so much less work) and we found her on craigslist for free. She's been an amazing pet.    We wanted to get her a playmate over the summer, so we got a male kitten. He was a TERROR. My gosh. He was like... a demon from hell. He destroyed our house. He clawed & bit everyone. He tormented our other cat & would provoke fights with her until she was hurt & bleeding. Nothing we did helped. we put up with it for 3 months & then put him on Craigslist. Someone got him 2 weeks later-- again, we were honest with them & told them what a demon he was. They e-mailed me a few weeks later to tell us that their kids love him & thanked us. (I guess he just couldn't get along with another animal or something).    If no one "adopts" them within 21 days, go ahead & take them to the humane society. But please, do your part. If you love your pets, you will not want them to stay in a little 3'x3' cage all day with no one to play with them & nowhere to run around. And older cats do not get adopted as quickly as kittens. So craigslist might be your answer.|`|KLMo9jbzaa	Put up flyers at your local SPCA, pet stores Veterinarians offices newspapers or any place else you can think of and make sure you post them with pics of the cats.|`|ikzqudHTaa	craigslist is a good place to rehome pets, just make sure that you screen potential adopters so that you can be certain that your cats won't be going to lab testing or baiting.    if at all possible,DON'T take them to a shelter. There are so, so many animals dropped off at shelters, many of which never get the chance to find new homes.     Cats don't require nearly as much attention as other animals such as dogs, so staying with you, even without a whole lot of attention, should be sufficient until you can find an adopter, and it certainly is better than leaving them at a shelter where they'll get hardly any attention and possibly be euthanized.
o93EwErKaa	You begin by having the dog x-rayed at about Day 55 and get your vet's opinion.    Here is a good link with warning signs on when to seek veterinary assistance during whelping.    http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/whelping.htm    If she has been having hard contractions for 2 hours, it is time to ring the vet.  If the contractions are mild, than it may be that they are not hard enough to move the dog down the birth canal and a teaspoon of vanilla ice cream will strengthen her contractions with the calcium and the sugar will give her additional strength.|`|tPGxPDvBaa	You don't.  That is a choice only a vet can make.  If your dog is pregnant, she should be getting health check-ups with your vet.  They can determine if she needs one & maybe not until delivery time.|`|JVvnET59aa	Well don't let her go more than 2 hours between puppies!! Goodluck.
rQlzfHqraa	A bovine is a cow and probably eats the most. Dear, domesticated as in spouse, would not eat the most and neither would deer the wild animal. Sheep will grease less than cows and porkers can eat a lot but I don't think they eat more by weight per day than a cow.

r8ETcmHMaa	I have a bci and she is great. They don't much care. Pretty much the same setup as a ball just with more heat a humidity. Mine is still a baby so I don't know how it is to handle a bigger snake yet. I do know it is more work once they get bigger so that something you should consider. Space,food,poop, there all thing that are bigger when the snake gets bigger. A cage for a full grown redtail cost upwards of 1,000 dollars. My friend made his own cage because his 12 foot bci out grown her old one. Her cage now is 10' 5' 7'. That bigger then a prison cell. Also food start to cost depending where you get it. You could spend 30 dollars on one meal. Don't get me wrong there great snake I just don't think its something for you right now only being 14. But hey if you have supportive parents willing to help then go for it. A dumeril boa would be a good choice. There docile but shy. They don't get that big. Male maxing around 6 feet and females around 8 feet. Also they don't need that much space. They actually like smaller enclosures. Well good luck.|`|aGH2B6lBaa	we have always had a boa constrictor. He eventually got so big that we had to give him away to a farmer and the last we heard was that they now feed him chickens! he got up to 6 1/2' in length. They are very nice creatures, just do not make them mad i have been bit at times. Go for it though, just make sure you are comitted and capable to having such a bigger snake|`|vS1Z0inOaa	Personally, redtails are kind of unpredictable. I mean, some are wonderfully docile, others are not. I mean, as a group any breed of snake has its individuals, but redtails to me don't fit any stereotype so to speak--they always seem to be individuals. If you want a snake that is a bit larger and more likely than not will be docile, I'd recommend an Eastern Chain King or a Bredli python. The Bredlis are my al-time favorites and are generally great with kids (supervised, of course) as they're gentle and rarely bite, but they can get up to 7 or 8 feet long. The Eastern Chain kings only get up to about 5 feet and are pretty good too though.|`|5wHCpGrHaa	get a red tail boa, they are so pretty. or a bemese python. or if you can find one, get one of those green pythons.

7lsU5bcoaa	Most dress sheets are only intended to be worn by horses part time, therefor do no thave the necessary leg straps for stabling or turnout. So the blanket can slip and the horse can get tangled. You need something that says turnout if your horse is going outside in it and at least a stable sheet if its going on overnight in a stall.    good luck!|`|RloOJ43haa	Only if it has leg straps to keep it in place if the horse rolls.|`|8rVodF9vaa	Probably not, but I don't know exactly which sheet you mean - my sale catalog is out in my car!! Dover has some dress sheets that they say can double as stable sheets, but even on stable sheets I want to be able to attach some leg straps.     If it has crossing belly straps, it would probably be usable as a stable sheet, I would sew  in some dee rings for leg straps. And obviously it would be for indoor use only.     if its this one http://www.doversaddlery.com/product.asp... it is listed as a stable sheet.

L22hVXTIaa	It's not possible to know how long your dog has left.  Obviously, she's fairly old for a Pug (the average life span is around 13-15 yrs) and considering her medical problems, probably not too long.  However, there are some effective meds for her hips and even the incontinence can be treated, but the bottom line is that you don't want her to suffer.  There's no guarantees in life for anyone, so we should live each day to the fullest and you should enjoy your girl while she's here and stop focusing on the end - it will come soon enough.  Take her to the vet and try to make her last years as comfortable as possible, and as full as possible.  Love her to pieces so that when it's time for her to cross Rainbow Bridge you'll have no regrets.      I finally had to let my dear old man go last April - he was 16 yrs. and after a debilitating stroke, there were no more options.   Best of luck and hugs to you and your girl|`|bIaywrBCaa	It is so hard waching your pet age and slowing down. I have 2 dogs that are the same age. So far they are doing well but are slowing down some. Talk this over with your vet. You can use doggy diapers on her but if course like wuith babies, that is also a mess to clean up. No one can say for sure when the end will come, but I think every pet owner knows when the time is right. When there seems to be no quality of life left. Just make the most of the time you have. Make good memories. Write a journal with your thoughts and feelings. Take lots of pictures. Do things with her that she really enjoys. God bless and take care.|`|4yv0iC85aa	I would recommend talking to your veterinarian. Hope Lilly is alright :)|`|JVvnET59aa	The average lifespan of a Pug is 13 years.

yCR6qg0baa	How old is she? Was she using the litter box at her family's house before you got her?     It's VERY simple. If she's small, get a small litter box (you can always get a bigger one later). Let her watch you pour litter into it. Then pick her up, put her in her litter box, hold onto her front paws, and move them in a digging motion. You're teaching her to dig & subconsciously, she knows "Ok, I poop here".    We got our kitten at 6 weeks old. She was potty trained IMMEDIATELY. She had one accident-- the 2nd night we had her, she was in our room with the door closed (snuggled up with my husband) & her box was in the other room. She was getting whiny, but we ignored it thinking it was b/c she was so little... The next morning, my husband woke up and was like, "Ewww... my leg is wet!" Poor little thing had peed on him! I was like, "Oh, you probably just got sweaty in your sleep. So he went to work & while I was making the bed, lo and behold there was a big yellow stain on the sheets haha =)    Edit: I don't know why all these people are saying, "Put her in her box & don't let her out till she pees." That's incorrect. You must dig her paws around in the litter. She'll instinctively know.|`|K0uTjeWiaa	I use an open box   Just put it in the litter 5 minutes after eating and other times occasionally. It won't take long|`|KLMo9jbzaa	Just put your kitty in and cross your fingers and eventually they learn to use it.

It hard.|`|OUcQjqI0aa	use an open box. introduce the kitten soon after you bring it home, and put it in there after it eats, it will get the message pretty quickly.    the kitten may have accidents. one tip, if the kitten farts, put it in the litter box, it has to go   2|`|Kg7B11ACaa	i always put the liter box by the food and water ..after getting home w/ your new kitten put it in the liter box right away..then feed it and when he's done put him back in the liter box..do this for a couple of day's  also put him in the litter box randomly during the day..most cats are very receptive to this method..be consistent..cats are very smart and very clean animal's   good luck w/ you're new kitten   don't forget to spade or neuter your cat at 6 month's ..also it's shots..they'll do it at the same time....have a great time w/ your new baby|`|DmUG33axaa	i have always trained mine, and got them the first time, by putting them in the litter box, and using my had took her front paws and kinda made her paw and the litter, just show her how to do it, and they usually figure out its fun and go, its there natural instinct to paw before they potty. lol|`|ikzqudHTaa	Kittens will usually use a litterbox automatically once they have been introduced to it. To introduce them, simply pick up the kitten and set it in the litterbox. After this, the only reason that a kitten will be peeing elsewhere is that something else (such as the dirt in a potted plant) resembles litter, or if they can't make it to the box in time for some reason (such as getting stuck somewhere), or if there is something offensive about the litterbox (such as if you haven't cleaned it recently).    Overall, cats are very very easy to litterbox train. They are naturally inclined to use litter. So, just make sure that your kitten always has access to its box and that the box is kept clean and you shouldn't have anything to worry about!    oh- one more thing- for young kittens, never use clumping litter. they have a tendency to eat it and have it clog up their digestive system, making them very sick.    And the main advantage to hooded boxes is that they don't stink up rooms so much.|`|utWwwIpkaa	The kitten will know how to use it.  -Put the kitten it GENTLY. So its not a scary experience.  -move its paw a little so it can see its a place to dig.  -If you just got the kitten keep putting it it in every 20 30 Min's or so. just to remind it, were it is in the house. After that it will probably want some privicey.   - Keep the litter box in the same place for the first week so it can always find it.  -Keep the litter box in a completely different room than its food is kept in (they don't poop where they eat).  -A young kitten might not like the hood on the box take it off if it finds it scary.  -completely changing the litter every day works best for odour, and ironicly, cats only want to 'go' in a clean litter tray. The tray doesnt need to be over flowing. but needs enough to cover everything.  Cheep litter works fine, no need to waste money.    Its very unusual for a kitten to have accidents, they are not like puppies.    Good Luck!!
AMjMeigMaa	Anytime I chop onions and my hands smell, I pour lemon juice on my hands.  It really works for that.

rQlzfHqraa	Your ducks are fine as they swim in freezing water and probably get pink webbing. A duck will lay 6 to 8 eggs taking at least 9 to 10 days and then she will set. They should hatch around day 28 from the time she starts incubation. Duck are very hardy but in freezing weather don't count the ducklings before they hatch.
JpdVidqxaa	Adequan shots can work wonders for some dogs.  It does not do much for others.  But is well worth a try.  It is given in a series of shots, but if you do not see improvement after the first few shots, then you do not need to continue.  If they are going to work, you will see improvement after the first couple of shots.  Good luck.
BVwDoV81aa	Your dog may have skin atopy.     He will need to be tested to see what exactly he is allergic to, this is done in conjunction with vet advice.     The first thing they do is look at the dogs diet and will give you advice on best food and any supplements that may help as well as any restrictions and special breed needs.     Next is house and lifestyle ie carpets, furnishings, bedding, textiles and amount the dog is living indoors in centrally heated type houses. The biggest enemy being the house dust mite. Prolific cleaning, vaccum daily(yes daily), keep dog off bed and sofas, wash all bedding/towels at 60 degrees (which kills dust mites). Other such things as restricting use of VOC's and sprays used for cleaning products and all other household smellies that get into a dogs system and break it down can cause severe problems.Just use mild detergent and hot soapy water to clean surfaces. You'll also save loadsa money.    Once all this has been done for a number of months (3-6 months) and nothing found and condition worsening then they can do a series of test prick injections over the dog on a shaved bit which can then identify specific products/mites that may be contributing to the problem and then give monthly injections to help build his immunity to the thing that was found.  It can be a long haul but its worth it for the comfort of the dog for the quality of his life. The itching drives them crazy as the body producing antigens goes into hyperdrive. The licking can become behavioural and go onto chewing and biting and breaks the skin and then becomes infected.   Do try to stop him licking as it will increase as this goes on. Be gentle and patient, he will be in distress at times and driven to distraction, he may be temperamental and could get quite growly too if approached.    Viacutin supplement (essential fatty acids)in his food from vet may help to start with.Vet can give you shampoo too.    Oh yes -make sure you are insured, none of this is going to be cheap, if your dog has skin atopy then its a systemic condition and can lessen his overall immunity and will need lifelong vet care.    best wishes|`|o93EwErKaa	He may have a food allergy so it would be worth testing this theory out by feeding an allergenic food like California Naturals or Natural Balance with only two ingredients.  Choose a different protein source than the one you are currently feeding that he has not been exposed to.  Beef, corn, soy and wheat are the most common foods dogs are allergic to.    I would also suggest adding Omega 3 fatty acids to the diet with Salmon oil (available at petstores) or fish oil capsules.  About 1500 mg for a dog of his size.    The "gray bumps" are simply callouses which are common in large dogs.  You can prevent them or keep them by getting worse by giving the dog a soft place to lay.  I use a twin size mattress for my 150 lb. Malamute.|`|JVvnET59aa	Try changing his diet. Omega 3 fatty acid supplements are available and really help with skin problems. Bathe him in oatmeal shampoo or hypoallergenic shampoo. If none of these seems to help, he may need to have allergy shots weekly from the vet!|`|zguucR8yaa	Omega 3 fatty acids can do wonders, fish oil too. A veterinarian once told me to use tuna oil ( from canned tuna ).   Ask your veterinarian how much to give according to your dog's weight. If you're not giving enough, it won't do any good.|`|5b697ae5264bc19d33f3ae5c96b9fb0caa	You need to be careful of different shampoos. Oatmeal has a drying agent in it and the skin is already dry. I raised West Highland terriers. They seamed to be notorious for having skin problems. Many of these skin problems have been created by the owners bathing them too frequently, and using the wrong shampoo. I used Dr Bronner's Equliptus shampoo. It has vitamin E and more good oils in it. The use of this helped cure any rash that they had. Also it would stop itching  I'm a firm believer in this soap. You can order it on line. The Equliptus sent helps to repel fleas. Some dogs are allergic to fleas. I hate the use of Steroids in a dog. I also would try a natural lamb and rice food.|`|JpdVidqxaa	He could have allergies.  You may want to try switching foods.  Lamb based foods usually are good for dogs with allergies.  He also might be allergic to the shampoo that is being used.  Try a shampoo for sensitive skin with oatmeal and tea tree oil.  He may also be allergic to grains or cleaning solutions used in the home.  Try making some switches and see if it helps him.

SytfXV6Haa	What your describing sounds like your cat is doing a body posture called lordosis which is associated with cats that are in heat. Is your cat spayed? If not then it most certaintly can be in heat.  Especially if she has become very vocal (more than normal). Cat Heat Cycles can occure every two days to three weeks. If you do not want to deal with this I would suggest getting your cat spayed.|`|bxlYleZkaa	She is in heat....|`|lU8e0VQFaa	It really does sound like she's in heat, be careful or you'll have every male cat in the neighborhood beating down your door.|`|KLMo9jbzaa	Go here maybe you might find your answer.    http://www.google.com/search?q=things+ca...|`|jWgGy0NLaa	Take her to the vet i think shes be pregnant|`|WebaFPgsaa	She's either: -Really happy                     -In heat                     -Pregnant  But I would check with the vet either way.|`|Xj4bTobUaa	She may be pregnant, my cat acted strangely just before she gave birth|`|utWwwIpkaa	It really does sound like your cat is in heat.

kWwgWSSgaa	Dobermanns can be extremely hard to train *if* they don't respect you. As a junior, between 9 ~ 18 months old, your hitherto obedient Dobermann is likely to decide to see if you really mean what you say & test the boundaries. This stage does pass, but can be very trying.    Your Dobermann *must* know its place in the pack & that's at the bottom. If your Dobermann detects any leniency, inconsistency in maintaining the boundaries of acceptable behaviour, it will be perceived as weak leadership & your Dobermann will not respect you.     As Dobermann are a sensitive breed, but with very much a mind of their own, as an owner you should be firm, but never harsh, consistent & fair & remember to be as quick to praise when you Dobermanns obeys your commands, as you are to punish.    The UK Dobermann Club does not recommend castration until the dog is at least 18 months old, as it may hinder its physical development.  Join your local Dobermann club if there is one close by. A fantastic source of information & some hold training sessions.    If you buy a fleece dog coat & if it's icy, a pair of sturdy dog boots, your Dobermann should be fine.|`|AA12126470	Well lets start with the doberman and the cold.  I live in Iowa and it gets cold here. I do not leave my dogs outside for an extended period of time. They are fine.   Dobermans need lots of exercise. Most really need more than 2 walks per day. They need to be run and played with hard. They enjoy rough play and they love to run. They are not the best apartment dogs.   Also they are on most banned breed lists for insurance and if you are planning on renting you better make sure you can find a property that will take a doberman most will not.   Our rescue requires a fenced in yard to adopt a dog. It is a deal breaker for us.  Dobermans are not hard to train but they need a dominant person to be the one in charge. You must set rules and boundaries and stick to them. You also have to back up the rules. If you do not the dog will run the house. If you are  on or tend to be on the lenient side a doberman will be alpha and then you will have huge problems.   I do behavioral consultation for our rescue. I go in and solve problems and issues.   If I had a penny for every time I heard someone wanted a doberman because  they are gorgeous I would be rich beyond my wildest dreams. That is a bad reason to get a dog.|`|xPxm8ONiaa	About the weather, many people have dobermans in new york, and in Canada. Just, when you walk him, give him a jacket, and boots, so he doesn't get frost bite. (And i don't mean get a closet full of cute hats, pants, sweaters, tshirts, and such).    About the exercise, as long as your dog gets a daily walk, he should be fine. But Dobes are high energy dogs, so i would suggest buying a treadmill, so he can burn of extra energy.    And about your other dog. Get the doberman as a puppy, and have it neutered when it is 6 months old. Also, when you choose the puppy, get the more laid back one. These two things will prevent your doberman from trying to be the alpha male.    I hope i helped, good luck :)|`|YJBpCu3iaa	welll i have a doberman n ive had him ever since he was a puppy & im from boston =]  Dobermans are great dogs.   move to boston its much better than new york esp. for a dog lol
Wn3LGHTvaa	Sandpaper might work if it were firmly attached to something that won't move when the snake rubs up against it. Try a large, rough rock instead. Raising the humidity in the cage will help too.|`|b9c206476271de6c0a321ebe042eb7f6aa	Nope.  Sandpaper is too harsh.    Put a nice granite rock in there.|`|nooi0ldjaa	not the best idea, small bits could be eaten. your better off putting in a large rock in there for her to rub on.    while a bath might sound like a good idea, sticking your hand in a cage to get a animal thats getting ready to shed is not...a lot more likely to bite.  and they get stressed out much more easy.|`|e72e23aed155f72d1b8966dc2699bd7caa	No. Spraying her with water or a shedding aid will help her. Also, if there is wood in the cage that she climbs on, it should help her shed excess skin.|`|5wHCpGrHaa	no its not a good idea. you shouldnt do that. its better if you let the process take its time. and never peel the skin off yourself, you could rip the scales off|`|ZSWmOkE6aa	That wouldn't be such a good idea. The best thing to do when your snake is shedding is to give her a bath or spray her. As long as the humidity is right you shouldn't have a problem with her. And also make sure that there is something in her enclosure for her to rub her skin on.|`|rrFbQZzIaa	no, that would be a really bad idea. If you give your boa a bath, or mist or moisten the cage, that will be all that it will need. If you have some kind of rock, or a hard surface in the cage for the boa to rub against, that would also be great.
nINl1ynhaa	I see nothing wrong in that, its no different to people wanting to change their names by "deed poll".|`|lhOd2hvXaa	You can always rename a dog regardless of age.  If there was an age limit for changing names we would have a terrible time in rescue (where 9 times out of 10 we don't even know a dogs name to begin with).    Just pair the new name with the old name for a while an eventually drop the old name.    Good Luck!|`|cETQuE9waa	It's never to late to change her time. It will take her a little time to adjust to her new name.|`|9011c787ebf4ea3d0b73a7f282338f19aa	you should pick and keep a name befor 5 months|`|B8Gwxo1laa	No it's not. We adopted a 2 yr.old Retriever mix, I don't know what his name was before, but he quickly adapted to the new name we gave him.|`|L22hVXTIaa	It's never too late to change a dog's name - look at all the dogs in shelters that are found or abandoned - no one knows their name so it's up to the new owners to pick one.  It may take a little while for him to get used to the new name, but use it often and he'll catch on.|`|vQ9U7bvwaa	no. my dog was a year when we got her, and we changed her name. she learnt it within a week or two.    goodluck|`|gB79twqfaa	No, it is not too late to name your puppy, though you should do it as soon as possible. Call her the name as much as you can in everyday sentences so that she can get used to the name.|`|A9qDWpXUaa	It is never too late to change a dogs name, it is just another word he responds to. My last dog was 2 1/2 when I got him and I couldn't live with the name he had (Leo) so changed it.     The method I used was to assosiate responding to his new name with treats, I said his name - he looked at me - he got a treat and within a day he was happily responding to his new name and as we never used his old one there was no confusion.|`|hKLEnKFPaa	Its not too late...you can try calling it by whatever name you choose when it's time for it to eat or when you give it a treat.
kM2HNuziaa	Well basically any kind of dog will get along with a shitzu. It just depends how well they no each other. Like i have a cat who hates other animals and then we got a dog, she hated the dog but now that they no whats happin with eachother they are like best friendz and stuff so just get any kind of dog that makes you happy and stuff like that, so once they get to no eachother i think they will be fine!

U1RcZjqJaa	I am an owner of  a pitbull (which is basically the same breed) and they have naturally good physiques. We walk her daily and she plays with our other dog all day and stays in perfectly good shape. She is basically pure muscle. I don't know if we could get her to put on fat if we tried! As for training, we just use consistancy and treats. As a breed they are very eager to please their owners so training shouldn't be difficult at all. It really depends on what you are trying to train them to do.|`|AA11155563	hi. it depend on the age of your dog if he is still young dont worry to much it will come in time.  if he is old and overweight then he needs more exercise and less food.  try if you can to feed him the best diet you can sensibly afford something like hills or pro plan but dont add anything to it as it will unbalance the complete food..cut out all treats and snacks and get walking with him or running if your able.go to your local pet shop as they can advise you keep away from pets at home or jolleys as the staff there are useless and are only working there because mac donalds rejected them.lol|`|hB1SkPqRaa	Why do you want to do that is probably a better question?|`|WyXr6Idmaa	I know what you mean.

I remember his youth, when his now dull coat once shown in dapples in the sun light.  I remember his look, observant, working things out as he learned his leads, his anticipation of the next jump or the steer coming out of the chute.  The anticipation is now gone, waiting for the time to come for a turn out, a chance to take his old body out and stretch the legs that carried us over fences, down trails and watched the "kids" learn so we could save money for his replacement.  Neither of us are as young as we'd been in those days.  My bones don't mend as easily either.  We're BOTH older for the wear and much wiser.

xGmbEzOZaa	If your bird was bred in captivity, there should be an identification ring on him. On the ring should be a number indicating his hatch date. Otherwise, an avian veterinarian can estimate his age via a blood test.    Edit: It sounds like your bird was most likely an import. The United States has stopped importing parrots from other countries since 1992, so your bird is probably 17 years old or older. All I can tell you from the numbers, is that your bird's quarantine facility was in Florida. The USDA never printed rings with ages on them. The import rings just indicate the quarantine facility. Like I said, take your bird to an avian veterinarian and ask him/her to give you an estimate of your bird's age. Amazon parrots can live to be 50 years old, at average.    The lifespan can vary between the individual bird and the care it receives while it was alive. The oldest known Amazon parrot died at age 117.

Or at a store?  Don't ask "the guy at petsmart."  He filled out an application, got the job, shows up on time and has bills to pay.  He's a fish expert because a chain store happened to be hiring?      He's doing his job, which is to sell you some stuff.  If you want actual advice, ask some actual aquarists.         And a tank THAT "huge"?  A 2.5 or 5 gallon tank is considered TINY- most aquarium stores don't even stock them.    How about consulting a fish website, not an online store?

Bowls are terrible habitats for fish. They offer no swimming space, no filtration and no heating. The fish would be swimming in stagnant, waste filled water.

The people advertising that thing for bettas should be arrested, in my opinion.    And if a guy at Petsmart told you a four-inch bowl was suitable for a betta, he's either criminally stupid or just plain criminal. He's probably one of those idiots who tells people they can put five goldfish in a two-gallon bowl, too.    If you get a decent sized betta container, change the water at least once a week.  If you get that tiny bowl, you won't ever need to change the water, because you can't keep a fish alive in that bowl anyway.|`|H9Nvo2gxaa	NO!

They'd be happy to sell you a new betta every 6 months, and claim bettas don't live long*.  Which is what will most likely happen if you keep a betta in a tiny bowl.  The only way it ever works is you change the water every 2 days, and keep the water temp at 75-85F.  Also you'll need to be careful not to over feed      Ideally you want a 2.5-5 gallon filtered tank with a heater.  With this setup you could simply make 20% water changes every week or so.  Also the betta would have space to swim around a bit.    *Mine live 3 years easily, and the one in the store are 6-12 month old.  (barring disease)|`|LMflh3C4aa	What do you mean, that huge?  2.5.  Notice the decimal point.  That's less than 3 gallons.  Bettas are actually one of the only fish that can be kept in a tank as small as a 2.5, so it is by no means "huge".  Small dirty puddles is a common myth, I can't believe they are allowed to put that when they are selling something.  They come from Thailand (formerly Siam, thus their name), where they were originally in still lakes and slow moving streams.  Eventually, someone figured out they were great at eating mosquitoes and other bugs, so they were moved to rice paddies for that purpose.  They never lived in puddles.  Also, Thailand is a very tropical place, so they need a heater to keep the water 76-82 degrees f.  and the smallest body of water you can reliably, safely heat is 2 1/2 gallons, thus why it is a minimum size for them.  You will just fry them if you try to keep them in that thing, or freeze them, besides having to clean it every day and it not being enough space to move.  You'll be lucky if your Betta lasts months in that, instead of the years it will live if you get it a proper tank.|`|Dp1CZiJ4aa	It's pretty small. I suggest getting a bigger tank or bowl, because your betta will be happier and you won't have to clean the tank as much. Really get a bigger one. Hope this helps.|`|Hxa0lXb3aa	2.5 gallons is the minimum. (i prefer 5 gallon) with a filter and heater. In a bowl you can't put those stuff. You need a tank. You will kill your Betta in about 3months if its lucky. Research before getting any fish.|`|qAwnAYGAaa	This bowl looks pretty small to me.  I think you should get something a little bit bigger.|`|9YCrqlMiaa	Actually, bettas live in PADDIES. Not PUDDLES. There's a big difference, like their environment is. I would suggest that you get a 2.5, some might argue that a 5 gallon tank is better for the betta. Get a filter, and a heater. That should probably cost you all together $30 bucks for a tank, heater and a filter. You might have a harder time finding a heater since they don't make a lot of heaters that small for that tank.|`|NHs3LxlLaa	I knew the answer as soon as I saw the question, the picture just confirmed it. NO!    Petsmart is NOT a local fish store nor an experienced fish breeder. Many websites will say that Betta's can live in this bowl so you should buy this bowl from us. That is not true. Betta's need a minimum of 5 Gallons to be happy and thrive, 2.5 Gallons to survive. I have drinking cups bigger than this that still aren't suitable for Betta's.    I mean look at the size of the Betta compared to the "bowl". He can't move or anything. How would you like to be stuck in your toilet for your whole life?    Get a larger tank please.|`|ThAhxR7waa	I'd literally punch someone in the face if I saw them trying to keep a Betta in something like that.     Look at it this way: Lets say we put you in a tiny metal box. You can't get out, but you have just enough room to stand up and turn around. We slip you a cup of water and a piece of bread every day.  Would you live? Probably.   But would you call that 'living'?    As others have said, 2.5-5 gallons at MINIMUM.   Of coarse the Petsmart guy and the people trying to sell you that pathetic excuse for a bowl are going to make it out like it's totally fine. They're the ones getting your money. That's their job.    And FYI, 2.5 gallons isn't exactly livin' in the lap of luxury either, although it's fine enough to keep them moderately happy.   Places like THIS are where Betta typically live outside of captivity: http://www.siamensis.org/images/article_...

B6zl0AJDaa	What you're saying is that a 14" and 18" SEAT fits your pony.  Seat size has NOTHING to do with if it will fit your pony and a horse.  What you need to find out is the tree sizes for BOTH, which I'd bet is probably a medium to wide tree.  The only way you'll know if they fit is if you try them on the horse.  The saddles would probably fit a TB or Running QH type horse.    BTW to correctly measure yourself for a saddle that fits, you need to start at your knee and measure up to your hip.  That will give you the correct seat size.|`|iiNAJfGCaa	The seat size of the saddle is mean to fit YOU, not the pony. The only thing that influences the horse is the size of the tree, the width of the gullet, the spine clearance, and the flocking of the saddle itself.|`|EghHVkHEaa	The size is for YOU not the horse. 14" will be very small, while an 18" is HUGE!|`|fa27c3346599fbfc609df0721c669bd4aa	The seat size doesn't matter.  It all depends on the size of the tree.  A welsh is more likely to be wider then an Arab for instance so you might need a regular or wide tree saddle.  Or your Arab may need a narrow tree.  Most Quarter Horses need a wide or regular tree.  With western saddle's it goes by Full or Semi-Quarter Horse bars.  I find that you need a very stocky horse with no wither to fit full quarter horse bars on.
XI2iylR4aa	I am very pro-spay/neuter.    I don't think that flat-out mandating spaying or neutering is the best way to go.  There would always be exceptions to the rules.  In cases where the procedure is likely to kill the animal, of course I don't think neutering should be mandated.    However, I think that some sort of fee should be imposed on people who decide not to neuter.  Right now, people are responsible for the cost to neuter their pets.  I doubt that will change.  But I think that people who decide NOT to neuter should also have to pay.  Ideally, the fees would make it cheaper to have a neutered pet than an intact pet.      Of course, I don't know how they would implement such a system, but I'd love to see the money stay in the animal welfare sector.  I sincerely believe that neutering prevents many more problems than it causes.|`|4TX26viFaa	The spay neuter choice does have a lot of controversy. You have more aggressive male dogs if they're not neutered, and if the owner doesn't know how to train the dog that's a disaster waiting to happen.    There are also the people who dump puppies and kittens at the shelter repeatedly, every year, because they don't spay/neuter their animals. This puts a strain on the entire system trying to find homes for the animals.    IF you're a responsible owner and control your animal and don't add to the unwanted puppies and kittens, then fine.  However very few people do fall into that category, considering what the shelters have to deal with today.|`|rQlzfHqraa	The only responsible reason to leave pets natural (not spayed or neutered) is if your are breeding them. They get loose or other animals come around and no one has complete control all the time. We already have too many pets needing owners. Your reference material is only one opinion.|`|RKZHGqh7aa	I am pro spay/neuter but I don't have a problem with people not spaying/neutering as long as they are responsible and don't have their dogs spewing unwanted puppies everywhere lol.|`|psqkf6rMaa	its your choice some times you have to|`|hMYT11ucaa	You should always spay/neuter pets. The time I think you shouldn't is if you are a breeder or the vet says not to. I live in a small town, population 100,000, and every year our pound puts down Thousands of dogs and cats ( last year we put down 1,200 unwanted cats and the number is going to go up this year). Many of the cons on that page can be avoided with a healthy diet and daily exercise. Always spay or neuter.
EghHVkHEaa	Working trot or Trot: the natural trot of the horse when under saddle. The stride length is "normal" for the horse ;some breeds have naturally shorter or longer strides. It is a gait between the collected trot and medium trot. Medium trot is a trot that is more engaged and rounder than the working trot, with moderately extended strides. It lies between the working and the extended trot. The horse has good, solid impulsion. Hope that helps.|`|y7H1V39Jaa	The other answerer described the working trot, I will describe the working walk.  It looks as though the horse has a job to do and knows where he is going and is eager to get there...one hiccup faster would be a trot but he maintains a four footed walk....picks them up and lays them down, usually in a western class, the reins will be swinging from side to side from the momentum...lots of judges love this.
IMPvzBk1aa	All human conveniences aside, the horse can balance himself more easily during the ride in a slant load than a straight load trailer.|`|Pm8nsCGZaa	Its a bit different for the horse, backing out. The advantage to slant is you can haul more horses in a shorter length trailer. They say horses like it better.  The one thing I always worry about in a slant is if i get t-boned by another vehicle on the head sie of the trailer. :-(|`|DmUG33axaa	horses seem to like slant load trailers better, they are more open when they get in and they feel more comfortable. plus it is much easier for them to balance in a slant load because if you it the brakes hard they are not being flung forward. horses actually prefer to ride backwards. i have had both and have never had a horse balk at the slant load. but size has a lot to do with it also, not very many horses will load in a two horse without any problems.. but if you are buying a trailer, i would go with a slant.|`|uNIHqmH8aa	Horse's have their preferences just like people. I know my friend's horse like straight load because he is blind in one eye. My horses don't care. The only thing I can say is to make shore that you ALWAYS have it set up so the horse can't get out the people door. There was a slant load that a girl had at a show and nothing to block the horse from the people door. To keep it simple, she was badly hurt and trampled when the horse was spooked.    -Nov|`|5i8lDbXfaa	I prefer slant loads, easier to load multiple horses and the horses balance better.  My horse was loaded in a straight, two horse one time, and when the person (not me) went to unload him he forgot to untie the lead rope first and when my horse stepped out he slipped from still being tied still and scraped his back legs pretty bad.      I think they also get better air circulation in a slant load.|`|yQIOXv5Yaa	not really, except that some horses who are used to one kind will have a hard time with the other.|`|A3sL0BJRaa	not really.  Easier for you to get out when loading multiple horses.  Uh, normally they cant travel with food in front of them to keep them occupied.  It is easier to turn around in there if your horse wont back out.
a2cjwMKcaa	There is no fixed rule, although I'm sure the 1" of fish per gallon 'rule' will be trotted out again.    However, In this case it's actually not too bad. 10-20 small fish (1-2") will be fine assuming they are compatible.    With small fish you may be able to keep more, but get the tank well established and monitor the water quality for a while before you go beyond that number.    Ian|`|yV8fog7Paa	no matter what, if you want mollies make it mollies only because they are killers.    I'd suggest a couple of corries (about 4-6) and 2-3 snails (apple or mystery)     Basically any tropical fish will due as long as it doesn't get over 2.5in    they say they are peaceful. I had 6 mollies and all of them killed eachother. I had 2 dalmation mollies and some other molly and they killed eachother and everyone else. I had a black and a gold molly and together they killed my fish and 7 of my teachers fish (since I gave them to her but she gave them back) then the black one killed himself XD  then I got 3 more gold ones because the 1 goldfseemed lonely. They were fine for an hour or two, then the one started bullying, then the others were sent back to my house and they bullied each other.   they are not peaceful.|`|Dp1CZiJ4aa	Up to about 14 fish would what I would put in there.|`|9YCrqlMiaa	There is a limit, but it varies greatly by what you put in there. Basically, a bigger and better filter will let you have more fish. Some of the fish i'd recommend for a 20G are the livebearers, tetras, barbs and some of the corydoras catifsh.  A school of corydoras pygmaes/habrosus would also look good in a tank for you.|`|PlBHhU3Kaa	get tetras like red- eye tetras and cardinals and neons and a coolie-loach  and african butterfly fish    http://www.aquahobby.com/gallery/e_panto...|`|Iw6vqJd8aa	Ok, you have almost everyone's opinion. Here are a couple of websites that will let you chose the ones you want. Most of the barbs and tetras are good choices. Also a couple of cories (catfish) for the bottom. Had to throw in my opinion.

ikzqudHTaa	It depends on how much talking you want your bird to do. Some birds imitate short sounds, while other birds mimic long phrases and yet other birds can even understand basic parts of human speech. If you are looking for a bird that TRULY talks, rather than just mimics, then an african grey is your best bet. Try checking out this video about Alex the african grey (a famous bird in experimental linguistics studies) who learned and understood a large number of words and phrases before his death. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6KvPN_Wt...|`|xGmbEzOZaa	Most parrots can talk, although some species are better talkers than others. Parakeets can be taught to talk, however their voices are raspy sounding. Crows and mynah birds talk as well.    Edit: It's a cruel myth that splitting a crow's tongue will allow it to talk. It's not necessary at all!|`|FGn8okQQaa	Get a Squawkers McCaw, or find human friends.  With real birds, not only is there no way to guarantee that any individual will talk, but also they need so much work and attention to keep happy and healthy, they are loud and will bite when annoyed, scared, or hormonal, you can't use scented things or anything with PTFE/Teflon around them, and they can have very long lifespans, depending on the species.  Also, you need a good avian vet.  It won't be good for you or the bird if you get a live animal solely for something that it might not even do.  I can't even emphasize how much more there is to a pet bird than just talking ability.|`|hUFYsfe6aa	um Pairats   and crows( u have to get them when they are little and slit their tong not in half just slit the top of it. i havent tryed it but that is what my mom said)|`|mzH1xJpoaa	mostly that i know is a parrot !!|`|fQ3d5iAWaa	Most of Parrots and most of birds can talk. parakeets can talk, but the way they talk is much different that a cockatoo can. And every bird can be thought how to talk, you just need to give them attention. So pick which ever you like, and spend time with him/her. Now for more help males are better learners that female in every bird.
e334d47d0cf581231e2545cccfc166e2aa	I would pay the extra to ensure she gets some good turnout time every day.  Too much time in a stall opens the door for stable vices because of boredom, and breathing and hoof problems.  I think her getting several hours of turnout time a day should be the most important factor in your decision (as it sounds like it is).    Since she is 3 years old, she probably has some extra energy to expend, and getting that out will be VERY important when you start to ride her.  A newly broken horse will be bad enough as it is - you don't want one that's been cooped up for 23 hours a day and bursting with energy.    Also, it would be kind of nice to have someone else do the work for you so if you can't make it one day, it's no problem.  When you start riding, it will allow you extra time to spend with your horse, not just on taking care of her.    The other possibility, if you can talk to the other self care boarders in advance, is to form some sort of schedule with them, so that the responsibility for the care and turnout of all the self care horses rotates by day between the owners.|`|RoDjZKknaa	You have to think more of your horse than yourself.  Sorry.  you have a 3 year old, your horse needs to have as much turn out as possible.  He/she needs to have time to "be a horse", and that is not not being stuck in a 12X12 or a 12X24 for 23 hours a day.  That is not a horse's natural environment, and we humans do a lot to destroy a horse's natural instincts.  This can lead to a variety of destructive and annoying habits.  Do what is best for your horse and find a place where he/she can be out most of the day, especially if you are not going to be there to work him/her. Trust me, they would rather stand in the rain in a pasture then be stuck for 2 days in a stall.|`|a297uH97aa	If I had the option to have my horse close by but with a slight increase in board I would do so.  By having her closer you will be forced to go to see her every day.  The cost differance is minimal from self to full board so its fully up to you.  I myself have done both ways, the full board is quite nice as you have the option to come and go as you please and vacations etc are much easier to plan.  However you are relying on others to care for your animal and it will limit your contact with her.   By having self board you will be responsible for her as well you will be the one to have the main contact with her on daily basis the benefits from that are endless.  The cost differance isnt huge but if you are on a tight budget I personally wouldnt stretch it further than you have to. so if your able bodied and ready for the commitment then I would suggest self board (its also great exercise)|`|7lsU5bcoaa	I'm really against no turnout board situations. I believe that it goes against the horse's nature. Imagine living in your bathroom. You get food brought to you, you can talk to your friends on the phone, but you're only allowed out an hour a day. It's not very happy :( . I had my horse on limited turnout for a while (she was in training for a month - the barn would turnout a couple hours a day) and I don't think she was very happy (she is normally on all-day turnout stalled at night). Plus at 3 yrs old a horse is still growing and developing muscles and she's not even broke yet so she's not even working. I wouldn't reccommend it sorry:(    good luck, it's so hard to find a good boarding barn.|`|QMl4ELhGaa	I would rather not see my horse as much and let him have regular turnout than have him closer and only get turned out about an hour a day. Horses that are kept in their stalls all day can develop habits such as cribbing, pawing, etc. Plus, most horses just are not happy like that, especially if they are used to being out. My friend's horse bowed his tendon. We took turns taking him out every day for at least an hour and letting him graze, but he quickly became pushy, grouchy and a pain in the butt because he was not happy. I would love to have my horse closer for my sake, but I drive 30 minutes to see him so that he can have daily turnout and excellent care. Yes, it would be wonderful to see him more but I do not think he would be as happy. Since you have probably decided to move him, I would try out the self care so you can be sure she gets adequate turnout. If that does not workout, you can always go for full board.|`|uNIHqmH8aa	My suggestion: Do the math. Are the prices of gas that you are spending now stretching your budget? What is the place she is now like? If the gas is cheaper than the extra $100, I would keep her where she is. Especially if she would only be turned out for 1 hour a day... Or you can take a chance and stretch your budget, but with this economy, I wouldn't suggest it.     Good Luck!  -Nov|`|shrdQ5guaa	There are people that do only exercise their horses instead of turnout, but its not really the norm. The kind of horses that only get excersized are really expensive hhigh classshow horses or thoroughbred, because their breeders/owners don't wwantto risk injury and decrease their horses' value. Its also very unhealthy to keep your horse cooped up in a stall all day except for when you ride it. It's bad for their imune system and their breathing. An alternative to your boarding situation would be to ask her if you could have "outdoor board" which is great for training greenies. Ask her if you could keep your horse in a paddock 24/7(one that has shelter available though) and then she would only take care of feeding, and there would be no stall to clean. Discuss with her the price, and be negotiable.    goodluck!

u3Hdoeiqaa	Don't worry - your guinea pigs are showing perfectly normal behaviour!    Even though they were living together before, they need to re-establish dominance now that they are in a new environment (especially since they did not move in at the same time).    Guinea pigs normal dominance behaviours can include squeeking and chattering, chasing, nose-butting, mounting etc. This is all normal and nothing to be concerned about, so just leave them to it and keep an eye on them. The ONLY time you need to separate them is if they have a proper fight and acutally draw blood.  Please do not separate unnecessarily - guinea pigs are a social species and need the company of their own kind. It would be far worse for them to be forced to live alone.    Obviously, you do need to make sure both pigs are getting access to food and water. Try spreading the veggies around the cage a bit, so the bully pig can't hog them all. You cuold also try adding another food bowl and water bottle if necessary.    But please don't worry - give them a couple of days to decide who's boss in their new home and they will settle down. Trust me - I have introduced a lot of pigs!    http://www.guineapigcages.com/  http://www.guinealynx.info/  http://www.cavyspirit.com/|`|gTXUcd1maa	I think their just playing.

3p6wp7DYaa	How can you tell she is chewing on forbidden objects in order to get your attention? You also say she does it when you're "in the middle of giving her attention." She chews on things not because she has an agenda, but because it is fun! It's like eating a bag of popcorn while watching TV for you and me.    She chews because all dogs chew. They need the exercise for the jaws, they love the feel in their teeth and gums, and it is feels like a job! She needs more stimulation in her daily life. You have to  give her things she CAN chew and make them more appealing than the other stuff. Get her kongs, bully sticks, bones, etc. Play with her at least 30 minutes a day. Petting is great, but she needs a "job" so teach her to play fetch, teach her basic commands, play tug of war, etc. Also, keep forbidden objects out of her reach, and NEVER chase her when she gets something you don't want her to chew. The more you chase, the better the game gets (for her) and you are actually reinforcing the behavior you don't like.    Good luck!|`|TpOVmqpHaa	It's completely normal for her to chew...dogs rarely outgrow this behavior before 2-3 years.    While she may be trying to get you to play/chase her for the forbidden objects, it's more likely she simply loves to do it.  Dogs and puppies should be treated like toddlers.....ie, do a little 'baby' proofing by putting away a lot of the things that you don't need all the time.  Keep a basket of toys she's allowed to play with, and whenever she grabs a prohibited item, say 'out', take it from her and take her over to the basket, grab a toy and begin to play. You need to read her cues, and tell her 'no', for even looking at the magazines, pillows, etc.  Done properly, she'll start to look to the alternative toys on her own.   HOWEVER, until she's older, she should never be relied upon to leave the forbidden items alone when you're not around.  The best single solution for this is confinement...put her in a crate or pen where she simply cannot get to anything she's not allowed to have.  Give her some save toys/chews to play with.  This will alleviate the mental and financial frustration, and you'll spend more time having fun with her than cleanining up after her.  Good luck, and don't forget...HAVE FUN!|`|9011c787ebf4ea3d0b73a7f282338f19aa	flick the dog in the ear every time you catch her chewing on something|`|XDRRg5o4aa	My dog does the same thing, the best thing to do is just not give the dog any attention for it. Tying her up or isolating the dog for a while helps and teaches the dog not to be an attention seeker. Hitting the dog is also okay, but not too hard just a sharp slap on the nose. Remember if you treat your dog like a human she will treat you like a dog.|`|B8Gwxo1laa	Young dogs chew on things when they're teething, bored, or seemingly in your case, when they are excited. Hopefully she will outgrow this, but in the meantime, just try taking the items away with a firm "NO!" Keep saying no --like kids, it's one of the first words most dogs understand.|`|kg4aOcKeaa	my pup did this    when dogs want attention they will find a way to get it, she knows that when she is doing something wrong she gets yelled at but it is still attention. you best bet is to dog proof the house. it will stink not having pillows on the couch but just try it for a bit. Now when she wants the attention and starts chewing on something, don't say anything to her just take it away and give her a toy. when she starts chewing on the toy get all excited and praise her to no end. This is will show her that she is not getting attention when she chews on the table but rather on her toys. She will start to see this and encourage it when she picks up her toys.    if she ges mouthy while playing its because she is so happy that she doesn't know what to do with herself and gets frustrated.(my dog does this when people first walk in the door because she wants to jump so badly but knows she can't) once again, have a toy handy and give it to her over the other object, walk away and when she picks up the toy go back to playing.     the idea is to ignore her as much as possible, no voice, eye contact or reaction just take the magazine away give her a toy and go about your business. be consistent and it will work.    also your dog is getting to the age where is has more constant energy, so another walk(30 mins at night) to settle her might help some.|`|w0p8zwt7aa	Had a problem like this with our current dog, it's 9 months old.    I have a squirt bottle,  fill it with water.  When it chews on something I don't want it to, I squirt the dog.  I can not stress the timing. It has to be chewing "NOW".  Not 2 mintues ago or else it will forget why it was hit with a small spray of water    Stopped chewing on my couch in just a couple days.    Also it will probably stop around 1 1/2 - 2 years.  It's still in puppy mode and all puppies chew.|`|290865c4a828675d5b0c1f19390e40b0aa	One way to stop a negative behavior is with positive reinforcement.    The question becomes: How can I positively reinforce the dog to use her mouth when I ask her to?    The answer lies in using her own nature against her.    Let me explain.    Dogs have a natural prey drive.  They have a natural propensity to chew.  Combine the two into one product and one command, and voila!  You've solved the problem.    Now the questions become: What command do I give?  What do I have my dog chew on command?    I recommend something like Antlerz dog chews :     http://www.asankadogs.com/Antlerz.html    http://www.petfooddirect.com/store/shop_...    The Antlerz will automatically be picked up in the mouth by a dog.  Alternate with your usual treats and smelly man socks if your dog likes to pick them up.  I don't get the dog's love for mens smelly socks, but heh, I used whatever worked.    One command you can use is "pick up".  This will train your dog to pick up objects on command.  Work 5 minutes a day, saying "pick up" and placing the Antlerz dog chew in your dog's mouth.  Throw treats and say "pick up".  Throw out the nasty man sock and say "pick up".  Praise dog for picking up.    It's no fun for the dog to bother you by chewing things when it becomes not only a command, but she loves chewing on her deer antler.  Your problem, if given 5 minutes a day, should be resolved within a week.

You'll wind up with way to many cats if you dont, which cost even more money than just neutering the one.
DXzI2jrEaa	I don't know if anyone can give you a definite answer on this one, but my experience is that a kitten's personality sometimes changes depending on the environment.  Your kitten has learned over time that she is in a  consistently safe and loving environment, and that she can count on you for her needs.  I think some kittens (or cats), semi-feral or not, take longer than others to absorb and respond to this but do learn and change with time.    My eight-month-old kitten has lived with me since she was twelve-weeks-old. She was born to a rescued feral mother.  She was always  shy and skittish, and I just accepted her as she was.  I just took very good care of her and played with her all the time.  All of a sudden, out of the blue, two weeks ago, she decided to become a lap cat.  I never expected this and am still surprised by the dramatic change in her personality.  She runs to me to be petted and jumps on my lap every day.   I can only guess that it just took her a long time to understand that she is safe and loved.|`|Run7dyraaa	I don't know, but that's great! That is what you would want, right?

Just some guppies and Zebra danios will be OK.    Ian|`|bDPVRtCNaa	No.     1.Not even a single goldfish can thrive in a ten gallon tank. Goldfish are massive waste producers and will quickly pollute ten gallons. A single fancy goldfish requires 20 gallons and will grow 6-8 inches. A single common goldfish requires 55 gallons and will grow at least one foot long. They would also destroy your plants.    2. Goldfish are coldwater fish. They prefer oxygen rich cool water. Guppies and danios are tropical fish and require a heater.    ~A ten gallon tank will comfortably hold the guppies. The zebra danios are high energy fish and usually only recommended for tanks with more swimming space.|`|fxH6T7vCaa	no. goldfish give of a sertin type of chemical that will harm or usually kill other fish. Goldfish only go with goldfish.|`|9YCrqlMiaa	If you want a goldfish, that would occupy the 10G already. Plus, Zebra Danios and feeder guppies have different temperature requirements than goldfish do. I would just do feeeder guppies and Zebra Danios if I were you. I think that would look much better than having a big goldfish in the tank, plus not as much waste in the tank.|`|Dp1CZiJ4aa	No goldfish.|`|ThAhxR7waa	Mmmm. Well, the goldfish aren't tropical, and thus kind of clash requirement-wise with the Danio and Guppies. Not to mention most require atleast a 30+ gallon at **minimum**.    I personally would never buy 'feeder' anything, even if I had a carnivorous fish. They can be so unhealthy, they not only make bad pets, but even bad food.    Anywho, the tropical fish would (seeing as they are generally pretty small) probably be great for a 10 gallon.   The only other issue I would warn about is that Danio may or may not pick up fin-nipping. Considering males Guppies have those beautiful little fan tails, that could potentially turn into a very big problem for you.     I'd personally recommend you toss the Goldfish and Danio idea and maybe head with some nice Tetra instead (like Cardinal, Head & Tail Light, etc).   And on the 'feeder' issue ... Normal guppies would be a much smarter investment.

If the dog smells bad, try the following:    A bath (just try this once, bathing too frequently is bad for the coat)    Check the ears (ear infections can make the ears very smelly)    Take him to a groomer or vet to have his anal glands expressed, they may be plugged    If the dog has smelly gas, your best bet is to change to a higher quality food.  Look for a dog food with a meat as the first ingredient, no by-products (meal such as chicken meal is okay), and no grains (corn, rice, wheat, etc.) in the first 5 ingredients.  Dogs don't digest grains well, and it leads to gas.  A higher quality food will cut down on the amount of gas, and will lead to less poop in the yard because more of the food is digested and used by the body.    Hope this helps!|`|rkJv14yaaa	give him a bath|`|DmUG33axaa	dogs have glands in there "butt" that release when they use the bathroom, sometimes they get clogged and smell really really bad, our great dane had that it was terrible. if you take them to the vet or a groomer they will squeeze them (discusting i know) but if you are lucky they might teach you how to do it.. lol.|`|vQ9U7bvwaa	when you say smells bad, do you mean he farts a lot ? (i get this from the gad pill things) or do you mean he just smells in general ?    because if he smells in general, a bath with dog shampoo would probably be the best thing.|`|pGIOz14Faa	Take the dog to a vet or groomer and have his anal glands expressed.|`|izWi8hfjaa	Get rid of the dog, you really shouldnt or dont need a smelly dog running around.|`|PMksnqkxaa	Do you brush his teeth? Do you clean inbetween his wrinkles? If so he may have an ear infection or he may need his anal glands expressed. If you mean his gas smells really bas maybe switch to a better quality food.|`|7HxJvbjMaa	Some people say to mix canned green beans into the food for gassy dogs. Make sure you rinse them though because of the salt.  Also, what are you feeding him? If you buy his food at a grocery store it is not top quality. Gassy dogs need a corn & wheat free food.|`|9011c787ebf4ea3d0b73a7f282338f19aa	all puppies are like that; but if you take him/her a bath every 3 days you will forget that he/she even smells !!|`|tPGxPDvBaa	If it is gas, adding a teaspoon daily of plain yogurt will help some. You might need to change  dog food.  It might be anal glands if it is a strong fishy rotten smell that is very strong sometimes but not often or if you see him licking there or scooting. Go to vet or groomer for glands.|`|aXYiOskmaa	his body smells or his gas smells?  all gas smells. that's nature.  if it's his body, give him a bath and check his ears. and brush his teeth too
giWvSwqRaa	Room temperature of 75F is OK.|`|bDPVRtCNaa	What do you mean by 80%? Do you mean 80 degrees? If the thermometer reads 80F, than coldwater fish are not an option.    Type of fish depends on tank size. I can't recommend any fish until I know that they are compatible with the tank. What size tank do you have?|`|9759e8014743debd3d3fd1a7ad437c1faa	In most cases, the water level should be close to the top of the tank.    80 degrees shouldn't feel overly cool (though it's not as warm as, say, a hot bath). Are you checking the temperature with a thermometer, or just going by the setting on the heater? Use an accurate thermometer to test the temperature. Heaters are often calibrated inaccurately.    The temperature you should maintain in the tank depends entirely upon what kind of fish you will keep. Trout, for example, do well between 50 and 60 degrees F (they also need a very big tank, but that's another subject). Discus fish like their water temperature around 85 F. And so on.|`|fxH6T7vCaa	How about plain old goldfish, they are easy to take care of, and are cold watered. What do you mean by 80%.|`|45Cbtd7raa	i don't recommend gold fish because they pollute but a tropical fish is a African cichlid but watch out there aggressive ur tempeture should be 76 to 82 farenheit i recommend 78 to 80 good luck|`|PlBHhU3Kaa	well 80 degrees feels cool but it is actually 80 degrees|`|LNuvndivaa	explain better|`|pM4YogW5aa	All of the factors depend on the type of fish you plan to stock.  Generally, this is around 75 degrees, but some fish, like clown loaches, like it much warmer.    I normally keep my water level to the top trim, but make sure the tank has a hood.    Here's a pretty solid list of fish|`|9YCrqlMiaa	I'll assume that you mean 80F, Temp wise. If your keeping coldwater fish, the temp should be lower than 75F and if your keeping tropical, you should keep it around 75F-82F.     Some of the coldwater fish are Goldfish, White Clouds and Red Shiners. There are tons more that you can find. Just search them.     Tropical fish range from Tetras, Rainbowfish and some other fish. If you  were to set-up a tropical tank, you will need to have a heater. Also have a filter in either set-up.     The water should be fine if you left it right below the rim. I like the look of a full tank so go for that if you want it. Good luck!|`|Iw6vqJd8aa	It is a good temp for tropical to sub-tropical fish. It is to hot for cold water fish. It is best to put the thermometer on the opposite side of the heater. That way it gives a more accurate temp.of the water.  I always filled my tanks just below the plastic piece that went around the top of the tank. I have found a couple of good websites that have good basic beginner sections.    http://www.fishlore.com/    http://www.aquaticcommunity.com/    They both have good fish listings that explain the hardiness of the fish, if the fish is a good beginner fish, size, feeding, and all that neat stuff.|`|Dp1CZiJ4aa	I think your talking about 80 degrees. If that is so then your fine for any tropical warm water fish. Cold water fish could not survive in those temperature conditions. If you are not talking about that then some cold water fish are, goldfish, Bloodfin Tetra, Buenos Aires Tetra, Croaking Tetra, and Zebra Danio, just to name a few. Most people think of goldfish of being cold water fish but there are actually quite many. Good luck with your new tank!
Um8osMNuaa	Your dog should be fine. Dogs need to ingest a large amount of chocolate for it to cause any damage.  The reason chocolate is harmful is because it contains Theobromine, it is toxic to dogs.  lt can cause hyperactivity, kidney damage, increased or irregular heart beat, muscle tremors, vomiting and diarrhoea.  They may pass large amounts of urine and be excessively thirsty.  Your dog only ate a small amount of milk chocolate so she should be fine, it's dark and bakers chocolate that is the most toxic, these contain higher amounts of Theobromine, although she may have a little diarrhoea, if she shows any of the signs, or you are at all worried then you should give your vets a ring and ask for advise.|`|bxlYleZkaa	She will be a bit browned off for a while.|`|m4uDn0ofaa	You should monitor her and call your vet to let them know. If you watch her she should be fine.|`|9011c787ebf4ea3d0b73a7f282338f19aa	yes, but its depends on how many times you give her chocolate cause a dog can pass away if given to much chocolate ...but if its like once or twice then your fine|`|1TsTB6cvaa	depends on the size of it. small one should be fine really, just make sure she doesnt eat any more chocolate|`|1NWjta2jaa	Many people think that chocolate is deadly for dogs. Well, it's defiantly not good for them and A LOT of it can kill the dog, but one bar will not harm your dogs. Did you say dogS? More than one dog ate one bar? Unless your dogs are tiny puppies, I wouldn't worry about it.|`|72GOhb9eaa	It depends on the size of the bar and the dog.|`|b418f2cdb879b4a8266bb262f2fee70daa	Keep a close watch - chocolate is poisonous to dogs - but Galaxy contains so little actual chocolate that it should hopefully just pass straight though (at a rapid rate probably)|`|Cx9c6KrVaa	Yes - that's crap chocolate with only a tiny cocoa solids content. If she had eaten some of that 80% cocoa solids stuff, she could be in serious trouble.|`|6RqjxUTnaa	She will be Fine Just a slight belly ace and some Runs LOL thats about all it just increased her chances of getting Cancer! Hope This Helps|`|DJLeObm4aa	You don't say what size of a bar it was.  Even if it was on the large side your dog should be fine although she may have the 'runs' if she isn't used to it or if she made a glutton of herself be sick.  I have never overfed my dogs but before we were ever told about chocolate being dangerours to dogs my dogs often had the odd piece of chocolate and the present one still does although only a little bit occassionally. This one bar should not do any harm but I am sure your concern for her this time will ensure you never again leave chocolate where she can get it again. Probably a lesson to you both, you to be careful and her to remember any effects......though IF there was a next time I am sure she would just do it again. That's dogs for you !!!|`|apUkTo3maa	WATCH FOR ANY HARMFUL SIGNS.|`|tP4Bx4OWaa	A single, shop purchased bar of chocolate is not going to kill your dog. It's unlikely it would even harm the dog in any great deal so let's not get too anxious.      Your dog has to ingest quite a bit of chocolate to feel any negative effects. It is the caffeine and theobromine in chocolate that is poisonous to your dog. Dark  chocolate is most toxic to your dog since it contains a high amount of caffeine and theobromine. Milk chocolate and white chocolate have lower amounts of caffeine.|`|ad9efc98eb0fbeeae6b6c4abfd63046caa	no take it to the vet|`|ZddQ0XHmaa	if it's milk chocolate she will get diarrhea or vomit. Baker's chocolate is more dangerous.      i'd honestly be more concerned with the wrapper not being able to be passed.|`|wogjc0Adaa	Probably - might have a stomach upset for a little while but I doubt that one bar of Galaxy will be harmful enough to do real damage|`|meLGAZLcaa	Did he feel the bubbles melt?|`|dSGwrfinaa	Chocolate is not really suposed to be fed to animals as it swells up in their stomach or something like that. what id do is keep an eye on her. chances are shel be sick or something but if she startd not to eat or is very lazy, take her to the vets. it would hurt to phone up in the morning and just enquire with them.|`|hB1SkPqRaa	That all depends on how much and what kind of chocolate( dark or milk) in calculation to her weight. You should probably give her a few teaspoons of hydrogen peroxide to make her vomit. Then call a emergency vet clinic or animal poison control center.|`|foAhWTymaa	it depends how much chocolate. if its not that much then just make sure she stays hydrated and she'll be fine. if she ate a ton of chocolate than you might want to call the vet asap!|`|oJqWmHlqaa	if you google it you can get the exact amounts of chocolate that will harm your dog.  I know that the cocoa content matters.|`|yLn54k8qaa	My dog has done it many times :(    he is a little bugger when there is chocolate about|`|l016CyAcaa	Yeah just be careful next time|`|L0j9urloaa	She'll probably be all right. I doubt one bar would do her any real damage. Once, my dog got into a pack of Chocolate Chip Cookies; I don't know how many there were left, but once she was done with them, it was empty. She was and is completely fine!|`|qFcRhWw0aa	Yeah she'll be fine.  Since it is milk chocolate it isn't as dangerous as something like dark chocolate.  Dark chocolate is the most dangerous for a dog. My mum was stupid enough to give the dog a really rich dark truffle and my dog went into this kind of fit :S She was okay in the end though. Thank god.|`|S7VJ1GDdaa	Depending on the weight of the dog and what type of chocolate,they should be OK if it wasn't the pure chocolate ( bakers chocolate). If it was white chocolate then it will be completely fine because dogs can have white chocolate. Get prepared for the sick tummy.|`|15b48876ffd5505969947c3bfe59eb00aa	all will be fine. a little loose stools for a day or so. Relax, and keep things put up away from your pet.|`|3p6Nm8AXaa	your dog will be fine but i have a fell terrier and he used to grab my shirt , he would never let go untill he was given a small bag of milky bar buttons, this went on almost every night , he began to know that if he grabbed my shirt he would get a bag of buttons just so he would let go, i am sorry to say this has led to diabetes and the result is he is now totally blind and needs constant care, so please keep ALL chocolate away from your dog.|`|0J1cYbXQaa	Phone the vet chocolate is toxic to dogs     http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-...    The above link gives a clear explanation|`|6eaa0b61f602657500c8e4340d6b6bfeaa	You need to know the weight of your dog...then work out the cocoa solids in the chocolat, and how much was consumed.    Then look on the internet there are guides as to per kilo of dog weigth per gram of cocoa that the dog can handle....if your dog ate a lot for it's size take it straight to a vet.  The liver can't process the chemicals in the chocolate it can poison and kill your dog, but it depends on the size of your dog and the amount eaten.|`|Dr83qIEYaa	yeah :D

But research the pros and cons before you make your decision.|`|9011c787ebf4ea3d0b73a7f282338f19aa	its normal; you should probably breed her but thats up to you...she will be fine though|`|JVvnET59aa	She's crying because she wants to get outside and do what is natural.

7ZsMMkp5aa	Thankfully, no. just make sure that you don't leave too many crickets in the tank, they will attack the lizard. Also I wouldn't give them meal worms if the geckos are very small, if not killed when eating, they could eat the insides of your gecko, but it seems like yours is big enough to crunch them in their mouth. If your gecko is housed in a tank bigger than 10 gallons(which I have), they might not be able to catch the crickets, that doesn't meen that they have to be put in a smaller tank, just put the leo and the crickets in something like what you keep your crickets in, not the same thing, but something like it. One last thing, make sure that the crickets are no bigger than the space between your leo's eyes. Good luck!       *__*|`|xoXkHOVsaa	The gecko will eat as much as it needs to.  If crickets are left over in the cage, then you need to remove them.  The crickets can stress out your gecko and bite him while he sleeps.|`|nooi0ldjaa	throw in 3-5 crickets every time you look in and see none, if you look in and still see some, then wait. your leo well eat when he/she needs to. so not really with crickets, but you can over feed with wax or meal worms...its like candy to them so they'll eat till they burst. your better off staying away from wax worms for ever.|`|0Is8sJj0aa	leos generally eat as much as they need they are pigs like some other reptiles.

vZFLG75Zaa	First of all, do not shoot near it.  That is incredibly stupid to do... I used to work at a raptor rehab center and we got SO many hawks, falcons, eagles, and owls with gunshot wounds ranging from shotguns and BB guns.  I would suggest calling your state's game and fish dept.  Or they can give you the number of your nearest wildlife organization that can capture it and relocate the hawk.  But till then, stay outside when taking your dogs out to the bathroom.  As long as you are near, they won't hunt.  But whatever you do, dont shoot at it.|`|SMFhXxcfaa	theres really nothing  you can do besides never leaving your dogs unattended outside.  Try calling the local DNR and ask them your question.  they may be able to help you more.|`|6KxBqnstaa	Nothing you can really do about it. If you have small dogs do not let them out unattended. You can give the DEC a call and they may be able to give you some suggestions. It is against the law to hurt or kill them not saying you ever would but it is punishable by fine and jail time as they are protected. Some wildlife rehabbers may be able to give some advice also and may tell how the hawk can be relocated but they usually come back. They are attracted to the movement of live prey. You could try putting a large motion detector owl up in the yard that's about all I can think of. Good luck.|`|aqY13vWNaa	Call animal control, thats the best I can think of.|`|IQ6BfyvAaa	Get a paintball gun or a bebe gun however you spell it and anytime that hawk goes in your backyard shoot next to it. Only enough to scare it off. Thats what I do with all these stupid cats in my neighborhood. But have good aim because you dont want to hit it and kill it.|`|Oii9H4g6aa	oh my gosh, i am so so sorry for your loss!!i really am, thats very sad, but i think the best thing to do is call animal control so they can send it to some animal shelter for wild birds and the people will probably check it to see if it has no injuries and then release it into the forest or somewhere not close to a neighborhood, hope i helped, again i am so so sorry!!|`|945ba19d111dc5da6f3f75a5979a26a0aa	get a big dog to chase the hawk
TJBFBRZuaa	That low stuttery sound you hear Oink making is called chattering, and it is just a way of declaring dominance. Climbing onto your new pig's back just confirms that he is pretty much stating that he is the boss. As long as he does not fight and bite and draw blood, the two can remain in the same cage. Stewart is a very young pig, so he is more likely to popcorn around. About the water... some pigs just drink more than others, similar to my pigs; it seems Tilly never drinks at all, but Willow will never leave it! That is why it is not recommended to put their vitamins in their water. That may be the cause of all the urine, but I would consult with your vet if it continues to be a worry to you.   Aside from all that, they seem like a healthy, normal pair of guineas. Enjoy them!|`|LNnRSLdtaa	yeah this is normal guinea pig behaviour  they are just establishing dominance    in every pig pairing there will be a dominant pig. every now and then the submisive pig will try to take over and they will aruge it out in a number of ways    1) the 'hormonal attack' as you called it. the one who climbs onto the others back is stating that they are the boss.   2) 2 males is not the best thing, they will argue over dominace ALOT more than females do, but aslong as it doesnt get aggressive (fur ball fights) its fine  3) the rumble strut. one of your pigs will like move there hips around and make the stuttery noise (teeth chatter)    popcorning is a good thing. means they are happy/excited.     and the thirst isnt a problem, maybe check that the bottle works
giWvSwqRaa	Big belly.|`|KEYgd73saa	I can assure you, it's not pregnant.  Axolotls lay eggs, making it impossible for it to become pregnant.  It's much more likely that it simply over ate during the last meal, and the "eggs" you're seeing are either clear waste (common when they're constipated) or snail eggs.|`|UEyIL8kuaa	Axolotl eggs look like small round pin-head sized balls.    If your female Axolotl is an albino, or light colored, like a golden albino or lecuistic,  the eggs will has white balls in the middle.  If your axolotl is dark colored, like a wild type of black axolotl, it will have dark colored eggs.     Also, Axolotls lay many many eggs at a time, around 100 at least.     If there is something white or cottony looking around her gills, it might be a type of fungus.    Also, How old are your axolotls? They should not breed until 18 months, or until they stop growing, but some will breed closer to a year old. This is potentionally dangerous for your female axolotls health.
fxH6T7vCaa	The mating process of sunset fish is an interesting one that many researchers find intriguing. The male courts the female, brushing his fins softly across her sides, coaxing and soothing her before she begins to brush her fins against him in return. Females generally respond to the brightly coloured male in their area, and it is possible for that male to mate several times. After the female accepts the males overtures, the two will briefly mate, pressing their belly vents together, and part again. Unlike most fish, fertilization takes place internally, thus ensuring a particular males colouration will be passed on to all his offspring. Sunset Fish typically only mate once per year, and thus after mating will leave the mating ground, though the females will stay a little longer to lay their yellowish eggs. These eggs are only a few grains in diameter and are rather adhesive, sticking to rocks and pieces of water plants. Realy hoped this helped!|`|lCaVsjESaa	yeah usually they hide cause i have guppies and they breed like crazy. They have like black circles sometimes that you can see at the end of their stomachs near the tail.

It would look like it is panting. Take the heat rock out right away. They are known to seriously injure lizards. Unless you have a strong heat pad and thin substrate, it's the heat rock. Instead of having a heat rock, have a nice flat slate with a heat lamp over it. If it is a heat pad, still keep the heat rock out, just get a heat pad that isn't as strong.

My Email:  dragonfirebreeding@yahoo.com|`|9qE58vNSaa	Are you sure it is dieing? I didn't know bearded dragons could burn. Umm they do live in the desert...(kinda)
7ZsMMkp5aa	I suggest that you try feeding it for 5-10 minutes until it stops eating because it will only overfeed if you leave the food in its tank. Also it might have to do with the environment. For example, too small of a tank, temperature, a heat rock. I can't suggest anything else unless it is wild type, but I didn't think that people actually get those. But if it is wild, it would only be doing this now because its in-stinks are kicking in. If this keeps happening, you should go see a VERY reliable reptile expert. If it is someone from a petstore(not specificly a reptile store) they might say that it is something it is not and make you spend money on something that is not true. Good luck!    *__*|`|xoXkHOVsaa	Is the habitat clean?  Is it at the right temperature?  That could be part of it.

fxH6T7vCaa	First you can tell if she is pregant because she will have a gravid/dark spot under her belly. And if she is, then you should buy a birthing box or net(that you can usually buy at petsmart or somthing). Make sure that she isn't under stress while close to birth because she could have babys earlier or something and they will die. Other guppies(including their parents) will eat them, so I sudgest keping them in there net or etc. intill 3-4 weeks old, or till biger then any fish in the community/main tank. they eat grounded flakes, and are born already knowing how to swim and etc., thats why they are called fry. The mom could have from 20-60 babys usually and cand hold the sperms and does not have to give birth all at ounce. she also will need time to recover after birth and will get stressed if in the birthing box or net to long.9you can tell when she gives birth because her spot will be squared off and will probebly not eat for a whie). they will probebly give birth at about 4 weeks after being pregant, but it can range up to 60 days!!! Also the tem. of water should be about 78 deg.s and don't feed them too much or somthing because the extra food acn polute the tank and kill them. Also the babys/frys colors should come in about the same time the can mate(3 weeks). The fish should all be pretty neet to look at when they gt their colors in too. If those are too many for you to handel then your lokel pet store should take them off your hands. Hoped I helped Lots!!!=)|`|0b8c6deec73968ee5de1b69c2345788caa	Your best bet if you don't want babies eaten put her in a divider or separate tank|`|9YCrqlMiaa	I don't mean to be rude or anything, but Goldfish are coldwater. They will survive in tropical temperature, but not for long. Also, goldfish produce too much waste to be in a tropical set-up.What do you mean the normal kind? You mean the long fan tail ones? When your Goldfish might end up eating your guppies and the fry. The snails might add up some waste.     Yo, pregnant guppies are pretty easy to care for. Most of the fry will survive unless they get hunted down by other fish. The gestation period for guppies is about a month. So, every month, you'll expect to have some fry. Generally, try not to stress the fish out so you won't have trouble.     Good luck! If you have any questions, e-mail me or check out  www.fishlesscycling.com/forum
7HxJvbjMaa	It sounds like ich to me. That's what fish do when they have ich. Are you sure he doesn't have tiny white spots like salt on his body or fins? Sometimes you need a magnifying glass to see it. They sell ich remedies at pet stores.  Do you have a sick tank you can move him to so the other fish aren't compromised?  Another possibility, did you do a water change recently? Some fish are sensitive to new water.
iz03uvV4aa	Hunter Green is the best, otherwise I think Navy looks quite nice on chestnuts too!!! :)  And if he is man enough, pink :P hahaha<br>  <br>  EDIT**<br>  LOL - Couldnt help but mention it!!!!! :)|`|jyGTlpzTaa	I think yellow, red and purple look great on bright chestnuts, and white, green and yellow on livers.|`|qI6oPzA0aa	i think that they look really good in dark or light blue and dark green and also leather or a lil *bling bling* never fails too:o)<br>  good luck|`|XL62syrCaa	Turquoise purple and black. those tend to look best (and not too girly for a boy either!)|`|gXfbnaF1aa	i have a chestnut to and i have the colors neon yellow,purple(dark) and neon green and sometimes i even put him in neon orange he looks soo good oh and sometimes i might put him in pink hes gay neways lol|`|XB0UpJsLaa	Hunter green, lime green, mint green, lilcac, purple, teal, sky blue.

wrUsMG4Jaa	Dogs don't "get better" if they have diabetes.    They should be put on a daily regimen of insulin along with a special diet to prevent a problematic crash.    Here is a website dedicated to helping diabetic dog owners understand their dogs condition:  http://www.caninediabetes.org/|`|bWFg35qyaa	go to the vet and hope u the best luck|`|P8Q39vA4aa	Talk to  you vet about insulin and a special diet.|`|tPGxPDvBaa	Sit down & calmly discuss it with your parents.  Diabetes in dogs isn't hard to manage but with his age it will be more difficult.  There is no cure for diabetes or old age so his time will come & you will have to prepare yourself.|`|lTsDwY9Paa	Ask your parents. Don't get over emotional whatever they tell you. A diabetic dog needs to be on special food and insulin. Don't give him any treats and give him lots of love.
wrUsMG4Jaa	Most rawhides are treated with nasty chemicals- like formaldehyde! ICK!    Bully Sticks last just as long as the hides (if not longer) and my pets prefer them to rawhides.     http://www.bestbullysticks.com/|`|9H90ud06aa	raw hides can be dangerous to dogs because they can splinter.. causing it to become lodged in parts of the digestive tract. my vet suggested that i buy my dog a cows knee bone. it's literally a cows knee.. it's kind of gross when you think about it.. but my dog loves them. and it's important to have them chewing on bones to keep them healthy (i don't remember why it was he said this was healthy)|`|fgxajTiBaa	I used to let my dog chew on them because the only issue I had heard was they choke on them. So as long as they watched him carefully then he should be fine. THEN I read something about how sometimes they can carry bacteria that can make them really sick, and that even though they don't choke on them, they never fully digest and can often over time cause a blockage. That was the end of rawhides.  Some things I have found/heard that work well for big chewers are these bones they sell at pet stores that are filled with Peanut Butter or Salmon paste. My dog LOVES them and will suck out the filling (which takes a good week to get all out) and then he still continues to chew on the bone even after everything is gone.  Another thing which I have heard good things about is the Everlasting Treat http://www.petfooddirect.com/store/produ...  They are kind of expensive but I've heard dogs go crazy on them. Definitely try those!! :)|`|MvX2Hg9Taa	What kind of dog, large breed dogs shouldn't have raw hide and its still not that good for dogs. There not supoose to have it longer then 15 mins because of the calories. But you can get cow cheeks or cow ears and it's a lot better for them and its doesn't cost to much!!

G0KKfXMUaa	To everyone who answered above- He has NOT been ridden in over a week. It's not from being ridden too hard!<br>  <br>  Anyways...<br>  <br>  Well if there's no external cuts, missing patches of hair, etc. Then I doubt this is from rough play in the fields.<br>  <br>  Was he running hard and bucking for a long period of time in the field at all? That could be it.<br>  <br>  Is he acting normal? Can you feel his pulse? Is it normal? And is his temperature normal? Also see if he's more tired than usual, or more irritable than usual.<br>  <br>  If he's acting perfectly fine, chances are he'll be okay.<br>  <br>  But it's always best to have the vet come take a look.<br>  <br>  In the meanwhile, I would keep him in a stall with clean air and fresh water. Keep his face clean, and wipe his muzzle when need be.|`|GmaDTTEJaa	We have a horse at our stables the gets bloody noses when he breaths in to much dust. The vest says it's normal for him and it's fine.<br>  <br>  I've also seen nose bleeds from horses getting kicked in the face.<br>  <br>  It might be nothing but you never know. It's good that you called a vet because the only real way to know is to have a professional look at him.|`|FxrV0QS4aa	I completely agree with Giggs.<br>  <br>  It makes sense. And still get him checked just in case. As far as right now with your horse, just keep him in a stall.|`|2x2LYkj4aa	i agree he was prob. worked really hard, or he could have smacked something against it in the paddock or by another horse.... he could have been snorting LOL!!!|`|B6zl0AJDaa	If you don't think he got kicked or someother way injured, then the last time I saw a horse with a bloody nose was one that was trying to pass a stone.  Is he acting a little colicky?|`|5JNhV6Ovaa	Im a realist so I am going to throw this out here because it happened to a friend of mine and her horse. <br>  <br>  22 year old AMAZINGLY BEAUTIFUL bay gelding, (Buddy). Started getting bloody nose and she had some tests done. Buddy ended up have a tumor in his naval cavity. And when for instance, dust, or hitting it or breathing really hard, he would always end up with bloody nose. <br>  <br>  Now depending if that's the case then on however long it has been there they could possibly remove it. But I am not a vet I speaking from my friends experience. <br>  <br>  Good luck, best wishes.|`|AA12048299	Sara;<br>  <br>  Have your vet see if he can't scope the horse. If the drainage is consistent, I'm a bit worried for you. I suspect gutteral pouch infection:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm/bc/121329.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index....</a><br>  <br>  I won't frighten you with the details, but suffice to say it's a fungal infection that lays up against the carotid artery. If it's severe enough to break through, well, There's not much time. <br>  <br>  It *can* be treated with surgery though, and on occasion, daily treatment with topical application of formalyn. Please ask your vet specifically about this condition; you may not have much time.<br>  <br>  Best of luck.|`|2e3212eaa1705a76512ead9dd4fb9aadaa	did you work him to hard? thats probably why|`|iz03uvV4aa	Out of curiosity - was your horse worked hard or playing hard in the paddock just before you noticed this? Perhaps he was running around out there?<br>  <br>  I ask this because I am curious to know if this is a case of EIPH (Exercise-Induced Pulmonary Hemorrhage )? I am very familiar with TBs off track and this is VERY common in them.  Usually its nothing overly serious but it CAN lead to more serious issues and in the odd case cause perminent damage and issues. Instead of me trying to explain it I copied a blurb for you to read--><br>  <br>  "EIPH is characterized by bleeding from the lungs after strenuous exercise. According to an article in the UC Davis Center for Equine Health's The Horse Report, recent studies suggest that anywhere from 70 to 100 percent of horses in racing and training experience EIPH. It is believed horses experience EIPH because during exercise they have unusually high blood pressures in the vessels that lead from the heart to the lungs and this high pressure causes the walls of the vessels to break and release blood into the airways."<br>  From - www.toba.org<br>  Here is the direct link to the article - lots of useful info:<br>  <a href="http://www.toba.org/owner-education/common-injuries-and-ailments.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.toba.org/owner-education/comm...</a><br>  <br>  If its not this then I am unsure - but Iam glad you have a vet comming out !!!!  Probably the best route anyways.<br>  <br>  Good Luck to you and your boy !!!!!! <3<br>  <br>  EDIT**<br>  Hard Work or Hard Play was a suggestion made BEFORE she posted the additional information Giggs.  We know this now but didnt before we had a chance to answer the question.  <br>  <br>  Either way - Giggs is right about keeping him inside.  Probably best to keep him in a clean air environment and keeping the nose as clean as you can for now until the vet gets there.<br>  <br>  Again, good luck :)
dB3Gu0Ypaa	she dos not like her food i feed my pregnant guppies live food try live brineshirmp that will do good i hope good luck with the batch|`|aeUjAvTuaa	First-i don't know if your watching your guppy 24/7. not to be mean but if your not doing that your fish is probably eating. for right know you shouldn't worry to much unless your fish is floating around or if other fish are biting the fishes tail

LAXxaxAZaa	If you're talking about the conditioner made by Shapley's, I don't like it. It's very oily, and doesn't work very well. I'd choose Mane and Tail or Cowboy Magic a million times over.    If you mean MTG, yesyesyes! It works wonderfully.      Sorry, it's just kind of confusing because you said MTG and conditioner... the conditioner isn't called MTG.|`|6DCQsdyuaa	well, it sort of does. You have to use a lot of it and use it very frequently to get good results. I suggest buying absorbine super poo. It conditions the horses coat really well and makes it ridicilously soft!|`|UeaZY4BTaa	I've never seen it work any better than the cheaper knock-offs. Personally, I stick with the mane-n'-tail shapmoo and conditioner line since its a bit more reasonable and works just fine to detangle and clean/polish up their coats.|`|xKHeYmQJaa	Yes, but rinse it out very well.|`|BM4zJ2vZaa	It works pretty good its very oily but it really makes the hair look healthy and keeps it that way. It is not good at detangling though cowboy magic is a great detangler.

There's not much seasonal difference in day lengths in the tropics, so about 12 hours on and 12 hours off (give or take a couple of hours) is a good schedule for tropical fish.|`|45Cbtd7raa	light off|`|0b8c6deec73968ee5de1b69c2345788caa	turn off at night|`|qAwnAYGAaa	Turn off the light because the dark simulates night an it makes the tank more "natural"  I turn mine off at night because it's in my bedroom and it helps me sleep better too|`|wLbXsvAKaa	Fish are just like people.

SO turn the light off at night|`|8ZL2mLDeaa	day time = on....night time = off|`|Hxa0lXb3aa	off they need to sleep which is impossible in the light. also if you leave your tank light to long algae will grow turning into a big prob and probably gets on your nerves     best wishes~|`|Oyb49z7Waa	Make your tank as natural as possible. Give it periods of daylight (light on) and night (light off). Your fish will appreciate the more natural times of darkness when they can rest.|`|RUEr2Jn9aa	You turn it off. Fish also sleep, and like people they sleep better when its dark. Like the above, in nature it gets dark at night, so leaving the light on would be disturbing your fish's natural habitat|`|CDVWnF7Laa	I use my fishtank light just like daylight. When I wake up in the morning, I turn it on and around sunset I turn it off. I think it helps to regulate time for the fish and stuff and they know when it is time to eat.
RUEr2Jn9aa	Fish tend to sleep when its dark because they are stimulated by the contrast in light. While sleeping, they will tend remain motionless(maybe 1 or 2 jerks) but will still have their eyes open. (they don't have eyelids) Fish are natural prey, so they tend to be found sleeping behind a rock, in plants, or in the corner of the tank.|`|CDVWnF7Laa	I fyou have a rock or anything in your tank you can sometimes catch them resting on it.|`|9H90ud06aa	they just look like they're swimming.. but in one place. and they might sort of drift towards the filter then "swim" rapidly away. this is an automatic function to keep them from being sucked in.|`|aeUjAvTuaa	Okay first-you don't sound like a idiot. Second-fish do sleep but it's not really sleeping. It's more like resting. When the lights are off the fish will float to the bottom of the fish tank and rest.|`|fxH6T7vCaa	At night (when you should turn out the tanks lights) is where the kind of relax (like sleep) so make sure that you lights are all out befor you go to bed.|`|0b8c6deec73968ee5de1b69c2345788caa	They sleep in a water bed lol|`|0vg85K6Xaa	They sleep while they swim, they just swim like regular, and it just looks like a fish swimming.|`|LtxNbyGQaa	they do they will normally lye ine one coner of the tank. or they might just float in one place|`|Hxa0lXb3aa	Some float Some sink but their brains are still on. If you bump while there sleeping they go rapid. everything alive drinks, sleeps, and eats.    Dont worry this question has come up a lot.|`|qAwnAYGAaa	Depending on the fish it could sleep one way or another.  All living things sleep because they need it to survive.  They could float there or just swim normally
KOdLWJaQaa	It is not true that smaller dogs don't need walks!!  This seems like a good ammount of time to me.

LAXxaxAZaa	No, they're just different names for the same thing.      Wikipedia says:  "A breastplate (used interchangeably with breastcollar, breaststrap and breastgirth) is a piece of riding equipment used on horses. Its purpose is to keep the saddle or harness from sliding back."|`|Pm8nsCGZaa	I distinguish them by:  Western breast collar   English breastplate  They both do the same thing.

Don't be tempted by your Betta swimming up to the surface when you walk past his aquarium (I hope you don't have him in a bowl or vase) as if he wants to be fed, nearly all fish do this. Remember, a Betta's stomach is only as big as it's eye.|`|Hxa0lXb3aa	That would be enough. You could feed him 3 pellets a day. Also you need some protein foods too. Bloodworms/ Brime shrimp can be good protein sources. Just remember its really fatty so the protein builders should be used as treats and once or twice a week should be fed to the Betta. You don't want to underfeed or overfeed.    GOOD LUCK!!!|`|e9gXZsKxaa	Bettas have tiny stomachs, look at it's eye, that's how big his stomach is. Feed once a day, only 2-4 pellets (depending on size of betta). As for treats they love bloodworms, brine shrimp and blanched peas, once or twice a week. Variety is vital to a betta's health. Fast one day out of the week, this will help further aid in digestion.|`|Dp1CZiJ4aa	A little bit each day. You can feed him every other day but I think he will like being fed a little bit more.|`|KAimfROfaa	I have called the store before, becasue I too have a beta fish named Dakota. The store told me 6 pellets every other day. The reason i called was because he wasn't eating every day, so he will only eat every other day. Now that I have had him for a while, he starting to eat just a tad bit more. Now I give him about 3-6 pellets a day. Sometimes he doesn't eat it all, but that's ok, it's always ok to have leftovers. Try 6 pellets a day and maybe put him on a scheldual, for every other day at around the same time each feeding, but feed him only when he's awake, or else the food could get either gushy by the time he wakes up, or have sunk to the bottom by the time he wakes up.

saZINnopaa	If she is 17 years old, it may be difficult to "teach" her to calm down before jumps, because she is probably just excited and has developed a habit of speeding up. Set up a small cross rail or vertical and practice trotting in, without cantering before the jump, and halting one or two strides after she clears it. As she starts to land, use your voice saying "whoa", sit up and back with your seat in the saddle, and make her halt. If she tries to resist, make her back up a few steps.     As for speeding up before the jumps, try setting up a small gymnastic line, with trot poles in front of the first jump. Set up three or four jumps in the line, and make a bounce to a one stride to a three stride, or some combination like this. Again, make her trot in slowly, and halt immediately at the end. The jumps don't have to be big, but practice this line several times before taking out the trot poles and cantering in. Again, keep doing the line until she calms down and does the whole thing, including the halt at the end, quietly and easily. This should help her learn to slow down rather than just running at the jumps.   Good luck!|`|rQlzfHqraa	The first rule for calming a horse is to calm yourself and the second is to learn the proper way to ride, sit, maintain balance and keep a soft contact on her mouth while getting the message to her. Ask your instructor to watch you ride and jump and then give you pointers as to what you need to do.|`|vZFLG75Zaa	Firstly, she is probably nervous and wants to make sure she clears it.  It is not natural for horses to jump in the wild.  If there is an obstacle in their way, the go around it.  I have had the same problem with my mare.  She was fine, but then rushed to it.  I would suggest trotting up to it from now on... it took my mare a few months to get used to jumping, and now, I can canter over combinations with her and she doesnt mind.  It just takes a lot of patience.  But it will be better in the end.
m4uDn0ofaa	Teach her to "Sit" and "Stay".  Then when you want to open the door tell her to sit and stay and make her stay.  It will take alot of work but the results will be that she won't run thru the door anymore.  And while you are at it teach her the "Come" command as well so if she does run from you, you can call her back.  Use lots and lots of treats.  Good luck.|`|L2Gi2tPmaa	You must teach her that she can not exit the door without you inviting her out.  Before you go for a walk, make her sit and you start to go out the door.  If she gets up, make her sit again.  Then invite her outside.    Check out these websites and videos from Cesar Millan (The Dog Whisperer).|`|B7ciNw0aaa	Put a long, lightweight piece of string on her collar. Tell her to "wait" as you open the door, or just tie the string to your ankle if you can't step on it fast enough.     If she attempts to bolt, step on the string and say "AAT!" as you close the door. If she waits nicely, get some GOOD treats, like liver or chicken, and praise her.    Progress from having the door open an inch for a few seconds to being able to walk out the door slowly.    I wouldn't suggest a shock collar- we had one for our dogs and they quickly learned that the shock would be over soon, and it didn't do anything to prevent the behavior. Not to mention the disaster that would ensue the one time you don't have the shock collar on her.|`|c2d91f8848c790497d198b753a8d3401aa	Train the "Wait' command.  I'd suggest you also train the come command and use a leash.  Dog Obedience classes are so fun and you'll learn many, many useful things for your dog.  And, yes, you can teach and old dog new tricks.    http://www.siriusweb.com/AAD/traintip.ht...|`|kg4aOcKeaa	listen to ellen, she took the words right out of my mouth|`|i7WJdKUqaa	start off my practicing. When the door is shut say sit then stay slowly walk away if it gets up make it sit then stay again. Once you are succesfully at the door with your dog staying like a few feet away open the door a little. Make sure you have a treat in your hand to show him. If he does not stay dont give him the treat and firmly say NO. Keep doing this till he gets this right.|`|R1c4Oq7uaa	The best answer i can think of is a shock collar  as brutal as it sounds they are adjustable for smaller dogs so that it doesnt knock them out.  All you need to do is either turn it on when the dog is around the house (obviously you would need to turn it off to let the dog out) or you could have the remote handy and when the dog runs outside you can send it a shock manually.|`|5b697ae5264bc19d33f3ae5c96b9fb0caa	You need to use a leash. Put the leash on your puppy before you even open the door. Min Pins are noted for having a high energy level. I would read on Dog breed info about training your puppy. Number one, I wouldn't leave the door open, this is an invitation to the outside. Start putting your puppy in a crate so you can leave the door open, if you feel the need to have the door open.|`|DmUG33axaa	they have those shock collars that come with the barrier walls, they are about 50 bucks, you can set the distance, you simply put the little disc by the door (or wherever else) and if she gets within so many feet of it it gives her a warning sound, and then if she proceeds it will give her a little shock, i have 4 dogs, and use these discs in the garbage, couch, door. they are wonderful.|`|PWamfb8paa	do not leave ur door open. dogs  leave to be funny( they also want u to chase them).|`|i6H1HR3Jaa	beat the hell out of that dog when ever it dose it again . that's the way i tough my dog not to poop in my house. tuff love its not easy so sorry .
Ik6WOcw3aa	Just one of them... Yes. Any more would be a big no.    Well, Ive heard different things about their eating habits. For the most part, you could actually feed them crickets and stuff. But if the fish will eat prepared food, Ive heard of people feeding them floating cichlid pellets.    Now, these fish are carnivorous, and their foods should reflect that.|`|9759e8014743debd3d3fd1a7ad437c1faa	It should be fine in a 3-foot long aquarium.  As you probably know, the African Butterfly spends all or almost all of its time at the surface of the water, so the depth of the tank is unimportant for it, but it needs sufficient surface area. It likes to have some floating plants in the water.    It should have some live food, but it needs foods that float, since it only eats from the surface, so floating insects like wingless fruit flies or springtails would be appropriate. It will also eat floating nonliving foods, like freeze-dried foods or small floating pellets. It has also been known to eat small live fish.    The African Butterfly is an interesting fish, one of the true aquarium "oddballs." Surprisingly, it's also one of the older species in the aquarium hobby. People were keeping them back in 1905.    Enjoy yours!
CfUVG6IYaa	I have never heard of this. Most cat litter is made of clay. But you can find litter that's made of different things - like pine, wheat, or even paper.    I have read that heavily scented litter isn't good for cats and the clumping kind contains silica dust, which is a carcinogen, so stay away from those.    I tried the wheat kind of litter for a couple months, but it was such a mess - the cats tracked it all over the house! My cats seem to do best with plain old clay litter like "tidy cats" litter.|`|4TX26viFaa	It's clay, straight from the ground.     Your friend is pulling one over on you OR she mis-heard something and is just passing on bad information.  Animals like cats are small with quick metabolisms, if there was lead they'd be showing lead poisoning within a month or two from exposure.|`|v7CjvhBeaa	I do believe that your friend is just full of it.
uNIHqmH8aa	It depends on what kind of gaming your talking about there's this kind...    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bryG23bBQ...    That would be barrel racing, that kind of thing. Yes, western tack is required for that.    If it's this....(like what I do!)    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRn8ZQa98...    Always done in English    It also depends on where you do it. If it's a big formal thing, there is probably a rule about it. If it's just a little stable show it probably doesn't matter. If there is ever any question, just ask! They'll answer any question!    Good Luck! Have Fun!  -Nov|`|5TCewPYRaa	Some really small shows allow both saddles---I used to hate that---the english snoots would have their little jumping thing in the morning and then come and compete agaisnt us in the gaming like barrels and stuff and they would literally like trot or walk through the patterns and take FOREVER! Please don't be one of those annoying girls....you have your english stuff and we have our western events---we do not take our barrel racers into your jumping course and take down all the jumps so the competition takes longer, so be considerate :)       You would have to ask the judge---but most likely you will have to either suck it up and ride in a western saddle or not compete in western events...you most definitely cannot participate bareback...if you are planning to do any higher level of gaming, you certainly cannot participate in any english tack or attire....|`|e334d47d0cf581231e2545cccfc166e2aa	Games are done in english tack in Pony Club and in Mounted Games Across America (the across america part is only them being hopeful at this point).  Check out their website and see if any competitions are near you:  http://www.mountedgames.org/    If you are young enough to be in Pony Club, they'll do games in pretty much every club.    As far as doing the typical western games in an english saddle, I'd suggest just asking the show organizer if it would be okay.|`|Pm8nsCGZaa	If it is an open show or a play day, usually it does not matter.  I have help open shows and I didn't care.  Many rode bareback poles and barrels.  lol  Just ask the show people if you can.  If it is for fun, it should not matter..however..with all the sue-happy people out there nowadays..probably not many will allow it.|`|UeaZY4BTaa	nope, gaming is based on a western attire, but I don't know why.

hC4Z8HIbaa	Saw dust is the reason they smell so bad. I've never heard someone use saw dust as bedding before, but I can tell you right away it is bad for them in multiple ways. First, wood absorbs urine and makes it smell twice as much as regular bedding. Second, the rats can breathe it in and it can irritate their lungs very badly. You need to switch bedding immediately. You can use Carefresh or Carefresh Ultra (which is less dusty), but some people don't like to because of the smell. I can guarantee, though, that it won't cause as near bad a smell as the bedding you are using now. Other people use Aspen. Although aspen is a wood, it does not cause the urine to smell as badly as your sawdust. Never, ever use pine or cedar for bedding. It has chemicals in the wood that can be very dangerous to any small animal. You could also use fleece. This is what I use. It is absorbant and does not cause near as much odor as paper based litter or wood shavings. It does need to be changed more often, however. A lot of rat people I know use fleece because it is easy, economical (you can wash and reuse the fleece), and fun to decorate with.<br>  <br>  Check out the website below. It is a rat care forum that I am a member of. I highly recommend it to all rat owners.|`|JmD0oq2Naa	first stop using sawdust its bad for them. just rip up some old clothes and use that as bedding, its what i use with my rats, plus its much easier to clean|`|jyGTlpzTaa	You shouldnt be using sawdust for starters, it gives them respiratory problems. Use shredded cardboard, paper cat litter, or plain newspaper with woodbase cat litter in the corners where they pee.<br>  <br>  It is possible you are actually cleaning them too much and they are making deliberate smells so they smell like rats again, also overcleaning will harm their coats. Try laying off with the wet wipes and just cleaning the cage twice a week and see if that helps.|`|280d96ad7b5e9ffad03a34a66cac5db0aa	Saw dust sounds like a pretty messy bedding, and it probably isn't very absorbent or particularly effective in odor control. Everyone has different preferences as far as bedding and litter go, so you might want to try experimenting. Here are some common bedding/litter choices:<br>  - CareFresh Ultra. Regular CareFresh tends to be dusty, which irritates the rats' sensitive respiratory systems.<br>  - Aspen bedding. Many people love the natural scent, although sometimes, people and/or rats develop an allergy to it.<br>  - Polar fleece liners. You simply cut fleece to fit the cage levels, and secure it in some way. If you have wire levels, you can clip the liners in place with safety pins or tiny clothespins, or put weights like clean rocks in each corner. Then you just change the liners every couple days, and toss them in the wash every week. You can double up layers (fleece/fleece, fleece/flannel, fleece/towel) for extra absorbency.<br>  - Yesterday's News. Do you know that rats can be potty-trained? Although you can Yesterday's News (which is very absorbent!) in the entire cage, it's easier to just use it in the litter boxes, and use bedding like fleece or CareFresh Ultra in the rest.<br>  <br>  How big is the cage? The smaller the cage, the stinkier it's likely to be. Each rat requires a minimum of two cubic feet of space. Minimum. <br>  <br>  You aren't using a tank cage, right? Those provide next to no ventilation and are simply unsuitable for rats. The ammonia fumes from their urine build up quickly and damage the respiratory system. These habitats require daily cleaning. You need a wire cage, if you don't have one.<br>  <br>  What are you feeding them? As with any animal, a poor diet results in added odor. A proper diet for rats is a high-quality lab block, as these are formulated to be nutritionally complete for rats. Brands like Harlan Teklad, Oxbow Regal Rat and Mazuri are appropriate choices. (Mazuri is most likely the only one you'll find at the local pet store.) Stay away from seed mixes, they're absolute garbage and are nothing but fatty. (Seeds and such *are* acceptable as once-in-awhile treats, but not a main diet.) Stay away from food brands like Kaytee and Reggie Rat, they're also rubbish. Their diet should then be supplemented with tasty veggies (peas, broccoli, carrots, et cetera!), fruits (bananas, berries, melon, et cetera!) and other treats (dry pasta, soy nuts, et cetera!).<br>  <br>  Don't change the bedding daily, as that will kind of put the rat into marking overdrive and amp up the odor. (That is, unless you use a tank, in which case you do have to clean pretty much daily.) <br>  <br>  Do spot-clean daily (like picking up raisins) to maintain cleanliness. <br>  <br>  If your rats have had any respiratory issues, do clean the bedding in their favorite nesting areas daily or every other day, as they like to pee in there the most.<br>  <br>  When you clean the cage, don't clean everything at once. For instance, change the bedding, but don't change the hammocks until a little bit later. That way, they don't feel like it's all new territory that needs to be re-marked, because their scent is still in there (on the hammocks).<br>  <br>  Make sure you scrub down the entire cage every week to remove any gunky urine build-up and such.<br>  <br>  Try to provide proper ventilation in the entire room. If you have no other pets, leave your door open so that fresh air can cycle in. If you can't leave the door open safely, open the window for awhile. (If it's very cold where you are, don't leave it open too long, or you can simply leave it open a very small amount.)<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT: Listen to Ratnut, Goosemoose is an *incredible* source of information for rat owners!<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT: Oh, and what gender are your rats? If they're male, you might want to have them neutered. Males are typically a little muskier-smelling than females, although it's rarely a problem, unless you have a very sensitive nose. Neutering them will reduce that musky odor.|`|gWlcDZJ6aa	Do NOT use saw dust for bedding! It is VERY bad for them! It gets into their mouths and noses and can cause serious respiratory infections! PLEASE use shredded paper instead! It's safe and free! Get rid of the saw dust first of all and NEVER use it again unless you want your rats to suffer. Clean their cages at least once a week. And if their fur smells, bathe them with either dog shampoo or dawn dish soap, be sure to avoid the eyes, ears, and nose. After bathing them the first time they shouldn't smell much, as they clean themselves multiple times a day. Using saw dust is not only unhealthy for them, but it's where the smell is coming from. The saw dust doesn't exactly absorb any of their droppings & urine. Paper will. PLEASE WASH THEIR CAGE AND CHANGE THE BEDDING ASAP! Either shredded paper or [clean] old towels/rags from now on. Or CareFresh, but it's a bit expensive.<br>  <br>  Also, their diet may be causing the odors. If you buy rat food, get Kaytee brand rat & mouse food (found at petsmart and petco). OR get some ingredients from wal-mart and use homemade food. It contains the daily "doses" of nutrients and proteins that they need on a daily basis, and it lasts WAY longer than a bag of pet store food. The recipe can be found here: <a href="http://www.ratsrule.com/diet.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ratsrule.com/diet.html</a>|`|JNnSMh64aa	Saw dust is not an odorcontrolling bedding. Get Carefresh because it is the best at controlling odors.|`|Mt9E351Naa	dont use saw dust! i was illa adviced when i got my first 2 rats and bought loads and i mean loads of sawdust but one of their eyes was really irrated by it you shouldnt use dusty products because of problems with breathing and eyes etc clean their pooh out every day and any wet patches. i have heard of a cat litter that is really good for absorbing the smell and might have to invest in that i have 4 smelly boys lol. what do you use to wipe your rats down i may try that lol xx|`|0e30db1991b7d2ef05edf73b241560e9aa	Don't use saw dust, use shredded cardboard or an alternative. This is the same bedding that is used for reptiles, it has an odour eater in it. A cage change could then last for a week rather than days. <br>  Lets not forget that rats are very clean animals and like nice clean bedding as well.|`|0GX5nFLQaa	ARE YOUR RATS MALE ?

xyPpruSjaa	You didn't introduce them properly! Make sure the skinny gerbils is getting enough food and water! It could be starving!     Anyway, what you have to do is the split tank method. Get a 10 or 15 gallon aquarium, they're not that expensive don't worry :] What you have to do is take measurements of the length and width and have the hardware store (or you can do it yourself) cut 1 or 2 pieces of mesh according to the measurements. Go to Staples or Office Max or somewhere and buy those clear report covers with those sliding plastic things that hold all the papers together. Use the slidy things (I have a magnificent vocabulary) and slide them onto the sides and bottoms of the mesh to protect your gerbils from the sharp edges. You might have to cut them a little to get them to fit. If you have 2 pieces (which is recommended for extra protection) bind them together at the top with some wire. Wedge it in the aquarium and Wah-la! A perfect barrier! It sounds long and complicated but it only took me like 30 minutes ;D The point of making the barrier is to let the gerbils see, smell, and feel eachother (to a certain extent through the mesh) but they can't hurt eachother. To attach waterbottles to the aquarium use some sticky backed WHITE velcro! Place a water bottle and a food bowl on each side, and toilet paper tubes and a wheel if you can. Females need to stay with the barrier for 2 weeks and males only need about 1 week, if your females are still fighting after, then put them behind the barrier for a little more.    Good luck! I hope I helped, if you have any questions email me at averyrazno@yahoo.com|`|C4V11yJLaa	Perhaps you should seperate them.  what i would do is get a 20 Gallon Tank and put a screen through the middle, that way they can still smell each other with out the fighting.  For the little guy who does not get enough foods with the screen you can provent that with given each of them there own food bowl. After this when they become fimiliar with each others smell you can slowy re-introduce them again.    Hope Dis Helps :D
9759e8014743debd3d3fd1a7ad437c1faa	There are no tropical goldfish. Goldfish originate in the Temperate climate zone. At most, you cold call them sub-tropical.    You don't strictly need a filter with goldfish (or any fish), if you change the water very frequently, but it's much easier to keep your fish healthy if you have a filter, because goldfish put out a lot of waste and tend to make the water dirty pretty fast.    Unlike tropical fishes, goldfish don't need a heater. They are comfortable at cool as well as fairly warm temperatures.|`|4cQSsDaZaa	nope|`|bDPVRtCNaa	There is no such thing as a tropical goldfish, so they don't need heaters. They thrive in oxygen rich cool temperatures.    All fish require filters, especially goldfish. Some people can keep goldfish alive for up to four years without a filter, but they should live at least 15-20 years. Without a filter and an appropriately sized tank goldfish will suffer from ammonia poisoning, stunted growth and a shortened lifespan.|`|jy4QXVYMaa	No, thats not normal, they should have one|`|QJu73ISQaa	No not really.If you want one it is called undergravel|`|ZR25pTOYaa	i think that they do. but i would check with a pet store assistant.|`|eX8i4vwRaa	all fish should have filters.  the only real exception are beta.  even goldfish are better off with them.  i would definitely get one|`|fxH6T7vCaa	My friend has some and she dosen't have none of those things, and they look fine to me.|`|itXKrS1iaa	No, all tropical fish like to bask in their own poo.    Do you like to drink dirty toilet water? Because that's what they're doing right about now. Would you be alive? Sure! Would you be healthy? Definitely not. Would you be happy? If those fish could kill themselves, they probably would have by now (I'm assuming there's a lid on your tank? Take it off for a few days, see what happens ;) )    Fish are animals. Being alive is not the same as being healthy and happy.|`|ksEkWEd2aa	a filter is used just to clean the water, if you clean the water every now and then they should be fine. the only thing fishes need is a source of oxygen, whether it be those blue oxygen bubble things or an oxygen plant.|`|86b135e0c5c7fa8152fab546e88b509caa	Tropical Goldfish? Someone has sold you a lie. ALL Goldfish are coldwater. Keeping them at warm temperatures would cause their metabolism to increase, leave them susceptable to diseases and parasites and shorten their lifespan.    Goldfish must must must have a filter to live properly. They are hugely messy fish and this only increases as they get older. For a pair you should really have at least a 30 gallon tank with exceptional filtration for at least 50 gallons. Fully cycled of course (that would be the nitrogen cycle).    Without these things they are far more likely to get sickly and die.    http://www.theaquariumwiki.com/Goldfish|`|OjXvYEZDaa	No, its not normal. tropical fish/ goldfishes do need a filter to get keep toxic ammonias or nitres away from fish, its quite common about fish get ill or dying by living in tankwater without filter. You should buy one to keep tropical healthly|`|a2cjwMKcaa	Goldfish need a filter but not a heater, they aren't tropical.    While you can keep fish alive without a filter, you have to change MUCH more water, and the conditions aren't ideal for them, so they wont live as long. A filter also makes life easier for you (less water changes needed)    Ian
MhvwRwNKaa	just think how happy you just made those kittens by giving them a loving home... I know how you feel though.. i have 2 turtles myself and i'm planning on giving them away because I have to move and where i'm going i cant take them w/me =( ....

I think you should have kept one for yourself, that's what I would have done, but when I get a new critter I can't stand to let them go. That's probably why I have 7 pets at the moment :)... anyway, don't feel bad hon. You can be assured that all your babies went to loving homes and owners who will love them forever. I recently had to rehome a dog I had named Moka. I had her for almost a year and she was terrified of everyone in my house and wouldn't ever come out of hiding without peeing everywhere. So I gave her to an older man who's wife had recently passed away. I felt so bad giving her up, but I just remembered how that older guy's eyes lit up like Christmas lights when he saw her. He was so thrilled. I still miss her after 4 months, and I cry from time to time, but whenever I really just can't take it I call the guy who has her to see how she's doing. He's even invited me to come visit her but he lives almost 3 hours away so I cant. If you still have the contact info to the people who now have them, ask them if you can call or if they will e-mail you photos.     You'll always have a soft spot for them. But keep in mind that they're well taken care of, and happy.|`|4f48b3e5d4788ae58d8d49522c90a6f9aa	why dont you, seeing as you love Snow Angel so much and she/he is your favourite and has gone to one of your good friends, tell them how you feel and mabye you can keep her...   i wouldnt want to give away kittens...    just ask for her back... im sure your dog wont mind too much as he's been around 7 of them for the past 7 weeks!     and it's good for kittens to get used to other animals.... ask for her back and love that kitty! :)    that's what i would do.... :)    good luck!|`|utWwwIpkaa	That is so sweet, the moron who dumped the kittens certainly picked the right house.

Don't forget about them but treasure their memories and know that you had made the right choice giving them a better home =]|`|hMYT11ucaa	I think that one of the reasons you got so attached was because you saved those kittens and nursed them back to health. If you can, I would go to one of the local animal shelters and get a cat there. And if you get one that's about to be put down once again you will be save a cats life. But be sure that you are ready there's nothing worse for a cat then being returned after an adoption.|`|WLOYtPA1aa	well you could keep it, if you love the cats more than the dog.   If the dog small, it can live with cats.  If it big dog keep him outside and keep cat inside.  By the way, same way happen to me too.  I had to give away 14 kittens.

MKuDawP7aa	Community Aquariums<br>  <br>  A community aquarium is one in which several species can safely cohabitate. It also includes a collection of various plant specimens. All of the different species and varieties in a community aquarium can thrive and get along together, but do not necessarily share the same origins or geographic regions. If you are considering creating a co-inhabited fish tank of your own, there is some planning in consideration that needs to go into your set-up and choice of fish.<br>  <br>  Planning your fish tank<br>  <br>  Make sure you have a clear idea of what you want your tank to look like before you start to create your community. You also need a good understanding of the tank's basic set up and maintenance needs. The goals of having a community aquarium involve providing your fish with a healthy, stable, and stress free environment as well as harboring a beautiful display of your plants and fish.<br>  <br>  Equipment<br>  <br>  Having the proper equipment is essential for tank upkeep. Larger tanks tend to make for better communities because you are afforded more choice in fish species and a greater amount of fish that you can keep. Larger aquariums are also better for your finned friends because they have the benefit of more stable biology and fluctuations in water chemistry are slower to appear. All community aquariums require<br>  <br>  · Filters <br>  · Heaters <br>  · Lighting <br>  · Cover<br>  <br>  Selecting your fish<br>  <br>  The basic idea to keep in mind when stocking your community aquarium is that you want to pick fish that have the same wants needs. This means including fish with the same pH hardness and temperament. You will also want to select fish that inhabit different layers or regions of the tank including bottom, middle, and top dwellers.<br>  <br>  Bringing them home<br>  <br>  Your community tank cannot be overcrowded. A general guideline for fish capacity in a tank is between half to one inch of full grown fish per gallon of water. Make sure you let the tank go through a biological cycle by first putting in a small amount of hardy fish and letting the bacteria colonize the aquarium.|`|1D8tMCYIaa	Well, it's best to cycle your tank before you get any fish to put in it.<br>  <br>  As for the fish, getting guppies, platies and corydoras and a few snails for one type of community.<br>  <br>  Also you can go for certain tetras (all kinds of them), but they can't be in tanks with larger fish due to the possibility of them getting eaten.<br>  <br>  I say check out the site below..I have lived by it since I started the hobby. Getting to know the nitrogen cycle is a great way to start because it's important to know about so your fishies don't die.
FcR8G8hPaa	Herbal remedies represent experiments you are willing to perform on your horse based on nothing more than someone's statement that their version of the experiment did not kill or sicken their horse. This isn't a good idea. When medicating your horse, you should only use medications that have been the subject of extensive study and peer reviewed research. Chamomile and lavender have not had those kinds of studies performed on their use in horses. And while some plants such as locoweed (which induces immediate selenium toxicity followed usually by death) have obvious ill effects, others can simply and silently do damage to liver, spleen or other key organ systems. Why take the chance?<br>  <br>  In addition, problems with calmness are not problems of chemistry. They are problems of training. <br>  <br>  If your horse is nervous and anxious during ring work, you need to start at the beginning: ensure that his lead line handling is light and calm, and that he goes and stops with very light pressure from the lead line. You also need to ensure he knows how to stand in place for a reasonable period. These are the foundations of calmness in a horse.<br>  <br>  Next, you need to make sure that he is comfortable with all areas of the arena. Walk him in hand around the arena and despook him in any areas where he shows tension or shying. This can be done by not allowing him to back away and requiring him to face the scary stimulus. Once he can do that, request a step forward. As he becomes more relaxed you can request that he walk into the scary area and then lead him away. You may need to follow the same process under saddle.<br>  <br>  Under saddle, you need to make sure he understands your aids. OTTB horses often have a set of race training habits that need to be retrained to make them comfortable with the demands of riding. And all horses will experience tension when there is a conflict between go and stop aids, so make sure to leave him on a loose rein or a couple ounce of pressure contact at most. Look for the horse to run faster when released from bit pressure as an example of a race horse habit that will need to be retrained.<br>  <br>  If your horse hasn't had a comprehensive OTTB retrain, look for an experienced and successful OTTB retrainer in your area. At least you can get suggestions and maybe lessons - at most you might enroll your horse in training. If these aren't options for you, there are books at Amazon.<br>  <br>  Getting him calm on the lead and in the arena will help a lot in getting him calm for the trailer. There are plenty of articles on that subject, so I won't get into trailer loading. <br>  <br>  These activities may seem very tedious compared to slipping your horse a dose of some "natural" tranquilizer. But believe me, it is much better, because it solves his problem rather than covering it up and you do not run some unknown or hidden medical risk with your horse.<br>  <br>  Best wishes to you and your horse...|`|TSc8OE4vaa	I used to use b12 on my mare when I boarded at a barn that wasn't ideal.

When a horse is already anxious and their mental state is elevated, no herbs, and few sedatives/barbituates!, are effective. The lavender would likely be appreciated more AFTER a workout, to cool off with and settle post-training, after cleaning her up post-ride. There have been studies in JAVMA regarding efficacy of lavender as a behavior modifying treatment, and it's proven to increase relaxation when already at rest.<br>  <br>  Before investing in a plethora of likely ineffective herbal treatment, see if there is stimuli around or in the ring or trailer when you get her in there. Look for triggers, isolate the cause, and limit her exposure to these when working her until you can desensitize her to these "anxiety inducing" stimuli. <br>  <br>  Is there a horse nearby regularly she doesn't socialize well with? Is there a noise or movement that triggers her angst? Is there a particular exercise or command she resists due to poor past experience associated with that exercise or command? Slowly, with determination and patience, you can help her work with this fear or anxiety, and always be "asking" for something from her, so even if she doesn't follow through or respond to your initial command or request, she does SOMEthing you want, on your terms, with you in a calm controlled and collected state of mind.|`|tWTJ4CSIaa	Go to smartpack.com  They sell supplements and their staff are SUPER knowledgeable, just give them a call and ask what they recommend for your horse specifically.
AA10421992	In my opinion it is the owners choice. Two of my five dogs shares my king size bed.|`|fgxajTiBaa	I've let my dog sleep with me since I got him at 4 months. I don't personally see any problem with it, some people say it creates an Alpha problem, but I have not seen that issue with my dog and he cuddles right up with me. The only thing you should worry about it squishing him since he's so little.|`|tPGxPDvBaa	I believe it is a personal choice.  However until dog is fully house broken & fixed, you are just asking for accidents to happen.  As long as you realize she is a dog & will always smell like a dog(meaning no baths constantly) & sheds dog hair on the bed & in her case shouldn't be jumping up or down(doxie have major back issues) onto bed, then go ahead.  Do be sure if she has to for some reason, that she can still sleep in her crate/bed or wherever not always with you.|`|MURxMnLtaa	it's fine as long as she won't pee on your bed.  If you let her, don't change your mind in 6 months and not let her.  That's mean.|`|6qsocyK3aa	That's a personal choice, there's no right or wrong.

This includes if you ever want to share your bed with someone.|`|RPZyku2Jaa	It's generally considered a bad idea by most dog experts - you're allowing the dog to be your equal by sharing the bed with you.  Best if they sleep in a crate or their own dog bed.|`|SMFhXxcfaa	it depends on your preference.  I personally, am too scared that my pup will jump off the bed because he has to potty and I won't notice, while when he's in the crate he will whine.  If you pup sleeps through the night, you can try it.  You won't know what will happen if you don't try it.  But it's your personal preference.|`|NyNaJmIkaa	people can do what they want but I don't like my dog on my bed.  To go along with the other answers, I noticed people who let there dogs sleep with them, tend to have dogs that are stubborn and spoiled, and don't listen.    I don't think sleeping in the bed is the cause of this exactly.  My dog sleeps with the kids or on the couch but is still obedient to everyone in the house.    I think the issue is that typically owners who let dogs sleep with them, tend to treat the dog like a baby or equal. Take my roommate for example.     Treats her dogs like babies. Lets them sleep with her and one has bad flea allergies, skin problems  and stinks and constantly scratches and drools and breaths loud and grunts. It's a Shar Pei. I barely will to touch it much less would let it sleep with me.    My roommates stubborn dogs after 2 months of staying here are FINALLY beginning to understand the word MOVE! and know not to jump on my bed. They are all over the furniture tho and I had to scrub barf of the couch cushion just today.      When she first moved in the dogs would beg constantly while I was cooking and ALWAYS stand in the way or underfoot begging. At least now they see me coming and get out of the way or I point and they go in the other room. When she lets them out to use the bathroom she will stand there yelling for 5 minutes for them to come and they completely ignore her. Prime example of spoiled dogs with no discipline.     This is my list of reasons I won't let any dog sleep with me. Dander, shedding, dirt, what if it pukes on the bed, hogs the bed, gets mange, a tick, fleas, has skin problems and smells bad, farts, relieves itself, jumps on you in the night, my husbands got a 6 inch long scratch on his chest because the dog leaped onto him when he was laying on the couch.    To each his own though.    Are you having any problems with housebreaking? If so a dog crate is the way to go.  http://www.ehow.com/how_4720124_housetra...|`|gADpKFktaa	My small dog sleep with me never had a problem, but I don't move alot when sleep and they like to sleep at or near my legs.|`|vn5Y7qgsaa	Yes but invest in a a ramp down to the floor.  Train your doxie to use the ramp.  Indoor vs outdoor potty training is an issue too.  Until trained maybe get up once at night and take them to the potty area.  Don't squish the doxie like if you roll over.     I use to let my doxie sleep with me and if he had to go potty he would go down the ramp and go potty inside and then come back to bed.  Cool huh?  Then I got married...    It might take you some time to have this happen.  It is wonderful though once they get use to being in bed with you.  They love it and you will find it adorable, heartwarming, a comfort, etc.      The doxie may make a few "mistakes" in your bed.  They can get overheated too under the covers and get sick so beware.    All in all though it is wonderful.

Just make sure your dog doesn't take up the whole bed, like my dog does, he stretches out as far as he can, but I let him be, because he's cute, sleeping and i dont want to wake him up, or disturb him.|`|A9qDWpXUaa	A lot of people let their dogs sleep on the bed with them and it works fine. As to the Alpha problem / idea just make sure from the start that you control the space, i.e. you say when she can get on and when she gets off, not her.     Also, as someone has already said, if you don't share your bed with another person at this time, what if you do in the future? I have one dog who sleeps upstairs but on the floor a the side of the bed or on the landing.  I let him up for a few minutes "cuddle time" when I go up (not something I admit to to dog trainer / behaviourist friends!) and my husband kicks him off (metaphorically speaking) when he does! We are all happy with this arrangement as it works for us.    The dog mentioned above is a retired working dog who is now a bit "spoiled", can suffer from selective deafness now and then and is sometimes a bit slow to respond to commands. I don't put this down to now letting him sleep upstairs with  us but not keeping on the ball with training and generally allowing him to get away with things I never would have when he was working. When in work he was very responsive / obedient etc. as my other 2 dogs are but they are not allowed upstairs. From my own experiance I find it to be true that dogs allowed access to the bed / bedroom are treated differently to dogs who are not and are allowed little liberties which can ultimatley create a monster if not kept in check which is why even though retired my dog still has to "work" each day for me (in as much as his doggy hips will let him).|`|T0lEgekfaa	I would say you shouldn't. I let my wiener sleep with me and have created a monster! They become to human, dogs should sleep on the floor in their own bed.
9UZIgQvzaa	No, I think he may be a little small, but he is fine. There are really small cats sometimes. One of my friends has a cat that had kittens recently and she is tiny. She is a little bit bigger than your description. Maybe 16 inches long, and 10 pounds. Really she is tiny.      So no your cat is not too small. I think when they are small they always look like kittens, and it just makes me want to kiss them. So consider yourself lucky, you have an overly cute cat. :)    P.S.

tWTJ4CSIaa	4 things really catch my eye as problematic:<br>  <br>  1. you seem very unbalanced.  The only way to imporve this is to ride more on the flat.  When working on the flat, do lots of schooling figures, circles, figure eights, serpentines etc at every gait (starting at the walk).  Close your leg around your horse and sit down a bit.  <br>  <br>  2. Your leg is VERY weak, I'm not saying this to be mean but if you watch, as you jump your leg flies back, throwing your center of balance off and causing you to fall after the fence.  To imporve your leg strength, ride more on the flat and drop your stirrups (I know it will feel impossible at first) Try walking while keeping your leg as if it were in the stirrup, once you can do that, try a sitting trot and hold your leg at the same place (AND STILL) Take a break from jumping until you have control over your body at a walk trot and canter without stirrups.<br>  <br>  3. You are throwing your upperbody at the fence.  A wise trainer once told me to WAIT for the horse to jump up to me, don't 2 point in anticipation of the jump, only once your horse takes off.  Also, sit down a bit in front of the fence and think "keep my shoulders away from the fence"  It will keep you from getting refusals because the horse won't have control until he is in the air.<br>  <br>  4. You also have a lack in confidence that the horse is going to jump at all, so you are suprised when he does.  Once you have built up more balance and strength, start by riding over poles, then piles of 3 pole, then tiny tiny cross rails, then fott high cross rails, then 2 foot cross rails, but only move up after your horse does it for a few days without refusing.  This will build both your and his confidence.  <br>  <br>  My personal opinion: Your trainer should NOT have started you jumping yet, you are not quite ready.  But work hard and you will be in no time!  Good luck.|`|2O58btqxaa	i carnt view ur video sorry|`|RloOJ43haa	1. When your horse runs out, it is a steering problem. You need to steer him back on the track that YOU choose. So, if he ducks out right, you correct him back to the left. Do not continue going right. <br>  2. If your trainer is laughing at you and not helping you to progress, it is time for a new trainer. <br>  3. You are ducking your shoulders before you get to the jump which rocks you forward. Then when your horse ducks or overjump, you are already very loose. <br>  4. As another posted said, you leg is very loose. It is your base of support and it must be strong to make it over the jumps. <br>  5. Actually, you had 2-3 good trips over the wall. Your horse just overjumped.|`|ajj7ATyAaa	You need a much stronger base of support.  You are about fifteen steps ahead of your horse in that you are flinging yourself at the jump before the horse has even taken off.  As such, he's just stuck out there by himself and can do whatever he wants.  And with your leg slipping back, good bye seat security and hello a tasty snack of dirt....    Stay back  with your horse, give him a supportive ride up to the jump.  It's not such a huge jump that you have to lean that far forward- open up your hip angle and keep your butt down in that saddle right until take off.  <br>  I think I would also drop your stirrups a hole.  I know he's a smallish horse, but you need to stretch down around your horse, and a longer leather just might let you do that.  <br>  <br>  I would probably stick to some confidence building cross rails, do a bunch of cavaletti grids leading up to the cross rails, that way you really get a feel for what exactly he's doing underneath you, when he's taking off, when he's committed to the jump.<br>  <br>  And if your instructor can't be more helpful than that, it might be time to look for a new one.  There are a lot more so so to crummy instructors in the world than good ones, and good ones are definitely worth the money if you want to ride well and not end up hurt all the time...|`|5i8lDbXfaa	Ok i agree with most of the above comments on your body position, I don't feel like repeating all of them.<br>  -Don't lean in too soon (let the horse move you up the first couple of times)<br>  -Go back to some smaller jumps so the horse learns to jump properly<br>  -Do more of the x jumps, the horse will want to jump in the middle because it is lower.  <br>  -don't jump the wall till he does the smaller jumps consistently well.<br>  <br>  <br>  Some the clips show the horse (cute btw) bolting from the jump.  <br>  This is where you need to go back into some ground training, the horse is not trusting you to guide him safely over the jump.  Lounge work will help build trust.  <br>  <br>  Another way to keep the horse focused on the jump and prevent ducking and bolting is putting up poles that run perpendicular to the jump.  Like the one in this link, you can set some that longer to create a tunnel. <br>   <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mhecLr6Veo&feature=PlayList&p=D27F4BE203B26E45&playnext=1&index=14" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mhecLr6V...</a>  <br>  (This is not me in the video! LOL)|`|AA11498082	Agree with FQH and Arw -  YOU need a lot more miles before attempting to jump.  You're maintaining your ballance by hanging on his mouth.  YOU caused the first run out -- watch and see -- yanking on the right rein.<br>  <br>  Look at your horse's mouth in the videos - wide open because of your hands.|`|4884c661c8938910239d7729a16fc338aa	You are hunching over and really anticipating the jumps. Let your horse fold you. If they run out and you are already forward then you are going to eat some dirt.<br>  <br>  Build you leg mussles. When you jump your legs fly back and it throws you off balence. Think "keep you leg under you and your heel down.|`|sKZbK6Y5aa	You can prevent this by  Going  back to your basic groundwork.  Become a stronger rider first!!   you are not a terrible rider but get your flat work down first before you start jumping. i see so many people jumping with out having the basics down.  you will have more fun jumping if you have a good strong seat.  good luck!!|`|NJdupXBKaa	First off all I'd like to say your horse is beautiful...<br>  You need to put your heels down. I know you know that though. But it's so important if you want to keep a good seat. <br>  Sit up and have a good contact on your rein.<br>  As you approach the jump you are not telling the pony to jump. You need to drive them into the jump with your seat and nudge with your heels if you need to. Don't force an unnatural jumping position. Just fold at the hips as you come over the jump and sit up after the fence. This might stop you falling off.<br>   If your having running out problems maybe try carrying a crop and using it on the side your pony runs out at (they normally favour one side).<br>  Good Luck :)<br>  xx|`|9BwQMXycaa	ok so you actually pointed them all out perfectly..apart from one.  You should not go into a half seat since this does make you lean forward and that is what you do not want to do.  here is what i suggest:<br>  try going back to basics.  Do alot of pole work and cavaletti work.  If you do lines at the canter with only poles, you wont have as much of a feeling of wanting to lean forward, also, try doing so without stirrups.  It will help!! trust me!!!<br>  <br>  hope i've helped!|`|u45B1OYiaa	use a crop!! whack him till he goes over and squeez your legs, get in a better half seet two.|`|Fmq1YEtyaa	i saw the vid but im not sure what ur question is

The "newness" will wear off in a few weeks, probably, and he may become the cuddle bunny that he used to be.  BUT, he may not, either.  Now that there's someone else for him to love, you may have to play "second fiddle" to her.    If he hasn't been neutered, the time to do it is NOW.......A female kitten CAN come into heat at 16 weeks......and that's waaaaay too young to get pregnant.  IF / WHEN she comes into heat, if he has NOT been neutered, he'll try to breed her, and may start to spray/mark his territory.  NASTY BUSINESS.........    Having her spayed soon, is a good idea, too.  Then, you won't have to go through the "drama" of the heat cycle.......moaning, howling, rolling around on the floor w/butt stuck in air, trying to get outside.....etc.    Spayed and neutered cats have less risk of developing CANCER ( uterus/female, mammary (breast) glands/female, and testicular/male) in later years.  Unlike what some people think, females do NOT have to have a litter to "fulfill" themselves......that's a "human" concept.    So......if you want to have a "drama" free life, get both of them "fixed"..ASAP.  They'll live longer, healthier and happier lives for it.  And you'll benefit from the absence of the "drama" and the worry of the later year cancers........    Don't be mad at your male......he now has a new friend!!  Hope this helps.......Good luck.|`|1EOf9DbQaa	he is jealous spend time with him and he will learn you still love him|`|7WUvPI8maa	it could be that he is still getting used to the new kitten. give him some time to adjust to the new addition. our cat had the same problem when i was fostering a kitten from my college. after some time she got used to the other and started to behave like her old self again. hope this helps. good luck.|`|jcuh49u8aa	he still loves you but just hates her|`|WLOYtPA1aa	Did you know Male cats don't like kitten?  Well, He hate to see you petting, and or she probably  don't want him come near the kitten. Females cats hates Males cat around the kitten. He can kill the kittens if he want to.  So keep your eyes on them, or he might hurt them.
AA11443269	If memory serves correctly the Rot has a slow growing skeletal structure, especially the legs and it could be growing pains. But you might want to have them x-rayed and examined to make sure that they are not early signs of another ailment.     This is your dog, she will be yu for a long time; I would try another vet - you know a second opinion    Hopefully this will only be a winter affliction. But you might want to give your dog a food supplement with Glucosamine with Condriton and MSN. I have been giving it to one of my dogs with wonderful success, in the past I took it with no success. You can get it rather cheaply at Costcos    Has your dog ever (recently) run loose, where she could have gotten a scare?    Let me know what happens|`|mTcUaxwpaa	Rotti's are very procetive and quite lazy most rotti's do do this, my friend has one and it sleeps all day and night and it's only a year old .|`|L2Gi2tPmaa	Sounds like she really isn't tired but just want to retreat back home to where she feels safe.    You must make her face her fears.  When she stops, keep moving forward.  You could also put a treat in front of her nose if you feel she really doesn't want to move.      Don't indulge her nervousness or coddle her if she plays up or gets nervous. If you react to her crying and trembling with petting and cooing, you are telling her that it's OK to feel like that. If she's nervous, either ignore it and carry on, or distract her with a game or short walk. If she's still panic-stricken after three or four minutes, revert to the previous step and give it more time.|`|MURxMnLtaa	young giant breed dogs get tired quickly when they're that young...if you force her to walk long distances and overexert her, you can damage her joints permanently.|`|gg2aJXoDaa	Take it of the lead, dumbdumb.|`|MvX2Hg9Taa	I have a mastiff and she does the same thing, they're still young it hard for them to walk far. They'll get better!!|`|rIzx4OEWaa	Do yourself a favour an buy a book about the breed written by someone who breeds them they will tell you all you need to know. dogs can get tired but it can depend on where you walk them change the walk each day make it interesting for yourself as well, streets are fine for keeping the claws down but parks are more interesting as are the woods. If you can go down to the beach for the day or take a train ride into the countryside an walk it there. The dog could just be bored with the same type of walk each day take something with you to make it fun, there are many ways to enjoy your life together I hope you both have some great times ahead.|`|9kTejB0uaa	This is a large breed.  At 6 months she's still very young and should not be over exercised.  If you do try to push her too far, too fast, she may well injure herself and will end up forever on '3 legs'.  Take it way more slowly with her - actually off lead exercise at this stage (provided you have a safe place and she's good on recall) is marginally better than organised road work.  It's worth taking the time to allow her muscles to build up to support her large bone now, rather than trying to force this.  By a year, she should be walking as far as you want.  But not now!  Listen to her - she's telling you.
xrhPrLSHaa	My maltese used to do this (and still does, occasionally, especially when I wear baggy pants like PJs). The thing is, if you keep walking while the dog has a hold of you, then it becomes a game of tug-a-war. What I did, which was more or less successful, is simply stop in my tracks and say "No" firmly. I wouldn't start walking again until she let go. The problem with this practice, however, is that it requires a LOT of repetition and time. Good luck with your chihuahua!|`|KhjpmxGeaa	He wants to play,But I would stop him from doing it before he is a adult.When they are grown and spoilt like most little dogs they will not listen to you.But if you train your dog while its young then he will not do this when he is grown.Try getting him some toys something that has little trigs for im to play with (:|`|SMFhXxcfaa	I think he's dominating you.  He's trying to "herd" you and tell you what to do and where to go.  You need to obedience train him.

I dont think he is trying to "herd" you because he is not a herding breed.      I have a 1 year old dingo and every time i walk with sandals or slippers or socks she is right behind me bitting my ankles. every she does that i will stop and tun around and tell her no. Now that i have done that for 2 or 3 weeks, she doesnt bite my ankle but does it a few times a day.
U1RcZjqJaa	My American Bulldog is about a year and a half now and we have had him for close to a year. His previous owners ran a daycare out of their house and took him to the dog park almost daily. Since we've had him we've only had him around one kid (she was 2) and he adored her. She would climb and tug and give him treats. We think he did so well because he was around kids so much when he was a puppy.     As for dogs, he is kind of temperamental about them. There have been 2 dogs he hasn't gotten along with (one was male one was female) so we aren't sure why he didn't like them. He does play rather rough with other dogs so around little puppys and small dogs we have to watch him, not out of aggression, he just doesn't understand that he can't play so rough. American bulldogs are a type of breed that need to be socialized at a young age, so if you do get one I'd recommend taking it to a dog park often or having dogs that it can interact with regularly.    He, just like most dogs, barks when the door bell rings or somebody knocks, but absolutely loves people. His bark is enough to turn away people that are supposed to be at your house, but we haven't encountered a time when he would actually need to be a guard dog. They sure can be scary looking though!    As for excerise, he loves running, walks, fetch, and sometimes swimming! If we want to go hiking all day he is more than excited but the days we just want to lay around, he lays right with us. He seem to feed off our our engery very well.    Training is the only area we've had some issues. He is fully potty trained and does great off leash, but things like sit, lay out, stay, etc. he is stubborn with. If treats are present he will do it, but if there are no treats and he doesn't feel like doing it we are s.o.l.    I will forever own an American bulldog after him. And as long as you socialized them early and continue to socialize them, you should do just fine.    Sorry this is long but I hope this helps!|`|OnZDg0AEaa	hi,    Bulldogs originally were used to drive cattle to market and to compete in a bloody sport called bullbaiting. Today, they're gentle companions who love kids. A brief walk and a nap on the sofa is just their speed.  here's more info:  http://www.mediumurl.com/?r=522477256107...    hope this helps.|`|BGCNS3vPaa	i have 2 american bulldogs (standard/scott/performance type)...        Good on the leash      Easy to train if consistent and start young      Great watch dogs (once they  were mature at about 2 1/2 years)      Mine are great around dog and all types of animals.  I haven't really had them around kids much, but seem to be fine.  (i still watch them tho).  American Bulldogs NEED early socialization, but shouldn't stop there.      Walk/Jog for about an hour would be great.  they are  high energy breed so the more exercise the better.      I have seen a lot of people go from rottys to american bulldogs.  To me i have noticed that they are a little calmer then a pit bull. ( i have fostered a few and worked in a kennel)  They are nothing like a collie or a gshep..    feel free to e-mail me for any info or help picking one out or anything...  i love the breed and am always willing to talk bulldog.  I also know a few places where you can get a lot of information.  peanutbutter_nj@yahoo.com

giWvSwqRaa	No, you need to bring it back.
NnYB9eXiaa	Snacks:    Note: Because dwarf hamsters are somewhat prone to diabetes, it is prudent to avoid much sugar in their diet, so avoid fruits as treats for dwarf hamsters. Items with *** should not be given to dwarf hamsters!      Some suggested fruits and vegetables:    *** apples (no seeds!)  *** bananas  *** blueberries  * broccoli  * carrots  * cauliflower  * cucumber  * dandelions greens  *** grapes  * kale  *** peas  * potato (cooked)  * romaine lettuce - not iceberg  * spinach  *** strawberries  *** sweet potato  * squash    Other treats:    * hay   * whole grain bread or toast  * whole wheat pasta (cooked)  * brown rice (cooked)  * whole grain cereal (no sugary cereal)  * meal worms  * crickets or  * small pieces of cooked chicken  * bit of hard boiled eggs  * nuts (no almonds; unsalted) - in moderation  * unsalted peanuts - in moderation  * pumpkin seeds  * lentils  * sunflower seeds - in moderation  * plain air popped popcorn (no butter or salt!)    What to Avoid    * celery (the fiber strings can choke them)  * raw beans  * raw potatoes  * almonds  * citrus fruit  * garlic  * onions  * rhubarb leaves or raw rhubarb  * chocolate  * any sugary or salty foods  * any junk food    Entertainment:    With some good out-of-cage activity, you don't need to worry about having an "amazing omg cage that has everything in it" - the cage should be your hamsters home and safe zone. You'll of course want a wheel, home, chewing things in there, but leave as much space as possible!    Hamsters get bored very very easily. A giant box full of different toys,a bowl of chinchilla bath sand (not dust!), a maze made out of paper towel and TP tubes are all fabulous ideas. You can get a really big plastic bin at any big store like Walmart or Target for under $10. A big thick cardboard box with even more walls and doorways made of cardboard can be even better because it's free - just be sure you check it before you place the hamster in each time for any holes or signs of potential holes :)    Place your hamster in his or her "play zone" whenever you want to play with it. Hide treats in the tubes so they can be discovered. You can make homemade wooden toys out of interlocking craft sticks that look like popsicle sticks - and they're great for their teeth as well.    And handle your hamster a lot - as someone else said - personal attention is the best way to bond with your hamster.|`|lLQunBRaaa	a habitrail? they're annoying but they work, also the ball that they roll around in, that's cool too. oh, you can also just use the cardboard from the papertowel things and toilet paper things, they'll chew it up eventually but they're pretty functional. as far as creative snacks? no meat, no dairy, nothing too salty, but they will eat anything. dried fruits and nuts are pretty good for them.|`|uXQVkNt7aa	You should feed it potato chips. i tried that it like i dont noe the rest|`|C4V11yJLaa	Okay so,    Snax: Yoghurt Drops are something Hammies will Love, and chew sticks.    socialization : At Petsmart I Saw some "Play-Pens" That you set up and play with your Ham with out losing them, another way is to set your cage on the floor and play with ham inside his/her cage.    Hope Dis Helped :D    Sky|`|xtRm5NV5aa	As far as things you have in your home -  Snacks: CARROTS! My hamsters love baby carrots. If you're concerned it might be too big, cut it up. Celery, too. They love veggies (they need to chew or their teeth can grow too long and pose a health risk) so that's a great thing.  Play: Cardboard tubes, definitely. Let them run around with your supervision. It's good for exercise as well as keeping their interest.  Cage: Hmm...you can get a plastic crate, especially the clear ones. Other than that, I'm all for your basic wire and plastic cage. One of my hamsters crawls all over those things and it's a great workout.|`|mTJ8wTs3aa	One of my favorite treats to give to my hamster is a special treat that I make. I take a toilet paper tube and coat the inside with a little bit of peanut butter. Then I stick bits of nuts and vegetables on the inside of it and finally wrap it in tissue paper and tie up the ends so it looks like a little present. They have lots of fun chewing it up. Make sure to take out anything uneaten after a day or two.    The best thing you can do with our hamster is to play with it. It sounds kind of boring, but it's true. You can give a hamster plenty of toys, but it's the interaction with you that really counts in bonding.    I have heard that you can use a plastic storage bin with some aeration hole cut near the top as a cage, but I wouldn't recommend it as escape is possible for a clever hamster. There's not much else you can do unless you're prepared to do some serious labor.    The best tip that I can give you is to spend as much time with your hamster as you can. The average (Syrian) hamster lifespan is about 2-3 years. This might seem like a long time, but hamsters are a pet that are easy to forget until it's too late. Hamsters are wonderful little pets and you should make sure to enjoy them while you can. Have fun!|`|v6yMBpB0aa	i used a clear plastic tub for my hamster's cage. she lived for 3 years in it...but sometimes they tend to chew on the plastic so we had to use duct tape in certain places. my hamster loved kleenexs, she would chew them up and store them in her cheeks. i always had fun using my hamster ball but if you want good interaction and bonding you can just hold it. my hamster also loved peanuts but make sure theyre unsalted
gWMMD81Jaa	My German Shepherd, Hildy, goes outside in our fenced in yard during the day when I am at work. I got home and went to open the fence to get her and I could tell something was not quite right. Her fur was soaking wet and muddy, which was weird because it was a sunny day. I walked into the fenced in area and went around to the side of the house and could see water everywhere. Hildy likes to put her toys into her water bucket. When she did that, her paw hit the water spigot, turning it on. It must have been on all day long. Our back yard slopes down and it created a slip-n-slide. She looked at me, ran over to the hill and slide down. She got up and did it again. She was covered from head to toe with mud. She looked so happy and was having so much fun. That's why we call it "Hildy's best day ever".|`|l0R7BiJkaa	My bunny pounced on my feet a few days ago. :]|`|c09015d055d4ed9fd5940c775d1850a4aa	I had a Brenese Mt dog mixture and she was so cool. She would wait until I was done in the kitchen, standing at the bottom of the stairs, so we could go up to bed together. Sometimes she would growl at me if she thought I was taking too long. She also knew when she saw the laundry basket that we were going outside to hang up clothes.|`|BlpJnZOoaa	my bunny went wild the day we got her       so we bought her home went to a 4 hr long movie when we came back my thought we should let her run around(since she was in her cage) she pooped everywhere cut some wires but was having fun! took 2 hrs to catch hr my sister slept in the next day|`|1YYmQI5Naa	I was reading a book and my chinchilla was running around, he kept trying to get me to chase him but I ignored him.

6KxBqnstaa	She is probably just stunned. Watch her close. Make sure she gets her balance back and can fly and her head is not bobbing and or shaking and she is not wobbly. Some birds actually knock themselves out and are ok. That is not to say they do not or cannot suffer internal head trauma. I would keep her quiet and warm and if not 100% by tomorrow would make a vet visit. Also from now on I would put curtains or a blanket over the glass door  so she does not think she can fly through it to get to you or anything else as they seem to think they can. Good luck. I hope she is ok.|`|ZAljSeERaa	she will be fine i think it just knocked her silly usually when it hurts them it breaks their necks so i think you are okay if anything just a sore head and a headache|`|xGmbEzOZaa	She's probably in shock from flying into the glass door. If she isn't her normal self by tomorrow morning, I'd definitely take her to the veterinarian. The feathers will grow back.
K0uTjeWiaa	You realize a few old wives tales that get passed around forever. Please learn about feline nutrition. If you feed the right foods then the cats can determine how much        Nutrition since there are so many bad things out there is very important to your cats health  Contrary to what you may have heard; dry foods are not a great thing to feed a cat.   Please read the label on what you are feeding? What are the ingredients? Do you know what they mean? Is the first ingrediant a muscle meat like chicken or meal or other things?  http://www.catinfo.org/ Learn_How_To_Rea...  http://iml.jou.ufl.edu/projects/Spring04...  Dry foods are the number 1 cause of diabetes in cats as well as being a huge contributing factor to kidney disease, obesity, crystals, u.t.is and a host of other problems. Food allergies are very common when feeding dry foods. Rashes, scabs behind the tail and on the chin are all symptoms  The problems associated with Dry food is that they are loaded with grains and carbohydrates which many cats (carnivores) cannot process.  Also, Most of the moisture a cat needs is suppose to be in the food but in  Dry, 95% of it is zapped out of dry foods in the processing. Another thing, most use horrible ingredients and don't use a muscle meat as the primary ingredient and use vegetable based protein versus animal. Not good for an animal that has to eat meat to survive.  http://www.catinfo.org/ My_Cat_is_Doing_...  You want to pick a canned food w/o gravy (gravy=carbs) that uses a muscle meat as the first ingredient and doesn't have corn at least in the first 3 ingredients if at all.      THE  BEST CAT FOODS CONTAIN NO GRAINS NO BYPOODUCTS NO MEAL  Cats are meat eaters not cereal or rice eaters   Fancy feast is a middle grade food with 9lives, friskies  whiskas lower grade canned and wellness and merrick upper grade human quality foods. I would rather feed a middle grade canned food then the top of the line dry food.   Also, dry food is not proven to be better for teeth. Does a hard pretzel clean your teeth or do pieces of it get stuck? http://www.felinefuture.com/nutrition/bp...     Please read about cat nutrition.   http://www.catinfo.org/                                   http://www.catinfo.org/feline_obesity.ht...        http://maxshouse.com/feline_nutrition.ht...     Vetinarian diets  The reason your vet thinks so highly of the pet food they sell probably has more to do with money than nutrition. In vet school, the only classes offered on nutrition usually last a few weeks, and are taught by representatives from the pet food companies. Vet students may also receive free food for their own dogs and cats at home. They could get an Iams notebook, a Purina purse and some free pizza.  http://iml.jou.ufl.edu/projects/Spring04...|`|YsQQ30YJaa	I have 3 cats. I leave dry out all the time and only feed canned food a little in the morning and at night. The dry I use is Friskies Signature blend and the "wet" is Friskies Ocean Whitefish and Tuna.All of my cats are healthy and in good shape. Mine have a cat door and come and go as they please. My yard is good sized but they usually stay inside during the winter.Fortunately we have no fleas or worms here in Reno like we did back in California.I give each of them a decent fork full of the wet food twice a day, about 1/3 of a small can worth although I buy the large cans for .70 cents a can at Wal Mart.|`|aqY13vWNaa	Use Beneful. Feed them one- two cups of dog food in the morning, afternoon, and night, hope this helped!|`|SMFhXxcfaa	I recommend blue buffalo.  as for how much to feed, there should be directions on the side of any bag of cat food.  just follow it according to your cats weight.I have a 9 lb cat and he gets about 1/4 cup twice a day and my 8 lb female gets a little less than that.  if I give them too much they also puke up the food. so you may need to adjust the amount to prevent your cats from puking
1YYmQI5Naa	It's not good to get them wet, but you can get a washcloth and just barely dampen it with warm water. Try that. Do you have a sand bath in the cage?|`|oPrq7v7Saa	You can dampen a washcloth to clean your chinchilla or use an unscented baby wipe. After you clean your chinchilla, let her take a dust bath to take care of any damp fur. It's ok to get a chinchilla wet, but you shouldn't soak her. Your chinchilla will be fine because your not emerging her body in water. Even if you had to emerge her body in water, you just have to be sure to towel dry her very well and blow dry her on low setting.|`|SZ9Cm5f2aa	Try BabyWipes.  I don't think getting their fur wet will make it get damaged cause I've seen them at the beach be4.|`|2Go0Y0xnaa	Generally an unscented baby wipe and lots of dust baths will take care of most problems in the fur.  If you must get her wet, be sure that after she is cleaned you dry her thoroughly, and completely, with a blow drier set on the low cool setting.  You want to be sure to get her dry all the way down to the skin, so you don't have a fungus issue develop.  Fungus is a real pain to deal with.
HovlTWlNaa	It is very normal.  She is just playing but if she keeps doing it my aunt mad a little discipline toy.  It is a regular soda bottle with little beads in them.  If they didn't little she will shake it and they will stop.  Try to do that if not then get a rolled up newspaper and just smack them once and whenever they do something bad smack your hand loud enough they will think they got hit.|`|AzeOk29saa	My kitty does this to me all the time.  If you have an extremely friendly dog, then try to get the cat to nibble on him.    That's what I do (I have a beagle-hound) and they get along fine.  My dog bites my kitten's legs, while my kitten bites my dog's ears.  It's all good fun for them.    If that's not possible, then I think the only answer is to suck it up.|`|ixkClYjOaa	Well was she taken away from her mother too quickly?|`|0d9a6DQvaa	He/She is probably teething, it happens to almost every animal when they're at that age, just give her/him some time and she/he will stop biting eventually when she grows out of it.

43bb1de059cf4886a340467b97276fecaa	Droppings changing color can indicate a change in feed, but in some cases it can indicate trouble with an intestinal parasite. Coccidia, for example, tend to turn the feces lighter in color and makes them somewhat softer than normal. Your rabbit's poop could also be changing because he is growing and phisically changing.    Also, what *could* be happening here--if her feces look undigested--is that she is having liver problems, and her digestive enzymes are not doing their proper work. This last option would be quite unusual, but it might bear checking. Your vet can determine her hepatic health with a blood test to check whether her liver enzymes are elevated. At the same time, it would be a good idea to do a complete CBC to assess the state of her kidneys, and a blood count to see whether there is any evidence of infection (e.g., unusually high or unusually low white blood count) or other problem (anemia).      Call your vet.  Good luck! ~|`|CdBdP2ymaa	They are M&M's...but don't eat them.|`|aG20ruqYaa	yea u might wanna call ur vet about it.

MURxMnLtaa	You should be able to change your reservation up to 24 hours of your stay there, so you can still find a hotel that will allow your dog.

Now it will cost you more money to find a place for it to stay. Naturally your dog will not eat until you come home. I have checked behind many people telling me they left their dog, and it didn't eat while they boarded.  I would leave it with a relative, or have some one come over and take it out, and sit with it for a while, so it won't be lonely.
rQlzfHqraa	If you do not feel any heat anywhere along the leg and especially the joints to identify the area with a problem you should call the vet on the first day. Never have I experienced a leg problem getting better on its own.|`|Czh1fbQgaa	CALL THE VET!|`|cIh5EI3eaa	Actually I would call a respectable vet who knows what there doing. But if you dont want to do that it may be sore and some hidden swelling etc. Rub it down with linemant. It will work any soreness out and circulate the blood. I would wrap it as well to lock in the heat for better results. I have been around horses all my life. Been through horse shows to racing now. I have learned through the years.
oMTsDcNBaa	Oh, gosh, you gotta be kidding! She WILL DIE out in the wild. There is no safe place for a hamster outdoors. And hamsters always want to escape their cages!     If you don't want her anymore, at least drop her off at an animal shelter?|`|4VrKKOwnaa	hahaha thats cute, take her back to the pet store, she'd die to quick in the wild|`|2ZUDlLCjaa	pet store it will die in the wild|`|49ec8e0944023c0f5c20e37484f16366aa	You can't release a hamster in the wild, they're domesticated rodents.  Take her back to where you got her, or ask vet offices if you can post an ad there for a free hamster.  She'll die quickly of exposure if you set her loose.|`|JmD0oq2Naa	give her to a shelter that will find her a new loving home. you cant set her free she will die straight away|`|nmzpdvkqaa	i can take her my snake is geting hungry|`|BaNrweQ4aa	hamsters live in cages; it's just what they do and even if they try to escape. they can't. they can't be set free into a random place because hamsters can't survive on their own. they need all the love and attention but it just takes time to get used to your hamster. dwarf hamsters are very small so therefore hare to handle, but syrians are much better. if you really don't want your hamster then just take her back to the pet shop where you got her from, or another one. maybe a friend or a family member may want the hamster :)|`|4SQx8smEaa	She will be eaten in matter of minutes. You can not just set a domesticated animal free.  Get her a big big cage she will be happy.|`|iHkbrJF1aa	Theres nowhere safe outside as there are many animal predators about. Your hamster would not survive for any length of time. Why don't you try to handle your hamster more often and spend time playing with it, that way it will know you are not a threat and may calm down.|`|892YhtPCaa	i think they originated in syria, they would last five minutes in the wild, try and make it happy with good food and clean cage,  please dont kick it out,  dwarfs are not that friendly,  trying to escape? do you mean it nibbles the cage bars? if so that keeps their teeth short which is natural.  just love the little rodent for what it is  xxx|`|f633886f4ab9993e966868c8e49ab87baa	Just buy a hamster playpen, or if you want to go even bigger, buy her a toddler (human toddler) playpen and let it run in there. Don't release it into the wild.|`|xtRm5NV5aa	Seriously?|`|S3eJJu7haa	Nooo! dont let it go a cat can smell the hamster and eat it!!!   PLease dont go return it back to the petstore!  the poor thing wouldnt want to be let out into the front yard... go  take it back to petstore!  please  thanks|`|eL5tsepwaa	Are you seriously asking where you should release your tiny non-native dwarf hamster out into the wild??  Thats cruelty! I'm sorry to be harsh but its true, please please don't just put her out into the wild! She will have very little idea of how to fend for itself and she will be eaten, or will starve.  If you aren't willing to give the time and attention that an animal needs in order to for it learn to trust you then I suggest you give your hamster to a caring person, or take her to an animal shelter.  But really, if you give her some time and patience hamsters can be lovely pets!! Just start gradually by being near the cage a lot, giving food gently etc, and build up to touching her and lifting her out of the cage.  Whatever you do, if you set her free she will die and please consider that.|`|VRMIwqQFaa	give it to the animal shelter|`|aqY13vWNaa	I don't think she wants to be free, just more time out of the cage. Buy her a plastic ball for her to play in before you let her go, would you want to be jammed into a cage all day? Hope this helps!|`|40f227229c7ab577dbd51416ad7993e9aa	Well, what you could do is NOT to set it in the wild! you can just take her out of her cage and play with her in the bathtub! hope it helped!|`|94to8aeMaa	Once an animal is domesticated and has lived in doors you cannot let it be free in the wild or even in your back yard because it is then open to disease and also will be eaten by a cat or dog. or a person may try to kill it because its a rodent. so if you really need to get rid of it talk to a friend maybe they will want him or give him to the rspca or spca depending on were you live.    signed: Amelia inspectorate of the RSPCA|`|JNGYZQvbaa	Domestic hamsters are way different from wild hamsters. they will not survive because they never actually had to find food and shelter. Take it to a pet store or animal shelter.|`|KAimfROfaa	You can't release your hamster in the wild. no no no that would be a dissaster. If you don't want it, give it to someone who does. If you mean where can I let it run around, get a playpen, or watch her while she is running in a baby proofed room.|`|MU7q5fCRaa	Don't abandon or let your hamster set free into the wild.    Alot of hamsters are like that. If you got them at first. They may believe your trying to eat them if you JUST got them. So, try learning to get her used to you.|`|rglJI1q3aa	set it free and next thing you'll know, a snake jumps out and swallows it.    DO NOT set it free. sell it back to the pet store, give it to someone else or other stuff.    but DON'T free it.|`|vHwYENVjaa	Take her to a vet and say you can't care for it anymore, or take it to a petstore or SPCA.      BUT DO NOT RELEASE IT.  Do you realize you bought a PET, an animal that was bred in captivity from parents who were bred in captivity? The hamster WONT survive in the wild because it DOESN'T KNOW HOW.    You bought a HAMSTER, you can't expect a dog out of them... so maybe you should get another pet, or better yet, wait until you mature a bit.|`|ak9DrBSwaa	You can't set her free. She'd starve or be killed by a predator. You should also NEVER release a non-native species as it can have severe consequences on local wildlife if it managed to establish a breeding colony.    You CAN advertise your unwanted pet on places like Craigslist.com, freecycle or your local classifieds to try and find it a home. You may even have a friend who would like a pet (be sure they have thier parents ok!) and has the time and patience to tame her.    The next best option would be to surrender her to an animal rescue center. Some pet stores and vets may even take her.|`|ddgTC9BZaa	once you buy a pet it means that you have commited to look after it for the rest of their lifes!!! i dont beleive some people!|`|G3Xf0i0Eaa	Dwarf hamsters really arn't the best for being handled - and ALL pets will try escape to explore or get somewhere safe to them.    Dont let her out if you really can't handle her - thats like leaving a new born baby out in the wild!!!    Put an add in a shop window or something, or take her to rescue centre or see if a pet shop will take her back? Even better, offer her to a friend so you know they'll take care of her and you can just pop over to say hi without having to have the responsibility and commitment of having your own.    Please please please before you go get another pet, read and learn more about them! You bought a type of hamster that is renowned for not being easy to handle, so obviously didnt do your homework.|`|1XdzYYvUaa	You would put a hamster into the wild because it doesn't like to be handled and it tries to escape?  Did you not think through things like this before buying the hamster?     It wouldn't last 2 minutes out in the wild, it's a small helpless little pet...    But if you really want to get rid of it, advertise it in a newspaper, or ask your friends if they want it, or give it back to the pet shop...    Or if you want to keep it, buy it a big cage and lots of things to do, wheel, tunnels, woodshavings to dig into, etc.  And about the handling, it takes time... My hamster is almost 1 year old and he's not keen on being handled.|`|QEiv4LcAaa	What! you can't just let her go, regardless of where you do. Give it to someone that actually has the patience to look after her. You can't just set her free, it's a domestic animal and needs to be kept inside because they will die so quickly.  Please don't just let it go, she'll die and cats and other animals will try to kill her so she'll be so stressed that she'll have a heart attack and suffer, badly.   Take her back to the shop if you really don't care that much about her. You should have thought about that before you bought her.  Don't let her go.|`|J8T0UOyOaa	Dwarf hamsters bite alot, just try keeping her occupied, put some shredding paper and toilet role tubes in her cage, something to chew, and scrunch paper into a ball and let her play with it, Get a large storage box and set it up with lots of toys for her, Whatever you do dont let her out into the wild, she will die from cold and probably eaten, Just take her to a rescue home or give her away,|`|ZCBotgcIaa	Try to put her in a little ball, and let her run around in it on the grass, as the ball is clear, she can see the grass, and it feels realistic.|`|dy33mUSYaa	shes tired of being coped up let her run aruond the house and dont smother her so much
AzeOk29saa	For my cats at least, worse things go through their system than earphones.  As long as your cat didn't choke on the earphones when they went down, she should be fine.
qAwnAYGAaa	Your fish are getting used to sharing their home.  Remember that before the new fish that little guy had the whole tank to himself.  He just wasn't used to somebody else in his "home".|`|PlBHhU3Kaa	well they are ok with each other the reason why your fish became so active is because it finally got used to the water|`|Hxa0lXb3aa	Its way way too small. (not way way but its small)  Goldfish poop a lot causing a lot of ammonia nitrite and nitrate. They should be fine for a month or so then they need bigger tanks. The common needs atleast 25 gallons. The telescope needs atleast 20 gallons. Please research before you buy fish. They won't grow more then their tank size cause most are stunted (Body stops growing but the organs do) ITs painful for them. Torturing them a long painful death. Your fish weren't moving because they are in shock. Did you float the bag before you put them in?   Good luck|`|bDPVRtCNaa	Your tank is severely overstocked.    The only reason for a fish to stop growing is poor living conditions. No fish grows to fit the size of their environment. They will stunt because of terrible water quality and lack of space. Stunting is when the body stops growing but the organs continue. It leads to poor quality of life, and a shortened lifespan. Goldfish should live at least 15-20 years.    ~A single fancy goldfish requires 20 gallons and will grow 6-8 inches long.  ~A single common goldfish needs 55 gallons, and should grow at least one foot long.  ~Common goldfish and fancy goldfish should not be housed together.    You should find the common goldfish a pond, and buy the fancy goldfish at least a 20 gallon aquarium.|`|9759e8014743debd3d3fd1a7ad437c1faa	The "fish professionalist" doesn't know what the **** he's talking about.  Goldfish get to be about a foot long (occasionally bigger) and live for 20 to 40 years. For two goldfish, you need at least a 30-gallon tank. If you stunt them by keeping them in an undersized tank (or, worse, a fish bowl), they won't stay small, except that they'll die after a relatively short time, and fish don't grow when they're dead.    Two goldfish can usually live peacefully in the same tank, although they may chase and nip at each other a little bit.    Your new fish didn't move much at first because it was disoriented and scared by the new tank, but it becomes more active as it gets used to its surroundings.
AA11065140	Start by unplugging it for a while.  The cat is still adjusting to being in a new house, with new people, which is a big change.  Let him get used to the new environment, and the location of his litter box, without having to fear the moving parts.      Once he's all settled, and is using the box regularly, re-introduce the concept of moving parts. It might still scare him a bit, so be prepared to go slow.  But he's much more likely to take to it, if you can give him the chance to learn that that's his spot.|`|D1FlyZrcaa	some cats are very picky. if he is afraid of it there isnt much you can do about it. i have a cat that doesnt like to use a litter box that is dirty. even if it isnt that bad to my standard if she thinks it is she will poop on the floor instead. the only way to stop it is to clean it. i'm sorry to say it but cats are very stubborn and i would return your litter maid and just suck it up and get a regular one and clean it your self.|`|XQ5JjMs6aa	Its really hard to get them unafraid of something. Best bet would be to put it up on e-bay or Craigslist. At least get some money out of it. We used to have one and it stopped working. Its alot of money for something you could take 5 min out of your day to do. You could spend the money somewhere else. Hope this helps. =]|`|cNjtT4Hyaa	Try turning it off until kitty gets used to it. then the urge to use the bathroom should overcome the fear!|`|WLOYtPA1aa	well yes it probably is afraid of it.  Cats don't like loud noise or they never heard of it, they like soft quiet noise.   Well dont know how you will return it, try to get a big litter box. And doesn't do any wierd noise.|`|OjXvYEZDaa	it must be sounds of "self cleaning" that scares cat off or were you changing different brand of litter base? I use standard littertray and i clean it regularly even scooped everytime my kitten does a waste in. my kitten isn't afraid of it she is litter trainned|`|U2KdP1y7aa	Cats don't like these machines because they don't understand them and they make noise. I bought one too and my cat would not use it. Took it back to the store for a refund. You are just going to have to clean the litter box yourself.|`|RAtgv9GHaa	I know this will make you mad but:  i think you should bring it back to the store,and scoop yourself.  My kittie,(well next doors) that stayed at our house,got hit by a car and died today.  I miss him very much.|`|yCR6qg0baa	Those don't work very well. A lot of the time, the cat's terds are so small that they fall between the spaces in the scraper thing. Then you have to go back & clean up after your fancy litter box. If you bought it at Petsmart, they have a 100% money back guarantee. If you bought it elsewhere, dump all the litter out, put it back in the box, and take it back. Go get something else your cat can pee in for the meantime without scaring it.|`|cii9XShcaa	You should probably purchase a regular litter box and scoop and set it up right next to the Littermaid. Whenever you're around and the cat goes to the regular box to do it's business, after the cat finishes, you should immediately turn the Littermaid on to run so the cat gets use to the sound it makes as soon as he/she steps out of the box. Once you've noticed your cat doesn't run or panic everytime it runs, then you should take away the regular box, then put the cat into the Littermaid and run its paws through the litter. Keep trying until you've had success. I've never had a Littermaid so I'm not sure if there is a button/switch to make it run manually. This just sounds like a good idea to have the cat become use to the sound.|`|57Efw8LRaa	That's a simple fix get the old style litter box and scooper combo because your cat doesn't like it. What matters most is if you love your cat than you would use the old style because unless under certain circumstances you are gone for really long periods of time or have certain limitations, your cat should have it's way in this type of situation.|`|KLMo9jbzaa	Take it back get your refund and don't be lazy and scoop it yourself.|`|PUlQXDAyaa	first i would just like to say that it was a bit silly to pay $90 for a litter box but i do understand   im not quite sure what it looks like but i think it might be because it goes over its head if it is a kitten then just keep putting her in it and she should get used to it same if it is a cat xx hope this helps xxx
giWvSwqRaa	Change water once a month but only partial change.|`|Iw6vqJd8aa	After getting a filter, I wold get a tank vacuum to get the nasty stuff off the bottom. The "spots" are algae and bacteria. You need to clean your tank, every week or two. It will keep your water chemistry better and your fish wont be stressed.|`|Hxa0lXb3aa	The "stuff" is algae.    Since you had it for about 1 1/2- 2 years the tank probably cyceld itself. You should really buy a filter. It helps with bad stuff and it creates a disturbense in the water causeing more air for the fish. and you should really get water testers for ammonia, nitrite, nitrate, ph, kh, and hardness. air pump would be optional because the goldfish would be gulpign in teh air if you don't have one. you should change the water   every week or so. Also the comets get bigger than a foot long and they should be in ponds. You are stunting their growth causeing a slow painful death. sorry for the info but its true    good luck~|`|IBrWDf5baa	Woah. You totally need a filter!! Comets don't last very long, and by not cleaning the tank, you are making it even shorter!    I suggest buying a good filter, and installing it. That yucky green/brown/yellow muck is bacteria created by the fish or alge. Its very hard to clean out manually, and should be cleaned by a filter.    A tank without a filter should be cleaned for about every 1-2 weeks, or if the water starts to turn yellowish or yucky looking. To prevent the water in the tank to cloud, I suggest buying Fish Food that does not cloud, and does not dirty the water.    All in all I hope you buy a filter for your fish! They need a clean lifestyle in that tank! Good luck!|`|CDVWnF7Laa	Goldfish are the hardiest of fish, but if algae is accumulating that quickly then you do need to get a filter. You can buy a gravel-vaccuumer for about 3 dollars and not have to change the water completely for about a month.     there is also a fish called plescostmus, and they feed on algae and they get along great with any fish, but they also poop alot which could effect the ammonia level in your tank.    I would reccomend just buying a filter and gravel vaccumer, and vaccuum the gravel about once a week, taking out about a gallon and replacing it with clean water.     Good luck, and make sure to keep your tank clean, because it could hurt your fish in the long run.|`|dB3Gu0Ypaa	buy a bigger tank and filter now that is cruel and get all of the poop out !!! now you are very cruel to your fish!!!!
743068a4754f2f76d1f527b5e8c886cdaa	Your cat is definitely showing her displeasure when she hits people with her tail,she considers the bed her own. Try getting her her own bed a clean blankit in a big enough basket. If she won't accept this have people who are on your bed pet her and then gently move her.|`|SMFhXxcfaa	cats have full control over their tail.  kick her off the bed.|`|CwNMq7RTaa	They do not consciously control the movement of the tail.  It's an automatic reaction to stress or displeasure.  It's like if you stiffen up when you see someone you don't like.  She's not doing it.  It just happens.  Something in the sleeping arrangment is making her anxious.  She might even be happier if she had her own bed.|`|6eIBIOwoaa	Lol. Shes just excited!!!|`|0d9a6DQvaa	Lol they can control it :P,    My cat does it all the time, she does it usually when she's uncomfortable or happy/excited.|`|c09015d055d4ed9fd5940c775d1850a4aa	Cats usually twitch their tails when they are mad. Maybe you are bumping into her or rolling over on her and she gets made and starts throwing her tail around in anger or displeasure.|`|NJfpY7nIaa	Lol.  Try getting her a cat bed and putting it on the floor next to the bed. Then put her in it when she starts tail slapping.
yQIOXv5Yaa	rabbits are good, but they require enough care that you would have to talk her first about it. otherwise a mouse/hamster/ect.. would be good. they are cute and much easier to tame and take care of.     although since rabbits do require more care and have more personaliy they would solve the problem a little better.     maybe you could find some little kids for her to babysit. depending on her pesonality that might make her feel needed plus it can be very fun.     good luck!|`|6eIBIOwoaa	Bunny Rabbit... :D|`|VMIkIv26aa	you should get a rabbit or a bird.|`|yTD84yFlaa	Hmm; when it comes to animals like that, dogs and cats are gonna be tops.    You can always try a hamster or ferret if she is interested in those kinds of animals.  However I would suggest, if possible, talk to the mom about a kitten, get the kitten declawed as long as he/she is staying inside and things shouldn't be too bad.    I got a kitten from someone outside a Stater Bros and he's the BEST animal I have owned thus far.|`|tT256JQRaa	bearded dragon.  they are so friendly and gentle.  you can hold it all day and it'll just sit there.  they are beautiful.    make sure she wants and can take care of a pet though first. work it into a converation subtly with her...   and ask the parents if they willlet her have one first.    a chinchilla?  they are fluffy, cuddly, fun and cute.|`|J7ByVZ3Aaa	Don't get her a pet if she doesn't feel needed. Giving pets as unexpected gifts is a bad idea.|`|UIkzfWY6aa	a birdy !  or a hedgehog, they're really easy to take care of, but she wouldnt exactly be able to cuddle it..|`|VQzYYYaEaa	A bunny rabbit is a cute little pet to hold, but they do poop a lot. =/  Guinea pigs are good to hold in your hands and carry with you around the house.  DON'T GET:  a mouse  a parakeet  a lizard
eX8i4vwRaa	oh my gosh, two weeks!?  i doubt she'd be alive for two weeks in the shed with no air, food or water.  she probably escaped and was around the neighborhood then just recently went in there.  but if my cat was stuck in there, id definitely go over and get her.  just do it at night or something.  you could always give the neighbors a call if you have their   [cell im guessing]  but yeah.. you dont know if shes been eating and very well could die.  so i would kinda hurry.|`|6eIBIOwoaa	Have you been feeding and watering the cat? You could always call the local PD and they could give you some help. Maybe they would get her out for you......|`|0d9a6DQvaa	It's your cat! If you love it go get it!    If not you should be the one in the shed.|`|CwNMq7RTaa	Call the police and then call the local animal shelter.  And see what they both say.  I'm sure that you are not required legally to let her starve to death.  I'm sure between those two agencies, you'll come up with something.|`|MlRbOB2Maa	um get the poor thing out. call the PD or something i hope u have been feeding and watering the dam thing. how did it get in there in the first place. find out and then get it out the same way! or just brake the padlock and buy them a new one!!!!!!!! hope this helps|`|yQIOXv5Yaa	Is there anyway you could get their phone number? And how did she get in a padlocked shed in the first place? Are you absolutely sure that she's still in there? if she wasn't locked in their then there is probably a way out and starvation is enough motivation for her to work very hard to get out.      if you're a kid, have you talked to your parents?     If you must break in, then i would buy them a new padlock that i would put on once you get her out. then i would make sure that you talk to them as soon once they get home.|`|qPwKSysbaa	It seems like if she got in she should be able to get out but then again I dont know|`|F0d2W9Zyaa	1. call the police or the ascpca if you have one near you. tell them the story and they will send some officers to help you. have a good story or they can arrest you for animal abuse.    2. unless you have lockpicks take a crowbar and break the lock off. a hammer can work too if the lock is rusty or just plain crappy.    I suggest 1|`|6be65543422b4937c27d1761a2ed50a0aa	Call your local police department, explain the situation, tell them how long the cat's been locked inside, that you'll buy a padlock for the door, and ....."will they PLEASE come open the shed so you can get your cat out?"    Since they'll be there to open and re-lock the door, you shouldn't have a problem with the neighbors.  Doesn't anyone in your neighborhood know how to reach these people?  Does anyone know how long they planned on being gone?    CALL THE POLICE...........HOPEFULLY, they'll help!!  Good luck.|`|i4ceTwqLaa	She's alive???!!!    Cut the lock. Get her out.|`|RN1wGlWWaa	Is there any way you can contact the neighbors?  Are you SURE your cat is in there?  If so, he probably will not survive very much longer.  How did he get inside the locked shed?    You might contact your police department and see what they can do to help you out.  If he's not out very soon, he may not survive.|`|UtYOwE4Laa	break the lock your cat might be dead i'm sure they'd understand you're trying to save a life!!!!!!|`|3lEMNFFzaa	Does the shed have a dirt floor or cement?  If it is dirt-- grab a shovel and dig out a hole beside/ against and under the shed to allow her to come out-- you may need to lure her with food.  And like the other person said-- if that is impossible, contact the animal control or police service in your town for assistance.|`|4TX26viFaa	A call to both the Police AND the animal control or animal shelter in your area is required. The police can break in for you. The fact it's your pets inside gives you the ok to ask them to do this.    I would not have waited 2 weeks.
ta3wiCvtaa	You can't make your rat do anything. If she doesn't want to run in it then you can't force her to, and don't push the ball while she's in it. Usually rats don't like those balls as they're too smart for them.|`|HWoLbR7Aaa	Rats are too smart for that crap. If you want her to exercise, find a large space she can't escape from (I like to use my bed) and get her to chase your hand around and wrestle with it.|`|LNnRSLdtaa	you cant   shes not an object and you shouldnt put her in a ball   they hurt there backs, vets wil advise you not to.     dont push it   thats just curel     my advice is stop puting her in the ball. shes obviously terrified of it.|`|nzCxfFNyaa	put cheese in the place u wnt it to go lol uhhh or jus leave her in der mayb she dnt kno dha prosses|`|f633886f4ab9993e966868c8e49ab87baa	rats don't run in hamster wheels or in plastic balls, they are more intelligent and can see that they won't be able to escape the ball without your help, so it has no reason to run in it. The reason that hamsters run in balls s because they think they can escape. Just be proud that your rat is smart.|`|nmzpdvkqaa	you buy a snake put them two in a box she will try to run away but....i think you know the rest
ta3wiCvtaa	No, they don't need one. There are actually many of them who don't like them. If you do decide to get one, make sure it's a solid one and not one of the wire ones. They need a large cage and excerise out of their cage for at least an hour each day. With being outside of the cage and not giving them any "junk" food they should stay a healthy weight. I have never given any of my rats a wheel and they are perfectly healthy.|`|mTJ8wTs3aa	I would make sure to have a wheel. It's not totally necessary if you take your rat out to exercise it a lot, but it's good to have it there as a choice for the rat. It shouldn't really get fat if you make sure to feed it healthy food and take it out to exercise often, but I would still recommend a wheel.|`|lLQunBRaaa	you do not need a wheel they most likely will not use it. and no they won't get fat.
SMFhXxcfaa	keep an eye on it and see if he vomits again. I have a dog that vomits bile if she gets really excited.  Its possible that he had a tickle in this throat or he ate something that unfortunately didn't come up when he vomited.  was the oink noise the "heaving" one of my dogs heave before they vomit, which is a nice warning so I can grab a garbage can or get him outside.  As for the cough, my first guess is kennel cough.  If you are really worried take him to the vet to make sure he is ok.|`|krkpHSOhaa	Well one he can't be Pregnant because hes a HE!  If i were you take him to the vet to make sure hes o.k.  Is he coughing or hacking, if so he might have ate some he wasn't supposed to.|`|16XpYCBmaa	If he is making odd noises and coughing that could be kennel cough. And if he keeps throwing up he is defiantly sick. I would take him or either call the vet and get him checked out. Sometimes my dog throws up over the littlest thing like if she takes a big drink of water she will throw up.

It might be a hairball sort of thing. If it continues after a half hour or so. Call your vet. He may just have something he needs to cough up. after all, people dont go calling the doctor every time we cough. : )|`|HGb4Nvhfaa	I am thinking mabey you should get him checked out 4 kennel cough|`|WlFxAna8aa	He most likely would have just eaten something dodgy, maybe grass, teabags or just rotten food. if it gets more serious, i;e continues, more of it, starts walking or breathing funny, then take him to the vet.|`|c09015d055d4ed9fd5940c775d1850a4aa	The coughing could mean kennel cough. Google it for more  symptoms and take him to the vet if necessary.|`|qPmPAhiwaa	something is blocking his intestine.    could be something he ate or a cyst / tumor.    hopefully it is just something he ate. Remember the same thing happens in humans. In the end its best to have him checked out at the vet..    Better to know the right answer then to be worried and questioning|`|rlkgpEQOaa	Get to the vet as soon as possible because your dog may have a bad disease...or maybe she is pregnant...wait it is a girl right? Anyways has it gotten it's shots?. My request is to take him/her to the vet and make sure it's ok.>>>>> :( and i m sorry about your dog.|`|XdjpnzO7aa	normally dogs make that sound before vomiting because  they are actually trying to vomit. Usually this happens less than 1 hour after their meal. It could be something stuck in its throat or something it could not digest properly.   You dont need to worry but if the vomiting repeats in following 24 hrs then u can be willing to spend some time at the veterinarian|`|GNtsdk4saa	The "oinking" noise is just him trying to bring up the junk in his tummy.  Is there a chance he has swallowed something he shouldn't?  Is he dehydrated?  Look at his gums and press on them with your finger,  The pink should come back immediately.  If there are ANY other symptoms or if you answered yes to either of the firs two questions, you should go see the vet first thing tomorrow.  Find an emergency vet tonight if he gets significantly worse.|`|SF5WnQFQaa	I HAVE NO IDEA!!! TAKE HIM TO A VET NOW!!!!!!

sXZWQRGdaa	It is either an immature or a female.      Mature male chilean roses have tibial hooks, which look little projections off the tibia of the front two legs that are used to restrain the female during copulation.  These hooks are only visible once the male has reached maturity, and usually won't live longer than a year after that.  However, chilean rose males can beat that by living up to 3.  Also mature male tarantulas will have "clubbed" pedipalps.  The pedipalps in males doubles as secondary sex organs, soaking in sperm deposited on a sperm web so they can inject it into a female during copulation.    If it molts, you can verify if it's male or female by looking on the inside of the abdomen between the first pair of book lungs.  There is a small slit there visible on both the outside and the inside called the epigastric furrow.  This is the reproductive organ of the spider.  Females will have a little tab sticking out of the inside of the slit pointing backwards toward the spinnerets.|`|KeevlZnTaa	It is hard to tell the difference between a male and female. One option is to wait until the molt and then send it to an experienced breeder/keeper to be examined. There are a few places that will look at the molt and can tell you the sex.    This place offers free sexing if you send them the molt.  http://www.swiftinverts.com/|`|dykhWhMxaa	EWWWWWWW! How the heck could you have a TARANTULA!!!!!!?
G0KKfXMUaa	Well, they're not going to say, "NO" because you aren't consistent.<br>  <br>  But it is best to have an almost "perfect" video... especially if it's a higher college.<br>  <br>  One of my equestrian friends, who did not have that great of academic grades, sent a video of her jumping 4 foot on my old trainer's horse. She was participating in a show. They ended up winning. Her position was practically perfect, and the horse was BEAUTIFUL (he was a dark brown Hanoveriann... absolutely gorgeous).<br>  <br>  So even though she wasn't doing so hot in school, she still got in because of the video.<br>  <br>  Basically, even though it takes a lot of effort, try to get the best video possible on the best horse you're able to ride.<br>  <br>  And the more horses you ride and the more videos, the better the chance.<br>  <br>  Oh, and good luck =)<br>  <br>  Also, if you have to send in an essay and aren't given a topic, try to explain to them how you are a really hard worker when it comes to your horses.|`|TSc8OE4vaa	Hopefully, but it really depends on the college.  Some will take just about anyone because they need more people on the team, some are a lot pickier.  Maybe if you are a good rider but have trouble with a few things they'll take you and put you in the novice section.|`|WHHuXtb3aa	Well I couldn't really tell you what colleges are looking for, but to fix your leg you could try tying your stirrups to your girth with bailing twine or something. It worked really well with fixing my leg. If your leg problem is fixed I don't see a problem with you making the team!|`|tWTJ4CSIaa	I know that college teams want to see you riding on many different horses.  You can't change your position at the moment, but your best chance at getting on the team is to show that you can ride weel on a variety of horses/ponies.  You need to ride at least 3 or 4 horses in the video.   You should also have your show clothes on.  <br>  <br>  To directly answer your question, it depends.  If you are applying for a small school riding team then I think they would be happy to have someone who does all the things you mentioned.  At big places, like Auburn (I met and chatted with the girls from their team #1 in the nation) they need to KNOW that you are the best out there and you would need excelent consistant equitation to be recruited.  <br>  <br>  Those are my personal tips, GOOD LUCK!
743068a4754f2f76d1f527b5e8c886cdaa	You are responsible for feeding her. She is probably not attacking you but it is her plea to be fed. Try dry food and fill her bowl daily,she will eat what she needs,the same goes for water. If you have been feeding her wet food it is a different story. Feed her what you think she requires and then carry a rolled up newspaper and swat area around her when she attacks you. My cat has a thing where she wants her dry food bowl filled to the brim everyday or she attacks my legs and I can't ignore that plea.|`|iZ2J85Hpaa	Is she neutered. If she's not, all the hormones in her body could be causing her to do this to you imparticular.   Also, be ready with a bottle of water and squirt it at her every time she goes to do it, or just throw water on her. That will get her to think about what she's doing and get her to stop.   Honestly, my 7 month old kitten used to do that and after he was neutered he was a lot better, as all he does now is chew my hand.     I hope I helped in some way.|`|gmh1PN5qaa	Maybe she don"t like the way that you are.Ohh maybe she don"t like how you smell or she don" t like you.|`|R3iuuwBgaa	Sounds to me like she's playing with you because she loves you. This is how cats play. She doesn't know she's hurting you. Wear shoes or slippers and try to remember that she has chosen you as playmate over the rest of your family.|`|x0WZE0i4aa	I agree she's probably being playful and/or trying to get your attention because she wants something like food.  I have a 'client' does this: She usually gives some warning, and I can make a claw with my hand and hiss at her to tell her no, which saves some damage!  Don't know if that would help with yours!  If you are scaring her, doing this calmly might be better than screaming or shouting at her!    I guess you might also discuss someone else doing the feeding for a while!|`|BKZO8E0waa	We have a cat and sometimes (not often though and usually at night) he jumps on my legs (or someone else's in the family) and starts biting and and scratching though he is only playing. He does it for only a short time and becomes normal again. It hurts, but it's funny, though I don't know why she only does it to you? Does she let you pat her at all? When she jumps on your legs, pull them away, clap your hands and yell "NO" and wait until she stops. I don't know if this will work on your cat but it does on mine. Blowing on her may also help.|`|eDKWcEjYaa	I don't know why your cat is doing that but here are some things that would help her not hurt you!  1.) when you walk by the spot where she always attacks you, use a piece of string or a toy to distract her from you legs  2.) buy some treats and feed them to her every time she comes to you and lets you pet her  3.) spend at least 10 minutes playing w/ her and letting her know you love her    Hope this helps!|`|WLOYtPA1aa	well to me is your cat is playful, if you want her to be lovely then catch her and hold her and pet her. Easy as simple.  I did that all the time. lol.
K0uTjeWiaa	It is pretty ,much all marketing. kitten food is not much different if different at all from other bands. Please learn about what cats need to be healthy        Nutrition since there are so many bad things out there is very important to your cats health  Contrary to what you may have heard; dry foods are not a great thing to feed a cat.   Please read the label on what you are feeding? What are the ingredients? Do you know what they mean? Is the first ingrediant a muscle meat like chicken or meal or other things?  http://www.catinfo.org/ Learn_How_To_Rea...  http://iml.jou.ufl.edu/projects/Spring04...  Dry foods are the number 1 cause of diabetes in cats as well as being a huge contributing factor to kidney disease, obesity, crystals, u.t.is and a host of other problems. Food allergies are very common when feeding dry foods. Rashes, scabs behind the tail and on the chin are all symptoms  The problems associated with Dry food is that they are loaded with grains and carbohydrates which many cats (carnivores) cannot process.  Also, Most of the moisture a cat needs is suppose to be in the food but in  Dry, 95% of it is zapped out of dry foods in the processing. Another thing, most use horrible ingredients and don't use a muscle meat as the primary ingredient and use vegetable based protein versus animal. Not good for an animal that has to eat meat to survive.  http://www.catinfo.org/ My_Cat_is_Doing_...  You want to pick a canned food w/o gravy (gravy=carbs) that uses a muscle meat as the first ingredient and doesn't have corn at least in the first 3 ingredients if at all.      THE  BEST CAT FOODS CONTAIN NO GRAINS NO BYPOODUCTS NO MEAL  Cats are meat eaters not cereal or rice eaters   Fancy feast is a middle grade food with 9lives, friskies  whiskas lower grade canned and wellness and merrick upper grade human quality foods. I would rather feed a middle grade canned food then the top of the line dry food.   Also, dry food is not proven to be better for teeth. Does a hard pretzel clean your teeth or do pieces of it get stuck? http://www.felinefuture.com/nutrition/bp...     Please read about cat nutrition.   http://www.catinfo.org/                                   http://www.catinfo.org/feline_obesity.ht...        http://maxshouse.com/feline_nutrition.ht...     Vetinarian diets  The reason your vet thinks so highly of the pet food they sell probably has more to do with money than nutrition. In vet school, the only classes offered on nutrition usually last a few weeks, and are taught by representatives from the pet food companies. Vet students may also receive free food for their own dogs and cats at home. They could get an Iams notebook, a Purina purse and some free pizza.  http://iml.jou.ufl.edu/projects/Spring04...|`|Uc96X3T3aa	The hard cat food bags should specify age or say for cats and kittens if for both. Ask the clerk for more details.Do not forget the soft food. Mix a little out of the can with H20 and save the rest for tommorrow. One 5 ounce can with a little water mixed feeds my 3 cats. They LOVE it! Do not forget to bang the top of the can with a fork before opening and say "kitty kitty hungry"?|`|1d8661eb6ce2c98647549229b811855aaa	You just buy the kitten version.  Looking at the ingredients and make sure  that the first one on the list is not..corn/  corn by products...  That means, that there is no meat in it just  plain..corn..Not good.|`|AA11171398	I personally wouldn't recommend going to petsmart period. Foods like science diet, iams, purina, etc are foods every dog and cat should stay away from. My kitten is on a diet made by Natures Variety (http://www.naturesvariety.com/). They offer great natural diets for cats.    Average pet stores offer foods high in sugar and starch, and their proteins (such as chicken, turkey, lamb, etc) are not the best of quality to put it nicely. Cats who spend a lifetime on iams are usually the ones who end up picking through the garbage after eating, having digestive problems, and having poor skin and coat.    The difference between kitten foods, adult foods, and senior foods mainly are the amount of proteins and carbs in the food. Those that don't vary at all, or say the difference in age, usually mean all life stages. Only some foods offer all life stages- generally a cat doesn't need a kitten formula, however you don't want your kitten to become a chunky monkey no matter how adorable. Regular exercise is very important if you wish to be on a all life stages food!|`|BKZO8E0waa	Try feeding is Friskers or Whiskers. That's what I feed my cat and he's very healthy. They also have kitten, adult, senior.

It's stomach cannot make the right enzymes for a change in diet very quickly. canned dog food is made up of 90% water in many cases. If you are trying to give your dog a little bit more help with dried food add a little fresh chicken or warm water to the kibble.  Cesar is unnecessary especially if you buy a good dried dog food like Eukanuba or Science plan.|`|FuSmPGL3aa	definately, more so when I feed him dry cats hair.

She handles them just fine and she is the only one taking care of all the pets!|`|NFRr2uKqaa	personally, the more animals the better...but...when you must answer to parents, then the rules are different...especially when they are the ones paying the bills. if you were the one shelling out the money for the ferrets, and for all the things that the ferrets needed, including having the money on hand for any possible vet trips...then i can't see why you shouldn't have the two ferrets, assuming you have plenty of room at your home, and as you say, plenty of people to willingly and responsibly look after all the animals.    however, times are very hard right now. i know that at our local humane shelter, a great many pets are being dropped off...because people can no longer afford to keep them. if this is not the case for your parents and you can talk them into getting you the ferrets, please consider going to the humane shelter near you and rescuing an abandoned ferret or two there.
qR3MYSOIaa	It depends a lot on the breed of cat.  Here's a good article on how to tell if your cat is overweight... http://www.catsplay.com/thedailycat/2002...    For the record, I have two cats who both 9 years old.  One of them weighs 16 lbs and is the perfect weight for his build and breed, mixed with maine coon.  My other cat is 14 lbs and she is overweight, but not by much.  She's at her best when she's 12 lbs, but I can't get the Tubby off the couch most of the day, she tries to bite me when I do, lol.|`|AA11171398	Because of the different breeds and such, their really isn't a guideline to as far as "how much should my cat weigh". This is going to sound stupid, but does your cat look fat?    If if he/she is a large cat, as in has a heavy build, and weighs 16lbs, then no, he is not overweight. There are just some large cats out there. But if he/she is a tiny kitty who looks like she has swallowed a bowling ball, then yes, she/he is overweight.    You can try this 9 point scoring system used by many vets. http://www.peteducation.com/article.cfm?...|`|tbwfSPI7aa	Okay well a healthy cat weighsfrom 8 -10pounds. Glad to help!!!|`|TerNxuI7aa	I'm not sure but I heard from our vet that if you can't feel a cat's ribs easily through it's coat then it's overweight. That's kind of a weird guideline though.|`|X40Ww89qaa	dunno when i pick him up i can't see the numbers on the scale
z01moLIvaa	You actually shouldn't be giving your rats cat or dog food for extra protein unless they're pregnant because that's the only time when they really need it. They're daily food that you give them already contains the amount of protein that they need so you don't worry. Too much protein can actually cause hair loss in your rats. A few pieces of the cat food every now and then should be ok though|`|DufvgxE6aa	I used to mix dog food and lab block for rat food. You can buy 25 lb bags of lab block at feed store. I would not use cat food the protein is a bit high for rats might cause health problems.|`|yQIOXv5Yaa	probably, i'd check the ingridients and if they are similar probably.
PUbR3tHKaa	It could be an allergy, or a mark from barbering/over grooming, it could also be a scab from mites.  If it is around her shoulder blades where it is hard for her to reach, and if it kinda looks like she's been fighting even if she's alone, it is probably mites.  Most rat keepers see them at least once.  They don't mean that your cages aren't clean, they just mean that something brought one in!  Talk to your vet about it.  They can tell you what it is for sure.|`|6W4ZWOetaa	Sometimes rats get these scabs from eating too much protein, but yes the first answer could also be right.  It could be mites.
LAXxaxAZaa	The pommel shouldn't hurt you because you should be in the same position as you are with stirrups. All I can say is practice. You have to build up muscles you aren't used to using that vigorously.      EDIT--- then you need to figure out why you're in a different position. Are you sitting further forward on the saddle? Maybe try trotting with stirrups and drop them while you're still trotting. Then you might stay in the same position.|`|xdyM3IVmaa	You need to do a LOT more stirrup-less work. The reason it was... hurting so much was that you weren't using your legs at all... you were just letting yourself bounce around. You really need strength in your inner thighs, calves... everywhere. You should be posting just as easily as you would with stirrups. Obviously, you rely on them far too much.     As for tips... go w/o stirrups for a couple of weeks. Move WITH the horse's movement, and use your legs to keep you in position as you rise and fall with the horse. It takes time... muscles have to be built.|`|XL62syrCaa	Well my best bet is to do it with a saddle pad and surcingle or a bareback pad. Its going to hurt because you are using your thigh muscles more than they are used to. It will also improve your seat as you wont rely on your feet. The best way to improve working without stirrups is to keep on doing it. No pain no gain!|`|eRTwqowgaa	Practice, practice, practice! The more you do it, the more leg muscles you'll gain and the easier it will become! Grip with your thighs and imagine your leg ending at your knee..sounds silly but I've been told that alot and it does help! Other than that just try some leg strengthening excercises...my old trainer used to tell me to stand against a wall and bend your knees, like your sitting down...you'll really feel your muscles working in your legs. Also, if the saddle bothers you so much, practice bareback, you'll feel closer with your horse and you might find it easier to post without a saddle than just without stirrups.|`|RUxRNsf4aa	I think you are trying to say your "girl area" and really that shouldnt be hitting the pommel. It should be more in the middle of the saddle. If you are hitting the pommel there, you are probably leaning foward to relieve pain in your thigh area. Try to remember to stay sitting up and not leaning foward. Work on building your thighs so this problem doesnt occur.|`|eq5qPnRGaa	When you post, with or without stirrups, your seat should be coming forward and up in the saddle.  Where it starts and where it stops in each motion shouldn't change when you drop your stirrups.    You should still be maintaining the same hip, knee, and ankle angles as though you were still using your stirrups.  It is the bends there that allow you to remain balanced and to get up out of the saddle far enough to avoid hurting yourself.  It is nearly impossible to go up with your legs hanging straight down, so you'll only end up scooting back and forth in the saddle if you can't maintain a normal position without stirrups.    Maintaining that position and posting while maintaining it requires a great deal of strength.  If you haven't done a ton of work without stirrups, particularly posting and two point, it will make your legs hurt at first if you're doing it correctly.  But it should be muscles that hurt from the work that you are asking of them that they aren't strong enough to do.  If bone or joint pain (or anywhere else not muscle related) becomes an issue, pull up and ask your instructor for some help.  A good instructor will help you figure out why what you are doing hurts and how to fix it.  Riding may cause muscle fatigue but it shouldn't cause pain elsewhere.    While no stirrup work is a pain, literally, it will make you a better rider by reducing your reliance on your stirrups.  An experienced rider (who's done lots of no stirrup work among other things) has maybe a third of her weight in her stirrups, the rest is distributed along the inside of her legs from just below the knee up and her seat, though the exact points of contact will change depending on what she's doing at the moment.  In this state she's better balanced, quicker to adapt to changes in the horse's movement and easier for the horse to carry.  It also allows her legs to become more precise at giving aids because she can move them more freely without compromising her balance.|`|ECgFNEWjaa	If you are hitting the pommel, you are either posting too high and throwing your body forward or you are gripping too much with your thighs and bouncing.    When you post without stirrups, your seat barely leaves the saddle as you roll onto your inner thigh on the up beat and relax your thigh on the down beat.  Let the horse's movement lift you instead of working to lift yourself.  Keep the weight in your seat bones, your shoulders over your hips and allow your core (belly button area) to come "through".  The movement is only in your pelvis.  You should not be posting over the pommel.    The only pain you will feel if you are posting correctly is in your inner thigh muscles as they are doing all the work.

ba8dd4c6a9b532bef579aff3e8706fe7aa	This question proves yet again that most people here have NO sense of humor.    You need not only a flashing collar, but a beeper with a motion sensor, so it will go off if someone is getting close enough to be at risk from this dangerous tripping behavior.    You think that's bad - my Bassets will trip you and then try to crush you by sitting on your chest.  A few 60 lb hounds sitting on you is nothing to sneeze at!|`|bMYv0fBHaa	Oh my goodness! Why didn't you listen to the prejudiced morons of the world when you had the chance?!?    Get her a light-up bright orange vest. That'll do the trick.|`|6Nj5VZQ8aa	Contact the dog's owner and ask for an advice. If the dog is more than you can handle, you need to return the dog back. Pit Bull is not for everyone.|`|OMcIR0gYaa	give it back to the people who gave him to you to foster. you cannot take care of the dog and it is apparently not able to be  put up for adoption until it gets behavior training and even then will need to go into a special home with no kids and someone able to handle that dog    for now i suggest a muzzle will help    as for the tripping... never heard of a dog doing it that way lol im not sure what you should do other than warn ppl to watch out|`|SMFhXxcfaa	are you fostering her for a shelter?  if so contact them and ask them for advise.  Are you sure the dog doesn't have a hearing problem?|`|2b7mPq78aa	well im sorry but i think thats funny until someone gets hurt that is. i think u should give he/she more atention, but thats just my opinion. if its to much for u call the real owner and try to give the dog back.|`|b165361aa3bdfd3dd4401459ad6b7836aa	You said you are fostering the dog.  That could mean several things.  If you are holding her temporarily tell the organization or person who placed her with you that she is not working out.  If you adopted her take her back to where you got her.  It is better to return her and give her a chance to be placed in another home or re-adopted than to have something happen that would harm someone and cause her to possible be put to sleep.|`|ea7ea4b520a9f40ac43ca5df6167b5daaa	So she is just tripping them???? Not actually attacking?  I think you should contact the rescue group that you are dealing with and let someone else take her in as a foster.  Really? She is just tripping????  Or maybe you should video tape it and post it on youtube.|`|Za8DpfvQaa	OMG! She is DANGEROUS! Wow....she was lying on the floor? Ohhh, she is a big gig scary guard dog.    Hmmm....maybe you should meet my Dog. He will lick your face! Ouch, it HURTS!      Joking aside now.|`|NBK3s2LVaa	Are you kidding me? she not dangerous shes lazy, maybe you shouldn't foster care dogs if you think being lazy is dangerous at least shes not biting people|`|vVq74KI6aa	Have you contacted the shelter/people you are fostering the dog for? They can help you.. And tripping isn't that big of a deal. Maybe put the dog in a pen or a Cage when people come in the house or put her in a room by herself when people come home or over..|`|qKifQojBaa	IDK, thats sad yet really funnny|`|H7kmp0qdaa	If you think a dog laying completely still is dangerous, you should probably give her to someone who knows a bit more about dogs. I think laying down with her head down is extremely good behavior. The opposite end of the spectrum and bad behavior would consist of biting and aggression.    I don't know why i'm getting thumbs down. I own a pit and know a lot about the breed so get a life.|`|Uigfp5uOaa	OK first of all a dog laying on the floor is not an assassin or ninja.     you are being very dramatic.    he is sleeping and not trying to kill anyone. pick a room put a bed and let the dog stay there worst comes to worst if people dont look where there going. if the dog was guarding something there would be teeth growling and biting|`|FVuH3ySTaa	take her to obedience school, play with her, make her more active so she doesnt lay around so much    my dog used to be that way too and after i got her to be closer to me and get her to be active she never does it anymore|`|A9qDWpXUaa	LOL    Some serious training is needed here.     Train the humans to use their eyes and pick up their feet and a DANGEROUS trip or fall will be avoided!|`|cRb0u25Zaa	Um, this is really funny, but a bit sad. As for some of the other people who answered this: I don't think this is a real question. Just fyi.|`|wrUsMG4Jaa	This killed me! X-D    Put a flashing collar on her and turn it on when you're expecting company.

My fiances head made super friends with the wall when one of our older rescues didn't feel like moving!    We put a flashing collar on Nova and turned it on 'rapid' whenever we had guests over. We also had post-its on the side of doorways alerting people to look down prior to leaving the room!    I love how the stupid people think that this question is serious. WOW...|`|81675c7bcc2aa81478472216e01229f7aa	I can see the headlines now:  "Vicious Pit Bull kills by tripping"    Oh my goodness!  She sounds SO dangerous!

Well this is one of the  1 reasons Pit Bulls have become an unacceptable part of society. My friend was paralyzed for life after stumbling over one. I still can't get the violent image out of my head.  Maybe you can fill your house with neon green carpeting so people can keep a look out for when your dog is going to attack. Thats all I have. God bless you.|`|KhjpmxGeaa	If you don`t trust this dog talk to the person who owns or works where you saw her and filled out the form to foster her.Pit Bull Terriers need lots of attention and daily walks.Try and put a slip collar or leash on her and move her out of the way when guest are over or put her in a room were she can not get to someone.Your husband could have possibly spooked her,When you decided to foster her did you know what happened in her past?.Just be patient with her and tell her up or get her attention with a treat or something that will want to make her to get up,Maybe a favorite toy.If she is not interested when she sees the treat let her smell it,And when you continue to train her this way when you walk in the hall she will know to move and she will be rewarded.|`|pc7ZjexJaa	oooo    I'm shaking in my boots! no way I'm coming to your house!

Then get a new one.

rrFbQZzIaa	well they can be a lot of responsibility and a lot of money. I know my 7 dragons take up the majority of my food money and just overall work. You have to feed them 4 to 6 times a week so that means going to the pet store probably once a week for crickets or worms. You also have to make regular trips to the grocery store to pick up greens, vegetables and fruits and make them salads several times a week. The supplies can be pricey, especially with the UVB bulbs and the heat bulbs will blow out 2-4 times a year. They will usually poop once a day so that can be easy to clean and you'll want set aside time once a month to fully clean the cage. As long as your willing to take some time out of your day each day, you'll be fine and it shouldn't be tough at all. They can be fun pets to keep around but they aren't like a dog or cat. They aren't going to personally interect w/ you like wagging a tail or following you around. You mainly watch them be themselves or you can hold them or let them chill on your shoulder. A lot of people get board w/ them quickly so just make sure it's what you want and you should enjoy.  Also just be prepared to have it for possibly 10 years. in that time if you're going to college, you may not be able to take it w/ you to your dorm, if you will be in a dorm, so just be prepared w/ any future life plans and what you may be able to do if you dragon can't be a part of it.|`|7ZsMMkp5aa	Bearded dragons can be very fun, although they can be very hard to take care of. They have to have an apropriate cage size(40 gallon for an adult) they are also very hard to clean up for. Handling them can be very easy compared to many other lizards. I would not sudgest this for you unless you are prepare to take care of it properly. If you are, this can be a very good pet and friend. I also think that you can get all the info you can get and buy the beardie from a well trusted reptile store. WHATEVER YOU DO, DON'T GET A WILD ONE. THEY ARE OUT OF CONTROL. If you are not to sure about the beardie anymore, you might want to get a leopard gecko. I have several. They are much easy to take care of. The only problem is that they do not like to be handle that much. GOOD LUCK!|`|rLXNwqbFaa	there fun to play with and you only have to clean there cage and feed them once a day|`|Ty3ZSAXBaa	I just recently acquired one from my boyfriend, but I have been around them for a while now since i've been working at petsmart (1 and a half years). He is just about the cutest thing. They have such human-like personalities. Everyday all I do is cut him up some greens (which he never eats, but i do it anyways) and switch out his day/night heat lights. I check to make sure his water is clean and everything is alright, but that's about it. He gets a warm soak in the sink about 1-2 times a week and I spray him with water a couple times during the day.     He really is great and I enjoy having him as a pet.     Oh, by the way, he's about a year old. Not sure if it matters:)|`|DAtqr0QHaa	No prob. :]    Same here except I'm getting a Savannah Monitor.     Yeah they make awesome pets, fairly easy to take care of, not hard at all. :]    Good luck and happy early birthday. :]|`|qxkRS4bZaa	there fun and easy to keep
Ei85kgfdaa	Check the breed club website for reputable breeder referrals. You must also make sure to find a breeder who health tests hips, heart, eyes and elbows on the sire and dam; not just if the mom and pups are healthy at the time of the litter.|`|16XpYCBmaa	I am from pennsylvania too but I don't know anyone who is a breeder for rottweilers. I know there was recently german rottweilers for sale for 450 $ i seen a picture of them and they were adorable. Maybe look it up online and see if you can find a breeder in PA.
XWMfdjdnaa	Does it seem to be bothering her at all? like itching, or anything. A friend of mine just got her chihuahua spayed and it looked brutal. I think its just the fact its such a small dog it makes it look horrible. Lets say the exact same bump and red dots were on a lab, it wouldnt seem to bad or you probably wouldnt even notice it. I think she will be alright from seeing the pictures. Use your best judgment, if the bumbs and redness get worste or if the bumb just seems un-naturally large then i would stop by the vets and have them look at her. You might not even need to make an appt. you could carry her and flash her to a vet tech and they could tell you if its normal.|`|UeCgFgucaa	it,s some Allergy|`|cJxNY1Ctaa	it just looks like its infected or irritated. take her back to the vet and explain that the neosporin didnt help and maybe they can give you something for it.|`|c0f1359c19efc31ad29e3e86f3ebefc3aa	Bumps under the skin after an invasive surgery such as a spay are fairly common. Basically, the tissue underneath the skin takes a while to even back out. I would not be concerned as long as there was no fluid build-up, discharge or swelling.|`|AA11961672	It all looks pretty normal to me, like healing skin.   If you are really concerned I would take her back to the vets.
pc7ZjexJaa	I LOVE my PediPaws    it works great on my dane. and my boxer mix...shes coming around|`|SMFhXxcfaa	don't use anything like the pedipaws.  use this type of nail trimmer (follow link) the vet can also show you how to clip your pups nails. its really easy once you get the hang of it.  and also handle his feet when hes a pup so he is calm when you go to clip his nails and you have to hold his paw.    http://www.petsmart.com/product/index.js...|`|Mcf33eLbaa	Of the 3 you mention I would use a Dremel. I have tried the pedipaws but find that you can`t really get the nails short enough and it tend to stop turning if you put too much pressure on it.  The dremel is something you as well need to be careful with as you need to remember that while grinding the nail does tend to become hot if you keep it on the nail too long so only use it in short bursts.  Good Luck and God Bless|`|OnZDg0AEaa	hi,    Some dogs need a nail trim every month or so; others can go for several months without little or no trimming, usually because they do a lot of walking and running on hard surfaces.  here's more info:  http://www.mediumurl.com/?r=195588078124...    hope this helps.|`|gADpKFktaa	I have three dogs one chihuahua, Chihuahua Dashshund mix, and a st bernard, and the PediPaws works great on all three!!!|`|g8djyzFEaa	Don't waste your money on Peticure or PetiPaws!  A standard hardware dremel works great and is usually cheaper and higher in quality.  I use a dremel and highly recommend it!|`|tPGxPDvBaa	Buying a dremel is better than the other battery powered ones.  They often don't do well for big dogs or hold  a charge for long.  A dremel for the life of your dog plus it comes with other attachments that you can use(if handy).
l0ktQUnWaa	Either a turtle or a tortoise is a big commitment. I would suggest you do some research first. You can find both at the pet store, fairly inexpensive. When you add the cost of lighting, heating, a proper enclosure and anything else you may want they can get very expensive! Don't forget the vet. Here is some information.<br>  <a href="http://www.chelonia.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.chelonia.org/</a>|`|O037ZWxcaa	then just get a turtle|`|TxhYMSEAaa	most tortoises get pretty big depending on breed so if you don't want a big one probably go with a turtle.. but research first cuz most turtles and tortoises need special lighting and stuff and they are a big commitment.
McnuekTBaa	Sorry, folks, none of the above.    It's quite clear from the markings on the head, it is a Mississippi Map Turtle (Graptemys pseudogeographica kohnii).

2fdee6b1fd597a29209ecfad9dc8b598aa	I would say that it is an improvement.    My oldest girl recently suffered from a heliobacter infection that caused ulcers.  She was lethargic and anorexic while on the medication and it took MONTHS to get her back to what she was before (and she still will go off her food once in a while, now).  These medicines are necessary but VERY, VERY harsh on them.  What may help your little guy: probiotics.  It helps regulate and restore all the good bacteria in your fert's digestive track.  I get mine at: www.auntjeni.com  they're about $14 dollars and it's free shipping (always a plus).  Of course, get the 'Enhance Digestive Aid for Cats.' You can mix the capsule with a duck soup or other treat.  It's always helped mine feel better :)    Hope this helps and good luck!|`|BSEe9HYCaa	Yes it sounds like some improvement has been made but a full recovery has not. This means another trip to the vet is in order so your vet can help him make a full recovery. There could be any number of issues going on but the one thing you can be sure of is that it is not normal for a ferret of one year old to have their mobility reduced to the point that they can walk but not hop and jump anymore.   Your vet should be made aware of this and can team up with you to help get your little one back to 100% and the sooner the vet is able to get a proper diagnosis and start treatment the sooner your little one is able to start enjoying his health again.    Good luck!|`|KeevlZnTaa	I am sure that he will eventually get back to his old self. Some illnesses really assault the body and it takes awhile before getting back to normal. If he is still gaining weight than it may take until he is back to his normal weight until he is strong enough to play like he used to.
SMFhXxcfaa	was she just recently fixed?it could be a seroma or if she is fixed, most females get a pouch after they are altered.  if thats the case you have nothing to worry about.  if it might be a seroma you will need to contact a vet.|`|BlpJnZOoaa	first prengant if not its serious . its bloating.  my aunt got this.  take her to the vet,what happens is all the blood goes into the stomach and looks fat
cea6040e71e8f154dbc8b9c8e3bc2ce3aa	you will have to teach her to "hold it" or "carry it" with something she likes. Try using one of her toys to start with. When she takes it in her mouth, praise her...good hold in an uplifting voice. After she gets the hold command down then try using the flowers. Hold Sammy...good hold. Always end training sessions on a positive note. It will take time but you & Sammy can do it!!! Good Luck!|`|Mpf6UTx5aa	tie the flowers with a rubber band and put a treat inside when she gets use to it it will become normal to her that treats are in flowers.|`|kqa9VFrfaa	This could be done in a week by a real trainer, but if U have never done this before U R better tying the flowers to the collar. <br>  If U R still game U will have to work every day 3- 6 times a day. <br>  Start with chewy raw hides and real food. Use gravy on the flower stems. Make it fun. The commands are "take it" "hold" and "give". Reward & praise a lot.  Good luck.Read up on this also.|`|EKoRHgdgaa	You are not going to be able to train a dog to carry something within a week.<br>  <br>  Read this Best Answer by another Yahoo! user:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://au.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20080422182350AAjiMWC">http://au.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>
BhXOLas1aa	Often until it dies. It depends on how well the dog knew the person and how much time it spent with them.  Remember the dog who would never leave it's owners grave?   So sad....|`|hpX4up0maa	As long as they have you're scent they'll know you for a long long time|`|hTT8DhYfaa	they forget sights after not seeing something for 2 years. but they NEVER EVER forget senses such as smells..    okay, say joe the dog hasnt seen me for 1 and a half years..  then he smells my hand. and suddenly remembers EVERYTHING thats happened between me and joe.    i learned from my science teacher|`|xOwHCc0waa	Never, I'd doubt it.  How long would it take you to forget the face of a loved one?|`|Q5QE5T9Haa	depends if the dog was a pothead|`|gz5O9Tbpaa	Never as far as I know.    My dog and I lived with my parents for the first 9 months of his life. We moved a year ago. We have visited my parents twice and each time my dog knows exactly where we are going. We get about 20 minutes from their house and he completely freaks out! And when I let him out of the car he runs to the house looking for my mother. He will never forget where he came from! And who gave him all his morning rubs, extra snuggles, and extra chicken!!|`|pc7ZjexJaa	a dog will always recognize a scent    therefore.  the dog will most likley remember this person. maybe not the relationship with this person  a very very long time|`|9Y56hQRlaa	normally dogs never for get a person.. if they did ever it would probably take almost their whole life time!|`|NJfpY7nIaa	We had a man staying with us for a while since he had no place to go. Our dogs got to know him and were fine with him. After a year/year and a half of no contact they treated him like a stranger.  I think it depends on how strong the bond is between the dog and person. As well as the time of no contact.
DqUi0xPhaa	well considering the pups need to be weighed daily to ensure they are eating and gaining yes it is ok to touch them.  It really depends on the mom...sit on the floor petting mom and talking and see how she reacts to you being there.  My pups cried a lot when touched at first and she would get upset (not mean) so I just did my business with them when she was outside...just be patient and slow and see what she lets you do.    Good luck|`|AA11193920	It is really up to the dog.    Every litter that I have ever had at my house, I have handled from the moment of their birth. Not once has a puppy been "rejected" because of this.    I have a foster ****** here now who is extremely protective of her puppies to the point that I am sure that she could bite someone. However, I handle her puppies everyday. She doesn't have a choice and guess what, she hasn't "rejected" them either.    But again, I have a lt of experience with dogs and can read them very well. I will not ALLOW my children near this ****** right now because she is nervous and protective. The ****** of the other litters was just fine. Shoot! The cat went in with her puppies to check them out and she was fine with it! It is all the matter of common sense. If you are a novice, don't try it!|`|NJfpY7nIaa	Different mothers act differently.  Touching the babies excessively after birth is a big no, no. Unless it's of importance(their health or moving them to a different area).   If you do touch them. Make sure you don't have any lotion, purfume, or scent on your hands. Wash them with just water before(your hands...not the puppies).   The mother could reject the babies if you touch them or she could attack you. Or she might do nothing.  Even the sweetest dog can be overprotective of her puppies. She's being a mother...|`|OOWevyo0aa	depends on how you approach them.|`|16XpYCBmaa	It depends on your dog I guess. When my dog had puppies she let me n my family hold them but not my nephew and strangers. she got really aggressive and even tho its going for a year that she had them she is stil aggressive.
8NSh1D4Maa	Sorry to hear about your rabbit.  You will probably never know for sure what happened without having a vet do a necropsy.  Since it was hot, it could have been heat -related, rabbits are heat stressed at around 80F (26C), and really shouldn't be kept outside without provisions made for temperature moderation.  But, the screaming (a noise rabbits make when in extreme pain) makes me think that this is not the case.  The other likely scenario is a predator induced heart attack, which is another issue with rabbits housed outdoors.  Just the presence of a predator trying to get at them outside the cage can send them into a frenzy trying to escape, causing a heart attack, or even causing the rabbit to break their spine by flinging themselves against the cage walls in an attempt to escape.  Housing rabbits indoors doubles their lifespan, on average, due to the reduction in environmental stresses and also the greater attention paid to an indoor pet's habits and well-being.|`|Iq9BUMBuaa	you talk to much|`|BlpJnZOoaa	sniff its so sad.  i have a rabbit and she is one. i know what you fell i had a dog once lived for 2 months died by a car sniff he probaly saw a big animal or heard a loud noise rabbits get heart attacks easy|`|DAtqr0QHaa	Maybe it was heatstroke or he got paralized.     im sorry. :[|`|jz0YekUEaa	he might have had a heart attack. or a seizure|`|hMSPAq3vaa	maybe something scared him to death|`|BjFat2raaa	Sounds like heatstroke. I saw it happen once and it's just like you described. The belly is also very mushy feeling.. like their muscles aren't working at all. Also there will be moisture around the nose because they'll kinda sweat out their nose before they go into full heatstroke. There also may be blood in the nose... doesn't have to be though.     I was able to save some (it was a whole litter) by dunking them in a bucket of water (except their head).. then I gave RL solution under their skin (saline solution.. like what they give in IV's). Saved all but one.    BTW - I didn't put those rabbits in the sun.. the neighbor kids came over.. didn't tell me they were there.. took the litter of rabbits outside in a cage and left them in the sun on a really hot Summer day. The barn got a padlock after that.|`|ABJPBIH9aa	I feel so sorry about your rabbit. He sounds like a nice rabbit. Well I guess all you can really do is try to move on. I have never had one of my pets die. Except fish. My friend's pet rabbit died one day she was sad. But she moved on she still remembers her. I don't exactly know what to do sorry I was not much help well at least I don't think I was much help.
ak9DrBSwaa	Syrian hamsters - those are the larger ones should be kept alone. They are sold under several different names like Golden, Teddy Bear, Panda Bear.    The dwarf types are social and need to live in small groups.    If you have an appropriate cage and clean it regularly there shouldn't be a smell.    A site with hamster information  that you may wish to read, so you can be sure this is the right pet for you - http://www.hamsterific.com/hamsters.cfm|`|7WUvPI8maa	it does not matter how small the hamster is- they can all smell. any hamster is good at living alone- i use to have numerous teddy bear hamsters growing up one right after the other. as long as you keep on top of cleaning the cage you should be fine. good luck. they make terrific pets.
fzaf5t3Caa	oh i have a great idea for you!! You should get a cavalier king charles spaniel! Or even a cavapoo (cavalier king charles /poodle) . Cavaliers are really smart dogs. My cavapoo knows atleast fifteen tricks already and she is only eight months old. She is adorable too!! cavaliers are really cuddly dogs and were made to warm the kings feet up!! Its true. They are really nice dogs. If you didn't have a golden retriever already that would have been my first suggestion but cavaliers are great dogs as well!Good luck and if you have any question please feel free to email me!|`|bmEV62gyaa	maltese puppies are the cutest little babies ever!  just the same size for a (yorkie) right?  search maltese puppy on goolge images :)  they are very cute playful lap-dogs!|`|d57kBHHfaa	I work at an animal hospital as a tech. I also have three dogs and I would have to say my Boston Terrier fits your description perfectly. He has a huge personality and weighs only 25 lbs. He was the quickest to learn potty training and other tricks, and is a very family friendly breed. If you need more help with research I would go to the American Kennel Club website for a description of all their recognized breeds. Also, Beware the new mixed breeds like the labradoodles and yorkipoos. They are over priced and usually the worst part of both breeds put into one dog(i.e hips and heart problems.) Good luck with your search.|`|mOZfR8yhaa	I have a dog that is perfect for you! I have a Miniature Schnauzer at my house. She is very playful and loyal. Miniature Schnauzers are in the terrier group so they will have a lot in common. If you want the perfect dog TRUST ME. They are smart loyal playful and easy to train. Most of them are very cute. They aren't big at all and will do what you say whenever you say it. I hope I helped. Ps. Have fun with whatever dog you choose!

034f5753f9ad6567e841eda4b3bd8210aa	I've never seen it done, but it is perfectly the judge's right, just like having a bit check.  Most judges are required to do a bit check once per day, but some do it more often.  When I worked as a show groom for an Arabian barn, I never saw a judge call for a "strip", but it's always possible.|`|hEXb1unraa	The only time I know this to be done is in combination classes....Park/driving class where the horse has to do a change up....Most traditional Park and English pleasure classes don't ask for the strip.

ndqjst7taa	Get a job. Your going to have to o a lot of saving. Horses cost 1000 and up then to board anything from 250.00 and up then vets and farrier cost and equipment. So you need a lot of money|`|6JE0mcrLaa	Someone else suggested babysitting, which actually isn't a bad idea. I have to babysit my neighbor at least once a week, and I get $5 an hour. Last week I babysat him a total of three times and got $55. You should also do extra chores around the house to earn extra allowance. Once you've earned your weekly allowance, put at least half of it in the bank. Pick up every penny, quarter, dime etc. off the street and put it in a jar. It may only come out to be $5, but hey, that's enough to buy a grooming brush. Just spend your money wisely, and put away the money that you don't need. After a while, you'll have enough.|`|IyCnihLmaa	Get a job mucking stalls.  You can maybe ride a little and learn about horses as you are earning the money for one - plus you will see if you really want to do the work involved in keeping a horse.  Not everyone who likes the idea of keeping a horse actually likes it once they see how much work is involved.|`|Q1U8hP1Xaa	Babysitting! That sounds like a really lame answer..I know..but it's hard finding jobs in this economy...if you're of age,you could probably get a job at a fast food restaraunt or grocery store too. Just giving you ideas! And once you do have that awesome,(permanent) job...Good Luck!! Horses are one of the most amazing creatures ever,and can be an absolute Joy to own!    *EDIT* And like Clynnny stated,IF you have stables or a horse related place around your area looking for a worker..that would be awesome,because you'd be around/working with horses and earning money for one. If you have an area like that around,I'd really go for it!|`|yQIOXv5Yaa	if there is a local stable, help out there. That will earn you money, give you more practice and expirience around horses, plus you will be friends with the people you might board with in the future. On top of that, you might be able to get a lower boarding fee and if there are any barn horses for sale you will have an advantage there.     if that's workable it would definitely be the best job for you.    if not, then just get a regular job and start saving!|`|fa27c3346599fbfc609df0721c669bd4aa	When you turn 16, get a job everyday after school making at least  minimum wage.  You will be able to save up enough to initially buy a horse.  But you  need to be consistantly making an income to pay board.  So you will still need to have a job after school.  If your not 16 then it's illegal for you to work.  You could do under the table work like working at a stable but thats about it.|`|g62woUDQaa	So....you can't get a job, but you want to earn money.  Do you expect it to just fall out of the sky into your lap?  I suppose given your limitations, if you get birthday gift money, or christmas gift money, be strict about putting it back and not spending it, perhaps try babysitting, which, if you're old enough to be on YA (13) you might find someone that finds you to be trustworthy of that responsibility.  Otherwise, study a lot, and wait until you're old enough to get a job.|`|eRTwqowgaa	Try to find a job at a local stable feeding or even cleaning stalls..something so that you're around horses and horse people and can learn more about them before you buy your own horse...then if you keep your horse there you might be able to work a little of your board off. good luck!|`|d23dd8c2868038699160a74156805d44aa	A job? Try finding a place nearby as a barn help, if you have not owned a horse before you'll learn a lot about the care of horses. If you have experience in horses, you can do other things as well. I ended up teaching 4-H classes when I was a teenager and eventually went to classes and became a riding instructor. The price of the horse is not the expensive part however, its the accesories and care. My thoroughbred gelding (a novice show horse when i bought him) cost me $5,000 to start, but care exceeded 2-3,000$ a year in boarding, shows, vets bills, farrier bills, etc. A non-show horse would cost much less to start but the cost of care would be about the same and more if its a horse in poor health or older. Just things to keep in mind.     In the meantime, look out for cheap partial-leases, or free riding oppurtunities. I found many in my area before I purchased my horse.
Fx9bxZ8aaa	corys are the best company for bettas.for males and females.they get along.they won't pick on it.just don't add tropical fish or it won't be good.the tank will do good with just one female betta and the 3 corys.but if you really want to have 2 of them then it will be okay.|`|hzxQMU0Caa	yes u can put 3 cory cats in with a tank with 2 bettas because the betta fish wont care only if the different gender of the betta is in the smae tank doesnt matter the fish u put in with the 2 bettas GO FOR IT.|`|vvJBtxXHaa	those are perfect tank mates, you could add a 4 to 5 more female bettas and a couple more corys  ...and like BUBBLES stated, female bettas enjoy a group environment of 6 or so    ...since the corys are bottom dwellers and the bettas are mid-level dwelllers they do not crowd for living space  ...stay with the smaller corys that don't exceed 1.5" to 2" when fully grown  ...also.. be sure your water filter is cycling the 10 gallons 2 to 2 1/2 times each hour (then you could have 10 or 12 fish max    just fyi, the water filter cycling capacity is shown on the box it came in  ...if for any reason the filter is not processing  20 to 30 gallons every hour, then the number of fish should be kept at a minimum  ....but on the other hand, if it is, then the number of fish in your 10 gallon can be max'd out   (just be sure to change water 15%-25% every 8 to 10 days) to be sure ammonia levels are not able to spike    Edit  1: "haha, who is the "grumpie-fish" that is thumbing everyone down here" LOL Cheer up!

PHOyKsmPaa	Males are always colorful with long draping fins. Females  have short fins and are not as showey.

For names, the great thing about naming a fish is you can name them any old stupid name you can think of because you never have to call it out in public.  I named my beta Murphy because I bought him when I was having a very bad day so I named him after Murphy's Law ("anything that can go wrong, will go wrong")|`|KAjFbpyAaa	The only true way to sex bettas is that the females have a false egg spot by there vent.

Whh0G1eJaa	You can get a gravel vacuum that removes water along with the waste. So each week when you do your water change, you suck up the crud from the bottom.<br>  <br>  Most of the vacuums are called "self starting" which means it will establish a flow of water into the tube by moving it up and down rapidly in the water.  Once the water is flowing into the tube and into a bucket, move it around the bottom.  You can suck up the gravel, and only the junk will go through the tube and the gravel will sink back down.<br>  <br>  The amount of time it takes is relative to the size of the hose/tube.  I have a large one for my 29 gallon tank and can remove 25% of the water and vacuum the bottom in about 2 minutes.  The small one for my 10 gallon, takes a little bit longer, even though I'm removing less water.  You should do this once a week.<br>  <br>  The cost should be somewhere between $10 and $25, depending on the size.|`|1D8tMCYIaa	Every time you clean your tank or even do water changes you should use the gravel vac.<br>  <br>  I had to watch a video on youtube to actually figure out how to use the vacuum. <br>  <br>  The way I know when it starts working is when the water starts to pour into the bucket.<br>  <br>  They aren't that expensive, no more than 20 bucks.|`|MKuDawP7aa	AQUARIUM CLEANING BASICS<br>  <br>  For cleaning your aquarium (freshwater or saltwater) a Gravel Vacuum attached to a siphon or recirculating filter works best. If you have a planted aquarium, I recommend #00 sand (3-5 cm) mixed with laterite or conditioned soil with #3 gravel (2-3 cm) on top. You should NOT vacuum the sand, as this will tend to be sucked all the way thru the vacuum, and this will also disturb the natural aerobic and anaerobic filtration going on in the substrate being performed by the bacteria and plant roots.<br>  <br>  A new device that performs both water removal and recirculation thru a micron filter cartridge that is easily cleaned is the Aquarium Cleaning Machine. This new device uses a protected mag drive motor to remove or recirculate your water thru a filter (or both). For saltwater changes, this device is a money saver and fish saver. You can change 20% of your water, then keep refiltering it thru the micron cartridge using the gravel vacuum do pick up debris. This saves having to use more salt for larger water changes and keeps a healthier aquarium with lower nitrates, as much of the debris is removed from your system before it can go thru the nitrogen cycle (adding to the Nitrate levels).
cFKFhCPhaa	Cute! Watch as he's learning that you don't rush and tip yourself forward to early, if you put that weight on his shoulders it will make him rush, thus causing some nervousness and bad habits. Just build up a topline on him and a back end by doing more flatwork first. Then when he has enough musle tone, start your over fences, get him to jump with impulsion from behind and underneath and to develop a better bascule. Big releases and lots of praise cause he's so green. With the right training you may have a nice little over fences horse on your hands. Keep up the good work!    PS: Your position is not that bad at all over fences for not jumping in four months!|`|I8dkpUQ7aa	Awww what a cutie. What's his name? And yes he definitely has jumping potential, especially since he's already jumping. I jumped a Shire, so that tells you that he can for sure jump. You guys are off to a great start|`|shrdQ5guaa	Your horse is soo cute, I love his face markings!  As for the jumping, he defenetly has potential, most thoroughbreds are good jumpers. I would put on a standing or running martingale, as he seems to put his head very high. Basicly, he is very loose in the front end but I'm sure he will tighten up the higher you go. In the mean time I would work on alot of flat work, and dressage so that you know that he is atleast balanced, which will help you alot in jumping.    Goodluck with him!|`|8rVodF9vaa	Well, he looks like a typical OTTB and he has the usual issues, so I won't comment on those. As far as jumping goes, hes willing to try, and he figured out how to pick up his knees, so thats a good start.     I understand that you haven't jumped much lately, but could you practice on a different horse? A very green horse isn't going to be very forgiving of your mistakes. If you don't have another horse to practice on -  grab mane!|`|ECgFNEWjaa	He's a cute fellow and seems quite willing based on your photos and video.  Take more time with his flat work so that he builds a better, more round frame. Then he will be able to use his back better over the jumps and have a better bascule.  In your pictures, he isn't tight with his front end which becomes more important as the height of the obstacles increases.

SZOMVGBRaa	The spectrum doesn't matter as long as its not like black light or anything like that. If you don't have plants you don't need to worry about spectrum's or watts or any of that.

shrdQ5guaa	You actually can give him a bath, you just have to make sure the water your using is warm, and you bathe him inside your barn. If your barn does not have warm water, fill buckets of hot water in your house. Then use a shampoo, but dilute it like crazy so that there wont be much to wash off. First use one or two buckets of water just to wet him first. Put a cap full or so of shampoo in one bucket, and lather up a sponge. Dump some on his back, scrub him all over, wash his mane and dip his tail in the bucket then use a sweat scraper to take off the extra soap. Then use two or three large buckets of water to rinse him off. Sweat scrape him again, making sure there isn't any left over soap. After use a few towels too towel his legs, face and body off, make sure to use a fleece or terry clothe sheet, and put it on right after hes been washed so he doesn't catch a chill.The sheet should keep him warm until he dries.    An alternative to this would be to just groom him REALLY really well, then use a spray bottle to wet him slightly, then wipe him down with a towel. Then use a "waterless shampoo" from your tack store, and it basically cleans your horse, and you don't need to rinse him off.    Goodluck      uhm, i dont think its that much.  about 9 dollars. Heres the one I use.  http://www.drsfostersmith.com/product/pr...|`|y7H1V39Jaa	I used to keep teams going all winter long on the carriage, looking like they had been bathed ever time I hitched them.    I used one of those rubber (with little knobbies on them) mitts and did nothing more than dip one of those rubber mitts, you know the ones with the "knobbies" on them in plain, (no soap) warm water and completely groom the horses.  It only cleans the hair, never wetting the skin.  When finished with that, I sprayed Show Sheen on them and used the mitt again.  They always looked as if they had just been bathed and it's quick as well.|`|hEXb1unraa	If you know of a bigger barn near you that has a heated barn and hot water in their wash stall just ask if you pay them 20 bucks if you can haul over there and use the wash shower and give your horse a nice bath and let him stay there till hes completely dry...would take a day to do this but at least he would be nice and clean if he will not tolerate a vacuum.|`|LAXxaxAZaa	If you have to do it, I'd put some water in a spray bottle and spray him while rubbing him with a towel. Then put some Show Sheen or something like that on him.|`|XL62syrCaa	I agree with the above person. But since it is the middle of winter I doubt the people will mind if hes dirty. As long as he is well groomed (mane and tail dont have burrs or mud tangled in it, there arent  any big pee/poop/mud spots. Dirt is kind of part of having a horse. Also maybe try spraying show sheen and then wiping off with a rag or towel. That should gather the dust as well as giving your horse a nice sheen.|`|Uib2Lmywaa	Try a vacuum (hose) if he'll stand for it.

3p6wp7DYaa	Most dogs won't poop where they sleep. But your kennel has to be small enough that he cannot poop in one corner and sleep somewhere else. Either buy him a crate that is only big enough for him to stand up and turn around (or one  that comes with a divider) or get a smaller kennel. It helps to take him with you to the pet store and get help from somebody there who knows what kind and size you should get.    The other possible explanation (most unpleasant) is that he is used to lying in his own feces, maybe because of his living conditions until you adopted him. Some dogs that come from puppy mills are so used to having pee and poop in their small cages that they get used to having it all over their fur and everything. When he poops in the kennel, does he usually mess himself up? If the answer is no, the kennel is too big. But, if the kennel you have is just the right size and he is still messing it up, you need to do some serious research about it. Maybe you can drop him off at doggie day care during the day when you're at work...    Good luck!|`|Z7iyuBVEaa	every time he "goes" in the kennel punish him and put him outside for about 10 min or however long u want(but make sure its long enough) and when he "goes" outside reward him by saying good dog. thats what we did!! it worked in about two to three weeks! but then again pottytraing dogs depends on the dog|`|wMoHsO78aa	he needs to go out to use the bathroom more !!! not every 3 hours
5QxrQF7yaa	of course they do i tired it once because and ran it over and it lived and then i drowned it and it came back out of the ground creepy but cool|`|NEV7Slroaa	no, it's just an old saying|`|48qIS5veaa	yes they do.

People say that as an expression, because its really hard to kill a cat.     Cats have surived: Deformitys, attacks, beatings, being hit by a car, falling from very high distances, half-drowning, heart-stopping, cuts, breath-loss, and pretty much everything else. Its pretty hard for them to die but I still worry my cat is going to get killed outside. :/|`|AA10898750	no but the reproduce the same colors over and over and long after the original cat dies they see the other offspring and say that cat has 9 lives or it could come from them being able to land on their own feet when falling|`|0ehkP9qMaa	Nope, they can just spread out their ribs (no joke) so they don't fall so hard. (don't get how that works though)|`|TuOp3hNPaa	lmao well it looks like u found ur idiots: em uh le, heretic, and maddie  haha wow|`|o6uwV66jaa	O_O  I hope you kidding lol.  No, all it means is that Cats can get themselves out of alot of other positions that other animals can't  . .and  once there dead there dead...lol...no 8 lives after..|`|5y9kJjDdaa	No. We are animals and they are animals. We all act the same. We eat, we sleep, we do actions, and we speak. But as you know if humans die they don't reborn its a myth. But it could be real cause Hindus believe that and i don't want to say it in a way that makes them think i am saying that what they believe is bad cause i believe something else. But it is true no other creature from my sight can have more than 1 life.|`|IDVFsy5waa	noo...|`|Mr0rTg8saa	umm no.|`|fkqPs9QRaa	no lol|`|VK3kyzGDaa	I have heard that.    But How could cats die, then come back till the die 8 more times?    I dont think so.....|`|AA11965234	you could kill a cat and see if it comes back to life.    ohhh wait, that's unethical.        i really hope no one says yes, haha.|`|hTT8DhYfaa	yes. because when they die, (cats are indian) they come back to life in another cat's body! thats why the cats w/ bad homes die, because they want better lives, and the good-living-cats live for a long time...        haha JUST KIDDING. but that would be cool.... anyways, good question :)    toodeloo!    |`|MklhprnLaa	No, but they are extremely good at not dying in situations where death seems to be the most likely outcome.|`|Hu4sEk2Faa	Then why ask? Obviously not. Everything has one life.|`|3hDXqH4Raa	does a dog really have its day....wise up|`|qXlBsRLgaa	your the idiot asking the question|`|LYygh76Iaa	No silly !
kwVHlZcFaa	To be able to make a somewhat complete analysis about the span of dog memory, it is important to differentiate between associative memory and real memory. It is said that if a dog does not have some sort of exterior stimulus that he is not able to think about or remember parks or places he has been in before. But as soon as dog hears his owner's voice, smells him or perceives his presence at a distance, his associative memory activates or comes to life.    More info here  http://www.seefido.com/html/dog_memory.h...|`|gMNXzDa0aa	Well they do have short memories cause they already forgot about there Mom cause my dog is like never sad!

0ojkiEBEaa	I happen to know that YES, they can. i switched food for my little chi-pin and she preferred the new food to the old. i combined the new and old food and she would pick through the food and eat all the new kibble. both kibble looked the same other than the slight size difference.|`|GWRP3vLQaa	I have a Shih-Pooh and when I give her treats, I give her 3 different treats and lay them out on the floor. She sniffs all three several times and then chooses one of them. I love it!|`|gKGROtYSaa	My doggie won't eat her vegetables unless we squirt salmon oil or olive oil on them.  Using her sniffer, that's her choice.

I really liked the name cleopatra actually, thats a cool name for a snake haha.|`|F3FrZ7eAaa	I like names after states and countries a lot. Some examples: India, Brooklyn, Arizona, London, Paris, Asia, Dallas, Denver, Phoenix and Vegas. Or maybe some nature themed names:lily, rose, flower, daisy, ocean, marina.

auUeI2Vnaa	Mine is great.  Somewhat protective when he doesn't need to be...but better safe than sorry I guess.  He's also great with the kids.  I really think a dogs attitude has more to do with how he is brought up, not what breed he is....|`|Ulff1hcDaa	Pit Bulls are wonderful dogs but they are not for everyone!      The biggest concern is the high exercise need. Mine gets 20 minutes on the treadmill in the morning with a weighted back pack. He then gets a short walk when I get home and a longer walk after dinner...both with the weighted back pack. He has a spring pole in the back yard for the in-between times and several tug toys for his very favorite activity...tug-o-war!! A huge chunk of my day is spent on making sure he gets enough exercise.    Next is training. These dogs are heavy and solid. They have to be taught not to jump on people and to be careful with teeth. As with any dog, if he gets too excited while playing there is the possibility of tooth to skin contact. This breed has such powerful jaws that they can hurt someone without even trying. They have to be trained that teeth on skin is never ok....not even when they are little....not even when they are playing. With my dog it's a constant check in to make sure he is calm and focused and listening. He has to sit before I put down his food, he has to be willing to release when in a game of tug-o-war, he has to respond when told to stop...and on and on and on.    ...and lets not forget socialization! Just seeing a Pit Bull walking towards them is enough to worry some people....a Pit Bull running and jumping on them and/or their pet will likely send them into a complete panic. It is important to train your pup to meet people and other pets with grace and control. I got my dog when he was 1 1/2 years old and this was by far the hardest bad habit to break. It's worth the work though....now when I come home I see a happy dog who sits and waits for his greeting instead of knocking me over in excitement.     Please think long and hard before plunging into a lifetime of living with a Pit Bull. The shelters are full of Pit Bulls who were too much for uninformed owners. They are routinely dumped and are really hard to adopt out. These dogs are not just pets, they are a huge comitment of time and energy. There are many many breeds that are also wonderful but have fewer intense requirements. If you don't have the time....if you don't have the energy....if you are just not sure.....pick a different dog.|`|K2jT1z5jaa	hey    Great Dogs. & Companion  Great Guards aswel. they will attack if they are being intruded on in their own property by a theif which is good.  They are easy to handle aslong as they trained by a personnel who knows what they are doing. Because they are strong dogs.  A walk around the block will be easy if dog is a good listener and obeyer.    You can trust them. Just like any other dog.     Pit bull mix is different. Pure bred and mix.

Originally bred to "bait" bulls, the breed evolved into all-around farm dogs, and later moved into the house to become "nanny dogs" because they were so gentle around children. Their tenacity, gameness, and courage make them popular competitors in the sports of weight pulling, agility, and obedience competition.  here's more info:  http://www.mediumurl.com/?r=578122460734...    hope this helps.|`|teKAmT6Haa	i had  a pitmix and she was soo sweet good with the kids but kinda wild and crazy..i loved her though..they are really great dogs  well anyway hope i helped|`|YSx70imwaa	They are a little hard to handle as a pup, for like the fist 3-6 months. But after they are trained, they are awesome.|`|U1RcZjqJaa	I was very unsure about getting my first pit bull but I absolutely love the breed. They are a breed that is going to need a very dominant owner (I am not suggesting an abusive owner, but one that will show the dog where they rank). They do have a lot of energy so excercise is a must and I have found training fairly easy because they are eager to please. They must be socialized from a young age and continued socializtion as they grow.|`|mPS2Zccaaa	I have a Pitbull and he is fantastic. I have NEVER had any issue with him. He is a protective dog but is so sweet and gentle. He loves playing with my 2 year old nephew and has been playing with him since he was 1 years old. My dog is 5 years old and is well disciplined and trained. There are a lot of misconceptions about this breed because of the fighting some people use them for. They are terriers and are extremely active and fearless which is why they are used for fighting. But this breed will be an extremely loyal companion. If you discipline your dog and train them you will not have any problems. I love my dog and would not want any other pet. If you want this breed of dog, don't be scared. Just train him well, instill discipline and give him tons of love.|`|7KGXRu19aa	There great as long as you raise them right|`|OjYhh4Oxaa	i had one , great dog. super friendly. he used to fall asleep with his face on my lap. cutest thing ever .    dogs are like children, depends how you raise them..    great dogs!|`|wrUsMG4Jaa	I don't own them, BUT I have rescued well over 320 APBTs and can honestly tell you that they aren't for someone who has difficulties with strict and constant training.     APBTs are fantastic dogs if you have done your research and understand what you're looking for. I suggest finding a rescue and RESCUING a dog (they have them from babies to seniors) that has been temperamentally and behaviorally screened.    Its best to get your information from a singular source that gives you the good and the bad of the breed, PBRC is the best one I've found thus far:  http://www.pbrc.net/    You can also find rescue groups listed on PBRC via this link:  http://pbrc.net/webapp/cgi-bin/search.cg...

You have to train them early. Don't let them get away with things that you don't want a 60 pound dog doing. You have to be every careful where it comes form. DONT go to a back yard breeder. If you can exercise it at least 1 hour long walk every day plus playing in the yard, it might be the right dog for you. If not don't get one. They have to get their energy out or they will have training problems. I work at a vet clinic most of them are are huge babies. I love the breed but I don't have the lift still to have one at this time.|`|Xs3BoGV4aa	Denise, I wish I had a a american pit bull terrier.
x8c4pbJWaa	Hi!    Yes, you should definitely try to take them sooner than later. If it is a respiratory infection, it is likely that they both will end up having it. That said, it is most likely a mild respiratory infection which is very common in multiple cat households. The vet will most likely give you an oral antibiotic (Clavamox) to give to your cat twice a day - it would be wise of you to make sure the vet gives you antibiotics for BOTH of your cats. Make sure you have them take the entire prescription, otherwise the infection will most likely return.     A respiratory infection is not serious at first, but if time goes by & it doesn't get any better, a respiratory infection can lead to a very serious problem. When you go to the vet, ask him/her to give them an antibiotic "booster" shot before you leave, to give the oral antibiotics a "kick-start" -- In Pittsburgh (where I am) You're looking at a vet bill between $80-$150 for the appointment, shots & medication for the both of them. But, considering you only have to take them once a year, it's not much to spare.    Another possibility is allergies which is usually successfully treated with anti-histamines.    Other times, cats older than 7 years of age with constant sneezing/watery eye(s) you should worry about a nasal tumor, which my cat aged 17 was just diagnosed with. He sneezed for 8 months strait, accompanied by nose bleeds & water eyes. Antibiotics did not work for him & the symptoms continues to get worse, which is how he was finally diagnosed with a nasal tumor. I learned that 50% of dogs & cats over the age of 10 will develop cancer! Amazingly, my 17 year old cat is completely healthy & so we have no idea if or when this nasal tumor will get the best of him. I'm hoping for the miracle here & it's looking pretty good.|`|BKZO8E0waa	It is better to go earlier.|`|vZFLG75Zaa	Yes.  MY cat started sneezing a lot and getting runny noses... I took her to the vet, she had a nasty cold and the vet gave rather inexpensive medications for her.  She was fine in no time :)|`|AA11171398	Sneezing can be lots of things...from the cleaners your using to the new perfume your wearing, to dust, to her own hair tickling her nose.    I would consult my vet and have her checked soon, since a respiratory problem can easily progress into something serious if left untreated.    Things that can be marked as urgent are runny eyes, discharge or boogies, panting, heavy breathing, lack of appetite, lack of energy, lethargy, vomiting, dry heaving, trouble going to the bathroom, diarrhea, coughing, or any funny sounds while breathing (not while purring).
wF52XMxAaa	Zupreem pellets should be fine.  You can mix a bit of seed in with it, or feed some as treats. There's nothing wrong with a little seed - it just shouldn't be much of his diet.  The fruit and veggies sound excellent.    As for sleeping, are there perches high up in the cage?  You could also try a birdie bed of some sort (snuggle hut, snuggle sack, cuddle buddy, etc.).  Quakers often like them.|`|v6coHbIeaa	On feeding your Quaker i would talk to a vet.Make sure the diet is ok.My vet is a bird D.R. She told me not to give my Quaker any seed at all. use grain with the pellets.I can still feed the rest of my parrots seed.The rest of the diet is real good.|`|d57kBHHfaa	I have two quakers and they LOVE Mullet seeds. I wouldn't give it to them everyday because they are a bit fattening, but the aren't harmful, and are a great way to spend quality quiet time with them.|`|gatbKvmSaa	Quakers are known to be extremely good eaters. They thrive on fresh fruits and vegetables, and do well in captivity when this diet is supplemented with quality commercial pellets and seed. Some quakers tend to become overweight if allowed to indulge in too many fattening nuts and seed treats, so be sure to offer your Quaker fresh greens, legumes, pasta, and other vegetables as a main food source.    But you have to change the food slowly, mix the Zupreme and the seeds together and slowly LITTLE BY LITTLE put less and less seeds in it it may take months b-4 he eats just the pellets, I believe the birds should have some seeds they eat them in the wild.    As far as sleeping on the side of the cage if that what he likes it is ok, mine love to sleep in a hut. they are wonderful little birds, In captivity, they tend to bond very closely with one person GOOD LUCK    kristie and her friends  crackers  nipper-jenday  boo-dyh amazon
AA11171398	What you could be seeing is not the side effects of the spay, but of the anesthesia. It can have a very odd effect on cats...mine was kind of loopy as well after hers.    Just so you know cats should be kept confined for 10-14 days after a spay for risk of reopening the incision. I kept my cat in my closet (i have a reasonably sized walk in) where they can't jump and run although they will try.    The biting could be a switch in hormones. She suddenly no longer is ovulating, and her body must adapt to this new change...sort of like women with menopause. She is having mood swings. I would personally monitor her behavior while with the other cat, and keep them separated when you can't. Her moods could switch to a more aggressive point easily.     Keep a squirt bottle handle for if it happens. You never want to stick your hand in a cat fight, although many people do. What also works is banging a wooden spoon on a frying pan, or clapping your hands. This should work for the less bold cats. Most of the time if the cat associates the punishment with you (they SEE you squirting them) then they will run from you and do what ever they are doing when your not around. Banging something in the next room may make her think there is some mystical force at work,|`|tZxVey2baa	I wouldn't worry cats act weird when they get home from being spayed or neutered.Its really a side effect of the anesthesia and drugs they gave her. My cat came home after being neutered and took a bath in his water bowl.|`|zWBYxMvWaa	She might have a reverseeffect to the pain meds.      Most of the time they are supposed to make them slow, but it affects your cat differently.|`|25660b99958e6df83f2c651134b3891faa	probably a side effect of the meds, call the vet and check.    the biting then licking, i have seen this before. i think mom gets confused. she thinks her kitten is lost and tries to carry it back to the nest, then realizes he is too big to be carried, and licks him as a way comforting, saying she is sorry.  if a mom has to rescue a kitten, say it wanders from the nest and screams, after she brings it back, she licks it. grooming is comforting to cats.|`|RWgjnwl9aa	C ats' can all act differently when they get bck home  the anesthesia will catch up to her & she'll sleep dilated eyes are normal  biting & then licking the kitten is also normal  I have 4 cats all fixed 3 came home & just slept but 1 came home & ran all over the place  some cats are more excitable than others don't worry OK|`|p5CrZ5Bwaa	They use a drug or a pain killer that makes it so they dont feel anything and its normal that how my cat was. so the drug it like gets them high or drunk and it should ware off in a day or so
AA12393315	The only thing that I know a dog can get from a cat is Worms or fleas, but if your worried talk to your vet, they will be able to put your mind at ease, just call and ask they will tell you if you need to bring your dog in|`|MvX2Hg9Taa	take the dog to the vet|`|NFRr2uKqaa	i think only a licensed vet would have access to the type of test you would need. what is your dog doing, or how is your dog behaving to make you suspect this?    i found this information to be very interesting...and if your dog is older than 2 and also vaccinated i don't think you need worry. also since i could find no connection between chlamydia from cats to dogs, only from cats to humans, i think you might be safe...but read this and see weather you think this is interesting to...    Dr. Jean Dodd's NEW vaccine protocol  PERMISSION TO CROSSPOST    VACCINATION NEWS FLASH    *I would like to make you aware that all 27 veterinary schools in North America are in the process of changing their protocols for vaccinating dogs and cats. Some of this information will present an ethical & economic  challenge to vets, and there will be skeptics.    Some organizations have come up with a political compromise suggesting vaccinations every 3 years to appease those who fear loss of income vs. those concerned about potential side effects. Politics, traditions, or the doctor's economic well being should not be a factor in medical decision.    NEW PRINCIPLES OF IMMUNOLOGY  "Dogs and cats immune systems mature fully at 6 months. If a modified live virus vaccine is given after 6 months of age, it produces an immunity which is good for the life of the pet (ie: canine distemper,parvo, feline  distemper). If another MLV vaccine is given a year later, the antibodies from the first vaccine neutralize the antigens of the second vaccine and there is little or no effect. The titer is not "boosted" nor are more  memory cells induced." Not only are annual  boosters for parvo and distemper unnecessary, they subject the pet to potential risks of allergic reactions and immune-mediated hemolytic anemia.  "There is no scientific documentation to back up label claims for annual administration of MLV vaccines." Puppies receive antibodies through their  mothers milk. This natural protection can last 8-14 weeks. Puppies & kittens should NOT be vaccinated at LESS than 8weeks. Maternal immunity will neutralize the vaccine and little protection (0-38%) will be produced. Vaccination at 6 weeks will, however, delay the timing of the first highly effective vaccine. Vaccinations given 2 weeks apart suppress rather than stimulate the immune  system. A series of vaccinations is given starting at 8 weeks and given 3-4 weeks apart up to 16 weeks of age.Another vaccination given sometime after 6  months of age (usually at 1 year 4mo) will provide lifetime immunity.    CURRENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR DOGS    Distemper & Parvo * "According to Dr. Schultz, AVMA, 8-15-95, when a vaccinations series given at 2, 3 & 4 months and again at 1 year with a  MLV, puppies and kitten program memory cells that survive for life,  providing lifelong immunity." Dr. Carmichael at Cornell and Dr. Schultz  have studies showing immunity against challenge at 2-10 years for canine distemper & 4 years for parvovirus. Studies for longer duration are pending.  "There are no new strains of parvovirus as one mfg. would like to suggest. Parvovirus vaccination provides cross immunity for all types."    Hepatitis (Adenovirus) is one of the agents known to be a cause of kennel cough. Only vaccines with CAV-2 should be used asCAV-1 vaccines carry the risk of  hepatitis blue-eye" reactions & kidney damage.    **Bordetella Parainfluenza: Commonly called "Kennel cough" Recommended only for those dogs boarded, groomed, taken to dog shows, or for any reason housed where exposed to a lot of dogs. The intranasal vaccine  provides more complete and more rapid onset of immunity with less chance of reaction. Immunity requires 72 hours and does not protect from every cause of kennel cough. Immunity is of short duration (4 to 6 months).*    *RABIES There have been no reported cases of rabid dogs or cats in Harris, Montogomery or Ft. Bend Counties [Texas], there have been rabid skunks and  bats so the potential exists. / It is a killed vaccine and must be given every year./*//    *Lyme disease_is a tick born disease which can cause lameness, kidney failure and heart disease in dogs. Ticks can also transmit the disease to humans. The  original Ft. Dodge killed bacteria has proven to be the most effective vaccine. Lyme disease prevention should emphasize early removal of ticks. Amitraz collars are more effective than Top Spot, as amitraz paralyzes the  tick's mouthparts preventing transmission of disease.    **VACCINATIONS NOT RECOMMENDED**  Multiple components in vaccines compete with each other for the immune system and result in lesser immunity for each individual disease as well as increasing the risk of a reaction. Canine Corona Virus is only a disease of puppies. It is rare, self limiting (dogs get well in 3 days without treatment). Cornell & Texas A&M have only diagnosed one case each in the  last 7 years. Corona virus does not cause disease in adult dogs.*    *Leptospirosis vaccine is a common caus

LRZ6Hu4saa	Most likely, especially the feeding aspect. If I'm correct that dog sees you as its leader and is showing you that he'll wait for you to eat first and let him have what's left over.|`|16XpYCBmaa	It sounds like it.
BjFat2raaa	Blue.. but a good true blue.. don't get any light colors.    Blue Otter or Black Otter would be fine too, or black. Most colors are actually fine with each other. Not like some breeds.. like Flemish Giants where you breed colors seperate.    Broken or solid. Anything you can have as a solid can be shown in a broken.. and good color is good color.. the broken pattern won't effect that (white doesn't mix with the color.. they are seperate colors that don't mix into each other).    Don't get hung up on colors so much.. except for having good colors.. get the right body in your line first.. then work on colors later.. you'll have more fun at the shows.    Minnesota Brat - She probably won't be showing the doe because she plans on having her bred with babies. After having babies Mini Rex RARELY get back to having a competitive body. French Lops do fine (I saw you were looking for the breed on another question) after having babies. I've even shown them while they were nursing.. it's a minor fault and the moms & babies don't mind so long as they aren't seperated long (12 hours for litters that are nursing a lot.. like at 2 weeks.. but the first week they can be seperated for 24 hours).|`|BM4zJ2vZaa	I would Say either a broken blue or a broken blue otter or a blue otter.  if your not going to get the blue otter doe id recommend breeding either a:    Broken black with a black otter- I tried this one and i got a white, broken black, and a broken black otter.     Broken black with a black- Might get a broken black, white, or black      Hope I helped

If you are looking for a hamster that you want to handle more and interact with a lot then a Syrian (teddy bear, black bear, golden hamster, etc.) is the best choice. They tend to be more sociable but can not be kept with other hamsters. Dwarf types of hamsters like the Chinese, Russian, and Campbells are more of a "window" pet. They would be a better choice for someone who didn't have a lot of time to spend with their hamsters. They tend not to be as sociable with humans and sometimes nip (not to say that Syrians never do). They should also be housed with another member of their species and gender. Remember that there is no guaranteed way to know what a hamster will do based upon its species alone. Everything is different from hamster to hamster.|`|pv7XYLELaa	I would say Any kind of Dwarf hamster if you're going to have more then one in the cage, just make sure they're the same breed.    Syrian hamsters are larger, and are solitary.    Roborovski hamsters are the smallest of all, and are really quick so you  might want to hold them over the cage to prevent them from taking a daring dive out of your hand and splatting on the floor    Panda hamsters look like Pandas..I don't know much about them other then they're adorable    I personally, have two Russian Dwarfs and I adore them, I would also love to get a Roborovski hamster, but I'm told they'd fight.    It's up to you, if you want a lot of hamsters look at breeds other then Syrian unless you plan on having hamster fights, and that's just wrong D:|`|MU7q5fCRaa	dwarf hamster. Definitely dwarf hamster. They are small and very cute. They can live with many different hamsters, unlike the Syrian hamster.|`|ak9DrBSwaa	Depends! Everyone has different ideas of the ideal pet and different situations.

Whh0G1eJaa	If you have a freshwater tank, take those shells out right now.  You are most likely experiencing a bacteria bloom which should clear up by itself in a few days as the bacteria are establishing themselves in the new tank.  <br>  <br>  Your 55 gallon tank needs to go through it's cycle to establish colonies of helpful bacteria.  This can take up to 6 weeks.  If your 10 gallon tank is still running, pull the filter media from it and place it in the filter of the new tank.  This will give it a running start to catch up with the bio-load in the 55.|`|SOxdyWQOaa	take the shells out and if you did not upgrade your filter you should because it's not working also take out 50% of your water out and put new water in add stress coat for the fish <br>  <br>  <br>  17 years experience with fish|`|eUf9e81eaa	By reducing the volume of the water and filling up with fresh clean water.|`|MKuDawP7aa	Nothing looks better then a crystal clear saltwater aquarium. Unfortunately many saltwater fish keepers cannot get rid of their cloudy water and never have truly crystal clear marine aquariums. The tips below will help you understand why your saltwater aquarium water is cloudy and what you can do to make it clear again.<br>  <br>  Why Saltwater Fish Tank Water Gets Cloudy<br>  <br>  There are two main reasons that your saltwater fish tank water will be cloudy. Those two reasons are bacterial blooms and excessive debris in your water<br>  <br>  The bacterial blooms are the direct result of over feeding your fish or over stocking your tank. The excess waste that to many fish and rotting fish food produce will break down and will feed the bacteria.<br>  <br>  To much debris in the water usually comes from filters that are not strong enough or not cleaned frequently enough to do a good job.<br>  <br>  <br>  or try for freshwater:<br>  <br>  First examine the amount of fish you have in your tank. You should really only have one average size fish for every 8-10 gallons of tank volume. If you have alot more then this you may need to remove one or two saltwater fish to get the stocking levels back within an acceptable range.<br>  <br>  Also make sure to shut off all pumps and filters when you feed and add your fish and add food slowly. This will give the fish the best chance at getting all the food and it will not be blown around.<br>  <br>  Take a look at your filter system as well and make sure the filters you have are rated for the tank size you have. If they are to small you may need to upgrade to larger more efficient filters.<br>  <br>  Make sure to clean your filters at least every two weeks to get rid of trapped debris and fish waste that can add to bacterial blooms. You may need to clean them more frequently if they are slightly underpowered.<br>  <br>  Keeping the water in your fish tank clean is a priority for any Aquarist. Despite water looking clean it may not be safe for fish to live in and can ultimately kill them. Thus water should be tested and replaced on a regular basis. You may notice at times that the water becomes unusually cloudy. This may cause you some concern that your fish may be in danger and that you can't see what's going on in the fish tank. This article will examine what causes cloudy fish tank water. Why and how it occurs and how to treat it.<br>  <br>  The most common cause of cloudy water is what is known as bacterial bloom. Bacterial bloom is when there is an explosive growth in the numbers of bacteria in the fish tank. Bacterial colonies develop in response to nutrients in the water. These nutrients are often excess food, fish excrement or plant debris. The bacteria act as a filtration device in the tank to remove these waste products and make the water safe for fish to live in. When the bacterial growth occurs the water will appear cloudy or milky.<br>  <br>  Bacterial bloom can occur when the tank is new. It occurs when the tank is new because there is an imbalance in the level of nutrients in the water to the levels of bacteria. This may be because there are too many fish in the tank. As you go through starting up a new aquarium the level of nutrients to bacteria will stabilize and the cloudiness should dissipate.<br>  <br>  If the water becomes cloudy in an established aquarium then it might be because the filtration process has broken down or that you are putting too much food into the tank.<br>  <br>  To remove the cloudiness you can do a few things.<br>  <br>  You can wait for the tank to become established.<br>  <br>  You could add a bacteria starter that will help to process the waste.<br>  <br>  You can do a partial water change of 10-20% .<br>  <br>  Bacterial bloom is generally not harmful to the aquatic life in the tank so the cloudiness of the water is more detrimental to the viewing of the tank than anything else. Having said this it is always a good idea to test the fish tank water regularly (as part of a weekly water change for example) for any pollutants so that you can take any remedial action necessary.|`|kwc2thM9aa	change the water completly
z9K1Pen6aa	hi.  the guppy is just having mood swings. its like ladies when we get pregnant. they have mood swings and she just wants to be alone. try putting her with a fish her size so she doesnt feel like a undersized fish. Also try giving her more food scince she has more fishies inside her.:]|`|fxH6T7vCaa	Its some times goes on the tem. of the tank, turn the heat up a little. Also guppys have the ability to store sperms so she can have then how ever they want whenever they want. And sorry to say this, but the mom or another guppy probebly ate the one baby you were talking about.|`|Fx9bxZ8aaa	she will have the next fry in a couple of seconds.sometimes 2 come out at the same time.she can have all of them in less than a minute.she is acting like that because she is giving birth.they would do anything to protect their selves.they get aggressive when they are aggressive.it is normal so don't worry.they do it every time they get pregnant.the baby that dissapeared can be hiding in the tank.since they are so small they fit anywhere.or it can be eaten by it's parent or other fish in the tank.|`|aeUjAvTuaa	Hey! Okay it takes about 24 hours for all babies to be born. The mother fish is only trying to scare the other fish away and since she's pregnant she doesn't want other fish near her. There are two reasons why that baby just disappeared. One-is because it is trying to hide from the other fish so it doesn't get eaten. Two-is because guppies are known to eat their own babies|`|SKkb4xNiaa	may be the baby fish is hide very good or bad news she is eating them and that's why she is kind of angry and don't want to eat but she do want to eat her own babies. Sometimes females have this behavior of being aggressive to all of the fish on the tank.Probably this behavior could be from her pregnancy or just because she is not in a mode|`|ado8DHr7aa	First of all, if you have a pregnant guppy shes going to be pregnant again, and again and again. It happened to me, and I swear I was going crazy there were so many babies.     Just so you know the babies will probably be eaten by other fish, or the mom after birth so they should be in a divider, or another tank. The mom should be separated also because she could hurt herself or get hurt by other fish with in the birthing process. You should provide low plants that have many hiding holes for the babies to be born in. They eat some baiy fish 'dust' also that you will need to get from a pet store.     But really, I would get rid of the pregnant fish because you are going to regret it so much when you have 20 or 30 babies fish everywhere. I would freeze the mom in a ziplock bag so she goes through the least stress
lhOd2hvXaa	Yes, onions can be toxic to dogs.  Feeding dogs either raw or cooked onions can cause them to develop hemolytic anemia.    Don't feed a dog onion or garlic.|`|RN1wGlWWaa	Yes, it can cause blood problems (anemia).  Onions should NEVER be given in any form to a dog or cat.|`|SMFhXxcfaa	that's funny, I was just talking to a vet tech about onions and dogs.  She said they are poisonous.  So don't feed your dog onions!|`|MXp3Lh0taa	Yes they are extremely toxic to a dog. You should never feed this to your dogs.|`|5b697ae5264bc19d33f3ae5c96b9fb0caa	Why would you feed an onion to a dog? This is one thing your not suppose to feed to a dog! Dogs are carnivorous animals. They love meat. You need to only feed the food made for dogs. They are not suppose to eat table scraps|`|16XpYCBmaa	Yes they are bad for dogs. Raisins are bad too and so is chocolate.
Mcf33eLbaa	Do nothing and just wait and see as it was clearly her fault for having her dog off leash in a community that has a leash law.  Chances are she is aware of it and will just take her own dog to the vet if needed and will never say a thing considering that she more than likely does not want to be charged for it.  If the police or ASPCA does come to you simply explain what occured.  Good Luck and God Bless|`|K2jT1z5jaa	Since the law was : On leash. You cant get charged for anything.     You could actually charge her . For having dog off leash putting you in danger and your dog.  Whilst your dog was on leash. By law you are in the clear. She isnt.   So she is most likely more worried that you will charge her.    She cant  charge you for your dog acting in defence for itself and owner. from an animal that was off leash and not being controlled by owner.  Talk / email your council if you wish. If not. Wait until she says something. because she really cant say anything. But if you do want her charged. then yes complain.    God Bless x|`|K8qMighsaa	um so like why are you even worried? did the old bat, i mean "nice lady" threaten to report you or something? just let it go, and since you know your dog gets provoked and tends to bite when angered, try to keep him on a "short leash" and look ahead of you when walking down the street, to make sure no dogs are coming toward you off their leash. if you feel she might report you, go on over to the police or contact the aspca and mention it, maybe file a report, just to protect yourself and your pooch. best of luck.|`|SMFhXxcfaa	talk to the local animal control or police and see what they say about it.  I don't think anything could be charged on you if your dog was on leash.|`|7WUvPI8maa	you don't have anything to worry about whether she decides to do anything or not. because her dog was not on a leash, it would be her fault esp. since you have the leash law.
6be65543422b4937c27d1761a2ed50a0aa	This is something that should be examined by your vet.  If it's "nothing", then antibiotics should clear it up in no time.  HOWEVER, if it's a cancerous growth, the longer you wait to get it treated, the more extensive and EXPENSIVE the treatment will be.    Also, if it IS cancerous, it needs to be removed ASAP.......and hope it hasn't spread.......    Hope this helps, and you get her examined ASAP.....Good luck.|`|4TX26viFaa	Rodent ulcer most likely.

ak9DrBSwaa	Dish soap isn't going to kill your hamster. White vinegar also works well. At times, like in the case of an illness, it may even be necessary to bleach your cage. Whatever you use to clean it be sure it is rinsed THOUROUGHLY so that no odor from the cleaning product remains.     Setting the cage in the sunshine after cleaning is also helpful - never with the hamsters in it though!|`|lLQunBRaaa	DO NOT USE SOAP. unless you want to kill your hamster. use a sponge and really hot water first. then use cold water to get rid of the smell. vinegar? i guess could work because it's not soap. but don't use soap.|`|f633886f4ab9993e966868c8e49ab87baa	yeah, that's better so when your hamster bites it's cage it won't get poisoned by soap.|`|yQIOXv5Yaa	regular water works just fine and is safer than the others.|`|ZCBotgcIaa	Regular water DOES work.

f7CufkSyaa	i raised chickens for over twenty years and to my knowledge no. the hens are afected by light. thats why egg producers will turn on the lights early and keep the lights on after dark. then hens are instinctive to the days getting longer for spring and will lay earlier with the artificial stimulus of the lights. some thing to do with raising their chicks and having a longer day so they can find more food. its all about nature.  also feeding them the good nutricious diet and oyster shell for added calcium is also a big benefit. keep in mind different breeds of fowl vary in how much egg production you get.
d87b4fac7f53e9dd399f4663d9097055aa	There are several options available for you. Keep in mind if you want to use one that also includes heartworm prevention, you need to have the dog tested for heartworms prior to giving the medication.  If you have no problems with ticks, that narrows your choice even further.  The following are some of the medications available.    Revolution (topical): heartworms, fleas, ear mites, sarcoptic mange    Advantix (topical): fleas, ticks, mosquito    Comfortis (tablet): fleas only    Advantage (topical): fleas only    Advantage Multi (topical): heartworm, fleas, hookworms, roundworms, whipworms.

It's what I use on my 5lb yorkie after he had a very severe reaction to Frontline. I will never use it or recommend it again.    ONLY use things you can get from your vet. The ones at Wal-Mart (ex. Hartz) can be harmful and fatal to your animals.|`|09ybdL8Caa	I use "Comfortis"  It's an oral flea treatment. It does not prevent fleas from getting on your dog but kills them after they bite. Starts working in 30 minutes. Works great. Good price. Palatable. Soon your dog will have no fleas. Kills off all fleas very quickly! You can google it for more information. My friend fosters dogs and owns several of her own. Most of the dogs she gets are infested with fleas but once she puts them on Comfortis the problem is no longer a problem. Look it up, try it, you'll like it.
ltP1gO4taa	Pick up your dirty clothes!  I can't imagine that your dog's saliva is making your underwear smell that bad.  If your dog's breath smells like ammonia you need to get him to a vet.  Ammonia is a smell normally associated with urine.  Are you sure he's not peeing on it?  Or do you have a cat?    I don't mean to be offensive, but have you compared the smell to any non-chewed underwear?  Unless he's urinating on it I think it might be in your head.|`|syT3XUAraa	My dog does the same thing, but it sounds like yours may have urinated on them. I would suggest using any sort of urine remover cleaners for the clothes, some training for the dog, and maybe talking to your daughter about leaving the door open sometimes (if she's old enough to know better).|`|OnZDg0AEaa	hi,    Like many undesirable canine behaviors, destructive habits usually develop because a dog is bored, lonely, or both. It's not fair or realistic to expect your dog--especially a working breed --to spend long hours quietly sitting and waiting for your return. By nature dogs are curious and sentient beings; see that she has enough mental and physical stimulation to minimize the impulse to dig and chew.  here's a treatment:  http://www.mediumurl.com/?r=506543472631...    hope this helps.|`|xOwHCc0waa	I have nothing to recommend for the smell of your "garments", but you could install a "doggie fence" in front of your bedroom door, or put a sign on the inside of the door saying "Don't forget to close and lock!!"|`|RRZtsSKuaa	Try oxyclean.  The powder- it comes in a small tub with a green lid.  It gets any smell out of anything.  I can't see that it "boosts" the brightness like it claims to, but it is GREAT to get out strange smells.|`|BhXOLas1aa	An ammonia scent does not come from a dogs mouth, it usually comes from it's urine.  Why not ensure that you and your daughter leave a few nice toys in your bed rooms for him to pay with an keep you underwear etc: in drawers that your dog cannot access?  Try soaking in a little washing soda first and then use a biological washing powder or liquid.  I have had over 15 dogs in my life and have never had this problem, it my be worth checking this with your vet as it sounds most unusual to me and may be that your dog has an illness.  Good luck and best wishes|`|Y3aK2xDHaa	It sounds to me like he is urinating on the garments as well,  If you smell ammonia. How old is the dog?  Personally, I would start putting him in a crate when he does it so that he understands what hes doing is wrong.|`|a4bb647918f2c3ff644ea051b8834ef7aa	buy new underwear.

I would say you would need to give them one on one attention for around an hour each day. They are very easy to train as long as they have been hand reared.

N1ay8hzFaa	I don't have an answer to that specific question, but I just recently learned that there are medications that you give to cats or dogs that reduce the amount of dander they produce. Dander is mainly what causes the reaction. You might look into that. Good luck!
gKGROtYSaa	My dog does that too.  She's so cute.  She does that because she wants something - to go out, or a treat.  Usually she wants to go out when we return.|`|4tFuosueaa	Your dog must be a retriever or a retriever mix. I used to have three Golden Retrievers and they all did that.

You have to have it a while. Even when you are able to start doing those types of things, you will only be able to take it for short walks at first. You have to build up to longer walks. AND your dog always has to take 30 min breaks in between walks. Always make sure you take care and play with your dog daily. It may run away if you don't. Don't worry, you'll be able to do those things in time.
25660b99958e6df83f2c651134b3891faa	it is instinct for them to issue a distress cry. they do this when hungry, need to go to the bathroom,cold, or just lonely. mom does everything for them, so they scream a lot.  at this age, if you try to comfort them, they scream, because instinct tells them you are not mom, so they scream for help thinking they are being attacked by a predator.  assuming the vet told you how to help them go to the bathroom, put a heating pad, set on low with a towel on it, covering half of a box. this allows them to crawl off it if too hot.  a stuffed animal with a hot water bottle in it works too.  you can try sleeping with them, let them snuggle up to you.    they miss mom, they are not old enough to see or walk, so they are scared.    and you English is fine. not perfect, but understandable.|`|6be65543422b4937c27d1761a2ed50a0aa	Are you stimulating them to poop/pee?  This very necessary, and must be done after EVERY feeding.  If you can't get them to eat using a pet nurser, try getting a syringe without a needle, and letting them suck the milk out of that.  Don't try to squirt it in their mouths, or you take a chance on DROWNING them.     When you got the milk at the vets, did they show you HOW to feed the kittens?  There's a right way and a wrong way......and if they "weren't hungry", you may have been doing it wrong.  Kittens are USUALLY hungry!!  They need to eat every 2-3 hours AROUND THE CLOCK....for another week.....then can be fed at longer intervals.    Also, they need to be in a box with something to keep them warm...Kittens can't regulate their bowels OR their body heat.  A lamp shining down on the box will help keep them "toasty".......60W bulb ... 3 ft over box.  Kittens that are continually mewling, are usually COLD......    If you have some kind of "plush" toy animal, you can put that in the box with them, so they'll have something to "cuddle" up against.    You've taken on a BIG responsibility.  I hope it works out for ALL of you.........Good luck.|`|p5CrZ5Bwaa	Its normal for that at nite they like 2 play or just meow when they get older like when there a month old they will pla with you all nite and do they have there parents because they like 2 meow when they dont and maybe U should get a toy cat (like a fake cat) and have it with them when they sleep|`|48qIS5veaa	theyre acting this way becuase they want their mom. Their old enough to know you are NOT their mom. I know this sounds weird, but try putting out a stuffed animal cat. Have a dog or other cat? they might cling to the other animal. No worries, though, if they keep acting this way, the vet might have a simple fix. Good luck. I had 10 kittens, but with their mother, and they meowed alot too. I think its just in their nature. Once again, good luck.|`|j2yHX3mOaa	So sorry too hear about your sad story, as far as the kittens meowing a lot, obviously they are missing mum, try mimicking mums heart beat in their bed with a ticking clock also hot water bottle under the bedding might help tricking them that its mum.|`|RWgjnwl9aa	Pa t a towel in a box when you put kitties in & put a couple of stuff animals too  squirt some KRP (kitten replacement milk) on the stuff animals they'll smell it & want to cuddle close  after feeding take a cloth of some kind & stimulate rectum vigorously so the eliminate the mom does this it's natural OK a bit of advice when you go to bed keep box in your room they'll have your scent too &  feel more secure they'll need shots at about 8wks & be de-wormed too they get worms from Mom Good Luck You're a great person doing this

RUxRNsf4aa	Im not exactly POSITIVE, but i believe it has to do with the tree when it was shredded. I know that pine stumps that have red rings on them show that they were "drinking" or drawing up water when they were cut. That is probably what it is, or that the same effect occured when your horse "went" there, and it makes the same color when the shavings are wet. That is my theory.|`|8ITLTuNtaa	Usually becuase the urine has changed the colour of the wood :D|`|Pm8nsCGZaa	Simply... like the 1st answer.  It's in the urine.  When the shavings get soaked, they turn orange-ish.  Molecular activity  :-)|`|5TCewPYRaa	It depends on how urine-saturated the shavings are---if they are a very light colour, they can still absorb much more urine and can be left in---if they are the very dark red or brown, they should've been taken out a while ago....    It also depends on how strong the horses urine is---some horses have really acidic pee and others have very watery pee--in which case the shavings will turn different colours      My rule for taking the shavings out is if they are a bright orangey colour---if they are very lightly stained, then they don't smell bad (the pine covers up the smell) and aren't amitting ammonia into the air so they can be left in until the next stall cleaning...if you take all the pee out everytime you are simply wasting shavings as they can absorb much more and as long as you put fresh shavings over top, the horse is not standing on them and the smell is covered up---not a big deal at all...no bad health effects for the horse at all...|`|PEPWFGNGaa	Chemical reaction between urine in air contact and shavings. ( You may also notice that it smells differently)|`|d5hWW6b0aa	Red is when it has absorbed urine and its normal color is is when it has not. If its wet and and clear its water.|`|ECgFNEWjaa	According to Robert Oglesby DVM this is caused by phyto (plant) pigments in the urine reacting to the air.  The same reaction can be seen on snow, too.|`|byDK7cM6aa	well wood is light and has a red color when u get towards to the middle of it so that and the urine of horse|`|SK4qj3ZEaa	I think it depends on the kind of wood.  It may also depend on if the wood was close to the bark on the tree.  If the bark on a tree is cut off the wood directly underneath appears reddish wood. It it tree is cut more it is more of a tan.  I am just guessing it is just something I notice when we had some tree cut down.  Go find a fallen branch and peel off some bark you should see red.  Snap it in half and see tan.  However this may only work on some trees.|`|a2rNEBShaa	I have had this happen to me numerous amounts of times its nothing to worry about It is a natural thing for horses to pee orage/red when they have eaten different foods or drank different amounts of water. Its just like humans. Don't fret you can't really fix it and it will most likely stop but will come back. Its harmless so don't worry over it too much. Hope I am of help!|`|7B3RTyrsaa	It is probably because of the urine, it changes over time and usually if it sits over a day or two it becomes very red like you said. It is probably the missed spots that were not found while mucking the stalls.|`|HJcyrvHXaa	I asked my trainer that same exact question. She actually asked her vet why that was and they told her that it was because some horses have different acidity levels in their urine. So the urine acidity levels react differently to the bedding. So horses with higher acidity levels shavings may be darker red whereas horses with low acidity may be hardly there at all or shades of orange.
v0RsFaAzaa	He may have passed it, but if you see blood, something probably got punctured inside, in the process of passing it! You should take him to the vet to be on the safe side.

This means they stay in the snake's system for quite awhile.  So, even though you only have two injections left and your python doesn't seem any better, the antibiotics will continue to stay in his system.  Wait a few days after you finish the injections.

x8Vgu6acaa	1.  Does she know for a fact that he continues barking after she leaves.  Have her set up surveillance.  Maybe a neighbor who is home to listen to see if he stops.    I ask this because my dog goes nuts when I leave.  But as soon as I drive away she stops.  She also starts back barking when I come home.  She can hear my car down the block.  If I didn't know the truth it would seem that she was barking the whole time.      She can call the rescue.  Many times they have trainers that are willing to help with issues because they want the dog to be successful.  There are also, citranella and sound aversion bark collars available.  I am not against shock collars if they are used as a last resort and under the supervision of an experienced trainer.    Add:  If misused, she could be creating more stress in the dog that may result in other unwanted behaviors.    ADD:  Since she is adamant about using this collar.  The only thing I can think of is to try to convince her to hire an experienced trainer to help her use it properly.  The trainer should be able to assess whether a different approach will work better for her dogs situation.  If not then the trainer can teach her the proper use of the collar.    My concern is that if the dog is barking out of some sort of seperation anxiety, then shocking the dog will make it even more anxious.  Thereby creating more (and maybe worse) unwanted behaviors.|`|aCqSF87Raa	First off, there is nothing wrong with e-collars so long as they are used PROPERLY and at the discretion of a trainer. Many people use them to train field and/or hunting (working) dogs with high sucess.    What is it you have against them? Have you done research, talked to trainers? Don't diss a method of training unless you have the research to back you up.    What dogs should not wear them:  -Young dogs (under a year old) because puppies are very impressionable and the collar may make behavior problems worse.   -Dogs that are going to be left alone at all because the owner should be around in case the collar shorts out or something goes wrong (IE box gets stuck on crate.)  - Dogs whose owners have not tried OTHER options.    E-Collars do not hurt if on the correct level. They provide static discomfort and literally startle the dog out of the current behavior. I tested the collar on myself (on my forearm) before putting it on my dog and i've felt worse falling and scraping my knees as a kid.    However i do agree that she should try other options before going e-collar. Dogs usually stop whining after a while - there's a chance the pup stops while she is gone and starts when he hears her return.     There are other ways of correcting this: ultrasonic correction (automatically sends out an irritating noise when the dog barks) for one. Exercising before crate time will also wear the dog out and may help.|`|mwVCFlLTaa	A great resources is www.trulydogfriendly.com which has a trainer list and a large number of training related articles, several of which are specifically about shock collars.|`|vRPRLLYpaa	they. are. horrible|`|2697c1729e017f780327da8beda5c294aa	Okay , so dog from the shelter lets get the history on the dog, Wait your friends description gave it to us.   First off Where is the kennel?  Lets get a dog throw it in the apartment and see what it does.. Where is the schedule? do you know dogs feel secure where there is a routine in the home? What routine is there for the dog. Secondly, I applaud her for saving a dog, however the dogs history is going to hinder what she is doing now.      Bottom line professional trainer, or tell your friend get the dog in some obedience's classes, She needs to work with the dog get leader ship with the dog and go from there,     The reason why I say this is ,,,, The dog has no security at this point .|`|HhmhSBpgaa	Mean!!! But effective. But still Mean!|`|c0f1359c19efc31ad29e3e86f3ebefc3aa	Some dogs will stop barking eventually, others will not. A shock collar will be FAR less cruel than having to give the dog up because she can't stop the barking.   Used correctly, shock collare are NOT a cruel device. As a trainer, I have used them to save MANY dog's lives. Anything can be used incorrectly to abuse a dog. Shock collars cause absolutely no damage to the dog, it is simply an adjustable sensation (unlike choce, pinch or even flat collars). Go speak with a trainer that really understands how to correctly apply an e-collar to training and you will see just how easily and painlessely the device can be used.|`|zWBYxMvWaa	Shock collars are okay on low settings.

It should NEVER be used when the dog is not supervised nor should it be used by the novice trainer that doesn't know how to properly use one. They aren't cruel when used properly but they are also not a cure all and will only cause the dog to stop barking while it is on. The better way to do this is to make sure the dog is tired when he goes in there. A good long walk in the morning would tire him out so he'd go in there for a rest and actually look forward to the rest. Leaving on a radio so he doesn't feel so alone can help as well.|`|BWtjfkCdaa	shock collars are just plain mean and i mean when if someone is tryin to break in to your house! your dog can't bark to warn you!|`|ydshiNrKaa	Try leaving on the tv or a radio so he won't think he's alone. This works really well for my dog in staying calm when he is alone in the house.  You could try and give the dog more exercise before she leaves so the dog is tired and will sleep when she leaves.
vvJBtxXHaa	The following is an alternative method you might consider that will cure ich and treat the fish's wounds instead of the use of the chemical "malychite green"    ....in addition to gently raising the temperature to ~85F, and add salt (i defer to TIKITIKI's solution of salt) to the warmer water for15 to 21 days  ...slowly bring up the temp ~2 degrees each day  to up above 85F   ....the temp increase will do two things:       1. speed up the reproduction cycle of the ich spores, the life cycle of ich takes 12 to 16 days to complete       2. ich tomites do very poorly at 85F  ....also, as a sanitation procedure, continue water changes every 3 days of 25% to wash out as many spores as possible  ....avoid larger water changes to avoid drastic ph shifting  ...always replace water using ~tepid-tap-water, similar to the tank temp, dechlorinated of course, and pre-salted, using non-iodized NaCl salt...the type for freshwater aquariums (assuming you are set up as freshwater)  ..the salt helps heal the wounds from ich  (....NaCl is not to be confused with marine buffering salt which should not be used in freshwater set ups)|`|PlBHhU3Kaa	its ich           http://www.petsolutions.com/Ich-Guard+I4...  http://www.petsolutions.com/Aquarisol+I4...  http://www.petsolutions.com/Aquazole+I10...  http://www.petsolutions.com/Ich-Guard-II...  http://www.petsolutions.com/Maracide+I84...  http://www.petsolutions.com/Super-Ich-Cu...    or you can get it from a local pet store|`|Fx9bxZ8aaa	the best treatment is probably API.whitespots are called ich.all you have to do is raise the water temperature and use medication for 10-15 days.you also need to discontinue the carbon filteration during the treatment.there is no need to do large water changes,but you will have to do some water changes during the treatment.|`|3bf821ff353c216ffc93ff7a91b60828aa	Here's a few links that give you different options.  It also explains the causes of ich, and exactly what it is, and what it can be difficult to treat if not done right.  I personally prefer the heat/salt method to the chemical products.  Also keep in mind, a lot of fish are sensitive to those meds, and some to salt as well-tetras, loaches, cory cats, plecos, other catfish, any scaleless fish.      http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ichthyophth...    http://www.peteducation.com/article.cfm?...    http://www.skepticalaquarist.com/docs/he...    With the salt/heat method, do a water change being sure to vacuum the gravel and decorations really good.  Add 1 tablespoon of salt per 5 US gallons to some buckets-and dissolve.  Add that to the tank.  Slowly over the course of the day increase the tank temp to about 84F.  The heat makes the ich life cycle go quicker, the salt is supposed to kill the ich off during it's free swimming stage.  Treat for about 3 weeks, or for at least 4 days after you see the last spot on the fish fall off.  And, salt does not evaporate, it's only removed from the water via water changes.  So, if you remove 5 gallons of water, only replace 1 tablespoon of salt....very important to remember so you don't end up with too much salt in your tank.    If you go the route of medications instead, be sure to do more research.  Some of those meds should not be used with lights on, and some you don't want to increase the heat in the tank either.  That third link should give you a better idea of that.      .|`|AA11043433	I have treated whitespot without any fish dying by the following method:-  soon as you see the spots bring the temp of the tank up 32c and overnight the parasites all dropped off  I then removed the fish and put them in a clean tank.  I then did a complete water change in the first tank and filled it with near boiling water and then put filter and heater back in and turned it up full for 24 hours, the parasite can not live in over 85 f and can not live if it doesnt attatch to a fish in 24 hrs from the free swimming stage so even if there are any that survive the water change the hot water then they will have nothing to feed off. 3 days later I did another water change and brought the temp up to the normal 28c and put the fish back in.  No fish died and the whitespot never returned and that was 10 months ago.  Oh the only med used was malafix to stop any secondry infections from the holes that the whilespot cause by burrowing into the fish. I used it for a week.  The trick to whitespot is to know your enemy...it's life cycle is predictable and that is it's weakness. Don't panic it wasn't a killer for me and my fish.|`|67sfOVbZaa	I have used the Interpet WhiteSpot Treatment before and as long as you follow the instructions properly and for the specified time i found that it worked a treat!|`|ZktjgoeNaa	What you want to do is turn your temperature up to about 82 degrees and medicate.

RFfTjnxzaa	$100 is pretty good for a Bichon. Go check out the pups and the breeders. But that really is one hell of a deal.    Females have an estrus cycle (heat) twice a year. This will attract all the male dogs around (neutered males included). You will have to try to keep her on your property so you don't spread the smell around.    Males basically have no cons. Un-neutered males don't necessarily mark in the house (improperly housebroken dogs do that, no matter how neutered they are), start fights, or roam.    Links to info about the breed are below.|`|GyS7mHBVaa	wow my aunt got 1 for 1000 dollars sounds like a good deal just make sure nothing is wrong with it they have a snappy bark   but a great lap dog and the softest puffy fur|`|mC8iwbVCaa	yesss, !  ive heard that they are VERY expensive ,  so $100 is worth it.  and girl's are always cuute. :D  you could dress them up and stuff! |`|NJfpY7nIaa	No, go adopt a dog from a shelter/rescue.|`|pGYT94Zzaa	I have one and HELL do it thats a GOOD deal!!!

The dog better be up-to-date on shots and vet examinations and spayed/neutered if at the appropriate age.  However, if it is from an obvious breeder (go to their home and check the place out), don't.  You'll just support BYB.  Do realize that this dog isn't top-of-the-line quality, so it may have genetic issues common to the breed.  With that in mind, go for it.|`|3WzGf8tJaa	If you want, just don't expect a Mercedes Benz for a clunker price.  I have seen registered dogs that look nothing like its breed standard.  I would be concerned about health and temperment issues.|`|LfZk2NGBaa	It sounds like you are not familiar with the breed. Understand that while 100 is inexpensive for one, you will be spending over 45 every 4-6 weeks for grooming. They must be groomed just like many breeds of dogs. They also require a lot of brushing if you can not keep up with the coat, you will be spending well over you 100 investment at a groomers.|`|OFpl236faa	The smaller dogs tend to bark more and are harder to potty train. Bichon's can also have a nuber of health issues. I would ask the people if their dogs have been tested for any genetic problems. Do they have a contract or health gaurantee? Just something to look into and if something happens, will they take the dog back? If the answer is yes to all of these, then these are responsible breeders. Usually people in the paper are just back yard breeders so be careful.    Some more info on the breed.  http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/bichonfrise....    I personally like boys better. They are generally easier to potty train, get along better with other dogs and are more laid back. Girls can sometimes be snarky. I would also spay/nueter to make it easier to care and train your new pet. Good luck with your decision. You can always look into rescue too!|`|rXMTdUg4aa	If you have to ask then no.

I can't believe you found one for $100 that is nice!     DESCRIPTION  A charming white powerful that loves children, the Bichon Frise is a small dog with loosely curled double-coated hair that is 3-4 inches long, and is virtually less hypoallergenic than other breeds. With a moderate muzzle that is not sharp or pointed, its bite is one of scissor, and has beautiful quizzical eyes that are dark and intelligent with well-covered hanging ears. The breed has a long neck and a well-developed chest, with a cute little plumed tail curled over its back.     The Bichon has a powder-buff appearance that is not only striking but derives from its double coat. This special coat has a double purpose, which is a soft and dense coat on the top with a coarser coat, with a "poodle" curly look until it is groomed. The double coat causes the fur to stand up, springing back when it is patted or touched. With a build that is longer than tall, the breeds quickly starts out with an effortless trot that is beautiful to behold-which was how it began in the show rings and as performers in their early development days. With no gross or incapacitating exaggerations, there is no inherent reason for any lack of balance or even unsound movements. If this is seen, the puppy has something wrong with it, and should not be purchased.     In the 1980s, the Bichon Frise was part of the "Yuppie Puppies" choice of the majority population, and everyone just HAD to have one. Due to this, over-breeding occurred with less experienced breeders or back-yard breeders who paid no attention to the higher quality traits, mingling all levels of the Bichon genetic lines. When purchasing ones, make sure you get personal references on the parents and previous litters out of that line before choosing.    COAT  The Bichon Frise has a double coat, consisting of a curly outer coat with loose hair and a soft, silky undercoat. This double coat keeps the dog warm in the winter and cool in the summer. But good grooming is required once shedding begins, as the undercoat needs to be removed once the weather begins to warm up or excessive shedding will leave piles of hair throughout the home.     Many people, instead of grooming their dog or having them professionally done, will shave the hair off completely in order to keep the dog cool in the summer. But what they do not know is that the hair being removed is what cools down the dog's body. Once this protective layer of hair is gone, the dog will become more susceptible to the sun, wind, and bugs. Shedding treatments, such as Furminator, help keep the extra undercoat cleaned out, so hair will not get all over the furniture or routine grooming--which is always better as it becomes bonding time for the owner and the dog.    TEMPERMANT  The temperament of the Bichon Frise is sweet, perky, bouncy, active, and very playful with sporadic bursts of energy that leads them into many unknown adventures--usually beyond the fenced in yard or when they get loose from the leash, even though they are considered to be gentle creatures. High on the playfulness range, along with friendliness toward strangers, watchdog ability, and grooming requirements-anyone who purchases the Bichon will be a powder-puff challenge, to say the least!    They are one of the very few smaller dogs that get along well with children of all ages in addition to adults, and are completely hypoallergenic for those with allergies. This is a favorite breed for those desiring a "happy-go-lucky" pet with an attitude toward the world, even to strangers, pets, other dogs, and the garbage man or mailman! A sensitive dog whose feelings get hurt easily, it is the breed who's favorite past time is to cuddle up in someone's lap, especially someone who appreciates the Bichon's sensitivity, responsiveness, and affectionate behaviors.     An independent dog, the Bichon Frise bond well with adults and children and is also very highly intelligent, affectionate, charming, and self-assured. One of the few smaller breeds that is not a "yapper," even though it barks a lot due to its watchdog ability, and loves all human company. It can be shown either trimmed as a poodle or longhaired with clippings at the feet and muzzle, with requiring trimming for a rounded appearance. Easy to train and used as watchdogs, performing tricks, extremely sociable with everyone and everything-this competitive and obedient breed is a joy to have around. The only thing that may provide difficulty is its housebreaking, which has been known to occur with most smaller breeds as they need to toilet more often and are harder to watch in the home. And as usual, this has a lot to do with the trainer or owner and how they train. Absolutely all dogs and puppies can be trained, but not all trainers and owners can train properly    The major concern for the Bichon Frise is the patellar luxation, or when the kneecap is out of place. This will cause the dog to cause lameness, refuse to bear weight, or the knee|`|AA10232635	I love dogs and it took be a while to get my new puppy which came with a price of $899 but i personally think $100 is suspiciously low . a dog can be trained not to bark but just a little warning dogs are VERY hard to train but there is also many training classes to attend so my answer is no keep looking or else ask the person about vet visits  or any vaccinations these are a must.i have a girl puppy  GIRL:  have there period but it can be fixed with a trip to the vet   Boy:   pee like 3X or more the amount girls do just to mark there territory         so my answer is No, keep looking   p.s it also seems like you need to do some research on this breed|`|GuLyWRdRaa	yorkie, I wish I had a a bichon frise.|`|P8Q39vA4aa	let me say no, and BYB puppy mill alert.

uBFhKXgHaa	You're going to want to put your cat on a high quality wet/canned food. Wet food has far less carbohydrates in it than dry so it makes weight loss easier, plus it's healthier for cats anyway.    The reason is, in the wild, cats normally get most of their water content directly from their prey items and drink very little. Domestic cats are no different, and because of the fact that they are designed to take in water with their meal, they have a very low thirst drive. Cats often just don't drink enough. This leads to urinary tract infections and crystals. The bit about dry food being better for teeth is a myth and has not been proven in the least (cats barely even chew their dry food and, really, does a pretzel clean /your/ teeth? Cats should have their teeth brushed with cat toothbrushes and cat toothpaste at least a few times a week as well as see the vet for dental cleanings when necessary /regardless/ of what they are being fed). Canned/wet food is better because it more closely mimics the cat's natural diet. More on why canned food is best:  http://www.catinfo.org/  (Excellent cat nutrition information by a vet)  http://cats.about.com/cs/catfood/a/canne... (Canned Cat Food: Can Your Cat Afford to Live Without it?)  http://www.littlebigcat.com/index.php?ac... (Why Cats Need Canned Food)  http://www.felinefuture.com/nutrition/bp... (The Dry Food Crisis)  http://maxshouse.com/feline_nutrition.ht... (Max's House: Feline Nutrition)    Another option to get cats to drink more would be a cat fountain. Cats tend to like to drink from running water and cat fountains see to that need, encouraging cats to take in more water.    Definitely switch away from Purina. Purina is a crappy,  low quality cat food. I'd switch to a higher quality one. A high quality cat food also won't have as many carbohydrates and grains in it, making weight loss easier.    Examples of low quality foods to avoid: Anything you can find in a grocery store will be low end, Purina, Iams, Eukanuba, Science Diet, Royal Canin, Whiskas, Fancy Feast, Friskies, Meow Mix.    Examples of high quality foods to look for: Innova, Wellness, Solid Gold, Felidae, Fromm Four Star, Merrick, GO Natural, Nature's Variety Prairie, Nature's Logic, Artemis Fresh Mix, Timber Wolf Organics.    You could even go entirely grain free. Diets high in grain/carbohydrates have been attributed to problems with diabetes in cats. Many of the high quality foods now put out grainless formulas. Some good grainless diets include: Innova EVO, Wellness CORE, Blue Wilderness, Nature's Variety Instinct, Orijen, Horizon Legacy, Merrick Before Grain, Fromm Surf & Turf, Now!, Sold Gold Indigo Moon, Ziwipeak, and Taste of the Wild.    Since you're freefeeding... STOP. This is the fast lane to feline obesity. Read the feeding guidelines on your cat's food and feed accordingly. Adult cats are typically fed two meals a day. You may need to feed your cats separately so that they don't overeat on each other's foods.    Lastly, you want to keep your cat active. Get your cat engaged in games and playtime!      Darksong~|`|7y0eanLlaa	first get them a bowl each with 2 sections,feed in the morning 1/4 tin meat food and 1 cup dry each with plenty of clean cold water available then 12hrs later the other 1/4 each and just top up the dry mix back to 1 cup amount this is now a balanced diet and you should start to see some weight come of..hope this helps.|`|LfZk2NGBaa	You need to measure the amount and feed at the same time everyday. If one cat over eats the other cat will be hungry and will gladly meet you at the bowl during feeding time. I would recommend getting two dishes. Most indoor cats only need 3/4-1c dry cat food a day. You can also switch to a reduced calorie food for them.    They should not try and go after plants and human food. I would stay away from an all canned for diet as suggested. This can cause other issues for a cat who is use to dry. Can is also faster to eat, many cats overeat because like us, they actually enjoy eating.|`|eJ4xiaGOaa	my grandma has a REALLY fat cat named W.(pronounced dub-ya) and she wanted him to loose weight so she took him the vet and he said to give him a 1/2 cup of food a day. so what i would do is put one cat in one room and the other cat in another room and when they have both eaten a 1/2 cup of food send them on their way. :] W. has already lost a couple pounds in about a month so if you keep at then it should work.

ydshiNrKaa	He is really cute and will make a great addition to your family.  Just let him wonder around and look at his new home.  Make sure he goes to the bathroom before you take him in the house to avoid any accidents (which I'm sure there will be).  Taking him on walks, feeding him and giving him everything he needs will show him that you are the one who is going to see to his needs.  Start with basic commands like sit, stay, come, etc. to help with bonding.  As long as you leash him, he can go into petsmart with you.  They love going in there and exploring all the new smells.  I think he looks like a Scruffy for sure and wouldn't change his name. This might confuse him and you want him to feel confident about his new home and the people around him.  Crating him will depend on his behavior.  If he gets out of control you may have to crate him for a time being to get him use to household routines etc.  I'm sure you will do great with your new dog.|`|iU2fQBtRaa	He seems very good, and it is nice of you to do this. If you believe you have a good home for him, I would go for it. But first, the answers to your questions. . . .     Q: How can I help him to get use to his new homes?  A: Like i am saying in the next answer, show him around. Let him sleep in a comfortable bed, if you have a good yard show him that too, and stay with him and play with him out and in for a while. Let him feel comfortable with you and at ease.    Q: How can I teach him that I am the pack leader?  A:Some people pick up the dog and drop them on the floor, but I believe NEVER to do this. You could say "NO!" when he does something bad, and show him around YOUR home, making sure he knows where he cannot go and where he can. If there are places you get mad at him for going to, he should get the picture.    Q:When I go to Petsmart to buy him toys and stuff, should I take him?  A: no, but you could look up or ask another question about what kind of toys, or what kind of dog food, unless your going to cook his food.     Q:Should I crate train him, I really don't feel like I need to.  A: I wouldn't, dogs don't really need to be, only certain ones.    Q:Should I change his name? to what?  A: No, he won't respond to it if you change it. His name is Scruffy, and that is what he will listen for.|`|Cmn1drtUaa	>:o my friend has one of them they're sooo cute :D she names herss molly x]]     ll answer yur questionssmk >>    1. to get him use of the house just show him around and his bed and like if he pee's somwhere then like tell him of and he will eventually stop :]]    2.whts a pack leader xD lol i think i no well just you do eveything with him like and you take him for walks [[ ohh it wentt dark ohhh]] yerr n stuffff ..    3.. its up 2 yooohh maybe u shood for a nice walk n stuff xD      4. nahhhh only train him 2 sit n just the main basics coz he will kinda get annoyed at youu xD      5.what is his name maybe keep it becoz he is use yo it or change it 2 sumthing similar like example >.> buster pluster xD lol yerr      i think he is adorabke cutiee piee :]]       hope i helped |`|YHZVmh8Yaa	to help him just be nice and warming and let him have his space for a few days and he will get used to things     to teach him that u have to show that u r boss by first of all by not treating him like a human that is the main reason dogs start taking over and always start him on training after he settles in on like what he should and shouldn't do    If u don't have another dog then taking him along would be a good idea it will get him to be nonaggresive toward other dogs    u should crate train him because it gets u to be able to make sure your things r safe    I don't think u should in less u hate the name and only change it to something that is similar in sound so he will get used to it faster|`|uQrIdrjfaa	i like him|`|CNer40Xhaa	Well..  Do you have time to take this dog on walks?  Will you be able to pay for this dog?  Can you deal with the possible terrier temprament of this dog?  But, it's great that your adopting. And with a cute haircut, (puppy mowhawk)  he could be a great dog. Terriers are smart, but if they don't feel they need to do something over and over... You can't make them. And poodles have to have lots of exersise and can sometimes be snappy. Be prepared for both temps. But, if all those match your lifestyle, I say go for it! :)    How can I help him get used to his new home? Just don't make a huge fuss over him    How can I teach him that I am the pack leader? Use a clicker, terriers love to work for food    When I go to petsmart to buy him toys and stuff, should I take him? Yes, get him a cute haircut and socializing will come easy and fast    Should I crate train him, I really don't feel like I need to. It depends on if he is potty trained already. If he's not, then you'll need to crate train him.    Should I change his name? I like Scruffy, but it's kinda unoriginal. Conan, Adobe, Chester, Max, bullsey, snap and romeo are good|`|xkzkCtrUaa	I really like the name Jasper for a male dog.|`|SqPVrEaCaa	he is a beautiful animal!    he will get used to his new home in a couple of days and will learn quickly who is on charge (HIM!)    i am not fond of crates, personally, but each to their own  as far as his name goes, I would not change it--- he already knows his name and will already be on edge going to a new home

zto6BEwaaa	I absolutely love this brush called the "Furminator." It is stupidly expensive, but is the best brush I have ever owned. I highly recommend the investment, especially if you have four kitties! You will be astounded by how much fur you will brush away.|`|AA11171398	I am a dog and cat groomer, and the best thing I have ever seen work is the Kong: Zoom Groom. It is just like a rubber curry for a horse. It is a rubber brush that (because a cats coat is so staticy and fine) uses static electricity to pull dead hair right out of the coat.     Anything with metal like the slicker or prickly like a bristle brush is going to break the hair and cause more static. The Zoom Groom wear down after a while and becomes rounded. You don't need any pressure and your cat will never become impatient with you!     Kong's site is listed below. Take a peek at what it looks like and see if you can find something like it in your local petstore. I've seen Petco carry them before in the dog isle since they work wonders on dogs as well. The only difference between the 2 is one is dog shaped and the other is cat shaped.|`|RN1wGlWWaa	Try to find a fine-toothed comb - a little more space then the flea comb.  Brushes don't to anything for a long hair cat except on the surface.  You need to get to the skin to comb out tangles/knots.|`|4aAhEK9daa	If the fur's medium to long in length use a COMB - not a brush.  The comb will gently remove loose hairs of the undercoat and leave the top coat intact.  On medium to long coats brushes tend to pull out and break topcoat hairs and do little to remove the loose hairs of the undercoat.    This is the type of comb you should get.  You can find them at most pet stores - check the dog section http://www.fidoandfelixpetcare.co.uk/img...    edit: don't use the Furminator on a cat's silky coat - it will destroy it.
rrFbQZzIaa	corn snakes are perfect first time pets. That was the first pet snake I ever had. I didn't always give it the proper heat or attention sometimes but it still always ate and was one of the hardiest snakes. I have another today and he is just as good, always eating and never being a problem. They will rarely bite, if ever. I have personally never been bit. They will eat once every week when they are young and as they become adults, you can continue to feed once every week but once every two weeks is better and helps extend life expectancy. For heat, undertank heaters are best but you can use a heat lamp if needed. 80 to 85 is a good day time temperature and ten degrees less than your daytime temp is good for nighttime. If your room is warm enough, you will not need any type of night light. Also don't bother purchasing a UVB light, they are not needed and are just a waste of money. If you do use a undertank heater, you will want to have something simulate daylight, whether it be the light in the room, or one of the new coiled lights that don't generate much heat. you can view this care sheet as well http://www.kingsnake.com/rockymountain/R...|`|fwEf8BxMaa	Corn snakes (Elaphe guttata) make an excellent choice as a pet snake. Pet corn snakes are generally docile, relatively easy to care for, and do not get too large. They are excellent escape artists, however, so care must be taken when planning their housing.     Corn snakes do make a good choice for beginners since they are easy to handle and care for. However, they are also favorites with experienced keepers due to the vast array of beautiful colors and patterns selective breeding has produced.|`|b3pRYXkUaa	yes corn snake are great i have two they only get up to 5 feet if lucky some could reach 6 feet rare they come in many colors in the day the temp. should be 80 to 85 in the hot side and 70 to 75 on cool u need a uvb bulb to replicate the sun and a heat pad for the bottom turn the uvb bulb off every night to corn snake rarely ever bite to|`|E3VJAXDZaa	This site has tons of great info to help you out    http://www.reptilesexotic.webs.com/|`|ZEDxoOa1aa	Yes corn snakes are wonder for first time beginner pet snakes for anyone starting out with snakes.

Uy79dKEmaa	Oh, I'm so sorry to hear about Angus!  I know you were really looking forward to bringing him home :(.  At least you know he has a home now.    Both of my female cats have been quite territorial and don't like to wander from home.  My kitties have always been indoor kitties, but I occasionally will let them outside under close supervision.  Neither of the 2 females seemed very interested in going any further than a few yards from the house.  My boy, however, has to be watched like a hawk, as he is easily distracted and would wander after anything that  looked remotely interesting.    Of course, all cats have their own unique traits, so you should definitely do a few 'test runs' under close supervision until you are comfortable that your new kitty won't stray.    Good luck with your new kitty.  I'm sure Chester is anxious for a new pal too!|`|qVuYGiF2aa	Female|`|AA11171398	Every cat is different. Spaying your cats will help prevent wandering. Before letting her out I would personally train her to come home at command. Using a clicker for dogs and rewarding her when she comes will help ensure her returning. I would wait it out to see what her personality is like before letting her out.|`|7vJNHaskaa	Aww, sorry about Angus =/    I think she will be a great choice, she is spayed and all. I'm not sure that females are more likely to stay around than males, I think it depends on the cat. But good luck with her. =]|`|viUbPWNTaa	I can't answer your question but I can suggest something which eliminates the need to ask it.    Keep your cats indoors. I speak as someone with experience with 24 cats over the past 40 years.    We used to let some of our cats go outside and then one was killed by a car and another had a serious fight with another cat which left him badly injured.    There is no built in need, no necessity for letting a cat go outside.    Cats who go outside run the very real, and likely, risk of being injured or killed.    Whatever arguments you can give me for letting your cats go outside can be trumped by the simple fact that an indoor cat will have a longer, healthier and happy life.    You may be simply ignoring me but you are doing so at the expense of your cats.    There is no reason that a domestic cat needs to go outside.    If you want to get a new kitten or cat and don't want them to wander off - don't let them outside.    If you refuse to keep your cats indoors, don't get any more.    When you adopt a cat you are taking on the total responsibility for their care.    You are agreeing to provide food and water, love and attention, and medical care and a safe place to live.    The safest place for a cat to live is indoors.    People say that their cat isn't happy unless he or she can go outside - false. Indoor cats, if they have a good home, live happy lives.    Windows can replace fields. A screened in porch can be a jungle.    Please keep your cats inside. It will be better for both of you.    Your cats will be safer and you will have the peace of mind that comes from knowing that your cats are safe.    We have a web site about Feline Diabetes http://www.sugarcatsimon.com|`|SoFeInwKaa	Female. Boys are nosey|`|MZ8uqhNEaa	Ok, I'm really sorry about Angus. That kind of stinks. :/    Yes Maine Coon cats are laid back, but they will play if you want them too. They are devoted to their owners. Male cats wander father because they want to explore territory, they are curious. They also are more adventurous.     Females are not as adventurous, and are not as territorial. So, really this cat is a great fit. She won't stray far from home, and she will love you. :)      I hope I helped! Good luck with your new cat, hurry and get her fast! :D        EDIT:    First teach her her name. Get her to come when called, and keep her inside for 2 weeks at least before letting her outside. Otherwise she will get scared and run off. :)|`|25660b99958e6df83f2c651134b3891faa	some wander, some dont.    i have a 15 year old spayed female that wanders at least 1/2 mile from my house. i saw her in a gas station. she had to cross a busy highway. she could wander 10 miles for all i know, she leaves for weeks at a time.  she must be part maine coon, big fury,fur is more like hair then fur. tufts on paws.    over the years i have lost many cats, never knew what happened to them.|`|Uc96X3T3aa	Honestly, I know males wander off looking for girlfriends(typical lol). I would get your cats fixed(spayed) ASAP(Angels of Assisi will base it on your income)which will make them better pets. I stay outside with my cats whenever we are out to watch them so they do not run off. Best thing to do is keep them inside for long time (for adjustments and immaturity for kittens)then experiment the outside/inside option after well adjusting to the environment and getting to know his new family!!!!|`|4aAhEK9daa	If you're adopting from a shelter most of them REQUIRE that you keep the cat INDOORS where it belongs.  And if they come by to do a random check on you - which they are fully allowed to do - and the cat isn't inside your home - not only will it be siezed from you but you'll be put on a "Do not adopt" list that is shared with every shelter in your area.    Why do you think it's "amazing" that a kitten never leaves the house?  And why would you want it to?  It's VERY dangerous to allow cats to free roam and ESPECIALLY so young kittens.  If you don't want to keep both of these animals indoors then please don't get another cat.  Being "laid back" wouldn't keep a Maine Coon from wandering - it will just make it that much easier a target for a wild animal, a loose dog or other cats.  Read the article below to educate yourself - PLEASE.
sPOmz9wUaa	Dogs often eat grass if they are feelign sick because it cleans out their system. I would give your dog a few more handfuls and wait a day to see if she looks better. Also, you could try watchign her when seh goes outside. If she eats grass on her own seh is most likely sick. I recomend calling your vet.|`|J4zjrNpLaa	You DON'T want to give your dog grass to eat PERIOD!  Here's what you should do to help the throwing up and vomiting.    1.  First, don't feed her for 12-24 hours.  Keep her hydrated with plenty of water.    2.  Next, Feed her canned pumpkin.  Not pumpkin pie filling, i'm talking about 100% pumpkin from the can.  It contains fibers that will regulate her system.  Her poop will be orange from eating this, so don't freak out.  She'll get rid of whatever is making her ill.    3. For her next meal, give her easily digested food.  Something light like boiled chicken and some white rice.    4.  The next day, give her half her normal daily food amount (dog food)    5.  Over the following days, start increasing the amount of food you give her until you reach normal levels.

If your dog has been throwing up/diarrhea for more than a day I would say you need to go to the vet.|`|agh18eT2aa	I believe I'd call the vet and not give the dog grass. You don't know what is on the grass or whether that particular strain of grass is toxic to the dog.  You could be hurting more than helping.  If the grass had gasoline on it that was dry so you could not smell it, you could actually kill the dog.  I say no more grass, call the vet for advice.  They should be more than happy to make recommendations over the phone.|`|BWtjfkCdaa	actually when my dog eats grass it IS the thing that makes him throw up too|`|JtgYuu1aaa	u could put grass in one place and dog food in another, and he/she will eat it....tell me if it doesnt work|`|ydshiNrKaa	My dog only munches on grass when he has an upset stomach so feeding it to him is not something I would want to do on a regular basis.

yAsLhdp2aa	I would avoid OTC (no home remedis will clense the intestines of parasites) products for a reason--they are just that...not prescription strenth..it will be a waist of money..money you should apply on buying food and going to the vet. Call the vet he has the appointment at and tell them the situation, perhaps they have a bag of food that has been returned that they cannot sell.  or call the humane society or local shelter, they may be able to donate some.  In the mean time, only feed him every 8 hours 1 handfull each feeding..that will be plenty of food (calories and protein) to get him through the day..    13 handfuls is way to much to suspect worms.  how old is he? He may have an underline issue like an over active thyroid that increases motabolism.  they eat and eat and eat but still manage to loose weight.    bring a fresh fecal sample to the vet on saturday so they can test for parasites..and ask for an estimate if they suspect anything else so you know how much it will cost before you are at the check out desk.|`|AA11171398	I wouldn't try home remedies for worms, it may interfere with anything the vet can do. If he is eating a commercial brand, it may not be worms at all. If he isn't on a holistic diet, try switching. He may be constantly  eating because he is looking for nutrition. Also, try working out an exercise regimen for him. It'll produce a more controlled and healthy hunger.    Make sure to get a stool sample for the vet!    A holistic diet would be something like Innova, California Natural, Nature's Variety, Merrick, Wysong, or Wellness.     I personally don't know any fillers for felines.|`|eVPW1dwOaa	That's because you give him 13 handfuls of food a day.|`|VuE2wsAhaa	i dont think therez any home remedies, but u cld buy him the pill from ur local drugstore or sumthing.

EcKLqBnCaa	No, it's not cruel as long as you don't keep the muzzle on for too long, or if it's not too hot outside. Dogs pant to cool themselves off, but most muzzles don't allow them to do that. That's why you have to be careful with them, you don't want your dog to over-heat.     The muzzle is a good idea for your dog since it's for everyone's safety, including your dog's. You wouldn't want him to attack a larger dog and get seriously wounded if the larger dog defends himself. So don't feel bad about it, especially if he doesn't mind having it on.|`|9WqQYazcaa	no... if u don't and ur dog bites someone or someones dog it might have to be put to sleep. its a good idea to get a muzzle.|`|eas7tVQxaa	no no not at all!

You are actually being a responsible dog owner, muzzling your dog until he is better behaved.    Now as to the aggression, you may not need to wait to see a trainer, this is actually something you can fix yourself.  What often happens with smaller breed dogs, they are so darn cute, we owners let them get away with everything, we set no boundaries or rules. We allow them to do things that we would never allow larger dogs to do.  So to begin, you need to reestablish yourself as the leader of your dog. Do this by walking him properly, with him next to you or slightly behind you. The leader always walks in front and that is the way all dogs see it.  Make sure you have your leash just long enough to allow the dog to walk next to you comfortably. If he tried to pull away front or side, gently but quickly tug on the leash and then immediately release. You can also use a control word, stop, no, etc.  Be consistent and calm, and walk with authority. Your dog will be reading your body language and energy first.  Many dogs respond immediately to this new way of walking, some may take a few walks to get it.    As for the aggression toward others, when people/dogs approach on the walk, watch him for any signs of fixating on them, even when you see the fixating, correct with the leash tug and control word.  The key is to correct at the first sign of fixating, pulling, growling, etc. Correcting early and repetitively will stop the unwanted behavior from developing.  Give it a try, you CAN do this.  You may find that you do not need the muzzle after just a couple of "training" sessions.  Good luck.  http://www.cesarmillaninc.com/tips/basic...  http://www.cesarmillaninc.com/tips/issue...|`|QjoWA99Yaa	No, they're not cruel. People will see you're a responsible owner for making your dog wear one if he has to.|`|ZZWiUGr4aa	Your dog wearing a muzzle is better than a lawsuit or having him taken away from you for attacking someone.

It prevents your bird from flying into walls and windows and potentially breaking its neck or wing.       3- They say that male Parakeets are more friendly and snuggly than females.  Plus male Parakeets can be taught to whistle and talk.     4-Yes you want to get one bird if you want it to bond with you.  If you get two then they will bond with each other.    Additional Info:  Parakeets need at least an hour everyday out of their cage socializing with you.  They are smart and can learn tricks, to whistle, and males can learn to talk.  They come in a variety of colors.  A cage would run anywhere from $50- as big as you can afford, look on ebay  Min. cage dimensions: 18x18x20 (larger preferred)  Bar spacing: up to 1/2"  The bird will range from $30-$50 different colors are more expensive. They live from 10-15 years.  Good pellet diet,Millet spray,Mineral block,Water bottle for mist baths, and Toys will be around $50-$70. Expect to spend around around $150    Look for a hand-fed one that way they are already tamed and they trust people other wise if you get one from a petstore you will have to tame it yourself.    Another good bird is a Cockatiel they love to snuggle and mine likes to sit on my shoulder and make contented quiet little chirps in my ear.  Cockatiels need at least an hour everyday out of their cage socializing with you.  Sound level low to moderate.  They are smart and can learn tricks, to whistle, and some can learn to talk.  The four main colors are Grey,Pied,Pearl, and Latino.  A cage would run anywhere from $60- as big as you can afford, look on ebay  Min. cage dimensions: 20x20x26 (larger preferred)  Bar spacing: up to 1/2"  The bird will range from $50-$100 different colors are more expensive. They live from 15-20 years.  Good pellet diet food,Millet spray,Mineral block,Water bottle for mist baths, and Toys will be around $50-$70. Expect to spend around around $200  Also Look for a hand-fed one that way they are already tamed and they trust people other wise if you get one from a petstore you will have to tame it yourself.

Get a male they are better to bond with. Young!!!!!!!!!!! Not a year................ Do alot of resherch!!!!|`|xowm9t3kaa	1)It all depends on the bird attitude mine isnt noisy at all but she sings when i sing or play music, when you look for one its best to look for the most active though because that means its healthiest.  2) You should get their wings cliped professionally if your going to get them clipped you dont have to get them clipped though but if you take it out you have to have it hand trained.  3)female parakeets love to chew on stuff because in the wild they would chew out holes in trees to make nests. Males are the more talkitive ones.  4)If you want to bond with it I suggest getting one but you have to take it out of the cage alot. Parakeets in the wild lived in flocks and were always nuzzling eachother and preening eachother, if you dont get another parakeet then you are their only friend they thrive on being nuzzled and played with.|`|ml2OxC16aa	i have 5 parakeet and i also live in a apartment  1.no they make that much noise if they do put a blanket in the cage they will quite down.  2 its nothing it so they dont fly away, cut them every month if you dont they will leave thats wut happen to mine but she came back  3. i have 3 boy parakeet and 2 girls it doesnt matter   4.i don know|`|Mg8zk1n7aa	1. Yes they can be noisy, but not nearly as loud as larger parrots, and if you make a habit of tossing a blanket over the cage at night then they get used to sleeping quietly at night. Mine don't make a sound once that blanket goes on.  2. Many people clip their feathers to control them easier and make sure they don't get out. The thing is, they can get out clipped, too. You just need to be careful...you can do some more reading on that. Mine are not clipped.  3. I would suggest getting 2. If you're worried about taming, then keep them separate at first (but preferably in cages side by side to see and talk to each other), and tame them, ~then~ put them together. Do you have time to spend hours with a 'keet everyday? They are extremely social creatures and you would really enjoy watching them sing and chirp and preen each other...it is very cute. I have two, and I am very glad (I can cuddle with both, btw).  4. You can ~definitely~ still bond even if you get two. And this way you won't need to feel guilty when you have to leave for a while.    Sure a parakeet would be a good bird (especially for a first-time bird owner). The worst thing to do would be to get a bird that you aren't ready for - that'd be bad for you and for the bird. You could also consider Cockatiels, they tend to be calmer.    Good luck, hope I helped, feel free to email me any other questions.|`|GE8lIWtTaa	parakeets are very shy but if u sing or something they with chirp along with u. i have a boy parakeet and they need to have a partner but if u will play with it alot then u dont need 2. parakeets love to play if u have a small ball with a bell in it they will roll it and throw it at u if u play with it|`|veRfGJopaa	I would say get a cockateil..  They bond very well with children.  answers to your question  1..no it is not very noisy..  2..I believe clipping wings give you both time to trust one another with out it always flying away..wings grow back..my lovebird was clipped and now she fly freely and is my consent companion..wing clipping does not hurt the bird if it is done correctly.  3..most male birds sing more often and prettier..  4..YES.. start with one and see how it reacts to you if it does not bond get it a buddy..does not have to be the same kinda of bird  All of the above is true for  cockateil also..I think they are easy to bond with..I would suggest you get a young hand fed baby for each kind of birds..  I am all for you to adopt but most likely your chance is very low to have it friendly and it takes time for bonding..  I have a small shelter and my experience with parakeets after been a a cage of many other keets are very difficult to tame again.|`|UMg1CL7baa	I have a parakeet and i found that they are very very noisy at times, but at night we put a cover over them and usually when you do that they will stop making noise.    Your supposed to clip the feathers every so often so that they cant fly away when you take them out. it makes it easier for you to catch them if they get away.    i had a boy parakeet and now i have a girl one. The girl parakeets actually tend to be alot nastier from my expierence with them. My girl parakeet likes to bite where the boy parakeet was much more friendly    if you want to bond with it id say start with one, and then if you feel you can handle another get another.    birds make a good pet, and they are very fun.    enjoy!

BjFat2raaa	The reason the US keeps sending money is that the majority of people want to live peacefully.. not like these terrorists... and so the US is trying to help the nation get in order so they can do that without living in fear.     Biblically God no longer has his endorsement on the Jewish religion/people as a whole nation since they killed his son back in 33 C.E. it's now open to all people making a spiritual "Israel of God."    'Righteous is the man that cares for the needs of his domestic animals.'    'Who of you if his *** [donkey] fell into a well on the Sabbath would not go down and pull him out?'    But that's coming from the Bible... don't they use the Koran over there? I don't know what's in that book but it can't be good.  --------------------------  You asked "Is this the Isael of God?"  In short no. It means God does not endorse the killing of animals just to kill them.. or the mistreatment, neglect, or abuse of animals. Any group of people that is doing that can't be doing it in the name of God.. as found in the Bible.    "What does this all mean?" - Is there a part specifically?  ------------------------------  Sorry, this isn't nessesary in the best order...    Jesus = God's son, firstborn of all creation also came to earth as a sacrifice to pay back the debt of imperfection caused by Adam    Jesus while on earth talking to the Chief Priests and Older Men of the Jews It's a longer illustration but all needs to be read for the proper context -   ----------------------  Matthew 21:33-43 - 33?Hear another illustration: There was a man, a householder, who planted a vineyard and put a fence around it and dug a winepress in it and erected a tower, and let it out to cultivators, and traveled abroad. 34?When the season of the fruits came around, he dispatched his slaves to the cultivators to get his fruits. 35?However, the cultivators took his slaves, and one they beat up, another they killed, another they stoned. 36?Again he dispatched other slaves, more than the first, but they did the same to these. 37?Lastly he dispatched his son to them, saying, They will respect my son. 38?On seeing the son the cultivators said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him and get his inheritance! 39?So they took him and threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. 40?Therefore, when the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those cultivators? 41?They said to him: Because they are evil, he will bring an evil destruction upon them and will let out the vineyard to other cultivators, who will render him the fruits when they become due.  42?Jesus said to them: Did YOU never read in the Scriptures, The stone that the builders rejected is the one that has become the chief cornerstone. From Jehovah this has come to be, and it is marvelous in our eyes? 43?This is why I say to YOU, The kingdom of God will be taken from YOU and be given to a nation producing its fruits.  ----------------------  The Householder is God, the Cultivators were the Jewish people as a whole (there were still faithful individuals within the nation), the son of the Householder is Jesus, the son of God. Since the Jews killed his son God rejected the nation as a whole and turned it over to a spiritual nation 'producing fruits.'   --------------------------------------...  Jesus death on earth - Matthew 27:50-51:?Again Jesus cried out with a loud voice, and yielded up [his] spirit. And, look! the curtain of the sanctuary was rent in two, from top to bottom, and the earth quaked, and the rock-masses were split.     God tore the divider between the Holy part of the temple and the Most Holy part of the temple. The high priest entered the Most Holy only on the annual Day of Atonement; at no time could any other person go beyond the curtain that hung between this room and the Holy Place. This action by God confirmed that the atonement sacrifices offered by the Jewish high priest were now no longer of value and there was no need for the services of the Levitical priesthood anymore.        Jesus while on earth speaking to the Samarian woman at the well (Jew and Samarians hated each other then) - John 4:21-24  21?Jesus said to her: Believe me, woman, The hour is coming when neither in this mountain nor in Jerusalem will YOU people worship the Father. 22?YOU worship what YOU do not know; we worship what we know, because salvation originates with the Jews. 23?Nevertheless, the hour is coming, and it is now, when the true worshipers will worship the Father with spirit and truth, for, indeed, the Father is looking for suchlike ones to worship him. 24?God is a Spirit, and those worshiping him must worship with spirit and truth.  -------------------------------------  History of the Nation of Isreal (Ancient): Abraham, Issac, and Jacob.. these are people we follow in the early books of the Bible of people who worshipped God with faith. When Jacob was about 97 years old God changed his name to Israel (Gen 32:28). Israel had 12 sons: Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah, Zebulun, Issachar, Dan, Gad, Asher, Naphtali, Joseph, Benjamin. Famine moved the family to Egypt where they ended up slaves for 400 years (time of Moses). God freed them from Egypt and set them up as a nation which he created and to which he gave a theocratic government founded on the Law covenant as a constitution.   When God chose Israel as his special nation, he made a covenant with them, saying: If you will strictly obey my voice and will indeed keep my covenant, then you will certainly become my special property out of all other peoples, because the whole earth belongs to me. And you yourselves will become to me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation. (Exodus 19:5,?6) Israel was Godss special people on the basis of the Law covenant. (Exodus 24:7 the people agreed to be obediant to Gods rule)|`|B3FBgxjEaa	The zoo was booby trapped, Israelis went in, the zoo went bang.      Hamass is even killing animals.

RUxRNsf4aa	Standing or running martingale?   I do not suggest you use a standing martingale. They tend to make things worse, and are really just a band-aid for lack of training. No offense. But if you must, i would lounge your horse with it on a couple of times until he is completely used to it before you ride.  For a running martingale lounging would not really help because for the martingale to be noticed you have to apply rein pressure. I would suggest just riding at the walk for a while until she seems content with it. If your horse tends to be really problematic about new things i guess you could string the lounge line through the bit and martingale rings, around the back of the saddle and clipping it to the ring of the bit on the other side. But this probably isnt necessary for the average horse.    Edit---  i forgot to add about the noseband. If your horse wears a well fitting halter regularly, he/she shouldnt have a problem with it. If he or she does, just lounge with it on until they are okay with it.|`|bI7wMCJXaa	Running martingales are cheater tools to avoid having to train out the actual issue. Most horses will just break at the poll and keep using their backs, defeating the purpose. Instead of using tools like martingales you should ride in circles and encourage your horse to go forward and down onto the bit which lasts longer than using extra tack.    Put the noseband on him and see how he does. He shouldn't have any issues.     You should be doing your own temperament test, never heard of a vet doing one. use the vet's time to check for soundness and things you can't check for on your own.|`|wxFK2IpAaa	All  depends on the horse. Usually no major reaction but ask someone at your barn who knows the horses temperament.|`|LAXxaxAZaa	I'm not sure about the noseband, but I would put the martingale on a little loose if you're worried. In my experience, if horses think it's too tight and constricting, they might not want to canter and just do a fast trot.|`|hEXb1unraa	Standing or running?   If a standing, it has to be put on loose and gradually tighten to gauge the horses reactions, a running martingale is only engages when a horse lifts his head out of an ideal position but because the reins slide through rings can simply be disengaged by lengthening your reins. either a standing or a running has nothing to do with a cavason or flash noseband......what a standing martingale connects to is its own separate noseband that is not used to keep the mouth shut.|`|TA4Bvp4Kaa	They will probley be silly the first few times because they don't know whats happening  but then again it depends on how calm he is and how much he trusts you.  If he is a calm kind of horse he probley wont mind but if he freaks out easily it will probley take time for him to get used to it    Goodluck with Beans(if you keep that name)  you will love it once you get him|`|mcymZfuAaa	Start it loose and work your way up. It most like wont scare or hurt your horse but go slow just in case. i have a 4yr old AQH and he is totally fine with it,   with the martingale, do the same but you can move a little quicker. if your horse flips his heads a lot then be careful but it will protect your nose from being broken!
2fdee6b1fd597a29209ecfad9dc8b598aa	Pudding-like poop is usually a sign of intestinal blockage.  Sometimes ferrets who have a partial blockage will also vomit in an effort to get the object out, or because space is limited in their intestines.    He is still able to use the bathroom, right?  If so:    You can try pure canned pumpkin (Libby's) at 1 TBS every four hours for the first day, then 3-4 times the second day.  Watch what comes out and keep giving him the pumpkin if you see foreign objects in the poo.  Once it clears, then you can stop.    After that, you can use it as a preventative (nix the ferret-lax).  Even if it's not a blockage, pumpkin is great for settling upset tummies and alleviating constipation/diarrhea.    Be forewarned: this is FIBER.  A lot of fert owners are leery about fiber/carbs because it isn't a LARGE requirement of the fert's diet.  However, pumpkin is useful (in a way that the fillers, etc in kibble are not), and it has saved one of my ferrets from a painful surgery (hairball).    The poo will be orange, so don't worry.  And, you may have to force-feed the initially dosages, but my ferrets now love it (they get a TBS about every 2 weeks).    Hope this helps and good luck with your little guy :)|`|YNPNfbf8aa	ummmmmmmm...........well i ahte to tell you but hes either very sick or his time be about to come to a end. just be prepared and enjoy youre other ferrets when he passes|`|agS7LsZEaa	Well, if you aren't able to take him to the veterinarian and get medical help, his time might come sooner than if you take him to the veterinarian. Sorry, it's the circle of life.|`|udLtA7T7aa	he Could he have chewed on any rubber, such as toys, sneakers, rubber bands, balloons etc.. Normally ferrets only vomit when they have an obstruction which can be caused by rubber objects, cloth and even hairball's(has he been shedding?).         Whatever the cause you need to take him to the vet, if it is a blockage then he could die if you do nothing. He could also have some serious digestive problems so an exam by a ferret knowledgeable vet should be able to determine why he is vomiting.    Are you leaving food for him at ALL times? Sometimes a ferret left without food will devour his food too quickly and will then vomit. Also make sure the food is fresh each day and not 'out of date' as this too could cause vomiting if food is bad.    he could have    Gastrointestinal blockages are one of the major causes of premature ferret death.  Symptoms may include: Vomiting, lack of appetite or not eating or drinking at all,  straining when using the bathroom and producing no bowel movement or "skinny" stool,  weakness, and diarrhea.  It is very important to take your ferret to a veterinarian as soon as these symptoms begin.  Ferrets with blockages can die in a matter of days.  They can become seriously dehydrated within a day if they are vomiting or not taking in any fluids.  If you suspect your ferret has a blockage, don't attempt to treat your ferret at home with ferret or cat laxatives.  Rather, quickly look around the house for the item your ferret may have ingested (check their toys, look under the bed, under furniture and in their favorite hiding places) and take your ferret to a veterinarian immediately.  Your veterinarian will usually attempt to take an X-ray or use ultra sound to find the blockage. Unfortunately, surgery is almost always needed, so be prepared to make that decision.    or it could be      Insulinomas are growths that occur on the pancreas of the ferret.  These growths release insulin, causing your ferret to suffer from hypoglycemia (low blood sugar).  They can be cancerous or non-cancerous in nature.       Symptoms include mild to severe variations of the following: Weakness, lethargy, sleeping for long periods of time and then being very difficult to wake, vomiting, pawing at the mouth, drooling, loss of coordination, disorientation, vocalization while sleeping, and seizures (jerky leg movements with vocalization, urination).    This is a very serious condition that can lead to coma and death if not treated.  Ferrets are generally at risk when they reach three or more years of age.  If your ferret seems to be sleeping more than usual, lays on the floor and is non-responsive for a brief period of time, has a loss of appetite or has any of the symptoms listed above, you should have blood work performed by your veterinarian as soon as possible.    hope that helped =)|`|44kEtDvIaa	It's not a good sign.

YVNeeIIIaa	Too bad you want a short hair because Golden Retrievers are the best! GREAT disposition and around kids but anyway here are some options:  German Wirehaired Pointer  Giant Schnauzer   Akita  Doberman Pinscher     Greyhound  Irish Water Spaniel|`|W0buucLsaa	The only really big dog that suits those needs is a mastiff. There are lots of different types of mastiffs, but they are good-natured, low-energy, and don't require much exercise. Great Danes have a lot of energy and require moderate exercise.     The dogs around 60 pounds that suit those needs are bulldogs and basset hounds.    A lot of weims and labs are hyper due to bad breeding, but if you were to seek out an adult and thus could see the energy level and size, the ones that are really big tend to be quite lazy. I've seen labs get up to 120 pounds... way outside of breed standard, but that wasn't because they were fat. They were just MASSIVE.    Weims are the same way. They are high-strung due to bad breeding. If you just look for an adult from a rescue, I promise that you could find a mellow one.|`|Z0v6G0Kgaa	I'm pretty knowledgeable about dogs--I've owned 16 (a range of different breeds) and I compete in agility so I see everything (including Irish Wolfhounds, Mastiffs, etc.    I can think of only one dog that meets your requirements:  a rescue greyhound.   A rescue greyhound should come in around 60-75 pounds.  It's short-haired.  It's a docile breed that doesn't bark much.  It's not aggressive.  It needs a 30 minute walk each day and then spends the rest of the time lounging at your feet or napping in a sunny spot.  As for around kids--it's not aggressive, not quick to nip or bite but it's not a dog that will frolic with young kids.  A rescue will be especially mellow, come crate-trained and you'll be doing a good dead.  Negatives are:  it needs a coat in cold weather, it has to be on a leash at all times outside, it's a sight hound so it's attracted to movement by small animals.    Other than that, I can't think of a single dog breed that generally speaking would be a good fit.  Great Danes are huge dogs--just saw one at a dog park in Florida that weighed 140 pounds.  And yes, they need exercise.    Leonbergers are superb with kids, especially young kids and don't require much exercise but they shed like crazy.  Ditto with most big breeds that have a great rep with kids and aren't extremely active.    You could look at a Greater Swiss Mountain Dog.  It does shed but has a short hair.  It's great with kids and family.  But it can be huge (as big as 140 pounds) and might be more active than you're interested in.    I wouldn't look at a Dalmatian.  It satisfies many of your standards but it's often times quick to bite so I wouldn't trust it around kids and also the activity level:  I have a friend who runs marathons competitively.  She trains with her Dal who has run up to 20 miles at a competitive pace.  A Redbone Coonhound might also be an option.  Short coat, good with kids, good disposition.   But probably smaller than you want (they tend to max out at 60-65 pounds and the ones I've seen were all under that).  Also, they are probably more active than you want--high energy level.    I can't believe the folks who mentioned Goldens and Labs.  Regardless of what one's favorite breed is, neither of those dogs is a low-exercise breed, they have long coats and shed like crazy.|`|ydshiNrKaa	all the great danes I know need a lot of exercise so you may want to double check into that.

More active breeds will require longer walks and runs too.  So, are you at least willing to walk your new dog twice a day?  If so, do some online research on the different breeds of dogs that you are considering.  One dog that I have found to be good w/ kids and short hair, the boxer.

O4jGlC2caa	As others said... scar tissue combined with perhaps stitches that still need to dissolve under the skin (they'll do so over time... it's what they are designed to do) and some scratching.  If you see bleeding, more swelling, and anything that looks like an infection, take her back into the vet.  This should go away in a few weeks.  Keep using the neosporin for a few days too on anything that is still healing unless she looks like she is ingesting it (licking it off or something).  If that's the case, call the vet up for an alternative.|`|G6w8Kym4aa	Well its probably a scar from having them in her stomach! She will be fine.|`|2697c1729e017f780327da8beda5c294aa	Why are you coming to Y answers when you already have a Vets opinion?  On top of that your stating the dog isn't in any distress so your question is???|`|56C96CWlaa	There is something wrong. take him to the vet|`|EqtpJJaXaa	Don't worry about it. I have a scar that looks exactly like that on my knee. Even after five years. XD  I had staples too.   The bump will probably be permanent and won't bother her at all. Wutg staples, the flesh grows around it, and when the staples are removed, the hole left by the staples is filled in. Sometimes it engulfs the flesh that had grown around the staples. Therefore the bumps.  Or that's how it was explained to me.   If you're worried, just keep an eye on it for any redness or swelling. Neosporin isn't really going to help if they're already closed. Gently rubbing the area will encourage bloodflow and quicker healing.|`|UeCgFgucaa	take to doctor|`|RsXCY7wuaa	it looks like she has been scratching it but other than that she looks fine  keep an eye on  her|`|nmWztjGMaa	More than likely it is just scar tissue and nothing to worry about.  If it doesn't hurt her, or appear infected and if the vet is not worried, then I would not worry about it.|`|P2yRAWiJaa	It looks like her skin is irritated, but otherwise it looks fine.  The bump could be a result of the internal stitches that haven't fully dissolved yet.|`|Ed5JlMT9aa	I think she looks ok. She will heal soon and that will all go away.

Calm yourself. Your cat cannot give you nasty diseases by licking your canned pea soup. Your soup's fine. If you must know, cats' mouths are actually cleaner than humans' mouths.

Now I've got a dog, and I eat stuff that's been where her tongue's been too.
9759e8014743debd3d3fd1a7ad437c1faa	A 30-gallon or bigger tank is good for firemouths, which are one of my many favorite fish species.  They like lots of cave and rock crevices to hide in, and will spawn in one of these caves.  They grow to about five inches in total length. A few get bigger than this.  I'd start with a pair (maybe two pairs if you have a 50-gallon or bigger tank. They will probably present you with a lot of baby firemouths within a few months.  Firemouths are omnivores, but they especially like insects, insect larvae, and worms. They will eat all the standard fish foods.|`|QrjjiOgTaa	at least a 30 gallon.

Sd1m5j1Waa	I had one for a month and it I don't think it ever ate.

I would suggest letting it go, as I was heartbroken when it died.|`|McnuekTBaa	I have kept the Prairie ringneck on several occasions. I found that they ate earthworms readily, and were very easy to keep.  The portion of their range where these specimens originated has no small salamander species small enough for them to eat.  I suspect that salamanders are not as important to their diet as many authors would lead you to believe.|`|nmzpdvkqaa	i would release it in the wild. because its not right to take a wild animale out of their habitat and put them in a cage. but if it was captive bred that would be different story.|`|8i90ov0Gaa	Ringnecks make very poor pets, which is why you don't see them in the pet trade. The main problem is getting them to eat in captivity. Not all will eat earthworms. Their main food is salamanders. They also eat small lizards, small snakes, frogs, and insect larvae (grubs).    Dion, I noticed your reference to my answer in your answer, and as far as the food, I looked at three websites which all listed the salamander as their main prey. I have heard, however, from many people that they are difficult feeders in captivity, but I've also heard that it varies among the many subspecies, so maybe the ones in your area are easier to keep? I personally have never kept them, nor would I care to, so I'm by no means a ringneck expert.

7b4cd4909e3fddb3fc14d5677ec83183aa	hi, i have read your advert, they sound ok, but really you need to see the dogs and the home and take it from there. See all the paper work, finding out about there background, jabs,feeding,are they insured. See what there temperament is like with a stranger. There are good breeders and bad, this one doesn't sound like a breeder, just someone who just cant keep them anymore. I have many chis they are great little dogs. Please ignore people who say they are yap, because they dont no what they are talking about, i have lots and none of my bark,yap,bite etc, they are all friendly, i have never meet a chi yet that's not. There are just careful when meeting new people. Let them come to you, and not round the other way when you meet them.  If you have any questions about chi's, please feel that you can email me via my 360 for a private answer. You can also see my chis on there if you go to the flicker site. Good luck Maria|`|iU2fQBtRaa	Try thinking about it a little more. You need to know more about the dogs' behavior. It says they are playful but not much other. Chihuahua's can be yappy, remember. You might want to know how these dogs react to people that they don't know and if they bite, etc etc.    Hope you find a great dog!|`|Uib2Lmywaa	The dogs in the ad appear to be from a good loving home and to have good breeding.  The dogs look very nice. They may be a bit attached to each other as they are brothers and have grown up together.  I have 3 chis and breed (just the 1 couple). My male and female are very attached to each other and would be devastated if separated.  The other is their son and I keep him separated as my male picks on him some.    There are a lot of good breeders out there, just check them out carefully and do a thorough visit at their premises. You could also ask for references (vets, customers)    Good Luck.   I love my chis!!|`|6eaa0b61f602657500c8e4340d6b6bfeaa	Yes ask for vet references if you can.  Also it would be a great shame to split these two up, they will miss each other.

I didn't plan on buying a single ITEM when I walked in, and I went out with a DOG!!! But you know what, she's the best thing that's ever happened to me.    I fell in love with her the moment I held her (at the store)... my boyfriend says I kept saying, "I love youu" to her.    I WOULDN'T change her for the world.    She came from a breeder, has a certificate... and is a good looking dog. Everywhere I go people stop to comment on how cute she is.    So be patient and be open minded and open hearted. Don't discriminate so much. I'm not saying buy 100 dogs from an animal abuser, but there are other ways out there...      Those dogs in that picture look a little "big" to me... overweight almost.. If not now, they will be in the future.|`|YHZVmh8Yaa	if u rescue a dog from a puppy mill it will be really scard of u and wont know what to think of being on the ground but they are really good dogs when they get used to u.   if it comes from a bad breeder it might just be scard of a certain thing or be fine depends on what they did.

4a4b9be516eeab81005bf8f97c61e37aaa	That might be a good start.  Since they are used to crunching on kibble - if you chop necks and wings into very small pieces they might try it.    Those items are good and are NOT a properly balanced diet for cats so you have some things to learn there.  You can try to see if they will eat a quality canned food such as Wellness.  They may not recognise ANY meat as food.    There is a Yahoo group called Whole Cat Health and I would suggest you join it.  The members are feeding raw or converting their cats to raw.  The list owner is very knowledgable about cat nutrition.    I have been feeding a raw diet for eight years now.  I use a supplement powder I get from Feline Instincts with ground chicken and ground turkey.  Felice is the owner of the company and very supportive to her customers in helping them make the conversion.|`|AA11171398	My first suggestion is never stay in 1 protein! Cats are very adaptable by nature, and if your going raw do it all the way! You should stay on 1 protein for now since they have never had raw before, but then switch afterwards. More then likely after sticking with raw, your 1yo will be able to have a mixture of proteins at once!    It is dangerous to mix kibble and raw in the same feeding, just as some background info. Raw is digested much quicker then kibble, and raw shouldn't linger in the system.     Staying on 1 protein can make the cats immune to the benefits or even allergic to it. Proteins should be rotated every 3-5 months, and there are many to chose from! Chicken, duck, quail, turkey, beef, lamb, venison, rabbit, kangaroo, shrimp, sardine, crab, lobster, mackerel, tuna, salmon, whitefish, etc!    Obviously, avoid what your cat does not do well on. For instance, my kitten does not do very well with Beef. Beef is a very tough meat, most small dogs and some cats can have a hard time with it. But she does fabulous on lamb. You'll know if your cat does bad on it by how often they poop.    The raw that your talking about is a good but expensive way to do it, going to the local grocery store for food. Pet food companies actually make raw diets like Nature's Variety, Bravo, Wysong, and Primal. Nature's Variety even has raw on their kibble foods!    As far as how to start, start by hiding tiny bits of raw around the house, so the cats think they have hunted it. Or you could use it as a training treat, making them stand for it, or calling them and rewarding them for coming when you called (I'm doing it with my kitten for safety reasons). Find a kibble food that is the same protein as the raw your using, and feed them a small amount of raw at night. Very Important: make sure that before feeding raw, your kitty has gone  2! Raw needs to move through the digestive tract to not cause problems, and this is how you'll know what agrees with your kitty best! And, before feeding kitty again, make sure they have gone  2 again. It's gross, and time consuming, but once they are completely switched over you'll be glad you have done it.|`|9e42bab2f8e7deadb0c82f0996373877aa	Try these websites:  http://www.catnutrition.org/faq.php   http://pet-nutrition.suite101.com/articl...       Some recipes:  http://www.sahjasiamese.com/feeding/feed...   http://www.catnutrition.org/recipes.php     And you should talk to your vet as well.|`|y1TDricRaa	raw organic liver is one of the best source of protein, iron... and it is better that it is organic,  just try serving them some raw food in maybe another plate beside there food or add some in there kibble food so they will know what it is and get use to eating it.|`|cii9XShcaa	Others have given great suggestions but I wouldn't encourage you to hide raw around your house since it would be unsanitary to have raw meat around and not clean immediately afterward with hot, soapy water. It's just not sanitary. Anyway, probably to make the transition easier, you should probably switch the cats to a canned diet so they can become use to eating soft, chewy food rather than crunchy, dry food. Many cats eagerly eat canned food so it shouldn't be a problem. First, if you're leaving dry available all day, cut it down to 2-4 times per day, so they can get out of the habit of having food 24/7. Once feeding them on a schedule, feed one meal dry and the next canned, then dry, then canned. Eventually switch entirely to canned. AvoDerm Select Cuts is a canned food I would recommend for a short period of time. It is strictly meat and vitamins/nutrients. It doesn't have all of that unnecessary veggies/fruit. I say short period because Select Cuts only come in 3 flavors, 2 of which are fish. Cats shouldn't be eating too much fish during the week. Fish should be about 3 times per week or less. If you feed mainly the Chicken canned, the cats will become bored of it. Buy a month's worth of canned. Keep them on the canned for 2 full weeks, then start adding some raw to the chicken. I use mypetcarnivore.com whose supplier is Taylor Pond Farms. Another answerer led me to Taylor, but did warn me that they have had customer complaints in the past on receiving food that was already thawed. I haven't had any problems since I've been a customer. I chose them because they grind up the whole carcass, (if chicken, the entire body is ground excluding feathers) so this way the cat is getting the meat, bones and organs. All of which play their part in your cats health. Also this company doesn't add unnecessary veggies/fruit. You will have to add fish oil to the food. Make sure you do a somewhat slow transition by feeding. Each cat has their own taste. My cat accepted the turkey rather quickly, but chicken took a short while longer. I still haven't tried rabbit, fish, cornish hens, duck, or lamb. Good luck!    Edit: Another company would be Rad Cat Raw Diet. They would be my second choice as they do add a small amount of veggies and/or fruit to their frozen recipe.|`|Luf6j8P1aa	give em raw food|`|25660b99958e6df83f2c651134b3891faa	the only problem would be the sudden switch upsetting the stomachs. and maybe mouth hurting from not using muscles and teeth for so long.    i would just start adding small  amounts of raw food, slowly adding more raw and less kibble, for about a month.  they should be fine.  any signs of diarrhea or vomiting, cut back on the raw for a week.    they are designed for raw, they will adjust very quickly.    i do not fed raw, i would google for more advice.    mine are indoor/outdoor, they catch their own raw food.
xtRm5NV5aa	Unfortunately, there's not really much that can be done. Hamsters are too small to have any sufficient treatment in case of a cancer, anyway. It's sad but you just have to wait and see.

Try letting him only slide that last foot, or so.  If you find him jumping up and down and wanting to do it all over again, then you can increase the height.  If he staggers and throws up, time to quit.|`|K2vam6Tgaa	no but you should not bring him out side!!!!!!!!!!! he might get lost or there are germs on the slide and what if you got distracted?? where would the hamster go you would lose him forever so i don't think its a good idea to take him outside he can get very sick and no it is fun for him to go down a slide but not out side!!|`|y1ZKE3XSaa	Chances are you are scaring it. I'd be careful with what you do with your hamster because with them being so small too much excitement can cause a heart attack. I used to do all kinds of crazy stuff with my hamster. Just be careful that you don't do it too many times or too often.|`|ak9DrBSwaa	No it's not ok. Please don't take your pet outside where it can easily get hurt, over heated, exposed to predators and diseases that the rodents outside may have, inadvertantly escape, etc.    Also, if you manage some how to have a human slide inside your house, it still is NOT ok to slide your hamster down that.    Please ask your parents to help you find a book or website that will help you find appropriate ways to interact with your pet. There's lots of fun things you can do, but taking them to the park to slide is not one of them.

I8dkpUQ7aa	Well to buy the horse if you want a good one I would suggest buying a horse no cheaper than $3,000, although I bought my green ex racer TB for $900 dollars. She wasn't broken to ride (except racing) and we put $2000 into her training--she's 6 now and we still have to put more money into her training this spring, since she's still so hot blooded and crazy (but I love her!) Grain typically costs around $10 a bag, and most people feed their horses 2-3 pounds a day. Dewormers can cost anywhere from like 5-25 dollars. Veterinarians are ungodly expensive, and hay runs at $5.00 a bale now. If you only have one horse, you will probably feed two bales a day. Lessons cost 25 + per lesson, and saddles range in prices, as well as blankets, etc. Farriers usually charge around 160 for shoeing all four hooves and trimming. And those are just the basics! Don't forget to add trailer costs, truck costs, fuel, and show entry fees!|`|uWcD70hXaa	well it all depends on the price of hay,feed and board(if you are) where you live. I pay for feed, hay, bedding for the stall, trimmings every 6-8 weeks, and a vet visit every year so i pay about 2 grand a year not including other stuff like toys, treats, tack, etc. also if you are boarding it will cost more i am lucky and keep her at my grandmas so if you know someone with horses nearby see if you could keep it there for cheaper boarding. there is also the option to lease a horse. no one can really give you an exact estimate because it always depends on what you buy and how much it is where you live. but good luck and i wish the best!|`|BkJ7pxQZaa	For me    Board: $50.00 / month -includes feed  Vet: $100.00/ yearly  Farrier: $20.00/ trimming  Tack: $200.00/ whenever it needs replacing  Horse: Free    And I know I have the extremely cheap side of things.|`|at7LXbEfaa	For me. It costs around $350 a month.  For  Agistment: $50 a month  Feed: $100 a month  Shoes: $90  Wormers: $20 ect/  and then some extra incase of emergancies.    so multiply $350 x 12 = $4200.  + lessons which r $40 a lesson and thats every2 weeks|`|EtLDmuhqaa	  ?meaning like maintaining it??  if you have a pretty good job then  not that much,  but if you have a   fair job,  then you'll have to make  a budget,  seriosly [like no joke]   my dad has a white horse &&   he is so cute!!  we have a ranch [but  its like combined with all my family  so we have like alot of animals all  over.]?|`|eXDDODfHaa	for hay it cost like $500-$700 for like 200 square bales|`|vfhKkiSKaa	I pay around $5,000 - $6,000 per year for my horse.  It all depends on how much I spend on extras every year.|`|cDEgG1eLaa	The price of a horse can range between $250-$10,000 dollars. It depends on what horse your getting.    this is how much i pay for my pony (its more for a horse)  $2500 horse  $120 month stable staw and hay   $100 good grooming kit   $350 sadle  $50 bridle  $120 for my riding boots  $50 for my hard hat  $45 every 8 weeks for shoes   $45 month feed   and then vets bills on top of that plus dentist visits and regular worming    Add that all up which would be: $3380

KhjpmxGeaa	The Parson Russell Terrier was formally known as the Jack Russell Terrier. The name of the Jack Russell Terrier was changed to the Parson Russell Terrier effective April 1, 2003 as requested by the Jack Russell Terrier Association of America, which was changed to the Parson Russell Terrier Association of America. It was developed in 19th century England by a clergyman named Jack Russell. This feisty little terrier was used to hunt small game, particularly fox, by digging the quarry out of its den. Breeders have emphasized its working ability, so the standard is very broad, encompassing a wide range of accepted body types. On English hunts, the Parson Russell Terriers were supposed to be long-legged enough to keep up with the hounds. The energetic and playful Parson Russell makes a good family companion. Some of the Parson Russell's talents include: hunting, tracking, agility, and performing tricks.The Parson Russell Terrier is a perky, merry, devoted, and loving dog.  Spirited and obedient, yet absolutely fearless.  Careful and amusing, he enjoys games and playing with toys.  Stable Parson's are friendly and generally kind to children. Children should be taught not to tease or strike the dog.    Parson Russel    http://www.pedigreedogs.co.uk/images_bre...    http://www.zoologie.de/grzimek/files/ima...    Jack Russel    http://www.dog-breeds-explained.info/ima...    http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_LYxGQn08RU4/SF...|`|nmWztjGMaa	They used to be the same dog.  The AKC set guidelines and limits on size.  The Parsons is just a little bigger than the Jack.|`|Ed5JlMT9aa	There is no difference at all. The name Jack Russel was just changed to Parson Russel.|`|P2yRAWiJaa	Go to akc.org for Parson Russel pics/info and dogbreedinfo.com  for Jack Russel info.    The Jack Russel was first.  It was orginally recognized by AKC but the JRTCA got upset about something and AKC decided to not recognize the breed as of 2003.  The Parson Russel came about shortly thereafter and did originate with the Jack Russel - though they are now different enough to be considered seperate breeds.  PR has longer legs and a little different coat and the JR has shorter legs and (I believe) 2 different coat types.|`|wrUsMG4Jaa	There is no difference.    The Jack Russel was renamed the Parsons Russel Terrier a few months back.|`|8OI8RJvAaa	I have had a Jack Russell terrier for 16 years now. We got him from a breeder when we lived in England. He is of the original variety: short legs, docked tail, broken coat (mix of smooth and rough). I personally don't care for the Parson because that is not how the Rev. John Russell of England intended them to look when he bred them in the 1800s. They are intended for use on fox hunts and can easily fit into fox holes. I love my JRT!! They do like to chew (a lot) when they are young!!|`|6yTFWehtaa	heres a site:    http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/parsonrussel...    http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/jackrussellt...|`|gMNXzDa0aa	Well there is sort of a diffrence the Parson has sort of a beard http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/co... pu the Jack dosen't http://www.gotpetsonline.com/pictures-ga...

IuvppIEaaa	I think its adorable :]  If you like it then go for it.  Who cares what anybody else thinks?  It is YOUR hamster!  I have a guinea pig named Darcey,  and I think its a beautiful name!  But everybody thinks its "weird" or "different"  That's what makes it cute!  Because its uncommon!  Unlike "Brownie" or "Butterscotch"  Those are cute names but,  everybody has them!

xmibEEdcaa	Yes, cats can get depressed and anxious, and it certainly sounds as if that's what's wrong with Kurt. I'd take him to the vet anyway, though, just to make sure that there's nothing physically wrong with him.  It's probably psychological, but it's always best to make sure -- especially since you've noticed changes in his coat. Also, even if it does turn out to be psychological, your vet might be able to recommend some more approaches to reducing his anxiety.    If there's nothing wrong with him physically, then you can help him by giving him a lot of extra time and affection, and by reducing as much as you can the sources of stress.  If you don't brush him, now might be a good time to start (assuming he likes it, that is. If he doesn't, then don't force it).  Lots of play time and petting will help him to feel more secure. If there's any way to set aside a special "Audrey-free" space for him, where he can feel safe and in charge, and retreat to whenever the kitten's freaking him out, then that might help as well.    Finally, you might want to consider a product called Feliway, which is a pheromone-derived substance that helps to reduce anxiety in cats. Your vet probably carries it. Unfortunately, it's rather expensive, and not all cats seem to respond to it.  It worked wonders on my own neurotic cat, but I understand that others haven't gotten the same results.  If nothing else helps, though, it might be worth a try to see if it can help Kurt adjust to the new kitten.|`|25660b99958e6df83f2c651134b3891faa	yes, they get depressed, but i think yours is more of fear or survival.    stray cats are poorly groomed because grooming is secondary to survival. many people are shocked to see a stray clean herself up within a day of them taking her in. once she has food and shelter, she relaxes and grooms.  yours sees the kitten as a threat, an intruder.  the only suggestion is time, and make sure he sees the other male getting along with her. cats in a pride do what is good for the pride, if one member shuns a newcomer, but the others accept her, he accepts her, for the good of the pride.|`|ZjrFsYz5aa	Who cares its a cat.
AA10356572	the best way to end suffering is to SPAY and NEUTER your pets.. because most suffering happens as a result of too many pets being born than there are homes for..    i have sheep as pets (I dont eat them) I have chickens too - we eat their eggs..    here is a picture of the hens..  http://www.picable.com/Nature/Cats/Cat-a...    here is a story about the sheep (some of them - 2 we recently saved)    http://www.associatedcontent.com/slidesh...  really cute story|`|Mzjoeld4aa	some people are just heartless when it comes to animals.... wat can you do?
ECgFNEWjaa	Horses do not express love in the human sense.  They develop bonds based on trust and respect.  Watch how the horses interact with each other in the herd or a mare with her foal and you will see the different levels of trust and bonding they have with each.  Horses that share a close bond will just hang out peacefully together, groom each other, stand so that they keep the flies off their buddy's face with their tail.|`|at7LXbEfaa	They'll see you coming up into their paddock and they will whinny and canter over    Nuzzle you    Follow you    Ears forward when they see you    Lick you    Move around to see you wherever you go (ie tack room or otuside)    Umm.. my friend talks to her horse and he makes sounds back   so talking to you...|`|01j7Jx0Gaa	I had a horse that got in between me and a horse who kicked at me.  He was always there for me. I think you can see it in their  soft eyes, their welcome winny, their need to follow you around and pester you because they want to be near you.
Fx9bxZ8aaa	what ever you can afford with your money.i don;'t want to say a 55g tank because what if you don't have enough money.so i think the next one should be a 30 gallon tank.also you did not mention what fish you have.|`|pSofPy05aa	simply the biggest that you can afford, and fit.  the more water volume the easier it is to maintain the system|`|fNqYbxrBaa	i had a 50 gallon, and it was a nice one... it got the job done right. so try to find one at a yard sale... pet store...etc
SzW9GmRsaa	They probably just pigged out because it was there and it was a novelty - I suspect that once they're used to it and the second bale goes in they will pace themselves and not gorge.    I do not recommend fencing the bale off ... they'll only go and try to steamroller through the fence, at the least breaking your fence, and at the worst - well most of us have seen what happens to a horse who gets stuck in a fence...    I'd just put the second bale out.  I'd be very surprised if they ballooned on that one too.|`|e334d47d0cf581231e2545cccfc166e2aa	Your horses will probably eat the second bale more slowly once they get used to having one.  I used to get the same results when I'd give my 3 horses a round bale.  The next day they'd all have big round bellies from eating so much.  If you keep a round bale available all the time, they'll start to cut back on how much they eat.  I've gone back to all square bales now, because they'd eat so much and waste a lot, too, making the round bales more expensive in the long run.|`|Pm8nsCGZaa	All's I can say is..WOW!  I have had four horses on a round and it takes 10 days to go through it.  I now have 3 on a round and it lasts 2-3 weeks or more. They have no pasture, and I give them a pound of oats between the three of them a day.  Is yours in a bale feeder?  That will help considerably. Otheriwse about all you can do it pitch it.  Rounds weigh about 1300-1500 pounds, that means your horses are eating 500 pounds of hay a day??? thats what, 250   a day per horse???  No way! Don't make sense. Are you talking a big ROUND bale? I would think they would be dead eating that much. I don't think it's even possible!  If it is just sitting in a field without the wrapper/string, they are probably pawing and laying on it.|`|253749a8c740b2b9ceb438a7f88d0d44aa	You give them free choice, they will eat freely! And, round bales are wasted more than any other feed/hay that you can give a horse. Your best bet is to take the time and break off what you want to feed them. You'll have to get used to the pain, that's just part of large animals!|`|XL62syrCaa	Fence it off and only let them eat off it a couple times a day. I understand that horses are foragers but domesticated horses can eat till their sick!|`|bI7wMCJXaa	The tarp thing is a bad idea. moisture will get in through the holes and when the sun hits - even in winter - will create heat which added to moisture aids in mold growth.    I've seen 7 horses eat off a round bale for a month so I don't know what your horses are doing eating so fast. Guess you'll have to buy more hay.|`|w7Ma5KZcaa	you could take the round bales out of the pasture/padock or what ever you have and take big enough peices off of it and throw it in there and let them eat it instead of them eating the whole bale. i have a horse and a pony and one big round bale lasted them about 1 1/2 months and they where on it all the time.|`|MnUKF5GBaa	Free choice is great, waste is always there with round bales, but there is also dangers with round bales and horses.  You need to watch for moldy hay and botulism.  Tarping will help, but most happens when it is baled.  If it were my horse, the waste might be bad hay as she is selective and leaves moldy hay alone, at least she has in past.  If you know the hay is good, then I would invest in a round feeder may save on some of the waste.

They usually do this a few days after birth. Why would you want to do this anyway?  also, you may not find a vet who would be willing to mutilate your dog.|`|at7LXbEfaa	its to late.  He will be in TREMENDOUS pain  besides the ONLY reason that people clip staffis, and pists ears are so they dong get ripped of in fighting  and i doubt u want to fight ur pup|`|zguucR8yaa	Don't. It's unneccesary, and very painful.|`|DWvnIYTEaa	No. Clipping dogs ears is cruel and is purely vanity on the part of the owner. Its not beneficial to the dog what so ever. I have a 3 yr old boxer and they apparently are "supposed" to have their ears done, she doesnt and shes beautiful :)|`|eVPW1dwOaa	No! That's terrible. Leave him alone.|`|rXMTdUg4aa	Nope. Vet hospitals are beginning to stop this procedure. Its unnecessary and all it does is put your animal through pain and makes them look mean. Let him keep his ears!|`|WcZSQxoCaa	they can be up to 8-9 weeks before some places stop clipping the ears. but i really don't think you should, people only get their ears clipped when they fight dogs or to make them look intimidating.|`|OpcYJeQfaa	i think you should   i have a female pitbull   and she is precious i had hers clipped when she was 8wks   you should so get them clipped dont listen to the thats what they "think" i know the  right answers on dogs           im 12 years old and i have done many reseach on dogs i will become a vetnarian when i get older            they numb the dang dog dont listen to them             thanks=]|`|xkzkCtrUaa	Don't thats cruel. Actually..My friend did that and it took a year to heal. This will change your dog extremely.|`|gADpKFktaa	I don't know much about ear clipping, but It's sound like it would hurt the dog, so, I wouldn't do it!     And I kinda like the natural look of dogs.|`|wUg7iYU1aa	There is absolutely nothing wrong with cropping a dogs ears. As long as it is done by a vet and at the right age which is 9-12 weeks and some vets will do them up till 14 weeks. Make sure you check the vet out and make them give you references to previous croppings they have done. The dog does not hardly feel a thing it is done at these certain ages because the nerve endings in their ears are not fully developed, all my dogs are back to normal the same day as soon as the anethesia wears off.

OaaJ7o9Haa	Selcon is an enriched formula that you can buy since brine shrimp are filter-feeders but they can also be fed: meal, egg yolk, whey, soybean powder or wheat flour.     Egg yolk is best for young brine shrimp because they require a high protein diet. As the shrimp get older you can feed them other inert foods including spirulina. Overfeeding = pollution. Problem solved by drip-feeding a few times a day.
7FGQ51A0aa	I've never had to trim my hamsters nails, and I've owned more than I can count. I used to ensure that there were plenty of wood chews in the cage as these wear down the nails when the hamster holds onto it. I also use sandpaper sheets that are for bird cages underneath the woodchippings as this helps. If for some reason your hamster's nails are getting long then take them to a vet to get them cut as it can be dangerous to cut them yourself as you may cut them too far and cut into the blood supply of the nail.|`|S3eJJu7haa	Ouch! no no no no no no!  that will hurt there tiny fingers are delicate!  you dont want to hurt it do u?  just put its nails on concrete to shave them down or bricks   please dont clip it you can accidently chip its tiny finger|`|ak9DrBSwaa	Trimming your nails is likely to be stressful for both you and your pet.    Some alternatives.    There are "nail trimming tracks" available for the "Woodent Wheel" brand running wheels. They are very effective, but please follow the directions and leave them in the cage only for the amount of time you're supposed to inorder to avoid injuring your pet.    Another idea is to get a clean flat rock and place it in the cage under the water bottle. This will naturally wear down your pets nails every time she gets a drink. Be sure to place the rock in such a way that it can't fall on your hamster - flat rocks are best as they don't have a chance of shifting and toppling over.    DON'T put sandpaper on the bottom of your pets cage - for the same reason the woodent wheel gives you a time limit - your pet can't escape this and could actually cause damage by wearing nails down to far or develop bumblefoot. You also don't want your pet hamster eating the sawpaper.    I'm still trying to figure out how "Lucy the Hamster Vets" advice of wood chews being held by your hamster would do any good for BACK feet? Anyone else doubting that she's actually a good vet?|`|1YYmQI5Naa	No! Don't try clipping his nails! Let him walk around on concrete to shave them down.|`|LNnRSLdtaa	no  hamsters dont need there nails cut   youl probably cut the blood vessle in the nail and make him bleed    if they are getng long get him a brick or something to shave them down on       if you insist on doing someting use a file  if you cut the nale too short hel squeak and bleed|`|3qdwPjKdaa	As long as you use baby nail clippers or you   can put sand paper on his wheel to ware them down
tPGxPDvBaa	Honestly shibas are not for novice dog owners.  They are difficult breed - very clever & agile & will run away any possible chance they get.    Shibas generally do NOT get along with cats - they are major prey hunters.  I'm sure there are few that do but they are minority.    Crate training is the same for any breed.  You have to work on it & they can hold as adults just other dogs for 8,9, 10 hr. They will need long daily walks esp. w/o a yard.  They should never be allowed out leash, they will not come back to you & are hard to catch.  Their prey drive is strong & they want to hunt & explore & are notorious escape artists.    I think most are easily hose broken - they are smart & like to be clean but if you can catch their signals, they have no problem going inside.    Adoptions fees depend on rescue or shelter.  General fee from rescues are $200-$400 for a fully vetted dog.  So you wouldn't need shots if over a certain age & they would be fixed.  It is rare to find one under 6mo. of age.    Save your money til your mom says ok or you will be just throwing away money.  Doubtful she will be impressed by stuff & would likely to agree  if you have money than things. You will need a fund to put monthly installments for future vet bills.    Even though you said no sites please look at this one.  It have good accurate info on shibas.    http://shibainus.ca/index.html    This will take you thru the steps of shiba ownership which would help you.    Oh I do own a shiba besides having over 30yr of grooming experience.|`|uQrIdrjfaa	1. yes  2. definitley  3. 2  4. no  5. 400$  6.$1000  7. no  8. no      p.s. i dont like ur name.|`|AA11579568	1. Not necessarily  2. None, dogs need to be free  3. Hours? I don't think hours are needed, maybe one hour at most  4. Not necessarily  5. None if you go to the pound  6. $200 at most if it's healthy  7. No, you should respect your mother's wishes until you have your own home.  8. I wouldn't hire you if I knew you were doing it just to get a dog your mom didn't want you to have|`|oHKpy4IRaa	1) If you get a puppy it will not bother your cat but you have to introduce them the right way. You need to get a baby gate or put each of the on one side of a door and just open it a little then they will be able to sniff each other a little then if they are both good keep on opening it a little bit more and then keep on doing that until the door or gate is completely open.     2) I think its your opinion how long he/she should be crated. I crate my puppy from 4 to 5 hours at the longest. But you don't always have to crate him/her at first you should crate train your puppy then after he/she is completely trained you can take him/her to doggie day care or get a pet sitter to watch him/her.    3) If your getting a puppy then you will need to take it out at least every 1to 2 hours or else you will have a lot of accidents in your house. After your puppy is housebroken I would say to walk him/her once or twice a day for one hour scince shiba inu's do need some excersize.    4) I've never owned one before but I know someone who has two and then owner told me they do house train pretty quickly.    5) It depends on where you go to adopt it. Diffrent places will ask for different prices. Call some shelters near by where you live and ask them how much it is to adopt a dog.    6) I'm not sure about this question, sorry.    7) I think your mom would definatly say yes. I think any mom will say yes if you do that. If your mom still says no then show her a picture of a little shiba inu puppy and tell her ''how could you say no to this face?'' (shina inu puppies make everyone happy) and tell her how great shiba inu's are.    8) I don't need a sitter and all the people i know who need a sitter have me so i'm really sorry. You should go to the dogn park and hand out flyers to people who own dogs or you could leave flyers in people mailboxes to get some customers.    hope i helped
rXMTdUg4aa	1, yes, but the same can't be said about your cat.  2, Don't crate your dog.  3, You should walk as much as possible.  4. Its the same as any other puppy.   5. A few hundred  6. A few hundred  7. Probably not.   8. Find a real job    Its your parent's decision on whether or not you can have a dog.|`|tPGxPDvBaa	Already gave you good info as a shiba owner  & have no idea about those shelters.  Calling them & asking what their fees are would be correct way to go.  All rescues have different fees.|`|W02kTOqmaa	Reposts are annoying and spam the system. Im not going to take you seriously or think of you as a very mature capable person if you repost while your last question is still on the first page!|`|280d96ad7b5e9ffad03a34a66cac5db0aa	1.) Not necessarily. Typically, puppies do well with other animals if they're raised with them. However, dogs with very strong prey drives may still be triggered to chase the cat, for instance.    2.) As little as possible, of course. The crate should be used any time you can't watch the dog and need to have him in a safe place, but hopefully you'll have plenty of time to supervise. While the puppy is very young, you'll need to be slowly desensitizing him to the crate, so in any event, it'll take awhile to build up from thirty seconds to four hours. If we're talking about an adult that is already crate-trained, then eight hours at the absolute maximum, but preferably no more than six.    3.) As much as you can. Walking is actually a relatively poor way of giving exercise, so you'll have to do a considerable amount of walking to give the same amount of exercise as a more strenuous activity. For instance, I can wear my dog out with a half hour of soccer in the back yard while it takes well over an hour of walking to tire him out. But anyway, just walk him for as long as you can. A bunch of shorter walks (like several half-hour walks) is a common choice.   All dogs are individual. You might get a lazier Shiba or one that's constantly on the go, so you'll need to found out for yourself how long to walk him. They do have an incredible amount of endurance, so you'll probably need at least two good, long, hard walks every day.    4.) I have indeed read several times that they're naturally clean dogs and that housebreaking is typically pretty easy.     5.) I imagine that would depend entirely on the shelter, rescue or person you adopt him from.    6.) That really varies. I assume you're getting a small puppy that will need all its shots. Most rescues vaccinate all their dogs. If you have to have it done yourself, the vaccinations and boosters can run anywhere from $20-150 while things like heartworm preventative are usually around $25. If he happens to come with an already existing problem like heartworm, treatment can cost as much as all the vaccinations. Then there are accidental things you'd have to pay for, like if he eats a stomachful of rocks (surprisingly common.. oy vey). I'd have an absolute bare minimum of $300 available, but in case of an accident, you'll be ill-prepared.    7.) I have no idea because I don't know your mom. If I were your mom, I'd probably be ticked off at you for assuming I'd ever say yes and buying the supplies, and then I'd holler at you for thinking $200 would mean anything in the long run as for the cost. (Our dog is a year and a half old and must have cost as $10,000 by now. Yeah, he ate a bunch of rocks..) But seriously, that's just me, and I'm a sourpuss.    8.) Use more detail in explaining your credentials. Don't just say you've taken babysitting classes. I mean, expand on all that stuff. What did you learn in your CPR class? What are those eleven pets? You have to sell your idea to the customer.   Being the cranky person I am, I was peeved by seeing the second "gizmoz" or whatever it is because I don't really care about silly things like that, hey, I'm looking for a professional!   The exclamation marks in the page titles seems a tad immature.   I really like how you have that easy-to-read calendar that lists your available times.   If you're serious about it, it'd be nice to see a page where a potential customer could "meet" you. You know, an info page to introduce the both of you. That strikes a person as a commitment that makes you seem serious.

Look at Solid Gold lamb & rice is is below the or at the 24% mark.   Canidae All life stages or their Lamb & rice is at 24%.  Natures Variety Lamb & Oatmeal is at 26%.     It's the protein levels you have to look at besides what in it.  No Giant breed or large breed dog should eat any dog food over 26% the lower the better for slow growth and strong joint and bone set. OK
AA12393315	The only thing I would suggest is when she is close to the time, to put her is a room with the box  and maybe another option, that way the pups will be born where you want not in your bed.|`|fgxajTiBaa	Nooo do not let her go into labor on your bed and don't let the puppies sleep with you, what if you squished one? She will use the whelping box when she is ready. Don't you have a breeding mentor who could help you with this?|`|Mzjoeld4aa	i let my dog go on my bed but its a guy so if i were you, since its in labor, maybe put gates around your bed so the dog cant jump up just in case because yea you dont want the puppies born or staying in your bed (at least not when there little) and maybe keep the habit for the dog not to be in your bed for a while (even after the puppies get old enough to be adopted) after that then if u want it wouldnt hurt to let the dog in your bed with you|`|ydshiNrKaa	Try getting her to sleep overnight in the box and see how that goes.  You really don't want her having the pups in your bed (gross), and getting her into the habit of sleeping in her whelping will help you and her out in the end.|`|zWBYxMvWaa	Some people let the dogs be born on the bed and then move the pups to the welping box.         But if you don't want to ruin your bed, heres what to do.  Reward her for being in there and line it with lots of soft blankets (you can remove those later and add towels). Start getting her to sleep in there as well.   It will be tough but unless you want a bloody bed.... yea I would get her used to the welping box.|`|cJxNY1Ctaa	get her a large vari-kennel, put lots of cozy blankets in it, and start showing her to go into it and just leave the door open at all times. once it gets closer to her due date, start locking the kennel at night. by that time she should be comfortable enough with it to have the pups in there. good luck : ]|`|Mx5Fo0Asaa	she will like the box once they come....I put the box in my bed it sounds crazy but that way she was close to me still at night and the puppies weren't actually in my bed.

Just keep an eye on her. When giving birth, the mother usually goes to a secluded space anyhow. When you're home...keep an eye on her and at night put her in the whelping box. When you're out of the house, confine her to a small room...and put the whelping box in the room you choose. However, you really should try to find a "dogsitter" for her while you're away.|`|tUDuVp3Taa	Try placing an old garment or towel with your scent on it.Place it in the whelping box.  We allow all of our small dogs sleep in bed with us-a personal choice.  All of our pooches are sterilized or very senior animals.  She should certainly alert you to signs she is ready to go into labor.  Please consider having a vet on call if you haven't already done so.  If not a professional breeder, maybe consider sterilizing after this litter.|`|RCqPYMr7aa	okay this is funny to me because my Pug is the same exact way and when she was preg. i was scared of that, she actually started to have one of the puppies on my pillow, it was so weird then we brought her on to the floor and she had the rest of them on my pillow on the floor... and NO i don't still have  the pillow i thru it away lol. but maybe putting her in a kennel at night might help that's what we did after she had them and boy did she hate it! so try kenneling her at night when the time gets close|`|asp4DaiHaa	i agree just put her in the box and tell her to lay down and stay and treat lol
owi3TGSBaa	I have had all and my favourite was the crested gecko by far.  The first reason is they do not need any type of lighting or heat, they need a cool humid environment.  The second reason is they feel cool crawling on you and they are awesome to play with.  The third reason is they do not need a big aquarium since they climb the walls and stuff.  Just my opinion.|`|rrFbQZzIaa	I have dragons and BTS but no crested geckos. the Blue Tongue Skink would always be my choice over a Bearded Dragon. Although Bearded dragons are not that expensive. I sell my normals for as low as $25 and as high as $50 and pet stores usually don't charge much more. Blue tongue skinks are typically more expensive that dragons, ranging around the $150 area at pet stores. If you're looking to get into Breeding, Blue tongues are not the best animal as they are not money makers. They have live birth so their litters are not very large and they may only have birth once every year, sometimes once every two years. It can also be very difficult find a male and female pair as telling the difference is extremely difficult. Unless you have a 1-2 yr old BTS, you probably won't be able to figure the sex, and even then, it can still be tough. Dragons are extremly easy to sex, breed and sell. I keep and breed blues b/c I think they are adorable. They are extremely friendly and extremely docile. I have never gotten bit or close to getting bit by any of my dragons or blues, but the blues are far more calm and gentle than Bearded Dragons. Crested Geckos to me are more like a display pet to me like a poison dart frog. It's all up to you of course, that's just my personal experience|`|31zCKATmaa	I honestly don't have a clue.

ak9DrBSwaa	Anytime you're housing multiple dwarf hamsters in the same cage, you should provide two seperate feeding and drinking areas. This is incase one hamster decides to stake out the territory with the food and water as "his" and won't let the other one near it.    You can simply sprinkle food in two areas of the cage if cost is an issue and save buying a second bowl (you may even have something in your kitchen that works!), but you should invest in a 2nd water bottle.|`|1YYmQI5Naa	Yeah. Unless it's a tiny bowl and the hamsters are hogs. That's fine though. :]|`|va8xvhthaa	Usually, yes, they do.|`|lTsDwY9Paa	Yes they will|`|xtRm5NV5aa	If they can live in the same space, they can definitely share food and water.

Rottweilers are generally big goofballs and non-aggressive. It's just that because these two breeds are *good* at fighting, some people train them and breed them to fight.     Neither of these breeds is bad in the whole, but a few from each breed can be. That's because some breeders take the most aggressive/territorial males and breed them with the most aggressive/territorial females, over and over... Animals have genetic components to their personalities just like humans do, and just like humans, environment plays a huge role as well.    Just get him neutered at 6 months to be safe. That will seriously decrease his likelihood to become aggressive, regardless of genetics.|`|ydshiNrKaa	He should be as sweet as any dog who is raised in a loving caring home.

KeevlZnTaa	The price will depend on where you purchase them and what color you get. A pet store is generally more expensive(some times double the cost), than a breeder. A standard gray will run about $130 from a breeder, but can cost about $250 from a pet store.     The average start up cost will be around $1000(cage, food, gliders, etc). Gliders need a very large cage, since in the wild they high in trees. The cage should be 3 feet wide, two feet back and at least 4 feet high.     The best place to buy a glider is from a reputable breeder. Search around your area, and look on the internet and see if you can find a local breeder.|`|0X4UXIBvaa	They are about $200 at a pet store but make sure you do a lot of research on them because they are a lot of trouble if you do not know how to take care of them properly.|`|f633886f4ab9993e966868c8e49ab87baa	just call petco and ask them.|`|Cfbue7Bhaa	It is easy to catch one but you would have to get a baby and it's not a good idea but you still could. Find an dead small oak tree with woodpecker holes and kick it over and get it. ORRR the best bet would be to get one from a licensed breeder or a pet shop. I would not catch a wild one as they may have diseases and could die without the certain nutrients. Look on the computer before you buy one and research long and hard about them. Your best bet would be to get it from a licensed breeder or pet shop.  Good luck!
3p6wp7DYaa	To train a dog to do what? Are you talking about housebreaking, tricks, basic commands, agility, what?!?    Whatever you are talking about, the best way to teach any new behavior to any animal is to use positive reinforcement techniques, including clicker training, treats, lures, shaping, etc.|`|mwVCFlLTaa	Clicker training!|`|Lkik9Sr7aa	train for what?...|`|xkzkCtrUaa	Depends on what it is. Listen Ive done my research and they all say: Say the command. Once the dog does what you want it to do praise it with excitment and treats. Then just keep on doing this over and over until the dog does it naturally|`|sPOmz9wUaa	The best way to train a dog is with love and affection. When you first get a puppy begin training him by rewarding him with affection instead of treats. Do this because you want to have control over your dog even when you dont have a dog treat. You must always be consistent. Do not scold your dog for chewing on a sock and then give him a rag. This will simply confuse the dog. Make sure you dog is well socialized around people and behaves. I also recomend training your dog teh 'mat' command. When a dog knows this command they will retreat to thier kennel and stay there. it is very helpful during parties. be consitent, affectionate, and never use violence to disapline it.|`|56C96CWlaa	idk!|`|Vff7kZmwaa	Watch It's Me Or The Dog on Animal Planet.

CtYqMs5Paa	I had a foster that had two full leg casts on her front legs, I was suggested the towel sling or holding her up to potty...didn't work she had to find her own balance, which didn't take all that long surprisingly! Maybe just give her a change to find her own balance with the "new" addition and it will happen.|`|DLXKmcG7aa	umm put a diaper on it lol|`|uQrIdrjfaa	srry cant help hope she feels better|`|ydshiNrKaa	Just let her get use to using the cast and stop picking her up.  She will get the hang of it in a short time.  My dog broke his leg and it took him maybe 5 minutes to get use to it and then he would go like crazy with it on.  Let her get use to it and stop picking her up.|`|zi3lq13faa	Your going to have to put her down in the grass so she can walk around and get used to the cast. then she will be fine.|`|KxjUim7yaa	When our Fritz broke his front leg we had to carry him up and down stairs. I took him out to the lawn. Ar first he peed and pooped near the house. But as the days went by, he got more confidence and went farther away.|`|SO20Ah2Daa	your gross|`|o1pXRFtUaa	if you think she has to go, put her down but hold her belly and kinda let her try to walk around.

I can relate to your situation.  One of my dogs, who is small, had  knee replacement surgery and her back leg was in a cast that went up to her hip for 6 weeks.  I was worried about her going to the bathroom too but my vet said not to worry because dogs learn to adapt to things in order to do their daily activities.  When I took her home, at first  I set her down on the floor.  I figured she could adapt easier learning to walk on a hard surface because with grass, the ground can be so uneven.  I put down some newspaper and at first she got nervous, not knowing what to do, but I got a few feet away from her and encouraged  her to come to me.  It didn't take any time at all that she learned to kind of drag the leg with the cast when she walked and found a way to stick the leg out when she had to go to the bathroom.  She also was able to walk and drag the cast on grass.  Just be patient.  Your dog will adapt and be able to walk and go to the bathroom.  One reason she may get upset when you put her on the grass, is that she's having pain from the broken leg.  If the dr. gave her any pain meds, give them to her as prescribed.  When she's more comfortable, she will try and adapt to walking with the cast.    I know it worries you.  Work with her and when she has to go she will find a way.  Dogs are very smart.  Best of luck to your dog and hope his leg heals.   Be patient.  Hope I helped.|`|AA11475634	set her down and hold her until she gets her balance. otherwise you can talk to the vet and see what they say?|`|YLsPYyi9aa	put dog food near the cast|`|5Mrrw5RIaa	I'm not sure... I think you have a problem there. Go to the vet and see what they do. I wouldn't be able to try and help my puppy, so I'd see a vet. It is the best thing you can do.    I mean... it may be hard for a dog to bend down. A male dog would be easier. You could try what they said, holding her up, letting her find her own balance, or a towel sling. But... I would still see the vet.

9759e8014743debd3d3fd1a7ad437c1faa	Because it's a Midas cichlid.  They are very aggressive and territorial fish, much more so than Oscars and even more so than Jack Dempseys.  The red snook is about as aggressive as the Midas, so apparently it's able to hold its own, at least for now.|`|3bf821ff353c216ffc93ff7a91b60828aa	Because they are very aggressive and territorial fish.  I kept mine with an oscar when they were young, but when I upgraded to a larger tank, that was it.  The midas/red devil beat the crap out of the oscar.  So, he's had his own tank every since.      And mine used to and still occasionally does, attack my hands/wrists during water changes.  I've actually had coworkers ask me what happened to my hands/arms because they were all scratched....the look on their faces was priceless when I told them my fish did it lol....    Now, your tank is overstocked.  I would suggest getting the midas a larger tank, at least a 55 gallon to himself.  In the meantime, you can turn the temperature down a tad, about 75-76F will help to cut down on their aggression because it's slows them down a bit.|`|fNqYbxrBaa	your fish feels it is king, and it feels dominant. take it out of it's tank and leave it in a fishbowl for a day. after 1 day, return it to your 75 gallon tank. if still attacking; do the same thing again but for 3 days. then return. if still attacking; sell it to your local pet store!|`|7DSqxCuAaa	First,midas are very aggressive fish.Second,that tank is way too small for all of those fish.75 gallons is suitable for 1 of those fish,not all 4.The midas has obviously become territorial and aggressive,and will probably attack all of your other fish until he kills them all or you get rid of them.I would talk to a LFS in your area and try to give all but 1 of your fish to them.

When he goes where he is supposed to praise him, excite him and give treats.|`|u3rmd1Oyaa	The training might take a bit more effort. I do not think your dog understands. Try repeating the training for a bit more and if you see her go in the spot that it is not for here tell her no and take her to her spot.

This may sound weird but animals get grossed out.     (EXAMPLE A cat can only go poo and pee in a litter box for so many days, then it gets grossed out and goes NEXT to the litter box.)     Your dog must be getting sick of pooping in his poop. That's why he is going elsewhere. This is disgusting but you should dispose of the poop ever few days so it can start fresh. Hope that helped!!!|`|yZImAkozaa	i mean, where would you like it to poop? lol    dogs usually don't like dumping a load in the same exact spot if they have other places to do it.    especially if its the backyard; a patch of grass is a patch of grass
5QG9Zrjaaa	From a dressage point of view, just getting her trained will be a challenge.  You speak of Spanish walk and Piaffe as if they are the easier dressage moves, when in fact they are the top ones,(olympic level) that take many years to become strong enough to do well.    I love drafts and crosses, but while mellow, they can be very strong willed.  At this point this mare knows she is bigger than you, and if she doesn't want to do something, she won't.    One thing you may be able to use to teach her tricks for Spanish Walk and Piaffe would be to use clicker training.  Google clicker training, horse and you will come up with Karen Pryer  (the queen of Clicker training) and Alexandra Kurland  (the horse lady) who do the best videos and books.|`|I8dkpUQ7aa	Yes omg what a gorgeous horse, especially with the percheron! she'll do great if she's a good learner and you work with her, age shouldn't matter at all.|`|Tw0rpc88aa	The Piaffe takes many many years to master. It is not just a matter of teaching a horse but building up the proper muscle. Many people think that they can teach it quite easily but it is an upper level movement, even the top riders in the world are constantly in search of the perfect piaffe.    Can you teach her to prance in place? Yes    Will she be able to learn a proper Piaffe?   - With a highly skilled trainer, yes.   - With someone who has never ridden dressage before, no. There is too much of a learning curve.    However, for your purposes as a re-enacter, she does not need a proper piaffe, a prance will be sufficient.|`|AA11137816	Well age is not a horrible thing, but it is quite old. If I were you I would look more into a younger horse. Yes, she may be mellow, but as (i think ponygirl was saying) if those horses don't want to do something, they don't! Also, piaffe is not just something with a tap of the wand and a few weeks of work can be accomplished. It takes SO long to accomplish that, let alone all the years it does to build the right muscle! The spanish walk shouldn't be too hard, but it still is going to be a challenge. The fact that she is 16 and not broken is a real big no-no. There are quite a few other very cheep nicer/younger horses that are broken and for sale right now due to the economy. Dressage is good for any horse at any age., i.e. I think Brentina who was at the Olympics with US rider Debbie McDonald is 17 maybe 18. Also if you guys are learning together, let me tell you, it is NOT an easy journey. All the ups and downs! Believe me I just wanted to sell my horse and quit sometimes! But in the long run it is so worth it! But maybe this just isn't exactly the horse for you. Expand your palate, maybe try out another horse or two. I truly hope this helps! And good luck!|`|OjeL1if4aa	IMO I don't think any horse is too old to learn or be trained.     If you're willing to put the time and the effort into it, go for it. Just be aware that to be able to perform the moves you are wanting they take YEARS of training and lessons.|`|w7Ma5KZcaa	yes it would be great to do dressage with her!|`|C8DOT8Y7aa	Yes she would be good at her age.
f9fb186e1c82bf7349b1e14dcbb1bcc4aa	No such thing as a mini Doberman.     All dogs need to be taken outside, and praised when they go. Crated when you leave the house and when you can't watch them..

tZxVey2baa	Call your vet and let them know whats going on. They may want to change his antibiotic, up the dose, or give additional medication. He shouldn't be acting like this especially not eating.To bring his strength back up buy a can of tuna and mix it in some canned cat food.|`|AA11171398	Are they antibiotics or steroids? There is a huge difference if they are steroids. Keep on the antibiotics, and try giving him canned food. I personally recommend getting California Natural, chicken and brown rice. But if you can't get to that ask your vet about buying Purina Mills, prescription I/D for cats to help settle his stomach. Mix it with warm water to help him want to eat it. He must eat to take antibiotics, they can really mess with his stomach if it is empty.    The ears need more antibiotics, ask your vet if you can give him 2 different ones at once. If he is on any kind of diet that has lots of starch, specifically potato, get him off. Potato makes yeast, a cause for many infections, go through the roof.    See what the vet says about the eye. If it is clear it could be stress. But both ears, eyes, and vomiting could be a sign of a bad reaction to the antibiotics. Definitely switch his diet to prescription I/D. It is not available at the pet store, only at your vets.     If that doesn't work then you may need to consider the alternative...I hope that helped.|`|v0txgzJEaa	Please take him back to the vet, obviously the antibiotic is not working and the infection has spread. He probably needs at least one injection of antibiotics. My cat was always horribly stressed at the vet's but got over it fairly quickly once I got her home and let her grumble at me.  It really depends on your finances (this could get expensive!), what the vet says and how long you are willing to let him suffer if you decide not to keep up the treatment.  My cat lived to 18, we probably spent a good $3000 the last couple of years of her life trying to keep her alive. And there is also the emotional stress on you and your pet. They are part of our family, so any decision is difficult. Go with your heart and sadly you bank account.
HBUO10i7aa	SIMPLIFY THE PROBLEM      80/400= 20/100= 20%  THAT WOULD BE LESS THAN 80/200= 40/100=40%|`|BdlGBdE5aa	Divide the bottom number 400 into the top number 80 and you get a 0.20.  To make it a percent % you times this number by 100.  So your answer is 20%.  Same thing for 80/200.  Divide the bottom number into the top number and you get 0.40.  To make it a % you times by 100 or 40%.   So, there is a greater percent of cats who have bad breath if 80 out of 200 have bad breath.  If you want to learn about pet bad breath see: http://www.orabrush.com|`|cii9XShcaa	Shouldn't this be in the Math section?  I don't know the answer but my cat doesn't have bad breath and I believe it's because she eats a raw diet.
EcKLqBnCaa	If you raise them as together as kittens, chances are they won't seriously fight. Make sure to get them spayed/neutered, because unfixed pets can show more aggression towards each other (especially males). Plus, unfixed cats are annoying (males will spray on your clothes and such, female cats will howl when they're in heat).
rXMTdUg4aa	If it has been an hour since the dog ate the pill and it just now threw up, the dog got the pill. It takes longer for food to digest than the  comfortis pill. Do not give another dose. Instead of feeding before or after the pill, put the pill right in the food. You can make a meat ball with wet food or some peanut butter to make it more appetizing. some dogs don't eat them plain. But yes they should always be taken with food.|`|uQrIdrjfaa	no she threw up use ur head|`|j1cyoB2gaa	I just gave my 14 wk puppy comfortis yesterday for the first time & she threw up too. I gave it about 7 in the morning & she started throwing up about 11. I am assuming since it was a few hours that her body did absorb some of the medication. I did not give it to her again because I didn't want her to have too much. Her vet did say to not give it on an empty stomach though so that is probably why ur baby got sick. Mine only ate a little before I gave it to her, but it must have not been enough. I had forgtten they said to feed her first until she started getting sick. She threw up about 3 or 4 times, but a smaller amount each time, she layed around most of the afternoon, and was fine by last night. If you are not sure about giving it again, then call the vet that gave you the medicine & see what they say.|`|xKcphGWIaa	of course u should have fed them first ...  u gave them the pill with them being with an empty stomach ..  jeez poor dog =/

4yt4D3vMaa	If it was me and I'd tried everything (have you tried petting it with a glove on the end of a stick to get it used to being touched?) and nothing had worked I would just keep it, feed it and let it live out the rest of it's life. If you give it to any animal shelter it's very unlikely to find a home and will probably be euthanised-I had a rat that was mean but I kept him(without handling him) and even paid vet bills for him until he died of old age.I just felt he was my responsibility and I knew he wouldn't get rehomed.|`|Mzjoeld4aa	figure out what exact actions create it to bite or however its being agressive then try to avoid the things you are doing or do it more slowly and calmly so it gets used to your actions|`|agS7LsZEaa	Try giving it to a Humane Society, they usually take any animal.|`|u1HahCoqaa	Well, if you cannot train it or get it to stop, theres not much you can do, assuming you already tried selling/giving it away.  You could put it down, or send it to a shelter.       You might think putting it down is cruel- but what are your options? Keep it, and have both parties unhappy, let it go, to suffer a long and drawn out death, or send it to the shelter, where it might find a home, but ultimately, if it really is as pet-unappropriate as you say, will be put down.     Whatever, your choice.
GTNnHgSPaa	Head tilt usually indicates an inner-ear infection.  You can put them on a round of antibiotics for 2 weeks, and it usually clears up within a few days.  (Though, you need to keep with the meds the full 2 weeks.) If you wait too long to treat, the ear drum can rupture and can cause a permament tilt.    It can sometimes be indicative of a tumor, but I personally would treat for inner ear infection before just assuming it's a tumor.|`|ZGLbVjgTaa	thats normal. he is comfortable mine acts like that also. dont be worried!|`|gGRccjlVaa	i had an iguana that did that about a month later he died!:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(

BjFat2raaa	A Savings Account for your dog is the BEST insurance you can get. Pet insurance companies are out there to make money.. like all insurance companies. And, like all insurance companies, they make it hard to get them to pay for things sometimes.    Call around and get a quote for your dog. Then just put that much money in a Savings Account just for your dog every month.. then it'll be there when he needs it without any hassles.|`|4yt4D3vMaa	It depends what country you live in-I went to a price comparison site and got various quotes before deciding what level of cover I needed and choosing the best value one. unless you have thousands to save a savings account isn't going to cover any real health problems as the cost of treatment rises every year and there are new treatments and tests available for pets that cost a lot, but with insurance you don't have to worry about the cost.

I hope is is not a living situation, because being a bully breed, it is a known fact that it is hard to find an apartment or house that will rent to a person who owns a pitt, rott, german shep, chow and so on.     Unfortunatly, pit bulls are a dime a dozen and rescue groups are overwhelmed as well as shelters and vet clinics (vet clinics will send turn them over to the shelters if no employee is willing to foster).    Your best bet is to find a friend or family member to adopt or foster, so you can get him back when you are able to figure out everything.

What I am trying to say is that there are MANY 1 yr old pits out there making it hard to find them homes. I would try contacting some kind of pitbull rescue or a no kill animal shelter. Sorry!I hope you find your dog a good home! And yes pittbuls can be the sweetest dogs, it is just that many know them as fighting dogs which gives them the wrong rep,!
GZ0sh4pmaa	ok well the only time you should b misting ur leopard gecko itself is if its having trouble shedding. instead you should be misting the hide not ur gecko.start by letting the leopard gecko get used to your face spend some time looking into the cage everyday. spend some time with it. then start by placing ur hand flat on the floor of the cage and let it sniff and examine you. do that a few times then move on to holding it, be careful not to close your hand to tightly around him it can make them nervous approach your gecko from either the front or the side. do that for 15 mins everyday till ur gecko becomes more comfortable with being handled.  TIP: if ur gecko starts hissing or trying to bite you, leave him alone for the day, it can be very stressful to them which can cause your leopard gecko to become sick.|`|CUFnorZyaa	It just takes a little time and patience. Give him a few days to settle in and then try to handle him a few minutes at a time every day.     You shouldn't really need to mist a leo. If anything make it a humid hide (http://pet-snakes.com/make-humid-hide) to use when it needs to.|`|McnuekTBaa	There is no such thing as "socializing" a gecko; they aren't social animals.  The most that you can hope for is that it eventually tolerates gentle handling.  Do not "pinch" it like the idiots at Petco suggest; rather, simply cup it in your hand. Cup your hand just enough so the gecko cannot jump off.|`|7ZsMMkp5aa	First of all, you should only be misting it so often, remember that it is a desert lizard I know that you may of heard that misting is good for shedding, but in my opinion, a humid hide is much better. Now for handling. For the fist week or two, just put your hand on the ground next to it so it can get used to you, and even if it walk onto your hand, put pick it up just yet. I know that it might hiss at you when you do this, but if it tries to bite don't move, it will feel as if it was in control, babies can't punture your skin. Hope this helps. Good luck!   *__*|`|ZpSqqeK0aa	I don't mist my geckos.  The only time I would do that is if they had a bad shed (the skin is stuck on the gecko and won't come off).  I keep a large water dish in the tank and the geckos walk through it from time to time.  I am still doing research on the best moist hide for them.    When I was working on handling my oldest gecko, I started by holding her just in the tank (putting her on my hand and holding it inside her habitat).  Eventually she was comfortable with that.    On the other hand, I have two juvenille geckos that, despite a lot of attempts, do not want to be held.      In my opinion, it really depends on the personality of the individual gecko.  I have to add that none of my geckos has ever hissed or tried to bite me.      Good luck!|`|E3VJAXDZaa	This site has tons of great info to help you out    http://www.reptilesexotic.webs.com/|`|dlWRc0BXaa	I remember when I first got my leopard gecko. He kept running away every time I got near him, and the first time I picked him up, I accidentally dropped him on the floor!     Don't worry. After about a week or so, your gecko will settle down and behave better around you. Eventually, you can even feed him by hand!
TJBFBRZuaa	I implore you, DO NOT LET YOUR PIGS MATE!!  This is an issue I feel most strong about. If a female guinea has a litter, then not only will she become aggressive towards other pigs, but she will have a shortened lifespan and will be put under much stress when she is separated from her young. Please, do not breed!    If, against all of it, you still want to breed, than only allow the male and female to mate, and then remove them to separate cages. Let the pregnant female have her own cage while she is pregnant, and do not let her around the male, as he will try to continue mating even though she is pregnant. When the babies are born (about 63 days), they are extremely independent. They can eat solids and do not really need their mother's milk, although they will nurse to around three weeks. You should not bathe a guinea pig unless your vet recommends you to. Babies can be handled, but VERY gently. Just be sure to get them socialized young.     Again, it is NOT a good idea to mate guineas. I would not in a million years put my pigs under that sort of stress.|`|vncsQEzQaa	guinea pigs should eave their mom at about 3 weeks.if not, then the boys will get their mom pregnant.unless the guinea pig is a boy,then you shouldnt introduce them to the father.if you do,wait til the baby is 3 weeks old.when my guinea pigs had babies, i touched them that day.guinea pigs are born ready to run and they have fur.if they cant run, the mom will eat them.if your goin to breed your guinea pigs, dont breed the mom if its a year or older.their pelvic bone would be full by then,and the mom will probably die, along with the baby. guinea pigs usually have 1-2 babies.i wouldnt recomend breeding relatives.|`|bEQn0Vrtaa	breeding guinea pigs is a very complicated issue, it appears you truly do not know a lot on the issue. Please do not breed just for the fun of it. First of all you run a 20% chance of loosing mom and all babes just of the top and there are many other complications that can happen. So just do not do it.

We had one inside the Walmart store on night. It came threw where the door greeter stands. She open the doorin the morning  to bring in baskets  it flew in to get out of the sun. I was told it roosted in the store till night time and flew back out the same way. I have bat houses outside. I live in the country. I have helped many injured bats. They are not really that bad.

zdu3gh8jaa	No don't get rid, give your original dog time to become accustomed to having the little one around. I have a 14 year old girl (well almost 14) and in July last year added a 10 week old puppy. The older one spent the first week looking at me as if to say 'Please take it's batteries out' Lol. After that first week, the older one became more settled with the little one. Make sure you don't allow your youngster to become too much for your older girl and remember to give the first dog daily quiet time without the pup being there even if it is just for half an hour.  Don't worry too much, they will soon settle down and start having fun together, just like my two do now - they are inseperable.|`|uQrIdrjfaa	idk my bff jill|`|DWvnIYTEaa	Are you sure that her drooling is related to the new puppy or did she get into something that she shouldnt have? I would consult your vet to rule out any health problems. As for getting rid of the puppy, I wouldnt. Your dog will adjust. Just give her lots of love and make sure the puppy doesnt terrorize her too much until they are used to each other|`|zeTGmB3faa	It's only been two days. Is the drooling part of the fear. Has your dog had his yearly vet check " Has the new puppy had a vet check. If they are fine, it is now your responsibility to take excellent care of both of them and teach them to get along.   I am concerned that you are already thinking of getting "rid" of a puppy after a short time. He is new and you haven't given it a chance or  much, if any thought. This should have been planned and tested already. This isn't meant to sound mean, but this is the main reason that so many dogs are in the pound....... A dog owner doesn't take the responsibility serious enough and doesn't commit.

xxtvhn5Naa	you should get a westie    West Highland White Terriers, commonly known as Westies, are a breed of dog known for their distinctive white coat. This breed is commonly recognised through its use as a mascot for Black & White (a brand of Scotch whisky), and on the packaging of Cesar brand dog food.      Westie Terriers have bright, deep-set eyes which tend to be dark, with a "piercing" look. Their ears are generally small, pointed, and erect.    They typically weigh from 15 to 20 lbs for male dogs and 13 to 16 lbs for female dogs and their average height is 9 to 11 inches (28 cm) at the withers. The Kennel Club has recommended that their tails, typically "carrot-shaped", should never be docked. The tail should be between 5-6 inches.    They also have deep chests, muscular limbs, a huge skull, a short and a closely fitted jaw with "scissors" bite (lower canines locked in front of upper canines, upper incisors locked over lower incisors).Their teeth generally appear quite large for the size of the dog. Westies have a very strong bone structure for their size.    They have a soft, dense undercoat and a rough outer coat, about 2 inches long, that requires regular grooming. Some Westies have "wheaten tippings" on their backs, though for individuals put forward for conformation showing this can be regarded as undesirable.    This breed is a non-shedding dog.    Their paws are slightly webbed and thickly padded.      They are very cute, have tons of energy, will not eat you, I've heard they get along with cats, AND they make very good Broncos fans!    EDIT: I've taken care of this kind of dog, they are very cuddly and fluffy.|`|6tGYe5roaa	I would have said a chocolate lab cause those are my favorites but they are huge.

UwplbhSsaa	Unfortunately you can only point your friends in the right direction, but there is no way that you can make up their minds about it because it is their dogs and their decision. Believe me I can totally relate being in the same position as you right now working on convincing a friend the same thing.    I would mention the genetic factors, the serious over-population problem, the risks to their own dogs by not being fixed (ovarian and testicular cancer). I can relate that they would love nothing more in the world then to continue on their dog's legacy because they love them so much. But is that really worth the risk of potentially having some of their offspring ending up in kill shelters, like so many other dogs out there. Ask them to consider can they really guarantee that their beloved dog's puppies will never end up in that situation? Or what about their puppies' puppies? And so on...    Just as you, I really do understand that they love their dogs, but ask them to reconsider and visit a shelter to see why they should have their dog fixed. Let them try walking a dog down the hallway for its last moments of life and try to explain to it why it was brought into this world only to be taken out of it while it still had many more years to live and love...only to be told no one wants you and we just don't have the room anymore to care for you so you have to go now :(|`|PM23RDycaa	The next time it comes up in convo - let them bring it up not you so you don't sound too preachy tell them to check out this website http://www.learntobreed.com/     "Friends and family" always says they want a pup but most if not all will change their minds by the time the pups are born or ready to go to their new homes.    http://www.geocities.com/learntobreed/tr...

The problem with BYB is that they can't see beyond the puppies that live at their house.  And can't fathom the reality that not all dogs live in loving homes.  And there is no way that they can guarantee their puppies won't end up abused or dead.      If they want to witness the miracle of birth, why shouldn't they head to an overcrowded shelter and witness the miracle of death, as the unwanted pups get euthanized.|`|SYrJiDKwaa	Mutts make better pets anyhow, and if they have homes for all of them, I don't see the harm.

I decided to let my dog, and the neighbors have pups.|`|UaQoFCxCaa	Can you point out all the health problems that can occur without spaying/nuetoring and during pregnancy/delivery?  That is sad if they won't listen about so many homeless puppies, because that really is the main reason.

kggedGcXaa	Well seeing as you have a 10 gallon tank then i wouldn't add anymore. A good rule when adding fish is 1 inch of full grown fish to 1 gallon of water. With goldfish it's 1 inch of fish to 2 gallons of water. So personally I think that you tank is a little over stocked if anything, males guppies get to be about 2 inches when full grown. Neon tetra's about 1 inch or so. ghost shrimp I've heard can get to be up to 4 inches, when full grown. and your snail will multiply like crazy. So if your not completely over stocked now you will be when your fish become full grown.   I hope I've helped.    Kim|`|hFyodb4Daa	I guess it would be ok just make sure to do weekly water changes|`|45Cbtd7raa	i guess its ok but there will be a lot of mess|`|rcWPdgiYaa	It depends how small they are and how big they will get.  You should have at least a gallon for every four inch fish!|`|wX9BHWGpaa	I am sorry but absolutely not! I am a fish care-taker. You may have an inch of fish per two gallons, and you have too much. Even if you take out few, they will grow to large. I suggest getting rid of alot or getting more aqauriums.

W02kTOqmaa	You could ask them. No harm in asking, worse they can do is say no. But do not REQUEST or expect it of them. They are already giving you a dog for free. They don't owe it to you. You are the one that wants the dog.    Just ask if they are willing to meet half way. Offer them 20$ or so for the gas. Doesn't really save you gas money, but saves you a few hours.|`|9ea79964f4ddad1359a8089c6729bb4caa	I don't think that would be inappropriate at all. If you are taking their dog, they should be happy to accomodate you.|`|ydshiNrKaa	Half way is usually the way most rescue groups will do it.|`|KxjUim7yaa	Yes I think it is inappropriate. They are already giving you the dog for free. And you think you should charge them (time and gas) to get it. I think you need to rethink the word FREE.|`|62bdfaff99eb94891a0098fdd62fe168aa	They are already providing a dog to you with out charge and now you want them to also send there time and gas to met you.

Also if your going to ask them to come down to  a meeting place you have to be sure that you will take the dog .  Hope i helped :)|`|mcymZfuAaa	ask them to meet you halfway|`|zWFJBlJZaa	It's a great question to ask but it may not be convenient for them to do. However, their answer will tell you how willing they are to have their dog in a good home and how much they actually care about the dog in the first place as it will make the trip much easier on the dog.    If you consider a half-way point, the dog will be with his familiars for half the trip and won't be as stressed.  When you meet the dog can be exercised and won't need to leave your vehicle until you hit your garage which will be much easier than having to stop halfway with a strange dog to exercise.  This is stressful for a transitional animal and is how some dogs get "lost" on the highway.|`|pQLoFQ8Saa	just meet in a town in the middle you drive 3:30 mi they drive 3:30 minutes
pTYbhKf5aa	I have three dogs and one of them had three bouts of pancreatitis.  We had to change everything about her diet.  She was eating Nutro. I'm not going to say that caused it, but she didn't have another bout after switching. I had other dogs that threw it up. So if your dog is not tolerating his food well, you might need to change it to a blend that is for sensitive stomach. After she was released by the Vet the first time,(and was cleared to start having things by mouth) she had to just drink some pedialyte mixed with distilled water for a day and then was gradually put on solids starting with boiled white rice and white meat chicken, also boiled, de-boned and skinless.  She ate this a few days and then gradually her  food was mixed in. Because she had a few more bouts, we switched blends to one that had no corn or wheat or glutens thereof, and no BHA/BHT and was more easily digestible.  We had to cut out all rawhides or any sort.  She has been healthy since her last bout which was about four or more years ago.   She is very healthy now, and since that last bout.  My dog already had a thin build and was not overweight.  She wasn't eating a bunch of fatty foods or anything, but the rawhides and hard to digest food seemed to take a toll.  All three bouts were severe, including bloody explosive diarrhea and vomiting.  She went downhill very fast and nearly died the last time.  I know that dogs that are overweight (not her) are more prone to pancreatitis.  Also, it more commonly occurs around the holidays when people are more apt to give dogs left-overs high in fat or gravies, etc.  We were never told our dog was on the verge of kidney failure, but she was on the verge of DEATH.  Strict dietary practice has seemed to keep another recurrence at bay.  Hope your dog will recovery fully. She did and she was very severely ill.  Wanted to add that the Venison and Rice blend that she eats is a lower protein food, and not lower fat than many blends.  Make sure your dog stays out of cat food if that is around. Also out of the garbage, away from left-overs, rawhides and fatty treats.  Any advice you decide to take, run it by your Vet!|`|d2191893763b20a6b077367a131978aaaa	There is a yahoo group called, I think, dog pancreatitis.

These dogs are normally high strung and nervous, she is  always shaking and barking ... They are known for being mean and biters so unless you get them as a pup it will take patience to change these areas of temperment. I will stop her immediately after she shows signs of meaness and will firmly state bad dog.. When she does good things I reward her..There may be a reason your dog doesn't like your boyfriend, he may remind him of someone that may of hurt him..Patience and kindness he will(boyfriend) show towards the dog, give the dog a treat, never show a dog that your afraid of it...  Good luck|`|2yWPmVt0aa	your dog is prolly jealous. maybe your dogs not use to male company. just give it some more time. tell your boyfriend to try to be more friendly to your dog lol. thats tha best advice i can give|`|YVNeeIIIaa	Word of advice: Always trust your dog|`|7stuXSLtaa	Have your boyfriend come into the house with your dog's favorite squeaky toy and lots and lots of chicken.

62bdfaff99eb94891a0098fdd62fe168aa	The reasons you are getting different answers is because different lines and differ net individuals are differ net.  How difficult they are to train will depend on what other breeds the trainers have to compare them to.  While I have never owned one myself - friends have.

This will help bring down her temperature if she is overheated.  Wet some towels, wring them out, and put them in the refrigerator for awhile then take them out and let the dog lay on them to keep her cooler.  Hosing her down with cool water is really a great way to keep her cool.|`|opjYENGGaa	I know what you mean, it's so hot in Melbourne. The heat is almost unbearable. My dog and puppy have been laying on the tiles (in fact they are there right now). Dogs pant to keep themselves cool so don't worry about that. What you can do though is get a couple of towels and wet them; squeeze most of the water out and put it down on the tiles for your GSD to lay down on. That is how I've been keeping my dogs cool these past few days. I also let my puppy had a little swim in our blowup pool; So yes, just make sure your dog has lots of cool water, a nice damp towel to lay on and stays inside.    Hopefully this weather passes soon because I can't stand it. It's 43 right now. :||`|X4NIyjUkaa	well all i can think of is put a fan by her and then give her fresh ice and water and evan try giving her just plain ice she if she likes it.
5knGTf5paa	no they will be fine, you just wont be able to enjoy them as well as if there was a light. and DONT put them near a window the water will naturally get overheated by the suns rays and cause an unsafe level of bad bacteria to breed in the tank. You basically boil your fish, and most fish do not need UV rays unless they are saltwater fish.|`|2Zb0eNfeaa	Sure, it'll be fine. Unless you're trying to grow plants, the light is only there so that you can see into the tank.|`|a2cjwMKcaa	Fish dont need lights, they can see fine by the normal room lights.

OGLulBtwaa	Kate C *Attackofthel:   be a little bit more extreme   if my cockapoo cost 1500 minimum she'd better poop gold  and i think these puppy mills would be the size of montana to fit 2000 dogs minimum with 500 pregnant. i do agree that puppy mills need to be stopped, but my puppies would have either gone to me or someone else. oh ps they're not mutts!!!! i know what i can expect buying a dog from a store, i can see who they come from and i know that they wont shed... their life expectancy... health risks... their pasts...things like that that you wouldn't be able to tell from a dog in the pound.    I have 2 cockapoos, an 9 year old male and a 6 month old female.   i can't tell you anyhting about a jack russel because i've never had one, but i cant imagine my life without a cockapoo. They are so cuddly, and sweet but they know when its time to play. They are very high jumpers and their ears flap when they do. both of mine have cropped tails, but i prefer it if they don't, so if you had the choice get one with a tail.

My little one opie is such a little princess, she loves her hair brushed, and she jumps in the shower with me.|`|76nTvO4iaa	Get a cockapoo.    JRTs are high energy dogs.

My friend has one and he is awesome; makes no noise, does a ton of cool tricks, and is adorable.

Not recommended for apartments.|`|26PPwzrWaa	So you want to pay 1500 min for a mutt you can find in your local shelter.   And no responsible breeder would breed mutts. They are only breed for one purpose, that is money.     Look into the recent puppy mill bust to see if the mill was producing poodle mixes. There are around 2000 dogs min. 500 dogs are pregnant and the rescue is expecting them to produce on average 3 puppies each. www.petfinder.com can help you find a poodle/cockerspaniel mix.     Jack russells are very high energy. You need to make sure the dog you get matches your lifestyle.|`|W4BvABL6aa	A Jack Russell, if given ample play and exercise can function in a indoor living environment very well. Ample time is more than most other breeds for the JRT.  Out side activity, for two 1 hour sessions per day is most likely a minimum. After given that they become beautifully docile in the home. Nothing Compares to their behavior when well taken care of.  You have to be patient and pro active in dog ownership with any breed.

7FGQ51A0aa	A hamster that has given birth should be disturbed as little or possible or she may become agitated and abandon, neglect, or even eat the babies. This means other than providing food and water, you should leave the hamsters and their cage alone as much as possible for the first couple of weeks. While it is tempting to look at the babies and make sure everything is okay, it is best to leave the mom to do her thing. Don't try touching the babies, I know how adorable they are but please don't. While it is okay to have a quick peek in the cage on occasion, avoid siting and watching for long periods. Wait until they are about 2 week old. Also, at 4 weeks old, make sure to seperate the male and female pups. (you could end up with a TON more if you don't!) The girls can stay with mom but the boys need their own cage. At 6 weeks they can be re-homed and will all need their own cages. Also, get the father out of the cage, as he could attack the babies.    What you could do with the pups (baby hamsters):    You could try keeping all of them - please consider though, this can get very stressful and VERY expensive. Remember, if your hamster had about 7 babies that means 7 more cages, 7 more packages of food, 7 more water bottles, 7 more cages to clean, ect.    You could donate them to a hamster rescue- they would probally try to adopt them out through their rescue and go through a few foster homes    You could give/sell them to friends or family- if you did this, you should make sure they have a stable home, nice family, and you are positive that they will get the best of care from their new owner. I would suggest selling the hammies to people you know, that way you are not dealing with total strangers.     I hope everything goes well with the birth!    Love,  Lucy :)    P.S.- If you have any other questions, feel free to email me through my profile.|`|ak9DrBSwaa	Leave them be - let mom handle them and they'll recieve the best care. It sounds like this was unexpected, so be warned that it would not be uncommon to loose some. Just let nature take it's course, mom will eat any that don't survive or cull them herself.    After pups have hair, eyes open and are wandering about the cage (normally with mom frantically trying to contain them) you can clean the cage. Never let mom see you move the pups - take mom out first - then take out pups and put them somewhere else so mom doesn't see you move them. Pups go back in a clean cage then mom is added back in.     Robos take longer to wean than most other hamsters 28-30 days http://www.hamsterific.com/SpeciesTable.... - after weaning be sure the little guys can reach the sipper tube of the water bottles.        From "Lucy the Hamster Vet" above  You could try keeping all of them - please consider though, this can get very stressful and VERY expensive. Remember, if your hamster had about 7 babies that means 7 more cages, 7 more packages of food, 7 more water bottles, 7 more cages to clean, ect.      *****************  Apparently, in all those years of vet school, she didn't learn a whole lot about robos. Robos are SOCIAL creatures and should live together. If you keep them, you'll need two bin cages - one for males and one for females and a back-up cage or two incase you have to seperate someone.|`|nmWztjGMaa	If the male is still in with the mom get him out.  Leave them completely alone until their eyes are open and they are walking around.  If it is her first litter she may eat them!  just be ready for that, if it happens.|`|oHKpy4IRaa	Sorry to say this but the title doesn't explain at all. I'm thinking that you are asking what to do because your dwarf hamster had babies and you don't know what to do.   Well, if that is what you are asking then there really isn't anything to it all you have to do is keep putting food in the food bowl and make sure that the mother always have fresh water. Also, make sure you DO NOT leave the male hamster in the cage with the mother and the babies because he will eat the babies. DO NOT touch the babies AT ALL. If you touch them then the mother will eat them. Don't move the mother and the babies from the spot they are in now either.    Good luck!!!
agS7LsZEaa	Some nice pets are:    Hamster:  Pro: They are cute, and always love you  Con: Their cages need frequent cleaning    Bunny:   Pro: the con is easily fixed by a higher-bottom cage  Con: They poop all of the time and it comes out of the wire in the cage    Turtle:  Pro: If you wash your hands after every play with them, they are very fun pets!  Con: They can carry salmonella    Rats:   Pro: They are cute and loving  Con: They fight with each other and have really long tails!    Fish:  Pro: They are usually very pretty and brighten up almost any room  Con: You can't play with them|`|BV7IatgYaa	How about like a chinchilla or a ferret :)|`|01j7Jx0Gaa	I have had a lot of pets!  I think by far the easiest is a small snake. Boas are nice.  They seem to live long lives and I think are really cheap to feed, compare to all my other animals.  Good luck! Happy pet hunting!|`|udLtA7T7aa	spider are Always cool to have  hermit crabs are very easy to maintain and are cheap  rabbits are cute cuddly and can buy some breeds for under $60  parrot they are cool and you can also teach them to talk  turtles are cool but can be a little bit boring as pets because they dont do much  ferret i had a ferret they are so cool because you can take them for walks and there really like a mini dog but cheaper.  Fish easy just feed them and clean out there tank fish are cheap but then you have to buy a tank  Hamsters/Guinea Pigs cute and sometimes poo or wee on you hehe  Mice/Rats they are usually easily frightened, and may bite if not handled properly.   Reptiles Quite often, these pets are considered perfect for younger children because of how easy they are to take care of.|`|psqkf6rMaa	rats are good also there are tailess rats and fish if you have the time you can train them

It might have the changeable gullet.  It will be wool flocked, which is good because it can be stuffed and fit to the individual horse.  (This is true whether it is Cair or not).    The really old Caprilli saddles don't have either Cair or changable gullents, and are still quite nice.  Well balanced and fun to jump in.|`|8rVodF9vaa	not sure how old you want, but there are lots of  pics here  http://www.saddlesource.com/search.asp  if the link doesn't go directly to the Caprilli saddles, just use the "search our store" function to find them.

Here is a response that I received from posting on CL:  hi there, i live right down the road from mcdonalds and im there a few times a week. no one dumped those cats there, they are all wild cats, they have been there 3 years that i have been living in kenly. i know exactly the cat you are talking about. they are very friendly to be wild cats. it would be nice for someone to take them in , but no one will. the spca wont help them either. everyone called the the mcdonalds cats. there is so many there.   but i just wanted to let you know that they have been there for years. i wish someone could at least get the females spayed so they wont keep multiplying.

rrFbQZzIaa	As a baby or juvi, they are way too fast to allow to roam around on their own. You may lost it easily. As they grow larger to 2.5 to 3 feet, you might be able to let it roam but only supervised. They are still very quick so you still might lose it. I would suggest if possible to keep it in a enclosed area even when it's out of it's cage, but each lizard has it's own personality so your savannah may not stray too far from home if you let it loose. When it's larger you may want to put a iguana leash on it and lightly hold on to the leash to test what happens the first few times. That would give you a idea of how much freedom you could give it but again, it will always need to be supervised. it's not like a dog in that fashion|`|jxtNodu2aa	Lizards are not like dogs, AT ALL.  You can't just leave them outside because they will eat everything and than you can't keep track of it's diet.  Also, in Mexico there are a lot of predators that could harm or kill your lizard.  Defiantly not an animal to let roam around by itself in the yard. But if your going to get one, remember: THEY GET VERY BIG.  Do you have the room?|`|NzSA6dmyaa	lizards aren't like dogs they dont form bonds or pack spirt like dogs do, while on the whole there friendly they shouldnt be but you should always been on your gaurd because they dont see u as a freind just not a threat. also it better for them to live in a stable environement it keeps them healthy|`|E3VJAXDZaa	This site has tons of great info to help you out    http://www.reptilesexotic.webs.com/

W0buucLsaa	It's not a breed. It's a mutt. These problems are common with puppy mill dogs.|`|nmWztjGMaa	It is a dominance thing.  Watch the Dog Whisperer!  It is a very common behavior issue and he is actually reacting to your reaction.|`|AA11171398	Aggression is apart of any breed.    Keep a leash on him while eating. Correct him when he growls with a quick tug, assertive stare, and a noise such as "shh" or "no".    Also, control his food. Have him on a feeding schedule and make him sit and wait for food. He should also be eating in a crate. No more chewies, he must earn them by not growling.    Take away his bed. If he is growling at you, he does no deserve it. In dog-language, he should be sleeping on the bed only because you allow it. He is guarding his bed from you because he doesn't think you are his alpha. He is taking the alpha role because he doesn't believe you are strong enough. By controlling his food and taking away his bed, you care taking control of him.
wuBIF9aPaa	to truly train a good personal protection dog by someone who is a novice is going to take you longer than your husband is deployed.  if you decide to buy one that is already trained they will be quite expensive.  (can run to 10K)   a good protection dog is NOT aggressive.  it is well trained and is prepared for certain situation in which it will act to defend its owner.  don't confuse that with a dog that will bite out of aggression/fear.      sure the breed matters, lots of breeds can be trained to be personal protection dogs.   rotties, dobies, german shepherds, etc etc etc   but i think you are better off getting a guard dog (dog that will bark to scare intruders aways) and maybe taking some personal defense classes    this one is for Tammy:  "May dogs that are trained to attack, are not good pets, they are dangerous around young children and small pets and must be labeled as a dangerous dog that means secure fenced yard, mussel ed in public, placing a sign on the fence warning of dangerous dog, they cost more to register, must be de-sexed and so on."    actually a properly trained protection dog is much safer than any other dog.  they are confident and stable and WILL NOT attack unless instructed too.    they are not fearful and don't bite out of fear (which is the number one reason dogs bite)   they are obedience trained and listen to their owner unlike your typical pet.  unless you train or have ever owned a personal protection dog please keep your uninformed conclusions to yourself    added: i would say breed not playing a role is an exception to the rule than a rule.  different dogs were initially bred for different reasons.  Labs have a very strong pray drive but many lack a strong defense drive.  training a dog that has a natural drive to protect is much easier than trying to train a dog that doesn't have such a drive.    btw if you are serious about training you need to get a dog from good lines.  genetics play a big role in what the dog will grow up to be.  don't go with purely show lines.  probability is they have all their working drive bred out of them. also you need to make sure parents of the pups you are considering are tested for genetic  problems.  many of the breeds that are used for personal protection have hip/elbow problems, heart problems etc.  getting a dog from sound parents is step 1 in training.  you don't want to spend thousands of dollars training your dog to than find out that he has a hip problem and can't train anymore.  puppies need to be properly socialized from day 1.  so finding a good breeder is very important.   training a person protection puppy is not the same as training a regular pup.  make sure you get it touch with the trainer from day 1 and listen to how you should raise and train the dog.|`|W0buucLsaa	I would get one of the naturally protective breeds. They don't need to be "trained" for protection. It's what they are born to do. They DO however need to be trained into obeying YOU so that they will not protect you from, you know, the UPS guy.     Great Pyrenees, German Shepherds, and Belgian Malinois are good breed picks for this purpose.    Oh, and there are tons of dogs and puppies of these breeds in rescues and at shelters that need to be adopted, including puppies. The money you save from adopting instead of buying can offset the cost of training.|`|rXMTdUg4aa	Adopt a dog because you love it... not to sick on people. If a dog loves you it will protect you and the house hold. At the very least it will bark when a stranger is present.|`|AA11171398	Breed matters somewhat, but not all. My rottweiler was a personal protection dog. You really need to think about if you can keep up with the maintenance of a PPD.  They all need to be mentally stimulated and socialized, their training kept sharp. They need exercise and lots of quality time. Shepard-like dogs need grooming daily, while rottweilers need a strong hand.   It depends on what breed is compatible for you...Belgian Tervuren, German Shepard, Dutch Shepard, Rottweiler, Mastiff, Doberman, etc.|`|iQDjdr2naa	first of all, no matter the breed, get a female. they are so much easier to train and so much more responsive on the whole. plus, males tend to run and get distracted and lose all focus when a female in heat is ANYWHERE within a few miles. german shepherds are great dogs. my personal favorite. protective, loyal and very very smart... which is why police use them. i recommend german shepherds. smart, loyal, great friends, protective. plus they are just plain beautiful. good luck!!|`|VYEJXGutaa	Don't get a dog for protection get an alarm system for protection! Get a dog if you want  lifelong friend and companion to love and take care of. Guaranteed any dog you get will protect you and act territorial of you and your home but don't get one specifically to be a guard dog! Thats how good breeds of dogs get bad names and sweet innocent dogs become violent problems! If you want a dog because you want a dog and you plan to take good care of him, socialize him with other people and animals, walk him everyday, play with him and love him then do so and he will probably guard you with his life out of love but if you just want personal protection while your husband is away get an alarm system and save the dog the trauma!|`|BWJyLZUYaa	most likely you wouldn't even have it trained for protection if you treat the dog right respect the dog the dog is going to be loyal and will protect you i don't train any of my dogs for protection they just do  it they are not mean but my rottie sits in front of me with his back to me facing our company i guess what i want to say if you treat him right hell be there for you it ll come natural for them if you train a dog to be aggressive that's where dogs get the bad rap from|`|ad09a262eea23aed99f3309da57c67c5aa	Talk to a canine officer about the in's and out's of having a protection trained dog.  Most will be honest with you about the amount of training involved, the need for the dog to work, the constant need for retraining to keep the dog safe and sharp, and the liability of having one.  Personal protection dogs are large strong, high drive dogs that require a lot of work and activity to be happy.  You can also talk to a person who does schutzhund or ring sport with dogs too to get an idea of the work involved in owning this type of dog.  Breeds include german shepherds, belgian maliosis, rottweilers, dobermans, pit bulls, cane corsos, and other large guarding breeds.|`|62bdfaff99eb94891a0098fdd62fe168aa	Any largish dog of a breed that has a reputation as a guard dog that is well trained so that it is under your control will give you a great degree of protection.  A friend and I use to stand outside the local place to get coffee well ofter the place had closed in a bad part of town - but she would get her Schnauzer out of the car and when ever the dog saw someone walking near by she would alert and everybody assumed that she would attack.  If she had thought that her person was going to hurt - she would have - if her owner had greeted the person happily she would have made a fool of herself wagging her tail,  I once had a Keeshond that I had at dog training class and I took a less with a schutshend trainer to help the dog get greater confidencee.  We discovered that if she thought the guy was coming after her she would hind behind my legs - but if she thought that the guy was coming after me she would be at the end of her leash barking.  That is what our life together was like for 15 years - I looked out for her - she looked out for me.|`|RFfTjnxzaa	Any dog used in the military will fit the bill.

May dogs that are trained to attack, are not good pets, they are dangerous around young children and small pets and must be labeled as a dangerous dog that means secure fenced yard, mussel ed in public, placing a sign on the fence warning of dangerous dog, they cost more to register, must be de-sexed and so on.  I have a male shepherd that gives a warning bark that sounds dangerous, but he really is a softy but I have no idea what he will be like if someone enters the property at night if he don't know them and say if i wasn't home, I have no idea how he will act but giving a warning bark and a dog that doesn't warm well to strangers would be a good start and is the safest to have especilly if you have other pets and children.  good luck in whatever you decide, and choose carefully.|`|PM23RDycaa	My two cents - a bat a security alarm a gun and some good mace. anyone willing to hurt you and break in will be willing to hurt your animal.    Go get a conceal and carry permit, take some gun lessons and protect yourself that way.    ADD: It takes time and money to train a dog into a proper guard dog and that means training for you on how to control the animal.    Most people are going to recommend GSDs, Dobes, Rotts and maybe a 'bully' breed or two. Some dogs are too friendly to make protection dogs obviously.|`|tPGxPDvBaa	To get a true protection dog costs thousands.  It requires a lot of training.

Unless you are committed to this animal it really isn't too good of an idea to get one just for protection.|`|KxjUim7yaa	Having a dog is a big commitment.
