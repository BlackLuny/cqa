Many motherboards have temperature sensors that will shut a computer down when it reaches a preset threshold. Converting video takes a lot of processing power, which causes the heating.

IbxhRebgaa	That made my head hurt. <br>  <br>  First things first:<br>  What exactly are you trying to do? <br>  <br>  If I understood correctly, your ultimate goal is to be able to connect to a wireless network with your Wii, yes? <br>  <br>  If that's the case, then I fail to see where your computer comes into the picture. <br>  <br>  Moreover, you don't connect an antenna to your computer. Whatever you bought, I don' think it's an 802.11 card.<br>  <br>  If you want to buy a wireless card, look for a PCI Express card. You attach this to a spare PCIe slot in your motherboard. It's not really an antenna though...<br>  <br>  To be able to use your PCIe wireless card, however, you will need a wireless network to connect to. Perhaps you already have one. I can't really tell. If you don't have a wireless network, however, but you do have an Internet connection, then you can create a wireless network by purchasing a wireless router. <br>  <br>  Finally to your Wii. I do not own a Wii, so I cannot say for certain, but I have been told by others that the Wii has a wireless card installed in it out of the box. This means that you can connect to your wireless network with your Wii once you've purchased and set up a wireless router. This will allow you to play your games online with people around the world. <br>  <br>  Just to reiterate though, your computer and your Wii are two separate devices. You don't need to have a wireless card in your PC for your Wii to be able to get online.

There’s a decent guide covering this that you can work through at My Slow PC (<a href="http://www.MySlowPC.co.uk/)" rel="nofollow">http://www.MySlowPC.co.uk/)</a> – click on the “Troubleshooting” link.  Here’s my advice from it:<br>  <br>  1.) Turn System Restore OFF so any infection that you remove is not restored.<br>  <br>  2.) Scan with a combination of the best detection utilities as you’ll find different scanners can sometimes pick up different infections.  E.g.<br>  <br>     * McAfee Stinger – a free stand-alone utility used to detect and remove specific viruses.<br>     * SpyBot Search & Destroy – a spyware/adware scanner<br>     * Lavasoft Adaware – for spyware/adware<br>  <br>  Note – it might be a good idea to disconnect your network connection once you’ve updated them with the latest virus/spyware definitions.  This is due to the fact that often an infection is trying to spread over your network.<br>  <br>  3.) If the above fails or you’re not sure if you’re still infected, when you start your PC tap the F8 key, select “Safe Mode” and repeat the scans once you’re connected.<br>  <br>  I hope the above helps, as mentioned the guide above is a lot more detailed and the My Slow PC site is pretty useful.  Good luck!

xTo1dnLKaa	Well, it's hard to troubleshoot what you're doing without more information... but the default render settings usually don't have audio output enabled.  Yes, it should be turned on in your composition, but here's how to enable it in the render queue:<br>  <br>  After adding your comp to the render queue, click on your output module settings (not the triangle, but the actual preset you can click on to the right of the arrow--lossless is usually the default) you have to enable the audio output.  it should be at the bottom of the window.  There, you can choose all the standard compression and bitrate settings you're used to when exporting from other programs.  <br>  <br>  I've never exported anything from after effects and can't think of any circumstance off the top of my head where the render queue wouldn't be more useful once you get the hang of it.

I haven't talked with the guys I went to school with that went into ME in years, but I never recall them ever being Mac based.  I would figure you'll need access to Windows in one form or another.  Now with a modern Mac its easy enough to use Boot Camp to do a dual boot of Windows your Mac.  But I do think you would need to do that.<br>  <br>  I think either laptop is fine for your needs though.  Just get as big a hard drive as you can afford if you do go with a Mac.  That way if you do end up doing the Windows dual boot install you can give a decent amount of space to both operating systems.<br>  <br>  I like the Pro over the regular model simply for the firewire port and express 3/4 slot.  Both of these can come in handy for peripherals.  Firewire is good to have for some hard drives and is good for having to connect certain peripherals (some cameras and printers will use it).  The Express 3/4 is handy because you can buy adaptor cards for a variety of things (eSata, more firewire, more USB, etc.).<br>  <br>  If price isn't too big of an issue then you can stick it out with the current Pro models.  But if price is a concern, take a hard look at the last generation MacBook Pro models in the Apple Refurbished store and being liquidated around online at places like Amazon.  They are quite close in performance actually and you can score one for like $1000 less then what you would pay for a current gen MBP.  Just a thought.<br>  <br>  Overall though, if you can't really see a reason to make use of the Firewire or Express Card slots, then with the current line of Mac laptops there isn't a huge value in going to the MacBook Pro.  It's kind of a bizarre move by Apple frankly as until now there was quite a bit more separation between the Pro and regular lines.

The AMD Black Edition 3.0 is a quad core. <br>  AMD is the cheaper way to go, mostly because they are playing catch-up to Intel and are selling their processors at very low prices. A lot of their processors still use the 65nm architecture while Intel has had processors out for a couple of years that use a 45nm design. Intel is currently working on a 32nm design, while AMD only recently came out with a 45nm design.

You may have set the jumpers incorrectly, or connected them to the cable in the wrong order if they are on cable select mode.

lRvy9L1Jaa	This is a technicality that's been catching a lot of the people in the UK out too: when the service is advertised as 1500kbps, it means kilobits per second.<br>  <br>  There are eight bits to a byte, which is what file sizes are measured in. So to get the actual kBps (the capital b means byte rather than bit) for your connection, divide 1500 by 8, and you'll get 188 kBps. This roughly matches your 200kBps speed that you give, so I think you're just getting your bits and bytes inadvertently confused :)

0qN4IStOaa	as long as you do not exceed your bandwidth no.  each file is dependant on how many people are sharing|`|ERfL13kFaa	it depends on your connection... if incoming torrent data is using up most of your bandwidth at the time then downloading more torrents will slow down the process overall. However if the torrents you are currently downloading are running fairly slow then they are likely being limited by the speed of the tracker and other peers for that torrent. If this is the case then downloading multiple torrents should not impact the speed of any individual torrent (provided you have reserved enough incoming and outgoing connections in your torrent client)

There’s a decent guide covering this that you can work through at My Slow PC (<a href="http://www.MySlowPC.co.uk/)" rel="nofollow">http://www.MySlowPC.co.uk/)</a> – click on the “Troubleshooting” link.  Here’s my advice from it:<br>  <br>  1.) Turn System Restore OFF so any infection that you remove is not restored.<br>  <br>  2.) Scan with a combination of the best detection utilities as you’ll find different scanners can sometimes pick up different infections.  E.g.<br>  <br>     * McAfee Stinger – a free stand-alone utility used to detect and remove specific viruses.<br>     * SpyBot Search & Destroy – a spyware/adware scanner<br>     * Lavasoft Adaware – for spyware/adware<br>  <br>  Note – it might be a good idea to disconnect your network connection once you’ve updated them with the latest virus/spyware definitions.  This is due to the fact that often an infection is trying to spread over your network.<br>  <br>  3.) If the above fails or you’re not sure if you’re still infected, when you start your PC tap the F8 key, select “Safe Mode” and repeat the scans once you’re connected.<br>  <br>  I hope the above helps, as mentioned the guide above is a lot more detailed and the My Slow PC site is pretty useful.  Good luck!
j6MyoCluaa	Yes you are going to need to use something called Anti-Virus Software. Your computer is all messed up because when you download things that are illegal you get something called viruses.

1217200f8a7bd6b46b73eeb9ce169cbdaa	Need more info. Are you saying, you have 3 operating systems on your computer? If so, why delete one? If you need more room, add a HD. I have 4 OS's on mine. XP, Vista, Windows7 Beta, and ubuntu just to play with( it's kinda worthless)                 OK, so if you have XP installed 3 times, that's strange. Try this: click Start>right click Manage>click Disk Management>right click on one of the partitions, and select Delete Volume. It may not let you delete it, because of the boot sector. If it denies you access, the only way is to reinstall XP, and delete all partitions into unallocated space. then create a new partition. Make it 30,000 MB, and leave the rest unallocated. When your done installing Windows, and everything is updated(Windows Update) return to Disk Management, and right click on the unallocated space, and select Create a New Simple Volume. Format it, and your done. Put all files and downloads, and even games on this Volume. Only install Utilities, Anti Virus etc. on the XP partition. Leaving the OS on it's own partition, will allow the computer to operate more efficiently. Plus if you need to reinstall windows, all your files and downloads will still be there. You will have to reinstall your games(put them in the same folder they were in) but any progress you had will be intact.|`|tQTXaPamaa	you have to format your drive.<br>  (delete EVERYTHING on it.)<br>  <br>  There are programs to "nuke" your drive.

yWvkXrtsaa	The fact that you have windows vista is not a factor in this problem. This is a hardware problem.<br>  <br>  To troubleshoot the problem, remove the battery from the laptop and plug in the charger. This should cause the laptop run on the charger's power, since there is no battery. If your laptop doesn't turn on, that means that your charger is defective. In other words, you need a new charger. However, if your laptop DOES turn on, that means that you have a defective battery, and need a new battery..<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|af3a28b07826dce8ecfc28a5eaa91e13aa	Dell's have problems just like all other man-made devices.

SJM0rzHtaa	You don't need a real powerful PSU to drive that 9500GT.<br>  <br>  The 9500GT is a pretty weak card which draws less than 75 watts under full load.  Note it does not even have the 6-pin power connector that more powerful cards have.  Only PCIExpress cards that draw more than 75 watts of electrical power are required to have the 6-pin.<br>  <br>  Heck, you can SLI two of those 9500GTs using just a 500W PSU (which is kind of pointless because you can get a single card that is much faster, like a GTX280).<br>  <br>  If you are putting that 9500GT into an existing computer with a typical 300W PSU, it will work without a PSU upgrade.|`|h0hSIgC1aa	That power supply has four +12v rails rated for 18A max, but the combined +12v output is 52A (or 624W) it is very impressive.<br>  <br>  However, for a 9500GT it is overkill - unless you have factored in your future power requirements over the next several years, then that unit is an excellent choice.<br>  <br>  Galaxytech is assuming a high-end system with that 9500gt, from your manufacturer link:<br>  <br>  "    * Minimum 400W or greater system power supply (with 12V current rating of 26A)*<br>  <br>  *Minimum system power requirement based on a PC configured with an Intel?

In most cases the marketing suits want it that way so they can cover their a** and not have customers complain about underpowered power supply units.<br>  <br>  Personally, if you are not upgrading for an uber-system with that 650W this one should do nicely<br>  <br>  <br>  SeaSonic SS-350ES 350W  <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817151038" rel="nofollow">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...</a><br>  $47 (+12v@324w/27A  <a href="http://c1.neweggimages.com/NeweggImage/productimage/17-151-038-07.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://c1.neweggimages.com/NeweggImage/p...</a> )<br>  <br>  Since it has a +12v combined rating of 324W, simply do 324W/12V = 27A, and according to galaxytech it will power a system with an Intel?

I recently installed a NVidia 9600gt 512mb GDDR3 video card into my system, which only has a 250watt power supply. Only video cards above the 9800gt range need an increased power supply to run properly.<br>  <br>  Any computer that you buy with a PCI-Express slot (1.0 or 2.0) in it will have a power supply capable enough to run that video card.<br>  <br>  On a different note, do not be worried if you don't have a PCI-Express 2.0 slot for your video card. PCI-Express 2.0 video cards are backwards compatible and can run in PCI-Express 1.0 slots.

e7aec0810de3f4d53534a144f9b3df12aa	I'm not an expert but I have a couple of suggestions:<br>  Try changing the time on the settings to 3 minutes, and wait without touching the computer for that time. Otherwise, try also playing with the "power options" (see Control panel); there are options there for password requirement, power plans, when to turn off display (along with the screen-saver), and changing when the computer sleeps. I really don't see why these tools can't be enough. You should just be able to control it from the screen-saver window. If the computer doesn't sleep, you should consider taking it for someone to have a look at it. Best of luck.

Comodo is a high rated firewall but you have to make all the calls. I would have like it better if it could tell a good program from a bad one. It just stop them all and you have to make all the calls. If an antivirus software did that no one would use it. I gave up on Comodo, after some time it still had pop ups all the time.

81pm9Ckoaa	They are reliable. They are hosting over half a million websites right now. The reason not to get hosting from them would be if you want to have one click install of Wordpress or some other popular CMS software which are very popular for blog type sites. Basically you just install it, choose a theme, and start adding content. The other reason would be that they don't offer a lot of options like some other top shared hosts. But if you don't need more options than what they offer, they should be OK. <br>  <br>  I would choose Powweb hosting.<br>  One of the biggest reasons would be that they offer unlimited domain hosting, which means that you can host multiple domains (websites) on the same account with no additional price (just the price of domain name registration) so you can easily add some other sites. They offer a lot of options and one click install of couple of dozens popular software packages like Wordpress, forums, ecommerce solutions, photo galleries and a lot more. Price wise they have excellent offer right now. They're on a 50% sale - $3.88/month ($46.56/year), and you get a free domain from them.

And if they do get viruses its not just one mac it means that pretty much everyone mac will get it and it will make the news because macs dont get viruses haha there was an one time i think 3 months ago that macs go a virus but its not even a real virus because viruses are programs that attack dos which is the soul of windows vista or xp. and well safari doesnt have dos its just a simple program. thats why they dont get viruses<br>  <br>  3) macs come out of the box ready to use!! no need to really install anything! all you need to do is set up ur username and stuff like that<br>  <br>  4) they last extremly long! the number 1 reason why pc's go out of date so fast is because microsoft comes out with operatiing systems like vista! which means old computers needa get new processors,ram and hard drives! its a pain<br>  but whenever apple creates a operating system they make old apple computers to run faster! and thats there goal. because if they can make old computers run faster! then the new computers will be extremly fast.  and also pc's get viruses so thats what also makes them outdated and stuff<br>  <br>  5) macs have the highest resell value on the market<br>  <br>  6)macs just look good and have a good battery "8 hrs" but thats really probably only 4 or 5 hours really but still only the high in laptops come that way but apple gives them to you with all there laptops<br>  <br>  7) macs have cool features and its what the big guys use to make movies! and edit pictures and music type stuff

Instead, scroll down the page until you see the text 'PDF Snapshots' There will be a bunch of flags for a bunch of different countries listed there. Select the flag that most closely resembles the one where people speak that same language that you do (if you're in the US, use the British flag) and RIGHT click on it with the mouse. Now select Save Target As... And you have just downloaded the complete documentation for how to use GIMP.

SJM0rzHtaa	I'm using a 52" LCD HDTV as my monitor, displaying 1920x1080 resolution (aka 1080p High Definition).  Looks just fine to me.  <a href="http://i50.photobucket.com/albums/f347/armchairaviator/computer/IMG_0880c.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i50.photobucket.com/albums/f347/a...</a>|`|a00a78740b4cb65d519bfb84e169590eaa	There is no "too big" for a certain resolution.<br>  <br>  These days, most larger monitors are LCD monitors and they have what is called a "native resolution".<br>  <br>  That is the resolution the monitor should be set at.|`|AA11622701	Depends.  If you are sitting 18" from the monitor, everything would be huge and probably difficult to read (blurry).  However from a short distance away it would look fine. Also depends on the quality of the video card in the PC.  Also depends on whether you have good or poor eyesight.  <br>  <br>  But for a monitor of that size, you would probably want to go with a higher resolution that 1920x1200.|`|WsqlA3owaa	Not a problem! And it's standard for a good flat panel monitor. I just bought a 28" and it's great. Hey, by the way, I read (and from experience), flat panels only last about 2 years before needing repairs (which is affordable, I think) but buy a warranty. I did, not going to  get caught in that trap  again.<br>  Best to  you!|`|1422614376bd2aaa1c3c2bd0bf16d2deaa	On a 27" LCD Monitor for resolution of 1920X120 will give a pixelate effect from the closer look.<br>  Such a large screen looks better from a distance. Better you think for 21" or 24".

Often times there is a switch that you can use on the exterior to enable and disable the Wireless radio broadcast.

gzaVGE4Qaa	Here's an easy how to on emailing pictures to cell phones.
3jjS6f0Vaa	Because using assembly makes you think about the underlying hardware more, and you'll learn to write more efficient code. Then when you move back to C++ or whatever high level language you use, you'll be more wary about what high-level constructs you use, because you'll have learned how costly they are while learning assembly, and you'll hopefully be writing faster, more efficient code.
kWxhWET7aa	programming languages:<br>  C/C++, Assembly (to better aide your C/C++)<br>  <br>  scripting languages:<br>  HTML, JavaScript, VBScript, Python, Perl, Ruby, lua,<br>  <br>  The list is endless. The more languages you know, the better you are to your potential employers. Once you get the hang of one language, you should be able to bounce into another with less difficulty. And, you'll eventually find the ones that you're with which you're comfortable. Gain as much expertise in these as possible, but keep your skill up with the other ones as well. You never know which one you'll need for which job.
2RQ4qDhXaa	SDHC can hit 32GB right now.<br>  <br>  SDXC isn't really a solid state hard drive: it's a true flash card. I heard it's probably going to be capped at 2TB when it's released, but I wouldn't be surprised to hear they have a 4TB in development.<br>  <br>  The problem is that current hardware can't read SDXC yet. It's like when SDHC came out - older card readers and cell phones can't read the cards. We'll have to wait until the hardware catches up to the new format befroe we start seeing it used every day.<br>  <br>  There's a brief mention of the technology here:<br>  <a href="http://www.maximumpc.com/article/news/computer_data_storage_through_ages?page=0%2C5" rel="nofollow">http://www.maximumpc.com/article/news/co...</a> and here's more right from the SD site: <a href="http://www.sdcard.org/developers/tech/sdxc" rel="nofollow">http://www.sdcard.org/developers/tech/sd...</a><br>  <br>  No release date yet though.|`|Ru04BGdVaa	<a href="http://www.engadget.com/2009/03/06/pretec-32gb-sdxc-666x-cf-card-and-64gb-expresscard-ssd-eyes-on/" rel="nofollow">http://www.engadget.com/2009/03/06/prete...</a>|`|HtfqFgEgaa	Yes, Radio Shack said it is for video on a high frame rate camera.

h0hSIgC1aa	I have read about the auto-speed problems with 8600gts, the problem is the fan does not increase the speed on high temps until it reaches 80+C!!<br>  <br>  So a good fix is to get the Nvidia "ntune" utility and force the fan speed to 100%.

AA11622701	Because of the way an IM program works, it has to check frequently for any messages come to it.  In facts several hundred times a second.<br>  <br>  Multiple that by all the people within a company (which can be hundreds) and the amount of network traffic needed to keep such a system operating would be impossible for most companies to handle.<br>  <br>  Plus as soon as you open up a "IM" system with the rest of the world, you know that everybody is going to be chatting with their friends and relatives instead of working.  Look at how many messages are posted here every day from people wanting to know how to access IM etc from work.<br>  <br>  Then there are legal issue.  If an employee were to use the companies chat to do something illegal, the company could find itself sued for not monitoring and blocking such messages.  (Happens all the time.)<br>  <br>  Also IM programs leave the company open to virus attacks, spyware, hackers, harassment, etc.<br>  <br>  Even if a company was to only up one line for IM messages, it means paying someone to sit at a computer all day and answer such messages.  Another expense to the company.<br>  <br>  As someone who is deaf and unable to use a phone, it would love it if such communicate was possible.  But there are simply too many reasons why it is not practical to do.<br>  <br>  However, many large companies do have an option on their web site where you can establish a secure chat session with their support people.  I often use look for and use such options.  Or if all else fails, an e-mail where you can often get help and answers.  (Especially if like me you can explain that you are deaf and unable to use a phone.  Often they will assist you with problems by e-mail.)

j6MyoCluaa	Yes you have some pretty bad neighbors. The good news is you can stop them. First off you need to set a password that stops them from accessing your router. You can do this without the software. So go onto your Mac and open up Safari or the web browser that you use. Now type in "192.168.1.1" in the top of the address bar. Now a window should appear and ask you for a password. As long as you have just reset your router the password and username will be the default. It varies for every router  but try some of these combinations. user:admin pass:password<br>  user:      pass:admin   user:     pass:1234       user:admin pass:1234<br>  If none of these work you will need to go the support section of Linksys website and find the exact model that you own. Then it will tell you what the default password is. Now once you have entered the correct password it will bring you to a page with all the settings for your router. You will need to look around for a place to make a password for the router settings itself. Once you have added that password HE will not be able to change any settings. Now you need to put a password on the internet connection itself. Now you also can do this at the same page as the router password. You will need to find a place to add a WEP or WPA network key. I would WPA because it is more secure, but the truth is that he might still be able to get in. Once you have set a WPA password you can log out of the settings page. Now that is all you can do to protect yourself. But you can use a program called Wireshark to track who is on your network. If you find a MAC address and an IP address you may be able to press charges on you neighbor if you want.

I have a Mac and the Linksys thing didn't work either. But I think I can help.<br>  <br>  Just a note first: It is possible for someone to set the password on your router. If there's already no password on it, they can log on to the router administration page and set up a password. To get rid of the password, either hard-reset the router OR plug your laptop directly into the router.<br>  _________<br>  <br>  First, I recommend turning off the airport on the MacBook Pro and plugging it directly into the router. The Linksys should have come with a small blue ethernet cable (mine did). So plug it into one of the ports labeled 1-4 on the router and the other end into your ethernet port.<br>  <br>  Then go to your network settings (advanced tab). It should give you the address of the router (probably something similar to 192.168.1.1).<br>  <br>  Open up Safari or another browser and type in 192.168.1.1 (or whatever the router address was in the network settings). It SHOULD ask for a username and password. If it's not supplied in the user guide, go to <a href="http://www.routerpasswords.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.routerpasswords.com/</a> to find the default username/password.<br>  <br>  That should log you into the Linksys configuration page, where you'll be able to set password protection settings (I recommend WPA or WPA2 instead of MAC address filtering).<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!

You can change the structure of a web page, but not the source code of a page.<br>  <br>  You can alter the page in memory. For instance, I can add a lot of things to the displayed page with Javascript, but the page source will remain unchanged. There are only two ways to alter the HMTL that comes from the server. <br>  <br>  1) FTP a new copy of the file. (Outside the scope of Javascript)<br>  2) Generate the original HTML page with a web application.<br>  <br>  I'm afraid if you want to alter the page source, you're going to have to dig into a more difficult language than Javascript.

zorYTX59aa	If you want to be able to see YouTube videos <br>  in HQ or HD, here's the determining 'X' factor:<br>  <br>  1 - if you set your "video playback quality" to<br>  "dynamic", you should automatically see the <br>  option for HQ/HD instantly on your screen (if <br>  the video is indeed HQ enough).<br>  2 - if you set your "VPQ" to "slow", then you<br>  will never be able to see that option;<br>  3 - if you set it to "fast", then any videos that<br>  come on your screen should theoretically be<br>  already in HQ/HD (whenever available).

BhNP2P8Xaa	Desktop computers do NOT come with wireless adapters by default. The "suggestion" that you look for a wireless connection is just some generic response. You probably (in fact, I'd say definitely) do not have a wi-fi card. <br>  <br>  Is the computer in the same room as the router? If so, just go out and buy an Ethernet cable long enough to reach from the desktop to the router, and plug it into one of the LAN ports on the router (and the other end into the Ethernet port on the desktop...which I'm certain you have). <br>  <br>  Then check for a connection. Viola.<br>  <br>  If you're too far from the router for hard wire, get a wireless network adapter for the desktop.|`|TpMvr1pyaa	my peers are correct; you must find out<br>  how you are connecting to the router.<br>  I have two PCs and a laptop.  I have the<br>  PCs connected via wires to the router<br>  cause they do not have internal wireless<br>  connectivity components but the laptop does.<br>  <br>  So, on the back of the router, <br>  I have 2 wires, one from each Pc<br>  AND the wireless laptop connects itself.<br>  <br>  SOMETIMES, the laptop does not find the<br>  signal and i have to reboot ONLY the<br>  router [by pusing a reset button <br>  on its back].<br>  <br>  So, you must first determine how your<br>  PC is supposed to send a message--<br>  signal--to your router.  IF it has a wireless<br>  card, you are ok.  A wireless card is<br>  something that is obvious with a mini<br>  antenna plub sticking out of the front or<br>  back of your computer........but likely<br>  you will need to either--<br>  buy a wireless card for the PC or<br>  connect up to the router via a wire.|`|1422614376bd2aaa1c3c2bd0bf16d2deaa	You dont have the wi fi card in your computer to connect with the wireless router.

zorYTX59aa	You will get absolutely nowhere messing around with "Java", <br>  "Flash" or different web browsers.<br>  <br>  None of those things will help you, because your computer <br>  and YouTube were working perfectly fine a while ago, right? <br>  The first rule-of-thumb and best option should ALWAYS be:<br>  don't disable, erase, uninstall, switch, download, alter, add, <br>  change or install anything. That'll only make matters worse.<br>  <br>  I'm 100% positive both your "JavaScript" and "Flash Player"<br>  are fine. Nothing about watching YouTube videos has really<br>  changed in the past couple of years. If anything, the newer<br>  Flash Players have been known to give many YouTubers a <br>  lot of trouble, especially all 5 variations of version 10. (Why <br>  in the world is there a 10.0.525, 10.1.218, 10.2.26, 10.2.54<br>  and 10.12.36? The only thing that most upgrades are good <br>  for is their potential to create all kinds of software conflicts).<br>  <br>  Your problem may fix itself within a couple hours, or by the<br>  next day, because YouTube often "shuts down" a bunch of<br>  their own servers every single day without warning anybody, <br>  in order to update all kinds of stuff. During those occasions, <br>  it's really YouTube's data transmissions of "Java" or "Flash" <br>  that are poor -- not yours.<br>  <br>  If, by the following day, YouTube is still stuck and showing<br>  you those awful "JavaScript" and "Flash Player" messages, <br>  it'is possible that your subdirectories of "temporary internet <br>  files" and memory (many times called "cache") are entirely<br>  maxxed out and can't take anymore -- the end result being<br>  that YouTube videos cannot even make it onto your screen.<br>  <br>  "Temporary internet files" are 1000s of tiny bits of websites<br>  permanently put on your computer's hard-drive. They'll stay <br>  there forever and ever, gradually plugging up your computer <br>  much like hair slowly clogs a sink drain, until you get rid of <br>  them. The solution to that is to first exit YouTube and clear<br>  your "cache" of all its "TIFs" as well as your "cookies" and<br>  and "history". Then reboot.<br>  <br>  Note 1: if you've got Google Web Accelerator or something<br>  similar to it...dump it, burn it, trash it, disable it, uninstall it; <br>  do all you can to get rid of it -- even though this contradicts <br>  my advice uptop. GWA conflicts with YouTube. Clicking on<br>  "Don't Accelerate This Website" won't help you whatsoever. <br>  (Some downloaders and converters also ruin YouTube too.)<br>  <br>  Note 2: longer videos only require "Flash" and "Shockwave"<br>  in order to play smooth. You don't need anything else.<br>  <br>  Note 3: a very odd fix that once worked for me was altering<br>  the URL from "www.youtube.com" to simply "youtube.com"<br>  (or you could even try "ca.youtube.com").<br>  <br>  Note 4: if you think that "Flash" might be the problem, you<br>  should perhaps consider 9.45 or 9.47. I have never strayed <br>  away from 9.47, and lots of "flashers" swear by 9.45.

If you don't know how to do this, visit <a href="http://portforward.com" rel="nofollow">http://portforward.com</a> and find your router and firewall on the list. <br>  <br>  5) It doesn't really matter which port you choose as long as it's not already used by some other program or a reserved port (in other words, don't use 6881-6999). You can, technically, use port 80 if you want, but this can mess your router up badly and should only be used when you absolutely cannot avoid it (if you're a China Netcom user, for instance).<br>  <br>  6) Wait for the download to finish. Note that `seeds` are clients with a complete copy of the file. `Leechers` are people who are currently downloading the file. If there are zero seeds, it will be difficult to download the file unless there happens to be one complete copy distributed amongst several leechers (eg. one guy has 20% of the file and another guy has the 80% that he lacks). <br>  <br>  Keep seeding for as long as you possibly can after you complete the download. By `seeding`, I just mean that you should not stop uploading. uTorrent will seed automatically until you tell it to stop.|`|RjF3BVzhaa	here is the guide link<br>  <a href="http://www.utorrent.com/guides.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.utorrent.com/guides.php</a>

r59SRbKIaa	When you request a web page, that's one "hit" - for the page.<br>  <br>  That page has linked images. Each image the page requests is a "hit." Most pages will also have other files - css, javascript, flash - each of these is a request associated with a "hit."<br>  <br>  So as you - the unique visitor - visit ONE PAGE it can generate hundreds of "hits," especially if you visit several pages.<br>  <br>  So when reading stats, always always always look at the "unique visits", this is the only real indicator of site traffic. 20,000 hits today? Who cares. You only had 20 unique visitors.<br>  <br>  Then you look at the source of the visitor. An isp name (qwest, rr.com, aol, etc.) will most likely be a real visitor. Visits from googlebot, slurp (yahoo,) msn - these are all search engine spiders visiting your site, indexing content, and are not real "visitors."<br>  <br>  Although this is good, because it's indexing your content in the search engines, you subtract the spider visits from your 20 uniques and you find you only have 5 or 10 REAL visitors . . . it's time to do something about your site. This is what I do. :-)|`|ebuxHnScaa	They measure different things. The "visitors" measure tells you how many people visit your site each day. The "hits" measure tells you how many files the web server served for your page each day.<br>  <br>  The "visitors" count is the most important measure of popularity. If 20 people visit your site each day, that's a much less popular site than one that 1,000 people visit each day.<br>  <br>  If you divide the "visitors" by the "hits", that will give you an idea of about how much content each visitor to your site gets. A low number indicates that most people just look at the first page and then go elsewhere. A high number indicates that people are really enjoying your site and following your links from page to page.

b301fdd2f7f0f686b01337263980d14baa	Good show !<br>  <br>  Most people who buy branded PCs do so because they lack the knowledge or confidence to build one themselves or lack all the software that some brands include (especially Windows).<br>  <br>  HP & Dell (for example) sell via brand name recognition more than actual product substance. Novices feel secure with the warranty & after sales support they offer.<br>  <br>  Building one yourself is not only a cost saver (especially for higher end units) but also gives you a feeling of great satisfaction.<br>  <br>  regards,<br>  Philip T|`|g7M1DxFCaa	Modern PC's are a lot like Lego these days, you can't really break anything when you build them, you don't need your soldering iron either.  Then as we all know, the hardware is the easy part, getting all the software installed is the main part of the job.  I suppose that people prefer to buy a ready made product with the comfort of product support than to attempt a build.  If everyone did build and maintain their own machines then the PC industry would lose a lot of work.  It's good that those of us with knowledge can earn a living with what we know.  Not everyone wants to specialise though, they just want something that works.|`|7cUDstdjaa	Why don't you start a little business?|`|AA11703028	hi dominic<br>             correct mate,its takes time but sooner or later most of us relalise its far cheaper to build a pc ourselves than pay these companys a extra ￡1000 for the privelage of building it for us !<br>             and allthough the thought of building a pc can scare some people its not that difficult as you have discovered and it only gets better after the first build and the next will be easier<br>             personally the best part of pc building is looking for bargain components and seeing how much you can save,for example i have managed a basic base unit for less than ￡95,this was using the most basic components and even a budget graphics card<br>             also you should check out computer fairs and boot sales for knock down hardware,i recently bought a geforce 7800gtx for ￡10 from a boot sale,and when you consider they were in excess of ￡300 only two years ago this was a massive bargain<br>              and finally since you have the experience of building pc,s well start to repair them aswell,you can repair freinds computers for half the price of the shops,they save money and you gain experience...everyones a winner !<br>             well done and good luck mate !|`|32dffe7e0eba9eb2c4e6c9418ec99ba5aa	It's a personal choice.  You can probably build your own car or television set, too, but would you?<br>  <br>  Building it yourself ensures that you get exactly what you want for your money, no more and no less, but it also means that you have no warranty or technical support, and if you break something, you're out of luck.

c3f053e32d1e7ff0710bea42cb07d322aa	Mine's probably average, so you don't necessarily need to see it: I did it myself. Domain name registration: $8 per year (cost of a paperback book!) Domain hosting, $145 for 3-year commitment. Cheap, and a good company. <br>  <br>  I bought Photoshop ($700 or so) for graphics, and BBedit ($125) for code building. You could buy, or get free, different software for the same stuff (GIMP for graphics is free and Notepad++ for code-building is free, for two examples).<br>  <br>  I bought a dozen or so reference books at a fair price so I don't have to go online to look stuff up all the time: does that count as an expense? How about the laptop itself. My time? <br>  <br>  I charge $45 per hour. Consulting after the first hit is chargeable: I learned that, after the first job, where the client spent more time "consulting" than I spent "doing". I also go for a one-hour minimum, for those cases in which clients keep calling up for a "oh, this'll only take you five minutes" shot.<br>  <br>  I know that many pros use CS4, which includes Photoshop and also Dreamweaver (automated website creator and Flash and all the slick things...and quite a bit of learning involved, of course). But that booger is expensive, and of course, the cost would have to be passed on and parceled out, no?|`|Yt2bCYyWaa	check out 1&1 (<a href="http://www.1and1.com/?k_id=17378169)," rel="nofollow">http://www.1and1.com/?k_id=17378169),</a> they can help you with domain registration, site creations shopping cart, etc.  very simple to set up a site with them.<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|1xivkqkfaa	I did mine myself.

This will show prospective employers that you're serious about programming, and that you have the ability and knowledge.|`|1xivkqkfaa	If you love computer programming then you will do it for fun and leverage that experience into a lucrative career.   If you do not love computer programming, you will never be good at it and should try a less demanding profession.

WQ0DzpByaa	Here's the procedure for firefox portable. It works.<br>   If you're using a local copy of Firefox, you may wish to just copy your local Firefox settings right into Firefox Portable. Your local Firefox profile is usually installed in C:\Documents and Settings\[user]\Application Data\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\default.??... After running Firefox Portable once to let it setup its data directories, just copy the contents of that folder (except the cache directories) to the FirefoxPortable\Data\profile directory. Then, and this is important, delete the file FirefoxPortableSettings.ini within the FirefoxPortable\Data\settings directory, if there is one. When you start Firefox Portable for the first time, it's recommended that you turn off disk cache, password saving and history if you're using a flash-based portable device. You can set all of these within the Privacy tab of the Firefox Options window. Sometimes, certain profiles will cause the launcher to fail or hang. It's best to give it a few minutes to see if it's just checking compatiblity and adjusting the locations of the extensions before giving up on it. If it fails, it is usually due to an incompatible extension.|`|BBnnSwK9aa	I use a neat AND free Utility called MozBackup, from:<br>  <br>  It back up everything, not just Bookmarks, and works like a charm!|`|6jJGgsLpaa	Download the app for Firefox called "Foxmarks" on your old computer, and then install it on the other one as well.

In the example above, amateria is repeating something from kfoxaz about a new music service.<br>  <br>  This is only useful if you have followers that the original person doesn’t have - meaning, if you’ve only got a couple of followers, you probably shouldn’t bother with ReTweets.<br>  <br>  This is slang, not a system function.

zorYTX59aa	There are a few things you should be aware of when you<br>  label your videos: "tags" are only the 3rd most important <br>  element in YouTube's search-results. Words in the titles <br>  are 1st, and words in the descriptions are 2nd.<br>  <br>  And way in front of those three different variables is your <br>  YouTube username. Thus, tags are actually in 4th place,<br>  and as such are the least important element in a search.<br>  <br>  (Whenever you do a search, how often do you get videos <br>  at the top of those results with no matching words in the <br>  username, video titles, or descriptions? Just about never.  <br>  If you ever do get results like that with no matches at all,<br>  those are the times when 'tags' are relevant in a search.)<br>  <br>  Thus if you would like your videos to appear near the top <br>  of search results, the ideal would be to have people type <br>  in your username first followed by the title of one of your <br>  videos -- if not some of the most unique words.|`|SfuVoSKfaa	Only put tags that deals with your video.<br>  <br>  If your video suppose to be about comedy, put; Funny, Hilarious, etc. Stuff like that.

vUsVieulaa	As strange as it sounds, Dreamweaver makes web design MUCH harder than it really is. Heck, any WYSIWYG editor adds an unnecessary layer of complexity.<br>  <br>  Learn to code by hand. It will take some time and some patience, but will be very rewarding in the end. So switch to code view in Dreamweaver and don't go into design view except to edit textual content.<br>  <br>  You don't need to add any DIV tags per se. All you need to do to attach a CSS selector to an element is:<br>  <h1 class="myselector">Text Here</h1><br>  <h1 id="myselector">Text Here</h1><br>  <br>  DIV tags are designed primarily for layout. You don't NEED to put an <h1> into a <div> all by its lonesome.|`|8BlsO3ncaa	You can apply CSS to any element. So, for example, you could have <h1 style="color:red"> to make the heading text red.

PfXHhp3Haa	COOL car crash you have on there
zorYTX59aa	Several times each day, YouTube shuts down a few of their <br>  servers to update stuff. Be patient if YouTube is slow, stuck<br>  or mangled. Transmissions from YouTube to your computer<br>  are done in multiple tiny packets of data and flash at a time. <br>  That's why sometimes you may get any of these scenarios: <br>  bits and pieces of text/thumbnails in weird places; sluggish<br>  loading/buffering; the spinning circle going on forever; or the<br>  player being blank. This problem could fix itself within a few <br>  hours or by the next day.<br>  <br>  If your YouTube continues to behave slow, stuck or strange,<br>  it's very possible that your directories of "temporary internet <br>  files" and RAM (sometimes known as "cache") are close to<br>  the maximum and just cannot take anymore, the end result <br>  being any of the above scenarios or videos that: A) come to <br>  a complete freeze; B) start/stop/start/stop in a choppy way; <br>  or C) never even make it onto your screen.<br>  <br>  "Temporary internet files" are tiny bits of webpages that get <br>  permanently put on your hard-drive. They will remain forever<br>  on your computer, gradually plugging it up like hair stuck in <br>  a sink drain, until you finally get rid of them once and for all. <br>  Thus, exit out of YouTube, then clear your "cache" of all its<br>  "temporary internet files", "cookies" and "history". It is best<br>  if you shutdown and reboot afterwards. You'll be amazed at <br>  how "fresh" and "new" your YouTube will be.<br>  <br>  Note 1: if you have got Google Web Accelerator or software<br>  similar to it....dump it, burn it, trash it, disable it, uninstall it; <br>  -- do everything you can to get rid of it. Not only does GWA<br>  totally conflict with and destroy YouTube, clicking on "Don't<br>  Accelerate This Website" won't help you whatsoever.<br>  <br>  Note 2: longer-running videos require both "Shockwave" and<br>  "Flash" to play smoothly. You don't need anything else.<br>  <br>  Note 3: a strange fix that once worked for me was changing<br>  the website URL from "www.youtube.com" to "youtube.com"<br>  (or you could even try "ca.youtube.com").<br>  <br>  Note 4: depending on the way your account was first set up, <br>  your "video playblack quality" might be telling YouTube that <br>  your internet connection speed is set to either "dynamic" or <br>  "fast" -- which makes YouTube play videos at higher quality. <br>  This in turn eats up a lot of bandwidth, memory and "cache". <br>  If you are "signed-in" on YouTube as you are looking at this<br>  answer, you can actually check your "VPQ" from right here <br>  within Yahoo!Answers by clicking my link just below, which <br>  will take you right to "YOUR VERY OWN" playback setting:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/account#playback/quality" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/account#playback/...</a><br>  Otherwise after you "sign-in", click the 4th black option that<br>  will be on the left side, called "Playback Setup".<br>  <br>  Note 5: nothing about playing YouTube videos has changed <br>  in the past 2 years. If anything, the newer Flash players are <br>  causing many YouTubers a whole lot of grief, especially the<br>  5 versions of Flash 10. It is absolutely farcical that there's a<br>  10.0.525, 10.1.218, 10.2.26, 10.2.54 and 10.12.36. Updates <br>  are typically good for one thing: software/computer conflicts.<br>  I've never strayed away from 9.47, and many flashers swear<br>  by 9.45. Think of them as XP compared to Vista.

There’s a decent guide covering this that you can work through at My Slow PC (<a href="http://www.MySlowPC.co.uk/)" rel="nofollow">http://www.MySlowPC.co.uk/)</a> – click on the “Troubleshooting” link.  Here’s my advice from it:<br>  <br>  1.) Turn System Restore OFF so any infection that you remove is not restored.<br>  <br>  2.) Scan with a combination of the best detection utilities as you’ll find different scanners can sometimes pick up different infections.  E.g.<br>  <br>     * McAfee Stinger – a free stand-alone utility used to detect and remove specific viruses.<br>     * SpyBot Search & Destroy – a spyware/adware scanner<br>     * Lavasoft Adaware – for spyware/adware<br>  <br>  Note – it might be a good idea to disconnect your network connection once you’ve updated them with the latest virus/spyware definitions.  This is due to the fact that often an infection is trying to spread over your network.<br>  <br>  3.) If the above fails or you’re not sure if you’re still infected, when you start your PC tap the F8 key, select “Safe Mode” and repeat the scans once you’re connected.<br>  <br>  I hope the above helps, as mentioned the guide above is a lot more detailed and the My Slow PC site is pretty useful.  Good luck!|`|uuDloQnCaa	Download, install, update and scan your computer with both Malwarebytes and SuperantiSpyware, delete anything they find, if this fails to completely remove the virus/spyware download then update Avast and run a boot scan (click schedule boot-time scan and restart your PC), all the software below is free and safe to use.<br>  <br>  Malwarebytes: <a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php</a><br>  <br>  SuperantiSpyware: <a href="http://www.superantispyware.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.superantispyware.com/</a><br>  <br>  Avast Anti-Virus: <a href="http://www.avast.com/eng/avast_4_home.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.avast.com/eng/avast_4_home.ht...</a><br>  <br>  To protect your PC in the future you'll need to install anti-virus software and a firewall, id recommend using Avast and Comodo Pro firewall both are very effective and completely free, you should also switch to Firefox 3 if you are browsing with IE as its much safer and a lot easier to use.

k5KuYkkKaa	No, in your multi-core processor, each core processes a stream of data (thread) at 3.0GHz. Two cores, two threads at 3.0GHz. If you had a quad core running at 3.0GHz, it would have four cores processing four threads at 3.0GHZ. The more cores you have, the more data you can process at 3.0GHz. Having two cores doesn't mean it runs twice as fast, it means it can process twice as much data at 3.0GHZ as a single core processor running at the same speed. <br>  There is an exception, the Intel Core i7 processors are quad core, but are able to process 2 threads per core, making it seem as if it has 8 cores when in fact it only has 4.|`|XlyLakYAaa	No.  You cannot multiply it out like that.  It doesn't work that way.<br>  <br>  The reason being is that code can only operate on a single core at a time.  There are some multi-threaded programs that can take full advantage of both cores, but even then you're just increasing throughput, not increasing clock-speed.<br>  <br>  You can use the analogy of a highway.  Faster clock-speed means a higher speed limit.  More cores means more lanes.  If there's just one car on the road, it won't get there any faster no matter how many extra lanes there are, but if there's a lot of traffic, extra lanes help a lot more than a higher speed limit.|`|lT8yExI1aa	Yes, if that is a dual-core processor you will be running a 6.0GHz computer which is fast. I don't think you can only run 1 processor anyway - you should already be running at 6.0GHz.
khswD4Giaa	If he really knew what he was talking about (his presence here indicates he doesn't) then he would know that SINGLE core processors aren't necessarily automatically worse than multicore. A nice expensive feature packed single core back in the day, which may be cheap now, is better than your average dual core. This is because the more expensive CPUs have more expensive logic circuits inside, which can do more calculations per cycle (with this your CPU will achieve better performance than some higher clocking CPUs because of efficiency).<br>  <br>  Also, multicore has come a long way, but they're not standard software wise just yet. If software can't take advantage of your multicore, then you might as well have bought a single core. It depends on what you do with your computer.<br>  <br>  Note that linux is probably the best OS to use with multicore. XP wasn't created around multi cores, and vista just sucks too much to be of any help. I have not tried linux myself.<br>  <br>  So in short the answer to your question is; yes Athlon XP is a very good series. I am very fond of my now seemingly outdated 2.2Ghz Athlon XP 3700+ which performs better in benchmarking than my friend's intel 1.7Ghz dual core.|`|QYPrM3GPaa	Monocore processor?

RcFLl8Fiaa	go to windows update site and update your system.<br>  <br>  also you might have had some sites blocked by your mom or dad or older brother or sister that don't think the sites are where you should be, or because they are bad sites.<br>  <br>  but updating should fix it if there is a problem with the browser.<br>  <br>  also you are more likely out of ram and that is why you have trouble with the video watching.    every thing you do on the computer takes ram.  and the more you have open the more ram is used if there is not enough then you either did not close something or something is timed to run in the background and that will take up ram with out you knowing it.  or you just didn't turn off some stuff

QdTd6Preaa	Yes once you have downloaded the torrent.  You automatically become a seeder.  You will continue to seed until you stop or, remove the torrent.  Generally speaking the more seeders and, fewer leechers the faster the download.|`|KrTKYBXvaa	Torrents are P2P (Peer to Peer). Somone makes a torrent file and allow others to download it. Whoever got that torrent file assigned to a file in the first place is the first seeder. While u download it u are allowing others to download the data you've already downloaded. Also if the file is within your download folder for the torrent application you are still seeding them files. If noone seeds, there will be no leachers.|`|FqrKjtzwaa	I think you can be a seeder even if you haven't totally downloaded the file yet - as long as you have parts of it already, you will seed those parts to others (the leechers).

Even php used for dynamic pages is only a powerful scripting language.|`|FqrKjtzwaa	Game programming is a lot more complicated, mainly because HTML is just arranging information for static display, whereas with a game you have to keep track of things constantly changing, have data structures, etc.<br>  <br>  Certainly knowing HTML will help a little, but only a little.|`|kWxhWET7aa	You aren't ready for game programming.

75nbESJUaa	To make the visual "stutter" is usually called "stop-motion". Several stop-motion plug-ins available. I've seen great visual on youtube using a cheap, and I mean cheap-butt digital camera (single shot). I've seen really funny stuff of dudes sitting on the ground and act like they are driving a car.<br>  <br>  Hardware: you need a cable to connect your handycam to your computer and then capture the DVraw. From there, I like Linux because all the software is free (as in "free beer"). One industrial-strength software is called Cinelerra. goto www.metacafe.com and search for 'cinelerra' (also on youtube). <br>  <br>  3D programs such as blender.org has a video editor. Another one I like is Kdenlive. With Linux, it takes a combination of several tools.<br>  <br>  Time is your enemy. It takes forever and a day to render DVraw into edited video. The only speed comes from doing it right the first time. That's when I really appreciate AMD-64 single-core, 3400 mgHz with SATA-cable hard drives, 4-gig memory. However, I have NEVER topped out 2-Gig RAM. The CPU, on the other hand can really heat up and System Monitor shows 90-97% usage typically.

be55f04b8c79c46e08a6dcc1d71b8bd5aa	Actually, doing the "killall dock" command in Terminal will only cause the Dock to quit and reopen; it won't change its contents. What you can do, however, is replace its preference file with a factory-fresh one. (Now, I'm working from Leopard, but I don't believe things have changed all that much in terms of what you'd need to do here.)<br>  <br>  If you can, open up System Preferences and create a new user account.  Log into that new account, and find its user preferences folder (i.e. /Users/newuser/Library/Preferences/). In there should be a file called com.apple.dock.plist, which contains not only the Dock's settings (i.e. whether hiding and magnification are turned on or off, which side of the screen to show up on), but also which icons should be present on it.<br>  <br>  Because of security restrictions in OS X, you can't just drop files into another user's Library folder, so copy the new user's dock .plist into your own drop box (i.e. /Users/cookie/Public/Drop Box/). Then log into your own user account again, replace your own com.apple.dock.plist with the one from the drop box, and *then* open up Terminal and type "killall dock" (without the quotes) to give it a kickstart with the new .plist. Hopefully, that will reset your Dock to its default set of icons, and you can put your favourite apps back where they were on it before. Hope that helps!<br>  <br>  P.S. If your machine is so slowed down that you aren't even able to make a new user account, try bumming a com.apple.dock.plist off someone else who has a Mac. :) It may have icons that point to nonexistent apps, but you can just drag those off.|`|AA11976863	Go to "Go" in the Finder top menu bar, click "Home". Navigate to Library /Preferences. Delete com.apple.dock.plist<br>  Logout, login (or restart).<br>  <br>  Any preference file will always reappear, in a default configuration, as soon as the associated application opens. The Dock loads soon after the desktop appears and that's when the preference file will be recreated. If you have moved any of the default listed applications that were in the Dock originally, the icon will be replaced by a "?" to show that the Dock can't find that item. To correct this, drag the "?" off the Dock, and drag the "missing in action" application to the Dock to make a new icon.

scLagxRwaa	You are correct in believing that NAT is denying outside access. Effectively, what's going on is you've got several computers behind a router all getting one IP address (think of this as a company having one phone number, but multiple extensions) and because you aren't telling your router, "Hey, I have something I need to serve on port 2350!" it's denying access. TrackMania has a wiki at <a href="http://en.tm-wiki.org/wiki/Server_Setup" rel="nofollow">http://en.tm-wiki.org/wiki/Server_Setup</a> on how to setup the server, and <a href="http://www.portforward.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.portforward.com/</a> can tell you how to set up port forwarding so that others can connect.

jLe6GDu8aa	I will give you the options I give to everyone else on here who wants to get into game programming.<br>  <br>  The very best alternative for anyone new to programming is to learn Visual Basic. If you learn Visual Basic, you will eventually be able to make decent games. The only problem is, an FPS game on Visual Basic is nearly impossible to do because it does not support Direct X or utilize any special features on a PC to run a game.<br>  First off, lets get the one you will less likely want to learn out of the way. If you've ever played any games made by steam (Counter Strike, Half Life 2, Left 4 Dead), you have the source engine. The source engine is what powers all those games and is at full disposal for you to make your own games or "mods" for it. There is little tutorials, books, and help in this area, though, which makes it difficult to get into. The engine itself is written in C++ and their website list what editors are good. Read this for more on the source engine:<br>  <a href="http://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/..." rel="nofollow">http://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/...</a><br>  <br>  But I think the source engine is way out of your league, especially if your new to programming. If you are new to programming, I highly recommend you learn to use XNA.<br>  <br>  XNA is a framework developed for Microsoft Visual Studio C# Express Edition that allows you to make, debug, and publish games for the PC and Xbox 360. The best part about it is, everything is 100% free if you want to try out making PC games (only if you want to test your games on 360 does it cost anything). If you want to make 360 games, you can still get the software and make and test the games out on the PC for free.<br>  Now for the breakdown of what XNA is. As I said before, it is a framework written in C#. XNA allows you to make full blown 2D and 3D games from scratch anyway you want. The best part about XNA and the reason why I say you should learn it is for one, there is plenty of material that exist to help you learn to make games. On the official website, there are tutorials, videos, and a large community of other users on there that can help you when you get stuck to start making games. In addition, you make games from complete scratch anyway you want where as using the Source Engine, you are limited to making 3D FPS games, and 3D games are very hard to get a grasp on when you are new to games.<br>  <br>  The official website for XNA is located here:<br>  <a href="http://creators.xna.com/en-US/" rel="nofollow">http://creators.xna.com/en-US/</a><br>  <br>  All you need to do to get started with XNA is use to first, download Visual Studio C# 2008 Express Edition, then Google the download for the XNA framework and install it. It takes a good hour to install everything, so make sure you have the time.<br>  I highly recommend you try out XNA. You may think the idea of making games is very fun but it is actually extremely difficult, and you have to be very good at math to understand how to calculate movement in games. Your only in 8th grade, I don't know how much geometry you learned yet but your definitely going to need to learn that whether you make 2D or 3D games. I also recommend that you stick to 2D games for now. 3D games are very confusing involving alot of math that is difficult for me, and I am taking up programming in college!<br>  <br>  Programming is going to be very difficult for you if your new to programming and never learned it before. Learning C++ or C# is alot to handle. If you get extremely confused trying out XNA, perhaps you should try learning to make simple programs in Visual Basic and learning some simple programming concepts and terminology. There are other alternatives to making games as well, but right now the most popular program at colleges is XNA and the Source Engine. Good luck in your game development! Stick to it throughout high school, and you will have a huge head start on everyone out there if you choose to go to college for it. But explore other opportunities out there, sitting behind a PC all day isn't the most glorious job, either!|`|fTOM0aUfaa	Try Dark Basic Professional, it has many features to making a great game.

But the one I like the VERY best is <a href="http://www.delicious.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.delicious.com</a> (owned by our good ol' buddies at Yahoo! incidentally).<br>  <br>  Main advantage of course is that you can get at yer bookmarks from any computer anywhere in the world no matter what.<br>  <br>  Another really handy advantage (Google can't do this) is that you can search on MULTIPLE keywords. See, you categorize your bookmarks by keywords. Some of mine are "tools" and "tips" and "reference" and "forums" and "css". (You might guess I'm a webmaster.) So, if I want a "css reference" then I can search ALL the "css" bookmarks then narrow it down to the ones I've tagged as "reference".<br>  <br>  Also, you can look up what everyone else on delicious has bookmarked for "css". Handy. Google doesn't do that, either.

There’s a decent guide covering this that you can work through at My Slow PC (<a href="http://www.MySlowPC.co.uk/)" rel="nofollow">http://www.MySlowPC.co.uk/)</a> – click on the “Troubleshooting” link.  Here’s my advice from it:<br>  <br>  1.) Turn System Restore OFF so any infection that you remove is not restored.<br>  <br>  2.) Scan with a combination of the best detection utilities as you’ll find different scanners can sometimes pick up different infections.  E.g.<br>  <br>     * McAfee Stinger – a free stand-alone utility used to detect and remove specific viruses.<br>     * SpyBot Search & Destroy – a spyware/adware scanner<br>     * Lavasoft Adaware – for spyware/adware<br>  <br>  Note – it might be a good idea to disconnect your network connection once you’ve updated them with the latest virus/spyware definitions.  This is due to the fact that often an infection is trying to spread over your network.<br>  <br>  3.) If the above fails or you’re not sure if you’re still infected, when you start your PC tap the F8 key, select “Safe Mode” and repeat the scans once you’re connected.<br>  <br>  I hope the above helps, as mentioned the guide above is a lot more detailed and the My Slow PC site is pretty useful.

There’s a decent guide covering this that you can work through at My Slow PC (<a href="http://www.MySlowPC.co.uk/)" rel="nofollow">http://www.MySlowPC.co.uk/)</a> – click on the “Troubleshooting” link.  Here’s my advice from it:<br>  <br>  1.) Turn System Restore OFF so any infection that you remove is not restored.<br>  <br>  2.) Scan with a combination of the best detection utilities as you’ll find different scanners can sometimes pick up different infections.  E.g.<br>  <br>     * McAfee Stinger – a free stand-alone utility used to detect and remove specific viruses.<br>     * SpyBot Search & Destroy – a spyware/adware scanner<br>     * Lavasoft Adaware – for spyware/adware<br>  <br>  Note – it might be a good idea to disconnect your network connection once you’ve updated them with the latest virus/spyware definitions.  This is due to the fact that often an infection is trying to spread over your network.<br>  <br>  3.) If the above fails or you’re not sure if you’re still infected, when you start your PC tap the F8 key, select “Safe Mode” and repeat the scans once you’re connected.<br>  <br>  I hope the above helps, as mentioned the guide above is a lot more detailed and the My Slow PC site is pretty useful.  Good luck!

t5sYXwSqaa	The component could be the battery or a capacitor as it is obviously polarity sensitive, however it is now unusual to solder a battery into the board as they normally need replacing after 4 or 5 years. AS you say you have taken the battery out then I suspect a capacitor. This may be there to just hold your bois settings whilst you replace the battery. Have you tried resetting your bios. There is normally a 3 pin jumper and you would take the two pin jumper and put it from pins 1 and 2 to pins 2 and 3. You need to leave it like this (WITHOUT POWER) for about 10 minutes (enough time to drain the capacitor). After this period replace the jumper back to pins 1 and 2 and then test.<br>  <br>  Incidentally is there anything you have done prior to this that may have had an effect. Is there any message on the screen that may give an indication. Can you get into bios (normally pressing F2 or ESC whilst computer is starting.  Is there any indication of power eg led light on MOBO, HHD starting, Fan starting etc. Please let me know and I will try to help you further.<br>  <br>  If you have reset the bios to no effect then take out your hard disc drive and put your OS disc in the DVD drive. Restart the computer. Will it boot from this disk. If it will not you have either fried your bios and that will require a new chip or the southbridge chip controller has gone faulty. Either way its bad news. I personally would think it is the Bios chip as you do not appear to be able to boot from it. Make sure you have tried to reset the Bios as this might just do the trick. Keep me posted.
L1cBV8qQaa	I hate how people always say that everything is a virus.  Now just to be sure, run a scan, or download Norton 360  as a trial...<br>  <br>  If as I suspect and nothing is found, you have one solution, uninstall the games and reinstall them.  <br>  <br>  How many plugs are in the same plug as your computer?  Your tower should always be plugged into it's own outlet, while the printer, monitor, ect is on the splitter.<br>  <br>  How much RAM you got?

To compensate for this, the pc normally increases the speed of the cooler fan. if the fan is not performing properly (can be due to several reasons like old age, small size, poor quality, etc) the PC (mainly the processor) heats up and a safety protocol is triggered to reset the PC in order to prevent hardware damage.<br>  <br>  To solve your problem, you should buy a new (better) cooling fan.|`|AA11587827	my pc was doing about the same, it woud change web pages on its own, very slow, and yahoo messenger would shut down for no reason, i had avast,avg and another anti virus scan it and it always came up clean, then i downloaded Avira, and ran it, i had like 23 infected files that the other anti virurs  missed, its fine now and i have had no problems, Avira is free if u look it up as a free download, its a great system|`|nAcGpTXnaa	What virus software do you have?

XT8rCpRbaa	Try testing the power supply with a voltmeter. Also check if you seated the RAM modules properly (correct orientation if you have a REALLY REALLY CHEAP mother board and/or if its seated all the way) Doesn't seem like your getting beep codes I would assume the the motherboard is damaged. see if you can swap it out for another. could use a little more information.

If that doesn't work, take back the Modem, and get a new one. It's much faster than waiting for a tech from your ISP. Call them first though, and have them check the line. They can do that while your on the phone. Plus you should get a different provider. My download speed ranges from 16 to 33 thousand kb/s, depending how many people are online.

vhlIB9mHaa	Alright, I have checked your code and I think I have just the solution for you. <br>  <br>  First of all, in your loop, you should check for line break, that is char '\n'. Next thing to fix is that when you check for space, you have to add another "="-sign, as you have it now it will just set iochar. <br>  <br>  I do not know about you, but I had to flush the output stream to show the text before entering the loop. <br>  <br>  Ok, to sum it up, this is your program edited:<br>  <br>  <br>  #include <stdio.h><br>  <br>  int main()<br>  {<br>   int iochar, numdigits = 0, numlower = 0, numupper = 0, numwhites = 0;<br>  <br>   printf("Please enter a phrase:\n");<br>   fflush(stdout); // To show the user what to do<br>   while ((iochar = getchar()) != '\n')<br>   {<br>    if (iochar == ' ')<br>    {<br>     numwhites++;<br>     putchar(iochar);<br>    }<br>    else if ((iochar >= '0') && (iochar <= '9'))<br>    {<br>     numdigits++;<br>     putchar(iochar);<br>    }<br>    else if (('a' <= iochar) && (iochar <= 'z'))<br>    {<br>     numlower++;<br>     putchar(iochar - 32);<br>    }<br>    else if (('A' <= iochar) && (iochar <= 'Z'))<br>    {<br>     numupper++;<br>     putchar(iochar);<br>    }<br>    else<br>     putchar(iochar);<br>   }<br>  <br>   printf("%d white characters, %d digits, ", numwhites, numdigits);<br>   printf("%d lowercase have been converted to ", numlower);<br>   printf("uppercase and %d uppercase.\n", numupper);<br>   printf("\n\n");<br>  <br>   return 0;<br>  }<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope that is what you needed :)|`|97ca6663adad94c1f5fa4d010bf0ce51aa	i didnt bther to compile or run this , one thing that doesnt seem ok to me is that white space can also be \t \n etc.<br>  ity looks ok to me, do you get compile errors ? can you give an . output that deviates from the expected ?|`|kWxhWET7aa	Well, just by looking over it once I see that you're checking for EOF in your while loop, but you're not addressing a file source but an input string from the console. You should check for end of line instead:<br>  <br>  while( ( iochar=getchar() ) != "\n" )<br>  {<br>  <br>  // --- do your while loop stuff here --- //<br>  <br>  }<br>  <br>  There might be other issues as well, but at least I help you with one bug.|`|m83f66pvaa	hai,<br>  friend i go through ur program.your logic is good but u didnt write what was the error.<br>  first of all u have to open iostream.h<br>  #include<iostream.h><br>  iochar is int data type. change that to char.<br>  so putchar() cannot use a int value.<br>  k.<br>  bye..<br>  ....<br>  abey|`|AkTX2O3uaa	I'm not sure but i think that in place of numwhites++;, numdigits++ and others like that, you have to write ++numwhites.<br>  Hope that helps a bit..

HYedOEbnaa	yep she can just join your network.  Just put that computer into the same workgroup as everything else and you will be able to print.  Also make sure that printer sharing is turned on|`|YiY9Yd2Jaa	You will need to ensure that the relative printer drivers are on your Mom's new laptop and that it is set up as a part of the same workgroup and it should be able to find and install the printer. As your existing printer is a wirelsss printer, it will have its own IP address that the new laptop can access - you don't need to turn printer sharing on unless the printer is actually physically connected to your computer. Unnecessarily turning printer sharing on increases the vulnerability of computers to attack.

Here is another way you could do it without an array formula.<br>  <br>  =SMALL(A1:A9,COUNTIF(A1:A9,0)+1)<br>  <br>  The COUNTIF function counts the number of zeros in A1:A9 and one is added to that count. SMALL finds the nth smallest value in A1:A9 which is the zero count plus one.

kWxhWET7aa	You haven't defined, nor are you using the array correctly.<br>  <br>  To define an array in ANY form of BASIC you need the parenthesis, for example:<br>  <br>  Dim Intresult() as Integer<br>  <br>  Then when you access the array, you must index into it. You do this by specifying a location<br>  <br>  Intresult( 1 )<br>  Intresult( 2 )<br>  Intresult( and so on )<br>  <br>  But don't use this form. Because this is a VBScript form of a dynamic array which requires manipulation routines (I don't have time to explain). Instead, declare the array as a predefined size, unless you need it to shrink and grow on demand. To set a predefined size, just do it like this when you declare the array:<br>  <br>  Dim Intresult( 10 ) as Integer<br>  <br>  That should help a little, if not completely solve the problem.

jzex4ncSaa	Some thoughts about programming languages..<br>  <br>  First and foremost, do not fall into the trap of thinking that newer is necessarily better. In fact, the trendiest languages like Java, C#, VB.Net (or anything related to the .Net framework) are about 'restricting' what you, the programmer, is 'allowed' to do. Working in any language that 'confines' you to a 'sandbox' and 'prevents' you from manipulating pointers and 'forces' you to use a class library written by somebody else in order to get any real work done, well, it's worse than useless.<br>  <br>  Training wheels on bicycles serve a legitimate purpose, but what if they could not be removed? How much serious competitive riding could you do then? Would you buy a bicycle with unremovable training wheels? Well, the same goes for Java, C# and similar languages. Sadly, the majority of recently-trained programmers have been taught to love the chains that bind them.<br>  <br>  For instance, managed code in the .Net framework doesn't even compile down to real machine code! It ends up as "byte code" that is interpreted, not executed. Why? Well, to keep you in the sandbox, of course! To prevent you from hurting yourself with those nasty, dangerous, sharp pointers! You paid for the computer, and the compiler, but Microsoft controls what you can do with them. Not only that, but the religious dogma that goes with the territory requires you to believe that this is a good thing!<br>  <br>  Anyway, if you can program in C, I say stick with it, and add some of the "++" features if and when you need them. But be frugal about it. Some of the features in C++ are nice -- classes, templates, namespaces and dynamic casts have their uses -- but they are very easy to abuse, too. In many cases, I find that less is more when it comes to such features. Often the syntactic sugar gets in the way of writing code that is truly lean and mean. As well, generality requires the "++" features to be implemented rather inefficiently, no matter how much doubletalk the compiler brochures throw at you. They also tell you that a good optimizing compiler can generate better code than you can by hand-coding in assembly language. Don't believe it for a second! I've never seen a compiler that could even get within a factor of three of somebody's assembly code, on any platform, and many have tried!<br>  <br>  One more thing: don't believe them when they say you need the "++" features to support object-oriented programming. Object-oriented programming is a state of mind, a design approach, a set of coding conventions, that need not be supported by any special syntactic constructs whatsoever. Someone has written object-oriented, event-driven programs in assembly language.<br>  <br>  And lastly, don't believe them when they say you need MFC, or any other class library, to write windows applications. The truth is, everything you need is available in the form of operating system calls. No sub-classing, super-classing, or wrapper functions required. someone has written entire windows applications in assembly language, complete with GUI. They're much smaller - as in, 10's of kilobytes, instead of 10's of megabytes - and much more transparent, and therefore much easier to debug.<br>  <br>  Okay, having said all that, if you want to write toy programs with pretty GUIs, that run like molasses in January but can be thrown together overnight, then pick VB (but not later than VB6).<br>  <br>  For real programming, work in C/C++.<br>  <br>  <br>  Tutorials,<br>  You can try in here,<br>  + <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/</a><br>  + <a href="http://www.cprogramming.com/tutorial.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cprogramming.com/tutorial.htm...</a><br>  + <a href="http://www.functionx.com/cpp/index.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.functionx.com/cpp/index.htm</a><br>  + <a href="http://www.codersource.net/codersource_cppprogramming.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.codersource.net/codersource_c...</a><br>  + <a href="http://www.cprogramming.com/tutorial.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cprogramming.com/tutorial.htm...</a><br>  + <a href="http://www.programmersheaven.com/tags/C/" rel="nofollow">http://www.programmersheaven.com/tags/C/</a><br>  + <a href="http://www.programmingtutorials.com/cplusplus.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.programmingtutorials.com/cplu...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Regards,<br>  <br>  -de|`|c3f053e32d1e7ff0710bea42cb07d322aa	A good one to START with, is some form of Basic.

There’s a decent guide covering this that you can work through at My Slow PC (<a href="http://www.MySlowPC.co.uk/)" rel="nofollow">http://www.MySlowPC.co.uk/)</a> – click on the “Troubleshooting” link.  Here’s my advice from it:<br>  <br>  1.) Turn System Restore OFF so any infection that you remove is not restored.<br>  <br>  2.) Scan with a combination of the best detection utilities as you’ll find different scanners can sometimes pick up different infections.  E.g.<br>  <br>     * McAfee Stinger – a free stand-alone utility used to detect and remove specific viruses.<br>     * SpyBot Search & Destroy – a spyware/adware scanner<br>     * Lavasoft Adaware – for spyware/adware<br>  <br>  Note – it might be a good idea to disconnect your network connection once you’ve updated them with the latest virus/spyware definitions.  This is due to the fact that often an infection is trying to spread over your network.<br>  <br>  3.) If the above fails or you’re not sure if you’re still infected, when you start your PC tap the F8 key, select “Safe Mode” and repeat the scans once you’re connected.<br>  <br>  I hope the above helps, as mentioned the guide above is a lot more detailed and the My Slow PC site is pretty useful.

t7fsCXnvaa	Twitter is a social networking and micro-blogging service. It enables its users to send and read other users' updates (known as tweets), which are text-based posts of up to 140 characters in length. Updates are displayed on the user's profile page and delivered to other users who have signed up to receive them. Senders can restrict delivery to those in their circle of friends (delivery to everyone being the default). Users can send and receive updates via the Twitter website, SMS, RSS (receive only), or through applications such as Tweetie, Twitterrific, and Feedalizr. The service is free to use over the web, but using SMS may incur phone services provider fees.|`|Mz1I71gVaa	ummm, you jst type in what youre doing, and you can follow people (like famous people) on it, such as lily allen, (lilyroseallen) jonathan ross(wossy) etc.<br>  its quite good, but gets boring after like 2 mins.

zorYTX59aa	If you keep getting "HELLO, YOU EITHER HAVE JAVASCRIPT TURNED OFF OR AN <br>  OLD VERSION OF ADOBE'S FLASH PLAYER....GET THE LATEST FLASH PLAYER",<br>  and people are suggesting you either use or get something, DO NOT TOUCH A THING.<br>  <br>  You will get absolutely nowhere messing around with "Java", <br>  "Flash" or different web browsers -- and definitely avoid any<br>  software that sales-pimps (disguised as answerers here on <br>  Yahoo) are trying to "sucker" you into buying.<br>  <br>  None of those things will help you, because your computer <br>  and YouTube were working perfectly fine a while ago, right? <br>  The first rule-of-thumb and best option should ALWAYS be:<br>  don't disable, erase, uninstall, switch, download, alter, add, <br>  change or install anything. That'll only make matters worse.<br>  <br>  I'm 100% positive both your "JavaScript" and "Flash Player"<br>  are fine. Nothing about watching YouTube videos has really<br>  changed in the past couple of years. If anything, the newer<br>  Flash Players have been known to give many YouTubers a <br>  lot of trouble, especially all 5 variations of version 10. (Why <br>  in the world is there a 10.0.525, 10.1.218, 10.2.26, 10.2.54<br>  and 10.12.36? The only thing that most upgrades are good <br>  for is their potential to create all kinds of software conflicts).<br>  <br>  Your problem may fix itself within a couple hours, or by the<br>  next day, because YouTube often "shuts down" a bunch of<br>  their own servers every single day without warning anybody, <br>  in order to update all kinds of stuff. During those occasions, <br>  it's really YouTube's data transmissions of "Java" or "Flash" <br>  that are poor -- not yours.<br>  <br>  If, by the following day, YouTube is still stuck and showing<br>  you those awful "JavaScript" and "Flash Player" messages, <br>  it'is possible that your subdirectories of "temporary internet <br>  files" and memory (many times called "cache") are entirely<br>  maxxed out and can't take anymore -- the end result being<br>  that YouTube videos cannot even make it onto your screen.<br>  <br>  "Temporary internet files" are 1000s of tiny bits of websites<br>  permanently put on your computer's hard-drive. They'll stay <br>  there forever and ever, gradually plugging up your computer <br>  much like hair slowly clogs a sink drain, until you get rid of <br>  them. The solution to that is to first exit YouTube and clear<br>  your "cache" of all its "TIFs" as well as your "cookies" and<br>  and "history". Then reboot.<br>  <br>  If you're not sure how to clear your "cache", or if you would<br>  like more tips on making YouTube run even better, (without <br>  having to buy or install anything), click my avatar and send<br>  me a message/note with your YouTube username or email <br>  address. I'll guide you step-by-step on how to clear "cache" <br>  (plus my tips) in plain English, with full explanations.<br>  <br>  Note 1: if you've got Google Web Accelerator or something<br>  similar to it...dump it, burn it, trash it, disable it, uninstall it; <br>  do all you can to get rid of it -- even though this contradicts <br>  my advice uptop. GWA conflicts with YouTube. Clicking on<br>  "Don't Accelerate This Website" won't help you whatsoever. <br>  (Some downloaders and converters also ruin YouTube too.)<br>  <br>  Note 2: longer videos only require "Flash" and "Shockwave"<br>  in order to play smooth. Other than that, avoid all the sales <br>  pitches that some Yahooers are shilling, because they are <br>  really disguised sales-people and peddlers. Their "answers" <br>  have nothing to do with your problem, and their wares may<br>  worsen your problem. Besides, what kind of selfish answer <br>  is that? [my paraphrase] "Although you cannot even watch <br>  or access videos, buy our downloader."<br>  <br>  Note 3: a very odd fix that once worked for me was altering<br>  the URL from "www.youtube.com" to simply "youtube.com"<br>  (or you could even try "ca.youtube.com").<br>  <br>  Note 4: if you think that "Flash" might be the problem, you<br>  should perhaps consider 9.45 or 9.47. I have never strayed <br>  away from 9.47, and lots of "flashers" swear by 9.45. Think<br>  of those two as you would Windows XP compared to Vista.<br>  Please consider this previous "Best Answer" of mine, then<br>  check out the Asker's comments afterwards:<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/?qid=20081125075929AABZpVS">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/?qid=2...</a><br>  <br>  I hope that my information proves somewhat helpful for you.<br>  <br>  Internet Explorer 6:<br>  → Tools → Internet Options <br>  → Delete Cookies → OK<br>  → Delete Files → OK<br>  → Clear History → Yes <br>  → OK<br>  <br>  Internet Explorer 7:<br>  → Tools → Internet Options → Delete...<br>  → Delete files → Yes<br>  → Delete cookies → OK<br>  → Delete history → OK<br>  → Close (browsing history window)<br>  → OK<br>  <br>  Mozilla Firefox<br>  → Tools → Clear Private Data<br>  [x] Browsing History<br>  [x] Download History<br>  [x] Saved Form and Search History<br>  [x] Cache<br>  [x] Cookies<br>  → Clear Private Data Now|`|uV1kllrVaa	javascript is usually turned on by default...so, it might be your flash player is outdated..<br>  <br>  you can try a different browser...<br>  <br>  these will help you...<br>  <br>  1.

AA12041135	If you own the songs, yes. What I mean by owning them is not just downloading the song off of iTunes. I mean they are your songs, and you have all of the rights to them.<br>  Or, if you get permission to provide them on the site from whoever does own the songs, yes.|`|BhNP2P8Xaa	No, it's not illegal. Lots of bands and artists make some of their songs available for free.|`|3XMCQ4Spaa	It depends.  If you got permisson from the copyrightholders (eg. they put their songs up on your site themselves), or you pay a fee to the organization(s) that handles royalties for music in your country or to the particular record-companies directly.  Of course, unless you made some killer deals on advertising, you're likely to loose much more money than you can hope to make.<br>  <br>  Alternatively, you could put-up music to witch the copyright (the text) and phonetic rights (preformance/recording) have expired.  You need to check your local law, but I believe it would be *recordings* that are older than 50 years or so (eg. the first stuff Elvis Presley made has now expired, so anybody could re-release it).  I'm not sure if you could legally use a CD released 10 years ago with a 50 year old (expired) recording re-released on it... I think probably not (but I don't know).|`|ldJXd0NGaa	Yes, it's illegal to suppy copyrighted songs for download.  But unless a LOT of people start downloading them (and you put a LOT of songs on the site) it's pretty unlikely that anyone will ever know you are doing it.<br>  What's the URL, hee hee.  (Just kidding).<br>  <br>  Good luck,<br>  Donk|`|28VCKqDIaa	it might sound legal.<br>  <br>  <br>  but yea, it is illegal!<br>  :)<br>  <br>  <br>  just like limewire is illegal.|`|2fIsVJEcaa	Don;t do it . just don't do it|`|jGhOJKl5aa	That all depends. If the files are directly hosted onto your website's server, than depending on your country's laws, yes it can be illegal, but if downloading music is legal in your country (such as Canada for example), than you should be able to do it. If the files aren't hosted on your server and it's illegal in your country, they technically shouldn't be able to do anything to do, but they can do something to whomever is hosting the material.<br>  <br>  The simplest way to get around this, is to upload .zip, .rar, etc files full of albums or simply even a song and upload them to RapidShare or a service such as that and name the file something original, something that makes it seem like the opposite of what it actually is. If your uploading a file with music on it, name the file picturesprom2008.rar or something like that. Thus you aren't hosting the files onto YOUR server, and instead RS will have to deal with copyright laws, but they never get in trouble, instead usually before they can get in trouble, someone ends up reporting the file(s) to RS and thus the file gets deleted.<br>  <br>  Simple as this: As long as you don't host the file onto your server, and your not disobeying terms of use, if you are running off  a sever system such as FreeHostia or something, than it's pretty much legal. All you have to do is put the links onto your website and it's really not illegal.|`|EiWvaYqzaa	Well, it would be fine if you paid the artist for every single song downloaded. It is like Limewire or Frostwire, if you haven't paid for the songs then you cannot sell them.|`|GUqoQBLEaa	If the song are giving to you with rights or released under GPU licence then its not illegal to set up the site, but if the songs are copyrighted then its illegal to provide the service where people can download free.|`|GokA3YGkaa	You have to obtain a license from the recording company to do that.

BFTtW0gSaa	Swoopo is total crap. I believe that they have their employees bidding along with customers to both increase the bid and increase the popularity of their website. I mean think about it. It costs .75 cents to place a bid but the bid only increases a penny. I was just watching a tv that was at 148 dollars that means 14800 bids. Which means so far they have made over $11,000 on one TV and with bids still going. I can tell you they are NOT making that much money. If they were you would see them on every other commercial on tv and ads thrown up EVERYWHERE online. So I believe they may make about thousand bux over the cost they pay for something but not nearly as much as they appear to be making.|`|IGJGUfjNaa	Its safe according to McAfee Site Advisor.

tOCESHLYaa	I'm going to have to disagree with your other answers. If anything could be hacked no banks would be safe no Information would be safe. A firewall will stop any hacker. When an attack does come out that can get through router, or firewalls usually they have a fix for it. Most hacks come from the inside and go out. So first you have to get infected, then the hacker program lets your information out. A hacker can't get through you firewall to see what's on your computer. It's rare that a hacker just gets in to a computer. If you go to  a good web site that's been infected the hacker attacks your computer. If you have a know security hole then they are able to get in. If everything on your computer is update then they fail. In the last year I've probably hit over two dozen web sites that have attacked my computer. Everyone has failed. So If someone just picks you and decides to ping your computer and hack you that won't happen. Even Windows firewall would stop it. You are right, and your friend is right in a way. There is a very long shot, that it could happen. You can look here at answers every single infection is caused by downloads, visiting web sites, clicking on something they shouldn't have. I've never seen where anyone has been hacked by a straight hack aim at them. It's very popular to say anyone can be hacked. But I read a lot of security information about current threats and getting through a secure computer is rare.|`|1fgMq7o7aa	Your friend is right. Anything can be hacked in. Each weapon has a counter weapon. Kids hacked NASA Computer so why shouldn't a hacker penetrate yours. Of course it has to be a very experienced one.<br>  I wouldn't worry if I where you. <br>  Why should anyone be interested to hack your PC ? Do you have important data ? If yes store it on an external device. Never keep such data on your computer !|`|08aa25852d53d689f07afc8993ca4ea6aa	actually hackers do have a way of finding what items you have on your computer. its just matter how much effort they want to put in to hack your pc and completely hijack it. just make sure you have anti-virus to protect your pc. usually hackers are on miRC a program where you should be careful.

Follow the instructions and you have a login system.<br>  As for the IP, I would suggest you add a field to the table to include the IP address.<br>  To get it:  $ip = $_SERVER[REMOTE_ADDR];<br>  Once the person tries to log in, compare that IP with the authorised one.  Not only will (s)he need to have the right IP, but also the correct user/password.<br>  You can check your DB for "double entries" ie two identical entries with different users: kill one of them!|`|7bf62358ee706efffb78c25a9c7d5a00aa	Since 99.9% of your users will have a dynamic IP, mask it - check only the first 3 octets.  IOW, if the IP is 1.2.3.4, check 1.2.3.  You can't make it perfect (allow that user all the time and no other user any time), but that allows the user to use his account without having to change his IP in your database every time his provider changes it (which is every 24 hours with some providers).<br>  <br>  And you can't stop someone with sharing his account with all members of his household - they all get the same public IP.  (If it's a college dorm account, everyone in that college's dorms gets the same public IP, so you can't prevent account sharing, only simultaneous account using - 2 people on an account at 1 time.)|`|27MkQ7gXaa	you will have to watch out for proxy servers too.<br>  Just set a session token in the database and tract it.

AkBx09UGaa	You will more than likely have to replace the LCD if the scratch is so bad you can't ignore/work around it.  To my knowledge... there are no laptop screen repair kits that really work.  They are offered, but I've never heard anything good about them.<br>  <br>  Here are some tips... can't promise they will work though:<br>  <br>  Vaseline Method<br>  Clean the surface of the screen. <br>  Take some Vaseline and fill the scratch with it. <br>  Gently wipe off the excess Vaseline, being careful not to press too deeply so as to leave some inside the scratch. <br>  Voila. Hypothetically, this works because the optical density more closely matches the LCD face than air. However, it can make the scratch more noticeable. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Pencil Eraser Method<br>  Find a pencil with a clean, soft eraser. It must have no pencil graphite on it as you won't want to smudge that on your monitor. <br>  Lightly rub the eraser over the scratch or nick on the screen. <br>  Keep rubbing until the scratch completely disappears [1]. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Scratch Repair Kit<br>  Type this into a search engine: +LCD +Scratch +Repair <br>  The plus sign makes the search results include those words. <br>  Maybe Scratch Pro will work for you. <br>  Either way, test any repair ideas on something unimportant (if possible).|`|woGeAtddaa	You're out of luck.

7bf62358ee706efffb78c25a9c7d5a00aa	OZ is almost correct - the program doesn't matter, programs in Windows use whatever fonts are installed in Windows.  People write things for the web not understanding that the user has to have the font and, if the user's computer doesn't know what "Zergyl" should look like, it just inserts boxes.  (The font should be specified, then the font family, then serif or sans-serif - so the computer can use SOME font.)  It's the fault of the person making the page - there's nothing the user - you - can do about it.  (You can check to see what fonts your friends have installed, and install all the ones you're missing from their lists, but that's about it.)|`|6b20b31ca0cc72763d8a38403afd5bcbaa	Thats a format that your computer cant read. It was written with Word or Word Perfect or another program that you dont have installed on your computer|`|kWxhWET7aa	This is a matter of font choice. Certain characters of the English language are stored in every font used here in the U.S.A. This is called the ASCII character set. However, ASCII only supports the English language, and more specifically, only U.S. English (i.e. If you're from Australia, you need more than just ASCII characters.)<br>  <br>  The squares are what are affectionately known as NON-Printable U.S. character codes. The long and short of it is, that the font you are using for your page does not understand that characters you are inputting.<br>  <br>  If you want a better font, look for one that is UNICODE. UNICODE supports most of the entire world's languages, and all those special little characters that whoever 'pimped' you myspace page didn't even know anything about.|`|Vb92NEJtaa	it means that ur computer is to old to read certain text try upgrading or buying a new 1

You don't need it unless  your network spans multiple IP networks (you are not all in the same IP/Subnet range)<br>  <br>  DNS simply translates a host/domain into an IP address so that you don't have to know the IP address of every web site or resource you want.<br>  DNS is necessary if you want to use names instead of IP address on your network.  You theoretically could get by with just SMB, but there are many resolution issues with it, and it's not really a good substitute.<br>  <br>  The whole internet depends on DNS to work correctly, so that you can type "www.yahoo.com" instead of 209.131.36.158 to get to yahoo.

You can also buy a new domain instantly, or host your existing domain for free and make it your own (www.yourown.com)<br>  <br>  If your looking for something more advanced but still user friendly then try XsitePro, Sitebuilder Designs or Calvary Studios, they have everything you need in building your own website: domain name registration or domain transfer, web hosting, web builder, site maintenance and email accounts. Everything is laid out in an easy to follow step by step instruction. Some of the features included enable you to add your own themes, videos, images or mp3 music making your site unique to you. Pricing is comparable and affordable too. <br>  <br>  I hope that I was of some help and answered your question.

Use the object - fill in members (name, address, etc.).  Use the data.  Destroy your object whern you're through with it.<br>  <br>  It's just a matter of applying the particular class to the general class stuff you've been taught (I *hope* you were taught classes before being given an assignment to create and use them).  In order to be even a fairly competent programmer, you have to be able to apply the general to the specific all the time.  If you don't think like that (it takes being left-brained), you shouldn't think of taking a programming class for anything more than getting a general feel of how it's done.  If you always see problems in terms of solutions, you should have no prob lem with this assignment.|`|fIspYkGHaa	pretty srue its ok

9QVzSMT8aa	I bought a gateway laptop at Best Buy in May 2006.  I've used it extensively--almost everyday.  Even wrote a thesis on it.  <br>  <br>  I paid less than $700 for it.  I also purchased the extended warrenty at best buy for it.  <br>  <br>  I've had no major issues with it.  However--my major complaints are the cheaper quality materials used to construct the casing.  I had to send it in to best buy to repair because one of the hinges broke and I could no longer close the screen all the way (this repair would have cost over $400 without my warranty!!)  <br>  <br>  Also--the battery power sucks.  I got a new battery from best buy and really--even this one only lasts like 45 minutes at best.  <br>  <br>  but like i said--i paid less than $700 (and this was back in 2006 so the price was more inflated).  other than the issues I've mentioned--I've never had any problems.  doesn't crash, overheat, anything.  If you go to look at the newer ones, make sure you check out the hinges and quality of the materials used to make sure that it's going to last.  <br>  <br>  I would recommend Gateway.  Also--I've heard good things about Sony Vaios--we have a sony vaio desktop back home and that thing just keeps truckin--I think we've had it since 2001.

uTJsoYzzaa	Wifi doesn't exist everywhere, you have to have a box transmitting (giving out) the waves before your computer can pick them up.  These boxes are very SHORT RANGE and usually limited to certain area (i.e. a coffee shop, hotel or trailer park depending on how large the range is).  So, if you're livin' out in the boonies (excuse the expression), you won't be able to pick up wifi unless you have a box installed in your house transmitting it.<br>  <br>  What my family uses is a little thing by Verizon that looks like a walkie-talkie and plugs into a USB port in your computer.  This picks up LONG RANGE signals that are sent from place to place by towers (a lot like a cell phone).  Also like a cell phone, not only do you have to buy the device, but also a monthly service.  Anyway, I don't have their website offhand, but I'm sure you can google it and investigate from there.  The pin is UM150.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps,<br>  God Bless,<br>  jazmagirl

kkJcYGVUaa	Well off the top of my head I know you can use avi without converting and of course WMV. umm Can't remember what else without looking. But I use it allot myself. some formats you must convert. My favorite converter is Prism video converter, you can find it here ? Been using it for well over a year. I'll never (unless something amazing comes out) use anything else. I am still using the trial version. which allows you to convert 300 videos. Then all you do is delete and reinstall which is very fast and easy. I've done it a thousand times? But I love it. I gotta pay for it sometime. It's a great program. It converts many video formats back and forth, very quick and very easy. . I didn't mean to get away from your question. I think I answered it. Most of it. You can use avi in DVD maker. But if you happen to have a format that you cannot use and need a converter. Definitely try Prism.|`|e10jkZy4aa	You can try ConvertXtoDVD, it is easy to convert and burn all your videos and convert AVI to DVD!

gWlmU1KJaa	its a power saving thing on a laptop, speedstep on an intel, or powernow with your amd processor<br>  <br>  only when the processor is asked to do some work does it speed up<br>  <br>  <br>  PowerNow! is speed throttling and power saving technology of AMD's processors used in laptops. The CPU's clock speed and VCore are automatically decreased when the computer is under low load or idle, to save battery power, reduce heat and noise. The lifetime of the CPU is also extended because of reduced electromigration, which varies exponentially with temperature.<br>  <br>  The technology is a concept similar to Intel's SpeedStep technology. The adaptation of PowerNow! for AMD's desktop CPUs is called Cool'n'Quiet. Newer Opterons also use an adaptation of PowerNow! called Optimized Power Management.

b2qdwABVaa	the single ( | ) means OR in Java and most other high level programming languages which is a bitwise operator that usually is used to set bits, and the double ( || ) in Java and most other high level programming languages is the boolean or operator.

If the white spots in the preview (the will-be selection area) are more towards your dog, then that's good.<br>  <br>  Also, if you want a much nicer-quality result, use masks. There should be a window for masks on the top right panel, next to Adjustments. Duplicate your current layer, and use Replace color to generously replace color. Don't worry about also replacing the hat. The point of masks is to non-destructively fine tune and edit things like this. In the masks panel, with the new color layer selected, click on Add a Pixel Mask (the one with a circle and a plus sign). Now that you have a mask over the original, untouched image, grab your soft-edged eraser and erase the unwanted parts. When you're done cleaning it up, right click on the layer mask in Layers and apply it. That's all there is to it.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps!

mr1XoGSQaa	It really depends on what you are looking for in a browser. Internet Explorer has been around for ages, and has the full support of Microsoft behind it. It's got over 70% of the market share and as a result is recognisable to almost everybody. It is sleek and powerful, but on old(ish) computers that may slow you down a bit. Still, as the standard browser, you won't find many other negatives with it.<br>  Internet Explorer 8 RC1: <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/internet-explorer/beta/worldwide-sites.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/windows/interne...</a><br>  <br>  Mozilla FireFox is a highly customizable browser. It has the advantage of being the one of only browsers that is compatible with all operating systems. New themes and gadgets are released every week, and this gives a personal feel to it when viewing websites. Although it slows the computer down, it isn't as bad as IE, though on a fast computer, you won't notice much of a difference between the two.<br>  FireFox 3.0.7: <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/all.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/all...</a><br>  <br>  Other options available are Opera Browser. This browser offers very limited customization features (only a colour change in fact), but because of this gives very fast browsing. It was mainly developed for low memory computers, and is more of an "Internet Suite" than just a browser. It provides users with the tools and technology to perform a wide variety of internet related tasks like viewing web pages, searching the Internet, sending and receiving emails, conducting online chats, and even displaying the latest Widgets. It doesn't require as many resources as IE or FF, but it isn't very fun to browse in something that looks as out-of-date as it does.<br>  Opera 9.64: <a href="http://www.opera.com/download/" rel="nofollow">http://www.opera.com/download/</a><br>  <br>  The final major browser is Apple Safari. In my opinion it is the fastest of the 4 browser and my personal favourite. Its style is based on the iTunes layout and it doesn't offer any customizability, but if you like iTunes, you'll love this browser. Its major downfall is the fact that it doesn't render (load) webpages very well. This can become very irritating while browsing so most people don't give it a second thought. It has many of the same features as IE and Firefox, including: QuickTime multimedia technology, a tabbed-browsing interface system, and internet searching tools. It does run very fast (even on slow computers) and has the best startup time of all browsers. If you find that the pages you usually visit work fine on Safari, you won't have anything bad to say about it.<br>  Safari 3.2.2: <a href="http://support.apple.com/downloads/Safari_3_2_2_for_Windows" rel="nofollow">http://support.apple.com/downloads/Safar...</a><br>  <br>  A new introduction to the Browser market is Google Chrome, Google's first attempt at an internet browser. It is now out of beta mode and it seems to be one of the fastest browsers out there. It is still fairly new on the Browser market so extensive testing ahsn't been does, unlike IE or FireFox, yet it is already the main browser used by many professionals. It isn't customizable, but Google have announced that they intend to allow plugins like FireFox, so it won't be long until they have plenty of add-ons to keep us happy.<br>  Google Chrome 2.0.167.0: <a href="http://www.majorgeeks.com/Google_Chrome_d6037.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.majorgeeks.com/Google_Chrome_...</a><br>  <br>  So it really depends on what kind of person you are and what type of computer you have. You can't go wrong with IE or FF, but under stress, they perform slowly, Opera is a boring looking browser but can run where the other two can't, Safari has problems with rendering many webpages and there are far too many security risks with Chrome, but is much the fastest of them all. I personally use four of them (don't really enjoy the experience with Opera) and have no problem with any of them, though IE 8 and Google Chrome are the two I use most.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps~|`|nhG4hUNAaa	Have you tried to update fire fox recently (go to help and selct update) or even try Internet Explorer<br>  <br>  Peter

jLe6GDu8aa	When I develop websites, I have general rule of thumb. A basic website with roughly five to seven pages is a base price of $250.00. From there, I add on more money as appropriate.<br>  <br>  For a simple login system for news letters or updates to the website, it's an additional $200.00. For an advanced login system with support for users to register to the website, it's $500.00 at least. It takes a very long time to code something like this from scratch.<br>  If the person wishes to use open source software instead of having me create things custom, I charge a base price of $250.00 for installation of open source software and additional fees for customization to the open source product.<br>  <br>  Logins, shopping carts, any fancy applications on a website that do something are written in a server side programming language in conjunction with a database. If I've lost you so far, try some of the following links:<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_...</a><br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server-side_scripting" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server-side...</a><br>  <br>  Some popular languages for server side programming or scripting is the following:<br>  - PHP<br>  - ASP.net<br>  - Java<br>  - Ruby<br>  <br>  Some popular databases for storing data on a website:<br>  - MySQL<br>  - PostgreSQL<br>  - MSSQL<br>  - Oracle SQL<br>  <br>  Many people get turned away when wanting a website developed. People don't realize to do it the right way, it takes time and many painful hours of raw coding sometimes, especially when programming things like logins.<br>  Your website for the Storage Made Simple looks very nice for a beginner at HTML. My only suggestion is you pick some nicer fonts for the web page. Everything else looks pretty decent! If you were interested in hiring someone to program a login system, I am available and have a good portfolio but you need a a server that supports a server side programming language.<br>  <br>  As for these "experts" on this page telling you not to use tables for your website, you don't have to listen to them! CSS is very useful and convenient for styling elements on a page and I support using it to a certain extreme, but tables are much more cross browser compatible when you want to create 2 or 3 column layouts on your website. Furthermore, CSS was invented to make building websites easier. If you try applying to every single element on your web page, you will end up wasting time and therefore, soil the purpose of what CSS was created for. <br>  Personally, I use CSS for backgrounds, text, links, nearly everything except for layouts because there is no legitimate way yet to create column layouts in CSS without time wasting hacks. I've gotten code from my college books that hasn't even worked! Coding columns in CSS is a waste of time and I will gladly have an argument with anyone who thinks CSS is better than tables for layout. The only arguments CSS has over tables for layout is it loads faster. But what good is a website if it doesn't look good to everyone that visits it?<br>  <br>  I hope I gave you some good tips on web design and prices on web development and programming. Feel free to contact me with any questions!|`|7bf62358ee706efffb78c25a9c7d5a00aa	1) It's not an upgrade, it's a "do from scratch".  No one is going to upgrade a site done in tables.  (Positioning is done in CSS, and has been for a while.)<br>  <br>  2) You can get it done from anywhere from $100 (rent-a-coder - if you get what you want, and while your kids are still this side of 90, you'll be one of the few), or you can work with a real web developer and pay at least a few thousand - more if you want anything more than what you have and what you posted.<br>  <br>  In web design, you usuaally get what you pay for.  Do you want a kid working for gas money?  Or do you want someone who knows the legal ramifications in the US (you're storing information that your users give you - what happens if someone steals it), proper security design (storing passwords in plain text is dangerous, md5 is better, sha1 is still better), methods of protecting the site, etc.?<br>  <br>  Based on what I've seen of your site, some of the cheaper designers you can hire don't know as much about web design as you do, but they take $100 from anyone foolish enough to work without a binding contract, and can make a few thousand a week that way.  (You, of course, end up having to decide if it's worth your time suing someone with the home court advantage halfway around the world for $100.)<br>  <br>  Find a site that does what you're looking for.  Look for a web link or email address (usually down at the bottom in a small font) for the person who, or company that, designed the site, and contact them.  You already know that a) they deliver and b) you like their site.  Talking is free.  When you've settleed on exactly what you like, and what they can deliver, they'll give you a fairly accurate estimate, if not a guaranteed price.  If you're happy, sign a contract and you should have your site up and running by the agreed-upon date, if you pay the agreed-upon money on the agreed-upon schedule.|`|BgwTxzEFaa	You would have to learn javascript and or Flash/Actionscript, and perhaps PHP..

And I think flash would be even more expensive.  <br>  <br>  You also have to keep in mind that not everyone has a computer that can use flash.  It's rare, but who knows.<br>  <br>  I recently designed a user-login dynamic website for a scholarship, it took me about 2 weeks for everything (which I think was a little more complex than what you'd need), but I would have probably charged about $2000.  It all depends, it's a wide array of variables.<br>  <br>  If you have patience, and a lot of time before you really need the site, you can do it yourself.

This will tell you what sort of memory you need, what is the maximum you can put in your machine (sometimes the max is only 1GB) and what combinations eg some need matching pairs.

e41872f04716f3d972a1ebc178c328f4aa	1. Firefox is a separate browser and it will be installed separately. It is much lighter and faster compared to IE7 and even IE8 (for developers). Besides, it comes along with variety of addons which will make your browsing experience easy and comfortable. Addons replace many programs which you need to install to open or browse files etc. I would personally suggest Downthemall, NitroPDF, Videodownloadhelper, Flashgot etc. Various language translation addons are also available apart from Colourful tabs (especially for females). You can look at the screenshots & read comments for every addon before installing it. The latest and stable version of Firefox is 3.0.7 (for Windows) which you can download from www.firefox.com <br>  <br>  2. It is a clean and hassle free browser and same goes with the installation wizard. Just run the setup file and you can choose to make it your default browser (recommended) and import bookmarks from Internet Explorer (showed separately in Bookmarks menu in Firefox) during installation. It will take 1 min or 2 for clean installation. Once installed, just click on Tools>Options>Tabs and check the box for "Always show the tab bar". You would love to use firefox as you can reload all tabs, close all tabs, bookmark all tabs etc. in a single click. Furthermore, if accidently you closed any of the tabs, you can reopen the tab(s) from History menu>Recently closed tabs. If the system shuts down accidently, Firefox will save all the tabs and when you open it again, you can choose either to Restore Previous session (open previous tabs) or start new session. You can backup, restore, export and import bookmarks in the form of saved bookmark files or create .html files among various computers in no time. Firefox has alot of benefits compared to IE7. <br>  <br>  3. No, you don't have to make any updates to your yahoo homepage but I would recommend you to use google as your default search engine. For daily news and updates, firefox and its various addons can take care of that. Even the bookmarks toolbar has all the daily news for you. On the right top corner, you can choose which search engine you want to use. To change the default home page, click on Tools>Options>Main and select the option as you like.<br>  <br>  4. Reverting back from Mozilla Firefox to Internet Explorer 7 or 8 is same as reverting back from City A to City B. However, I would say, I haven't seen any flaws in City A yet honestly. You will be fully satisfied with Firefox. Do give it a try and be a part of the Mozilla community. I'm a proud user of Firefox. <br>  <br>  5. I would strongly suggest you to switch to Firefox. Google Chrome & Safari are two other options which you can consider but still Mozilla Firefox is considered the best. As Answerer1 mentioned, Safari is more on itunes platform and comes installed on Mac. Google chrome is good but not highly customizable. Since you are a Windows user, go for Mozilla Firefox. It is the best browser I have ever used.<br>  <br>  You don't have to do anything with IE. Just leave it as it is but do install the necessary security updates if you r a genuine windows xp user during Windows/Microsoft update or Automatic Updates. Just download the Mozilla Firefox setup file and run it. Once installed, experience the web in a new design and style. <br>  <br>  Recommendation: If you have any interest, do read about What's new in Firefox v.3.0.7, Features, Security, Customization etc. sections on www.firefox.com It will give you a thorough idea about why I'm recommending Firefox to you.<br>  <br>  Good Day & Good Luck!|`|mr1XoGSQaa	1) FireFox installs as a separate program to IE, you can hav both at the same time.<br>  <br>  2) Make sure you know whether you're setting FF as default internet browser, or if you wnat to keep IE as default<br>  <br>  3) No<br>  <br>  4) Easy, just start it up as you normally do<br>  <br>  5) It really depends on what you are looking for in a browser. Internet Explorer has been around for ages, and has the full support of Microsoft behind it. It's got over 70% of the market share and as a result is recognisable to almost everybody. It is sleek and powerful, but on old(ish) computers that may slow you down a bit. Still, as the standard browser, you won't find many other negatives with it.<br>  Internet Explorer 8 RC1: <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/internet-explorer/beta/worldwide-sites.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/windows/interne...</a><br>  <br>  Mozilla FireFox is a highly customizable browser. It has the advantage of being the one of only browsers that is compatible with all operating systems. New themes and gadgets are released every week, and this gives a personal feel to it when viewing websites. Although it slows the computer down, it isn't as bad as IE, though on a fast computer, you won't notice much of a difference between the two.<br>  FireFox 3.0.7: <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/all.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/all...</a><br>  <br>  Other options available are Opera Browser. This browser offers very limited customization features (only a colour change in fact), but because of this gives very fast browsing. It was mainly developed for low memory computers, and is more of an "Internet Suite" than just a browser. It provides users with the tools and technology to perform a wide variety of internet related tasks like viewing web pages, searching the Internet, sending and receiving emails, conducting online chats, and even displaying the latest Widgets. It doesn't require as many resources as IE or FF, but it isn't very fun to browse in something that looks as out-of-date as it does.<br>  Opera 9.64: <a href="http://www.opera.com/download/" rel="nofollow">http://www.opera.com/download/</a><br>  <br>  The final major browser is Apple Safari. In my opinion it is the fastest of the 4 browser and my personal favourite. Its style is based on the iTunes layout and it doesn't offer any customizability, but if you like iTunes, you'll love this browser. Its major downfall is the fact that it doesn't render (load) webpages very well. This can become very irritating while browsing so most people don't give it a second thought. It has many of the same features as IE and Firefox, including: QuickTime multimedia technology, a tabbed-browsing interface system, and internet searching tools. It does run very fast (even on slow computers) and has the best startup time of all browsers. If you find that the pages you usually visit work fine on Safari, you won't have anything bad to say about it.<br>  Safari 3.2.2: <a href="http://support.apple.com/downloads/Safari_3_2_2_for_Windows" rel="nofollow">http://support.apple.com/downloads/Safar...</a><br>  <br>  A new introduction to the Browser market is Google Chrome, Google's first attempt at an internet browser. It is now out of beta mode and it seems to be one of the fastest browsers out there. It is still fairly new on the Browser market so extensive testing ahsn't been does, unlike IE or FireFox, yet it is already the main browser used by many professionals. It isn't customizable, but Google have announced that they intend to allow plugins like FireFox, so it won't be long until they have plenty of add-ons to keep us happy.<br>  Google Chrome 2.0.167.0: <a href="http://www.majorgeeks.com/Google_Chrome_d6037.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.majorgeeks.com/Google_Chrome_...</a><br>  <br>  So it really depends on what kind of person you are and what type of computer you have. You can't go wrong with IE or FF, but under stress, they perform slowly, Opera is a boring looking browser but can run where the other two can't, Safari has problems with rendering many webpages and there are far too many security risks with Chrome, but is much the fastest of them all. I personally use four of them (don't really enjoy the experience with Opera) and have no problem with any of them, though IE 8 and Google Chrome are the two I use most.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps~

There’s a decent guide covering this that you can work through at My Slow PC (<a href="http://www.MySlowPC.co.uk/)" rel="nofollow">http://www.MySlowPC.co.uk/)</a> – click on the “Troubleshooting” link.  Here’s my advice from it:<br>  <br>  1.) Turn System Restore OFF so any infection that you remove is not restored.<br>  <br>  2.) Scan with a combination of the best detection utilities as you’ll find different scanners can sometimes pick up different infections.  E.g.<br>  <br>     * McAfee Stinger – a free stand-alone utility used to detect and remove specific viruses.<br>     * SpyBot Search & Destroy – a spyware/adware scanner<br>     * Lavasoft Adaware – for spyware/adware<br>  <br>  Note – it might be a good idea to disconnect your network connection once you’ve updated them with the latest virus/spyware definitions.  This is due to the fact that often an infection is trying to spread over your network.<br>  <br>  3.) If the above fails or you’re not sure if you’re still infected, when you start your PC tap the F8 key, select “Safe Mode” and repeat the scans once you’re connected.<br>  <br>  I hope the above helps, as mentioned the guide above is a lot more detailed and the My Slow PC site is pretty useful.

Around about 11pm people who had their speeds capped are supposed to get their normal speeds back - at least I do anyway and I'm on Virgin, so maybe this is the cause, the fact that no one has their speed capped at the supposed off-peak hours. Just wait till they upgrade all the 2Meg users to 10Meg starting around June, it's not gonna get any better.|`|08sclDACaa	firstly virgin are rubbish (i know im with them ).... secondly if your down loading through the evening you will find between the hours or about 5pm till 11pm your speed will slow down on peaks n off peaks etc.... there is more traffic on the evening through connections so that will be another reason.... there is one thing that helps a little though, and thats to ensure every device , pc, laptop etc has their own IP address so that way each has their own connection to the main network so reducing the traffic in your household alone.

If the malware has changed your password, try logging in as Administrator.  By default, Administrator has no password.<br>  5.

When you're finished doing what you need to do, log out and reboot back into normal mode.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|lb0bYSgUaa	In order to successfully remove malware infections (viruses, spyware, adware etc) from your PC you need to follow a methodical approach as well as using effective (and free) tools.  There’s a decent guide covering this that you can work through at My Slow PC (<a href="http://www.MySlowPC.co.uk/)" rel="nofollow">http://www.MySlowPC.co.uk/)</a> – click on the “Troubleshooting” link.  Here’s my advice from it:<br>  <br>  1.) Turn System Restore OFF so any infection that you remove is not restored.<br>  <br>  2.) Scan with a combination of the best detection utilities as you’ll find different scanners can sometimes pick up different infections.  E.g.<br>  <br>     * McAfee Stinger – a free stand-alone utility used to detect and remove specific viruses.<br>     * SpyBot Search & Destroy – a spyware/adware scanner<br>     * Lavasoft Adaware – for spyware/adware<br>  <br>  Note – it might be a good idea to disconnect your network connection once you’ve updated them with the latest virus/spyware definitions.  This is due to the fact that often an infection is trying to spread over your network.<br>  <br>  3.) If the above fails or you’re not sure if you’re still infected, when you start your PC tap the F8 key, select “Safe Mode” and repeat the scans once you’re connected.<br>  <br>  I hope the above helps, as mentioned the guide above is a lot more detailed and the My Slow PC site is pretty useful.  Good luck!|`|38ccd2e4feadc84ad07166662a2e5338aa	Copy all of the personal files on your computer.

wUqeZl3Saa	There are a variety of ways to "see" where you've been.<br>  <br>  Without any keyloggers or other spy programs, you can check history, cookies and any cache that may or may not have been cleared. There is also the auto-complete memory that is a bit harder to clear. Even if these things have been cleared, the files and disk space are only marked as available and they are not really deleted. Anyone with the right "undelete" program or other similar snooping program could find most of the info.<br>  <br>  Some of the better spy and parental control programs not only log keystrokes, but they take snapshots of the screen. Clearing this would mean having all the passwords to delete the logs. In the case of some of the spy programs, clearing them would begin with knowing that they were even there at all.<br>  <br>  There is also other snooping programs that are not directly installed on your computer. These watch internet activity and log all the web pages you visit and what you do with them. Typically these are found on corporate networks. Once they suspect something, then they'll simply stop by the office or cubicle and remove the computer for evidence. The person(s) examining the computer may not be trained in forensics and none of the data will be used in court unless there is a legal battle over how the person was fired.<br>  <br>  There are more ways to find out where you've been.

But theoretically, a hypervisor could be created that could run two operating systems at once at essentially full speed. However, because drivers and such would need to exist for such a system, it is not mainstream. Various early, barely usable products do exist however, but they aren't intended for general home use.<br>  <br>  I recommend getting a cheap, second pc and then networking them together.|`|WoESqX8gaa	If you have a desktop computer and you want multiple monitors, your best bet is to buy an external monitor and a second video adapter that supports multiple monitors.

You can find such video adapters for less than $200 at most electronics stores—just make sure that it's compatible with your computer and has connectors that match the monitors you plan to use.<br>  <br>  If you're a laptop user like me, you don't have the option of adding another video adapter, but your laptop might support using Dualview with an external monitor and the laptop's built-in display. If it does support Dualview, just do what I did: plug a monitor into the external VGA port of your laptop and turn on the Dualview feature of Windows XP. To turn on Dualview, follow these steps:<br>  <br>  1.<br>   <br>  <br>  Right-click the desktop, and then click Properties.<br>  <br>  2.<br>   <br>  <br>  In the DisplayProperties dialog box, click the Settings tab.<br>  <br>  3.<br>   <br>  <br>  Click the Display list and select your external monitor. If you do not see multiple monitors listed, your computer hardware may not support Dualview. You can still use MaxiVista to configure a second computer as an additional display, however.<br>  <br>  4.<br>   <br>  <br>  Select the Extend my Windows desktop onto this monitor option. Click Apply or OK.<br>  <br>  Now I can have different windows open on my laptop's built-in display and the external monitor. I can move windows between the two displays and even stretch windows across both displays. For more information on how to move from one monitor to the other, see Expand Your Workspace with Multiple Monitors and Dualview.|`|wPNtVytKaa	IT IS POSSIBLE - <br>  just not as dual boot<br>  <br>  And you can use windows as your primary OS.<br>  <br>  You can setup your dual monitors (you need two video cards or a dual card) and set up as described above, then use VMWare Server (free)  to load another OS of your choice, run the sucker, and maximize it in your monitor of choice.  I have this setup right now, works great.<br>  VMWare server gives you a choice of running it on Windows or Linux, just depends on what you want.  I run the Windows version and have a guest Linux running on VMWare.  <br>  Love it.|`|6OzEsanAaa	not even possible haha<br>  because when you set up a dual monitor<br>  then what your doing is basically either doing a mirror which shows the samething on both screens<br>  or you can extend your dekstop to make your screen bigger<br>  but you cant run to os at the same time|`|7aqEtfLRaa	You can't do that, you would have to be running one OS as a host OS, and run the other one in Virtualbox on the other screen.|`|seV3BW62aa	The only way to do that would be to run Linux as you primary operating system and then have VMWare simulate a windows-environment.

Your best source for information on that is portforward, but you'll have to choose a port at random, since they don't have chatspace listed (you could post a request that they add it once you find out which ports it needs).

It came free with my Comcast Internet Service.<br>  If you do a search online, from my experience, all you get are the "Trial Version" of a lot of bogus programs that will scan your computer but want you to pay for the service to remove the "viruses" that they find. But in the procees they throw all these nice Popups into your system. They in themselves are a virus in my opinion. So don't do an online search for "Free Virus Scan". Find out what your ISP is offering and go with what they have. Even if its not the best one out there. Its bound to be better than nothing.|`|4c6b2fe40508da1f4e4dbe41cc9e3650aa	Along with the anti virus you should probably also get an anti spyware.

MPldgkkMaa	There are a several reasons why your computer is freezing/slow. First question is when the last time you cleaned your registry. Having a corrupted registry can cause a whole host of errors and problems. Freezing up is one of them. If you have a lot of unnecessary registry keys that are hogging up your computer resources. Your computer is bound to choke. Scan your registry with a good registry cleaner. If you pull up more than 20 errors or duplication, clean your registry.<br>  Go to:<a href="http://downloadlk.com/themosteffectiveregistrycleaner.htm" rel="nofollow">http://downloadlk.com/themosteffectivere...</a> get one to free scan your pc<br>  <br>  2. Depending on your RAM specs and your computer usage. This could also be the issue. Having an insufficient amount of free space does not allow your RAM to function properly. If you are using a lot of RAM by net surfing or other activities without enough empty space your will get freezes. You don't need to buy new RAM but you should increase your free space by removing unnecessary data and perhaps increasing your virtual memory. The below link will show you how.<br>  <br>  3. Spyware could be the culprit, so do a scan and see if your computer is infected.<br>  Get the best one from: <a href="http://toptenantispywareviews.com" rel="nofollow">http://toptenantispywareviews.com</a> to scan your computer.<br>  <br>  4.

FBQZ06vraa	As far as I know, Word 2002 (I'm guessing that's the version you have) can't place a watermark on only certain pages.  It's the entire document or nothing at all.<br>  <br>  Sorry.|`|j3Px4JXfaa	Hi ikwilliams,<br>  <br>  My name is Ron, and I’m part of the Windows Outreach Team. I found some info that I think might help by typing “watermarks” into my Microsoft Office help section. Now, I’m giving info for Office 2007, so if you have an older version, you might want to type “watermark” in the help section of your own copy and compare to make sure things work out. Here you go:<br>  <br>  To add a watermark only to selected pages, you must separate the document into sections. For example, if you want to apply a watermark only to the table of contents in a document, you must create three sections: a cover page section, the table of contents section, and the rest of the document text in its own section.<br>  <br>  1. In Draft view, replace the page breaks surrounding the pages to which you want to add watermarks with section breaks. <br>  <br>  On the Page Layout tab, in the Page Setup group, click Breaks, and then click Next Page under Section Breaks.<br>  <br>  NOTE    When you insert a cover page in a document, it has a separate header so that you don't need to create a separate section for it if you're creating sections to add a watermark only to selected pages.<br>  <br>  2. Switch to Print Layout view. <br>  <br>  3. Double-click the document header area on the page where you want the watermark to appear. This opens the header. <br>  Microsoft Office Word places watermarks in the header even though they don't appear in the header.<br>  <br>  4. Under Header & Footer Tools, on the Design tab, in the Navigation group, click Link to Previous so that the headers are no longer linked. <br>  <br>  5. Double-click the document header area on the first page where you don't want the watermark to appear — for example, the first page of document text — and then repeat step 4. <br>  <br>  6. Click the page where you want the watermark to appear. <br>  <br>  7. On the Page Layout tab, in the Page Background group, click Watermark and select the watermark that you want. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps.<br>  <br>  Cheers,<br>  Ron<br>  Windows Outreach Team

Use the 8500.|`|tllMnGooaa	I have the 3200hd on a gigabyte board (built in card), on the dedicated memory in cmos/bios it lets me go upto 512, you can also select auto , but i prefer to give it max amount.<br>  <br>  Anyway i'm playing ghost recon 2 with it no problems, if that helps any.|`|l0tKMC50aa	memory of a card does not always mean its better. sometimes newer card has less memory, but supports more games, etc.|`|507yKDS3aa	go with the nvidia dude. according to what you said it has 512 mb of memory thats twice as much as the other.

Typical uses include creating graphics and logos, resizing and cropping photos, altering colors, combining multiple images, removing unwanted image components, and converting between different image formats.[2] GIMP can also be used to create basic animated images in GIF format. It is often used as a replacement for Adobe Photoshop, the most widely used bitmap editor in the printing and graphics industries; however, it is not designed to be a Photoshop clone.[3] The project's mascot is named Wilber.<br>  <br>  The project was started in 1995 by Spencer Kimball and Peter Matt is and is now maintained by a group of volunteers under the auspices of the GNOME Project.[4] The current version of GIMP works with numerous operating systems, including most Unix variants, Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X. Released under the terms of the GNU General Public License, the GIMP is free software.<br>  <br>  It works great for whatever you need to do as stated above, Download it today at <a href="http://www.gimp.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.gimp.org/</a>|`|V6igYf3oaa	Download a trial of photoshop off the adobe website and then use something like...<br>  <br>  <a href="http://punkcracks.nl.nu/" rel="nofollow">http://punkcracks.nl.nu/</a>|`|CXH8yOiraa	GIMP <a href="http://www.gimp.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.gimp.org/</a><br>  Its pretty much exactly like photoshop with all the tools and stuff.

They're free and good.  (Graphic Design is a lot more than computers - using a computer is just one of MANY tools in the field.  You should also learn pencil, charcoal, waterpaint, oils, etc.)|`|jzex4ncSaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  For the other Raster Images editing software, you can try one of these, they are free,<br>  + <a href="http://www.gimp.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.gimp.org</a><br>  + <a href="http://picasa.google.com/" rel="nofollow">http://picasa.google.com/</a><br>  + <a href="http://www.photobie.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.photobie.com/</a><br>  + <a href="http://www.photoscape.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.photoscape.org/</a><br>  + <a href="http://www.getpaint.net/" rel="nofollow">http://www.getpaint.net/</a><br>  + <a href="http://www.picnik.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.picnik.com/</a><br>  <br>  For free vector images editor<br>  + <a href="http://www.inkscape.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.inkscape.org/</a><br>  <br>  Online photo editor<br>  + <a href="http://www.photofunia.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.photofunia.com/</a><br>  <br>  here for some good tutorials<br>  + www.tutorialized.com/<br>  + www.gimp.org/tutorials/<br>  <br>  If those are not good enough, you can look in here for the list of image editors.<br>  + <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_raster_graphics_editors" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_...</a><br>  + <a href="http://viswiki.com/en/Pixel_image_editor" rel="nofollow">http://viswiki.com/en/Pixel_image_editor</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Regards,<br>  <br>  -de
