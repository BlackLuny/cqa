I sure found my stuff on 20north. they also manage the customs clearance.

SWvdcaPraa	Write about memories you have growing up going to their house. Things you could count on... like my grandma always had my favorite soup waiting for me. I used to play uno and skip-bo with them at their dining room table. The house always smelled like cookies. It's where I learned how to make a crazy quilt. My grandpa always sat in his chair and did crosswords. Talk about the warm feeling you had in your belly when you would pull up to their house. I don't know anything about your grandparents and you, but you can come up with some great memories. If it's for an assignment you can make some stuff up or exaggerate if you need to. It's not very likely your teacher will call your grandma to ask if her house smells like cookies. Good luck!|`|MvZR1E1Aaa	Grandparents house is your special place maybe because when you go there your grandparent tell u story about their past what they did good or bad you could learn from these things and you won't make the mistakes that they did.

U9n960GYaa	GREAT question.... and to give you a detailed answer, it would take several pages, but to be short about it...<br>  <br>  All names originated out of the native language of a particular region of the would and their religions.  Most all names have a meaning behind them (i.e. someone who has the last name Brewer has in the past had someone in the family many years back that was indeed a brewer of beer).<br>  <br>  The reason all names don't sound the same is they are basically pronounced in there native tongue, but the meaning of the name could mean the same everywhere.The Jewish people years ago were the recorded first people to give individuals a last name, the Christians soon followed.  These were so everyone could figure out what group of people (clan) each belonged to.  Think of it as an early ID system..<br>  <br>  Native Americans in this country (U.S.) would, on the other hand, name their children with a complete sentence or a phrase but when the early missionaries arrived, they taught it would be better and easier to give each a "Christin" name.<br>  <br>  First names arose out of the same situation as a surname, just for identification.  Yes, there are a lot of names that sound different in other tongues that have the same meaning but there are also many that really have no translation into English...<br>  <br>  So, basically.... if a name sounds different in another culture or language, the meaning of those names are basically the same... just pronounced differently...<br>  <br>  Hope this helps you out !!!

Avatar (<a href="http://avatars.yahoo.com">http://avatars.yahoo.com</a> ) and forget about using the 360 image.<br>  <br>  OTHER TIPS:<br>  *** If the 360 space is recently activated, you may want to wait a few days before changing settings, as Y/A may not recognize that you have a 360 space right away.<br>  *** You may want to enable all the communication options on your Y/A profile and/or enable the Simple URL option in your Yahoo! 360 "Basic Info" and "Blog" settings pages. Sometimes that helps make the Y!360 image appear in your Y/A profile for an unknown reason. You still may have to wait for anything to happen though.<br>  *** Although, some people have found limited success in continually trying to re-select the 360 image option in their Y/A profile. I recommend waiting though, as to not inadvertently cause further delay.<br>  *** Some people never see an image show up. You can always post a bug report (or piggyback on other's bug reports) on the issue at the Y/A forum: <a href="http://suggestions.yahoo.com/?prop=answers">http://suggestions.yahoo.com/?prop=answe...</a> . This link between Y/A and Y!360 has been buggy for years.

suPD7c3gaa	You don't need to email any documents you have stored there.  Just save them to your computer.  If the got erases when Briefcase closes down, it wouldn't be accidental. That's why Yahoo! is making sure we're aware it's closing down so we don't lose documents.  If it's on your computer, it won't get lost.  I would suggest that anything you put back on your computer (anything I had there was still on my computer anyway), I'd create a folder just for this purpose, and put anything you remove from Yahoo! Briefcase in that folder.  Then, at your leisure, you can find another file storage/sharing site like Briefcase.  There are many free storage sites.

I'm not really very good with politics, but I think that if they had kept just one provider, as it used to be in the past, then the government would be able to keep the price rises under control.

VnhqbMUZaa	I have sprint and received a text as well from diana@instead-of-you.com which stated: ava send you a special msg visit www.amongcoast.com.  I called sprint and they did not seem to care. I advised them that I was not going to pay for spam that was allowed on my phone and they said they were not responsible and even went as far as suggesting that it could be from me giving my phone number out.  After I pressed the issue and asked who I would contact, the only information she would give me was the main e-mail contact...I didn't know there was an abuse e-mail until I read it here.  In my e-mail I advised them that by reading comments on the web, other sprint customers have received these same spam texts and I would think that someone at sprint would want to investigate this and I'm not paying for spam which was allowed to attack my phone.  I don't even use text messaging, so I had them block all future texts.  <br>  I would encourage others to persue this issue also.  If we do nothing, neither will sprint.|`|rJ8TGFFnaa	i got one today at around 1:06pm saying "I just seen Alexandra's new site WOW it's www.amongcoast.com" and it was sent from april@imts-wv.com and my phone is sprint too|`|2FiIZhIOaa	I got a message at 1:45 from a susana@huntercan.com. It reads, "Charlene send you a special msg visit www.amongcoast.com". Know a few Charlenes but they would just contact me directly if they had something to share. I'm annoyed. Between the Jamaican Sweepstakes scams and the startup phone companies cheating the elderly I have enough disgust to go around...contacting Sprint. Their website also says you can e-mail abuse@sprint.net.|`|ZSnoAcIxaa	I've received several of these messages too. The general version of the text mentioned here was the most recent one. Other messages may say something different, but they all mention mail servers of legit sites/businesses. I would suggest that everyone contact Sprint (or whichever you have) and ask them to block the sender, but it appears that the source of the messages changes constantly. So basically I don't know what to do.<br>  <br>  I have heard of this happening to non-Sprint customers, but it looks like this particular instance is confined to Sprint.<br>  <br>  fyi mine is identical to yours, except it says "Nola's" site, the "from" e-mail address is "rosetta@itftaekwondo.com" (legit organization) and the website I'm instructed to visit is "amongcoast.com"|`|ACfASB23aa	I just received the same text message.

I wonder what it's all about? This is weird..|`|cGFdo92Naa	Lets understand what happened. <br>  You received a text message from someone you don't know asking you to visit a website, 'wow'. <br>  <br>  Okay, but the hook that got me to reply was the sentance: 'I have no idea how they would have got my cell phone number...'. <br>  My first response is: Are you serious? Do you really think someone hand picked you and has your cell#? The answer is NOBODY hand picked you and EVERYONE has your cell #.  Providers like sprint have a set of telephone numbers areacode-prefix-####. In addition you can recieve SMS messages from an email:<br>  <br>  T-Mobile: phonenumber@tmomail.net <br>  Virgin Mobile: phonenumber@vmobl.com <br>  Cingular: phonenumber@cingularme.com <br>  Sprint: phonenumber@messaging.sprintpcs.com<br>  Verizon: phonenumber@vtext.com<br>  Nextel: phonenumber@messaging.nextel.com <br>  <br>  So, with a very quick algorrithim, an SMS spammer could use brute force and SMS everyone. I got a similar message too.<br>  <br>  The next hook that got me to responce was the comments about who sent the email, and possibilities of 'breaking into a corprate email system to send the messages'... um, No! <br>  The fact is ANY computer can relay email. Further anyone can use a method called 'Email spoofing'  to make it seem as if they are <br>  Karin@xxxxx.xxx. There is nobody named Karin. There is just some computer nerd who knows how to do email spoofing (super easy) and wants people to traffic his website. <br>  <br>  I hope this helps!

POUuR7iuaa	They are a total SCAM!!!!<br>  <br>  They do not have a real phone system; it’s just a phone recording with no one really there. I called at least 30 times over the course of several days and left messages.<br>  <br>  I also thought it was suspicious that they want a GreenDot money pak for payment and do not accept major credit cards. <br>  <br>  Their address (7106 Lyndon Ave, Rosemont, IL 60018) is located in an 847 area code but the number is a 708 area code on the other side of town. Also all the business that were found in that area are no longer in business making me think they are using the address of an abandoned industrial/commerce park.<br>  <br>  Long story short, they took my money, stopped responding and have not shipped the Blu-Ray player. I'm working to get my money back and report them to the proper authorities.<br>  <br>  They also have a bogus domain registration. I'm not sure if Yahoo is aware of them yet.<br>  <br>  If it’s too good to be true it probably is!|`|9any1mJVaa	I agree. Last night I placed an order and thought it was really odd that they did not accept credit cards. Before I went to purchase the MoneyPak I waned to speak to someone.. But like the previous person's comments I could not get a hold of anyone.<br>  <br>  This site should be taken down!! <br>  <br>  Yahoo and Google should not put it as a top result when searching!!
AA11789493	Holly Hannah!!!!! I don't know anything about this, but if you have windows, go to add/remove programs and delete whatever program this is coming from and then start over.  If you have windows, you can go to the windows site and have your windows programs and hardware, including music player, updated for free. In the start menu, you may already have a program called Windows Update.  If so use that, is not go to www.windows.com or www.microsoft.com.  You can get all kinds of helpful things there, even drivers.
dd51697d2c2f5d437b4ee5f646ec148caa	The first step is to download an IM client. There are several popular clients available: Skype, MSN, Brosix.com. Each has their advantages and not everybody uses the same ones. <br>  <br>  Second step is to create a login name. Most of the instant messengers mentioned above and elsewhere will have a registration feature when it asks you to login. <br>  <br>  Third step is to invite friends. Again, most IM clients have a feature for inviting your friends via email. If you know your friends' emails then you can just invite them right out of the instant messenger window. <br>  <br>  At that point you should be fine! Have fun and don't get too addicted :)

The first icon in it is the ABC with a checkmark near it...That is spell check.<br>  <br>  if there is something else I am not aware of it...hope this helps...

AA11307940	Yahoo was contacted about this and they say it's a glitch, they have their engineer working on the problem. In the meantime open the inbox,click View All Messages, then unread messages, if you have any late arrivals or in folders they will show. This has been happen to many of us while using the Classic Mail since Yahoo has been upgrading the classic and their other sites, It did clear on it's own, it took a few days. They is no need for you to do anything. It will clear.|`|KxLOKzbiaa	maybe because you have a unread message... my mail box appear also like that but when i explore my mailbox, i saw un read messages so i read it all and the alert doesnt appear always exept if i accept new message...|`|19iD220Jaa	Check your spam mailbox if thats not it... im not sure, you may have to contact Yahoo.

mpCDEoriaa	scam, they send you a money order for more than the amount of the items, they want you to send them the difference, you deposit said money order, after a week or so the bank informs you that it was a fake money order, you send your good money to them and they usually use a fake id and get away scotch free with your money, the bank pulls the fake fund from your acct and sometimes come after you for fraud. dont do it unless you can meet in person for cash on craigslist. heard many horror stories|`|t4imJT9Eaa	scam! i tried selling my ipod touch on craigslist once, and i got this lady who wantedme to ship it to nigeria and she would give me 600 dollars.

f202428f23f47abf8c99a259c26fc13eaa	Delete all at once---Yeah----BUT----<br>  The only way is if you switched to "All New Mail".<br>  It has a continuous mail page which allows you to delete all at once. Click on "more actions"---then "check all" and then "delete".<br>  You can switch back to Classic afterward.<br>  <br>  To switch back and forth----click the link at the top of your mail page (next to "sign out") that says All New Mail---and click that same link to return to Classic, which will now say Classic.<br>  <br>  Otherwise, with Classic, it's page by page--as you've noted.<br>   BUT----- you can speed it up by changing the "messages per page" to 200 instead of 25. That makes it 8 times faster, with 200 at a time. <br>  <br>  Mail page>>options (top right)>>scroll to and click on "general preferences". Now, go down to *Folders/Search Results* and change the number in the box----then click a blank space (outside the box), to set the number, (so it won't roll to a different number), while you scroll to the bottom of the page to click "save".
