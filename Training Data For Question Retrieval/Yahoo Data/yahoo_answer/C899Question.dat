The cafe is simple, clean, white, al fresco where people can relax; trying to capture that feeling of stepping into a shade on a pouring/scorching day.      e.g. "hey, lets go 'in the shade'!"

20090305020352AAKjiO4	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	Is it possible to trade homes?	We have a small home with a small mortgage and have lived in this home for 18 years. Our son lives with us and has a good job and excellent credit. We also have excellent credit.   My son wants to buy our home and we would then buy a new home. The house we found is a short sale, so we cannot wait for him to buy our home and then put in an offer on the home we like as it might be gone. Don't want a contingency offer as it's a short sale.   Now here is the question:   If our son purchased the property we wanted to buy ( the one on the short sale) could we then trade homes after the sale or would we have to go through the closing process again with the banks etc.   What is the best way to do this. We live in FL.

The expensive item I bought on ebay was delivered to another state, and I haven't got response from the seller.      I paid hundreds of dollars on a camera on ebay, and the payment was made through Paypal, then, I got the tracking number from the seller, she sent it through USPS, and I just got the tracking information said the item was delivered in SILVER SPRING, MD, but I am actually in Salt Lake City, UT.      I double checked my address both on Ebay and Paypal, there are correct, since the tracking information said it is delivered, I assume someone has already signed on it, and am not sure I can get anything back.      So far, the seller and Ebay, whoever I contacted, has not replied, I don't know whose mistake is this, the seller, Ebay, or the USPS? I don't even know what the item will be if someone really want to play a trick with that.      I will really appreciate everyone who provide me some suggestion.      Thanks.

I finished a degree in engineering last year, up until then I've thought I've wanted to be an Architect, a Graphic Designer, an Engineer, a motorsports engineer, a pilot, a design engineer, and until most recently an engineer working on "green technology". Right now I'm researching careers in the RAF..      But as with absolutely everything i'm still thinking to myself "Is this what I want?". The truth is I've always been bad at this kind of thing, and I think that maybe I've enjoyed things more when I've just gone for it without too much thinking and enjoyed it for what it is, whatever it is.      But this is my career, The only thing that has stuck with me through my life is a love for Racing in motorsports, and a tiny bit of artistic designery flare I've had since I was young, but i've always wanted to keep them as a hobby, with little pressure so I can what I want, when I want.       Does anyone have advice on how they choose what they do? Or do they often not really have a choice?      Right now I'm going to tal to the careers section of the RAF and see what they have to offer, and go from there.

I work for a Consultant, it's just a 2 person Office me and my Boss, I am also a Part-Time Student with a Child.  My Boss never provided Health care Insurance (my son is covered under my Boyfriend, his Father).  My Bosses Business is struggling to maintain and pay his Bills, he has cut my hours twice, which has in turn cut my Salary by a lot,  Where as when I first starting working there 8 months ago I was bringing home close to 700 every 2 weeks while attending school.  Now I'm barely touching 400 while in school part time.  My Boss is a nice guy, and I feel for him but I also have to provide in my household  too (although my boyfriend has a job).  I'm wondering what should I do, is it better to get on unemployment and finish my degree, and try to find a new job.  Or wait it out at my current Job and hope that Business gets better and my hours can be changed back to what they used to be.  I live in New York City.

Being that we both signed his lease stating 30 days, is this legal or must he honor the 60-day law?

20070212212745AAhoMWA	Business & Finance;Credit	Collections has it wrong?	Ok, so my wife and I have been getting calls from a collection agency regarding a hospital visit from a year ago. There had been a mix-up with paperwork on the insurance company's end (hadn't had me listed as "spouce") and the bill hadn't been paid. We contacted the insurance and had it corrected. They paid the bill (we have the check number and date it cleared) but this collections agency keeps calling and says the bill's still outstanding even after we've sent them a copy of the notice from the insurance company. So here's my question: What's our next recourse? We've done everything we're supposed to do. We've contacted the right people and we're still getting hosed. And how do we get this removed from our credit report?
