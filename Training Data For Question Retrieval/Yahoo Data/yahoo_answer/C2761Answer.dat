The rustica recipe was created for the natural, it is fire roasted red peppers, basil marinated roma tomatos and natural sliced sausage.

Dumb@$$|`|1kQLOxpAaa	If you're the waiter you should get all of your tips, but keep in mind you may also have to tip the bus boy, hostess, bartender and anyone else who helps you with your tables from beginning to end. Cheating them on tips will mean your tables  won't be cleaned as fast, you tables will be sat with people known to be cheap tippers or small parties, and your drinks will be bad or weak. Keep these things in mind.|`|OiUxoqcPaa	You can probably keep most of them, but the owner may take some.  They will be very low, though, so don't count on them.|`|rWnycDxOaa	Of course, every waiter has tips, so don't worry!

If you looking for mexican food you need to find a restarant that serves, stuff like sopes, huaraches, birria, menudo, pozole, mole, enchiladas, quesadillas, picadillo, chicarrones, carnitas, chiles rellenos, tamales...etc..    dam i am hungry now. Anyways..I have yet to find an authentic mexican restaurant that would blow me away..nothing compares to my tia's and abuelitas cooking..

If corner clock is a small family run business, then expect it to be run like a family runs it. Picture Thanksgiving or another major food related holiday at your house.   Most restaurants of this kind are the same. You will probably be doing busboy/dishwasher at both places. It's standard entry level in a restaurant. So basically, which place do you like better?  Which one is busier? Busier=time goes faster.  Which is closer to home?  What are the hours like? Both for you and for the place being open.   If you work 4-close, whats close? 10 or 12? And then there is clean up time. Just because the place is closed doesn't mean your off work.|`|VXcp8hvHaa	after which position, it should be how much?

Where people make comments about service, the food.     The whole thing takes a lot longer to film than it implies, because they have to do the different camera angles.

80OPj9gGaa	Citrus on the upper west side. It's one of our favorite places, really cool ambiance (not really quiet/romantic, but really cool), imaginative menu, GREAT drinks. It's a Latin/Asian fusion type of menu and they have great sushi and steak dishes as well (my personal favorite is the Brandt skirt steak with coffee infused bar-b-que sauce).    There's also a place over there called Ouest (pronounced "West"). Ouest is a little more traditional, American fare - lamb, lots of good fish and poultry dishes.    For my money, you can't go wrong with either one of those. Both take reservations, and they're easy to find (Citrus is at 75th and Amsterdam and Ouest is on Broadway - I think they're right near each other).

Many food manufacturers have shrunk their products by attempting to keep the same package sizes.  They have been very tricky about it.  For example, peanut butter jars now have an indent at the bottom of the container to give you a few less ounces for the same money.  It appears to be the same size jar you've always purchased, but multiply that 1.5 ounce indent by millions of jars of peanut butter, at the same price, and the comapny is still earning a profit without actually raising prices.  Restaraunts and fast food joints are all shrinking product as well without us knowing it. Nobody's "telling" but the media has been passing this information along to us in fits and spurts.|`|sqPoFZ00aa	It seems like most fast food restaurants have been shrinking their burgers.

Seems like this might be a healthier route.  Not to mention knowing you can go to the store any day you'd like.|`|6JvAjG5kaa	Here are over 100 restaurants that give you free food on your birthday:    http://www.ehow.com/how_4518275_restaura...|`|AA11591273	On your Birthday many restaurants give free deserts.|`|v71arPUDaa	I reckon any of em if the special day is when they win the lotto|`|eDG0Hs6Baa	chipotle gives out free burritos if you dress up like a burrito on halloween.|`|ynGK7Fglaa	I heard that you can get a Free Grand Slam at Denny's tomorrow from 6 am til 2 pm.|`|7o9dhE7daa	Denny's is giving free "grand slams" tomorrow from 6am-2pm|`|V3HVvdyvaa	ohenrys give you a free steak dinner if you dine in all you need is a drivers license or id|`|uS07WAwcaa	Free pancake day is actually tomorrow :)  yay :)|`|VXcp8hvHaa	but did you know about the Denny's cook that gave the waitress a free salami?

TDlVhthjaa	Tough age group. I had a friend that was 19 once visiting and I remember doing the research: Webster Hall is the best venue I can think of.     On most other places I know, 18+ Admissions are only on Friday Nights. Sound Factory (46th Btwn 11th & 12th), and Exit (56th St. Btwn 11th & 12th). Are the better ones.|`|VXcp8hvHaa	chuck e cheese for that age group|`|Kb06TGUnaa	If you were with other 21 year olds I would say Pink elephant or Highbar but i dont think they'd let in 18-20 year olds. Try Websterhall, Exit, Opaline, Or Crash Mansion|`|I5AxDuOYaa	18 and 20 year olds???...oh god, its hard without any ID or a fake ID....  go to Webster Hall in New York City.|`|pbV7dnKKaa	That will be hard to find a place for underage when you are turning 21 but there are a lot of bars that have underage nights you could prob find for a sat night! Check out an online yellow pages to find places that play the type of music you like and then look them up to see when their 21 and under nights are!
AA11091233	It is turning into a big ball of dough in your tummy. You don't process the dough very well. Get thin crust if you don't already.     Sometime that day or the next, after or before you have the pizza....if you like yogurt or cereal...put 3 big tablespoons of ground flax seed in yogurt or cereal...works like a charm.  Plus drink lots of water.    Lactaid isn't the issue. I think it's the gluten that you don't handle well. Lactaid if for milk intolerance.     Tell them to put 1/2 the amount of cheese on the pizza and add your own parmesan on top...or get feta cheese...if you ask for 1/2 the amount of cheese...seriously you won't miss it. Ask for 1/2 the cheese and tell them to add more veggies.    Good luck!|`|hNa5oHxQaa	Pizza doesn't digest as fast as other foods.|`|Rg2ERXAtaa	no pizza is good for you|`|6xyeYjkkaa	Cheese tends to do that to people. Eat fruit and veggies to offset the effect of the cheese in the pizza.|`|VXcp8hvHaa	please don't stop eating pizza!|`|7bQUBYeNaa	That happens to my bf. Its the cheese!|`|7o9dhE7daa	Dairy (cheese) causes Constipation.  To make sure suckling drink enough mothers milk, and get enough sleep, mothers milk of every mammal contains opioid peptides enclosed in special proteins; casein, lactalbumin, beta-lactaglobulin and lactoferrin.This sedative effect of these peptides however can also cause constipation Babies easily absorb these molecules into the blood, but in older people a larger part remains in the digestive tract, sedating the bowels more effectively.
bZud91iuaa	Make sure you have your parents credit card and there is room on it for about $200.00.  Oh and leave a decent tip|`|ku7s4H83aa	http://www.ruthschris.com/Menu/Entrees     check out their menu..yummy!! expensive though.
nYY4nE9Waa	Hello, I use to live in Arizona, but not in the areas you listed. This is the best site to find out about restaurants and anything that is going on in Arizona. I'm sure you can find something here. http://www.azcentral.com/ent/dining/|`|7bQUBYeNaa	Im all about the Cheesecake Factory. But of course it depends on what you want to eat. But the Cheesecake in Scottsdale is super nice. I don't really go to upscale places in Scottsdale. Maybe a sushi place?|`|SqPVrEaCaa	Donovan's Steak and Chop House    great staff  good food!|`|pbV7dnKKaa	I would go to Scottsdale, they seemed to have nicer restaurants when I was there. I looked at an online yellow pages to find places there are to go to depending on what you like to eat! Mardenely's was very nice, its an Italian restaurant with good food and a fancy atmosphere. Happy Valentines Day!|`|3Acalpmhaa	I live in the PHX area, and my fav. restraunt is the cheescake factory.  they're delicious, and reeeeally nice.   GOOD LUCK!!  ~JENNY
empjU5nVaa	There is a denny's grand slam deal.  All you pay for are your drinks.  Everything else is $0.99.

Pay for drinks and stuff  The whole idea behind this was to remind you of dennys and how good it is to sit down and have a well cooked meal rather than go through the drive thru
pumHU9s9aa	It's the "Grand Slam" breakfast. You can get it between 6a.m. and 2 p.m..

sqR0iyuWaa	Their sizes are:  Tall: 12 oz  Grande: 16 oz  Venti: 20 oz    But if you say "small" "medium"  "large", they'll make it, unless that particular employee is a real dick.  A real cafe might have a "short" approx 8 oz, so that's why a tall is a small.  People complain about the size names, but really it's no worse than "biggie" or "jumbo". Definitely not worse than "like it".    Do you know what drinks you like? Same stuff as most other cafes. starbucks.com has a full menu.    Edit:     Okay, I'll give a more complete description. Sorry, I'm kinda into coffee. It's what gives me the energy to talk about coffee!    I assume you want coffee (as opposed to tea or non-caffeinated-dairy-stuff).     Like other cafes, you can get brewed coffee, or espresso-based.     For the former, they'll have a couple varieties. They don't do vanilla or hazelnut, like Dunkin. Your choices are based on origin- where in the world the bean was grown, and roast- light, medium, dark. It's more like the differences among wines. Just ask the barista what he or she recommends.     Espresso-based drinks. These are NOT Starbucks' proprietary drinks. You can get them anywhere.      espresso- little shot of strong coffee (okay, that's an oversimplification)  cappuccino- espresso with seamed milk and milk foam  caffe latte - espresso with steamed milk. Tiny plop of foam on top, but not a full layer of it.   mocha latte- cafe latte with chocolate.   americano- espresso with hot water   frappe- blended with mik/cream substance and ice, like a milkshake.   latte macchiato - mostly steamed milk "marked" with a little espresso.     caffe latte - "latte" for short  mocha latte - "mocha" for short. White chocolate is available too.   they call their frappes "frappuccino". They're seriously like milkshakes. They have a lot on the menu- just look it over when you get there.    macchiato- the only one on their menu has caramel and whip by default.   **Caramel Macchiato is very popular among new coffee drinkers**    To any of these, you can add a shot of flavored simple (sugar) syrup (just say the name of the flavor) and/or whipped cream "whip" for a charge.     Drinks containing milk- 2% is now their default. Whole skim and soy available. Soy is vanilla flavored and a few cents extra.     Flavor shots are "pumped" in. If you want more or less than their standard, tell them "3 pumps vanilla".     There's an order that they like to say things. Mainly to keep it straight in their own mind. No one will think you're dumb if you don't do it. But it's the logical order in which they add stuff to the cup.     Oh, and if you're actually in Seattle, ordering is more complicated because people are more particular. A "dry" cappuccino has more foam, "wet" more liquid.     And seriously, some people specify the temperature in degrees that they want it. No lie. But that is totally NOT mandatory.|`|Uc96X3T3aa	Try a solo expresso the first time. Do not forget to add the milk and sugar. Advance to the dopio afterwards. You will be a PRO.|`|32dc55740bd2edf352af0cb6491223d5aa	you say the size then what you want.  ex. a tall doubble chocolate chip frappichino|`|s3pkflYdaa	well you look at that menu and choose what you like, tell them, and pay for it.  Its really not that hard,|`|oTtH2ENHaa	i usually get a grande carmel machiato|`|n5Mrrf9Gaa	"Yes, can I get a(n)  (any size)  (any drink)."|`|HcLQD1Hbaa	To order you just look at the menu then tell them what drink you want, what size, and any modifications to it you have. I recommend the salted caramel hot chocolate or any of the frappecinos|`|d7769329bd0a2936e9a45b35adc6db88aa	with my mouth|`|pueeMH6gaa	The only thing to remember is that if I am behind you in line don't order some complicated thing that takes the clerk 20 minutes to make. I really hate that.  Just order a coffee and get out of the way.|`|sqPoFZ00aa	I've only been to Starbucks once, and I got a Grande Caramel Frappucino. It was so good. It was really creamy, like a milkshake.|`|J2Y5zx4Saa	Tall-Small  Grande-Medium  Venti-Large    Say what size you want your drink and then order what you'd like. If you go to their website they will have a list of beverages you can choose from. Enjoy but dont get addicted to it haha :)|`|vPlTBQ7kaa	U walk up to the counter...|`|pumHU9s9aa	Much like you would order anywhere else except there are two stations. You order with the cashier and pick up your order at another station just down from the cashier where the barrista will place it when it's ready for you to pick up.  There is a large menu board behind the counter to make things easier.  If you like frozen, order a frappucino.  If you like plain coffee, order the coffee of the day which will be written on a board somewhere.  They usually have a "featured" blend of the day.  They do not have flavored coffees, but you can have flavor additives if you like that sort of thing. A small is a "tall" (which makes NO sense since it's anything BUT tall, about 8 oz.), a medium is a "grande", and a large is a "venti".  They have deserts and cocoa as well.  I recommend a Cafe Americano...it's a regular coffee with a shot of espresso.  Ask for "room" if  you will want to put cream or milk in your coffee.|`|jX4Byb6Eaa	you tell them what you want off of the menu and what size you would like it. i always get a special drink.     a grande (medium) white chocolate mocha (the menu drink) with added raspberry flavor (that's extra) and 2 added shots of espresso (that's 2 added shots of coffee for the caffeine!)     hope that helps. :)  happy coffee drinking!|`|ehfe97Zcaa	Ummmm, you ask for what you want and then pay?     I'm sorry, is there some trick to this question?|`|XK6k2UAIaa	Er honestly IDK I just know that tall means small and grande is medium and venti means large. I love the Carmel Ice Frappachino.  Sorry somehow I miss typed that and didn't put medium.
JfVxCDb7aa	EAT IT  THERE|`|hNa5oHxQaa	gotta eat there.|`|c08708aebaf627e023dde432dde5dc5aaa	You've got to eat it there...|`|7c8b025c5777c0311126dfda9a26ba37aa	and it's one item per person,meaning you can only order for free one serving of hash browns or burger or coffee,anything else is charged at the full price.|`|029366e443f706114f76140b91711233aa	The website says you get a free Grand Slam!  (yeah, it says Dine in only)|`|eH1UKdOqaa	my sausage was raw
