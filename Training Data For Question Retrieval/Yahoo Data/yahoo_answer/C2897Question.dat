20090205181542AA6WwPJ	Environment;Global Warming	If a person profits from "Global Warming", can he still be objective or does science suffer?	If a person makes a profit from "Global Warming", can they be a credible source of information, or do they become a shill for 'Big Environment'?      Even if it's something small like running a blog site or reviewing products for corporations, can they still remain objective, and can they still evaluate data with an open mind?      Or does their business and the strive for profits prevent them from correctly evaluating the science?      Shouldn't those who profit from "Global Warming" be excluded from commenting on the subject?  After all, it's clear that they will do what is needed to protect their profits and will naturally be biased in their views. Right?
20090205175627AAvugJ4	Environment;Global Warming	Do you have issues, to the use of verbatim on GW?	Has anyone else noticed that some people will quote a source without giving it credit? One individual will constantly ask questions mirrored from the real climate web site. Do you think this promotes or discredits YA Q&A format. I hate to nitpick but this was a major problem in college. Isn't it a cheap shot to acclaim creditability without any self endeavor?       http://education.yahoo.com/reference/dic...

20090203071758AAVivZH	Environment;Global Warming	Are Groundhogs As Reliable As Computer Models?	Groundhogs have a track record of 50% when it comes to predicting future climate.      NOAA's Climate Prediction Center predicted that the midwest and Alaska would have a warmer than average winter this year.      Since groundhogs and computers have the same probability of getting predictions correct, shouldn't we be shutting down expensive computers that require lots of energy and produce green house gasses for a few more ecological friendly groundhogs?
20090203070236AAlydPW	Environment;Global Warming	When AGW proponents insist that people will have to change their lifestyles, what do they mean?	I heard an activist saying that on NPR last night.    I'm just not sure what he meant.    Nobody takes a Sunday Drive anymore.    People already generally try to bunch their errands together to save time and money.   Carpooling makes sense only if you live very close to someone who has your exact same schedule both coming and going.   Public transportation is heavily subsidized and very crowded.     It's difficult to bike to and from the grocery store when you're buying for a family of five.    It's mostly families of five driving SUVs and minivans.       So what further changes would be proposed?     Government limits on commutes - on the distance you're allowed to drive to and from work?    What if the limit is 50 miles and the two jobs a couple has are 120 miles apart from each other?    What if one partner loses her job and has to take another one more than 50 miles away?   Why is where you live and work any of the government's business in a country founded by Ben Franklin and Thomas Jefferson anyway?    Just what are these "lifestyle changes?"
