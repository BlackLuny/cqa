20090306164435AAsoZPA	Business & Finance;Taxes;United States	Question about the new cigarette tax?	When is this tax paid?  Is it paid after the final sale to the consumer?  Does the store selling them pay it?  Is it paid by the manufacturer?  I'm wondering because a pack of Newport where I live jumped in one day fro $4.95 to $5.50. If the retailer pays the tax, how can they add the new tax on their existing inventory, which was already taxed and paid for?  I realize that to make it fair the retailer would have to completely sell out their entire inventory before charging the new price, which is unreasonable.  I also know the government isn't "double dipping" because they can't tax items the retailers already paid tax on.  That would make this a huge profit for the retailer because they benefit from being able to charge more tax on cigarettes in their inventory already and keep it. It just seems unfair that the consumer gets the short end of the stick.

20090306235532AAdKqDd	Business & Finance;Other - Business & Finance	Is moving back to California possible?	It is a rather long story but I will summarize. My parents got divorced when I was 12. After the divorce my mom got custody of me and my brothers and sisters. We constantly moved from house to house but staying in the Tacoma area of Washington. However In the summer after my freshmen year of high school she moved us down to Thousand Oaks, California. I was pissed at the time but then I made a lot of friends. After one year of community college my mom told us that we were going to have to move again and that she was going to Arizona with the kids and if I wanted to come I would have to work and cosign with her for her house. My other option was to move back to Washington to live with my dad for a year while I figured things out. He has been letting me live here for free.       This is my dilemma: All of my friends from High School are in California. I never got to hold on to any lasting relationships growing up and I don't want to lose these.      If I do not move back before the start of fall semester I will lose my residency. This would make college way too expensive and I would be stuck in Washington until I got my bachelors.      Is it at all possible for me to find a part time job in California? Finding a room to rent should not be hard as many people are renting out to help pay the bills. I really want to move back but I am very concerned about the unemployment rate there.       Has anyone done this in the last few months? If not does it seem possible in this economy?

Then what to do with all the contents ?      My Sister is happily married with three kids in a nearby town   On a bit of a mortgage, but no major financial worries      Rent the whole property out and we both stay put as we are is another one      Any other notions ?

20090307140941AAVvb2x	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	Should I get a lawyer and fight this?	I moved out apt because of the tenants that lived beside me were harassing me by banging on the wall all the time with the hammer at times. They also cursed at me. Anyways, I am on time with rent. The real estate lady told me that I have to pay rent until someone moves in, but someone told me that I am able to get out the lease and the landlord would owe me most of my rent money for not doing anything about what his other tenants were doing to me. He knew about it because I wrote letters and he wanted me to move, but he never offered to pay for me to move. The landlord has everyone on his side. so if I get a lawyer would I win?

The revenue for my business will go into PayPal, before being transferred to my business bank account. However, I also want to use some of that revenue in PayPal to pay for business expenses, due to convenience.

I have a credit card that one of their affiliates attached a "credit card protection plan" to my monthly statement without my permission. This credit card is paid through my accounting department and the protection charge was not noticed for six months.      When it was discovered, I called the number listed for the protection plan and cancelled the service and asked for a full refund. I was told they could give me a courtesy refund of three months. I refused this and demaned my full refund. I was told I had approved this protection plan via telephone. This I know is not true because I never enroll in any plans like this.      What would be the best approached in getting my money back from these people. Is there a government agency overlooking credit cards that I can complain to? Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Here's the info on it.      We are pre-approved for a loan amount of $350,000.  The home we like is a short-sale and the bank has already approved the short-sale.  They are asking $240,000 and compared to the other homes in our area we believe it is worth $290,000 to us.  We really want the home and don't want to lose our chance so we are going to offer $275,000 and the bank pays the closing costs.  We are trying to do anything we can to avoide paying the closing costs ourselves because we might have a hard time coming up with it.  However, we are willing to offer $35,000 on top of their asking price.  Well actually, think of it more as $25,000 more because if the bank does pay the closing costs then we are really only giving them $25,000 more and not $35,000 more.      Do you think we will have a great chance to get it at an offer of $275,000 and they pay closing OR do you think we need to offer $275,000 and NOT ask for closing?      Our agent says we might not get a chance to submit a backup offer because this home already has multiple bids and that the banks are taking the first best offer these days (in our area of Fullerton, CA).      Please help because I am making the offer today at 3pm.

20090307114118AAh9aLC	Business & Finance;Investing	Are as Christians wrong if they invest their saving into mutual fund investment?	Since the world economy collapsed and the stocks declined/shrinked cruely (!!!smile!!! as a christian we have to be joyful in any circumtances, right smile!!!!), at churches many pastors preached about not investing money on investment field, it's GREEDY, the economy got worse etc etc (they preached after about on Nov 2008).       When I heard about it, I just feel guilty, but I invested it for the LONG TERM PURPOSE, when it was inclined very high, I didnt sell it, because it's just for investment (not doing such as buy when low and sell when high), before I invested I prayed too and after that stocks down, I asked God whether I was wrong or not?.  Some believers say that we have to be wise to manage the money to INVEST it such as buy property, buy valuable goods and so on and so on.      My other sister in Christ has the same feeling and she said that she had been sinful to join it and it sounds so misserable. I have encouraged her, but I will find more information regarding this.      I tried to find out the information about it, I found there is an investment web for the christians, but it's not too clear unless we join their web.      Would you please share about the above issue? Thank you. God bless you.

So, I regret to say that....but Bachellier, Scholes, Black and many others were wrong.       Happy trading though.

I will say at the interview the boss seems a bit demanding and short.  I was hired into this company under what they called a trial basis, 90 days then a decision, which to see if i worked out. He stated he was very strict about work quality. This may i add is a company run by the owner and HR is the wife.     The company seems to be a very stressful place with everyone.  There was a no talking policy, so i withdrew to myself and avoid the write ups for talking (being i witnessed others in trouble) and the place literally was run like a library.    From the beginning I had the feeling this guy didn't have very good personal relations and even a co-worker stated his wife saying this.    As i continued to work here, my work quality was good.  I got along with others (when i could talk to them) but still no communication with the boss.     One day the lead was teaching me a job, which in the end results I found to be wrong.  I had done the whole job wrong.  The boss cursed furious when he found out.  It was so bad I cried. He was screaming at me "why did this happen, how did you do this?" and when i tried to explain he screamed right over me.  Within the next few days he once referred to me as "VonMunster" in front of the lead person. I ask are you calling me a name?  He says "No, my issue just slap me around a bit".  I choose to ignore this but i believed he didnt like me for some reason.   That was the only incident that i am aware of that was a problem.  After my 90 days and 2 weeks I ask HR about the temp and if i would go perm.  The next day i was called to a meeting with this boss and he presumed to tell me the we (he and I) didnt see eye to eye. Personality conflict. Extending my 90 days to another 90 days. OK this is the first I knew of it!  We never really had much communication at all.    Next day I'm in HR signing papers explaining the first and the next 90 days as being trial periods. I had ask HR what she thought the problem was and we discussed it a bit. I left the office with the notion that she said she'd have a talk with him.    Monday morning Fired!  Due to he says i said some thing to her that was upsetting.   When I ask what,  no explanation.    So now I'm unemployed again.    Do you think this is an unemployment case?  WHAT AN A**HOLE!!

20090307132556AAhdZGv	Business & Finance;Taxes;United States	Can't get cost basis info from broker. What do we do?	My husband received 100 shares of stock as a gift in 1986. After many years of dividend reinvestment and one stock split, we sold some of it. We only sold the portion purchased through re-investment (those were "book shares" and the original stock was "certificate shares" so we know we didn't sell any of the original gift).       The broker is BNY Mellon. They won't provide cost basis information before 1992. So we have 6 years of stock purchase through dividend re-investment where we can't find the cost basis.       It's only one stock, not a mutual fund. I can find the price the shares on each dividend-reinvestment day - but I would also need to know the dividend amount so I can figure out how many shares were actually purchased with each quarters' reinvestment.       Basically, I need to get the dividend history for the company in which he owns the stock between 1986 and 1992. It's not on the company's website.      Help! We're about to get stuck with a *giant* tax bill if we can't reconstruct the cost basis info!

Hello,   I went to file my taxes and i need to request an ITIN for my wife as she is in the process of getting her Residency and SSN. (She entered using a k1 visa and the case is pending) The thing is, the person filing my taxes tells me an ITIN does not give me as much credit as if she had a SSN. For example, if she had a SSN using turbo tax i'm supposed to get 3500 from federal and 2400 from the state. However, when he made my taxes he tells me that i would get 2400 federal and a total of 3500. Is this correct? In my view she is a dependent, why would an ITIN give me less of my money back??   Any input would be appreciated.

My daughter was born 12/30/08. She lives with my boyfriend and I. He's 23, lived in IL with me all of '08 before moving to KY for the summer and lives back in IL now. He has made more so he is going to claim her and get that EITC credit if he can. Is there anything I can claim at all? And how exactly do I file my taxes? I'm planning on using the e-file on the IRS website. Also, do I have to file 2 state returns for IL and KY or how does having lived in 2 states in '08 work? Thanks.

Which I have used and pay on time for the past few years.  Sometimes the balance goes up and sometimes I zero it out.  In general I feel I am a good customer with a good credit score, but the last year I have had some hardships - divorce, layoff, economy, etc. and my balances have gone up.  I am still paying the minimums plus some and my accounts are current however I am one of the many people being victimized by these companies, reducing my credit lines to what I owe, skyrocketing my interest rates for no reason - and basically killing my FICO.  Fine.  I can deal,  I racked up the debt, I'll pay it off... but now I'm wondering.  If they are going to kill my credit anyways - why should I pay them at all?  They way they've been treating me I'd never use them again once I paid them off anyways.  And how long before they tank - can't they just take my debt with them?

Here is the scenario:  Our student loans = 70k, and we have 5k for a down payment (not much when looking at a 250-300k home).   The interest on our student loans is SUPER LOW (2.5 to 3.5%), and the mortgage we'd likely get is between 4 to 5% (so higher than our student loans).

20090307145013AAxsZGS	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	Rental dispute in MA...Help!?	Hi, I just moved into a new house that I bought and I am having a rental dispute with my previous landlord.  I was wondering if I could get some advice on this.  This is how a portion of my rental contract reads:      TERM: The tenancy shall be on an at will, month to month basis except that the tenant and landlord agree that neither shall terminate the tenancy between Sept. 1 and Feb. 2 of the following year.  The terms repeat every year and apply for as long as the tenant stays in the apartment. (Please note: This means that you agree not to move during the winter months of Oct., Nov., Dec., Jan., Feb., or Mar., of any year.)       Now, here is my issue.  I lived in the apartment for two years and three months.  I gave my notice January 15th and moved out January 23rd. I know that I moved during a month that I agreed not to move however, this is how I feel: the rental agreement was not drawn up by a lawyer and contains numerous grammatical errors.  My previous landlord is charging me for one month's rent and 150.00 to damage to the unit below me for an over-flowed shower.  I have no idea what that is all about.  All I got was a bill for the repair. According to MA law, the landlord must provide the lessee with a valid rental agreement.        Is this a valid rental agreement the way it is written???      Thanks for your help!

20090307144330AAyb43e	Business & Finance;Taxes;Other - Taxes	Got taxed on inheritance?	Bit of a problem.  When my father died in 1995 my brother and I inherited some property that he owned.  This property was sold sometime in the late nineties and the proceeds sat in the estate account until 2002 when it was withdrawn and invested.  The total invested was about $22,000.  Over the course of the next three years, (2003,2004,2005) I began cashing out this money to pay for living expenses while I attended school.  By the beginning of 2006, the value had increased by $8000, but the money was all gone.  So a total of $30,000 had been liquidated over 3 years.  The investment firm was sending me 1099-Ds each year but I never actually filled out or submitted any tax documents (irresponsible, I know  -- I was young and stupid) -:) -- The problem now, is that the IRS has sent me a notice that I owe about $5500 total in taxes from 2003,2004,2005 not reported by me, but still reported by the investment firm.  The money was the result of inheritance but that was not known to anyone but me because I never filled out any 1040s or 1099s for those years.  When I first started receiving the notices, I panicked and decided the best thing to do was set up a payment plan.  They made me fill out and return all the old 1040s from those years, which I did at the end of 2008 and they've all been accepted, so all my documents are "current" now.      My question is, now that I realize they taxed me on my inheritance, is there anything I can do??  I've already paid $1,400.  Is there any way to *not* have to pay this at this point and also get my $1400 back?  I don't have money for a tax lawyer or expensive tax pro.  I'm thinking the best thing to do is to *stop* doing my own paperwork possibly go talk to the local taxpayer advocate.      Any ideas?  Am I correct that this money should not have been taxable, and probably wouldn't have been if I'd done the 1099s and reported the inheritance back when I got them in 2003,2004,2005?      Thanks!

I have decided not to replace the cabinets, but rather use the space as a closet for storage.  Here is the problem, the closet costs a lot less at 1400 (including taxes, overhead & profit), but the renovations company only wants to give me a refund on the difference of the estimate of 2100 (give me a refund of 700) and keep the 400 balance saying it is for their overhead, profit and taxes.  ]      Can they do this?
