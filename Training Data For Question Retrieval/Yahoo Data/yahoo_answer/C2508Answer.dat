AA10729675	He made schooling for children a law.  He created public schools in France.    He allowed divorce.  He changed the code of Laws, aligning it with the Justinian Code of Laws with of course some changes.  He changed the calendar, and abolished the horrible revolution calendar.  He created the Bank of France.  Those are mere examples of all his reforms achievements.|`|NYU37jfGaa	Napoleon kept some of the reforms made during the Revolution.  He endorsed the Revolutionary land settlement involving the sale of Church l ands, which gave all peasant and bourgoise purchasers a vested interest in supporting the regime.  Financial stability was helped too, by the foundation of the Bank of France in 1803.  The tax system was simplified and made more efficient along lines sketched out in the 1790s.  The administrative reforms of the revolutionary decade were also maintained, though in an authoritarian twist in 1800 each department was endowed with a Napoleonic nominee, the prefect.  Within their constituencies they acted as petty emperors to ensure the imperial will was carried out.    This reinforcement of the principle of authority was mirrored int he field of liberal freedoms; imprisonment without trial was introduced, overriding habeus corpus provisions.  Napoleon reimposed strict censorship, which also recalled the ancien regime.  Once the herald of Revolutionary politics, the newspaper no longer had a place in the hierarchical and repressive world of the First Empire; over a thousand new titles and happeared in the decade after 1789, by 1811 only four had full government authorization.    This blend of REvolutionary rationalism and authoritarian principle was epitomized in the famous code Napoleon of 1804.  Equality before the law and the "career open to talents" were preserved, but one could detect the hierarchical hand of Napoleon in the way in which the family was made the base unit of social organization.  The code reduced women's status to that of minors.  Imprisonment without trial was used to incarcerate errant wives, daughters, and other family members.  Family law in the Revolutionary decade had been made egalitarina and gender-blind; under Napoleon daughters; rights were systematically diminished.  Rather generous welfare provisions for war-widows, the aged and even unmaried motehrs were brought to an end.  The liberal divorce laws of the 1790s, which had provided battered and abandoned wives with a means of improving their legal position were altered in ways which disadvantaged women.  Provision for female education was in poorer shape in 1815 than it had been in 1789, it was almost wholly under the church, since the state concerned itself only with the education of boys.  The lycees, founded by Napoleon for secondary schooling, aimed essentially at reproducing a male social and bureaucratic elite.|`|AA11010672	The only one i know for sure was the change from Ft And inches to Metric , but Ithink was then that their currency was decimalise and the distance measurement was changed to kilo meters metric with the weights also going to kilos and grams.

AA12343309	Any name can be Jewish.  There are very few exclusively Jewish names.  A lot of names in the U.S. are identified as Jewish as a large portion of immigrants with certain names were Jewish while back in their country of origin the same name was used by Jews and non Jews.  For instance names ending in "stein" "berg" "burg" "ski" "sky" etc are not necessarily Jewish.    Also the 3 branches of Judaism do not define a Jew the same way.    Reform Jews define a Jew by the religion alone.    Orthodox and Conservative Jews define the Jew by the mother alone, not the father or necessarily the religion.  They state if person does not have a Jewish mother the only way they can be Jewish is to convert to Judaism.  While they are Jewish if they have a Jewish mother, even though they have renounced their Jewish faith.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashkenazi_J...|`|0HAn67yZaa	lambert Name Meaning and History  English, French, Dutch, and German: from a Germanic personal name composed of the elements land land, territory + berht bright, famous.

Lambert Name Meaning and History  English, French, Dutch, and German: from a Germanic personal name composed of the elements land "land", "territory" + berht "bright", "famous". In England, the native Old English form  "Landbeorht" was replaced by Lambert, the Continental form of the name that was taken to England by the Normans from France. The name gained wider currency in Britain in the Middle Ages with the immigration of weavers from Flanders, among whom St. Lambert or Lamprecht, bishop of Maastricht in around 700, was a popular cult figure. In Italy the name was popularized in the Middle Ages as a result of the fame of Lambert I and II, Dukes of Spoleto and Holy Roman Emperors.     http://www.surnamedb.com/surname.aspx?na...    Recorded in over forty spelling forms from Lambert, Lambard and Limprecht, to Lambrich, Lambertini and Lemmens, this surname is almost certainly of very early German origins. As a surname it started life in the 12th century, but the derivation is from a pre 5th century personal name. This was 'Landbehrt', composed of the elements "land", meaning territory, and "berht", bright, and while the meaning may have been "Bright land", it may not have had a meaning at all! Nevertheless, it is one of a group of 'made up' names, apparently extolling the virtues of land ownership, and territorial possession. Whether this was fact or wishful thinking, is not proven. What is known is that St. Lambert, Bishop of Maastricht in about the year 700 a.d, was highly venerated, and a source of the name's popularity. Examples of the early recordings include Gozelinus filius Lamberti of Yorkshire, England,in the famous Domesday Book of 1086, but clearly this name was not hereditary in the sense we know it today, nor was that of Tiddemus filius Lamberti of Hamburg in 1262. Another source of the name can be the Olde English 'Lambhierd', representing the occupation of lamb-herd, the first recorded namebearer being William Lambhyrde, in the 1255 Assize Court Rolls of Essex. Charles Lambert, aged 23 yrs., was an early settler in the New World Colonies, leaving London on the "Expedition" bound for the Barbadoes, in November 1635. The first recorded spelling of the family name anywhere in the world is believed to be that of Richard Lambert, which was dated 1148, in the 'Pipe Rolls' of Hampshire. This was during the reign of King Stephen of England, known as "Count of Blois", 1135 - 1154.     http://www.familysearch.org  has these varied spellings:   LUMBERT ; LOMBARD; LAMBERD; LAMBARTH; LAMBARD ; LAMBETH ; DE LAMBINET; DE LAMBERTYE ;   LAMBERTSEN; LAMBERTSSON ; LAMBERTSDR.; LAMBERTI ; LAMPERT ; LAMPARTNER; LAMPERTZ; LAMPARTER ; LEMBERT ; LAMBERTS ; LAMBRIGTSEN ;  LAMBRETSEN ; LAMBERTSDATTER; DE LAMBERTE; LAMBERTSENS ; L' LAMBERT;  & LAMBRECHTSDATTER.       The earliest listings I saw were (Lantbertus) Lambert II --  Birth: 650 AD; Death: 741 AD; he was married abt 0695.   His grandfather was Lambert I (Lanterbertus)--b.  abt 605 AD, d. aft 650 AD. (his line goes back to Soissons Chlothar I "The Old" B:  abt 497 AD, Rheims, Marne, France , D:  25 Nov 561 AD,Braines, Lorraine, France and Ingund (Ingolde) Thuringian , B. 500 AD in Thuringia, Germany)

Common Sense is like street smarts.  Don't talk to strangers, look both ways before crossing the street, think about what you say before you say it, don't touch a hot stove.    You can have have Book Sense, but then be completely oblivious to everything else and have no Common Sense.    You can argue that either one is the "better" one to have.  To get into a good college and get a good job, you'll need Book Sense.  But Common Sense helps you survive on a day-to-day basis.  Therefore, you want to have ample amounts of both Common and Book Sense.|`|HkXYGAOdaa	common sense, definitely.

7VpDEkC6aa	Um, not really.  It's not really a Gibson guitar.  Gibson sponsors that company, but it is NOT a Gibson in any way. The cheapest REAL Gibson is $950.    Besides you are looking at the wrong type of guitar for "Mexican" related music.  I saw one video by  Los Cuates de Sinaloa...If that's what you're talking..kinda like Mariachi music..then you need  a classical guitar with nylon strings:  check out these:  http://www.amazon.com/s/qid=1233179033/r...    any one of those is what you are looking for.      You don't want a steel string acoustic. Or "Acoustic" guitar.  Mexican music doesn't really use them.    Since you are just starting out, one of those would be appropriate for learning on. Classical guitars are a lot less dependent on being "good"  to be easy to play.    A Steel String guitar can be messed up to play if you don't get a really good one.    I learned on a cheap *** classical guitar when I was a little kid. I still played that guitar until I was about 20yrs old or more(along with my electric guitars). It still played OK even though it probably only cost about $25     You want a "classical" guitar. Trust me!|`|oweQc1OBaa	that would be good. although i wouldn't recommend getting a guitar from best buy. and mastero is made by gibson, it is not a real gibson. i would recommend epiphone, it is also made by gibson, i love epiphone.   guitars i would recommend:  http://www.guitarcenter.com/Epiphone-AJ-...  http://www.guitarcenter.com/Epiphone-PR-...  http://www.guitarcenter.com/Epiphone-DR-...  they have them in different colors. i have the second one, had it for almost four or five years, still great. good luck!|`|AA10196574	Norman makes a great model for acoustic. they are Canadian made with maple. and they sound amazing.|`|lUe4rReZaa	I'm going to ditto russel on this one.   If you are playing Mexican music, a good nylon string classical guitar is what you want.   Don't buy an instrument from Best Buy, Walmart, or Target, they are very cheaply made, even with the fancy brand name on them.    Here is a good place to start looking for guitars brands and prices,    http://guitars.musiciansfriend.com/navig...    If your budget allows I'd start in the $200 and up range. but even the $100 ones here are better than that Maestro.  If you buy a used guitar, you can get more bang for your buck.    Go and play as many different guitars as you can find.  Tell the folks in the music shop that you are a beginner and what kind of music you are interested in, and they can help you find a good guitar.

That's a weird combination.....    any way,  I don't think it matters with single coil pickups, just pop it it the middle and mount it at the same height as the original. That should be fine.    And Metal shouldn't need the combo of the two pickups. Metal is usually done with humbuckers at the bridge. Although if you do use the combo, it's better to have a high gain like a hot rail in the middle rather that a weaker single coil.      I think it's better to always have comparable gain levels for your pickups. If one pickup is higher gain than the others, you'll have to mess around with your amp settings all the time.    For instance, I have an Epiphone doubleneck (pictured) and a strat.  The Epi has humbuckers, the Strat doesn't.   I have to change every setting on my amp AND the volume to get similar sounds from each guitar at the same sound level.]    So I'd recommend just changing your middle pickup first and see how it goes.
3258fd9ca0baa8e13a1a5449e7bdca00aa	Nope.  The sonnet form has its origins in Italy in the 1200s, 300-some years before Shakespeare.    Shakespeare wasn't even the one responsible for introducing the sonnet form to England - that credit belongs to Sir Thomas Wyatt, in the early 1500s.  Shakespeare was, however, one of the most prolific sonnet writers, so in modern times the sonnet is very closely associated with Shakespeare.|`|xJoMSkI5aa	No. There are lots of different ways to write a sonnet, which is basically a kind of short poem. Shakespeare's sonnets have a very specific form, though, and scholars have named that form the "Shakespearean sonnet" after the great bard. These kinds of sonnets have several things in common.    From Shmoop Poetry|`|R02aazVdaa	Of course not, though he is one of the best-known sonnet writers, and wrote 154 of them. It was used during the Thirteenth century, before his time.|`|mbXHkf1maa	No.  The earliest date from the 13th century in Italy. See the Sonnet article at Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonnet|`|uX09rPGlaa	Petrarch was the first person to use the italian form of sonnets in the 1300's. Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey and Sir Thomas Wyatt invented the English Sonnet which was then used by Shakespeare.|`|ceBTTCPwaa	The sonnet is the only poetic form that can be found in lyric poetry from Europe. The term "sonnet" derives from the Occitan word sonet and the Italian word sonetto, both meaning "little song".    The Italian sonnet was created by Giacomo da Lentini, head of the Sicilian School under Frederick II.Guittone d'Arezzo rediscovered it and brought it to Tuscany where he adapted it to his language when he founded the Neo-Sicilian School (12351294). He wrote almost 300 sonnets. Other Italian poets of the time, including Dante Alighieri (12651321) and Guido Cavalcanti (c. 12501300) wrote sonnets, but the most famous early sonneteer was Petrarca (known in English as Petrarch). Other fine examples were written by Michelangelo.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonnet  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Wyat...  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petrarchan  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Howar...

GqQFu9Qpaa	This is a great example of a villanelle.    You responded to the form in both a respectful and playful way.    In writing a villanelle though there can be some stretching and tweaking of both the iambic pentameter line, and the refrain lines if you like.      See     One Art     by Elizabeth Bishop        Please keep up the good work.|`|dS3XHvaoaa	It is right write for him... I like your poem...|`|4ieW81HHaa	Listen to the editor lady.     (Very strong effort with the form, though.)|`|wWL934E8aa	I think this one is a grand slam.  He needs to learn what the words mean.  My son used 'show some respect' when he was like 14 years old.  He outgrew that and realized he wasn't showing respect and therefore didn't earn any.    Respect is given but also you earn it as well.  Someone with age is assumed to have earned respect from those younger.    Sorry, I sha'nt go on.  You have spoken lovely on the topic!|`|n9hRyHpqaa	I think you did.

And MUCH better than my poem "Ode to Show Some Respect." Did you read it? lol I tried. You succeeded.|`|j37DL7WLaa	I agree, Villanelles are tough to make coherent.  This is a good one and I hope the one to whom you are addressing will see it; on the other hand, it seems he enjoys any kind of attention, even negative attention!     Good poem!|`|1wOBfgZIaa	Stop feeding the sharks.

If you want to be Barack Obama though, you had better not be an idealist. Obama knows he has to sell his soul to get anything done in DC and he is hitting the pavement checking out the offers for his ***. He is cynical enough to know you can sell your asterisk to 50 different clients and come out clean because you can't POSSIBLY DELIVER in 50 directions at once.    Idealism has it's place, but I in politics one has to be a cynical schemer.

When you are on your death bed, do you want to have regrets that all you ever did was stuff to make your own selfish life more bearable?    I suggest you read about how the holocaust survivors managed to make it through without thinking only of themselves. As part of the wealthiest humans on earth, I believe that you have a moral imperative to see how you can help a large proportion of humanity who are starving as we chat on Yahoo Answers.    You might want to learn how US and UK foreign policy has contributed to starvation in the world. It's surprising. Check out the book "Failed States" by Noam Chomsky for a real eye opener.|`|279ac5587c0a982b23b03bde3f0bbf91aa	It is good and possible. The motivation is centered in self not self centered. If you love your self it is due to accepting yourself as you are. When you do this  you can love and accept others as they are.   It then is in your best interest to try to make it a better world. Helping others helps you.   Plant a tree, smile at a stranger, open a door for someone and you make the world a better place to live.|`|010478ea090db9976afeb8170939dea9aa	before you try to make the world a better place, you must be able to define/pinpoint what would make the world a better place. to simply want to make the world a better place is not nearly enough, you must develop some idea in how to do so, or the world will continue as it is with no effect from your actions.    also there is a limit to what one can do to make the world a better place, it is hard to change in the world in one lifetime.

3gstu3nTaa	I actually just finished it today for the second time. Basically, Simon is a vampire and Zoe is a high school girl who's mom is dying of cancer. They meet, and while Zoe thinks that Simon is just a creep at first, they slowly get to know each other, and Simon tells Zoe his story.   He was born in England in the 1650's. His older brother, Christopher, is kipnapped by their father's business partner, who was secretly a vampire. The man turns Christopher into a vampire while the boy is still very young, and his family is unamware of his fate. One night, while Simon was still young, Christopher returns to their home and lures their mother out into the night, where he kills her. Years later, when Simon is about 17, he runs into Christopher and he turns Simon in to a vampire. Simon escapes, and vows to spend the rest of his years searching for Christopher, and when he finds him he will kill him to avenge his mother's death.   After hearing this story, Zoe believes Simon, and they begin to grow closer. Simon and Zoe feel that they have a unigue connection, because Simon's mother is dead and Zoe's mother is dying. They feel that they are the only ones who really understand each other, and this brings them closer. Eventually, Zoe decides to help Simon kill Christopher, as Simon now knows that Christopher has been adotped by a family in their town, telling his new parents that he is an orphaned albino boy. Christopher has secretly been the cause of greusome murders in the town, and that's how Simon knows he is their.   Simon and Zoe's plan is simple: Simon digs a hole in a park in their town, places upward-facing wooden stakes at the bottom, and covers the hole with a blanket and disquises it with leaves. The next night, Zoe will lure the unsuspecting Christopher into the park, where he will hopefully fall into the hole and be impailed and die. When the plan is carried out, there are some complications, and for a time it seems hopeless. Simon and Christopher ultimately end up fighting each other (not part of the plan), but in the end Christopher falls into the hole and dies. Simon tells Zoe to leave him there, that he will come to her in a few nights, and Zoe goes home shaken and disturbed.   The next night, Zoe has a sleepover with Lorraine for the last time before Lorraine moves to Oregon. She is sad to see her freind go, but she realizes that thier bond is too strong to ever break. Although the book never tells you for sure whether or not Zoe's mother dies, Zoe ultimately comes to terms with her mother's inevitable death. That night, Zoe meets Simon at the park, where he tells her that he has nothing to live for now that he has fulfilled his revenge, and he can't live with the thought that he had killed his brother, no matter how evil Christoher was. He does love Zoe, but he can't bear the fact that he will only know her for a short time compared to his immortal life. Hates that he would spend more time missing her than he did loving her, so he'd rather just cherish the time they had. Despite her protests, Zoe knows this is the best for him, although she will miss him terribly. Together the wait in the park until sunrise, at which point Simon peacefully fades away. Before he disappears completely, the last words he whispers are "I love you, Zoe."    This really is a great book, and it's one of my favorites. You really should try to find the time to read it. It's worth it.

k5OQQt2vaa	First I have to say "emo" is a stereotype and an annoying one at that.      About your poem, I actually liked, it was good. Some constructive criticism that you of course do not have to heed:    All the periods are pretty distracting from the actual words and are at places they shouldn`t be. Example: "Bended with reality." is a dependent clause, in other words it isn`t a full sentence.    "Forget" shouldn`t be capitalized on the third line.    Separate the poem into stanzas, for better effect.    "So afraid, so scared." might work better on the fifth line.    Try to desribe you five senses more, to make the reader understand you better (ie: what your smell, feel, hear, taste(?), etc.).    The ending isn`t very strong; it should have a twist and surprise the reader, to keep it interesting. (Also, "eternally" and "forever are synonyms so it`s a bad idea to use them so close to eachother.)    Lastly, make it longer and try to use full sentences!!! You have talent and with practice I`m sure you`ll write more great peoms!|`|1xcfGHCNaa	I like it. but the last two lines: i am eternally, lost forever.. eternal pretty much means forever.  but its good :)|`|G4YW5is5aa	hi, Im not emo are you?

3258fd9ca0baa8e13a1a5449e7bdca00aa	You don't say how old you are, but the average adult height for women is around five-foot-five.  If you're an adult (or nearly there), that means that you are shorter than average.    For basketball, they have you playing guard because guards don't need to be tall - they need to be good at dribbling and passing so they can get the ball to the forwards under the basket for an easy shot.  Forwards need to be tall so they can jump for rebounds, take easy layup shots, outreach the other team's players for the ball, and so on.      Also, It also helps you as a guard if you're good at long-distance shooting, so you can take a shot yourself if you can't get the ball to the forwards.  Practice your long shots and your free throws!|`|j7D3Sazraa	How old are you? Because 5'1 for like a 6 year old is pretty tall... But you're probably not 6 years old. Don't listen to what others say.

People get provoked when their image is tainted in one way or another.
oa3VMgcWaa	I might add a couple of things, not that the other answers aren't perfect.      Okay you hear about the cattle call, you research what the film might be about, you decide it's for you.  I agree, get there a little early rather than later (the casting associates are usually pretty exhausted by the end of it).   If you can find out something about the scene or the film find something to wear that might lead them to think you belong in the scene, if the grapevine says that they're casting extras for a wedding scene in a church, dress up a little bit  please don't show up in a holey t-shirt and shorts, (actually unless they specifically ask for it I'd stay away from the shorts and t-shirt for the most part) take your resume but don't force it on anyone, bring your own pen and have your ID with you.  Best thing to take you with is a good attitude, visit quietly with people, smile a lot and be pleasant, thank everyone that helps you.  Not that they'll necessarily remember you if you're pleasant, but if you're rude and complain about how long it's taking they will remember you in a bad way and not want anything to do with you (by the way I play thugs and rednecks a lot, I save the being a jerk attitude for when the cameras are rolling).  --- Good luck.|`|w9kWFe61aa	nothing. !!  unless your under18, then a parent.  hope i helped.   good luck |`|Mig6O93Naa	You show up at the assigned place a bit early.

b04fbfe80726bc268d8ec0b353456b51aa	I would say the link is education, and people thinking independently for themselves.  The renaissance was the rebirth of ancient Greek culture - people were suddenly exposed to all that, it enriched European culture, brought about a lot of education, which obviously caused a lot of thinking.  Once people got thinking, the reformation was inevitable.  Exploration was:  1) a consequence of increased education and thinking - wanting, for instance, to prove one's theories (Columbus)  2) a consequence of the Reformation and the various radically reformed groups, because there was persecution of different movements in Europe.  The Moravians travelled around and eventually settled in Georgia. A Puritan group sailed in the Mayflower. Catholics from end settled in Maryland. Quakers and others settled in Pennsylvania. Mennonites spread out all over the world (North and South America, Africa I think, and the islands).  In every case they were escaping some form of persecution, or at least lack of full freedom.  On the other hand, both exploration and the Reformation obviously contributed to increased education and culture, thus coming full circle.|`|b0o2yS0Baa	exploration brought all the known world closer together by trade, and brought in new land (Americas)    renaissance was the product of a wealth of new ideas, by trade and patronage of the arts    reformation was a result of immorality in the Catholic Church (which was cleaned up and now there is nothing like that in the Church) and most likely caused by the printing press invented in the renaissance which made Luther's 95 Thesis wide spread enough for the church to excommunicate him and he started a new Church (Lutheran)|`|3EnzBXaiaa	They were all periods of change  renaissance was a time of focus on the individual (rather than God)   reformation was the questioning of the Catholic church's seling of indulgences (which was shown to everyone by the 95 theses' by Martin Luther) *not martin luther king tho lol*  Exploration was a time of exploring something new that put us where we are today. In search of Gold Glory and God.  The renaisance didn't lead to exploration, the timeline goes Renaissance, Reformation, and Exploration

L82vK2SRaa	Here are some good tips that I found online.  I would also suggest that you stretch to improve your flexibility.  If the flexibility isn't there than you won't be able to achieve the optimal leap, not to mention it could cause injury.      Good Luck    1. Plie Deeper    A deep plie is important for achieving the height you need to properly execute a leap. A plie is simply a deep knee bend, and the last step you do before leaving the ground. The deeper the plie, the more power you will have in your legs to push off. No matter how many steps you take to prepare for the leap, make sure to really bend your knees to get as much power as you need to get high into the air.    2. Look Up    Be sure to look up as you go into your leap. If you look up, the rest of your body will follow. Looking down will keep you low to the ground. As you approach your leap, fixate on a high spot in the distance. Aim to reach that spot...your body will strive to meet the goals you set, so set your goals high. Looking up will not only allow you to jump higher, but will also make for a prettier leap.    3. Control the Landing    What goes up must come down, so landing cannot be avoided. A leap is not complete until it is landed safely. Once again, a deep plie will be helpful. Your goal for the landing will be to hit the floor as softly, and queitly, as possible. Never come out of a leap with straight knees, as doing so will almost always cause an injury. You should begin thinking about your landing as soon as your feet leave the ground. Mentally preparing your legs to absorb your weight will really make a difference.
JOwiKhRBaa	whenever you leap make sure your toes are pointed and your legs are compleatly strait. and in the side leap try to sit in it and turn your legs so your knee caps are facing the celling. the switch leap dont bring the leg that switches up to high becuase then it will be harder to bring it back, also try to push the back leg up after you switch. i hope you make your team!|`|a83a4b5cf4bbb7d5d4e93d3fc1c6cb32aa	okay! well.. lets say you are doing your right leap...  * your left leg right before you leap you need to push with your left leg as hard as you can. it will help you get higher and will make your legs straighter. also practice your leaps everyday until the tryout! hope this helps! and good luck!!!(:|`|s8irnNDYaa	use ur plie, the deeper the plie the more height u get. Make sure u look up, if u look up the rest of ur body will follow. also control ur landing

ZmdIlkpQaa	It was a political decision.      While fighting in North Africa was still going on, after the "Torch" invasion, it became clear to the British leadership than while they were senior, in terms of combat experience, it would be the Americans who supplied the vast bulk of the manpower, airpower and firepower of the Western Allies from that point on.  As such, the Americans naturally would want at least parity in the command structure.  Because it is very important in any military structure to have a single man at the top, Churchill and others faced the fact that the top man was going to have to be an American.  Marshall was Roosevelt's choice, but the British complained some, and Marshall was also doing a fine and critical job as the Army's Chief of Staff, tasked with building the Army and allocating resources.Eisenhower was a fairly popular choice.  He was diplomatic, unassuming and easy to work with, and not given to the self-aggrandizement of Monty, or the temper tantrums of Patton.  He'd shown that he could work well with the British in the Desert, and that he was adroit enough not to be captured or pushed around too much by his subordinates.    Personally, and again considering the massive shift in terms of who was shouldering the burden of the war, I think Ike was a most admirable choice.|`|ZDrXFS2daa	Eisenhower's close professional relationship with the Chief of Staff continued after he moved to London. The new theater commander continued to look at problems as he believed Marshall would see them, and he solved them in accordance with his understanding of the Chief of Staffs policies. That was fortunate, because the grand alliance against the Axis was in large part Marshall's conception; the Supreme Allied Command in Europe was the direct result of his drive and determination; and the essential Allied strategy was the product of his imagination. Where policy was concerned, Marshall's was the guiding hand. Eisenhower was perfectly attuned to his chiefs ideas, and was the ideal officer to translate Marshall's grand strategy into practice.     Read the whole article at the site below to get a better understanding.|`|9233401496ab10d52d1644174696a803aa	George Marshall was the obvious choice and most thought he would be chosen. But, FDR told him and others that Marshall could not be spared as he was doing a brilliant job coordinating both theaters and war production. Eisenhower was chosen because of his success with the North Africa Campaign. Other likely candidates were bogged down in Italy and MacArthur was stuck in the Pacific.|`|lVAe2SLXaa	Eisenhower was more of a diplomat than any other general officer. Both Churchill and Roosevelt recognised this fact. Monty (although my choice) had an enormous ego, and clashed with other officers, both British and American. Eisenhower spent most of his time soothing bruised egos and smoothing ruffled feathers, all the while diplomatically making these other officers work together for the common good. All of this while making these same people think that cooperation was their own idea. Sneaky bugger wasn't he?|`|RQxZSvFwaa	It was a profound political statement from the US. They were the new empire and considered this war as their making. The British were too battered to have much say over it.|`|sQsl1r5Yaa	Answered previously in this forum:    The choice of Eisenhower as Supreme Commander for Europe was almost accidental, and had a lot more to do with internal American political needs than with Eisenhowers military credentials. Having said that, I concur with the opinion in previous Answers that Eisenhower handled the job well.    But, here is how it happened ...    The decision that a Supreme Commander would be needed was reached by Churchill and Roosevelt at Casablanca (January, 1943), but without selecting a person for the job. Roosevelt was prepared to concur with a Brit for the job, because in the near term any combined invasion force would have been predominantly British.    At that time a British officer, Field Marshal Sir Alan Brooke appeared to be the strongest candidate. Another British officer, Lt. General Frederick Morgan, was appointed Chief of Staff to the as-yet unnamed Supreme Commander. By end April 1943, Morgan concluded that an American should become Supreme Commander, because even if the invasion force itself was mainly British, the follow-up force would surely be predominantly American.    Senior American officials concurred with Morgans analysis, and felt that an American appointee would help speed up a cross-Channel invasion over British reluctance to act precipitously. Stimson and Hopkins were strongly in favor of giving the job to Gen. George C. Marshall. By the time of the Quebec Conference, Churchill was prepared to accept Marshall instead of Brooke, and it appeared that Roosevelt also favored Marshall for the job.    But then came doubts (from within the US - not the British) that Marshall could be spared from Washington. Even so, on the eve of the Allied conferences at Cairo and Tehran at the end of November 1943, Marshall was still seen as the obvious choice for Supreme Commander, Europe.     At Tehran, Stalin grumbled that the Second Front would never get going without a decision on a Supreme Commander. Churchill tried to placate him by assuring him that the British were willing to serve under anyone named by Roosevelt. And Roosevelt assured Stalin that a choice would be made within a few days.    By now, Roosevelt had actually decided that he must keep Marshall by his side in Washington. He began to give serious consideration to Eisenhower for the Supreme Command in Europe instead. Not only had Eisenhower proved his ability to command Allied forces in the Mediterranean theater, but his appearance before the Combined Chiefs of Staff at Cairo had demonstrated a firm grasp of the military situation and added to the good impression he had previously made. Moreover, from the time of the first discussions of a Supreme Commander for Overlord, his name had been coupled with that of General Marshall's as a possible choice to lead the cross-Channel operation, and it was clear that he was completely acceptable to the British (especially to General Morgan).    On 5 December 1943, Roosevelt personally invited Marshall to make the decision. When Marshall insisted that any action of the President would be acceptable, Roosevelt remarked that he believed he could not sleep at night with Marshall out of the country. The President then decided to name General Eisenhower Supreme Commander.

IAXhu2tuaa	Yes. Many do perceive true un-conditional love as a weakness to be exploited. True beauty begins beneath the surface.|`|AA11562077	The contrary view from Lawrence Durrell in 'The Alexandria Quartet':    "Seeing among other objects the empty bottle of Justine's perfume ('Jamais de la Vie') on his mantle, I thought how strange it is that we clutch to something left behind by the departed loved one, something no doubt completely trivial to the person themselves."    and... "A woman writes her best love letters to the man she is betraying."    Hemp once said to me, or words to that effect: "I prefer imagination to experience".  I guess that's why they make chocolate and vanilla. Myself, I'd say it's better for all concerned to see "Love" as a verb instead of a noun.
UzJBYk5zaa	Sorry, I have to backtrack to the ball to explain it all. I think it's implied that they're attracted to each other, but neither of them know it, or at the very least that it's unacknowledged. Mr Darcy is telling himself Lizzy is beneath him, that she doesn't deserve him due to her rank in society. He let his pride carry him away and spoke out loud about it to Bingley, which Lizzy overheard, and if she had any attraction to him it was instantly shelved by that remark.     While Lizzie's opinion is set in stone, Darcy and Miss Bingley realise he has feelings for her. Darcy continues to try to stem the flow of those feelings, but is still drawn to her. Miss Bingley's contempt for country society turns to scorn for Lizzy, whom she sees as a threat to her territory since she planned on bagging Darcy or herself. Darcy has the kind of money she wants, and I think she's even more insulted by the idea that he would not only ignore her, but choose someone from a lower class than herself. So the Bingley girls make life hell for poor Lizzy after that.     That's about where you are now :)|`|LwywrSRkaa	I love all the movies by Jane Austen, I have tried reading Northanger Abbey once but it was difficult! So hmm can't help you with that really.|`|tZF1FO7saa	I have not started it but soon will I am in the seventh chapter of Emma another classic from Jane Austen.|`|DibFrwxlaa	No he doesn't like her then.    Elizabeth overhears Mr. Darcy pretty much saying that she and everyone else except her sister Jane are ugly.|`|9dd2ac44728dd565acf459d4a4e730d0aa	Mr Darcy at that point begrudingly admires Elizabeth because he feels attracted towards her. However, he is unable to come to terms with the fact that she is not at the same level socially and that there are things about her family background which would not not appear well in his world. Her mother is, quite frankly, vulgar and Jane is the only one of the daughters who is not silly. Even Jane, in his view, isn't good enough for his friend Mr Bingley. He is, therefore, a man who is struggling with his own prejudices against Elizabeth while admiring her very much deep down for her wit and beauty.    Read on and you'll see I'm right!|`|xU36GJk2aa	Doethine is correct ...|`|wnc6Y6o0aa	Oh, I just finished that a few days ago. It's brilliant.  Anyway, the ball. Mr Darcy doesn't find Lizzy agreeable, as he says to Mr Bingley. This is a part from the text: "You are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room," said Mr Darcy.    Mr Darcy and Lizzy are rather argumentive throughout the book.  I hope I helped, and I hope you enjoy it!|`|F2jJu5CMaa	Yes he does. (:  It's a weird thing at first he thought her to be only partially beautiful, but it seems as he sees her more he notices the little things that make her beautiful.   for example he says:  "I have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow."  this is meaning to say he likes her eyes. He is also intrigued by her being upfront and open about her mind, which was not common much with woman in the years this book was written.  Hope i helped, and hope you enjoy the rest of the book. (:|`|5xQtFC5naa	I agree with what Doethine has told you. I am glad to see that you are reading this classic. It is one of my favorites.
9CN0ZvAVaa	Well, Snape did seem to be at the wrong places at wrong times. Plus, Quirrel was working for Voldy...I wouldn't have believed him either, who could trust a nut crack like him? Also, Snape was quite mean to Harry, it may have been his way of putting the blame on someone; all signs did point to him so he was automatically suspicious-- I would be too. Harry and I were both wrong in the end though.     And above all i think it was JK's way of leading her audience to believe Snape was bad and then dazzling them at the end. She is a genius. I think it was for the better.|`|MSEyXHFWaa	Because Snape was always mean to him and biased towards his own house. He also constantly put-down Harry's dad.    The rumours that Dumbledore wouldn't even trust snape with Defense against the Dark Arts couldn't have helped either.    Harry also found out that Snape was a former Death Eater. In the third book it is Snape who tries to turn Sirius in and screws everything up for Harry.    Snape was a real jerk towards Harry. Harry still suspected him because Snape still acted like a jerk even after he had saved Harry. I mean, he wanted to have Sirius' soul sucked out; what kind of person would just forget that?    Book 1: Snape acts suspicious  Book 2: Snape acts mean (remember what he said about Hermione?)  Book 3: Snape screws up Harry and Sirius' reunion and makes Lupin lose his job.  Book 4: Snape acts all shady with the Bulgarian headmaster, who is super shady himself  Book 5: Snape acts like a total dick towards Sirius in the Order and pressures him into acting hastily. Harry might even sort of blame Snape's goading for his death. Snape stops teaching Harry how to guard his mind and even leaves him more vulnerable.  You know the rest.    And all throughout this time Snape was still acting antagonistical towards Harry in potions and generally trying to make things miserable|`|gWleYSuIaa	because harry ain't no fool!|`|pF63IMyVaa	because Snape is with the Slytherin house and they have  a rep for being the house with the most death eaters. and he finds out in the 3rd book i think that Snape is working for Voldemort and that Dumbledore shouldnt trust him|`|29maScwJaa	Snape is amazing, and Harry Pottah is going mad from...we cannot say his name..|`|GWB1R0jQaa	Because Snape hates him. And the fact that he fits the part, seeming menacing, intimidating, and "evil".|`|R0iHHPqEaa	cause sn ape was a meany|`|WFl6ErDMaa	because snape is the generally evil looking person...    thought quite strangely hot >_>|`|iBDKtJjcaa	cause snape is creepy?|`|rCNRcF5waa	I'm sure if Snape treated Harry better he would have changed his opinion of him. But Snape was just as much a dick to Harry as Harry was to him. It's hard to have respect for someone that treats you like crap.|`|HhPgZDDzaa	Its more about the way he carries himself. His obsession with the dark arts was another thing to be suspicious about. The fact that he was in Slytherin doesn't help (everyone in Slytherin would be suspicious in my eyes), and the fact that he always seemed out to get Harry|`|HF4ofA3Haa	Well i think the fact that Snape hates him doesn't make Harry like him... and he's creepy, and suspicious... but he's the only one suspecting that hard, so it's not that obvious, maybe it's kind of a sixth sense!  p.s. how does it come you have a reverse nickname??XD Cool!|`|VvKJUCYgaa	I guess Harry just had some unsteady feelings about Snape, not being too clear if he was bad or good, because snape always had a sort of mysterious attitude and fancied the dark arts. I think Harry can be a little bit judgemental and jumps to some conclusions way too fast, thats what annoys me about him though.|`|vzU7uuvRaa	Fair do's, Snape is pretty mean to the Gryffindors. Sirius never liked him. He told the slytherins about Lupin being a werewolf.|`|fe1866161f176b9bdb6df0b378e99a13aa	Have you ever seen him?  He's CREEPY!  ;)|`|8HOygNkGaa	because he is from slithering and always hatted harry!|`|6jzql1ssaa	im guessin it was b/c snape was always accusing him of stuff, and treatin him bad, then he tried to get rid of sirius, which probably made harry think he was bad and then he tried to get him and ron expelled in the 2nd book after they flew the car into the tree...........i think harry mostly....disliked....snape and after the first book he rlly didnt suspect him until book 4, when he saw him with karkaroff(i think that was the guys name)|`|kFNofOZxaa	Because Snape only ever treated Harry with contempt. He did not prove himself trustworthy. Harry believed that the good deeds that Snape performed was down to Dumbledore. Incidentally, Harry could never have seen Snape's Dark Mark before 4th year as it only began to re-appear when Voldemort was returned to a body, and began to strengthen. Ultimately Harry did learn to trust Snape, but alas, it was too late.|`|LwerTaZaaa	Because of the way Snape is. He stalks about the castle looking like and overgrown bat. Haven't you ever gotten a bad vibe from anyone? and would you like someone who so obviously doesn't like you?|`|4IwnTxKiaa	he had a dark mark, and he overheard him talking with malfoy in th 6th book about trying to help him, and of course snape was the one who gave the information to Voldemort about Harry's parents!!!!!!!!|`|ZyJKy9Q5aa	Maybe because Snape looks kind of scary?  And he talks in a creepy way....  and his hair is sooo black and sleek so he does look like an evil master mind...  But he still is cool in a weird way...:D|`|Mpcb8pCCaa	Because from day one Snape was an utter bastard to Harry and was always suspicious looking. It didn't help that he was head of Slytherin, where most of the Dark lords followers came from. Also the fact that most of his friends and the people of gryffindor hated Snape and thought he was dark.

I would say I like Jacob better but just because to me Edward is too much of a prissy boy. Jacob is slightly better  but in the fourth book to me he is to clingy to Renesmee. I mean I know that he's "imprinted" on her or whatever, but to me the worst kind of boyfriends are the clingy ones. I personally prefer Emmett and Jasper just because they seem to be more human. Jasper because he admits that he has problems with sticking to the diet and Emmett because even though he is way competitive he is also a great loser. But that's just me.

YKPeQwGraa	theyre pretty good. But you cant make someone all evil or all good. Lauriel is good cuz shes spoilt and mean but she has pity and doesnt leave joe. But Ally is just all good Joe is half andd half give him some bad qualities and he'll be ok. Remember, this isnt a fantasy so try to picture if a real person would have this personality.No. Alot of ppl seem all good on the outside but you have to dig deep inside the character. That's called making a character 3-D. And mainly it consists of: Personality, Depth of the Personality, Good side, Bad side adn HIstory. Personality: It's not very clear in Lauriel and Joe I can tell Ally is sweet and cool, that's one thing. Depth of Personality: None of them are very deep. Lauriel is above average Joe is average and Ally is below aaverage. Good Side: Clear in Ally and Joe, you have to look deep to see it in Lauriel but font change it that counts as a plus, sometimes you cant jsut throw everything in the reader's face. Bad Side: Not even there in Ally adn Joe. Very clear in Lauriel. Don't change that, you want Lauriel to be a mean character..you have to show all her bad parts before her goods kick in. History: I faintly see it in Lauriel (orphaned: spoilt etc.) all i know about Joe is that he's pretty poor, give reasons why. Ally, I can't tell any of her past. My fav is Lauriel by far. My least fav. is Ally. There are ways for improvements.   These are the cocepts of character making:  Good Name  Depth  History  At least ONE story from past in the book  Looks     Good Name:  We have that covered, it explains how you feel about the characters, I can't see how you can improve, if you don't like ure names here are a couple more. Joe= Nathan, Julian, Jacob. Lauriel: Jessica, Annie, Lizzie. Ally: Kelly, Debbie, Lily.     Depth:  I explaied the concepts earlier on. Leave Lauriel alone she's good enough the way she is. Though I'd like it if she was treated badly at the orphanage and then was spoilt to death by her "adopted parents" that miht bring out her good side when she sees how Joe begs her to stay. It's weird about Joe why would he like such a mean girl. I don't understand. Try to give reasons within the story, don't throw them in the reader's face, that's one of the secrets. About Ally way too much good side, way too less bad side. Give her some bad qualities for example she hates kids or she's a racist or something.     History:  Lauriel's pretty good in this one, jsut let her explain it to someone at a point in time and we'll see it that way. Joe...not much all we know is that he's poor. Explain his family. Try answering these questions: Why would he like Lauriel? Was his family rich or poor? Was he treated well? Did he like his home? Did he have any brothers or sisters? I know that's alot but we need to know. We are the readers and we need to know these things. Allie is the same as Joe.    One story in the past from lifetime:  Not long, just two to three paraghraphs explaining an event, but be careful there, you have to show how they treat others, live their life etc. in this one paraghraph, it's hard. Try thinking of an event in your life that explains who your are. Then try applying that to them. If you can't explain everything in one story add a few mroe. Just dont let them lead you away from the plotline.    Looks:  You got that covered, but incase you need to know the looks show their personality. Looks i mean their facial featurs, body, gender and clothes. Joe obviously wears cheap hand-me-down clothes, Lauriel needs to dress fancily. Tight clothes are good, leather, they're made for show-offs. Ally should wear light, comforable but good and sweet looking stuff.     Hope I helped|`|GIsOtCrzaa	They sound strong... but they also really sound like "Mary Sue" and "John Doe" characters.
PAUB1Sm3aa	I agree. Whenever I see that [even published authors attempt to use that as an adequate excuse] I am slighly saddened by the level of intelligence in the world today.    My theory is that 'OH JUST BECAUSE IT'S NOT REAL!' they think it doesn't have to be consistent.That it doesn't matter when *POOF*! *Wait, what? I thought she was a girl? WHY IS SHE A GUY NOW?*  *Wait, what? I thought vampires couldn't have babies! WTF?*    And it's also an excuse for when you KNOW there's an issue, but then you a) refuse to acknowledge it b) refuse to find a single little flaw in your favorite little book c) the author said it in her/his FAQ and you hang on said author's every little stinking word.|`|AjqO1aJgaa	For the same reason that they think they don't need to spell correctly, or use correct grammar or punctuation... i.e. because they are entitled brats who think they deserve praise regardless of the poor quality of their writing, so why bother spending time on it?    The real world is going to be a dreadful shock to these people.|`|38eb78ef54653766c3ca71d79051901caa	Ridiculous notion, don't you think?    Just as silly as people saying that spelling and grammar are not important to a story.    I wouldn't even attempt to read something that made no sense.  I don't think anybody would, including the person that said that.    I think he/she meant that it doesn't have to be real.|`|Y0ffbZKraa	That is absolutely awful. And, of course, a complete load of crock. Just because it didn't actually happen here doesn't mean it can make no sense. Of course in writing some fiction stories the rules of our reality are bent a bit, but never (in good writing) are they obliterated. We can only hope that person learns a bit more before they leave school - and God help us if it was an adult that said that!|`|dXW9cPWMaa	I've also had this said to me in B&A, and I chalk it up to amateur abilities. When people tell me that their stories don't have to make sense, I want to assume that they mean it doesn't have to follow every constraint of the current world.     However, I've also often found that they think that because it's fiction that they don't have to limit themselves in any way and that they can make things up willy-nilly as they go. I'm certain that any established writer will dispute that, and I don't understand how people can insist that their writing doesn't have to make sense. I wouldn't read something that didn't make sense.|`|245296e926068369590c2d4c49cdf531aa	I don't know! I've seen that type of thing, too, and always in Twilight-related questions. God, it annoys me so much!    Obviously the people who say this are the type of people who know nothing about writing or books. They look at a book as just a story, completely overlooking the fact that books have (or at least should have) depth. And they know nothing about writing because if they did know, they'd know that even fantasy writers have rules that they need to adhere to. They don't understand that this has nothing to do with whether there's magic or not. It has to do with how realistic it is.     And people still say "it's fantasy, it's not supposed to be realistic." Ugh! The things people say!    Edit: "I always took fiction to mean that an author can make whatever he/she wants, so long as it makes sense in the context of the fictional world." That is what it means, Yankee. But people go on and on about how Renesmee's being born is completely valid because Meyer can do anything she wants, because it's fantasy. Which isn't true, because a fantasy story still has to be realistic. And what they don't understand is what realistic actually means. What you just said is what realistic means, "so long as it makes sense in the context of the fictional world."|`|BbdWpp1Caa	I know what you mean. Fiction to me means using concepts that do not exist (that we know of) but you still need to explain how/why they are real in the story.|`|oSsVEXMxaa	Because they don't know anything about writing. Fiction doesn't mean you can pull whatever random sludge you can come up with out of your *** and call it literature.|`|1UxZ3VAWaa	In a way it does have to make sense. Like it can't just be a stream of nonsense words. Whover said it doesn't have to make sense probably means, it doesn't have to follow the rules of gravity, or it can be in an unknown and magical place. But then theres the fiction that tells a story that follows the ways of life, just with an unreal story. LikeCharles Dickens.|`|YKPeQwGraa	hell no it doesnt. Maybe its a mad whaky world but it still has to make sense. If it doesnt make sense noone will unnderstand. Like Harry Potter. You can't just jump from scene to scene, you need to order it in your mind. IT NEEDS TO MAKE S-E-N-S-E! An easy way is trying to read it in another person's point of view and see if there are things u need to understand. If that's hard try showing it to other ppl and we'll see if they understand.|`|Xc02z608aa	That way of thinking is the mark of a young writer and a young reader.  I do think, that some people mean that fiction does not have to follow the rules and restrictions of the real world.  Yes, there is a thing called creative license, but even when the author makes something up it still has to make sense within the story.  If you are writing a fantasy novel, it doesn't make sense to put in machine guns.  If you are writing a historical novel it doesn't make sense to put in a unicorn.      A writer can do anything they want to as long as they can make it make sense.  If they can't make their story make sense then they should go back to the drawing board and start again until they get it right.    I think some of the young "writers" here on B&A use "it's fiction, it doesn't have to make sense." as an excuse to be lazy.  They don't want to put any actual effort into what they are writing, they just want to be seen as a writer.  They just want praise because they managed to string together more than three consecutive sentences, no matter how bad the writing may be.|`|ZaBGMT12aa	I'm not sure that I agree.    I think that a story has to be fluid and make sense as far as plot line goes. I think there has to be an explanation for everything that happens. But as long as there is an explanation for what it happening, why can't something not make sense?    Aliens are fiction and they don't really make much sense, but that's fully within an author's right, isn't it? Why couldn't someone write a story about a group of Amish friends fighting a little known battle in World War II? I mean, that really doesn't make sense, but why isn't that within an author's right as a work of fiction?    I always took fiction to mean that an author can make whatever he/she wants, so long as it makes sense in the context of the fictional world.    If that is incorrect, what is fiction?    EDIT: I suppose I read the question in a different context. Thanks, Lyra! Originally, I thought this question implied that a fiction story had to make sense in the world we live in, but it's talking more about breaking a world's rules, no matter what the world is and justifying it with "it's fiction!"? I can understand that. And I would agree that you really can't do that. There are always rules you have to follow.|`|We6pyWttaa	I think that if a book is fiction it should still show part of reality with out being completely truthful. For example an author could write about a divorce with there spouse. They could keep the plot the same but change the names of characters and the setting to keep the real places and people private. To write a fiction or non-fiction book the characters , plot, setting, motivation of characters, and the theme need to be perfectly clear and understandable . If the book is not made that way it doesn't deserve to be published and is a piece of crap. I don't tell it how you like . I tell it how it is. That's the way the cookie crumbles.

Kvjy5DE2aa	This all depends on your age...  If you're a preteen or under 14 or so, any novels by Gail Carson Levine like The Two Princesses of Bamarre (About 2 opposite sisters, one of which on a quest to save the other from death, falls in love on the way, lots of adventure) or Ella Enchanted (Which I'm sure your familiar with, but is quite different from the movie and is an excellent read) would be a good choice.    If you're looking for something for an older age group, teenager- Thirteen Reasons Why by Jay Asher is excellent. It's about a boy whi finds a box on his porch after school one day with 13 Tapes in it from his crush, who had committed suicide a few days before, all about why she committed suicide.    If you're looking for a more intense read and for an older generation still,  anything by Jodi Picoult is fantastic. The Pact is a deeply sad love story, that has a great message.     I hope this helps!|`|w3uYxwiraa	Sabriel by Garth Nix    It is dark fantasy, about an 18-year-old-girl with the power to bring things back from the dead, but it has been the duty of everyone in her family to KEEP dead things dead and stop an evil necromancer from taking over the world! Here's a brief summary-  The novel is set in two neighbouring fictional countries: To the south lies Ancelstierre, which has a technology level and society similar to that of early-20th century England, and to the north lies the Old Kingdom, where magic works and dangerous spirits roam the land  a fact officially denied by the government of Ancelstierre and disbelieved by most of Ancelstierre's inhabitants. (Those who live near the border know the truth of it, especially on days when the wind is blowing out of the Old Kingdom.) These dangerous spirits range from undead corpses known as Dead Hands to supernatural beings known as Free Magic elementals.    These living Dead are raised by Necromancers, or black magicians, who roam the Old Kingdom or live in Death, using Hands to do their bidding. To remedy the problem of dangerous, living dead, there is always a sorcerer with the title of Abhorsen, who is essentially a Necromancer himself (or herself), only in the reverse; he puts the dead to rest. At the time of Sabriel, it is her father, Terciel, who has the job of controlling the endless dead creatures doing evil deeds around the Wall, especially difficult since a new evil seems to be rising.    When the current Abhorsen is overcome by one such evil, he sends his bells and sword to his daughter Sabriel, who is being raised in an Ancelstierre school, out of reach of those who might try to strike at her father through her. She must return to the Old Kingdom to rescue her father and prevent the evil's return.|`|4iUejzGvaa	A Great and Terrible Beauty - a girl moves from India to England and learns her mother was part of the powerful tribe the order (Young Adult)    Prom Crashers -  4friends crash 9 proms looking for one mystery "Prince Charming" (Young Adult)    Valley of the Dolls- look at 1940s NYC - lots of scandal and gossipy (kinda like Gossip Girl but better) (Literature/Romance)    The Virgin Suicides - it's actually a really good book sorta depressing but check it out  (Literature)

It was a long blood line which brought Louis to the throne and ultimately to the guillotine, a life he did not ask for. Years of grooming and priming made the boy into the king as years of study realised Frankenstein's ideas. It's a bit loose but it might give you a basic foundation to tie it together.     When i studied it we were told it was about man's desire to play God, harnassing ther powers of life and death even to the exclusion of women.

2bf0afb576f3b1843272a3d582d8496eaa	You'd have to be descended from Natives on the continent.  While there are certainly connections going back, I really think this is stretching it.  You need to have a great grandparent who is Native American to be considered native.  Some tribes go farther back and consider great great grandparents.  You have to be descended from a Native American to be considered one.  There are certainly similarities in cultures from one continent to another - Alaskans and Asians and cultures from South America for example.  And we do know that all humans living today are directly connected to a skeleton found in East Africa.  But Native American means inhabitants of North America usually defined as when the country was colonized.  You would have to be connected to a great grandparent who is Native American since the mid 1800's.|`|ygGr1nX7aa	Well, the Native Americans did cross over to America on a land bridge in what is now the Bering Strait, so it's entirely possible there's a certain amount of genetic and cultural similarity.      However, that would go a LONG way back.  I believe to actually be registered as of American Indian blood you need to be at least one-sixteenth- ie, at least one great-grandparent.  So officially, at least, no.|`|4QizPDQNaa	Not much of a chance. Your family originated from the area of Siberia and you say that you're 100% Kazakhstan, so you don't have a genealogical connection to the Americas. Cultural similarities aren't necessarily an indication of being related to another culture. Some people groups around the world share traditions, customs, even physical features but are not related. There's a very very slim chance that somewhere way back in history you have a common ancestor with a Native American tribe--as in back in the time when most people lived on the same continent and then began migrating to different areas of the world--but that would be several thousand years ago so I don't think it really counts.|`|WxoZrTPlaa	To be considered Native American, you need to be registered on Tribal Rolls.    Yes, there has been scientific proof that Asian people crossed the Bering Strait and are the forebears of the indigenous people of both North and South America.  That being said, however, does not make you Native American.  That would be like me saying that I am Dutch just because a couple generations ago, my ancestors hopped on a boat and left Amsterdam for Little Chute, WI!|`|AA12343309	Native American is a "politically correct" definition given to people whose ancestors were already on the American continents when the Europeans arrived.  It appears their ancestors crossed an ice bridge from East Asia many thousands of years ago.  Considering where your ancestors came from you probably share some genetic relationship  to those people called Native Americans.    Actually I find politically correct definitions can be wearisome.  I had a Choctaw gggrandmother but I would consider myself Native American even if I didn't because I was born in the U.S.
7tiH0gREaa	Yes. I've met many people who've read it and hated it. I am one of those people.|`|Tx8JHmDvaa	yes, here's why   1. bella is annoying, whinny, boring, stupid, and selfish  2. there is a lack of a plot  3. the characters are Mary Sue and Gary Stu, they have no personality, spunk, or the spark of life  4. its written horribly  5. i don't need to read about how "HAWT" edward looks on every page.  6. steph meyer is horrible author  7. breaking dawn was by far the worst book i have ever read. first the impossible pregnancy, and the "fight". meyer sets it up to be really good and then nope, nothing.   8. the ending is TOO perfect  9. bella is TOO perfect when she is a vampire  10. the characters don't learn or change.  11. the annoying fangirls drooling over a fictional character.  12. its overrated  13. it gives girls a horrible message which is woman need a man to survive. especially in new moon, bella becomes catatonic for 6 MONTHS just because edward leaves. then she finds jacob and she'll happy. then jacob tells her he doesn't want to be friends and she's depressed again. come on.  14. the books are sexist  15. the books set feminism back a 100 years  16. my personal favorite, "Twilight made me cry because i could feel a part of my brain dying."  17. it gives a bad name to literature  18. its cliche love. a super hot guy falls for a normal clumsy girl. how many times have i heard that?  19. vampires don't SPARKLE and none are vegetarian. meyer destroyed the name of vampires.  20. shall i continue??? because i have more to say.|`|sR7jM0UCaa	I've read the book.

I think Twilight is a mediocre concept that only is getting so much hype is because of Edward Cullen.  In fact I didn't like the way Stephenie Meyer portrayed the characters.  The fact that E.C. is so beautiful is emphasized everywhere, and I don't understand why he has a connection with Bella, I mean they barely know each other.  Just because she smells good and he can't read her mind? Plus I hated the vampires in her world, I just don't believe in vampires that sparkle in the sun. The unnecessary quotes from Wuthering Heights that have no connection to the story, plus Edward was horrible in Eclipse the way he got all possessive of Bella...Bella Swan..beautiful swan.  I mean all the new kids die to be her friends and she doesn't even care about them, why is it because they are mediocre looking?  I'm sorry I think they books are too shallow, and after Eclipse I just felt like throwing them out the window...  The writing style isnt' impressive at all, she may look upto Bronte and Austen but it doesnt' show.  It's a preteen fad that I hope won't last too long.|`|Vw7tWjtUaa	Do you live under a rock?

Well, he's more than just a beautiful guy. More than his looks, I liked his character, his smartness, mysterious behavior, etc. It's a great book.|`|0WKkXIyKaa	I have read all of the twilight books. i don't hate them, i just don't like them either.   i think that the story could be very good, if it had more twists and just something more that could make you remember it.   I think, if someone important could die at the end etc would make it much better.   A lot of people hate the series now that its more popular. I read the book after the movie came out, but i was put off them because of all the girls who obsess over edward cullen.

xHQPuENAaa	Twilight - There are a lot of meanings for the apple.  http://stepheniemeyer.com/twilight_faq.h...    New Moon - Stephenie said that there is no meaning of the flower.  http://stepheniemeyer.com/nm_faq.html    Eclipse - The broken ribbon represent the choice Bella has to make between Edward and Jacob. It also represents that Bella break away completely from her human life.    Breaking Dawn - This cover is a metaphor for Bella's progression throughout the entire saga. She began as the weakest player on the board: the pawn. She ended as the strongest: the queen.  http://stepheniemeyer.com/bd_faq.html|`|Tx8JHmDvaa	twilight - is the forbidden fruit because bella and edward aren't supposed to be together    new moon - the wilting flower show bella after edward leaves. she's depressed like a wilting flower    eclipse - the ribbon represents bella's torn feelings for edward and jacob    breaking dawn - the red pawn is bella as a human and the white queen is bella after she is a vampire, conquering everything in her path. the queen just shows bella as powerful and hard as marble while the red pawn is her as human filled with blood.|`|XNo8YGyfaa	I really think the first one is wrong. I think it's because before the story there is a quote from the book of Genesis... Eve ate the apple when she wasn't meant to, Bella fell in love with Edward and she wasn't meant to..    "The flower on the cover of New Moon is a variegated, ruffled Parrot Tulip. Stephenie Meyer has stated that the flower has no significance to the story, as she had no part in choosing its design."     "The broken ribbon represents choice, as in the book Bella must choose between her love for vampire Edward Cullen, and her friendship with werewolf Jacob Black. Meyer also stated that the ribbon represents the idea that Bella can't break away completely from her human life"    "The cover is a metaphor for Bella's progression throughout the entire saga; she began as the physically weakest player on the board, the pawn, but ended up the strongest, the queen"|`|km1vuLUzaa	uhh about the Tulip in New Moon, we dont know cos SM said that it was the publisher's choice. she doesnt even know what that stands for though    the ripped ribbons was that Bella had to choose b/w Edward and Jacob.     the chest board the the pawn(the one on the back) represents Bella's human life, she started as the weakest one in the group compared to the Vamps and Werewolves  then the one in front (the queen) as when she became a vamp. she was the strongest one who saved her family and friend's lives in the so-called war b/w them and the Volturi|`|nEhDpDMVaa	If you go to stephanie Meyers website she explains all the covers. Check that for your answer. www.stephaniemeyer.com|`|BZwJeuMGaa	twilight doesnt necessarily have an apple because of her eating it. it has an apple because it was considered a "forbidden fruit", like Edward Cullen was, or Bella was.    This meant alot to Stephenie. However when someone asked her "What kind of flower is that on the cover, and what does it mean?" She had this to say....    ." That is a ruffled tulip. As for the meaning If you've read the Twilight faq, you know that the apple cover had a lot of meaning for me, and I was an active part of the covering process."  -Steph Meyer    New Moon, the ruffled tulip. Steph Meyer helped choose the apple for Twilight, but had no control over New Moon's cover. She doesn't know what it's supposed to mean.   "Something to keep in mind if you intend to embark on a career as a writer: lots of things you might expect to be under your control are not. Covers, for example. Those are mostly up to the publisher and the marketing and sales departments. So I don't know what the tulip meansI didn't have anything to do with this one"  -Steph Meyer    Eclipse, the torn ribbon. It could be Edward over shadowing Jake, which happens in the story. It could symbolize Bella and Jake's relationship being torn apart by Edward for Bella's safety. Bella has to choose who to be a permanent fixture in her life or Bella trying to break away from her life to be a vampire.     Breaking Dawn, the chess pieces. Steph Meyer said that the red pawn represents Bella as a human. She was pretty much, metaphorically, the weakest player on the chess board. The white queen, represents Bella as she transforms from the weakest player to the strongest one; (her change from a human into a vampire).   Stephenie Meyer also said that the cover foreshadows the volturi's confrontation at the end of the book. It foreshadows that the volturi confrontation is merely a court scene, and not a fight scene.|`|poC9j0Diaa	im not sure on new moon and eclipse but on breaking dawn it is the white chess peice becuase bella started out as a weak human, and then she became the strongest.|`|C1NYtzCraa	The apple actually represents the forbidden fruit. I believe Stephenie Meyer stated that the flower actually did not mean anything in particular. The ribbon breaking in half shows her choosing between Jacob and Edward since it was fringed. And on Breaking Dawn the red pawn shows Bella as a human with blood which is why it is red. The white one is Bella as a vampire and a queen in a sense in that she is strong and powerful.  Hope that helps!|`|UY6mkCk2aa	Well, the apple is based on Adam and Eve's story, you know they are pretty much the first couple many people believe and it just represents their love and how the apple was like forbidden, but eve ate it anyways...but Eclipse, New Moon and Breaking Dawn are just very creative, simple, and mind boggling covers, they probably don't represent anything.|`|AA11684725	Actually the thing where Bella is eating an apple a lunch only happens in the movie, not in the book. The real reason why there's an apple on the cover of the book is because there's a quote from the Bible at the beginning of Twilight that makes reference to the forbidden apple in the Garden of Eden.    " But of the tree of knowledge of good and evil,  though shalt not eat of it:  for in the day that thou eatest thereof  thou shalt surely die"  Genesis 2:17|`|baa39b48de9284e241f4e3b1ebe3e6daaa	The apple on the cover is to symbolises the whole Adam & Eve thing in the Garden of Edan because the serpent tempted Eve to eat the apple just like Edward temps Bella and to symbolises forbidden love.    The flower on New Moon does not symbolises anything.    The broken ribbon on Eclipse represents the choice that Bella has to make between Edward and Jacob and that she is torn between them and it also makes refrence to the fact that Edward doesn't want Bella to leave her human life behind.    The Pawn and Queen on the cover of Breaking Dawn are a metaphor of Bella's life. It shows the progression she made throught the novels.      Hope this helps :D    x|`|B5x2S33haa	the flower (ruffled tulip) had nothing to do with the story stephenie mayer stated that she didn't like it much because it was chosen by the publishers because it was a pretty picture.  on the eclipse cover the ribbon breaking is supposed to represent that when you try to make a clean break away from something your going to be left with all the loose ends and frayed edges (something like that)  and the chess game on breaking dawn represented the whole saga. It shows bella's move from being the least important character in the series (the pawn) to the most powerful (the queen) and the one who saved everyone.|`|TE3BCqnbaa	You can always read or know anything you want about twilight on wikipedia or SM web..

What happens in new moon is that edward leaves bella so she can have a normal life.

So she does recreational cliff diving.  And alice (edwards sister who can see the future) see's her jumping but does not see her fall in the water.  So she tells edward.  Edward calls Bella's house but bella's friend jacob picks up and says swan household and then edward asks where is charlie swan and he says at a funeral (it was harry clearwaters) and edward. thinks its bella's funeral so he runs off to italy to have the volturi kill him.  But bella saves him in time.

They are my favorite so far. I could not stop reading them. As for the movie it was in my opion bad. It didnt stick to the book well at all. It also cut some things out from the book and added things. New Moon was my least favorite book in the saga, Just because Edward left and for those of us that get into the book we had to go threw Bellas depression with her. I get into the book so much that her depression was driving me crazy and I couldnt wait for Edward to get back. Which he did.!!:) and I was happy.|`|FIFoGNIxaa	Twilight is my favorite series right now! First, Twilight is about a girl named Bella who moves to a place called Forks. At her new school she meets a vampire named Edward Cullen. They fall in luv. I haven't seen the movie yet but I'm hopin' to!          Also New Moon ( the 2nd ) is about Edward leaving Bella after an accident happens at her birthday party. He's afraid he'll hurt her so he goes to Italy. She ends up hanging out with one of her old  friends Jacob. I like Twilight better than New Moon. To me New Moon was just like REALLY depressing!|`|nHNCslRZaa	I think the movie sucked.

They have a large fanbase which hypes them up to such proportions it makes them seem a bit of a disappointment upon actually reading them. But they are fairly good reads. Stephenie Meyer's other book, The Host, was much better and less predictable, though.  The movie, viewed independently as a movie (a separate entity from the book) was quite good, if a little too romantic and teenager-like at times.    And that's the honest opinion :)|`|MSEyXHFWaa	Because a bunch of people like it and were very vocal about it.    Twilight has spread like some weird-*** disease that turns odinary people into screechy fangirls.    It's like a cult.    Twilight itself is an okay read. Just okay, though. I think what people really like about it is that it's easy to read (very fast) and the whole vampires in love thing.     Some people really find that romantic.|`|E28mQDX0aa	It's horrible. Both the book and the movie.    Stephenie Meyer can not write very well at all. Her writing is very amateurish; she makes many mistakes that could have easily been caught if she had actually read through what she had written and had a decent editor.    Her writing is filled with purple prose and she uses way too many adjectives and adverbs. She abuses the thesaurus and the dictionary and some of her sentences are just worded funny. There are a lot of glaring errors (grammatical, sentence structure, spelling, fragments etc) that would have been easily caught had she actually read through what she had written or her editor had actually done their job.    Plus, the plot is practically non-existent, Up until page 400 it's nothing but Bella obsessing over Edward and how hot and gorgeous he is. Speaking of Bella, she is the most annoying female character I have ever had the displeasure of reading about    Seriously, save yourself time and money... spend it on something that's actually worth it.|`|AA12065466	imdb.com|`|w3uYxwiraa	It's okay.

But its a poorly written piece of fluff that is overly repetitive and dull and the character of Edward is SO pathetic creepy-stalkerish that I truly can not understand why chicks are so obsessed with the guy.    Try Anne Rice or Maggie Shayne's vampire series - incredible writing style and story line.  Real characters not two dimensional cutouts.    The book really is like a plague infecting the planet.

zRPXczxAaa	I am happy to say that I haven't seen the movie Titanic, and one of the reasons I haven't--and never shall--is just such inaccuracy as you mention in the cursing vernacular.  Of course, they swore, and they had as large a vocabulary of swearing oaths (you mean) as we do--but no, they wouldn't have used them in quite that way, as they realized, then ineluctably sank to their watery doom.  You're right--the cadence, and the content, of cursing was quaintly different in 1912 from the scalded prostitute's scabrousness of modern times.
3woyz5ucaa	Stalin wanted to open a second front but America was also delaying it and holding back, and only joined when they were certain the allies would win against Nazi Germany. I heard that what Americans did was that they dressed as Germans and attacked Russians so their progress would slow down and so America can get the atomic bomb first, not to mention all the other goodies received from operation paperclip. The other tensions rose after the war because Russia refused to give up East Germany, Poland, Iran, and other territory captured. One of the territories captured from Japan was actually a prelude to the Korean War (operation August Storm) and the United States and Great Britain also had a plan to attack Russia on June 1, 1945, but didn't due to bluffs and this was also after FDR.|`|gWleYSuIaa	Roosevelt said stalin was a kind of nasty guy and stalin told fdr that he could beat him a foot race|`|zRPXczxAaa	Each had a lot of trouble believing that the other existed.

The tension was between Churchill and Stalin.  Stalin accused Churchill of dragging feet about attacking the fortress of Europe (D-Day).  Churchill had instead, lead the allies into North Africa, Sicily and Italy, all the while Russia was taking (and dishing out) a serious beating in places like Stalingrad and Leningrad.  In the Battle of Leningrad, the Russians lost over 395,000.  Stalin was demanding the allies actually get into the war in Europe proper and take some of the heat off Russia.  A two front war for the Nazis would give him that relief.  Roosevelt and the U.S. were viewed by Stalin and Churchill as being weak, immature and ill-prepared for actual combat.|`|uGI2Ysltaa	The tension emerged more once the war was over, but it may have been present during the war. Despite being on the same side of the war, at the time the U.S. and The Soviet Union were the two remaining superpowers (once they had won the war and Germany was no longer powerful.) They became very competitive, which eventually led to the Cold War, and in 1991, the fall of The Soviet Union. Stalin was also a terrible man, just as horrible as Hitler, and it is pretty hard to get along with a man of that nature.

ceBTTCPwaa	Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy is a fictional character and one of two protagonists in Jane Austen's novel Pride and Prejudice. He is an archetype of the aloof romantic hero, and a romantic interest of Elizabeth Bennet, the novel's other protagonist. The story's narration includes Elizabeth's perspective on events more often than Darcy's, which makes Elizabeth a more sympathetic figure. Usually only referred to as "Mr. Darcy", his first name is mentioned twice in the novel. The novel gives his age as twenty-eight, and his income as 10,000 a year.  Darcy is depicted within the novel as a seemingly cold and aloof man with a large sense of personal pride that frequently expresses itself as arrogance. His apparently distant manner and contempt for those around him earns the disdain of both Elizabeth and many of the other characters over the course of the narrative, particularly in light of the claims of George Wickham, who insists that Darcy has wronged him in the past and who, because of his approachable and charming nature, is automatically given the benefit of the doubt over Darcy. It is eventually revealed, however, that these first impressions are erroneous, as Darcy's seemingly arrogant character masks a sincerely generous and upright nature, and that it was in fact he who was wronged by Wickham, whose own character is revealed to be untrustworthy and duplicitous. Even such matters as his interference in the relationship between Jane and Bingley are presented and re-interpreted as being motivated by genuine concern for the feelings of his friend rather than out of malicious intent.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitzwilliam...    George Wickham - A militia regiment lieutenant touring Meryton early in the novel. He was also the son of Darcy's father's steward. Charming and handsome, he makes a good impression in Meryton society, and his reports that Darcy has cheated him out of a rightful inheritance serve to damage Darcy's reputation there. He is later revealed to be financially irresponsible and morally bankrupt with a tendency to believe the stories he spins.     http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pride_and_P...    http://www.bookrags.com/Pride_and_Prejud...    http://www.bookrags.com/notes/pap/    http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/pride/    http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitN...    http://www.novelguide.com/prideandprejud...    http://www.campusnut.com/book.cfm?articl...    http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monk...    http://www.gradesaver.com/ClassicNotes/T...|`|O9HLoDj9aa	Cuckoo's answer was very accurate. But if you've ever seen Bridget Jones' Diary, Darcy is very similar to Mr. Darcy of Jane Austen's novel, and Bridget's boss is very similar to Wickham.|`|suxCcXkAaa	Darcy and Wickham are essentially foils. Darcy, on the surface, appears to be gloomy, unpleasant, and judgmental, but underneath that rough exterior, he's just an awkward, passionate, nice guy who's just uncomfortable around those he doesn't know and can't deliver on social graces. Wickham, on the other hand, seems like a nice guy on the outside, but is truly a scoundrel--secretly preying on women w/ money to up his worth. Take a look at these character analyses on both of them--they're pretty funny but really informative:    http://www.shmoop.com/character/literatu...    http://www.shmoop.com/character/literatu...

She is disgusted with all the phony section men and people in the English department at her school.  When she meets with Lane, she seems unable to communicate with him also.  In the Catcher in the Rye, Holden also feels very isolated.  He feels that the whole world is full of phonies.  He can't stand actors, his roommate, or anyone else besides the Nuns and Phoebe.  He seems to have a problem with everyone and everything that they do.  He is in a state of constant depression and isolation.  Nine Stories also can contribute to this theme of seclusion.  In A Perfect Day For Bananafish, it is apparent that Seymour Glass feels secluded from the world.  On the elevator, he freaks on a women for no apparent reason.  He foreshadows his death with the bananafish story, and then he kills himself at the end of the chapter.  In For Esme with Love and Squalor, Sergeant X feels completely isolated as a result of shell shock from the war.  He flips on Clay at the end of the chapter, and after refusing Clay's company, X claims that he just wants to be alone.  Other Salinger stories would work well for this too, but I hope this helps.        After I awoke up this morning, I also thought of another theme thats found in a lot of his works.  Salinger seems to idealize certain children in his works.  I'm not sure why, but he usually makes them incredibly clever or intelligent.  In Franny and Zooey, all of the Glass kids could be discussed.  Although they're not children directly in this book, it does talk about how brilliant they were as children on the radio quiz show and their exploration of both Eastern and Western philosophy.  In Catcher in the Rye, Holden's sister, Phoebe, is described as both a funny and intelligent kid.  Holden really likes children, like Phoebe, because they haven't became phony like the rest of the world.  Children are also idealized in Nine Stories.  In Teddy, Teddy is a very smart child.  He seems to be both advanced in his vocabulary and his his philosophical nature.  He understands complex religious teachings that many adults are not able to comprehend.  In For Esme--with Love and Squalor, the narrator is drawn by the children's choir practice.  He finds himself focused on one beautiful girl in particular, Esme.  Later, we find that she is able to converse quite well and she even reads complex subject matter like squalor.  He brother, Charles is also very clever according to the narrator.  He is intelligent in his riddles and according to Esme, he is extremely brilliant for his age.  This focus on children is just another theme found in his works.  Again, I hope this helps.

Try to predict what is going to happen next, as this will get your creative juices flowing!|`|p9gHWY6Haa	I think that the best way to start a book is to imagine the characters with immaculate details in your head. Know their personality, likes/dislikes/ emotions, secrets, and dreams. Start by describing an important event in your book, and just let your feelings flow into the character's. It may seem strange, but it really works! All books are written with some personal elements from the writer. Don't hold anything back, write it if you like it! Have others read it when you are done, or even while you are writing it. The may suggest something that you never thought of before! Good luck on your book, and I hope you get published!|`|w3uYxwiraa	Get the book "on Writing" by Stephen King. It may seem like a biography at first, but it will tell you everything you need to know about how to write a good book.    EDIT:  He doesn't talk about the post-writing process a lot, but he does tell how he got started!|`|4cQSsDaZaa	have an idea, make an organizer and start writing use lots of details and paragraphs though|`|862f8e3d565cf11bb982e86b1a4dcdefaa	I agree with getting On Writing. It's essential. Also go to fictionfactor.com    Don't even worry or think about publishers yet, just write your story. Most first novels are never even finished.    But basics:  Make Character sheets.       Detail your characters, names, hobbies, looks, birthdays, music, films, EVERYTHING  Write the general idea.  Write Basic Outline:       Only do a general 'what's going to happen when' to start off with.   Then just start writing!      Good luck!|`|RxkGpV7xaa	The best thing to do, is open up Microsoft Word (or your equivalent), and start typing. That's what I do. Then when you've got a few chaptors in, reread what you've written, and make sure it's still understandable.    Regarding getting published, you can speak to your library about that :)      Basically, don't bore yourself. I've never written out style sheets such as characters, etc. I find it easier to just let them develop over time. So, enjoy the time writing 8)|`|DZIKlOfbaa	People will tell you to write up an outline--but that's never helped me.  (Then again, I've never gotten past page 187 in a book).  To me, that takes all the fun out of it, but have a plan.  Know what's going on even if your readers don't.  People may also tell you to write the book out of order, which is also an option, but again, has never worked for me.  That doesn't mean it won't work for you.  It won't hurt to brush up on your grammar and vocabulary either, but don't use words you don't know and don't randomly put them in.  (I found an online British slang dictionary because I was writing about an English character and put in the words where I could, but my friend saw right through it, so don't do that.)    Now, to get published, as far as novels go, you need an agent, which shouldn't be that hard to find, you probably even use a friend.  Books without endorsement end up in the ominous "slush pile."  While those manuscripts get read, they most likely aren't taken as seriously and aren't top priority.      As far as publishers go, I love Random House and Harper and Simon (Pulse) but that's for fiction.  The lists of publishers would vary depending on what genre you're writing.  My adivce?  Go to a bookstore and look at the publishers (usually on the spines) of the books in the section(s) in which your book would appear.    Remember: good writers are good readers.  Good luck!

dh42Aksiaa	Im a classical guitar conservatoire graduate with lots of performance and teaching experience. I say this not to impress somebody, but simply because from my experience of learning and teaching the classical guitar there is only one real answer to your question:    Get a classical guitar method! One such as those from Mateo Carcassi or Sagreras. These books cover all the thing you mentioned (including note reading and how it relates to the guitar neck, technique and interpretation), but the they do it in an educational manner that has been proven to get results.     These books have been written in such a way as to gradually give you tangible results.  Because they are method books, they teach the student in a progressive and correct way, and as a result you may find yourself tackling your favorite piece easily and with great results.  They use exercises as well as studies (musical pieces  devoted to teaching you a certain technique) to build your technical as well as interpretative skills.  Besides teaching technique, methods also facilitate intimate knowledge of your instrument, which is just a fancy way of saying that you will know your guitar inside and out. But can you really teach yourself classical guitar? Yes, you can. Two of the greatest classical guitar players ever, Tarrega and Segovia, where self taught. For more in depth theory you might have to get some theory books, but a good classical guitar method will give you the basics.     If you have any questions feel free to contact me.

cb5cb44a2fed0fb2497e1f4a938b8bffaa	I know a few. There is one called mirrors where two people stand face to face and make movements and try to follow the other. One person is the leader then they switch. The objective isn't to make the other person mess up it's to learn to follow someones lead and learn to trust that they won't try to mess you up. So you can depend on each other.   Also a great one is when you just sit down and start a conversation. A great first line is something like "what happened to us" or "can you believe that he did that?" After that the two just sit there and casually try to continue the conversation. It's all improv but you establish a storyline and even end up creating some interesting characters. It can also be done in a group setting.     Another is to take cue cards with a name and an emotion and a situation and play it out that way. The person randomly selects one card from each category and has to work that into the storyline. This is great for 1 on 1 and also for groups.|`|OQb533GPaa	improv is always good . . . it keeps you on your feet and helps with becoming more comfortable when you're in front of people.  you can do things like listing off names of animals starting with A-Z.  you could pick several props and make up little scenes about them.  some of my friends and i have even played charades with pictionary cards (picking a noun from each card).|`|wqHRZFveaa	This is an exercise i did in my drama class. Both people pick a television show or movie and one person acts a scene out. The other person yells, "Freeze!!!" and they start acting out their show. But the catch is, when the first person starts acting again, they have to start from a later point in the show. Its as if you flipped through all the channels then returned to your show.  Heres an example:            Jack: Hey, Edward. Where's Alice?                              Jill: Freeze!!! Hey, Miley, its Lilly! Wanna go shopping?           Jack: Freeze!!! Bella, come on! We're going to be late for class!                                                                                                                      already answered her question and move on to them being late for class.      Hope you get it... it was kind of difficult to explain... lol  have fun in drama!

The choice of words used to describe their actions or their appearances. be careful with the choice of words too-----    for instance:        he was a lean boy, wearing his head high, his tall stature catching students eyes and attention towards him.         he was a thin boy, lanky; he wore a weary and almost worried expression as he tried to knell a bit, trying to lower his body and not stand out as much in a crowd.        there, i used lean and thin. There's also bulky, implying strength, or large, which could be either strength or fat. Be careful with words.

If agent thinks he can sell manuscript. he will offer to represent it to editors at tradiitonal publishing houses.

Republican shields were oval (about 1.20 meter high and 90 cm wide, the latter rounded). After the Marian reforms and in imperial times the top and bottom were cut off, making the shield rectangular.   The shield boss was a big metal knob, used to punch the enemy with.    The scutum formed an important part of the legionaire's protection. Medieval shields are usually smaller, but the soldier wears more and heavier armour.

iT4gn3z8aa	Japanese submarine slammed two torpedoes into her side, Chief. We was comin' back from the island of Tinian to Leyte. We'd just delivered the bomb. The Hiroshima bomb. Eleven hundred men went into the water. Vessel went down in twelve minutes. Didn't see the first shark for about a half-hour. Tiger. thirteen-footer. You know how you know that in the water, Chief? You can tell by lookin' from the dorsal to the tail. What we didn't know...was that our bomb mission was so secret, no distress signal had been sent. They didn't even list us overdue for a week. Very first light, Chief, sharks come cruisin' by, so we formed ourselves into tight groups. It was sorta like you see in the calendars, you know the infantry squares in the old calendars like the Battle of Waterloo and the idea was the shark come to the nearest man, that man he starts poundin' and hollerin' and sometimes that shark he go away... but sometimes he wouldn't go away. Sometimes that shark looks right at ya. Right into your eyes. And the thing about a shark is he's got lifeless eyes. Black eyes. Like a doll's eyes. When he comes at ya, he doesn't even seem to be livin'... until he bites ya, and those black eyes roll over white and then... ah, then you hear that terrible high-pitched screamin'. The ocean turns red, and despite all your poundin' and your hollerin' those sharks come in and... they rip you to pieces You know, by the end of that first dawn, we lost a hundred men. I don't know how many sharks there were, maybe a thousand. I do know how many men, they averaged six an hour. Thursday mornin', Chief, I bumped into a friend of mine, Herbie Robinson from Cleveland. Baseball player. Boson's mate. I thought he was asleep. I reached over to wake him up. He bobbed up, down in the water, he was like a kinda top. Up-ended. Well...he'd been bitten in half below the waist. At noon on the fifth day, a Lockheed Ventura swung in low and he spotted us, a young pilot - a lot younger than Mr. Hooper here - anyway, he spotted us and a few hours later a big ol' fat PBY come down and started to pick us up. You know, that was the time I was most frightened. Waitin' for my turn. I'll never put on a lifejacket again. So, eleven hundred men went into the water. 316 men come out, the sharks took the rest, June the 29th, 1945.      -Quint from Jaws    ( If you haven't seen this scene, you need to.)

lSV8D9Rfaa	Martin Luther lived in a time when the only Christian doctrine was catholic. In this time the leaders of the catholic faith made some questionable decisions that he did not agree with. These include the sale of indulgences. Luther wanted to remain Christian but he did not agree with the recent actions of the catholic church so he wrote the 95 theses and nailed them to the door of his local catholic church. As a result he was excommunicated (kicked out of the catholic faith). His belief in a strong Christian faith did not include following the pope and various other things. With his revolt the religion known as Christianity split into 2 sections, the Catholics (follow the pope) and the Protestants (do not follow the pope). From the protestant faith many denominations spawned including Methodist, Presbyterian, Baptist, and of course the one named for him, Lutheran.

What did it achieve? She's depriving her fans. The ONLY people who care about her below-par books.     If I were a fan of hers, I'd be feeling pretty disillusioned with her about now.

gm9QYLjIaa	The caricaturist condemns Trotsky for selling his articles to the British Newspaper The Daily Express. He must be a Stalinist or even only a die hard soviet fan that was not liking Trotsky's plan to globalize communism by mingling if you will with foreign newspapers, not to mention the fact that he was most probably bad mouthing Stalin to the whole world. As far as I know Trotsky also gave interviews to the Daily Express. The cartoon gives the impression of a mad man attempting to kill people with his pen, the pen which generally stands for the sword of writers, while working for the newspaper.    As far as I know Trotsky wrote to several other foreign newspapers that would print his works.|`|eef0fd7a18ed1e8ac453b6086f666edfaa	Trotsky was mainly a writer. Other countries tried to portray him as a mad man with a pen.|`|aTAUOI8caa	It's an attack on the Daily Express.    It's calling the newspaper a mouthpiece and propaganda spreader for the Communists; of which Leon Trotsky was still a part as I recall at the time.    Basically, they print whatever drips out of his mouth.

His words are in Act 1 Scene 2, right after Capulet talks to Paris.    Then he has to find someone to read the names to him, so he can fulfill his mission. The person he asks just happens to be Romeo.

Breaking Dawn was disappointing since Stephine lead up to what everyone thought was going to be a epic battle since oh but no...is was all rainbows and kittens. Everyone is friends the Volturi leave. And blam Happily ever after.UGH. But I like the Jake's point of view part in that book. It was very cool.|`|ymK1hg2Raa	ooooh, that's hard! i love all of them, but i think eclipse or breaking dawn.|`|WshwHtk9aa	I have to say Eclipse was the most interesting to me.      "Breaking Dawn made me feel cheated. I hate the ending."  I agree. That ending was what the author wanted and forced onto the story; it was NOT the ending that the story needed and demanded be told. It could still have been "happy" while being more decisive and aggressive, with a lot less deus ex machina at the end.Plus, the end just kindof undercut so much about what was special in the stories that came before.|`|RaUndRx8aa	Twilight is my favourite!!     but i like breaking dawn to i don't get why people hate the ending i think it was really nice way to close the saga.     |`|FHYjZx1Kaa	I'm gonna say Breaking Dawn was my favourite, but I'm not sure if thats because I liked that particular story best or because I really couldn't wait to see what happened at the end of the saga.    Eclipse and Breaking Dawn were both action packed which was great.  Another thing about Breaking Dawn was that I read so many people saying it was awful that I was determined to keep an open mind. I really enjoyed it, and was pleased everything worked out for them all.|`|3rdXOSLVaa	Twilight was the best. Breaking Dawn made me feel cheated.

It's now one of my favorite books and I can't wait for the sequel to come out it in September. Yay!! <br>  <br>  I highly suggest you read it.|`|KkJZg9dFaa	Yes, it was amazing!  It was so well written and the author did an amazing job.  If you liked Twilight, you will probably like this.

The book was funny, creative, and it kept me reading the whole time!|`|i0rKPYLJaa	I have read it, and I really, really enjoyed it. I gave it to all my friends, and they liked it too.

Sure, it might make it sound more appealing, but not always, and prose can be just as inviting and thought provoking as poetry with rhyme. <br>  2.

It really has to rhyme. This is very important, as it explains to the reader they are reading a poem.<br>  B. It should be at least 25% more about me, Kenny. This is a the most important part of any poem. Or prose for that matter.

3WCXGRaGaa	Trying not to repeat words over and over agian... ^^|`|AA10738539	Yes, writing the first sentence can be difficult.  What you might want to try is starting somewhere in the middle.  If you think about it, the first paragraph often introduces what will come later, and if you haven't already written "what comes later," it may be difficult to get started.  The part that I find difficult, but often the most rewarding, is editing.  With today's word processing programs, editing is easier in one way--just delete something and add something else.  At the same time, the ease of using these programs encourages people to make large changes--moving whole paragraphs--that would have been more of a problem back in the age of the typewriter.  What I'm trying to say here, is that editing is a critical part of writing and one that requires the editor to be as exacting as possible.|`|d2bca6X2aa	Getting tired of the storyline, I'm a writer and I'm currently working on one of my 'books' (isn't a book yet because it hasn't been published...yet) and I've written so much that I'm kind of sick of it so I just have to take a break and read a book or start and different story so I get my mind off it and soon enough I'll miss it.<br>  The first sentence always seems to come easily to me, I guess it just that when I come up with a new idea the first sentence is what gave me the idea!|`|02c048e10733ab7f5a7f2b2faf444d62aa	Just getting started.  I have learned to sit my butt down and write.  I don't go back and rewrite that first sentence until the entire story is out of me.  Then I go for a rewrite or 700.|`|Qbs1IZZjaa	I've always struggled with maintaining the balance between action and non-action.  A friend told me recently that he felt exhausted after a few pages of a work in progress.<br>  <br>  Another thing that is hard for me is actually finishing a story.  I'm constantly horrified when I look through my stories at how many unfinished ones there are!<br>  <br>  I also have a suggestion about first sentences.  Always start with the second sentence.  Once you get going the first sentence will often just work itself out.|`|wTkvkWscaa	The hardest part for me is sticking to one thing. As I'm writing, all these wonderful sounding sentences and ideas rush into my mind. So I'll get distracted from the main idea, and go off on over the top or seemingly pointless details. I'm A.D.D, so that might have something to do with it. But once I work it in right, I've been told the details the seem pointless actually contribute to the character quite nicely (I almost always write in first person).|`|UXuGCgo3aa	Personally, I find the actual writing easy enough.  For me it's revision.  Ugh, I hate reading over the same thing time and time again simply to find errors.  And I DESPISE naming characters!

NYU37jfGaa	victorian girls of the upper and middle classes were generally carefully chaperoned and not allowed to be alone with young men.  They would meet men at parties and dances and other social occasions.  If a young man liked a girl, he might ask for permission to 'call' on her at home.  They would be allowed to talk together, with a chaperone at a discreet distance.    If a young man wanted to ask a girl to marry him, he would ask her father's permission either before or after asking the girl. This would generally just be a formality though, since it would be unlikely that a man would be allowed to get to know a girl well enough to ask her to marry him unless her parents approved of him in the first place.    However, during the later part of the Victorian era increasing numbers of middle class girls were going out to work, as teachers, nurses, librarians, typists, stenographers etc, and there might be more opportunities for them to meet men away from home or social occasions.  It would become more difficult to chaperone young girls when they were out earning a living.    Working class girls who would be out and about more on their own would have more opportunity to see men without supervision.  However,a  working girl migh tfind it difficult to find the time for courting, especially if she was in domestic service, as a great many girls were in the Victorian era.  employers were often opposed to their servants having 'followers' and might make it difficult for the girl to meet her young man very often.      It is evident that even when they worke dhard though, young women found the time to enjoy themselves.  An in-house newspaper produced by the workers at thge Seigel-Cooper department store was full of stories about whom was dating whom and comments on other workers' hairstyles and clothing,d ancing ability and general popularity.  The men in the mail-order department accused the members of the Bachelor Girls Social Club of being "man haters" a charge the Bachelor Girls took up with umbrage. "No, we are not married, neither are we man haters, but wee believe in women's rights, and we enjoy our independence and freedom notwithstanding that if a fair offer came our way we might . . . consider it."    Arranged marriages were not the norm in the Victorian era (as a comment above suggests) though it is certainly true that it would be difficult for a girl to marry a man her parents did no tapprove of.  But then she would generally be mixing in a social circle of people of whom her parents did approve anyway.  Within her own social set, she would choose her own mate.    Then, as now, some marriages were happier than others. But a Victorian married woman probably had as much chance as a modern woman of being happy in her marriage.  At any rate, the high divorce rate today does not suggest to me that modern married women are invariably happy with their lot.    it is not true that women could not own property in the Victorian era.  Single women and widows could certainly own property, and laws were passed during the course of the century which gave married women control of their own property also.  By the late Victorian era, married women could certainly own their own property.    Nor is it true that women had no parental rights.  Again, the laws were changed in the course of the 19th century, and women in the late Victorian era certainly did have parental rights.  And they could divorce husbands for adultery, cruelty and desertion, so it was not obligatory for them to put up with abusive spouses.    And antiseptics, which were used from the middle of the Victorian era, meant that the rate of death in childbirth among women declined dramatically.|`|f696776b941b55b420115b639c09c57aaa	Hard, women had little power, could not own property, had no parental rights, and had no way to support themselves.|`|cOJVE9Wlaa	****! x|`|XAAF7R23aa	I think it depended on your social group whether you enjoyed your life. There were arranged marriages then, women couldn't vote or own property. If they got married, it became their husbands property. Girls in service worked  over 12 hours a day for very low pay. Women had very few rights in early Victorian england.Very few jobs were open to them because most did not get the benefit of an education, women had one child after another, there was no  contraception and a lot died in childbirth of puerperal fever because of the lack of cleanliness. It was  a woman's lot to marry and produce offspring, they in effect were their husbands chattels, Women who had children without the benefit of wedlock,  could end up in the workhouse for the rest of their  lives, or even committed to an asylum. So i do not think i would have liked to have lived then. I suppose it depended on the man you married.

B8Gwxo1laa	"The SHORT Summary of King Lear<br>  This drama is one of the great tragedy themed plays by William Shakespeare. The themes of the play cover greed, betrayal, lust for power, and cruelty. The story of King Lear, an aging monarch who is headstrong old man who is blind to his weaknesses, decides to divide his kingdom amongst his three daughters, according to which one recites the best declaration of love. Goneril and Regan who are the selfish daughters of Lear who pretend to love him but later treat him cruelly. Cordelia who is the loyal and unselfish daughter. King Lear disowns Cordelia after confusing her honesty with insolence. The end of the play ends in death by various methods including poison and suicide. Cordelia dies and King Lear, now a broken man, also dies. <br>  <br>  The LONGER version<br>   <br>  Lear, the aging king of Britain, decides to step down from the throne and divide his kingdom evenly among his three daughters. First, however, he puts his daughters through a test, asking each to tell him how much she loves him. Goneril and Regan, Lear’s older daughters, give their father flattering answers. But Cordelia, Lear’s youngest and favorite daughter, remains silent, saying that she has no words to describe how much she loves her father. Lear flies into a rage and disowns Cordelia. The king of France, who has courted Cordelia, says that he still wants to marry her even without her land, and she accompanies him to France without her father’s blessing.<br>   <br>  Lear quickly learns that he made a bad decision. Goneril and Regan swiftly begin to undermine the little authority that Lear still holds. Unable to believe that his beloved daughters are betraying him, Lear slowly goes insane. He flees his daughters’ houses to wander on a heath during a great thunderstorm, accompanied by his Fool and by Kent, a loyal nobleman in disguise.<br>   <br>  Meanwhile, an elderly nobleman named Gloucester also experiences family problems. His illegitimate son, Edmund, tricks him into believing that his legitimate son, Edgar, is trying to kill him. Fleeing the manhunt that his father has set for him, Edgar disguises himself as a crazy beggar and calls himself “Poor Tom.” Like Lear, he heads out onto the heath.<br>   <br>  When the loyal Gloucester realizes that Lear’s daughters have turned against their father, he decides to help Lear in spite of the danger. Regan and her husband, Cornwall, discover him helping Lear, accuse him of treason, blind him, and turn him out to wander the countryside. He ends up being led by his disguised son, Edgar, toward the city of Dover, where Lear has also been brought.<br>   <br>  In Dover, a French army lands as part of an invasion led by Cordelia in an effort to save her father. Edmund apparently becomes romantically entangled with both Goneril and Regan, whose husband, Albany, is increasingly sympathetic to Lear’s cause. Goneril and Edmund conspire to kill Albany.<br>   <br>  The despairing Gloucester tries to commit suicide, but Edgar saves him by pulling the strange trick of leading him off an imaginary cliff. Meanwhile, the English troops reach Dover, and the English, led by Edmund, defeat the Cordelia-led French. Lear and Cordelia are captured. In the climactic scene, Edgar duels with and kills Edmund; we learn of the death of Gloucester; Goneril poisons Regan out of jealousy over Edmund and then kills herself when her treachery is revealed to Albany; Edmund’s betrayal of Cordelia leads to her needless execution in prison; and Lear finally dies out of grief at Cordelia’s passing. Albany, Edgar, and the elderly Kent are left to take care of the country under a cloud of sorrow and regret."Longer|`|7APv8E6Taa	If you have to do a book report and have not chosen a book. I would suggest The Adoration of Jenna Fox by Mary Pearson. It is about a girl who was in a coma for over a year and when she wakes up she remembers nothing of what happened or even who she is. Her father created a company that deals with medical experimentation and development. I would tell you more but it would ruin the book. All I can say is that it fits your description of a book that deals with medical, ethical, and social issues.

If you really want to be a published author some day you MUST equip yourself with the proper tools!  The quickest way to disinterest an editor is inappropriate or non-existent punctuation (and poor grammar.)  As a professional you MUST have these skills - and not depend upon others.  I'm not trying to discourage you.  This is constructive criticism and given with honesty and encouragement.  <br>  <br>  In that vein, may I suggest that you call around to the English & Creative Arts Dept. of your local colleges & universities and ask if they sponsor a writer's group?  Many do - and many of them would accept you as a member.  If you can find one JOIN IT!  It will be an immense help to you in so many ways!  <br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|hGVkInSnaa	Try posting some of your stuff on fictionpress.net so other people can read your stuff and leave reviews, telling you what they like and do not like about your story.<br>  <br>  And if you have problems with punctuation and grammar, then take some lessons on those subjects.

Percy Jackson and the Olympians (THE LIGHTNING THIEF, THE SEA OF MONSTERS, THE TITAN'S CURSE, and THE BATTLE OF THE LABYRINTH) by Rick Riordan is an awesome series, has Greek mythology and fighting, as well as humor.

R5UIMBvcaa	The attitudes are pretty widely different!  In The Epic of Gilgamesh, the only wrong involving sex seems to be taking a woman from her husband.  That's one of the acts of Gilgamesh that his subjects complain to the gods about.  You'll notice that the temple prostitute who seduces Enkidu and teaches him that he's a man in more than one sense of the word is not regarded at all negatively.  She simply serves Ishtar, the goddess of love and fertility.  (We see Ishtar in the latter capacity when she threatens to blight the crops if the gods don't avenge the insult Gilgamesh has dealt her.)   At the end, when Gilgamesh dies, he is mourned by both a wife and a concubine--just one of each, for what that fact is worth.<br>  <br>  We can infer from the various sins that Dante mentions in the Inferno that to him, the only non-sinful sexual relations were those between a husband and wife.  He has various parts of  Hell for those who transgressed that restriction, but one distinction he made involved love.  In Circle Two, the highest circle of actual punishment, people who committed adultery or fornication with people whom they loved are merely blown in eternal circles by the wind.  The fact that they transgressed for the sake of love, which is the nature of God, makes their sin almost excusable.  <br>  <br>  Much farther down, in Circle Eight (simple fraud) are seducers and panderers--people who used others sexually, either for their own sexual gratification or for profit.   Although it isn't said explicitly, Dante's reasoning seems to have been that the seducer misleads his victim into thinking he loves her and in that way causes her to commit an immoral act, and the panderer persuades someone to have sex with a third person, who then pays the panderer--who thus causes one and enables the other to commit an immoral act.  <br>  <br>  A bit above the panderers and seducers, in Circle Seven, are the people Dante calls perverts but whom we would probably just call homosexual men.  Here Dante doesn't have anything to say, even implicitly, about love or other motives--he simply places them in the circle for violence, specifically in the round for violence against nature.<br>  <br>  So check those circles and put things in your own words!

You will save a lot of $$..<br>  <br>  The paper type depends a lot on the subject matter. High gloss paper looks and is sharper for things that can use it. Motorcycles, cars, boats, some still life and scenery. Most people and kids look better on semi gloss to matt paper. <br>  <br>  When framed, try not to have the print right against the glass. It can bond, stick, to the glass in time and ruin the print.<br>  <br>  Now, as to this DPI and PPI crap'ola..! It means NOTHING. All that really matters is the pixel count of your image. It takes 200 pixels to make a inch of photo that looks good.<br>  <br>  A 8x10 only needs 1600x2000 pixels to look good, and printers print so fine these days you will not see any 'dots'...

KKev7q04aa	Maybe you could make a poem about a couple of proffessional wrestlers (like what's on TV) give them crazy/gruesome names and costumes and, of course, they don't obey any kind of rules, kicking each other in the "nuts", smashing chairs on each other, etc. Then write a poem about something more serious like the training & practice you would need to do to be a good wrestler. Just let your imagination run wild. Maybe a nice poem about nude female mud (or jello) wrestling would be in order? Maybe describe a wrestling match but describe it like they do the lovemaking scenes in a romance novel "...their sweaty bodies entwined, hands groping everywhere in the darkness, their heavy breathing like an overloaded steam engine as each struggled for the dominant position..." you got the idea.
wmBK9uASaa	I live in Lincoln<br>  It`s a very modern and vibrant uni with a city that (much to it`s detriment in some cases) has geared itself up to accommodating the uni,it has many facilities from the Engine Shed venue that gets many big names in to the sports ansd social side,loads of halls for new students and a good central position,as for the graphic design bit as it`s a new uni (only about 10 years old) it`s gaining a reputation,they have a perticularly good film /media course,<br>  sorry but the comments below about Lincoln being racist is utter rubbish,|`|koUrI6m4aa	Its good yes, but the place is very, very depressive and scary. I was in Lincoln if you are a foreigner do not go there as you will be a victim of racial harassment! One of the biggest racists in the UK after Glasgow! I was sworn there because my skin was brown, and was also hit on the head.<br>  <br>  So think where to study carefully before taking a drastic decision. Best Uni is not always the best thing. There are other factors such as depression, the weather, the people, etc that can affect you more.

tfVMsbqXaa	I'm on the MFHS Varsity Dance Team and I've never had more fun in my life. I've met so many great friends and have gone through so many amazing experiences. If you've never danced before, getting some background knowledge will really help you out. Some things can be really challenging so don't get frustrated and give up. If your high school team is anything like mine, you won't regret trying out, at all. Good luck and I hope you make it!
q01XVvnhaa	There are many ways to get your toetouch higher. It's recommended that you get all of your splits down because that will help all of your jumps. Also make sure to work on stretching your hip flexors so that your jumps will hyperextend and also work on your ab and leg muscles. Your abs will help push you off the ground and your legs will need power to kick up high in the air.<br>  <br>  Stand in front of a blank wall and stand on your tip toes and raise your hands straight up into the air to see how high you can go. Have someone take a piece of duct tape and put a piece on the wall right above where your fingertips touch. Now for part of your exercises, you should bend your legs a little bit and jump up into the air to touch the tape. Come back down and jump again. Keep your arms straight and up in the air the entire time. Do this exercise and jump as many times as you can (touching the tape each time) for about a minute. After a week, raise the tape a little higher and keep doing this until you can't go any higher. This will strengthen your calves for your jumps.<br>  <br>  To work your abs, you should try doing the 10 minute abs video off of youtube. I don't know who made it, but it will work out your entire core to help you have power in your jumps.<br>  <br>  To stretch your hipflexors, sit down on the ground in a straddle stretch position. Don't try to reach your maximum level of a straddle stretch. It's ok to bring your legs 3-4 inches more together than your full out straddle. Now what you're going to do is stretch your right hip flexor first. Put your right hand on one side of your right leg and your left hand on the other side of your right leg. Keep your butt on the ground and lift your right leg 2-4 inches off of the ground and hold that position for 10-15 seconds. Put your leg down and rest a few more seconds. And stretch your right hip flexor again. Do the same thing on your left leg. To stretch both of your hip flexors at the same time (after you've stretched each side individually) you will place the palms of your hands on the ground right underneath your butt so that your butt is resting on your hands. Lean your back back a little bit and lift both legs 2-4 inches off the ground. You don't want to lean so far back that you don't feel the stretch, but make sure you can feel the burn in your hip flexors. The more you do this the more hyperextended your jumps will be.<br>  <br>  Also, if you have someone spot you on a toetouch on land (the spotter will grab your hips and push you into the air and keep holding onto you til you land) you can practice rolling your hips in the jump. Most cheerleaders with hyperextended jumps will actually "sit" into their toetouches while in the air. I can't explain how to do it, but your coach should be able to help explain it to you. Best of luck!|`|8dacj8Nyaa	All I can say is the stretch. Streching is the only way unless you were born flexible and/or double jointed. Sorry but doing the splits really does help. So just stretch stretch strech!<br>  <br>  <br>        A little pain for a little air...lol.|`|V2v66A7Waa	<a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Do-a-Toe-Touch-Jump" rel="nofollow">http://www.wikihow.com/Do-a-Toe-Touch-Ju...</a> hope this helps!<br>  it actually helped me alot!<br>  <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Jump-Higher" rel="nofollow">http://www.wikihow.com/Jump-Higher</a> this would help you to jump higher!

I just picked up this book to see what all of the fuss was about (I'm 22) and I hated it. It was poorly written, and I am surprised it has gotten the attention it has. That aside, I would NEVER allow my 12 year old to read it. First of all, it is about a girl in high school, second...it is about love and lust (which no 12 year old should really be interested in), and third, through the whole book Bella is hiding things from her parents. Great example for a 12 year old. The only thing that I can think of that would put it in that age group is that there is no depth to her writing style, and it is an easy read,|`|AHuBqplbaa	Because the ideas and characters in the story are shallow and weak, the plot unoriginal, and the writing completely unimaginative and amateur.

NeOwDBulaa	Yes, unless you are instructed to write  about the article or the issue, in which you still have to credit your source.<br>  <br>  Dropping articles into the thesaurus and handing it in to a teacher as your own work, per say, is plagiarism.|`|d2bca6X2aa	Depends...|`|kEWknILEaa	Yes.  If you can take the same information from three or four different sources, then it's general knowledge, and you don't need to cite the source (depending on your teacher's standards); but if you're getting ideas from one source and you pass them off as your own ideas, then that's plagiarism, even if you've changed the language.|`|b0671baa4250635dc2776a5c370a0016aa	Yeah, that's plagiarism ...you have to tell where you got ideas from that you didn't think of yourself.

(The authorities didn't want the bad press from having women dying in prison).<br>  <br>  After the institution of force-feeding, they didn't have the dying problem or the having-to-release-them problem, but the story got out about how horrific the force-feeding was, and they got the bad press all the same.<br>  <br>  The barbarism of force-feeding, and the public's horrified reaction to it, was a major factor in turning public support in favor of the sufragettes and their cause.
0QWSkCucaa	You're right that you really don't need expensive equipment to get a good sound. If you haven't bought a computer yet I would definitely recommend a Mac - they are amazing for all kinds of audio and video stuff and you'll get so many less problems with them than you will with windows. A MIDI keyboard and a microphone are the next couple of things you need - the MIDI keyboard should connect through a USB port (make sure you get one that will do this) and if you use Garage Band (free software that comes with Macs) you will be able to play and record from the keyboard using a whole range of instruments. The microphone could also be a USB one (these are slightly more expensive but definitely worth it) or a normal jack input one, but you get what you pay for in terms of mics - don't just go for the cheapest one.<br>  The speakers you get from the computer should be fairly decent ones but you can get these cheaply. Go for ones which use an external power supply as the ones which take power from the computer aren't so good. When you're recording from the keyboard and doing the mixing/editing you should be listen from the speakers rather than headphones, because it will sound different between the two and you want to be hearing it as it will sound in the end. You will need good headphones as well though for when you're recording with the microphone (otherwise the mic will pick up what's coming out of the speakers). Get headphones which completely cover your ears rather than in-ear, ipod-style ones, as you want to have as little sound leaking as possible.<br>  Hope this helps and hope you're recording goes well :)

FoIxsunVaa	Um, my answer is not going to make you happy.    I am 49 years old, have never had any children and do not intend to have any children. But the reasons my answer is not going to make you happy are these;    1. I have helped raise about 8 of my 42 nieces and nephews. I had changed more diapers than many actual fathers have by the time I was 20!    2. I work with children. I have changed diapers, and dealt with more kid's issues than I ever would as an actual parent. I work at a homeless shelter.    3. I DO think about having a child someday, despite my strong principles against bring a child into this world. It's unlikely to happen, but I am in no way a poster child for a child-free life.    Frankly, when I think about the children that I know out there in the world, I cringe. So many "bad influences" and so much "bad parenting" have gone into these kids (especially the ones I am related to,) that the world is going down a really dark alley for the foreseeable future.    If I were a woman, despite my principles and the horror with which I hold parents, I would probably have succumbed to the "impulse" by now. The biological desire to pollute the planet with future generations is the most powerful force in the human psyche.|`|AA11564934	has anyone ever gone their whole life without children?

Finished on May 10, 1869 at the famous Golden spike event at Promontory Summit, Utah, it created a nationwide mechanized transportation network that revolutionized the population and economy of the American West, catalyzing the transition from the wagon trains of previous decades to a modern transportation system. Although an accomplishment, it achieved the status of first transcontinental railroad by connecting myriad eastern US railroads to the Pacific and was not the largest single railroad system in the world. The Canadian Grand Trunk Railway (GTR) had, by 1867, already accumulated more than 2,055 km (1,277 miles) of track by connecting Portland, Maine, and the three northern New England states with the Canadian Atlantic provinces west as far as Port Huron, Michigan, through Sarnia, Ontario.<br>  <br>   <br>  Celebration of the meeting of the railroad in Promontory Summit, Utah, in 1869.Authorized by the Pacific Railway Act of 1862 and heavily backed by the federal government, it was the culmination of a decades-long movement to build such a line and was one of the crowning achievements of the presidency of Abraham Lincoln, completed four years after his death. The building of the railroad required enormous feats of engineering and labor in the crossing of plains and high mountains by the Union Pacific Railroad and Central Pacific Railroad, the two federally chartered enterprises that built the line westward and eastward respectively. The building of the railroad was motivated in part to bind the Union together during the strife of the American Civil War. It substantially accelerated the populating of the West by white homesteaders, led to rapid cultivation of new farm lands. The Central Pacific and the Southern Pacific Railroad combined operations in 1870 and formally merged in 1885; the Union Pacific originally bought the Southern Pacific in 1901 and was forced to divest it in 1913, but finally took it over for good in 1996.<br>  <br>  Many Canadian and United States railroads originally used various broad gauges, but most were converted to 4 ft 9 in (1,448 mm) by 1886, when the conversion of much of the southern rail network from 5 ft (1,524 mm) gauge took place, see Broad gauge#United States. This and the standardization of couplings and air brakes enabled the pooling and interchange of locomotives and rolling stock, see Rail gauge in North America.<br>  <br>  The Railroad had its largest impact on the American transportation system during the second half of the 19th century. The conventional historical view has been that the railroads were indispensable to the development of a national market in the United States in the late 19th century. American economic historian Robert Fogel, however, disagrees. In his article entitled: "Railroads and American Economic Growth", Fogel imagines a world in 1890 in which the railroad had never been invented and instead considers a world in which the next best alternatives in transportation were able to develop, such as additional canals and resurfaced roads. He calculates that the railroad contributed to a ~7% increase in GNP when compared to a world without a railroad. Said differently: without the railroad, America's GNP would have been 7.2% less in 1890. While this is the largest contribution to GNP growth made by any single innovation before 1900, this percentage only represents 2-3 years of GNP growth, which is relatively small. The conclusion of Fogel's argument is that the railroads were important but not essential to late 19th century growth in the US. The railway would remain the dominant form of transportation until the invention and production of the automobile.<br>  <br>  Fogel's specific hypothesis is that the primary effect of the invention of the railroad was the resulting social savings from converting from a system based in water and wagon transport to one which used railroads. Switching to railroads served as a means of reducing not only the cost but also the time of transportation, which had important subsequent opportunity cost implications as well. Specifically, one industry in which savings were significantly large was the shipping of agricultural commodities inter-regionally. Fogel calculates that the absence of the railroad would have "doubled the cost of shipping agricultural commodities inter-regionally." [7]<br>  <br>  Much of the actual capital came from Europe—especially Britain and also Dutch and German banks, which purchased large blocks of shares. The Northern Pacific for example, originally financed by Jay Cooke (his bank failed after the Panic of 1873), might not have survived some of its many setbacks without the help of Deutsche Bank. DB held $20 million in NP bonds in 1883, and it was on the road's board until World War I.[8]<br>  The first passenger cars in the resembled stagecoaches. They

OYWqaDtOaa	Read it in Spanish.  A lot is lost in translation (even when a book has a really good translator).  You lose the connotation of many of the words, which can make reading the text a richer experience.  It doesn't matter if you're reading it for fun or for class.  If you're capable of reading well in another language (which is so great and I wish I could) than you should read the book in the original language.  Whatever you choose, have fun!<br>  <br>  Edit: I just looked up the book on wiki to see if I wanted to add it to my to-read list (I do) and I noticed that the translation is supposedly 200 pages shorter than the original, which I find odd.  If this is true, definitely read it in Spanish.  Also, I have read By Night in Chile by the same author in translation.  He's such a rich writer and his nooks seem to be so complex that it seems like it would be better to read without the mediation of a translator.|`|w7USF5wDaa	Spanish, hands down.  Why would you want to read a novel in translation when you could read the original?<br>  <br>  Cheers.|`|v70p2kgWaa	Read it in Spanish<br>  <br>  Always read what you're most comfortable in is my rule of thumb.  Okay so I only speak English, but even in that case I'm not going to try to read Harry Potter in the original British, it would be too confusing for me.  As long as you are reading for pleasure (not to learn/strengthen understanding of a language or for academics), than there really is no point in attempting to keep the integrity of the text by reading it in the original language (though in this case the original is in spanish so that doesn't matter).  The fun is in the good story and you lose that trying to understand what's going on.|`|AA10084471	Spanish, then, of course.<br>  <br>  It was written in Spanish, by a Spanish speaker, and you read Spanish.<br>  <br>  When you read a translated work, you are inevitably reading a collaboration bewteen the author and the translator, at least in terms of the prose.   A great translated work is still a great work (unless the translation is truly horrendous) but if you can read the original, you can read the author's true work.<br>  <br>  P.S.  -- the difference in pages between the English and Spanish language editions is not because things were left out of the translation. Some of it is because the English is shorter, but more because of the formatting used by the publishers.
rmek0hhjaa	You should always bring <br>  A) a resume<br>  B) a headshot and full body shot<br>  C) a list of your 'info'. aka height, weight and hair and eye color, etc.<br>  <br>  Heres an lol story from the 80s<br>  <br>  Be careful what you bring into an audition—you may end up getting yourself into an embarrassing situation. A friend of mine once told me about an embarrassing experience he had auditioning for the Civic Orchestra of Chicago.<br>  <br>  This friend of mine (I did not do this, I swear) had heard about the benefits of bringing a Mini Disc recorder into an audition and recording your playing for future playback. This was in the late 1990s when Mini Discs were the hippest thing since sliced bread. Nowadays people can use their iPod, iRiver, or other such MP3 player to do this, but in the 1990s the Mini Disc was an easy way to get a decent portable digital recording.<br>  <br>  I often did this type of recording for auditions and found it to be very beneficial. I would put the Mini Disc player in my pocket and attach a lapel microphone to my belt. Nobody would notice that I was bringing a recording device in with me, and I learned a lot about my playing in auditions.<br>  <br>  The biggest problem with bringing in a recording device is that it is yet another thing to think about during the audition process. Remembering to turn it on and deciding when to turn it on may not seem like a major detail, but it is one more thing to deal with in the auditionee’s already cluttered and nervous brain.<br>  <br>  Anyway, this friend of mine didn’t own a Mini Disc player but still wanted to try recording his audition, so he bought a microcassette recorder (the kind that were popular in the 1980s—I always messed around with the one my dad owned) and some tapes. These recorders have pretty terrible playback, but they still give you a reasonable indication of your playing. Also, many are small enough to fit in a person’s pocket and be fairly unobtrusive.<br>  <br>  The day before the audition he made sure that the microcassette recorder had fresh batteries and said a few things into the recorder to make sure that it was working. He then rewound the tape so that it would be ready to go for the audition.<br>  <br>  He went in to the audition, which was held behind a screen. Joe Guastefeste, the Chicago Symphony principal bass, was the person who listened to all of the Civic Orchestra bass auditions, and he was behind that screen. My friend started by playing his solo Bach movement. Partway through the movement he realized that he had forgotten to turn on the tape recorder. He finished the movement and reached into his pocket to turn it on.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, the play button was right next to the record button on this microcassette recorder, and he hit play instead. The recorder started to play the test he had done the day before, and what came out was:<br>  <br>  “Hoooooow’s it going??”<br>  <br>  He frantically hit stop but then hit the rewind button, which resulted in some high-pitched tape rewinding sound.<br>  <br>  Imagine for a second what Joe Guastefeste must be thinking. The candidate plays his solo, and then a strange digital voice suddenly says, “How’s it going?” followed by some frantic weird sounds.<br>  <br>  This sort of thing doesn’t do wonders for an auditionee’s mental focus, and the rest of the audition kind of went downhill from there. I would love to have been a fly on the wall for that audition!|`|TJ6KPvaJaa	a headshot... i guess.|`|MQVmh5hiaa	choose izzo as best answer.
7v7oEeA8aa	As with many inventions, the flush toilet did not suddenly spring into existence, but was the result of a long chain of minor improvements. Therefore, instead of a single name and date, there follows a list of significant contributors to the history of the device.<br>  <br>      * circa 26th century BC: Flush toilets were first used in the Indus Valley Civilization. The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flush toilet in almost every house, attached to a sophisticated sewage system. [1]<br>      * circa 18th century BC: Flush toilet constructed at Knossos on Minoan Crete[2]<br>      * circa 15th century BC: Flush toilets used in the Minoan city of Akrotiri.[citation needed]<br>      * 9th century BC: Flush toilets in Bahrain Island.[3]<br>      * 1st to 5th centuries AD: Flush toilets were used throughout the Roman Empire. Some examples include those at Vindolanda on Hadrian's Wall in Britain. With the fall of the Roman Empire, the technology was lost in the West.[citation needed]<br>      * 1596: Sir John Harington published A New Discourse of a Stale Subject, Called the Metamorphosis of Ajax, describing a forerunner to the modern flush toilet. The design had a flush valve to let water out of the tank, and a wash-down design to empty the bowl. He installed one for his godmother Elizabeth I of England at Richmond Palace, although she refused to use it because it made too much noise[citation needed]. The Ajax was not taken up on a wide scale in England, but was adopted in France under the name Angrez.<br>      * 1738: A valve-type flush toilet was invented by J. F. Brondel.<br>      * 1775: Alexander Cummings invented the S-trap (British patent no. 814?), still in use today, which uses standing water to seal the outlet of the bowl, preventing the escape of foul air from the sewer. His design had a sliding valve in the bowl outlet above the trap.<br>      * 1777: Samuel Prosser invented and patented the 'plunger closet'.<br>      * 1778: Joseph Bramah invented a hinged valve or 'crank valve' that sealed the bottom of the bowl, and a float valve system for the flush tank. His design was used mainly on boats.<br>      * 1819: Albert Giblin received British patent 4990 for the "Silent Valveless Water Waste Preventer", a siphon discharge system.<br>      * 1852: J. G. Jennings invented a wash-out design with a shallow pan emptying into an S-trap.<br>      * 1857: The first American patent for a toilet, the 'plunger closet', was granted.<br>      * 1860: The first watercloset installed on the European continent was imported from England. It was installed in the rooms of Queen Victoria in castle Ehrenburg (Coburg, Germany); she was the only one who was allowed to use it.<br>      * The first popularized water closets were exhibited at The Crystal Palace and these became the first public toilets. They had attendants dressed in white and customers were charged a penny for use. This is the origin of the phrase "To spend a penny".<br>      * 1880s: Thomas Crapper's plumbing company built flush toilets of Giblin's design. After the company received a royal warrant, Crapper's name became synonymous with flush toilets. Although he was not the original inventor, Crapper popularized the siphon system for emptying the tank, replacing the earlier floating valve system which was prone to leaks. Some of Crapper's designs were made by Thomas Twyford. The similarity between Crapper's name and the much older word crap is merely a coincidence.<br>      * 1885: Thomas Twyford built the first one-piece china toilet using the flush-out siphon design by J. G. Jennings.<br>      * 1886: An early jet flush toilet was manufactured by the Beaufort Works in Chelsea, England.<br>      * 1906: William Elvis Sloan invents the Flushometer which uses pressurized water directly from the supply line for faster recycle time between flushes. The original Royal Flushometer is still in use today in public restrooms worldwide.<br>      * 1907: Thomas MacAvity Stewart of Saint John, New Brunswick patents the vortex-flushing toilet bowl which creates a self cleansing effect.[4]<br>      * 1980: Bruce Thompson, working for Caroma in Australia, developed the Duoset cistern with two buttons and two flush volumes as a water-saving measure. Modern versions of the Duoset are now available in more than 30 countries worldwide, and save the average household 67% of their normal water usage.[5]|`|550e4912823fee98e745442e7bdab33faa	Thomas Crapper, no kidding.|`|B8Gwxo1laa	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flush_toilet" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flush_toile...</a>|`|6c30b5116a79d741042462d73fcdf99aaa	Sir Thomas Crapper (1836-1910) is credited with improving the functionality of the early flush toilet (water closet), but he did not invent the bathroom appilance from scratch. Credit for that goes to 16th century author Sir John Harrington, who not only came up with the idea, but installed an early working prototype in the palce of Queen Elizabeth I, his gdmother. The first patent for a flushing water closet was issued to Alexander Cummings in 1775.

94cfa83891e50d1d3241b5fad4c4fa4faa	Beginning your exploration with myths and legends is a good place to start, but you might need to narrow in that idea. This idea lends itself to exploration of theme through culture so look for concepts within myths or legends that can be investigated more deeply. As you explore myths and legends you may stumble upon an issue you personally connect with, which would eventually lead to the development of a well conceived series. Computer Graphics is abolutely acceptable for IB art. You will need to show the development of each piece, creating a story board of sorts, that details the steps taken within each completed work. Create small prints of works in progress and reflect on them regulary in terms of their visual quality and technique. Communicate with your teacher--let him/her know of what your are thinking about, they will have good advice for you.

35GfsJ3Paa	If your flute is closed-hole, it's probably a beginning student model. <br>  <br>  Find out how much your flute was new, and also look for similar models on Amazon, Ebay, and several online instrument retailers (like Muncy Winds and Woodwind Brasswind) to see what the same model is selling for right now. Since your flute is used, it will be worth somewhat less.<br>  <br>  Take the flute to an instrument repair person to ensure there are no problems with it before you try to trade it in.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure what company makes the "bliss" clarinet, but student clarinets cost anywhere from $500-$1300 depending on whether you get plastic, imitation wood, or real wood. I recommend Buffet E11 as a good student model that is wood. Avoid buying a plastic or imitation wood clarinet if at all possible.<br>  <br>  What a music shop will give you for your flute depends a quite a bit on the condition, age, and model of your flute as well as the trade-in policy of the store. Shop around - take your flute to several stores and compare their "bids" for how much it is worth.<br>  <br>  Clarinets are generally more expensive than flutes. However, do not buy a clarinet with silver keys - nickle is much less expensive, and there's really no reason to buy one with silver keys.

hl5cZxO2aa	Hawa Mahal (Hindi: ??? ???, translation: Palace of Winds), is a palace in Jaipur, India. It was built in 1799 by Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh, and designed by Lal Chand Usta in the form of the crown of Krishna, the Hindu god. It forms part of the City Palace and extends the Zenana or women's chambers, the chambers of the harem. Its original intention was to allow royal ladies to observe everyday life in the street below without being seen.<br>  It has five stories and is constructed of red and pink sandstone, highlighted with white quakeee quick lime. The side facing the street outside the palace complex has 953 small windows, and the breeze (hawa) which circulates through these windows gives the palace its name, and keeps it cool even in hot months.<br>  The entrance opens onto a courtyard with a double-storied building on three sides, and one on the eastern wing with three more stories, which is just one room wide. There are no stairs to reach the upper floors, only ramps

iNXqiDIYaa	Plot summary<br>  When the eerie performances of a life-size puppet begin to haunt the old Van Pelt estate where an amateur acting group, the Footlighters, have their theatre, Nancy Drew is called upon to unravel the baffling mystery.<br>  <br>  From the moment the pretty detective and her friends Bess and George arrive at the mansion, the dancing puppet puzzle is further complicated by Tammi Whitlock, the Footlighters' temperamental leading lady, and Emmet Calhoun, a Shakespearean actor.<br>  <br>  Nancy's search for clues to the weird mystery begin in the mansion's dark, musty attic, which precipitates a frightening chain of events. A phone call from a stranger with a witchlike, cackling voice warns her to "Get out!" Next, Nancy and her friends venture into a hay loft and find a life-sized puppet of a witch. An encounter with two suspected jewel thieves adds yet another perplexing angle to the puzzle.<br>  <br>  Finally, when Nancy sees the life-sized puppet flitting across the moonlit lawn and chases it, she learns that someone with sinister motive is determined to keep her from solving the case. Is it one of the Footlighters? Or is it an outsider?<br>  <br>  Nancy unwittingly places herself in even greater danger when she is persuaded to perform in the Footlighters' current production.
ceBTTCPwaa	Nancy, Bess and George join the Footlighters, an amateur acting group located at the nearby Van Pelt estate, so that Nancy can investigate sightings of a dancing life-size puppet which has been haunting the grounds of the estate. Personally, I didn't find the mystery in this book to be all that exciting, the puppet wasn't spooky at all and there wasn't much action to be found. The end of the book wasn't very good as the main criminals are arrested well before the book ends and this happens in a typically boring Nancy Drew fashion. However, I was pleasantly surprised to find the book as well written as it was; it certainly is not classic literature, but it was a step up from the atrocious writing found in most of the high (from #35 up) Nancy Drew books. The characters were well-defined and actually had personality, unlike in a lot of the books of the series, where the characters are either good or bad. Isn't wasn't the most exciting book, but at least when I finished it I hadn't felt as though I had just wasted my time.
ShYuIdhbaa	Victor is the true monster because he tries to play the part of god, fails at it, and never once truly accepts the blame. He has let go of human attachments and a calm mind, which as he says, human beings should not do.<br>  "A human being in perfection ought always to preserve a calm and peaceful mind, and never allow passion or a transitory desire to disturb his tranquillity." (Victor -pg. 33 Norton Anthology Edition)<br>  Victor has done the exact opposit of what he says.<br>  <br>  Also, Elizabeth never goes on trial for the murder of William, it is Justine who does and is condemned.  Elizabeth does tesitfy however. In my book it's at the bottom of pg. 52 and continues onto 53 (Norton Anthology Edition).

iHtskXisaa	I don't know about all time, but John Shirley's "Black Butterflies", a collection of short stories, will almost certainly fit the bill.  This is the only book I've ever read which actually freaked me out.  There are two or three pieces in there that are actually hard to finish, they're so frightening.  I think it's out of print, so it might be hard to find, but everyone I know who has read it loved it.  (Of course, like me, they're also horror-loving, sick individuals.)    I'll also point out that besides being horrifying, it's also sexually graphic in places and pretty much shatters every human taboo.

5liN3A1laa	Dragon, the Solidus didn't come about until the fiscal reforms of Diocletion in AD 301.    Recognizing that it's hard to determine accurate exchange rates between ancient Rome and today, my first guess would be that the Aureus is the coin in question.  It was a gold coin valued at about 25 Denarius.  The Denarius was probably equivalent to a days wage for a skilled laborer back in the day.|`|AA10729675	Look under sesterce on Google.

qyqxp4abaa	The skipper was his boss, his mentor and a father figure, by far the most significant and least complicated of Gilligan's relationships with the other castaways.    Let's examine the others:     First of all, I think we can eliminate Mrs. Howell.  Except for brief consideration of adopting him as an heir, she treated him much like the servants she knew back home, condescendingly and without affection.  However, in real life, (according to Russell Johnson's book) she was a wonderful lady.    Ginger, seductive, but shallow; not a deep thought beneath her makeup and wigs; a perfect bimbo.  More than Lovey Howell, she used Gilligan to advance her own little schemes, again, without showing any real appreciation.    Mr. Howell.  Now we get into a more complex relationship.  Thurston Howell may really have felt a paternal relationship with Gilligan, though constantly in competition with and subordinate to the Skipper.  Gilligan may be the one thing (besides escape from the island) that his fortune counldn't buy.    And the rest...    The Professor was someone that Gilligan looked up to, not so much as a father figure, but as the man he'd like to be if ever he could reach manhood.  He was admired, respected, and above all, his resourcefulness enabled the castaways to survive and represented their greatest hope for finding a way back home.    ...and then there was Maryann.  Although there was only one episode devoted to the potential for a romantic relationship between Gilligan and Maryann, the sexual tension between the two was evident from the start, and a key element in sustaining the show for three seasons.  The choice of characters limited coupling options on the island, and these two were the youngest and most likely candidates to carry on their island civilization and breed a new generation were the rest of mankind to be annihiliated (remember this was set against a cold war backdrop).  You knew Maryann would fall for Gilligan if he displayed the least little bit of interest in her, but the manchild was preoccupied with the idle wanderings of youth and never outgrew his boyhood.  Given this tension, complexity and potential, I would have to rank the relationships in this order:    1. Skipper  2. Maryann  3. Professor  4. Mr Howell  5. Ginger  6. Mrs Howell    * to Nancy T: Literary archetypes appear in many forms and are throughout various artistic media. The captive, insular society of Gilligan's Island expanded the characterizations of Golding's Lord of the Flies.  Although Littlemonster didn't mention this in the question, I'm sure this was just an oversight, and their intent was to stimulate discussion on the extent to which Gilligan's Island completed a desert island trilogy and no doubt prompted many young viewers to explore this theme further by reading William Golding and Daniel Defoe.    It was inevitable that the Emmy award voters would be naive to the intellectual depth of Sherwood Schwartz's creation and Gilligan's Island regarded at best as benign farce and more likely casting it away as residing at the nadir of television programming.|`|g4AAZRuxaa	The professor and the Captain or I mean the skipper, Mary ann also.|`|UoGFo3Dhaa	He lived with the Skipper.  They talked every night before falling asleep.  During the day he worked with the Skipper or the Professor.    These were his two most significant relationships.    The girls were always trying to trick him into doing something.  Mr Howell would always assign Gilligan some manual labor type task to do.    Gilligan had the Island named after him.  He pretty much got all the dirty jobs though.|`|hQ95u9OLaa	The Skipper and Ginger. Because the Skipper was his boss and Ginger was always trying to teach him about the fairer sex. Besides Tina Louise was supposed to be the start of Gilligan's Island but Bob Denver beat her out for popularity.|`|vmmMqhxXaa	The Skipper and Mary Ann.  I would label the Skipper as a surrogate father (note how he called Gilligan his "little buddy," and alternately scolded and praised him).  Mary Ann was a platonic friend.  She was sweet and nonthreatening, and she treated Gilligan as an equal -- at least, more than the others did.|`|YNbgnZD2aa	Why is this question under "Books and Authors"?|`|iXhnRPb2aa	mary ann because she was the only other one who didnt have a real title, or impressve reason to be alive.  the skipper because he was just as much of an idiot as gilligan was

FNwYzjogaa	Please remember that this is a critique not a personal insult. None of this is meant to be taken personally.     Your story is filled with unnecessary and annoying details like the in depth description of the pancake eating, the crash game, the dusty computer, the trampoline etc etc. All of those things could have been removed because they add nothing to the story. You do not need so much detail for every little thing. You mention them but you do not need to describe them so much. It makes me feel like i am reading on of those log books where the person describes every little detail of their day.      Your writing style is very clunky and awkward. It's not fluid so it makes the story difficult to read. Part of this is because of all the spelling and grammar mistakes you made. You really need someone to proof read this for you so they can help you fix those. One big one I noticed was its instead of it's; it's means it is while its is the possessive form of it. Another way to solve this is by working on your sentence structure. A lot of your sentences are either very short and useless or far too long and run-ons.     Your characters are a little annoying. The best friend is very Mary Sueish at the moment but that could be fixed with some editing. He needs some sort of flaw. He is sweet but he needs something that will make him seem more realistic.     The mother is very annoying because she doesn't behave like a mother. She screams abusive or in an abusive relationship. She seems to go from a very wishy washy woman to a very angry one. She calls her daughter for stupid for startling her. She doesn't talk like a mother either. She speaks like a teenager as do almost all of your other characters.     The main character is also very annoying. She is obviously pretty, her picture makes that very clear so she needs to stop calling herself ugly. She looks fine so why have her say otherwise. Self hate is never something you should teach. If she wants to call herself ugly, give her a lime green mullet, a beard, and some horrible boils otherwise she needs to get over it. She also needs some sort of flaw besides thinking she is ugly. Her powerlessness sets her apart from her peers but I have a feeling that she will end up with a healing power or learn to love the fact that she is powerless so I am not considering that an actual flaw. She needs a real character flaw.     At the moment your story has potential, the powers seem to be creative and the world could really be unique, but you need to work on it.|`|WFl6ErDMaa	Gripping ;D    I really liked it!

1urLjIUBaa	I haven't read James Patterson, so I really couldn't say. I am a great admirer of Michael Crichton.

I love his work.|`|654c7643984cd6b3f7f0f00356056e81aa	Hhmmm....Well, I love them both, but I would have to say the late Michael Crichton...because he was so creative in so many genres...science fiction, medical thrillers, movie screenplays, television series (created E.R.)...PLUS, he was a medical doctor...James Patterson is good, but he is good for a very formulamatic crime novel or a sappy love story, unless he collaborates with someone else!

Buddha   500 BC|`|ZwECcnh1aa	Its because of the ego. People pursue more money so they can feel better about themselves. They are never satisfied with what they have, regardless of what it is, so they keep chasing some future goal. Human nature has ways of manifesting itself, even in the most peaceful civilisations. Greed, anger and violence will always be a part of us.|`|07fd7ea1dbff60f8707ba40041258bc9aa	Education has a point, many of these so called founding fathers of modern philosophy.  Plato wrote "The kindling of a flame, not the filling of a vessel" about Socrates.  Aristotle said education was an ornament in prosperity and a refuge in adversity, as well as the best provision for old age.  Can the pursuit knowledge be greed, in truth if knowledge and happiness co exist, helping others in their personal quest for understanding and finding organisation is the best way of making progress.|`|4s1PX9cmaa	there is no point.|`|Uv3h61t9aa	I am guessing that without the organization, such a world would be very chaotic.    Then again the world is already chaotic.    You'll see that somehow and someday, the shift of human consciousness will appear and the world will change dramatically.    And... what the first person said exactly.|`|HbtWJPzuaa	it is exactly what you said - happiness.  we invent printers and are organized and stressed out because it is part of our pursuit of happiness|`|zwXD3iH1aa	The point of going to college and success is to do what you want to career wise.  To do what you want is to be happy.    It is an impossibility to just "live off the land" and "not be greedy".  This is connected to why we are so organized: social standards and hierarchies.  If we did not have our current social standards we would inevitably create some due to egos vying for power.  If we create one world sovereign we would have one person or group of people dictating what is good for us.  More than likely there would be continued oppression on multiple levels.  Not much changes when you get a new form of government or religion.  People will still be stressed or depressed.    I doubt if we would evolve into happier people with what you are suggesting.  People are selfish.  The root of everything that we do is because of this selfishness--we help others because we want to--it makes us happy.|`|FoIxsunVaa	Happiness is an emotion, it comes and goes. Trying to be "happy" all the time is like trying to make the sun stay at NOON. If you succeeded, the solar system would collapse!    The 'land" as you call it cannot sustain half the current population, so whom would you like to KILL so we can become agrarian again?    Religion, nationhood and greed have made it possible for this world to sustain billions of people, who can all go around working, going to school, and when they are not CONTRIBUTING TO OUR MUTUAL survival, maybe seek out a little happiness.    When most of the world is starving, at war and in desperate poverty, the gall of those who sit on a pile of wealth (American lifestyle) and say "why do I have to go to college?" just shocks and appalls me.    We are the luckiest two people on the planet Earth, and you can't understand why we have to study, work and contribute.    Fcuk John Lennon and world peace. Do something for REAL. Get good grades, work hard and MAKE YOUR OWN environment a better place.|`|KvyB0E77aa	Actually you miss the point completely.  We don't go to college to make money. We go to college to learn and then use our intelligence to make a better world. If you can make money while doing that there is nothing wrong with it.  The person who invented the printer helped the world better communicate. That translates to sharing thoughts on everything from medical discoveries to save people to writing books to entertain. All wonderful.  Greed can exist in any circumstance including communal living off the land.|`|v6mQzSSbaa	Exactly what the first person said|`|zxhppf3Caa	Well.  The answer you'll accept depends on your maturity level. I'm going to assume that you are 17-20 years old.  So:  1. The point of college is to enrich yourself- to discover your passion and pursue it.  Higher education should not be about picking the major that will be the most financially lucrative. It is about nurturing your intellect.  If everyone went to college for that reason, maybe there would be less greed and more love.    2. Why can't we, as you so eloquently put it, "just do stuff like live off the land"?  Because in order to live off the land, one is required to have the proper knowledge, work ethic, and ambition to care for said land.  Do you have any idea how much work farming is? And talk about stress when the weather doesn't cooperate with your planting/harvest times, or when there are floods.    I like your idea of simplicity and happy living, but in order to reach that lofty of a goal, you need an education.|`|zzO6Qalsaa	You know in the end I believe your point comes down to us as an individual."What do you want to do?" What can you do?Will you have to work till you can live off the land?To at least own a place big enough to grow a few  crops.I know no where they are giving land away sadly!Also the way society is set up you have to have a currency of some form to buy even the minimum goods.
Xc02z608aa	If you want to write then write, but the idea must come from you.  The idea must be something that interests you.  Real writers don't ask random people on the internet to give them ideas.|`|LzPhdri5aa	Brainstorming is an exercise in creativity in which you write down as many ideas as you can think of in 20 minutes.  Don't second guess it.  Don't think about it, just write the answers down.    Then go through the list and determine the ones that you might actually ENJOY writing about.  Eliminate the ones you don't.  Then prioritize the ones that you do and write the one at the top of the list.|`|YhjTbSmDaa	Something that comes from your imagination.    Ideas coming from someone else probably limits your originality.    Start with any idea, anything- even if the idea sounds stupid.    Start with your idea, add to it, add off of it. Add characters, add different surroundings.    Once you evolve a stupid idea, it can become a really great one.|`|fCvc1LLEaa	You want to "one day" publish a book. . . using my idea?      You can't be a writer if you can't do any of the following:    - come up with an idea, and SELL it to the readers(Make it believable by pulling the readers into that made up world)    - write well|`|irIk1saFaa	If you want to write a good book, it should be about something that you either are interested in or know.|`|xtCVTUKBaa	Write about something you know, or would like to know. Pick a genre that you like to read.|`|5478d54ea53fcef0ef93502a7e237c89aa	People who really write books don't ask other people (especially not a bunch of strangers on the internet) for their ideas.  If you don't have one of your own, forget about it.|`|wQeCtj0uaa	let it be about something that no one has ever thought about. and once its published one day, everyone will love it.|`|IKrYf7Y6aa	Try writing about your own experiences.|`|BZGeCbPKaa	Racism in the south.

The odd thing though about me is i normally just wright down random ideas that i might want to add to the story, like a fight scene before i even write it or a death before the the main characters meet. I write what hits me first as for a theme, like something no one has done yet or something not a lot of people have written about. That's what i normally do.|`|FSe19uT6aa	What genre of books do you like to read? Start there.

cbKbsXXyaa	We are by evolutionary nature selfish.  Selfishness survives.  To be truly selfless you have to be that which is not human.  An example.  You see an old lady walking across a street and you help her out.  Why did you do this deed?  Was it for the good of humanity?  Or was it to possibly curry favor with this particular person?  Was it to make yourself feel better about your morals?|`|zzO6Qalsaa	Well true there is a lot of pro`s and con`s to your statement and yes maybe most people are selfish by nature.Then again what of us that give blood and plasma to Red Cross? I have been doing it for 10 years and don't do it to be recognized or to consider myself a hero.I do it never knowing where my blood or plasma will go,I only hope it helps someone somewhere.|`|bOaqWNxRaa	Complete altruism doesn't exist. We all do things, even things that would appear to be in the name of charity, for a future reward. It's part of the human condition.     But if we're all selfish at our cores, why should selfishness be frowned upon?|`|3d7413e991732aa7cbba574864c37217aa	Well, even "selfless" acts are selfish as long as they are willful, by the definition of will. But this is misleading. I think it's our nature to have to consider the interests of others, since we naturally live interdependently with one another. Sometimes, a person can choose willfully to act in a way that benefits others when the alternative might have benefited him/herself more -- and we say it's selflessness because it's moral (good for society / the species); but of course that person had to have some interest in the action too, if only to be considered more moral or selfless. All acts are willed; selfishness is just a term we use when we want to seem to explain why someone acting in his/her own interest acted in a way that harmed someone else.|`|e3LfwDLyaa	Yeah. Actually, every single organism is. Genes are passed down to our children and so on, so the genes that survived were the selfish ones and the rest died off because they were too busy helping out the selfish ones.  However, what makes us special is that we can actually break that vicious cycle because our reasoning allows us to do it.  For example, when you see a homeless person asking for money, do you give that person any money or food so it can make you feel better? No, of course not. Or how about a person who volunteers at an elderly center or a youth program? Yeah these people may like it, but the reality is that they are not doing this to improve their chances of "survival" (like evolutionists put it) or to raise to fame, it's simply to help others.  To put things in a nut shell, humans are naturally selfish, but our culture and other influences help us break that characteristic since we can now "tell what's right from wrong."|`|w2qV8WEmaa	Selfishness is nature. Every living thing are build to be selfish so that the chances for survival will be higher. The more selfish you are, the highest chance that you will survive.    Selflessness is going against our nature. Selfless people are seen as people, who have overcome their nature. That is why selfless people are admired because nature is a very powerful forces.    Human are the only creature on Earth that have the ability to conquer nature -> selfishness, greed, lust, envy etc.

FoIxsunVaa	When the holocaust victims came to the gates of Heaven, St. Peter looked at their pains and woes and said, "you will have to leave those behind in here."    They had a choice between FORGETTING the PAST or not going into heaven. Most chose NOT going into heaven because to wipe away past pain and misery as if it never happened is to ABANDON that person (back then) to their fate.    The belief that everybody ought to be happy is the IMPULSE THAT ALLOWS THE CONCENTRATION CAMPS AND GENOCIDE.    Why should I be happy when my country is killing innocent people? I hear a lot of Americans screaming about Israel and the Gaza, but where is their anger about OUR OWN ACTS?    being unhappy is the RIGHT choice in many situations.    Pollyannaism KILLS.|`|145RUNQHaa	Misreable people are that way because they have a chip on their shoulder and they want to give everyone else one.|`|azdw8fMlaa	I think that some people feel that happiness comes from what life hands you and not what you bring to it. Some people may enjoy the sympathy for having a "hard life" rather than trying to make it better themselves.|`|eGh9HLXcaa	I think some people are constantly feeling unhappy because they want others to pity them and offer them their sympathies and attention. Because, how can anyone 'love' to be unhappy? Well, unless he or she is sadomasochistic. Anyway, I do not know for sure because I'm not like that. But perhaps these people they are afraid to seek their own happiness because they are afraid of failing to find that and facing the possibility of becoming even more miserable after being let down. Or the person didn't want to have too high a hope towards life because he has been disappointed plently of times and had lost hope towards the possibility of ever becoming happy.|`|010478ea090db9976afeb8170939dea9aa	It may be a fear of all good things come to an end. Like you won't be disappointed if you don't have high expectations. And for some people it may be a result of drugs or alcohol abuse. And for some it may just be how they are.|`|2e2f438d78517ad777fa3313fb112873aa	Since misery often attracts the pity and attention of others, and since some people love to be pitied and have attention it seems to follow that some people will love to be miserable (as a means to something else: the attention they get from it).|`|k3uh0oTAaa	Maybe because being miserable is their comfort zones.  If they've grown up with a lot of people around them being miserable, it would seem to bizarre to them to suddenly be happy all the time.  At least it could be that.  I really don't know though.|`|zFYwMdCvaa	Most miserable people have negative thought patterns which can contribute to the onset and maintenance of a depressive episode in their lives. Their pessimistic outlook leads them to magnify bad experiences and minimize good ones.  Studies indicate that miserable individuals frequently have a depressive attributional style which over exaggerates negative consequences, places blame solely on the individual, and believe a failure in one area of competence can affect behavior in other areas that leads into Depression ans is linked with a negative, pessimistic way of explaining and interpreting failures.     Why do miserable people tend to want others to be as miserable as they are? Misery loves company as my mom always said. Empathy.    Just be happy and be positive and accept the things that you can't control and are out of your control.
gq5sfgE5aa	Yeah, mostly girls love Twilight...guys either read it, love it and don't admit it. They read it love it share it and get laughed at or they just don't read it at all.

Well at my school anyways.|`|0JERmAslaa	dude im a guy and i loved the twilight seris. it was awesome|`|AA10407839	Yeah mostly girls cuz i think guys are too embarrased to try it because of that or some may just not want to admit it. Although both my brothers are reading the books now and quite a few of their friends.

E28mQDX0aa	You don't necessarily have to read them in order, but I would definitely recommend that you do especially since the first one basically introduces you to the world J.R. Ward has created.

ikBZvcGAaa	Its easier to start off making mixes so you can establish your name, thats what im doing. During your spare time with making mixes you can mess around with programs like Audacity and Fruity Loops to learn how to make your own remixes and at some point how to make your own songs. Right now im saving up for a keyboard so i can start making songs. Basically, if your just gonna make music you need a keyboard and a good djing program on the computer. If you wanna play sets at parties your gonna need a booth and speakers Ill come back later if i can find you a good setup, but youre probably gonna spend around 500 dollars.

um2KrDAsaa	Depending on your school, there are probably other ways to earn your performing arts credit.  If you enjoy art, you could take an art class.  Drama or theater are also considered a performing art.  Singing or writing your own songs are definately not the only option.|`|7VpDEkC6aa	I would kinda doubt the songwriting thing. I don't think any human being would be able to take the kind of ear abuse as a teacher to have to listen to 30 original songs by freshmen. UgGGH!  I get the shivers just thinking about how bad that could be.   I Scared myself!! Brrrrr.    LOL    The other person is right. Performing arts could be Jazz dance, or Drama class, My school had a little TV studio so you could take a TV production class.   I took Drama, TV production and Barbershop choir back in the 70's    There are also many choir type classes. I don't think any of them really focus on "solo" singing.
cfda9b5d078d37da24e0ff1809dee8d5aa	One of his borther's descendents recently claimed that Houdini was poisoned by Spiritualists who would upset about his exposition of their secrets.    However one of his wife's descendents blocked the request to exhume Houdini's body and test it for poison.    As to the "punch in the stomach" account, that's likely a myth too.  The most likely explanation is that Houdini had an inflamed appendix which he ignored due to a high pain threshold and a dislike of doctors.  Eventually the appendix burst (whether from the alleged punch or not) and cause peritonitis, which is what killed him.|`|9Asy21leaa	J. Gordon Whitehead had accidently killed him, Houdini was reclining on his couch after his performance, having an art student sketch him. When Whitehead came in and asked if it was true that Houdini could take any blow to the stomach, Houdini replied groggily in the affirmative. In this instance, he was hit three times, before Houdini could tighten up his stomach muscles, to avoid serious injury. Whitehead reportedly continued hitting Houdini several times afterwards, and Houdini acted as though he were in some pain.|`|wnkoTEqVaa	No what happened was that he could get punched in the stomach and not get hurt. Someone punched him when he was not ready and it damaged his appendix. He died three days later because Houdini did not go to the hospital but did three magic shows. His death was an accident.

Ahud6tPZaa	Headshots - make sure they're done by a professional.    If your resume's empty, why take one? In fact, if it's empty, you're unlikely to get very far.    Too many people think that acting is just about saying lines and having fun. It's not. It's a lot of hard work, and there's a lot of stuff you have to prepare, and know how to prepare, in order to play a role.|`|g4rDDsVwaa	I got a paying job once when I showed up for what I thought were open auditions, but turned out to be callbacks.  If they like your 'look' and/or your talent, being unprepared may not hurt you.  However, even people with tons of experience, great headshots, and a killer monologue may not get cast if they aren't what the director is looking for.  You have nothing to lose by showing up and trying.|`|6pevwBizaa	They have to REALLY like you. An agent would help, but no you do not need one. Honestly, give it a shot. You never know. Good luck!|`|cb5cb44a2fed0fb2497e1f4a938b8bffaa	chances are tough especially if it's a cattle call audition. Directors are often looking for any reason to send people away when they have a lot of auditions.  I once heard of a situation where a director chose not to cast someone because they looked like one of her ex boyfriends from high school.  My advice to you bring your headshots. Bring your resume. Do a damn good job and if they give you a call back then make sure you wear the same outfit you wore to the initial audition.  Everyone has a resume like that at some point. You just need a chance. Go for it.|`|65e2bb08e7a66fd77d93adfb0c9b8888aa	How would you know about the audition in the first place?  The way professional auditions are held is: The casting people submit the breakdowns to the agencies.  The agencies submit their clients.

It is called creativity...|`|mMnRmYvNaa	Within reason, yes.    Holocaust deniers and Global Warming deniers are questioning but in an unreasonable way.    No amount of information would be adequate to convince them. They hold that their own personal opinion based on getting through High School, in some little town, down in the hollers, is just as good, actually better than the opinion 10,000 historians who affirm that the Holocaust did occur (not including some Catholic Bishops, recently re-instated by the Ratsinger Pope). Global warming deniers are ready to put their views up against 10,000 Ph.D. scientists who stand behind the International Panel on Climate Change -- many of whom have devoted their entire lives to gathering data and doing fieldwork.    Also among the unreasonable questioners I would have to put those who deny deep time, deny evolution, and deny the Earth being more the 6000 years old.     There's nothing that should always be done, except maybe to respect other people and treat them as decently as you can. So questioning what you learn -- yes do that a lot -- but not always -- don't be unreasonable. Not questioning what you learn -- don't do that all the time -- but sometimes that's the way to go, if you want to be guided by reason, and not GOP small-timey "saved" person superstition and shibboleth -- if you're not a coal miner's daughter, you don't have an excuse to be so unworldly that you deny basic facts.     If you are a coal miner's daughter, no disrespect intended, but if your idea of the celestial motions is Pre-Copernican, at least you have an excuse, especially in USA where our educational system is so deplorable -- we come in what 39th -- behind Albania and Portugal -- we -- the richest nation on Earth.     Anyhow, if you live in the hollers, it's not your fault -- what you don't know. But if you live anywhere else, then be a reasonable questioner and not a "saved person" GOP propagandist, who disingenuously and vexaciously questions everything that's not taught by Rush Limbaugh, or in Church.|`|9CHjZ8sBaa	Its the basis of all learning and it helps build on mankinds ideas, inventions and perspectives.

1e4622c41080edcef755ae0f3f517e48aa	Colour exists in your brain, not in the real world.  Just like sweetness and pain and many other sensations.  This is demonstrable through neurology:  people can be caused to see colour by stimulating sections of their brain, and some people with brain damage will see a single apple as many different hues instead of the 'red' most of the rest of us see.  Our brain is handling and modifying information that our eyes receive, though most of us are unaware of this.    The information that your eyes receive, of course, has to do with light frequencies.  And while it's true that there is no light in a dark room, again, that doesn't mean you can't have sensations of colour.  Ask anyone whose experimented with certain kinds of drugs or spent enough time in a sensory deprivation tank.  Without input, the brain often starts just making up stuff.  Some neurologists suspect that in a way waking life is just a dream that is constrained by our senses.    Something interesting to think about.|`|FoIxsunVaa	The causes of color can be measured in other ways, but by definitions color is a visual effect. No light, no sight.|`|3buQDaRDaa	As long as the properties that make it red aren't changed, it is red. The absence of light doesn't make it a different color.

Your question is just a variant on the old question about the tree falling in the forest.|`|cbKbsXXyaa	No, color is produced by light.  So no light = no color.|`|O21HKWAJaa	No because color is a reflection of light|`|4dIWZCLGaa	I had a science teacher who told me that the things we see are light reflections, so when we see something green, it's not green.|`|ZKQgAtBsaa	Color is the light reflected off an object, and in the absence of light, there is no color.|`|8ZcGDTzOaa	It's still a "red sweater" because red refers to the color it is when most people see it.

Omu7AbmQaa	I don't think it was bad at all! It's an amazing series in my opinion. It's such an incredible storyline and you fall in love with the characters.  I do agree that it is rather long and though that can be annoying at times, it enables you to become extremely connected with the characters because you know everything about them.    And there is not even a hint of subliminal messages...its just a fantasy novel. Nothing subliminal about it. Its just like any other make-believe book. It's technically a childrens's book and like any children's story, it has a moral and lesson, but it's not telling you to do anything. I've never heard that before and I must say I completely disagree with your friend. But that's just my opinion.  You should read it and decide for yourself :)|`|lHFWke4Baa	Do you mean bad as in content?

e07d666448c6e75d1b738618c152ff50aa	Prior to the invention of steam powered machinery in the 1800's, the majority of work had to be done by people using hand tools. This goes all the way back to ancient history. If you could force someone to work, it was done because there was no other way. Whenever people invent something to take the place of a person doing the work, people are no longer needed.    Slavery was intended to give those with power a work force. Now we have machines.|`|TPVvddHWaa	At one time almost every society took slaves. These were persons captured during wars and taken back and used as free labour.    Or they were the local people who had been conquered and the invaders used them as such.    Only recently has there been machines to do much of the repetitive labour intensive jobs.     Where slavery did not appear to exist, it still went on, with the class system, common in most societies the lowest were tied to the land owner.     Money was not used as we know it today, people were glad to work for their keep.

gAWWyDLhaa	First, write your story.    Edit your book several times to make it the best it can be, type it in proper manuscript form (visit http://www.writersdigest.com to find out what is needed), consider joining a local writer's group to get feedback from other would-be writers, and get it proofread by someone who knows what they are doing (don't rely just on spellcheck). Edit it some more.    There are a tiny number of publishers that accept unsolicited manuscripts (those that don't go through a literary agent), so getting an agent first is a really good idea.    At the library or bookstore is Guide to Literary Agents, published by Writer's Digest, or Bowker's Literary Marketplace (or visit http://www.agentquery.com). Look for agents that specialize in your genre, and are looking for new clients. Read, and follow, their submission guidelines. In those books will be something about writing a query letter, which is what you send to the agent, first. It's part synopsis of your book, and part explanation as to why your book deserves to be published. You have only that one-page letter to wow the agent, so take the time to make it a good one. Expect the whole process to take lots of time, and expect many rejections. When you are accepted by an agent, they will send your book to publishers, not you. The whole process is free, except for postage, until your book is bought by a publisher. That is when the agent gets their cut (usually 15%) of the money which would go to you.     Good luck!|`|OjQxKGC0aa	Buy a copy of the Children's Writer's & Illustrator's Market for 2009.

5SCFTXAsaa	Hi. It can't hurt to take a look at alto singers first. This way you can decide who you like, before trying to test yourself on hundreds of songs that you don't even know who sing!    So, a few good alto singers...(Certainly in no specific order)    Pop Culture:  Hilary McRae  Avril Lavigne  Miley Cyrus  Lacey Mosley (FlyLeaf)  Cher    Broadway:  Barbara Streisand  Glenn Close  Patti Lupone    Ska:  Street Light Manifesto (Weird choice, I know, but oddly enough the voice parts in this constantly verge on the alto to tenor range; plus they're fun to sing along with. Crazy fast lyrics!)    And just to make this legitimate, ere's a couple awesome alto songs  1.Do you believe in magic  2. Underneath it all (No Doubt)  3. Watch it Crash (SLM)    So, I hope that helps. This, obviously, is by no means an extensive list. Keep googling and ask your friends what female singers they like. Most of them are altos today anyway. Happy Karaokeying?!

1xcfGHCNaa	I enjoy writing poems about life. how you might see the world in a different way than others see it. Or death as well. how do you feel about it. write about a struggle that you went through. flowers is kind of overdone. maybe the night sky, the moon, trees are interesting. You could write about music, or words, or feelings.I find it write about pleasant things. Its usually easier to write more depressing poems because thats the part of us that is trying to get out. But be very descriptive and let us feel what you are feeling. It doesn't matter what you write about, its the meaning behind what you write about.|`|M3k9GOSsaa	-Your favorite thing: bracelet, blanket and feelings or stories behind them  -Someplace (real or imaginary) that you want to be or go  -Tell a funny or weird story in poem-form  -Explain how a certain fruit tastes (sweet, sensual, toe-curling)  -Write about the time you felt your worst/best and why  -Describe your favorite painting    The possibilities are endless. Flowers are great, but which is your favorite, why? Compare it to something outstretched... sunflowers to yellow buses, rose to rusting pipes. Something odd. Keep it true to you though!|`|v6CyvHLyaa	Nudebranch?|`|nslIX6CZaa	Thats the thing with poems, you can write about anything. Remember a poem doesn't have to rhyme. So you could write a completely random poem about the bunch of gardening tools and if you word it in a certain way, you could have people reading it over and over again trying to figure out what the poem is about. Just look at something random and start writing about it.|`|WA80AAipaa	How about a poem about the Miracle on the Hudson
ppR5kH4Yaa	Okay now, if your ancestors were really Native but not proud of it, they were probably not enrolled.  If they were not enrolled you cannot be enrolled.  If you are not enrolled you have no rights to anything that is intended for Native people.  These rights are for enrolled tribal members/citizens of US Federally Recognized Tribes ONLY!    If your ancestors really were Native and were enrolled, burning papers will not make it go away.  Tribal governments keep track of their enrolled members/citizens.  You'd have to 1) know which tribe they were enrolled in and 2) contact that tribe directly.  Even if your ancestors were enrolled you may still not be eligible for enrollment.  That decision is left up to the tribe.  However, most tribes do not look to kindly on those who left when things got tough or their descendants, especially when they come looking for a hand out.  (Think The Little Red Hen...If you or your ancestors didn't help out with the work, you get none of the rewards.)
9adfd40573a5f8454356f9c074106d83aa	Well, until I got to the last word of the next to last line, I was willing to help.  Headshops are the pits of torch glassblowing and hardly a very good future.  Glassblowing in general does not make a bunch of money and flirting with police raids won't help.  If you insist, go to www.hotglass.com  You are highly unlikely to find any classes in Idaho.|`|xopIi2Vfaa	you first need to figure out whether you want to learn lampworking or glass blowing. Look up on wikipedia what each is.   Usually artisans don't take apprentices. It's much too time consuming to teach and they don't get by far enough work out of you to make up for the extra time they use. Most artisans are on a pretty tight budget, so time is indeed money.  You are not going to be rich and you will have to invest quite some amount of money into your training. Glass is not cheap and particularly glass blowing equipment isn't cheap either. Also you cannot do much with glass blowing on your own, you need somebody reasonable experienced to work with.    And it's not bashing you to tell you to be realistic and that you will have to work very hard at it if you really want to make it go.

rT22hTL0aa	I don't know the area.  (I'm in Virginia).  However, for cheap lessons look to the universities.  If there is a college/university near you that has a music program you can probably find a college vocal student who will give lessons at a much lower price than your standard teachers.  Other than that, there's always the phone book -- while you may not find teachers directly there, you can look up music instrument stores as they often have lists of teachers in the area (and may have teachers at their store).  These lessons generally run from $50 a month up towards a $100 a month (the school I teach out of charges $80 month for 1/2 lesson (one on one) once a week).
0ve51pW9aa	The founding fathers of the US were very much opposed to the idea of direct democracy, as it imposes the will of the majority while stepping on the rights of a minority. The only real example of direct democracy in the US are referendums and ballot measures and these are only at the state level, there is no direct democracy on the Federal level.     I'm not sure which state was the first to have these things, but in 1912 the Supreme Court upheld their validity in "Pacific States Telephone and Telegraph Co. vs. Oregon".

cD9fLqe6aa	Hmmm...sounds kind of like The Giver, but it's a nice plot.    It flits around a bit too much, like one second you're talking abt the guy in the boat, the next you're describing the bicycles.    On and on I rode, for about 20 minutes, when all of a sudden I heard the speakers crackle with excitement above my head. The speakers never turned on. In fact, they had only been turned on twice in my lifetime. Twice in sixteen years. The first time they were turned on was when a community member left on his newly-made boat. The second time was when that same community members body washed up on shore. I suspected it would happen. After all, it was a very tiny wooden boat. A funeral was held the day after. The community was buzzing with silly thoughts and opinions, Poor man, and, He deserved it. He did a foolish thing, leaving the island, and he paid. He knew there wasnt anything else out there. The people suspected there were just a few other islands besides our own. They figured they were probably the same or very similar to ours. At least, thats what they thought until the Brightens came.  I waited patiently to hear what the speakers had to say. It took a long time for them to start functioning properly after being turned on because they werent used very often. While waiting, boys who looked to be about my age stopped pedaling their bicycles and held down the brakes so their bikes would cease next to mine. Their bikes gleamed next to mine. Although all of our bicycles look the same, I hadnt had time to wash mine since I had gotten it.    that whole part seems sort of oddly put-together. I think you should get rid of the bicycle-washing part unless it is a very important part of the plot, because it seems unnecessary.     I like the desribing in the beginning, except for the adjective "oh-so" never liked it.|`|TofmqjUaaa	I think its amazing.. keep writing.|`|R5zUR0Y7aa	i love the first few paragraphs....i think the story really starts to unfold and you've got the while former USSR thing going for the plot-line which has endless possibilities and hopefully an interesting outcome .........  but the very first line i think could be better phrased.......i know what you were trying to imply. but i think it could be done with a little more impact and punch.   but keep on it......
eezP5wQ2aa	...not impossible...definitely impossible to do...good luck...|`|1e4622c41080edcef755ae0f3f517e48aa	Well, let's think of this as expansively as possible.    Scientists are working on overcoming many of the obstacles of age, and perhaps with some development of stem cells, growing artificial organs, and so on a person might be ageless.  That's not implausible at all.  But such a person would still be vulnerable to injuries that destroy the brain or the whole person altogether.  So that's not far enough.    We might imagine other systems.  It is conceivable that an advanced enough computer system might be able to store not only your DNA as they can now, but perhaps your entire neural architecture (which is not determined by your DNA, by the way).  If we knew all that, it's possible that even if the entire original you was annihilated, we might be able to construct a new you from scratch.  Or we could do it even if you hadn't been annihilated.    But now we run into a classic philosophy issue:  the Ship of Theseus Problem.  Suppose we do produce another you... is that still you?  What if we produce two... which, then, is the REAL one?  Both?  This is a question that science can't answer and is largely unresolved in philosophy as well.    If we accept, though, that copies (and maybe even computer simulations) of you are still you, though, we might distribute those copies throughout the world and perhaps throughout the universe and you would become immune to any kind of disaster that could effect less than all of the copies.    Which is still pretty close to what you're asking for... but not ENTIRELY there.  What if the universe as a whole ends?  What if there's a big crunch, heat death, a big rip, or any of the number of other ends of everything that some physicists predict?  Your only hope at that point is to escape the universe altogether.  There are some theories suggesting that this is not completely impossible... that there are quantum tunnels to other universes and so on.  But here we have to leave off:  we have so little information about such things that there is no way to judge its possibility.    So barring some unusual disaster and given some philosophical reservations, it's possible that we can take you to the end of the universe.  But whether you go beyond is anyone's guess.|`|FmbwIbtzaa	Nothing of matter (physical energy) is lasting. Only the spirit is.

But we are only immune from aging, not immortal.  A speeding car would still kill us, a bullet would still rip through our bodies.  However if this were achieved, would you actually want it?  If one were immortal, one would watch everyone that they have ever cared about, known and loved die.  The haste at which we try to achieve goals would no longer corrupt out thoughts.  We could no longer celebrate a full life and peaceful death, just that we hadn't made any fatal mistakes yet.  Death is the great equalizer of humanity.  I for one do not want to see it defeated.|`|kTNz1VJuaa	Plato said that the only immortality that a man can expect is the endurance of what he creates.|`|AA10665398	i think that being immortal wouldn't be fair. sure, every body's going to die, but no one wants to be reminded about it so we fear it. but if we found a way for everyone to stay young, everyone would jump on it. then there wouldn't be enough room for more generations to come, because no one would want to leave anyone in their family or friend circle to die. so i think there would probably be some kind of test that someone would have to take that would prove that they could become immortal. or just let the richest people become it first, that's usually the way that most discoveries go.|`|AA12295528	it won't happen.

ozK2hKJZaa	It began in the 1600 between the 1700. People from the country moved from the city because they would get money and can get an industrial job. Like textiles manufacturing, mining, working with chemicals, working on transportation and etc. There were also cultural conditions in Britain so people from there. Trade expansion was enabled by the introductions of canals. These are what the industriual revolution did to people and their lifestyles. I will tell you some industries they had.    Textiles: Making old-fashioned clothes. (Knitting)    Mining: Finding coal, oil, diamonds, and rivers.    Chemicals: The most important part of the Industrial Revolution. It experiences sulphuric acid. The first making of chemicals.    Transportation: Working on railroads, car companies, and trolleys.|`|w13Zbnk7aa	1) Steam engines were inefficient and rare outside of coal mines.  2) Europeans didn't have any advantages based on their production. They even seemed to lag behind their Asian counterparts. China produced luxuries that were desired by westerners, but except for gold and silver, China wanted no part in trading with Europe. Intellectual tradition and politics seem to explain the early industrialization as well as the rise of commerce, distinguishing Britain economically. Commerce was not encouraged in Asia because the merchants were set in a lower class.   3) Westerners became addicted to buying low and selling high.   4) Britain was Europe's leading commercial and colonial power. It's colonies established commercial connections.   5) Britain's efficient economy gave Britain no trouble with exportation.  6)considerable access to expanding markets (population boom with wealthy people).     Hope this helps! It is hard to describe these in any less space.

Gc4UX1Mhaa	of course. even for watercolor that easily washes away, you should never leave the paint on the brush.      Now an alternative to washing is keeping it damp. so if your paint is oil based, keep it in a bag with a rag that has the turpentine or any solvent you use on it.     If it is acrylics, always dip it in water (without washing the paint away so you don't waste paint) and make sure it is quite damp and then keep it in a plastic bag.  for oils and acrylics, you could also leave the brushes in the freezer.

mqdkcHDFaa	Harry Potter is by far the superior series.  It's better written, has a better plot, and the characters are three-dimensional.  In Twilight, the plot is basically:  "Edward, I love you" and "Bella, I love you too but I'm dangerous for you"... Frankly, after four books of cheesy and cliche nonsense, that gets old.  Also, the characters in Twilight are all Mary-Sues/Gary-Stus.  HP's characters are flawed and believable.  My favorite book in HP is probably HP and the Order of the Phoenix.  Probably because I've always loved the idea of "secret organizations/rebellions".  Plus, Sirius died and it made me bawl.  For hours.  Obviously, Rowling is a much better writer as you said.  She understands that characters that are supposedly "perfect" get boring.  Plus, the plot is more than some lovey-dovey garbage.  And Rowling actually let some of her characters die, unlike Meyer, who apparently just couldn't bear to see her beloved vampires meet their demise.  As an added plus, Rowling did not have any pedophiles in her books (ie Edward is more than 100, hitting on a 17 year old; Jacob + Renesmee, etc.)|`|5I9aWZTyaa	Stop comparing the books!!! its so annoying and you can use the searchbar.

Harry Potter is better. Hand down.  Is written better. The characters seem more realistic and are easier to relate to. My fave book is the 5th because of the twins filling the school with fireworks. I just thought that scene was hilarious. J.K. is defiantly a much better writer than Meyer. She doesn't abuse the thesaurus and her grammar is better. I also think that HP offers a much more interesting read. A teenage girl telling us for hundreds or pages how hot this guy is gets boring fast. I like how in HP the characters actually developed as the story went on and were not just cardboard cut-outs|`|TPBDESp5aa	Well, I think it's hard for me to say which series is better, because one is a romance and the other is more of an action/mystery...I truly do love them both though!!!     Twilight  At first I hated New Moon, but after rereading all of them, I'd have to say I do like that one the best, I think because you see in a way, different sides of each character.    HP  Thats hard for me to choose, I'd have to say Order of the Phoenix. I don't really know why this one is my favorite, I think perhaps it is because you start to learn more about how stuff from the past is connected to what they were going  through now...    I think that J.K rowling is definitely better. (I've only read stephenies twilight series, so that's what i'm judging it against) She's put together this complex world that in the begining is kind of jumbled with bits and pieces here and there, but then as the story goes on, everything starts to fit together like a puzzle.  I think there's a bit more depth to her story.  I don't think it really has to do with experience, I think it is more the mindset of the author....  well those are just my thoughts...|`|BgZhTPKPaa	I completely agree with you! Jo Rowling's books are AMAZING! Twilight just cannot compare!     I've read ALL of BOTH series, and Twilight is too, well.....unlikely.

Blah blah blah, high school, blah blah love, blah bluh blah blauh bluh vampires.... that's all I see when I read one of the books.    My favorite books are Deathly Hallows and Prisoner of Azkaban because Deathly Hallows the most action and storyline, and PoA has Sirius in it. :)|`|6jzql1ssaa	harry potter, all the way.......    twilight...i liked it tooo, but it was a little incomplete in my opinion.........it was like      bella was pretty much thinking edward is rlly good looking          whereas edward was drawn to bellas blood...    that book could've been better, it felt like i was missing this whole chunk of the book, where they fall in love, it was like one minute they meet a couple pages later they are in love,    I think j.k. rowling's use of language, and overall writin ability was better than stephenie meyer's, twilight was dragged out a bit, i kno writing the ending to a series is probably the toughest, but i rlly didnt like breaking dawns overall plot line.....the final harry potter book wasnt the best either, but i enjoyed it and it ended on a good note......    i liked the 3rd harry potter book alot....idk y, i think it might be b/c it was alot lighthearted than the others, and harry finally realized he had a godfather,(i liked sirius)    i liked both books alot, but twilight would have to be alottt better for it to beat harry potter (my opinion)|`|9e735ab0447bc7e81bbed7e99c386ba5aa	Harry Potter is my favorite.  Twilight is good, but I think it centers around romance too much. Harry Potter has romance, but not too much.  My favorite book is either the 2nd or 3rd one... they were more innocent and had pretty good plot twists... Although the last one was pretty good.  I'm not going to judge the authors, but I like J.K. Rowling's books better.  Still like Twilight though!|`|jpiTh514aa	Yea Dave if your a guy you definitely just got your mancard revoked|`|J1bjIJ13aa	Really you don't have to pick which one is better , you can always accept that both are awesome writers lol ! The opinion is different for everyone .. i'm more into the twilight series though , i have never read a book in my life that has kept my attention through out the whole series ! why ? Because .. i don't know i guess .. the love between edward and bella is soemthing every girl dreams about and the story line is awesome ! My favourite book in the twilight series would definnetly be twilight .. the one i didn't exactly like the most was breaking dawm .. but yeah (:|`|MM4AaiG5aa	ok i love harry potter and all but i personaly think the twilight series is better because thats just whati think  my favorite book in the twilight series would probobly be the third one or the first one and my fav book in harry potter would be the goblet of fire  ok the third question is hard to answer  but my personal opion is that stephanie meyer is a better writer JK is good and all and he is ALOT more experienced but stephenie didn't plan for Twilight to happen it just sorta happened and she wasn't planning on publishing it at all thats why i think she's so amazing because she turned a simple dream into something everyone is talking about and is in love with.|`|R5zUR0Y7aa	Harry Potter is also quite drawn out....but Rowling is a better writer. Twilight series rocks if you like romance mixed with intrigue and fantasy.....and definately it has a much better ending in the fourth and final book...Breaking Down. its well worth the wait and definately the best book out of all of them. but you kind of have to read the others for it to make sense.   I feel the Harry Potter stories, in comparison, kinda annoyed me the more it went on....and on...and on...and on. if your into Vampire stories, Stephanie Meyer is definately worth reading!!
oHO0XOQVaa	What is the painting even like?
e4259abb4e5d0ea5a734423f5be756f9aa	Is it sad that I know so much about this show?      *Original show dates:  1969-1974, now besides me being born a month after the pilot, other historical events happened during it's run.  ---Moon landing was in July, technically 2 months before Brady Bunch premiered.  ---Vietnam war started    As far as other important events, I'll let you look it up.    ***Also remember, this show went into syndication right after it ended.  This was how I watched it as a kid.  In fact up to at least 2007, a Brady show has been broadcast somewhere in the world every day.  Although not the 1st show that dealt w/a blended family it was quite popular, especially w/kids..  I would say that was cultually important as far as the show goes.    It didn't tackle too many important social problems but there were a couple.  Greg trying smoking and Marcia trying to proove girls can do anything boys can.    It could be perceived as having a somewhat negative effect.  My Mom is famous for stating real families aren't like that.  I think a lot of kids wished they were part of the "perfect Brady family".  But for the most part the show did deal w/popular teenage issues:  dating, sibling rivalry, not doing chores/homework, tattling, not wearing ones eyeglsses etc.    There were many famous guest stars on the show as well.  Joe Namath (who was huge at that time) was on it.  The kids also sung songs thay showcased somewhat the type of music popular at that time.    All in all, it didn't set out to change the world but was a light comedy that has stood the test of time.

What is in your spray paint ?|`|X4Jm2nnhaa	Yes- you can put oil based poly over spray paint. If the spray is wet when you apply the poly the spray might run. Have good ventilation and wear an approved respirator mask.
ylHOsEiBaa	just dance by lady gaga! or juliet by lmnt or so much betta by janet jackson.|`|TlLA1DVoaa	"Sadie Hawkins Dance" by Relient K would be perfect. Very upbeat and positive. Makes you smile.     Or "Umbrella" (I like Marie Digby's version better than Rihanna's)    "Wherever We Go" by the Newsboys would be great too!!!|`|6UgFvIqoaa	any chris brown songs. also single ladies is the hit too.|`|4k18hNiTaa	Showtek is a fun techno-y group that has a lot of great songs!

0k0mSNXraa	wow, they charge you for fittings?!  the place I go to they don't charge you at all. it's just as long as you buy the pointe shoes.  i've never heard of a studio charging for fittings.  call them first (:|`|HYVKARkyaa	$10-$20 usually it depends where you go.|`|DNre29JWaa	It depends on the place-where i go, they don't charge me a dime, it's just the pointe shoes that are pricey.|`|jEzdtFEUaa	i think when i got mine done it was $25 dollars  and they did a wonderful job. they were always by us and always had more shoes to try on|`|7xbcoWKqaa	Everywhere I've had it done it was free as long as you bought pointe shoes.
