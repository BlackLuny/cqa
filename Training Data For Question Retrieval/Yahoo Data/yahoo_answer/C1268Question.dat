Ok, I've been doing my analysis homework with a friend, and we've had no problems with it until we hit the following problem.  We've been trying to prove this, and are getting nowhere (even though it really shouldn't be that hard).  So, any advice?  We're concerned that there may be a typo in what our Prof gave us to work on, since we cannot seem to get the proof.  Ha.  So, what do you all think:      Let φ : ? → ? be continuous for each x ≥ 0.  Prove:   ∫ ∫ φ(s)dsdt = ∫ (x-s)φ(s)ds      Note on the left hand side, the integrand with respect to t goes from 0 to x, and the integrand with respect to s goes from 0 to b.  On the right hand side, the integrand is from 0 to x.

20090304162812AAdn3S8	Science & Mathematics;Physics	Spinning a coin then shining a light on it to determine what side it will land on.?	Today, i took a ￡1 coin and made it spin on its side. I then shined a red light at the coin, and when I looked directly at the coin I could clearly make out the picture of the "tails" side of the coin. The coin landed with tails up.      I repeated this about 20 times, each time I shined light on a spinning coin, either "heads" or "tails" appeared clearly when I looked at the coin, and each time it landed on the side which appeared when I shined light at it.      The same image appeared from every angle, and tapping the coin while spinning as to just slow it down had now effect.      The question is: Why does this work?

Do you read the side effects of your medication? I worked in Pharmacy for a long time as a Technician. Of course, I know of a lot of medications, but not their side effects, but I do make it a habit of reading all about it before I take it. Even though the doctors know what they are doing, I still like to read what I'm about to take and all its side effects.       I'm Pregnant. About 16 weeks now. I've been having problems with Allergies (nasal passages being swelled up, feeling like I have to blow my nose a lot), since last May. I got Pregnant in November. Of course now I'm restricted on what I can take. Basically just Tylenol. I told my OB/GYN about my allergies and that nothing seemed to work before. We live in a dry climate too, so that doesn't help.   She put me on FLONASE nasal spray. Anyone take that before? I could not believe the extreme side effects of this medication. I'm scared to death of taking this. My OB/GYN also put me on Benadryl. I'm not taking that either. I'm just too afraid of something happening to my unborn baby. One of the side effects of Flonase is that it can STUNT the growth in Children, however, it will "probably" (and that's how they put it), won't affect their final adult height.  So, since this drug can get into the blood streem...there is no way I'm taking it. I'll just deal with the misery until the baby is born.      So, how many of you read the side effects/precautions of your medication before using it?

My dad and I were watching the news and the lady said that the government was trying to use the destructive power of tornados for good.

He says he hopes they figure out a way to use tornados to get rid of all the liberbras and devilcrats once and for all.  He said our entire state is a tornado magnet and the tornados here would be happy to work with the government because they are tired of eating beer cans, wine bottles, and abandoned cars on cement blocks.      He says sometimes tornados eat us rednecks but they always spit us out cause we are ornery like that and give them indigestion.  So I got scared and then my dad said that the government is making smarter tornados where they will only eat people with devilcrat in their genes.  He says my genes are repuplicking so I am safe.

My solution:   HX    H+ +X-   The 3% that got ionzed contributed evenly to [H+] and [X-] ions at equilibrium:   [X-]= 0.00100(0.03)= 3 x 10^-5   [H+]=0.00100(0.03)= 3 x 10^-5      What remains of the [HX] is 97% of the original concentration, so at equilibrium:   [HX] = 0.00100(0.97) = 9.7 x 10^-4      So the Ionization Constant for the acid Ka = [(3 x 10^-5)(3 x 10^-5)]/[9.7 x 10^-4] = 9.30 x 10^-7      Did I get it right?

20090306183138AAQfYUv	Science & Mathematics;Physics	How to do this  physics problem?	A 10 kg crate is sliding at a constant speed of 7 m/s along a frictionless horizontal table, when it encounters a friction patch (mus=0.8, muk=0.3).       1. Find the work done by  friction acting on the crate, after it has slid 5 m.      2. Find the speed of the crate after sliding this distance.      3. Some time later, the crate comes to rest. How much total work is done on the crate, from start to finish?* (from when it enters the friction patch to when it stops)      What I have attempted:   1. work done by gravity: (mg muk)(distance) = 10*9.8*0.3*5= 147      2. Vf=sqrt(2ad+Vo)   Calculated acceleration by: (muk*mg)/m=0.3*9.8*10/10= 2.94   So, then Vf= sqrt (2*2.94*9.8)+7^2^=10.33   3. clueless!       So I got all of them wrong. I thought I was starting to get physics. Argh.
20090306183521AAoTvMH	Science & Mathematics;Alternative;Paranormal Phenomena	Paranormal fun... What do you think is the reason why spirits take off fast when noticed?	I have noticed the reactions of spirits now that I think about it. They don't like to be seen, they take off fast, why do you think that is?      There were times when they didn't take off, and those were the times they communicate more. Usually them are the times I were in a stage of like an OBE while sleeping, or did have a Out of Body Experience.      So my question basically is why do they take off fast when you see them, either when you awake to see them or while your awake already?   What I mean when I say take off is, they walk off through a wall, float, spark, flash of light, mist, cloud, all moving away from you.      1) They don't want to scare us so they take off      2) They get scared because we can see them, they take off      3) They're testing their new sneakers out      4) Manifestation only last for seconds      5) They forgot to pick up milk and bread      6) It's not the right time to communicate      7) playing head games      8) Their testing to see if your skeptic       9) lets hear your answer?      10) 2 and 7      From my perspective and experience I would say two of these answers are correct, what two?

A block is at rest on an inclined plane whose elevation can be varied. The coefficient of static friction is mus= 0.410, and the coefficient of kinetic friction is muk= 0.190. The angle of elevation theta is increased slowly from the horizontal. At what value of theta does the block begin to slide (in degrees)?

For my science fair project this year, I was adding water to plastic storage containers with soil in them. I wanted the water to be spread out all over the surface, not just in one spot. So I drilled about twenty holes in the bottom of the same sized storage container, and I would pour the water in and let it all drain out.    But I have to present my project tomorrow, and I am at a lack of a good term to name this thing.    Any ideas? I was thinking 'water displacement device', but I am not sure if that is actually a real thing, or if it means something different.   Or what about 'water distributor'?   Any ideas/advice would be much appreciated....and you never know, you might earn 10 extra points! ;]
