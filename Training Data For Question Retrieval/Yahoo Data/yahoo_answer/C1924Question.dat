20090202224641AABpqXh	Consumer Electronics;Cameras	Camera Specifications for Aquarium?	I have heard a lot, on here, and elsewhere, that it is highly recommended to use an SLR camera versus the compact digital cameras. I wanted to test drive a cheaper SLR camera, (Nikon D40) but I didn't really want to spend all that money, so I'm trying out my Sony Cybershot. I have found that it is extremely difficult to get decent pictures of my Cobra Guppy, because the darn thing is sensitive to shaking, that if I barely nudge it, the thing comes out as if I were spinning the camera around. Now, I think alll this work is just not worth it.       I want to know what specifications and/or settings I should adjust on my camera, or should I look for in an SLR camera, to focus on the fish and not make everything blurry?          Please don't say "Turn your flash off, or else you'll get glare." I already know that.          Thank You.

I have a transfer cable, and just want to know if I can transfer the data from the old 120 to the new 120, so that the colors will match(They do NOT match).      I know Xbox.com says that you can't move data from a 120Gb HD, but I've heard people say you can still do it.  In my opinion I think it's a load of crap, but I wanted to ask if anyone has tried it and if it worked or not.

I'm aware that Tokina doesn't come with AF-S.    review says that Tokina's 11-16mm is better than Nikon's 12-24mm and much cheaper.   my question is:   1. if you can afford the Nikon's 12-24mm would you go for it or would you rather get a Tokina 11-16mm which is better according to reviews?   2. is it possible to manual focus with the Tokina 11-16mm? (I have intention to upgrade to something like a D300)??   3. whats the future of Nikon camera bodies? (will Nikon one day produce all its body to be like D40 where in you will need an AF-S lens to auto focus?)

I know, it's an old phone but I wanted to buy her the same phone to replace it because A) it matches her green camera and B) she hates technology and therefore would hate learning about a new phone.      Anyway, my question is is it possible to change the new phone's properties (MEID or ESN) so that it can replace her lost one?  She still has her box for the original phone I believe.      The phone costs $30 currently on craigslist.  And last time I broke my phone and went to verizon they charged me 20 bucks.  So I'd rather do it myself otherwise it only makes sense to buy a new one.       Please help a poor boy make his girlfriend very happy.        Thanks in advance.

20070713133046AA6d5iZ	Consumer Electronics;Music & Music Players	Sepperating Tracks for audio recording?	Me and a few friends are looking to set up a small home studio for recording our bands music.  I have done some research and have found there are many ways to set this up.  Stand alone consoles with a hard drive seem to be the cheepest way to start recording but I have learned that computer based programes are the best bang for your buck.  My question is how do you get a mixer to recored the mic's on seperat tracks?  Everytime I have pluged it all in I only get one audio track with all the mic's on it.  Any advice would be helpfull.

Call me crazy if you think otherwise, but i've heard lots of good things about it. Bad things about it, i'm only sticking to Verizon because of my friends. It's all Chocolate, other long names that i don't feel like mentioning.. BUT trust me, i think EVERYONE i know has it. Even my relatives. Anywho, thousands of things on the tip of my tounge..   Like,    What color? Black or Maroon?       How are the texting plans? Etc. (Can i remove the mobile web? I already have the iPod Touch for that stuff so, yeah.)       How much is it?       My parents have the 2yr contract but it's ending in June. Can they just, out of the blue, add a line before it's up?       What do Y O U think about it?       Please suggest other phones. By Verzion, include the price too!       I'm a bigbigbig texter, just that i've eased it a bit since my parents were suspicious (i was using their phones for texting most of my friends).. I think i use the phone a lot, but max i've ever got to was possibly 2 hours. Like talking.. Texting approx.: 12 or more, but nowadays (around late Jan.) it's like 6-10 only.       So yeah. :) Thanks.

They said I needed the account holder to purchase the phone. I don't understnad why they need the account holder. I thought about getting the phone i want from walmart, it is cheapest getting it online. All I want to do it buy the phone, and put my SIKM card into from the phone I'm using now. But to activiate the phone, don't I need to go through at&t for them to activate it? and they will need the account holder for that? So I am guessing there's no way around it . Please help.

20060725075335AA8JZsc	Consumer Electronics;Cell Phones & Plans	I'm not eligible for an upgrade through Verizon. How can i get a new phone at a discounted price?(not eBay)	I absolutely hate my current cell phone.  I only have had it for 7 months and it just stopped working. Verizon sent me a new one under the manufacturs warranty. I wanted to actually upgrade to a better phone but they said no unless i pay full price. Ok i understand not giving me a new phone at the discount price if you sign a 2 year contract.  Although why can't they give us customers who pay there bills on time etc.. some kind of discount. I mean they come out with better phones and if you are like me i love to have the latest. So now i have to wait another year to upgrade because i just can't spend $250-$400 on a phone. Yeah it might just be a phone to some of you but for me I love to mess with stuff like this. So if anyone know of any place to get a new verizon phone (not ebay though please) then please let me know. Thank you!
