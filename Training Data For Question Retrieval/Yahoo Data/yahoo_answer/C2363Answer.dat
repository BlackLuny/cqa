AA12109093	The Easter Rising was a rebellion staged in Ireland against British rule on Easter Monday, April 24, 1916. Despite its military failure, it can be judged as being a significant stepping-stone in the eventual creation of the Irish Republic. The rising was the most significant since the rebellion of 1798. It was an attempt by militant republicans to violently force independence from the United Kingdom. A major difference between the rising and many other Irish revolts was that it was led largely by a group of poets rather than military minded people.|`|7dd6f54b13c7727f08cb849cf57c0bb1aa	jesus rose from the grave|`|97c206aa5150923cd54b41eccd31b1d1aa	i dont know sorry

Cuando se dieron cuenta de que aquello no era la India, comenzaron a pelearse con Portugal por ver a quien le tocaba cada trozo de terreno, hasta que el papa Alejandro VI dividió la parte de cada uno a unos 500 km de la costa.<br>  Se dieron cuenta de que las tierras eran ricas en minerales y piedras preciosas, pero que estaban habitadas.<br>  Comenzaron a conquistar el territorio recién descubierto, evidentemente, los nativos se resistieron a la invasión. La conquista de Mexico fue llevada a cabo por Hernán Cortés con un grupo muy reducido de hombres, los atzecas pelearon duro y las batallas fueron muy sangrientas. De ahi se extendieron rápidamente hacia el sur, sin mayores contratiempos hasta llegar a Perú, donde los nativos nuevamente presentaron batalla y Francisco Pizarro y Diego de Almagro tuvieron enfrentamientos dramáticos. Pedro de Mendoza fundó en 1536 los primeros asentamientos de Buenos Aires.<br>  En cuanto a la colonización, al principio Fernando el Católicosdispuso igualdad ante la ley y nada de esclavitud, pero les fue imposible conseguirlo, ya que los colonos habían establecido una especie de "feudalismo", llamado encomienda. Posteriormente Carlos V intentó más de lo mismo pero su virrey Mendoza se estrelló y le tocó aplazar las leyes indefinidamente. A continuación se estudia que la gente ganó mucho dinero porque las tierras eran muy ricas, y que los indígenas eran esclavizados en las minas, como en Potosí, y en las tierras de labranza. El mayor defensor de los indígenas fue el dominico Bartolomé de las Casas, obispo de Chiapas. Aparte de por las guerras, los indios fueron diezmados por enfermedades desconocidas para ellos, sobre todo en el Caribe (nos ponen de ejemplo la gripe), y las duras condiciones de trabajo.<br>  La iglesia tuvo un papel notable, había una contraposición entre las altas esferas, por su indulgencia hacia los privilegios y las injusticias, y el clero local, que intentaba proteger a los indígenas de la prepotencia de los espa?oles.|`|r8hj3o2uaa	Seguro que les cuentan que fueron heroes, que conquistaron un país muy rico, que fue una lucha muy dura, bla bla bla.|`|502a860354638067fdfc4399da0cc7caaa	Pasaron los tiempos franquistas donde no sólo estaba prohibida  "la visión de los vencidos", también lo estaban los propios cronistas de Indias.<br>  Ahora, en Espa?a el que desconoce la historia de la conquista de México es porque quiere.<br>  Ahora bien, me da la sensación de que los mexicanos  tampoco conocen demasiado bien su propia historia.<br>  El escándalo provocado por la película "Apocalypto" de Mel Gibson donde se habla de sacrifios humanos entre los mayas, me hace suponer que en Guatemala y México idealizan las culturas indígenas en oposición al colonialismo espa?ol.|`|4ea588a71c71ad260d2c60d1598e9c24aa	Posiblemente, ya que yo soy mexicano y nunca he estado en Espa?a, lo que le dicen es que esas barbariaddes las hicieron los antepasados de los mexicanos de ahora.<br>  <br>  Y asi fue, cuando nuestros antepasados llegaron de Espa?a a a conquistar a México hicieron muchas atrocidades con nuestros otros antepasados, pero de eso creo que los espa?oles actuales no tienen nada que ver.

439f9961aaf08a80871ccafbb4cdcffcaa	Remember that the slope m is defined as<br>  <br>  delta-y / delta-x   -- that is, the change in the y value divided by the change in the x value.   Written another way, for a pair of points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2), the slope is<br>  <br>  m = (y2 - y1)<br>        ------------<br>         (x2 - x1)<br>  <br>  Now the only way that m can be 'undefined' is if (x2 - x1) is zero.  This is because anything divided by zero is undefined (this is a mathematical definition).  The only way that (x2-x1) can be zero is if both x values remain the same for both pairs of points.  How can y2-y1 change, not x2-x1?  --well, what if the line goes straight up and down? -- the y value changes up and down the line, but the x value never changes.  In this specific case, I think the equation for the line is simply <br>  <br>  X = 1<br>  <br>  If you graph that, you'll see a line that goes straight up and down at x=1.

Your work experience is also a positive.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, most top-notch law schools would like at least a B+ (3.3 GPA) to even consider a candidate and usually admit people with GPAs of at least 3.6 (a bit short of an A-).

For questions on numbers, you might want to look at lawschoolnumbers.com    This website allows you to search by law schools and keeps a tally of the students who have gotten into, been rejected from or waitlisted in that school and their respective GPAs and LSAT scores.  This will give you a realistic overview of what you're up against.<br>  Also, use the website princetonreview.com   to search the average LSAT and GPA for each law school you're interested in.  Now's the time to put in all that work, because it's 3 years of strenuous work and it's best if you're at least comfortable with your choice in the atmosphere.<br>  <br>  Also, try to resist limiting yourself to real estate, especially in your personal statements.  You don't want to appear narrow minded and disinterested in other aspects of law, but definitely touch upon your personal experience in real estate and your "following your dream."  Each application will ask for an explanation if you have been out of school for longer than a semester, so you'll get your chance to explain yourself there.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

Yes you can do community service elsewhere but members of the greek community are known to do a lot more than the average students.

From my own experience, I see being in a sorority as something that enhanced my college experience.  Yes, we paid dues (not that much) but the dues covered expenses that the organization has to pay.  Through the sorority I became more involved in the community, which I still continue to do. Also, being in a sorority gives people great connections in the work world..

Sure, some do things like community service, but you don't need to be in a sorority to do work in your community and you certainly don't need to be in one to make lasting friendships.

I am not sure if other sororities will be very accepting of you if you rush again.  You should ask someone who organizes greek life on your campus.

emle76Zqaa	Marijuana doesn't instantly addict you as they show you in the health films and propaganda films such as "Reefer Madness". You can smoke it and you won't immediately quit your job and become a raging addict. Weed deals in long term consequences, especially if it's accepted by your peers. You continue smoking it, thinking there's nothing wrong with it, but eventually your motivation, energy, and creativity suffer. Not to mention how much it sucks to get arrested for possesion. Going to NA is a terrible punishment and it takes up way too much of your time. Essentially, pot slowly changes you into a different type of person, and makes you more receptive to trying harder stuff, and once you start trying coke, shrooms, ecstasy, or acid, it goes downhill from there. School shows movies in an attempt  to stop this whole cycle, but they fail. Because the people that make these movies don't know a thing about drugs and have probably never done them.

5e222dbe865d039b56f47e5e3992505aaa	The Locard exchange principle, also known as Locard's theory, was postulated by 20th century forensic scientist Edmond Locard.  Essentially Locard's principle is applied to crime scenes in which the perpetrator(s) of a crime comes into contact with the scene, so he will both bring something into the scene and leave with something from the scene. Every contact leaves a trace.<br>  <br>  “ Wherever he steps, whatever he touches, whatever he leaves, even unconsciously, will serve as a silent witness against him. Not only his fingerprints or his footprints, but his hair, the fibers from his clothes, the glass he breaks, the tool mark he leaves, the paint he scratches, the blood or semen he deposits or collects. All of these and more, bear mute witness against him. This is evidence that does not forget. It is not confused by the excitement of the moment. It is not absent because human witnesses are. It is factual evidence. Physical evidence cannot be wrong, it cannot perjure itself, it cannot be wholly absent. Only human failure to find it, study and understand it, can diminish its value. <br>  - Professor Edmond Locard|`|Lxpt9S2uaa	idk

r5Mxre6Saa	Black sheep of the family<br>  Meaning<br>  <br>  A worthless or disgraced member of a family.<br>  <br>  Origin<br>  <br>  The first record of 'black sheep' in a derogatory sense that I can find in print is from Charles Macklin's The man of the world, a comedy, 1786:<br>  <br>  "O, ye villain! you - you - you are a black sheep; and I'll mark you."<br>  <br>  It isn't entirely clear why black sheep were selected to symbolize worthlessness. Possibly it is just the linking of black things with bad things, which is a long standing allusion in English texts - black mood, black looks etc. It may also be because shepherds disliked black sheep as their fleeces weren't suitable for dying and so were worth less than those of white sheep. <br>  <br>  There is also a contradictory long-standing English country tradition that black sheep are omens of good fortune. The Folk-Lore Record, 1878, included this piece:<br>  <br>  "We speak figuratively of the one black sheep that is the cause of sorrow in a family; but in its reality it is regarded by the Sussex shepherd as an omen of good luck to his flock."<br>  <br>  Other 19th and 20th century references from Somerset, Kent, and Derbyshire agree with this view that black sheep indicate good luck; others say the opposite. Charles Igglesden, writing on Shropshire beliefs, in or about 1932, gave the opinion that black sheep were considered unlucky and added that the only way to avoid the bad luck is to cut their throats before they can 'baa'.<br>  <br>  Old joke alert -<br>  <br>  'Why do black sheep eat less than white ones?'.<br>  'There aren't as many of them.'

If you plan well, go to summer school the next two summers, and don't get distracted by options like psychology class, you should be able to graduate the summer after your junior year.

s9tvr0DTaa	a metrical unit of poetry.<br>  <br>  DEF:<br>  the use of such metaphors as a literary characteristic, esp. in poetry
WTUFboWiaa	The very first thing to do is to make sure all your units are equivalent.  Because your rate is in km/h, change the 10 minutes to hours. So:<br>  <br>  (10 min/1)*(1 hr/60 min)=1/6 hour<br>  <br>  Now set up equations.  Using the equation Distance = Rate*Time, we can use x to represent distance like the problem instructs.  So we have x=rt.  The first equation will be x=75t based on what was given in the problem.  The second equation will be x=80(t-1/6).  This is a little bit trickier.  We changed it to 80 because we increased the rate by 5, as stated in the problem.  We changed t to t-1/6 because we're subtracting 10 minutes or 1/6 hour as stated in the problem. We have to use 1/6 to keep all the units equivalent.  Now we can just set the two equations equal to each other:<br>  <br>  75t=80(t-1/6)<br>  75t=80t-40/3<br>  -5t=-40/3<br>  So time is 8/3 hours.<br>  <br>  Now we can plug that back into one of our other equations to find distance.  It doesn't matter which equation you use.  I'm going to use x=75t because it's a little bit easier.  So:<br>  <br>  x=75(8/3)<br>  x=200 km.<br>  <br>  There you go.
B5x8ZQrVaa	WELL ID LOVE TO GIVE IT A TRY..<br>  Well firstly, racism is a public act where race, colour, national or ethnic origin of a person or a group, is likely to be offended, insulted, humiliated or intimidated.<br>  <br>  <br>  Racism is rapidly growing, some people believe it is ok to treat others contempt, especially all the jokes going around and name calling for individuals of different races.<br>  <br>  <br>  They misinterpret the fact that this actually hurts people's feelings. Many people are judgmental when it comes to racism and couldn't bother to be less respectful for one's age, gender, colour or nationality and this needs to change.<br>  <br>  <br>  Unfortunately, some people think that people with darker skin are less than qualified to be in this country and sadly are unwelcome. This is wrong.<br>  <br>  <br>  Some people in this supposingly loving country often misunderstand the rights of people with different races and often fail to consider they are humans too. All races have the right to be here and must be treated according to whom they are not to where they come from.<br>  <br>  <br>  Another reason why people are racists is that they prejudge a person by means of looks or skin tones, not giving them the fair chance to express their thoughts or try to show the kind nature they might have. This is so not okay.<br>  <br>  <br>  I am worried about those who are being abused by racism.<br>  I am worried about those who think it is right to discriminate one of a different race.<br>  I am worried about how kids today are using violence as an answer to racism.<br>  <br>  <br>  My opinion it that people who discriminate others are the ones who should not be in this country because Australia should be a country where all races are welcomed.<br>  So, although this helps people in Australia, it doesn't help the world... And although this way might hurt, I believe the best solution would be just to ignore their "hurt" and after a while they'll know that being a racist, has no positive effect on people, therefore why would they want to waste their time, bringing less racism in the world.<br>  <br>  I hope my speech changes a little something inside every one of you, and maybe one day we could even baby steppingly, make an improvement, changing the world into a better safer place.|`|TRrTunqvaa	the topic isnt ON racism.. the the topic IS racism...<br>  <br>  racism does not have to be public. it can be subtle and private, such as when two people are faced with the same job and and the less qualified person is pick because of his superior race<br>  <br>  "many people are judgemental when it comes to racism and couldnt care less about their age, gender, colour or nationality and this needs to change"... thats talking about predjudice... youre talking about racism.<br>  <br>  "many people are judgemental when it comes to racism and couldnt care less about their age, gender, colour or nationality and this needs to change" asians and white people are subjugated to racism, yet you only talk about "dark skin".. and say "its needs to change because.."<br>  <br>  "All races have the right to be here just like any other person does." that sentence is unequal.. "all races have the right to share equally"... your sentence compares an entire race to one person, which sounds unrealistic.<br>  <br>  youre worried? you shouldnt be worried. you should make your audience worried.

1wXYKfJQaa	If your in college, you have to get this kind of table signed each lesson, which you then give in on a friday for ur ema to come through.... if you havnt missd a day of a week u can get a table sheet and go to the teacher to get that signed and give that in (  for back dated payments )<br>  <br>  I used to get ￡30 , but im 16, so it might differ from age
rNZWUxiBaa	well don't overload yourself!! that sounds like a lot, and since you're a freshman, i'm assuming that you're not in any AP classes at the time (they are very challenging btw) so really, taking 3 sophmore year is a little much, and you want to get good grades, right? haha, of course! just make sure that your schedule leaves time for a LIFE. trust me, i kinda overladed myself once, and it screwed with my head..lol. maybe take some at the Pre-AP level rather than the AP level, just to get you adjusted to AP testing, essays, and all that stuff.|`|VEzNOVSPaa	Maybe take AP History. It isn't that difficult and isn't much different than honors. And yeah colleges love to see AP classes but don't overwork yourself.|`|5072b3b89f8612ecc6eda9bdd15499f1aa	take AP Psychology and AP Biology.<br>  Ap bio. is not hard hard, but you need to study a lot.<br>  Ap psychology is actually pretty easy for AP.<br>  good luck! colleges love AP'S!|`|GcTYftsbaa	God this makes my high school look like total garbage.<br>  We have only AP Language and AP History.<br>  This isn't really an answer, it's more of just me complaining. Sorry|`|9202729d2797b335c2ba85914d0aba07aa	I don't think colleges really care when you take AP classes during your high school career, as long as you spread it out (as in, don't take all general classes freshman through junior year and then randomly take all APs senior year). It looks good to start early, but don't overload yourself.<br>  <br>  I heard AP Human Geography is one of the easier AP classes out there, and if you really like science, you could double up on science and be fine (I doubled up on Math this year, and my friend is taking Honors Chem and AP Bio this year). It really depends on what you want to do with your life--if you're leaning towards the medical field, AP Bio would be best, unless you really want to take AP Psych. I will warn you that AP classes are MUCH harder than Honors courses.<br>  <br>  You don't really need to "make up" for not taking APs freshman year--a lot of schools don't allow students to take AP classes until sophomore year with AP World History (which is a HARD class). At least, that was the case at my school.<br>  <br>  In conclusion, if you have the motivation and the time management for two AP classes, then go for it. If I were you, I'd take AP Bio and AP Human Geography, but that's just personal preference (I want to go into the medical field). If not, just take one.
ngkOotbYaa	honestly, colleges could careless if you take ap classes or not.<br>  but they could be very useful especially if you pass the ap course. in that case, you'll be credits ahead of MANY incoming college freshmen, which is a good thing.|`|pSbqOO7zaa	take 1 AP class to start out. TRUST ME. honors classes are nothing compared to AP,my school only offered AP world history for sophmores,and then in 11 and 12th u can take all the rest. AP world is considerd one of the easier APs, and the class average is a C.<br>  <br>  start out with one to see if u can handle it!!<br>  i bet u can if u have been taking honors classes but u need to get used to the workload befor u take multiple aps.|`|jf94YQ1yaa	I know you want to take advantage of all of the highest education courses you can get your hands on, good for you, but also bad. <br>  <br>  I was told that the maximum A.P. courses you should sign up for is two, that being the two top courses you are willing to extend studying during college. <br>  <br>  Trust me, the stress is going to catch up.

22oMednCaa	All is not lost.<br>  From what I can tell, it's not a scam to steal and use your information. Instead, the scam is that they charge 80 bucks to fill out paperwork you could fill out yourself for free, they do the job so poorly that the forms are often rejected, and they charge a monthly fee that's nearly impossible to cancel. Point is, it sounds like they need your payment info to do all this, which you didn't give them. So here's what I'd do:<br>  <br>  First of all, try to contact them directly and request that they purge your information from their files. You don't want them selling it to some other company. Here's their customer service number: 1-866-514-5948. Be brisk and polite at first, but if they give you a hard time, be pushy. If necessary, DEMAND that they remove your info, or you're calling your state's Attorney General (that'll get their attention). <br>  <br>  Second, even though you didn't give your credit card numbers, thieves can open up brand new accounts with your social security number. There's no way to directly monitor your SS number, but you and your mom should watch your credit reports carefully for at least a year or two, to make sure nobody's doing anything financially crazy using your numbers. A few times per year should cover it. By law, you can get one free report per agency per year. There are three reporting agencies, so you can get one report every four months.  Here's the website: <a href="https://www.annualcreditreport.com/." rel="nofollow">https://www.annualcreditreport.com/.</a> This is truly free– it's the government, not that singing guy on TV (which, by the way, is a scam). <br>  <br>  Or you can just buy all three reports at once. Not free, but not crazy expensive, either– it's about $30 for a 3-in-1 report. I use Equifax: <a href="http://www.equifax.com/3in1-credit-report-score/" rel="nofollow">http://www.equifax.com/3in1-credit-repor...</a> <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|DWP2Sj7taa	that happened to me too....but i didn't submit it...i merely erased it and put bogus info|`|ZmSd4CGgaa	You just need to keep a close eye on yours and your mom's credit info and what not. They might sell your SSN. That happened to my dad but no from the FAFSA. It's really scary. Don't get paranoid though. Like the person above said, they most likely just wanted your money. Oh and by the way I hope you don't enter college so naively.|`|jcWIM6fKaa	First, good for  you that you recognized the scam.  Without the credit card, at least you do not have a financial obligation to them.  I am a high school counselor, and the advice you got from Sonya is excellent.  I could not add anything else.

I would spend some time gathering evidence.  Example: instead of "almost every day is a free day," keep track in a note book when you do so you can say "this month we have had 15 out of 20 free days."  This is a much more effective argument.<br>  <br>  I agree to have your parents address the principal.  It might be worth it to drop down to regular Algebra 2.  Unless you plan on being a math major in college you don't absolutely need to be in honors.  I know schools make a big deal about it, but if it is a waste of time you'd be better elsewhere.  Bottom line, it is really hard to change a teacher's methods or get them fired, so just get out of the class.|`|ks8CViw4aa	It is possible that the teacher that the school hired has a degree in a different subject.  However, if other students feel the same way as you do, sit down together and speak with the teacher.  Make sure that she does not feel threatened by all of you, so speak calmly and matter of fact-ly. you may even make one of you the "spokesperson".  Tell (as a group) her how you feel, make sure that you site specific examples of how you feel your class differs from other math classes in the same school.  If you can get a syllabus from another math class or get examples of homework, quizzes, etc about how you feel that you would like to be taught.  If you do not feel comfortable going to the teacher, go to another teacher that you feel comfortable with or the principal.  Make sure that you have specific examples and not just your opinions, as there is a real fine line between both. Good luck and I think you are a smart student for taking charge of your education! Good for you!

To ancient philosophers, the question about the first chicken or egg also evoked the questions of how life and the universe in general began.<br>  <br>  What most people do not know is that there is a logical answer for this question. Actually, there are three possible answers to this question. At first this may seem out of the ordinary, since the question only offers two possible answers <br>  <br>  First, if you believe in evolution, then the chicken egg came first. To over simplify this answer, the theory of evolution believes that at one point in time, a bird species very similar to the modern chicken, let’s call this a proto-chicken, mated with another proto-chicken. Whatever the reason or reasons, a genetic change occurred in the egg created by the proto-chicken, thus a chicken egg was created instead of a proto-chicken egg. <br>  <br>  Alternatively, since evolution is typically very gradual, most likely at no point in time was a chicken egg created from a proto-chicken. Instead, each generation of proto-chicken produced another animal that was even more genetically similar to the modern chicken; and after a long period of time, eventually this produced the modern chicken species. Since the science of taxonomy does not easily distinguish between intermediate species of animals, at no point in time did a proto-chicken produce a chicken egg. Furthermore, it is believed that all species, even current species, are only intermediate animals, thus labeling them as species is technically vague. As a result, the proto-chicken species did eventually produce the chicken species; however there is not a clear delineation between proto-chicken and chicken. Therefore, the second answer to this famous adage is that there is no definitive classification of either a chicken or chicken egg, so it is impossible to determine which came first. <br>  <br>  Finally, if you believe in religion, then God directly created the chicken. There is no logic that can be examined with this belief. As a result, the third answer is that God created the chicken first. <br>  <br>  Therefore, the paradox of "Which came first, the chicken or the egg?" can be unraveled into three completely different answers. It is up to you to decide which answer is correct.|`|Sj74XGh4aa	the chicken|`|AFCzYOUyaa	I'll go for the EGG, since ADAM came first.|`|AA12361379	In the beginning, God created the earth and all that live upon it.

12d54aae44a56fa45d6d9f5011d6c253aa	haha.  No, there's no standard service that comes w/ college.  Some colleges may offer facilites for on-campus students but, no one is doing it for them.  <br>  <br>  You have several ways to look at this:<br>  <br>  1) You can continue life as normal.  Get a small job weekend job or an on-campus job or if you're lucky ask parents for a small allowance while at college.  Then you can pay someone to do your laundry.  You will need to buy 2 baskets and then take them to the closest laudromat and they will do your laundry for a fee and you should tip them a little.  So, problem solved.  Laundromats typically offer the drop off and pick up service for a fee.<br>  <br>  2- This could be a great thing to learn.  You could ask your mom, dad, or sister how to do your laundry.  You will have to do it eventually...and it makes a great impression on women when they find someone hardworking and self suffiencent.<br>  <br>  3- You could meet girls this way by asking tips on how to do your laundry...not exactly ideal but, an insentive to learn.  I'm sure someone at college would be willing to help you learn as well.<br>  <br>  4- Person you can call and do laundry for you....hmm....well perhaps this is a great oppurnity for YOU!  You could be the person people call!  If you learn over the summer how to do laundry you can advertise you'll do laundry for your roomates of people on your floor.  Then they buy the bags and put their names on them for their laundry.  You do your laundry AND make money off them.  Take something to read or study when doing laundry.<br>  <br>  Laundry is easy and doesn't have to be all bad.  Let us know what you decide.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|paerqxfMaa	Figure out how to do laundry - you're a smart guy - you'll be going to college!!|`|0JL3Mg78aa	Um, learn the process.

Multiply 96 by 1.3125 (which is 1-5/16") which equals 126" (or 10 foot 6 inches) - do the same for the 2 10/16 dimension (which is actually 2 5/8) ~ 96 x 2.625= 252 inches which is 21 feet.

AA10652489	Drafting is when a driver rides directly behind another driver (although, I guess you could say rider, as well) in order to use less energy because of the decrease of air pressure.  <br>  <br>  The driver in the back is riding behind the other driver's "slipstream."  When the driver breaks out of the slipstream, it produces a small boost, which is how many racecar drivers and cyclists can pass others so quickly.  <br>  <br>  I hope that makes sense.|`|AA11920612	Drafting or slipstreaming is a technique where two vehicles or objects align in a close group reducing the overall effect of drag due to exploiting the lead object's slipstream. Especially when high speeds are involved, drafting can significantly reduce the echelon's average energy expenditure required to maintain a certain speed and can also slightly reduce the energy expenditure of the lead vehicle or object.<br>  <br>  Drafting is used to reduce wind resistance and is seen most commonly in bicycle racing, car racing, and speedskating, though drafting is occasionally used even in cross-country skiing and running. Some forms of triathlon allow drafting. Drafting occurs in swimming as well, both in open-water races (occurring in natural bodies of water) and in traditional races in competition pools. In a competition pool, a swimmer may hug the lane line that separates him/her from a swimmer of whom s/he is abaft, thereby taking advantage of the liquid slipstream in the other swimmer's wake.<br>  <br>  In cycling, the main (largest) group of tightly packed cyclists in a race is called a peloton, where cyclists riding in a long shaped formation. Each (but the first ones) drafting behind the others before them.<br>  <br>  When cyclists ride fast, they form a paceline. Each cyclist (but the first) is drafting behind another one.<br>   <br>  Belgian tourniquet (Belgischer Kreisel)<br>  <br>  In order to ride very fast, a team of some skilled cyclists may form the belgian tourniquet. Successively, each cyclist lead the group.<br>  <br>  Drafting can be cooperative, in which several competitors take turns in the lead position (which requires the most effort and energy consumption). Or, it can be competitive or tactical, where one competitor will try to stay closely behind another leaving him or her more energy for a break-away push to the finish line.[1]|`|cLTCxJhQaa	Drafting in this sense means to follow very closely to the car in front of you letting their car move the air for you-less wind resistance for your car.

Nk876YgJaa	I would choose the High School where your friends are at.<br>  <br>  I had a similar delima in high school and I decided to  take the risk of moving in with my dad and going to a new school thinking it would be great. The new high school had over 2000 kids (grades 10-12), and my previous high school only had about 400 kids (grades 9-12). It was 4 stories high, and had sooo many more clubs and things to be involved in.  They had 4 levels of classes .. standard, academic, honor, and ap. So I thought that this would be the oppurtunity of a lifetime.<br>  It was at first, but eventually you start remembering how much you gave up, and it is hard. You begin to feel like everyone there has already made their friends, and even though they want to be your friend.... Theyd chose their older friend any day. The new school is so unfamiliar it comes off as scary.<br>  By time it was all said and done by my 11th grade year.. Id have killed for any bit of familiarity. It all felt so overwhelming.<br>  <br>  I had sooo many friends, but I realized how fake they were. My senior year I spent a bit depressed about it, and though I was asked to prom and did a lot of fun stuff, it could never replace what I lost.. and I decided against going to graduation. Even though I graduated with honors.<br>  <br>  Think about it.. In college you will get that new chance to be the new kid.. Do you really want to change everything when its about to change all over again later? Do you want stability ?<br>  <br>  I understand the grass is always greener on the other side though, and you are going to do what you want regardless of what we say. Im just saying you will regret it later.|`|34VXCyvVaa	What are you more interested in -- the stimulation of more challenging classes and smarter classmates at the new school or staying in your comfort zone with all your friends at the second high school?  My guess is that you'll be happier with your friends at school #2 because you're not ready yet for the challenge of going out on your own.  Some people relish the chance to go to a new school because it represents a fresh start, a chance to reinvent themselves, greater opportunity for personal growth and the chance to try activities that they might not otherwise try.  Other people prefer familiar surroundings and the comfort of friends even if that means passing up some unique opportunities.  You have to decide which type of person you are.  <br>  <br>  One more thought -- if high school #1 is a brand new school, then everyone will be starting fresh there and people will be much more friendly (kind of like moving into a newly constructed neighborhood).|`|uHg9rVbWaa	I would go to the college where you can graduate with a high school diploma and an associates.

A triangle of face tissue including the nose and mouth was taken from a brain-dead female donor and grafted onto the patient.[4][5] "Scientists elsewhere have performed scalp and ear transplants. However, the claim is the first for a mouth and nose transplant. Experts say the mouth and nose are the most difficult parts of the face to transplant."[6]<br>  <br>  Doctors and the media debated whether the donor and/or the recipient had attempted suicide. The family of the donor told the funeral director who handled the donor's death that the donor had an accidental death. Local French newspapers stated that Dinoire's daughter said that the mother attempted to commit suicide. Dubernard said that the recipient did not try to kill herself. Olivier Jardé, an orthopedic surgeon from Ahrens and a member of the National Assembly, said that both the donor and the recipient attempted suicide. The Sunday Times, a British newspaper, stated that Dinoire said that she tried to commit suicide via a telephone interview<br>  Recovery<br>  Whether the challenging surgery will be proven successful in the long run is yet to be seen<br>  OR<br>  ANOTHER HEADLINE COULD BE<br>  Doctors will transplant a face — but whose? <br>  By Robert Davis, USA TODAY<br>  CLEVELAND — While doctors in France and China are making headlines with partial face transplants, the American team that has been screening disfigured candidates for the past 19 months still hopes to make history.<br>  Doctors, psychiatrists and ethicists at the Cleveland Clinic are poised to perform the world's first full-face transplant, removing an entire face, both ears and a full head of hair from a brain-dead donor and attaching them in one piece to a recipient who will be left with few visible signs other than a few scars on the neck.<br>  <br>  They've been gearing up since November 2004, when the clinic became the first U.S. medical facility to be approved for such a procedure by its Institutional Review Board — an internal panel that oversees biomedical research involving human subjects.<br>  <br>  And while the clinic still appears to be the U.S. front-runner, Maria Siemionow, the team leader and surgeon who will perform the transplant, acknowledges that it could take place tomorrow or not in her lifetime.<br>  <br>  Why is it taking so long? Doctors and ethicists say the perfect candidate for the risky procedure has eluded them. And there's the challenge of finding a donor as the team deals with a national transplant system that has no specific provisions for this surgery.<br>  <br>  The story of local resident Gwendolyn Arrington, who has emerged as a de facto spokeswoman for people with severe facial trauma, highlights the painstaking nature of the selection process. When Arrington heard the clinic was preparing to perform a face transplant, she called to request a new face. "It was like my prayers were answered," she says. "I always believed it could happen."<br>  <br>  But she soon learned that she would not be a candidate. The medical team is looking for someone more disfigured than Arrington, who has had dozens of operations to repair burns she suffered in a 1989 natural-gas explosion in her home.<br>  <br>  Arrington, a 39-year-old mother of three, now looks good enough to shop for her family and go to work. "I still don't look like myself, but the progress I have made is definitely remarkable," she says. It has been years since Arrington heard a stranger call her "a monster."<br>  <br>  There are no statistics on how many people are hidden from view because their faces are badly disfigured by fire, trauma or disease. And it is very difficult to find people, such as Arrington, who are willing to speak to a reporter and be photographed. She is one of the few who has been quoted in news articles on this subject.<br>  <br>  The Cleveland Clinic experts say they are looking for someone who has run out of conventional surgical options, someone whose life has been ruined by the disfigurement. The candidates also are evaluated to see if they are psychologically strong, competent enough to fully understand the risks and committed enough to comply with a lifetime of complex medical regimens.<br>  <br>  The outcome is so uncertain, they say, that the recipient has to be willing to risk death. "Would they trade their life or part of their life if worst comes to worst?" Siemionow says. "Maybe this is their last-chance procedure

AA10248239	These are only opinions, but here goes:<br>  <br>  The state should be required to educate the children of illegal immigrants, as these children did not, themselves, deliberately break the law, and they are part of the future of the country.<br>  <br>  With the modern threat of terrorism, it seems logical to permit the government to use cameras in public places.  If there is a concern regarding personal privacy, access to viewing the video tapes could be dependent on the acquisition of a court order.|`|T17pbHVJaa	First I'll start with the video camera's in Great Britain. I am from there, but now live in the USA, but for 7 years I drove on British roads.<br>  <br>  My view, they can be a pain at times, but I do see the need for them.<br>  The only problem I have, is that there are speed camera's EVERYWHERE. If you go like 5 miles over, then the camera will flash and you get a ticket in the mail. I think this is a little crazy and seems like it's really for revenue generation. <br>  <br>  However, having surveillance cameras in cities and on main roads is good. It can help traffic police know where there is a traffic accident. It can record how the accident happened, which can mean that police do not need to spend as much time or money figuring out what happened and therefore can clear the roadway quicker because everything had been recorded.<br>  <br>  Also here is a quick true story that happened to a friend of mine.<br>  His car was stolen from his home late at night. He work up not long after it was stolen and told the police the make, color and license number. The police spotted it on the freeway miles from his house and send police after it. After a chase they caught the guys and found out they were a car stealing gang. They found my friends stolen phone as well that was in the car and traced the numbers the crooks used on it and in the end arrested 15 people and brought down the whole car stealing gang.  This would never have happened, if the police did not have cameras on the freeway.<br>  <br>  So generally I think it is a good idea.<br>  <br>  ---<br>  <br>  As to Should the state be required to educate the children of illegal immigrants?, I think not.<br>  The whole point is here that they are illegal. So why should they get anything from tax payers? They should be deported immediately I think.<br>  I know lots will not agree, but I am an immigrant to the US - a legal one. Why should they get away with things when I went through tons of paperwork, laws etc to have that right?|`|DCFpYvxEaa	I think you should write the paper on: <br>  <br>  Should the state be required to educate the children of illegal immigrants?<br>  <br>  Only because I believe they should. Every child, even illegal immigrant's children, deserve to get a proper education. There is so many things in this world that revolve around having a proper education, and no child should never have that education. Remember the 'NO CHILD GETS LEFT BEHIND' slogan? Well, that applies to immigration children also, i beleive.

2wdVqIc7aa	Unless your teacher asked you to, you should never start with "my speech today is about" or "today I'm going to tell you". A better way to start would be to act like you're making yourself a to do list: sport practice, homework, date, party, do laundry. Then in the middle look up as if you just noticed the class and say, "Homework sure isn't my first priority. Should it be?" Then proceed with what it is and this is why it SHOULD be a priority. You have so many more job opportunities available with a good education, and part of that is studying. Then your paragraph about what else is part of a good education (social life). Then for your conclusion you can revise your to do list you made and say I'm guess that party will have to wait a couple hours until I finish my homework.

2UvVIRjNaa	a) Does the recognition of depreciation in the accounts provide a special cash fund for the replacement of fixed assets? Explain.<br>  <br>  No, the recognition of depreciation in the accounts does not provide a special cash fund for the replacement of fixed assets. The recognition of depreciation in the accounts causes a portion of the asset value to be converted to an expense. It is necessary to retain the original balance in the account for a plant asset; therefore, the adjusting entry first recognizes the expense by debiting an account. entitled “Depreciation Expense.” The corresponding credit is made not directly to the asset account but rather to an account that is classified as a contra-asset. A contra-asset is a negative account the will always represent a credit entry offsetting a specific asset. The account is entitled “Accumulated Depreciation.”<br>  <br>  (b) Describe the nature of depreciation as the term is used in accounting<br>  <br>  Depreciation is the recognition of a loss in value of a plant asset due to wear and tear over time. The matching principle states that all costs that were incurred to generate the revenue appearing on a given period’s income statement should appear as an expense on the same income statement. <br>  <br>  A method used to implement the matching principle is systematic and rational allocation. Many costs cannot be directly linked to specific revenue transactions. They can, however, be tied to a span of years and allocated as an expense to each of those years. Depreciation as used in accrual-based accounting is an example of this method:<br>  <br>  Sales equipment (i.e.: Furnitures/fixtures) is essential to generate revenue. However, linking the cost of each display case, piece of furniture, and the like to specific sales transactions is difficult. Instead, the equipment’s cost is systematically allocated as “depreciation expense” to the years during which the equipment helps generate revenue.

g4APbW4Naa	It's an urban legend.  Balancing an egg on its end is no harder or easier on the Spring equinox (March 20 this year).  The legend says that this is only possible on the first day of spring, but often trickery is involved.<br>  <br>  There is nothing about the equal periods of dark and light hitting the Earth that makes things more "balanceable".  Yet every year a bunch of TV reporters hear this for the first time, it seems, and go out to try it on the sidewalk.  If they were to try this on other days, it might work then too...it's all about the skill of the egg balancer, not the day of the year.<br>  <br>  Watch the people who do this trick closely - sometimes they make a pile of salt (or sugar), balance the egg on the pile, and blow the salt away.  Another trick is to shake the egg, scrambling it inside the shell, which makes it much easier to balance.|`|8VrlRUfhaa	And day and any time...since you did not specify standing the egg on its end.|`|K6U9kVQfaa	u mean easter the egg hunting?? that will start in april i think but if u want u and i make love then we can make eggs and play wit it then can name the egg w/e u want!!

With a graph<br>  If you do not have an equation for a function but want a table of values start again by making two columns, one for x and one for y.<br>  Then, using your graph pick an x-value on the horizontal (or x-axis). Use a pencil or ruler to move vertically from that x-value until you hit the line on the graph.<br>  At that intersection point, move your ruler or pencil horizontally back to the y-axis (vertical axis). The value which you reach is the y-value co-ordinate for the x-value you picked. <br>  Fill this in your table.

Drag queens are a type of transvestite as are drag kings, they dress up as a way of playfully mocking gender stereo types.<br>  <br>  But most trannies are just average joes who for whatever reason enjoy wearing clothing of the opposite sex.  And most feel guilty about it and feel they have to hide it so they become depressed and ashamed.<br>  <br>  But it really has nothing to do with sexual orientation at all originally, since sexual reassignment and transsexuals is a fairly recent thing.  In fact most trannies are "straight".  I happen to be bisexual though.  And a large number of trannies (cross dressers) hate the term drag queen.<br>  <br>  It has also come to be used on transexuals (one who has undergone sexual reassignment surgery).<br>  <br>  And of course transgender one who was born with one set of machinery and identifies as either the opposite sex or both sexes( sometimes referred to as androgynous).<br>  <br>  So there is a lot of confusion even among the community that uses the term as to how it should actually be used.  I suggest if you can't "tell" by looking at the person that you do not assume they are homosexual, some people will get offended.

The famous facade with the balcony was unknown to Queen Victoria. The main front was only built in the early 20th century by Sir Aston Webb and stuck on the old palace - which accounts for the rather unclassical proportions.<br>  <br>  It was opened to the public to raise funds for the repair of the Queen's home at Windsor Castle (which was uninsured when it caught fire).|`|1oj4aamaaa	Because the royals need an opulent palace that the overtaxed peasants will pay for.|`|rDb9ZLyfaa	Buckingham Palace is the official London residence of the British monarch.[1] Located in the City of Westminster, the palace is a setting for state occasions and royal entertaining, and a major tourist attraction. It has been a rallying point for the British people at times of national rejoicing and crisis.<br>  <br>  Originally known as Buckingham House, the building which forms the core of today's palace was a large townhouse built for the Duke of Buckingham in 1703 and acquired by George III in 1761[2] as a private residence, known as "The Queen's House". It was enlarged over the next 75 years, principally by architects John Nash and Edward Blore, forming three wings around a central courtyard. Buckingham Palace finally became the official royal palace of the British monarch on the accession of Queen Victoria in 1837. The last major structural additions were made in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, including the present-day public face of Buckingham Palace.<br>  <br>  The original early 19th-century interior designs, many of which still survive, included widespread use of brightly coloured scagliola and blue and pink lapis, on the advice of Sir Charles Long. King Edward VII oversaw a partial redecoration in a Belle epoque cream and gold colour scheme. Many smaller reception rooms are furnished in the Chinese regency style with furniture and fittings brought from the Royal Pavilion at Brighton and from Carlton House following the death of King George IV. The Buckingham Palace Garden is the largest private garden in London, originally landscaped by Capability Brown, but redesigned by William Townsend Aiton of Kew Gardens and John Nash. The artificial lake was completed in 1828 and is supplied with water from the Serpentine, a river which runs through Hyde Park.<br>  <br>  The state rooms form the nucleus of the working Palace and are used regularly by Queen Elizabeth II and members of the royal family for official and state entertaining. Buckingham Palace is one of the world's most familiar buildings and more than 50,000 people visit the palace each year as guests to banquets, lunches, dinners, receptions and the royal garden parties.|`|AA11103493	1.

bI35qqGTaa	Thoughts of change and freedom were sparked in the minds of people in the late 1780's, influenced by terror, hate and hunger.  The French Revolution changed the history of Europe irrevocably and caused much destruction throughout France.  Maximilien Robespierre was behind the turmoil, given to abusing the authority given to him, especially in the times of the Reign of Terror.  He may have been a brilliant lawyer with good intentions in the beginning, but his power over others turned him into a vile dictator which eventually led to his own downfall.  <br>  <br>  Another idea for you... i would strongly suggest at least, getting rid of the sentence about the heart, grouping sentences together better and sticking to the topic.

Ftkr9jqYaa	When the term "recess" is used in the phrase "deep recess," it denotes a shallow or small indentation, concavity, hollow, depression, or cleft.  Thus, a DEEP recess is a relatively large indentation, concavity, hollow, depression, or cleft.<br>  <br>  For an analogy, whereas a rivulet might be called a recess, a canyon might be characterized as a deep recess.  A scratch on the skin could be described as a recess, while a gash might be called a deep recess.
iE2sDxDAaa	Business Management is generally not taught in secondary ed, and if it is, it's taught at a such very low level such that I would not consider it Business Management. Although on a rare occasion there could be a specialty school that does teach the basics. The closest thing I've seen even relevant to business management was economics taught in a social studies (history) course (and accounting course or two).<br>  <br>  If you really want to teach Business Management, your best bet would be a College/University. Community Colleges only require a Masters degree... to get your foot in the door

51e15a40a62db9f2e165d0a6a8359b6baa	Here is a possibility that would absolutely shake up how laws are written AND interpreted by the courts.<br>  <br>  Have a federal amendment to the Constitution that would require the Federal Supreme Court to only consider the Constitution when reviewing laws or ordinances or regulations brought by lower courts or proposed by Congress. In other words, make a law that says the Supreme Court can only use the Constitution for judging the 'legality' or 'constitutionality' of practices/ordinances/regulations/laws presented to it RATHER than using precedence (this court case referring to this previous court case which was derived from this earlier court case, etc. ad nauseam) <br>  <br>  Here's an example: if a state wants to pass a law defining marriage as inclusive of anyone who wants to marry anyone else, then IF they bring that case to the Federal Supreme Court, the Court is obligated to review what the Constitution states about it, NOT what BlahBlah versus YaketySchmackety says about it or what the opinion of Justice Joe Blow wrote about it 75 years ago. Do you get my drift?<br>  <br>  It would be a law that TRULY creates a balance for the Judicial branch of government, rather than allowing judges to 'legislate from the Bench' based on their political leanings.<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope it helps!|`|lkksoCjVaa	Hm... what are you College or just a Really hard school...

VTGm3UNBaa	Getting 8-9 hours of sleep will do you 10x more good than that energy shot will. Sleep improves your concentration and it the way the body sorts through previously learned information (for example if you studied today, sleeping tonight will solidify that information). The shot won't really affect you much if you have had enough sleep. It will just make you jittery which might distract you but not much. It might make you THINK your more awake which might help marginally. <br>  <br>  I wouldent just because itll make you jittery and give you hot flashes from the niacin. Sleep is 10x better for you. Just remember to eat before the ACT, bring water with you, and use the bathroom beforehand. It's a long test. A bean and cheese breakfast taco is the perfect before test meal!|`|AA11404425	They really don't do much unless you are sensitive to caffiene ...<br>  generally a bunch of herbs, B vitamins and caffiene, more placebo effect than anything else.

It says it doesn't cause jitters, but they effect everyone differently.  You don't want to hinder your performance.  For some people they help  you concentrate... but for others, your thoughts might be racing so fast that you can't think at all.  Just get a good night's rest and eat a healthy breakfast and you shouldn't need the drink.  If you have your mind set on drinking it, I would take the first half of the test, then on break, see how you feel and drink the drink then if you really feel like you need it!  From personal experience though... I wouldn't drink it at all!  Save it for after the test and enjoy the energy rush and the good feeling that you have the test done and over with!|`|Xewmwcg0aa	nothing wrong with a little boost. make sure you have planty of sleep before the test and a good breakfast. some energy drinks and pills makes people shaky, if this is true for you then i would not take it. you want to be focused , not jittery, making small mistakes|`|iWghWH6Taa	YEAP, BECAUE ,MOST OF THAT STUFF MAKES YOU JITTERY OR SLEEPY.

If you have good reading skill, then you obviously will pass the reading part, but as a bonus, you will also pass the science and social studies part.  Good reading skills will also help on the multiple choice section of the writing part.  You will still have to write an essay to pass the writing and deal with the math section, but reading will help you pass 3 and a half of the 5 sections.  Start reading everything you can; books, magazines, the newspaper, news sites online.  Trust me, it will help.

b1xbe5Hlaa	Today I have decided to talk about the Haida population, because two summers ago I had the opportunity to go to their land and meet some of them. <br>  Haidas are a native population of North America, who live in the archipelago of the Queen Charlotte Islands, known in the Haida language as Haida Gwaii (meaning land of Haida).<br>  Those islands are on the British Columbian coast, in the western Canada.<br>  To go there it’s necessary to drive along a long, beautiful, wild road to Prince Rupert, and then to catch a ferry.<br>  The navigation takes about six hours, but in my opinion it’s very exciting.<br>  In fact I was in the bow of the ferry, where the cold wind messed up my hair, and I could see some whales jumping, and the islands coming closer, little by little, waves by waves.<br>  The Queen Charlotte Islands were covered with fog, which is normal for most of the year. I could see only some part of the green land, which appeared and disappeared.<br>  The atmosphere was very strange, unreal and I felt as I was catapulted in the movie “Pirates of Caribbean”.<br>  A lot of people don't live on the island, because it is difficult to have contacts with the mainland, especially when the sea is rough, so a large part of the islands are covered by the rainforest.<br>  In the northern part of the main island, there is the village of Masset, where the most part of natives live.<br>  When I went there, I was very lucky because I had the honor to be invited to a traditional Haida ceremony, which is called a potlatch. <br>  Today, Haidas usually wear European clothes, but in the ceremony, the most important people of the clans wore the traditional clothes, singing their songs and eating together. <br>  It was a strange situation for a European man, who is used to be the majority, in fact that time we were “the others”, the different people. We didn’t know the languages, customs, or the foods, and we didn’t know exactly how, or what we had to do.<br>  At the beginning of the ceremony, everybody began singing songs and the bosses went into the big room wearing traditional dresses. Everybody in the room (((set up))) and after a little procession the bosses set(((sat??))) down and the dinner began. (((I think you mean stood up??)))<br>  The song with which the procession came in was this one.<br>  In that time there were the Haidas of both clans. In fact the Haida belong in one of two clans, the raven or eagle. The choice of clan was done maternally at birth and the marriage among the Haida has to consist of a person from each clan. Their tradition is matrilinear, and women are very important and respected in their society.<br>  Every family has her totem pole with the symbol of her clan and their own story, In fact totem poles represented family lineages and privileges.<br>  In the south islands, there are two ancient Haida villages where the population lived centuries ago. One of those is the village of Skedans, where we went by seaplane. There are the relics of the ancient village and very old totem poles.<br>  Haidas believe that everything must return to the nature, so they aren’t restoring the totem poles. Because of that the old totem poles are going to disappear.<br>  Another symbol of the Indian culture is the Dream Catcher like this one.<br>  Indians believe that dreams, both good and bad, descended from the night sky. Bad dreams were captured in a web and held there until the rays of the morning sun evaporated them. Good dreams slipped through the web on to the dreamer. <br>  I like that thought so I put one of them over my bed.|`|COl96Vglaa	You have some punctuation errors.

GuUQmMceaa	Ah, yes, good old Britain.  Well, depending on what years your talking about varies the answer that I can give you.  But if your doing a day by day report of that era, you may want to start out Chronologically by saying a small story about the time in which era your writing about.  Try using the weird english of back then and create a small story to get your reader (most likely the teacher) some type of attention grabber.  Usually a small story connects with the reader and makes them more attuned to your essay.  From there you would start from the same era as your story suggested.  <br>  <br>  Towards the end of your introduction, you should tell the reader what your going to talk about in your essay, which is your thesis.  Because if you talk about the British empire, that's a huge book collection, you can't write one single essay over something that can fill a library.  So you have to narrow it down to what your going to tell your reader, write about in your essay.  <br>  <br>  After you decide what  your going to write about in your essay, you can start doing some research into and and piecing it together to make your essay, be sure that it has a logical structure to it and that it follows Chronological order.  <br>  <br>  When your all done you need to re brief your reader of what you just told them, thus ending your essay with your thesis, leaving your reader a more educated person :)<br>  <br>  Good luck on your essay, i hope this helped.|`|86907ad9cce026f929aa1445843edac4aa	once upon a time, long long ago|`|fMKPp6qkaa	you shouls have a beginning that isn't too common, or boring, but still factual. i guess that doesn't help much but that's what you have to do.|`|zbBFuu5iaa	Well we did essey in school n I started wit 'In this essay i'm going to write about...' and just put what your going to write about.

You would "major" in liberal arts or pre-nursing etc. when you enter.  You need to research the requirements and the process at the schools you wish to enter.  There is no bias (usually) if you are coming from a community college--often these transfers do better overall than someone who was at a large university the entire time.

You might say "...Swabia, near present-day Whatever."<br>  --He died of "Alzheimer’s disease"?  Perhaps he died of "...what is now thought to have been Alzheimer’s disease."  The way you put it, when he died, they decided to put "Alzheimer’s disease" as the cause of death.<br>  --I'm not sure of this one..."he was the bishop of Rome."  might be better stated as "He was Bishop of Rome...", since "Bishop of Rome" is, I think, a title.<br>  <br>  As I said, not bad.  And my complaints are petty.  But frankly, your report is so good I thought, why not polish off the rough spots?
9PgxZ3akaa	Well, for 3-4 mark questions where it asks you to look at a source, DO NOT USE YOUR OWN KNOWLEDGE. Make a simple observation from the source, and then make an inference/conclusion that relates to the question. Go into some detail, but keep it relatively short (4 sentences MAX.) If the source is a text, you almost always want to use a quote to support your inference and observation.<br>  <br>  For 12 mark questions or 15 mark questions that DO NOT INCLUDE SOURCES, and contain the word "WHY?", always use factors. Brainstorm a minimum of 3 factors (if it is a 15 mark one, you probably want to use up to 5) to answer the question. For each paragraph, explain WHY in relation to the question, give an example from your own knowledge and explain how that example proves your general point. Most importantly, at the end of each paragraph, make a LINK or two to at least two other factors. <br>  You must then make a judgement about the most important factor and say why.<br>  This will gain you full marks.<br>  The most common mistake people make is forgetting the LINKS and the judgement.<br>  <br>  For 12 to 15 mark questions THAT USE SOURCES, you must reference ALL of the sources. You really need to use these sources to explain your answer, so USE OBSERVATIONS AND QUOTES from each one. (These questions are more about the sources than your own knowledge). However, to incorporate your own knowlege into your answer, you need to prove the consistency of the sources as well, so ALSO USE EXAMPLES FROM YOUR OWN KNOWLEDGE ALONG WITH QUOTES AND OBSERVATIONS FROM SOURCES. This will prove you know your stuff, and you are good at analyzing historical sources.<br>  <br>  hope this helps a bit, I'll write more later..! :D

7HKTDcvYaa	Start by asking yourself whether your definition of what success is might be a description of how to achieve success, rather than the end product.<br>  <br>  This is part of what the exercise is to get you to do.<br>  <br>  For instance, being happy may be overrated, compared with being needed. Being a positive influence may be more important than just surrounding yourself with them, learning from the successes and failures of others may be important as a way to reach success, but like learning from your mistakes, it is not part of what success is.<br>  <br>  People who define success in terms that do not include being needed and useful to others may struggle forever with success because they are not seeing what makes one successful.
R5UIMBvcaa	To the best of my knowledge, she didn't.  In Greek mythology, very few widows remarried.  She undoubtedly had the right to refuse to take a second husband, but we know that often a legal right doesn't carry much weight in the face of overwhelming force.  (So the suitors are breaking the law--who's going to make them stop?  Not the Council, as we see in Book 2.)  She may also have realized that avoiding giving ANY answer was wiser and more effective, at least for a while, than an outright refusal.<br>  <br>  The only piece of ancient Greek literature I can think of in which marriage to the widowed queen is part of the package offered to the prospective new king is Oedipus Rex, and there are several differences, one of which is that it was written more than 300 years after the Odyssey.  In addition, Jocasta was a member of the Theban royal house herself, and the inheritance may have passed through her.  That's not the case with Penelope.  In addition, as far as anyone knew, Laius, Jocasta's first husband, had left no son to succeed him.  But if Ithaca is in the market for a new king, surely it should be Telemachus.<br>  <br>  Finally, not only is Telemachus theoretically a reason why Penelope should be free to remarry or not, as she pleases, but he's also a reason why she walks that fine line with the suitors, refraining from choosing or encouraging any of them but not flatly rejecting them all.  Once they get the idea that, if Odysseus is indeed gone for good, the next king sould be Telemachus, they may decide to kill him.  And in fact, once he has shown himself a force to be reckoned with by complaining about them to the Council, they plot to do just that.  Fortunately Athena has already sent him on a voyage and won't bring him home until his father is back.|`|3258fd9ca0baa8e13a1a5449e7bdca00aa	She was supposed to remarry, because under the law and customs of the time women weren't allowed to inherit property or titles.  With Odysseus presumed dead, the lucky suitor would get to be king (for all practical purposes) until Telemachus grew up and became of age.  The lucky guy would also be living like a king for the rest of his life, even though ownership of everything would pass to Telemachus.<br>  <br>  That's assuming, of course, that nothing happened to Telemachus.  As slimy as those suitors were, I wouldn't put it past any of them to have arranged for Telemachus to have a fatal "accident" shortly after the wedding.

After he had provided purification for sins, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty in heaven. <br>  <br>  4 So he became as much superior to the angels as the name he has inherited is superior to theirs. <br>   <br>  5 For to which of the angels did God ever say, <br>     "You are my Son; <br>        today I have become your Father[a]"[b]? Or again, <br>     "I will be his Father, <br>        and he will be my Son"[c]? <br>  <br>  6 And again, when God brings his firstborn into the world, he says, <br>     "Let all God's angels worship him."[d] <br>  <br>  7 In speaking of the angels he says, <br>     "He makes his angels winds, <br>        his servants flames of fire."[e] <br>  <br>  8 But about the Son he says, <br>     "Your throne, O God, will last for ever and ever, <br>        and righteousness will be the scepter of your kingdom. <br>   <br>  9 You have loved righteousness and hated wickedness; <br>        therefore God, your God, has set you above your companions <br>        by anointing you with the oil of joy."[f] <br>  <br>  10 He also says, <br>     "In the beginning, O Lord, you laid the foundations of the earth, <br>        and the heavens are the work of your hands. <br>   <br>  11 They will perish, but you remain; <br>        they will all wear out like a garment. <br>   <br>  12 You will roll them up like a robe; <br>        like a garment they will be changed. <br>     But you remain the same, <br>        and your years will never end."

JoyIIiZ6aa	The best way to start an essay like that is to tell a story of something that happened and made a profound impression on you.  Here is an example:<br>  I will never forget the first time I saw Ms. S for many reasons that had little to do with actual teaching but showed me grace under fire, and unbridled energy combined with incredible courage.  Ms S was always old to me.  She looked more like a benevolent grandma who should be sitting somewhere on the bench in the park than a dedicated language teacher.  She was tiny like a filligree but sparkling with energy as her perriwinkle blue eyes evaluated each of us individually and as a group. Like I said before, our first meeting was an unforgettable one. Our local library caught on fire.  I was there looking for something to borrow, she... Well, I have no idea why she was there.  She had the most humongous personal library one could ever imagine in her home.  The alarm went off, and everyone panicked, everyone but her.  She got up on the table and in her most commanding teacher's voice issued orders for evacuation, putting an end to panic and chaos.  When everyone was safely out, she went back in three times and carried out the entire collection of rare and antique books.  She would have gone one more time but by then the firefighters arrived and stopped her.  She tried to argue her way back in to save the rest of the display, but they would not be swayed even when she called their captain by his first name and reminded him that she corrected his essays.<br>  <br>  I hope this gives you an idea on how to begin your essay.  Good luck.|`|zknQnJgUaa	Have you ever talked to a person who seems to know everything and is willing to share, in language you can understand?<br>  <br>  If your teacher has warned you about using 2nd person pronouns in writing, do not use it.<br>  <br>  Perhaps better,<br>  Who has talked to a person who seems to know everything, and willingly shared it in understandable language.|`|uSW53DKAaa	"The best teacher is _____ because..."
HnI5VMbmaa	Ottawa U is a great university for what you are getting into.  Just to let you know there is a very high French presence that can be slightly annoying at time (not the people just the insane amount of emphasis on appealing to the French)  <br>  <br>  Anyways, I went there and enjoyed it but I've attended a smaller university and enjoyed it even more.  People who talk about "last chance" universities don't know what they're talking about.  When I switched schools I found NO difference academically between the two.  You should think about what you're looking for.  If you want the typical atmosphere go to Ottawa U.  If you're more inclined to a more intimate atmosphere go to a smaller university.  I've had many friends go to U of T or U of O and hate it.  Some people go to Carleton or Western and love that.  But again, from personal experience I found no difference between the universities.  <br>  <br>  By the way, I do know that the Co-op at Ottawa U is very good and the campus is in such a beautiful area right by Parliament and the Market.  For the co-op program you must maintain an 80 average.|`|AA12092556	well, not to sound smug or anything, but you're better off going to a university here in the U.S.  there are a few good schools in Canada, but it barely compares.  <br>  <br>  i'll tell you what though...  getting really good grades from almost any university is better than okay grades at a really good school.  just try hard and you'll be all set at University of Ottawa.|`|gbCB0ohJaa	The reputation of a university as a whole may be very different from the reputation of a specific program, and neither of them may be a particularly good indicator of the quality of education you will get there.  Compared to US universities and colleges, Canadian universities really do not vary widely in quality, due to different systems of funding and accreditation.<br>  <br>  If you want to know what "everyone thinks" about U of O as a whole, look at Macleans or the Globe.  If you want to make a good choice of program, just look at that program.  Co-op programs are typically harder to get into than non-co-op.  <br>  <br>  According to the U of Ottawa admissions site, you're required to have credit for the Calculus and Vectors course (which means a pass), but if you don't, you can take it at the university in the summer or in the first semester.   If you're failing calculus now and you don't have six credits without it, you should probably contact them and discuss your best strategy.  If they've offered you admission based on your record so far, the offer will spell out the conditions you need to meet as you finish high school. Read your letter.

AFWTpS7Daa	i understand you feel like crap right now and to get up and go take a test you already don't want to take in the first place is hard but try and take as much medicine you can tonight, go to sleep early, and get under some covers because its best to take FCAT on the day of instead of on makeup day, there's no other students in the room with you on makeup day and you don't have the same chill atmosphere but if you still feel bad then don't go call the school and tell them you tried but it wont work. your coughing and sneezing can distract you from the test because it stresses you out and it will also distract the other kids in your class. i am trying everything to stay well so i don't miss these next two days. i have never taken a retake but with the strict parents i have i don't think i ever will. lol<br>  so feel better and whenever you take it i hope you get all 5's!! lol|`|0Fur5dudaa	You should have a parent or guardian call the school notifying them that you are very sick.

d014f113fb3eecfed19b0fbba5d885d9aa	One of the top sights is the American Society for Quality (ASQ) - which is the largest professional organization in the quality field.  If you want to be in the quality (either control or assurance) field, then you need to be at least aware of these guys and if you are lucky, maybe your employer will pay for you to have a regular membership.  If not, you may consider paying for it yourself.<br>  <br>  There are many things that you can get from this group.  The primary thing to answer your question:<br>  <br>   - Professional Certifications: from technician to quality engineer to quality manager and many many more - including the top rated six sigma green belt and black belt on the market today.<br>  <br>  Yes, they have online courses and there are local groups of this society that offer refresher courses.  However, most of the stuff can also be achieved by self study with any number of references provided by the ASQ or any number of other groups that cater to helping people become professionally certified.<br>  <br>  Beyond ASQ certification, there are a number of consulting groups that offer any variety of courses/programs that will "certify" you in virtually any quality topic that you can think of: TQM, Shainin Master, Six Sigma (a lot in this category), ISO 9001, Baldrige, etc. etc. etc.<br>  <br>  So for you, it will come down to what you want to accomplish at your employer.  If you just want to say that you have a "certificate" that going to your local community college may be all you need (yes, they may have an online course as well) as many schools do have online programs today.  <br>  <br>  However, if you really want something that is worth dollars to you now and in the future (at any employer), then I would recommend looking at the various ASQ Certification Exams and trying to pass any and all of the ones you think will help you.  Given that you stated that you are already and engineer, I would suggest starting with the Six Sigma Green Belt exam.  From there go to Six Sigma Black Belt, then Certified Quality Engineer, then Certified Manager of Quality and Operational Excellence.  This is a very good track to use in any company or industry today.<br>  <br>  Now beyond all of the above, get a free subscription to both Quality Magazine and Quality Digest.  These are not affiliated with ASQ, however, they are free and have a lot of great information about quality today.  If you join ASQ, one of the benefits is a monthly magazine called Quality Progress and that is really good.|`|p2NnwRj4aa	sorry skiiffy,cant help you with that one.

You can't really do much anything about it, plus suing someone costs a lot of money, wouldn't advise you to do that just for diarrhea, just buy some pepto bismol...|`|AYct1ZFRaa	If i'm correct I think the vending company who supplies your school is supposed to buy the expired food/juices back..... SUE them|`|LGidAYDwaa	I don't know if you can sew (which means using a needle and thread to sew something) but you have no case against the school for a law suit.  If anyone, it would be the vending company that stocks the machines. Complain to the school, and you'll likely be refunded the cost of the beverage. It would help if you have the bottle so you can show proof that you bought some old juice. And the vending company might even have a management type person check up on the rep that didn't remove the old juice. <br>  <br>  If you end up getting so sick that you have to visit the ER (and they also have to run the proper tests to prove food poisoning), then you can try to sue for the medical bills - if the hospital's tests prove it was food poisoning and that it was the juice which caused it. But know this: it is extremely rare to get a dangerous form of food poisoning from juice. Just drink lots of clear fluids and avoid taking anti-diarrhea medication if you think it really is the juice causing the diarrhea. It should clear your system soon.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.emedicinehealth.com/food_poisoning/article_em.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.emedicinehealth.com/food_pois...</a> about food poisoning|`|jccJI9liaa	Sue is spelled "sue".  Sew is what you do with a needle and thread.  I would say no.|`|rbXCALUhaa	its spelled sue*<br>  <br>  and only if its a private school.. public schools usually feed students crap :P|`|qwvijKexaa	sew the damn school|`|BGjNqDloaa	Yes you can, I forget the name of the law but it is some health safety procedings or something like that. I am a manager at a retail store, and every day we must remove and dispose of all expired products in our produce, meat, and food/beverage departments. If not we CAN be sued for selling any kind of expired product and someone gets sick off of it, ill give you a tip, diarrhea isn't enough, they might disregard it as a health issue, tell them that you got extremely sick and missed school/work or something like that, in order to win most cases when sueing someone the reason must be because the product was a detriment in your normal lifestyle and made it difficult for you to do things as normal.|`|VovdTt2gaa	I don't know... you'll have to ask someone else. But you know, you should have looked for the expiration date before you started drinking. That's what I always do, ever since the school gave us milk 2 months overdue and people started puking all over the place. But I don't think you can sue unless it costs you money. If you're buying money for your diarrhea, then maybe you can. Who knows....|`|2vBmRcv6aa	Food poisoning takes at least 24 to 48 hours to set in.    That is not your diarea. If you truely think that this is dangerous I hope you notified someone in charge so no one else would drink it.<br>  If it is the sealed mass produced pasturized juice it is surely OK anyway. I buy expired juicy juice all the time at our local discounted item store.  I'm fine. Get good grades if you want to have money in your life. Don't try to take money from our school systems.

D8Sm2o3Xaa	Ok so here's the deal. Depending on how much you want to go there is what should influence your decision on going or not. I think you'd get used to the whole pooping thing eventually. When you have your period what you should do is just pack a whole lot of pads and tampons and such in your bag and have your family send you some when you run out. Also the school nurse I'm sure will have some. Going to a boarding school is a lot of fun. It's like being in one big family and having a sleep over with your friends every night. Usually the academics are harder but I think it's worth it. Your questions aren't stupid, no worries, I'm sure you'll figure it out.

And when it subsides you have to make a decision. You have to work out whether your roots have become so entwined together that it is inconceivable that you should ever part.

That is just being "in love" which any of us can convince ourselves we are. Love itself is what is left over when being in love has burned away, and this is both an art and a fortunate accident.

Nuuk1Nwtaa	I opted to do my gen. ed. requirements at CC for two years, and then will transfer to university for another two years to get my BA. Overall, it really comes down to 1) what you'll get for financial aid at university 2) who is paying for your education and 3) how important it is to you that you get the "freshman experience" of going to university. I can't tell you what to do, but going to CC saves so many thousands of dollars and you take the same classes you'd take at university. <br>  <br>  Keep in mind that you can always transfer after a year or two, should you change your mind, and already being in college works to your advantage when you apply for university. The best advice I can give you is go with your gut and don't let people bully you into a decision. What may have been right for your parents or classmates maybe isn't right for you, and you have to do your own thing. Good luck!|`|AA10461819	It depends on a lot of things. You have to ask yourself a lot of questions. <br>   If the problem is money, some universities cost less than others, will you be receiving financial aid? Will you be living out of state and in a dorm or commuting?<br>  Did you ever dream of the "college experience?" Or does it not matter to you? Are there any universities that you really want to go to? Do you feel ready to go to a university or do you feel like you need more time?<br>  Another question you should ask is, what do I want to major in? If your not sure yet, community college would be good to give you extra time to think about what you want to do until you transfer, as well as save some money.|`|6e902ba5b8bd99003ad43ac387de6637aa	Go to community college.

This way I still got the "University experience".<br>  This worked well for me. I have a friend who did the same thing and was the Valedictorian at the University.<br>  <br>  Another argument for a community college besides the price difference is the class size. I took Finite math at university and was in an auditorium with 4 hundred students. I had a teacher assistant that could barely speak English and couldn't get help. The tests were done multiple choice fill in the bubble, so there wasn't any partial credit for showing your work. My math classes at the community college were about 16 to 20 people. Teachers were very accessible and willing to help you. Composition classes at the University were just as large. <br>  <br>  A community college is a good place to get your gen ed done and save the classes in your major for the University--especially if you are undecided what your major is.<br>  <br>  Good luck with what ever you decide.
QRRD8THLaa	I know quite a lot of the home learning people from my work.  If you can you give me an idea of what it is you wish to study a I can probably help.  <br>  <br>  However, as a general guideline, don't sign up for a course where the provider is also the examiner, for example own brand diplomas. They won't mean anything in the world of work and it also means that there is no standard to which the provider is expected to reach so the materials are, in my experience, quite shoddy.<br>  <br>  Have a look in the various review centres on the internet and ignore glowing references written by anybody anonymous as they are frequently written by the provider.<br>  <br>  Have a look on the providers website and see if they provide links to sample material, If they don't then they are probably of too poor a quality to use for advertising, in which case you can be confident that they are also too poor to study from.<br>  <br>  For computing I would try computeach, for GCSEs and "A" levels I would try Oxford Open Learning, for higher level courses I would try either the OU or the London External Program.|`|AA11220909	I started a course with them a decade, I am STILL waiting for them to answer a question AND return my coursework.

Usually financial aid will cover only a percentage of the tuition, they'd rather give more smaller grants than fewer larger grants.<br>  <br>  Catholic schools tend to cost less than other private schools. It varies to how religious the schools are, some take very few non-Catholics, some take up to about 30% non-Catholics.<br>  <br>  You need to check when the admissions process begins in your area. In many areas it starts in September the year before you want to attend the school. For those schools, the decisions are made in March for next September. Some areas may just be starting the admissions process now, so check out their websites and see. The website will have info on how to apply. You'll need to fill out an application, a financial aid application, get teacher recommendations, visit the school and have an interview, and take an entrance exam. Most private schools have more applications than there are spaces, sometimes 4 or 5 applications per space.<br>  <br>  Are there any public (free) magnet or charter school near you? They can be more like a private school than public and they don't cost anything. I live in LA and there are performing arts, business, science,  medical, fashion, etc charter/magnet schools. Sometimes they are separate schools, sometimes they are like schools within schools.<br>  <br>  Private schools can be a really great experience, but the good ones tend to be quite a bit more difficult than public schools. LOTS of homework!! <br>  <br>  Here is a good listing of private schools so you can check out those that are close to you:<br>  <a href="http://www.privateschoolreview.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.privateschoolreview.com/</a><br>  Boarding schools: <br>  <a href="http://www.boardingschoolreview.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.boardingschoolreview.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.schools.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.schools.com/</a><br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|Gt0nqzqAaa	the problem with private school scholarships is that the schools that offer the largest scholarships are the hardest to get into. The ones that are easier to get into don't have as large an endowment, so they can't offer as large a scholarship
WuhIoS1laa	In short, you pass two exams containing information considered basic in the computer support field. <br>  <br>  The first exam is required. The second is your choice of three other exams. <br>  <br>  If you haven't ever worked in the field, but want to it is a good certification to have that shows you have some knowledge of the inside of the systems you would be supporting. <br>  <br>  Go into a good book store and in the computer section you should find several exam guides for the CompTIA A+ certification.<br>  <br>  If you have a junker computer it might help you become familliar with the insides of a system.  See if you can get a cheap old PC from a second hand store, or a surplus liquidation site.  Get yourself a few tools like a philips head screwdriver, a flashlight, needle nose pliers and a anti-static wrist band.  You will pick up other items as you need them. <br>  <br>  Hey! here's a pretty decent site that describes it: <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/A%2B_Certification" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/A%2B_Certif...</a><br>  <br>  EDIT: Ask a more specific question with more detail instead - you have done nothing to improve the results you are likely to get.

To find that, you  need to know the height and the length from the middle of the base to the corner of the base.  Once you found the side, use pythagorean theory to find the height of the triangle. Then apply the formula (b*h)/2 to find the area of one triangle.  Multiply this by four, then add it to the base.

Fnbz8q9Vaa	Do you understand what a context clue is?<br>  "Text book writers usually know when they must use a word that will be new to their student readers. So they often include other words or phrases to help with the understanding of the new word. These words or phrases are referred to as context clues. They are built into the sentences around the difficult word. If you become more aware of the words around the difficult words you encounter in your reading, you will save your self many trips to the dictionary. You will be able to make logical guesses about the meanings of many words."<br>  So basically you say the same thing twice - once with the word you need to use, then once the same thing but different word.<br>  <br>  <br>  So I'll do a couple for you just to get you going. <br>  <br>  "She found it difficult to TESTIFY against her husband; it was  hard to SPEAK AGAINST her husband IN COURT after twenty five years of marriage'<br>  <br>  "His response to her text message was PROMPT in fact it was so FAST he hadn't even turned on the tv'<br>  <br>  Last one.<br>  <br>  "when we INFLICT pain on animals we are FORCING our human needs ON TO THEM regardless of the pain.

nXSpS3Axaa	Werewolves, also known as lycanthropes from the Greek λυκ?νθρωπο?, λ?κο? (wolf) and ?νθρωπο? (human, man), are mythological or folkloric humans with the ability to shape shift into wolves or anthropomorphic wolf-like creatures, either purposely, by being bitten by another werewolf, or after being placed under a curse. This transformation is often associated with the appearance of the full moon, as popularly noted by the medieval chronicler Gervase of Tilbury, although it may have been recognized in earlier times among the ancient Greeks through the writings of Petronius.<br>  <br>  Werewolves are often granted extra-human strength and senses, far beyond those of both wolves or men. The werewolf is generally held as a European character, although its lore spread through the world in later times. Shape-shifters, similar to werewolves, are common in tales from all over the world, most notably amongst the American Indians, though most of them involve animal forms other than wolves.<br>  <br>  Werewolves are a frequent subject of modern fictional books, although fictional werewolves have been attributed traits distinct from those of original folklore, most notably the vulnerability to silver bullets. Werewolves continue to endure in modern culture and fiction, with books, films and television shows cementing the werewolf's stance as a dominant figure in horror.<br>  The word werewolf is thought to derive from Old English wer (or were) and wulf. The first part, wer, translates as "man" (in the sense of male human, not the race of humanity). It has cognates in several Germanic languages including Gothic wair, Old High German wer, and Old Norse verr, as well as in other Indo-European languages, such as Sanskrit 'vira', Latin vir, Irish fear, Lithuanian vyras, Spanish viril and varon, and Welsh g?r, which have the same meaning. The second half, wulf, is the ancestor of modern English "wolf"; in some cases it also had the general meaning "beast." An alternative etymology derives the first part from Old English weri (to wear); the full form in this case would be glossed as wearer of wolf skin.<br>  <br>  Vampires are mythological or folkloric revenants who subsist by feeding on the blood of the living. In folkloric tales, the undead vampires often visited loved ones and caused mischief or deaths in the neighbourhoods they inhabited when they were alive. They wore shrouds and were often described as bloated and of ruddy or dark countenance, markedly different from today's gaunt, pale vampire which dates from the early Nineteenth Century. Although vampiric entities have been recorded in most cultures, the term vampire was not popularised until the early 18th century, after an influx of vampire superstition into Western Europe from areas where vampire legends were frequent, such as the Balkans and Eastern Europe, although local variants were also known by different names, such as vampir (вампир) in Serbia, vrykolakas in Greece and strigoi in Romania. This increased level of vampire superstition in Europe led to mass hysteria and in some cases resulted in corpses actually being staked and people being accused of vampirism.<br>  <br>  In modern times, however, the vampire is generally held to be a fictitious entity, although belief in similar vampiric creatures such as the chupacabra still persists in some cultures. Early folkloric belief in vampires has been ascribed to the ignorance of the body's process of decomposition after death and how people in pre-industrial societies tried to rationalise this, creating the figure of the vampire to explain the mysteries of death. Porphyria was also linked with legends of vampirism in 1985 and received much media exposure, but this link has since been largely discredited.<br>  <br>  The English term was derived (possibly via French vampyre) from the German Vampir, in turn thought to be derived in the early 18th century from the Serbian.|`|6f812b070bb6a7494447f70abb1119fdaa	Every book, movie, or TV show that comes up adds its own "facts" to the myths.  So why would you need a reference?  Make it up.|`|BVQcBbmIaa	I did a lot of reading about Werewolf legends in my teens. I wish I could recall the books for you but I can tell you that most of the stories are recorded in rural france from the middle ages on till about the 18th century.<br>  <br>  A strong link with Ergot poisoning is believed to exist between apparent werewolf sightings and personal experiences of being werewolves. Ergot poisoning is also associated with European recordings of Witch craft. If you don't know what Ergot poisoning is then Google it. <br>  <br>  Ergot was a fungal infestation of Rye crops in Continental Europe. Rye was a staple crop for a long time so many people ate rye in some form daily. Ergot is very hallucinogenic.<br>  <br>  Other factors to consider are the increasingly publicised collections of rural folk and fairy tales gathered by folklorists and amateur historians like the Grimm brothers set as it was against a background of emerging nation-hoods such as Germany and France(Both once part of The Holy Roman Empire or simply lumped together as the Frankish Empire.)<br>  <br>  If you want a little insight into the history of Dracula (real and fantastical) then google Vlad the Impaler.<br>  <br>  Other sources for Both Vampyrism and werewolf stories can be found in Russian folklore. The russsians have their own Vampyre and werewolf mythology and the two are often intertwined. Shape shifting is another russian variant on the theme. Try googling shapeshifting or russian mythology or russian folk lore. Russia is a large multi racial territory so you will find lots of other interesting stuff not relating to vampyres or werewolves. Perservere and enjoy the other goodies you find.<br>  <br>  Shamanistic practises all over the earth and through all history are also another possible source of belief in Lycanthropy or shapeshifting. Again it's a big area to research but fascinating.<br>  <br>  Have fun. Happy hunting.<br>  <br>  You can also get a very shallow dip into werewolf and vampyre mythology by going to wikepedia as That Canadian Guy has done.(Verbatim) <br>  This will give you a very potted overview of werewolf and vampyre mythology.<br>  <br>  Personally I think you'll have more fun doing your own research and drawing your own conclusions.|`|XqcmZ7cDaa	Well they aren't real. However, the lagend probably surfaced from old diseases. i did a report in high school on the disease, it is easy to find. Jusy use google! But the legends are based on old diseases. Werevoles come from some hari disease, and symptoms can explain other thigs. Vampires, same thing, some old disease where it had something to do with blood, and the people with the diseases were sensative to the sun and could only run errands at night!

If it is, you must remove the quotes and put it in your own words. Thesis statments should NEVER contain a quote. <br>  Find another way to state "because words are not tangible items and therefore cannot be seized" without using "are" because is makes it passive, otherwise it sounds fine|`|AA11735935	Though the SC held that “the 4th amendment protects people not places”, wiretapping a public area does not constitute a search a seizure, because words are not tangible items and therefore nobody can seize them.<br>  <br>  ----------------------------<br>  <br>  There was only one passive.<br>  <br>  If you want to eliminate passives, first look for occurences of "is, am, are, was, were, be," or "been".  If the subject of that "be" form is not the actor of the sentence, and you have some verb with an -ed or -en ending, you very probably have a passive.  You then figure out what the actor was and flip the sentence around to active form.<br>  <br>  Your teacher has a common bias in reaction to the days when passives were advocated.  Passives are neither great or evil.  We use them in these cases:<br>  - when it doesn't matter who or what did something.<br>  - when we don't know who or what did something.<br>  - when we don't want to say who or what did something.<br>  and maybe most importantly<br>  - when we need to start the next sentence with its object because we just gave that information in the previous statement and we want a nice flow.<br>  <br>  If you are brave, give that list of functions to your teacher and ask if those are good times to use a passive form.

Unfortunately, you are stuck in that middle ground where your family isn't poor enough to qualify for government money but your family isn't wealthy enough to pay for your schooling.  Unless you get scholarships, you will end up having to take out student loans to pay for whatever you and your parents cannot pay for.  You do qualify for an unsubsidized Stafford loan, which will at least lower the impact of interest a little bit.|`|yGOmMQP7aa	How much you "owe" will not be determined by your EFC, but by your choice of schools.  The best way to determine how much a school costs is by looking at the posted tuition rates.<br>  <br>  With an EFC this high, you will not qualify for any state or federal grants, but will qualify for federal student loans.  The max you can borrow as a dependent freshman is 5,500 a year in Unsubsidized Stafford loans.  So this is how much you will "owe" if you decide to do loans.  However, if you choose a less expensive school, you may not need to even take out loans and you or your folks pay for it out of pocket.  <br>  <br>  Or, if you choose a school costing more than this (and remember some schools cost upwards of 40K a year) then you will "owe" 40K.  If your parents are willing to take out a parent PLUS loan for you, then you can do the 5,500 loan in your name and they can do the rest, 35K in their name.... which they will have to pay back.  Remember, each year you and your parents would have to get another loan.  Don't choose a school you cant afford for all 4 years.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.

NPtz1Y4Taa	“Only Thing We Have to Fear Is Fear Itself”: FDR’s First Inaugural Address<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Franklin D. Roosevelt had campaigned against Herbert Hoover in the 1932 presidential election by saying as little as possible about what he might do if elected. Through even the closest working relationships, none of the president-elect’s most intimate associates felt they knew him well, with the exception perhaps of his wife, Eleanor. The affable, witty Roosevelt used his great personal charm to keep most people at a distance. In campaign speeches, he favored a buoyant, optimistic, gently paternal tone spiced with humor. But his first inaugural address took on an unusually solemn, religious quality. And for good reason—by 1933 the depression had reached its depth. Roosevelt’s first inaugural address outlined in broad terms how he hoped to govern and reminded Americans that the nation’s “common difficulties” concerned “only material things.”|`|f8830aba1d653c00aa5f2a6bfb90aadbaa	I'm pretty sure that was Franklin D.

They tell Dally the story, and Dally, the toughest greaser, congratulates Johnny! This is followed immediately by the following description of Dally:  "The fight for self-preservation had hardened him against caring." <br>  <br>  P. 102:  In the hospital, after Dally and Johnny are hurt in the fire, and after the reporters leave, the doctor tells the boys that Dally will recover, but that Johnny's burns are bad, his back is broken and he may die.  Ponyboy thinks:  "I wanted to cry, but greasers don't cry in front of strangers. Some of us never cry at all. Like Dally and Two-Bit and Tim Shepard--they forgot how at an early age." <br>  <br>  P. 132:  Ponyboy arrives at the house and sees that the boys are dressed up and ready to fight the socs.  Ponyboy wonders: "What kind of a world is it where all I have to be proud of is a reputation for being a hood and greasy hair? I don’t want to be a hood, but even if I don’t steal things and mug people and get boozed up, I’m marked lousy. Why should I be proud of it? Why should I even pretend to be proud of it?"

I'm taking AP U.S History, and even my teacher recommended everyone to purchase it online. <br>  <br>  It not only contains major themes for each Chapter, but there's also detailed summary of everything. There's also multiple choice questions for each chapter along with a DBQ essay question and documents like the AP test. <br>  <br>  Doesn't it suck that the AP tests are $86 each! So much more expensive than SAT2. I hope you do good in your class and the test!

N2inIrs4aa	If the Teenager is responsible enough to be able to prioritize school and work then I say go for it.  As for should teens have to work and go to school, then I would say no.  From my experience School is first most about learning and getting an education.  Secondly it is about socializing with your peers, learning to get along (or not) but basically dealing with people.  It is possible to short change that experience when you get a job because you are too busy to spend time with your friends and enjoy life.  When I was a teenager I got a job at 15 and haven't stopped working ever since, I enjoyed having the extra money for dates and buying things, but looking back on it waiting a few extra years wouldn't have killed me.|`|yV8fog7Paa	I want to, but I need to keep up my grades which this semester is hard. <br>  I'm 16.|`|Vm1DndWsaa	If they want to they should be able to.

2646a4e9d6d4e936660d70ff922397f3aa	An undergraduate is someone working toward an associate's or bachelor's degree - within the first four years of college.  A graduate student is someone who has already gotten a bachelor's degree and is now working on a master's or doctorate of some sort.  I'm not sure I understand your second question - do you mean what kind of degree would someone in a teaching position have?  In that case, it depends on the level the person is teaching and the school at which they are teaching.  Pretty much all elementary school and high school teachers have undergraduate (bachelor's) degrees, and an increasing number also have master's (graduate) degrees.  If the person is teaching at a community college, they would need at least a master's degree, and possibly a Ph.D. (graduate degree).  For someone teaching full-time at a four-year college, they would almost certainly have a doctorate.|`|eWObKmBSaa	I believe an undergraduate hasn't gotten her Masters diploma yet.<br>  Yes, you can teach with a BA or BS, four yrs of college.|`|a10dd58c91da82fecb358a8854409149aa	you can attain a teaching position with an undergraduate (4 year degree).  <br>  Graduate means you go to college after attaining an undergrad (2-3 years if full time.)|`|db8T2vsEaa	Depending on what you would like to teach you have the option of completing a relevant undergraduate course and then whats called a PGCE.

mZNesA53aa	El ser humano tiene la disposición de aprender -de verdad- sólo aquello a lo que le encuentra sentido o lógica. El ser humano tiende a rechazar aquello a lo que no le encuentra sentido. El único auténtico aprendizaje es el aprendizaje  significativo, el aprendizaje con sentido. Cualquier otro aprendizaje será puramente mecánico, memorístico, coyuntural: aprendizaje para aprobar un examen, para ganar la materia, etc. El aprendizaje significativo es un aprendizaje relacional.

8oCwrIR2aa	You can do it many ways.

Highlight the range B8:K8 and click Copy, then go to the answering page and click on the first cell available for this answer. Now click Paste which places the original numbers in the row starting in the clicked cell. Finally, click Paste|Special, hunt for and click in the little bullet hole next to "Multiply" and press Enter.<br>  <br>  And done! If you wanted to multiply such a range by, say 48.449576, you would have pasted the original set so as to absolutely accurately define the range on the answering page, then type "48.449576" into one of them, copy and paste it to the rest and then re-copy the original set of numbers and do the Paste|Special thing again. As you can see, it multiplies the clipboard contents by whatever is in each cell. (The original problem put the numbers you wanted to square in those cells, not "48.449576," so that when you did the Multiply thing you squared them.)<br>  <br>  If you wish, of course, you could use a formula like "=B8^2" and copy and paste it to the range where you desire the answers. This is a little more "permanent" than the other way and for empty cells in the original range you end up with zeroes showing in the answer area. This is probably the most common way to approach it, but as mentioned, it has a couple issues.<br>  For instance, perhaps you have a row of numbers (or a column, but I'll say row so people see it works either way — for that matter, it could be several rows and columns or even a batch of cells individually marked with Ctrl-click) that you want to square. Maybe cells B8:K8. You want the squares to appear on an answering page in the test (a test given as a spreadsheet one interacts with). Highlight the range B8:K8 and click Copy, then go to the answering page and click on the first cell available for this answer. Now click Paste which places the original numbers in the row starting in the clicked cell. Finally, click Paste|Special, hunt for and click in the little bullet hole next to "Multiply" and press Enter.<br>  <br>  And done!

g3AM6QSVaa	You write that this "test" is impossible. No one should be just giving you the answers to a TEST. Also, my 9 year old son got all but 1 of these answers correct, so it's far from "impossible".<br>  Read your chapter & Good luck!

If you are seeking work in a manufacturing based organization, then yes, a degree in business and engineering is best.  However, if you are looking to become a quality assurance person in the medical field, then a nursing degree may be best.  So it greatly depends on what industry you think that you want to get into.<br>  <br>  Another consideration is to seek professional certifications.  They are not a substitute for a degree, but can be used in the meantime until you finish your formal education program.  The best place to look for quality assurance professional certifications is the American Society for Quality.  There are a number of areas that you can get "certified" in and there are many programs available as well as self study that can help you earn one of these professional recognitions.<br>  <br>  Now the other question that you did not ask - If you need a four year college degree, where?  The what is dependent on the career path or organization that you may want to get into.  There are also many schools that offer any number of levels of quality assurance programs.<br>  <br>  A couple of good places to research schools is either the ASQ Quality Progress magazine (the monthly publication of ASQ - it does cost money to get as you need to joint the organization) or a free magazine called Quality Digest.  Go to the link below and request a free subscription to QD and they will have various adds and references to schools and what is being offered out there.<br>  <br>  I would also suggest calling the ASQ - 800-248-1946 and asking if there is a Section/Chapter (local member groups) in your area.  If there is, get a contact name and number and call that person.  They should invite you to attend some of their local meeting where you will be able to talk to people about what they know that is local and how good those programs are.<br>  <br>  This should be a good starting point.|`|TMkhlCCTaa	I work in Quality Control but the department upstairs is Quality Assurance.  For any of it they want people with science degrees; Biology, Chemistry, we even have one guy with a Farm Management degree.  Also, there are several engineers that start in that department.  An employer mostly just wants people with some science background so they can make chemicals, are familiar with scientific equipment and basic lab safety.|`|AA10018798	any 4 year degree, but must include at least 30 units from business classes or accounting classes
u63HhNUAaa	re: friar.   sounds good to me<br>  re: cook.  in those days, ulcers were believed by some to be caused by poison food.  if the cook got his ulcer from eating his own food, was it really safe?
