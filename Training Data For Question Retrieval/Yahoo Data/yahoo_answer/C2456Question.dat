20090225023535AAW7oyj	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Can you suggest a book series for me?	I love books with amixed genre, and my favourite is fantasy, but not so much that's it's totally far fetched.    Favourite books:   Lord of the rings   The constant princess   the other boleyn girl   the boleyn inheritance   the twilight saga   the host   no greater love    elsewhere      you get my drift, any suggestions?

20090225023616AAx82iP	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Do you like this Harry Potter vs Twilight parody?	I just wanna know if there is any point in continuing. Don't mind the Rosalie and Emmett one...it was so lame. The best is yet to come [so is the worst].          Also it just captures how all the characters are going to be fighting/practicing, and in the end there will be a huge fight [at DAWN]

20090225024636AA6zeNK	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Care to read a short story? Or what may develop into a short story?	I feel like I've written all I can for now, but I will probably continue with this. But let me know what you think thus far. Thanks.         The sun woke me up. I had no blinds or curtains, so the sun always woke me up. I could sleep with it there for a little while, but after too long, it just became too difficult. I prefer clouds, personally. Especially in the winter. The sun in winter was a false hope. It would cheer you up until you stepped outside. You still needed a damn jacket.   I turned on the lamp, even though I didn’t need it. The room was bright already. I didn’t really want to get out of bed, but if I didn’t now, I might never. The kitchen was a real mess. The whole house was, really, but the kitchen especially. I was beginning to get a headache from being in that place. I had to get out.    I got dressed and brushed my hair. Looking in the mirror made things worse. I looked like a slob. I lived like a slob. I really had to get out of there.  Just for a walk.   The city was very busy, because it was Saturday. I hated living in the city. Everyone was too easy to figure out. I could see a man in a business suit walking by, and know what he was thinking. Not because I’m psychic or anything. Everyone in the city was just too easy to figure out.    There was a family walking in front of me, the parents and a small boy. That’s something you don’t see often. Families walking downtown, all together. Usually people are too busy. This particular family was walking slowly, though, so I thought I’d walk past them. But I decided not to as I got closer to them, because suddenly, this family was very interesting to me. They weren’t speaking to each other. Just walking. The mother was holding the hand of the boy, and the father was just walking next to the mother. But very closely. They never said a word, not even the little boy. I followed them all the way to the park.    I started crying, because the family depressed me. Then the pigeons depressed me. And the trees, that looked very beautiful blowing in the wind, depressed me. I needed to sit down, because I couldn’t breathe well. I found a bench under a tree, and closed my eyes very tightly.   The ground was still. The air was thick and cold. I couldn’t blink; I’d forgotten my eyes were closed. My lungs felt dry and cracked, and every breath I took felt like inhaling dry ice. Perhaps the desert floor felt similar when a cold breeze whipped through it, stirring up dirt and slapping it in the face. But I couldn’t know. How could I?   I considered the fact that I may be insane.  I’d considered it before. Either way, I was convinced that no other person had ever felt like I did. Or perhaps thought like I did. My thoughts were too much for my mind to handle. They seemed like tangible objects taking up too much space in my head. I always felt like that, but it was getting harder to act like I didn’t.   I looked around and realized that people were staring at me. They looked worried, and I hated them for it. The park was no place to go insane, so I stood up and started walking. I wasn’t sure where to go. It felt like the middle of the night, but the sun was shining above my head.   I felt a hand on my shoulder. “Excuse me, miss?”  I turn around to see a middle aged man staring back at me. I looked at him for awhile. He looked worried.   “Hm?”  I mumbled. I hadn’t meant to sound annoyed, but I was, and it showed.   “Um, is there,” he paused. He didn’t seem to know what to say. “Is there somebody I can call for you? You’re shaking pretty badly.”   “What? No. No, I’m just cold.” I walked away quickly, though I couldn’t help but glance back. He was still just standing there, like an idiot. I hated him.

Open to suggestions...especially on line breaks      The Dog      She turned from the   window and met my anger   with her eighty-one years.   Clothed in the wisdom   of the indignant she   muttered then...      "It's colder than a   coal-miners butt out there".      And I knew,    right then,    that I had lost the argument.      My shoulders sagged, then shook.   I turned my head away,   shamed by my own laughter.   Feigning resignation and   ill-humor,       I told her    to let the    damn dog    in.

20090225025533AAqTPBa	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	I would like some feedback of a excerpt of a short story im writing?	the clipping is of a romance part of the story. its taken somewhat out of context, so im looking more for feedback of the formation of thoughts as well as the storytelling. the "a, b, and c" in the story in italic font represents characters i have yet to name of develop. any constructive crit is appreciated. the word family here means a strong group of friends. it is only a draft so far, so don't expect any extremely beautiful grammar.      "Look at me" she said as I started to walk away from her and everything I left behind so long ago. "Look at me!!!" she said again, this time much louder. It wasn’t her voice, but the echo of her voice which screamed through the night air that sent a cold chill through my soul. I couldn’t help but to look back at her. Then I walked back. She completed her sentence. "…like you used to" her eyes were glassy. She was so strong. But she couldn’t fight the tears back any longer. I had little time to word exactly how I felt. I let my words flow. "For so long, you have looked at me with that pain in your eyes. and even now, there is nothing I can do".   "What do I have to do to make you look at me again, the way you used to, to look at a again the way you used to. At b. at c. to look at you family again.. Then her words became almost mumbles. The emotions and tears were vividly carried through the words. What do I have to do? What do I have to do, she said again. Silence entered. For what it seemed was so long, silence stayed. "Why did you come back", she mumbled, tears still streaking down her face. I had no answer..so she answered for me. "It’s because you couldn’t let go. You can’t let go. And now you’re holding on more than ever”. As she said that, her head fell on my chest. The weeping now turned to cries. She asked again, her face against my chest, this time as if she was whispering to my heart, “What do I have to do”.   "You have done enough. Now, lay your head and rest”. The three forbidden words weren’t needed to be said as I pushed myself away from her, and walked away into the silence of the cold dark night. It started to rain.      excerpt 2: this i actually plan to place far early in the story.   ...so i let my words flow.   "i missed you...a lot. for some reason, you were the only one i was able to think of. not a. not b. not even the people i pledged to protect. heh. i often found myself asking if you were thinking of me, as i was about you."   i found myself looking down. i was embarrassed by what i said. i sounded like such a loser and so desperate. i was thinking about things too much and too fast again until my thoughts broke as she started talking.   "i did think of you. i thought i was just being a little girl...but now with what you've told me...ive missed you, very much, almost too much."   i went blank. all i could do now was stare through her in amazement. i found myself looking down again, but this time with a smile on my face.   "thank you", she said.   "for what?"   "for missing me."   i let out a breath of a laugh."why wouldnt i miss you?"   "why would you?"   "i love you". as i said that everything went silent. even the wind that was blowing her beautiful red hair against her face died down. her eyes seemed almost empty. it felt like time itself stopped.   "..."   i knew i had to say something. i couldn't help what i just said. i had to change this moment. i had to make something out of this. i had to recover from this mistake.   "i hope that didn't come out too cheesy. i spent the whole trip back trying to word that right without sounding so--"   "hey..stop talking." she cut me off. i was ready for a verbal lashing. i felt terrible and sick. after all she went through, i should be aware of her feelings. it was so obvious. what was i thinking. was i thinking? these thoughts raced through my head so fact that i COULDN'T think. i attempted to stumble for words, but before i could say anything, she finished what she started saying.   "i love you too."   i felt like i went dead.

The Stone Bench      I sat upon the stone bench in the court yard,   Oblivious to Spring scents in the air.   Lost in contemplation of my future,   Mindless of the blossoms dancing there.      When summer came I thought to find a shading,   An Elm perhaps to shield me from the sun.   Yet caught within the turmoil I remained there,    Still sitting on the bench where I'd begun.      As Fall threw shadows 'pon the lawn I trembled,   And still I made no move to step inside.   Hues may have beguiled, I don't remember,   Drowning in the tears that I had cried.      Then Winter came and touched her icy fingers,   And shivering it came upon me then.   What could have been had fallen to the seasons,   So lost was I in what once might have been.      Insight may be gained through contemplation,   Yet too much thought can be our own damnation.

20090225042520AAtL0WO	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	I really need help with a book title?	I remember reading a book about 3/4 years ago and it was brilliant. I lent it to a girl i worked with at the time and never got it back. I would love to get it again but can't remember the name of it.      I hope you can help.      The story as i remember it is about a religious group trying to follow the path of a soul to see the other side. They have been killing people in the name of this great experiment.      That is until they find a woman who is contacted by her twin, who died. The woman has very bad nightmares followed by headaches i think, which is why she goes to a specialist clinic. Where she becomes the latest experiment candidate for the religious group. Her twins soul visits her in these dreams and the religious group try to follow it when she awakes.      They finally get the information that they need to follow a souls path after death and the Red Pope kills himself on his last web cast. The group have tracked his soul to the afterlife and he comes back and tells everyone what he has seen.      The reason the Red Pope started the quest was to prove beyond all doubt that his followers were going to a better place after death. however, because he had sanctioned all those deaths and then killed himself, he went to hell.      I really appreciate any help you can give me. I thought the book might have been called The Lazarus Code but when i have searched this title it gives me different stories and none match the one i remember.      Please Help!!

20090225053211AA0EDL7	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	COMMENT WHAT DO YOU GUYS THIN ABOUT THIS POEM ?	Witches Groom      I walked out in the night, my hand’s soon froze      The air was so chilled it sank deep to my bones.      I happened to notice her standing there      The cold wind wiping her long dark hair      I approached her with a gentle smile      “My dear have you been waiting a while?”      She turned to me with feline eyes      Her beauty took me by surprise      I realized I was staring rudely      She laughed, smiled, and beckoned to me      The intoxicating smell as I drew close      She introduced herself simply as “Rose”      The gown she wore was elegant black lace      It fit her devlish curves with grace      She slipped her slender arms through mine      Her soft word purrs that made me sigh      She led me smiling down the street      A black cat darted past our feet      Frogs mocking croaked somewhere near      Whispers of shadows filled my ear      Slightly fearful I hesitated      The world around us evaporated      Only the dark pavement remained below      Covered in feathers from a poor black crow      Blinking I asked if all was well      She smiled dangerously “It’s just a spell,”      Like a puppet I could not resist      The world vanished in her deceiving mist      I wondered briefly what she lacked      The classic old broom or the crocked black hat?      She released me as we reached the end      A creeping black widow fell from my hand      I tried to run but it was too late      Her voodoo doll controlled my fate      We stood now among several graves      In her hand appeared a shiny curved blade      And I her sacrifice soon to be      To increase the power of her magic x3      Her ferocity over, I was thrown in a tomb      My name soon forgotten, a black witches groom.

Am I correct here?

You gotta start somewhere!      I'm just looking for genuine advice on how to go about acting, as I am seriously considering it and I don't want to take wrong directions and waste my time. Thanks.

20090225044616AAc7G1Q	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Several years ago I loved a boy...?	He likes me too. However everything kept us from being together.   Today he sent a message, let's just call it a message though it is not, I am so happy. We are unlikely to marry or even go out. But I still feel thankful to him for he loves me.   And I wrote: fly, up to the sky, let wei(name) shine   When the dusk goes, the night falls, it feels so private to me.   It's a cold day, it makes people chilly, but it makes me feel bouyant.   I feel so good, I feel so wonderful, I want to sing alone, alone but still grateful.      One day I feel like suicide, the other day I'm here feeling the wonderfulness.   Amazing is the life you give me, my god, I am a little thankful.      God, my beloved, are you there? I have so many questions to ask, and still so many secrets to confess.   God please lead my way before me, I feel wonderful. Where upto my lifeline leads, where on my destiny lies?      Whenever I imagine, whenever I perceive the vistas of future, I can hardly breathe. Is it true that it could be beautiful? DON'T ANSWER!   Don't answer even for once a time you can speak to your creature, I am happy and I am zealot to find out who is the Mr right waiting for me there.   Don't lie to me, and don't play me like a game, I'm no prey, I'm a sweet girl.   I am no woman of man, I am a intellectual individual.   I am no human of society, I am a fairy goddess in the air.   I am no creature of you highness, I am a part of nature.      Are you listen to me my god and my beloved no one. Here I am lying alone feeling the whole world.   Never mind the cracks of a fire, never mind the vibration of machines, never mind the people outside shouting and laughing. I am here on my own, and later I will never find a chance to be with myself 'cause I am going there, what should I say about it? A fair world, a furious world, or a folly world? Still great, still shines for me to think about my future.      What do you think about what I wrote?

I'm taking a class on Tolkien and today in my final exam, one of the questions was to describe what/whom a certain word was, and their importance. Test is long over, but its driving me crazy.      The who/what was "Nun" C something, like "Nun Cirimil" or something like that. I don't remember exactly and I couldn't take the test with me to check later.       Anyone have a clue as to what this is? Maybe a place in Tolkien? its most likely related to something in the last four books of "The Lord of the Rings".

" day, because of this whole Literary Festival in Dubai.        I'd like to dress up as Bella (You saw that coming, didn't you? :P ). No, not because I'm crazy about the character, but because I could just wear normal clothing and say I'm Bella Swan! :O      (Who I would really like to dress up as, would be Willy Wonka from Charlie And The Chocolate Factory xD, odd choice? Come on, you've gotta love him! Unfortunately, I don't have clothing like him and it's too late to start lookin' around.)      Now, that I've kind of decided which character I'm going to be, I still need advice on what I should wear. I was thinking of a blue prom dress (which I don't have) and maybe making my leg look like it's broken? O_o      So, here is what you could do to help me out.      Please. .    1) let me know the exact description of what Bella usually wears, or what she was wearing in your favourite scene. (The prom for example)      2) Suggest any other book characters, famous ones please. . I need to know a little about them to be able to come up with a costume. (Pictures could be very helpful ^__^ )      Here is a list of books I've read recently.      1) The Kite Runner.   2) A Thousand Splendid Suns.   3) The Twilight Series.   4) Ps. I love you.   5) The Chronicles Of Narnia (Read them like in grade 3, but I still wanted to mention it. One of my favourites.)   6) The Secret Life Of Bees   7) The Silver Sword.       Thank you! :)

20090225053514AA2m9eq	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Please read this story and rate??(its short)?	Hello,i want to help and encourage my friend in completing a story she wrote and i decided to paste some of the pages here and please rate and tell me what do you think and is it worth it to continue and BTW SHES JUST 13 AND ITS HER FIRST STORY !!!!!         1                    I lay down in bed, with soundless tears streaming endlessly down my cheeks. Pictures of my parents rolled in my head, which reminded me of pleasant memories. I didn’t know if I could do this. I didn’t know if I could bare the responsibility that hung on my shoulders.      My dad passed away a month ago, which left my mother to parent us, my thirteen year old sister, Grace, and me. She wasn’t able to handle the loss of her beloved husband and the single-parenting of two teenaged daughters, which struck her. She had a history of high blood pressure, which sent her to the hospital. She couldn’t bear the loneliness any more, and joined dad in heaven, just a day before my eighteenth birthday, leaving me in charge of my thirteen year old sister.      As a legal adult, I got custody on Grace, and the social services sent an employee to check on us every month or so.      They informed me that I had to get a decent job and manage to give Grace a happy living. Right now, I have a half-time job, a server in a fast food restaurant, and I have applied for another, in an bookstore.      I ****** my head to look at the time on the digital watch on my side table. 7:03, it said.      I rubbed the tears away, and got off the bed and strolled down the corridor to Grace’s room. I cracked the door just the tiniest bit to see if she was awake. She was fully dresses and was lying on the bed on her torso, legs crossed in the air, reading a book.      When she saw me, her eyes popped out of her sockets.      “Angela? Why are your eyes so puffy?” she questioned.      I doubted whether to tell her or not. Grace was very emotional about mum and dad passing away, and I tried very hard to not let her see me when I was having an emotional breakdown.      “From sleeping,” I croaked, in what I hoped was a convincing answer.      “Oh.” She looked relieved but there was the faintest trace of suspicion on her face. She looked down and continued reading.      Grace had beautiful green eyes and golden brown hair that hung to her shoulders. She was medium-sized and athletic. I believed that she was going to be very difficult for me to handle, like those troubled teenage kids that you saw on TV, but Grace didn’t give me a hard time at all. She helped me with chores, did her studying and homework, and got A’s in all her exams and assignments. She was really comfortable to be around.      “Get ready for breakfast,” I reminded her. She nodded and continued reading.      I headed to the bathroom and took a warm, rapid shower. I brushed my teeth, wrapped myself in a towel and went to my room. I took out a pink sweater and a pair of jeans, put them on, and combed my long brown hair. I tied it up in a high ponytail, and stared at myself in the mirror. I saw a wide-eyed girl staring back at me with light brown eyes, the faintest trace of puffiness, surrounding her eyes. A few brown hair strands were out of place. Her hand reached out and adjusted them. I quickly made the bed and went downstairs.      Grace was waiting at the table when I arrived. I quickly made her some scrambled eggs and poured her some orange juice, which she eyed appreciatively. I made myself some hot coco and went through the mail on the counter.      One was from the social services, which I kept for last. Another was from some distant relatives. I ripped the envelope open and pulled the letter out. It contained the usual, the how are you’s and if you need any help just give us a call’s. I put it aside, and gave it an appreciative look, promising myself to answer to that after I got back from college.      I went through the rest and stopped at the last envelope. It was from the bookstore. I hastily opened the envelope and started reading.      I felt Grace’s stare on my face. This was it. We desperately needed money. “YES!” I exclaimed. Grace ran over to me.      “Congratulations!” she shouted happily as she ran over to hug me. I hugged her back.      “Come on, let’s tell Amy the great news.”      “Let’s.”      Amy Carter was my best friend since eighth grade. We met on the first day in Art class, and we have been close friends since then.      Her parents were over helpful towards Grace and me. They brought us lunch sometimes, sent Amy over to help us with chores and groceries, and offered to our school funds, which I refused immediately.      I grabbed my keys, backpack and the unopened social services letter.      I jumped into the car, placed the key in the ignition, and turned the engine on. The car was a gift from my parents that I got when I received my driving license.      It was a pleasant day in the middle of October. Dry leaves covered the ground. The sun was hidden between white, fluffy clouds. I rolled the windows down to let the cool breeze in.      W

Hi, I am doing my degree in ancient history and archaeology and have it in mind to continue to get my qualifications (i.e. PhD, etc) once my degree is finished, so that I may become an ancient history lecturer. I am confident that I'm good enough at the history itself (without being cocky :D), but am a poor linguist, and hence cannot read or speak either of the ancient languages. Would this be a problem if I wanted to follow my dream of becoming an academic in this area? A while ago someone told me that it might be, but I want to hear some other opinions, just in case they were wrong. Anybody out there with experience of academic classics? Many thanks!

20090225054122AAmGi9u	Arts & Humanities;History	Great seal of the usa and the new world order?	It is often said that the reverse of the Great Seal of the United States of America contains the star of the devil. Take the A of "Annuit", S of "C?ptis" and the second O of "Ordo", join them in a triangle. Then take the N of "Novus", the M of "Seclorum" and the eye of providence, getting another triangle. There is therefore a star of david. However, some says that a star of david contained within a circle is actually the star of the devil. Also, the words used to make the star spells out MASON, one of the 120 possible word combinations of the mottos. Anyway, the mottos have also caused controversy, often seen as the new world order.       I am not stating anything as the truth here. I am just retelling what some says, and wish for the intellectual community to give an unbiased view of this subject: whether the Great Seal of the USA is indeed an allusion to the New World Order. Please give evidence too. Thank You.

The book is about a couple of snot-nosed punks (one of whom is dead inside and soulless, the other's a vampire). Neither are particularly pleasant, and both are constantly whining about the unfairness of this or that.

20090202084659AAKWzgc	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	What say you to a poem of reliving?	"Not Meant"      Glancing off my heart,   like raindrops on glass,   all seen as though felt,   distant.      Echoes of live lived once,   knowing I've been there;   knowing I've seen. it. all. before...   before this final life that shouldn't be.      Apathy and passion   blended one.   Zest for purer life and knowledge of the   world wanting to kill.      Smudges on a DVD,   cutting scenes and dialogue and plot.   Far from the beginning,   theme askew, delusion and confliction,   new characters, same story, and me...   lost...      at least   the ending   stays the same.
20090225060023AARtczC	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Hearts curse ... have fun pulling this to bits.?	Open your heart, said the voice from within,   Let your love flow free,   Unlock the doors that keep you safe,   A comfort unto thee.      Do not hide behind a mask of friendship,   While burning desire is quelled,   Yet lose yourself with passion abound,   The scent of love is spell-ed.      The scars that shame this heart of yours,   So sacred a place for you,   Without the healing touch of love,   Will never be renewed.      Would you climb a place on lofty high?   To protect your heart so dear,   Place boundaries around your endless love,   Let no-one come so near.      Have you let the darkness rule your life?   Afraid of who may see,   Do you push away your hearts” love beat”,   Instead of feeling free.

20090225052934AA0D5oF	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	What do you think of this quote?	Ever since I was younger I used to watch the comedy series Boy Meets World. Now that I'm 21, I often ask myself a question from that series.       "If you let peoples perception of you dictate your behavior, you will never grow as a person...But if you leave yourself open to experience despite what others think, then you will learn and grow and when you grow and mature then you can rub there smug little earing wearing noses in it."      What I'm trying to say is when your passionate about something you try and master will you eventually learn. My biggest dream is to learn how to play guitar and really learn, play my favorite oldies songs and maybe one day teach other people to play if God gave me the will. I have the passion, hunger, will to succeed however, I often find myself practicing and ask myself will I ever learn? I practice on a regular basis,almost daily and know the basic chords.I can even play Pretty Woman by Roy Orbinson and other parts of songs, but I want to do this for a living someday.  Do people who eventually dedicate there life to something eventually grow closer to it or are some not destined to achice a certain goal?

20090203145659AAN1xL6	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	Who was the narcissist on the Collins submarine computerization effort ? (There MUST have been one or more)?	Who was the narcissist in your workplace?   Question:      Is narcissism "contagious"? Can one "catch" narcissism by living with a narcissist?      Answer:      The psychiatric profession uses the word: "epidemiology" when it describes the prevalence of psychopathologies. There is some merit in examining the incidence of personality disorders in the general population. Mental health is the visible outcome of an intricate interplay between nature and nurture, genetics and culture, the brain and one's upbringing and socialization.       Yet are personality disorders communicable diseases?      The answer is more complex than a simple "yes" or "no". Personality disorders are not contagious in the restricted, rigorous, medical sense. They are not communicated by pathogens from one individual to another. They lack many of the basic features of physical-biological epidemics. Still, they are communicated.      First, there is the direct, interpersonal, influence.      A casual encounter with a narcissist is likely to leave a bad aftertaste, bewilderment, hurt, or anger. But these transient reactions have no lasting effect and they fade with time. Not so with more prolonged interactions: marriage, partnership, cohabitation, working or studying together and the like.      Narcissism brushes off. Our reactions to the narcissist, the initial ridicule, the occasional rage, or the frustration – tend to accumulate and form the sediment of deformity. Gradually, the narcissist distorts the personalities of those he is in constant touch with, casts them in his defective mould, limits them, redirects them, and inhibits them. When sufficiently cloned, the narcissist uses the people he affected as narcissistic proxies, narcissistic vehicles of vicarious narcissism.      The narcissist provokes in us emotions, which are predominantly negative and unpleasant. The initial reaction, as we said, is likely to be ridicule. The narcissist, pompous, incredibly self-centred, falsely grandiose, spoiled and odd (even his manner of speech is likely to be constrained and archaic), often elicits smirks in lieu of admiration.      But the entertainment value is fast over. The narcissist's behaviour becomes tiresome, irksome and cumbersome. Ridicule is supplanted by ire and, then, by overt anger. The narcissist's inadequacies are so glaring and his denial and other defence mechanisms so primitive that we constantly feel like screaming at him, reproaching him, or even striking at him literally as well as figuratively.      Ashamed at these reactions, we begin to also feel guilty. We find ourselves attached to a mental pendulum, swinging between repulsion and guilt, rage and pity, lack of empathy and remorse. Slowly we acquire the very characteristics of the narcissist that we so deplore. We become as tactless as he is, as devoid of empathy and of consideration, as ignorant of the emotional makeup of other people, and as one track minded. Exposed in the sick halo of the narcissist, we have been "infected".      The narcissist invades our personality. He makes us react the way he would have liked to, had he dared, or had he known how (a mechanism known as "projective identification"). We are exhausted by his eccentricity, by his extravagance, by his grandiosity, by his constant entitlement.      The narcissist incessantly, adamantly, even aggressively makes demands upon his human environment. He is addicted to his Narcissistic Supply: admiration, adoration, approval, attention. He forces others to lie to him and over-rate his achievements, his talents, and his merits. Living in a narcissistic fantasyland, he compels his closest, nearest and dearest to join him there.      The resulting exhaustion, desperation and weakening of the will are fully taken advantage of by the narcissist. He penetrates these reduced defences and, like a Trojan horse, spews forth his lethal charge. Gradually, those in proximity to him, find themselves imitating and emulating his personality traits. The narcissist also does not refrain from intimidating them into compliance with his commands.      The narcissist coerces people around him by making subtle uses of processes such as reinforcement and conditioning. Seeking to avoid the unpleasant consequences of not succumbing to his wishes, people would rather put up with his demands and be subjected to his whims. Not to confront his terrifying rages, they "cut corners", pretend, participate in his charade, lie, and become subsumed in his grandiose fantasies.      Rather than be aggressively nagged, they reduce themselves and minimise their personalities. By doing all this – they delude themselves that they have escaped the worst consequences.      But the worst is yet to come. The narcissist is confined, constrained, restrained and inhibited by the unique structures of his personality and of his disorder. There are many behaviours which he cannot engage in, many reactions and actions "prohibited", many desires stifled, many fears insurmountable.      The narci

Mine is going to be about someone getting upducted by alians. Well I just need some tips on how write my story. Also is this a good idea:      I want to write my story like "It is 6am and he is looking through his telascope and he sees an alian...." and just keep saying he and then at the very end I want to say "Once you are back on earth you can't tell anyone of your experiences. Millions of people are ubduced by alians every day. Who is he, his could be anyone." or something similar. Is that too coufusing, should I do that?? Thanks!!

20090203144911AA980i9	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	Tough question...who's up for it? ;) ?	The Problem of the Light Switch: I have an ordinary light switch connected to a light. When the switch is closed, the light is on. When the switch is open, the light is off. At two minutes to noon, the light is on. At one minute to noon I flip the switch, turning the light off. At half a minute to noon I flip it again, turning the light on. At a quarter of a minute before noon I flip it again, turning the light off. I continue in this way, cutting the time between flippings of the switch in half each time. Now this will be an infinite series of flips. The switch flippings will occur closer and closer to noon, but will all be completed before noon. Will the switch be on or off at noon?      Good luck :)

Anyway, I'd really appreciate some input, just opinions or suggestions or anything really. I'd love to hear interpretations too, thanks :)    Rain    I met you on a Monday,  The day the world began.  We stood there on the barren soil,  A part of someones plan.    That somebody, up there, it seems,  With happiness, began to cry.  And tears were dancing at our feet,  Cascading from the sky.    And me, not understanding,  Hunched down and cursed the rain.  The crying stopped a bit, but then   It welled back up again.    That somebody watched over us  And all the world that lay below,  Which thrived and blossomed all the while.  I sat with you and watched it grow.    And soon the world was blooming,  Just as the plan intended.  You planted kisses on my cheeks  And still, the rain descended.    And then one day, I understood  That person from above.  And rain was dancing round my eyes  The day I fell in love.

20090202103230AAq4Uy5	Arts & Humanities;Performing Arts	How dangerous is it to persue the goal of becoming a successful screenwriter?	Please only answer this question if you truly have the knowledge to. I will be graduating next year (i.e. summer 2010) and am seriously considering career choices. My desire to become a screenwriter is not due, as many may assume, to poor academic performance- as a matter of fact, I usually receive top grades in the sciences as well, but inspiring people by showing them things they may relate to is where my heart is. On the other hand, my choices have not triggered positive reactions in people who care about me, and I have heard that indiviuals who aim for achievement in the domain of art usually end up on the streets. I strongly believe in my ability to produce movie scripts to die for, and I do not lack the genius either, but my advisers apparently have no faith in me. So, what are my chances of joining the homeless in the name of having a dream?

Hi, i remember reading this book years ago, but I can't remember what it is called or even what it is about really. All I remember is it has something to do with river logging and the characters all travel down the rivers on boats. It is set probably somewhere in the 1800's or early 1900's. The main character is a kid that goes to work with these loggers or w/e they are. One of the main guys has a French name like Le Moner or something. When I read this I was kind of young, so it shouldn't be for more than 8-15 year olds.      I know the details are crappy but thats really all I recall. Any help is very much appreciated.      Thanks.

20090225064025AA3CsZy	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	Is there an aesops fable for or some similar piece of philosophical advice for procrastination?	i have a friend who let her aunt take care of her daughter for two weeks while she moved out of town and looked for a job, when it was time for her aunt to give her back she declined saying that she would be too far away and now my friend has to go through the courts and im looking for some sort of philosophical advice i can give her to give her aunt that she is just delaying the inevitable and in doing so is surely sealing the worst possible outcome for herself and will probably not have a part in her life.

20090203143522AAlwAqx	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Please help! read my poem please!!!!!?	okay so i have to include at least six of these in my poem.   imagery  metaphor  theme  connotation  figurative language  symbolism  allusion  personification  simile  tone hyperbole  mood    do i have them?? heres my poem:  Metamorphosis  Hundreds of eggs are waiting to hatch.  Smaller than beads, and hard to snatch.  A fuzzy little caterpillar emerges so scared,  Chewing up all the leaves, yet no one cares.  Munching and crunching as it inches up the tree,  Getting as much as it can is the key.  Dodging and dashing from the screeching bird,  Planning its escape in fear of being heard.  Its brown and yellow and more fragile than glass  Its only wish is for this stage to pass.  As its wish comes true, and its ready to spin,  For seven to twenty days it will lie within.  The silky looking threads that make up this shell,  Is where this caterpillar will temporarily dwell.  When fifteen days have gone and passed,  The reflection in the water leaves the butterfly aghast.  There is elegance and intricacy in the delicate wings,  Beauty to the world is what this butterfly brings.    This profound process appears extremely gorgeous,  But, most people call it metamorphosis.
20090203143349AAAoSGq	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	English/poem help????? 10 points please...?	I am reading a selection below and I can't understand it. Please help me out by answering the questions below???            Dead Men Tell No Tales      THEY say that dead men tell no tales!       Except of barges with red sails   And sailors mad for nightingales;      Except of jongleurs stretched at ease   Beside old highways through the trees; 5      Except of dying moons that break   The hearts of lads who lie awake;      Except of fortresses in shade,   The hearts of lads who lie awake;      Except of fortresses in shade,   And heroes crumbled and betrayed.       But dead men tell no tales, they say! 10      Except old tales that burn away   The stifling tapestries of day:      Old tales of life, of love and hate,   Of time and space, and will, and fate.       —Haniel Long      14. Why is the poem ironic?       because the title and refrain contradict the meaning   because the speaker displays verbal irony   because the tone of the poem is wry   because readers are aware of information that the speaker does not know      15. What is the relationship of the title to the theme of the poem?       The title expresses the theme.   The title contradicts the theme.   The title is unrelated to the theme.   The title illuminates an aspect of the theme.      16. What is the best summary of the theme of the poem?       Dead people have no place in the memory of the living.   The dead are more imaginative than the living.   The dead live on in history.   The dead are best forgotten.      17. What kind of rhyme did Haniel Long use in this poem?       exact   slant   internal   blank verse      18. What is the most reasonable interpretation of the meaning of this line from the poem?

20090203144802AAe2VBB	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Novel HELP - please help review this!!!?	I'm 15 and am 25000 words into my novel, Andradar, please review my plan and let me know what you honestly think because i am having second thoughts on some of the twists and turns in the plot!!! By the way, my writing is much much better than that of the plan.      Detailed Andradaen Synopsis   Background: Andradar is a floating dimension, which uses the same setting as Earth; this is a purely coincidental product of a clash in space time. As Andradar is in the 5th dimension, we as humans in the 4th dimension cannot sense it. In the 5th dimension, one is able to travel into their memories and relive their past. The book is set in the future, train stations are trashed and no longer used, there has been a Great War which has affected all dimensions, due to conflict within religion, causing Andradar to be split by a Crack. The peace treaty in the 4th dimension was negotiated in Stone Henge, with each stone being carved into a different religious symbol. Andradar is a floating city (like an island); if you fall off the edge you are hurled into space. Andradar is ruled by a monarchy, traditionally referred to as the Master, who dresses in robes and wears a mask, in order to distinguish the current Master from the previous and future Masters, the colour of the mask alternates between black and white The Master’s eyes are golden and royalty’s eyes turn golden between dusk and dawn.  Andradar is the city of Angels, instead of becoming a teenager and adult, children in Andradar become Angels, this refers to their more mature state of mind as well as the emergence of their wings and their ability to fly. The children of society live on one side of the Crack, on the eve of their thirteenth birthday they are required to step off their balconies, once both feet leave the ground, their wings emerge. Not all children of Andradar are able to turn Angel, these select few are considered as scum and referred to as ‘lates’. The public is not aware that some ‘lates’ can read minds. There is a sense of religion in Andradar; there is belief in Alzaan, which is viewed not as an ultimate personality, but an all governing force similar to nature. The sculpture of Alzaan has been present in the city (Zodiac Square) since the beginning of time and is supposedly a gift from Alzaan to the city, anyone who touches the sculpture is instantly happy. The Great War in Andradar was between good and evil, and the power of all good (Alzaan) was destroyed. Only the prophecy is able to restore this power, the power has been drained from the sculpture and now only the prophecy can touch the sculpture, others feel a magnetic force repel them. In order to find the prophecy, the Master (Nathan) introduces the Intelligence Examination, which filters out the extremely able children they are then tested physically, mentally and psychologically. So far the prophecy has not been found, the children who pass the Intelligence Examination, return to the children’s side of the Crack after the tests, they become Carers at the orphanage and hometels (which provided children with a comfortable hotel like service for a small fee from the parents).  The Angelites are the Emergency Service.   Story:  When Jack, the Master’s eldest son proposes to Rhea, a ‘late’, he is disowned by his family, for bringing shame. Jimmy, Jack’s best friend and the son of the Royal gardener Tom witnesses this. The Master dies leaving Nathan, Jack’s brother in charge, however before his death, the Master commands Nathan to make the unbreakable vow of destroying his brother’s family. In order to assist him in doing so, he passes two laws: newborns were to be chipped preventing them from travelling into their memories and allowing the Master’s departments of ‘lates’ to read their minds, alter and block memories. Cidus, the drug of optimism was to be administered to all citizens on the night they turn Angel, in order to prevent complaints about the lack of free will. Hyprins, hypnotised robotic bird like creatures are also introduced, programmed to keep watch over all citizens of Andradar that are chipped.    Before Jack leaves he says farewell to Jimmy whose wife Maria is due to have a baby. Jimmy says he wanted Jack to be the Godfather, Jack says of course he will be and that he will miss Jimmy.    Jack and Rhea, banished from Andradar wonder around the outskirts of the city, teetering on the edge of space. They meet Spag a lone traveller who claims he knows of land outside/under Andradar, a deserted but beautiful ravine occupied by a couple, Ash and xxx. They fly there, Jack carrying Rhea. The three of them live there on the Horizon. Spag retains contact with the outside world and delivers Jack’s letters to Jimmy and other friends. Spag also keeps Jack and Rhea updated on current affairs and when the chipping is introduced they all develop and strengthen their mental security. Maria dies in childbirth and Jimmy name his son Carlos. Jack and Rhea have a daughter, they call her Kisha. Jack th

Helen, thy beauty is to me A       Like those Nicean barks of yore, B   That gently, o'er a perfum'd sea, A       The weary way-worn wanderer bore B       To his own native shore. B         On desperate seas long wont to roam, C       Thy hyacinth hair, thy classic face, D   Thy Naiad airs have brought me home C       To the beauty of fair Greece, D   And the grandeur of old Rome. C         Lo ! in that little window-niche E       How statue-like I see thee stand! F       The folded scroll within thy hand — F   A Psyche from the regions which E       Are Holy land ! F      *This poem was wrote by Edgar Allen Poe.*

20090203145627AA1fALH	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	A few questions about Maximum Ride?	I recently became interested in the Maximum Ride series. I'm currently about half way through the fourth book, and I am very disappointed.       I have a few questions about this book, and the future of the series.      1. Why is James Patterson devoting a book of a great series to Global Warming? Its just the most idiotic thing I could possibly think of to continue the series. To me, it just seems that he's trying to push his political viewpoint on to his readers.      2. Are the future Maxmimum Ride books going to be about all this stupid "saving the planet captain green" stuff? Because if it is, I'm out.       3. WHY exactly is James Patterson creating books about mankind's destruction of the world?      I started reading these books because they were entertaining, creative, and provided a thrilling storyline, not because I want to read about how the Planet's in danger from carbon dioxide produced by mankind. When James Patterson wrote that people where going to destroy the Planet, I thought he was referring to a nuclear war breaking out. Frankly, I don't believe that "Global Warming" is real. I've done enough research to back my theory up. Please don't attack me for this, this question isn't to debate global warming. I read a synopsis for the fifth book, being released this April, and it seems that it's going to be about rescuing fish from extinction. If this is the way this storyline is going to continue, I'd prefer not to read any more of it.       Please give me a link to some interview or something with James Patterson, confirming that this storyline isn't going to go all "Captain Green" on me, because frankly, thats just pathetic.

I have a little portrait studio and I did a photo session today with a family that drove a long distance for their session. I have been ill and therefor not as focused as I should have been and somehow my camera setting got knocked in to AV while taking their portraits so almost all of their shots are in AV. I can lighten them with no issues as I have photoshop but the file is filled with noise and has speckles that make it look grainy. Is there anything I can do to minimize this problem or make it less grainy? I am good at photoshop but not great so I thought I'd see if anyone had any ideas on here. It's a free session so they aren't out anything but they drove to far for me to have them come back out again. Any help is appreciated. Thanks in advance!
