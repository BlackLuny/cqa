20090308092552AAaIyOq	Entertainment & Music;Television;Other - Television	How much dancer creativity in Randy Jackson's "America's Best Dance Crew" is professionally generated/paid for?	I do like this show so I'm not criticizing.  But there are some curious things about the creative production on stage which to me appear to be funded and assisted by professionals and/or Randy Jackson's budget.  That is, these are supposed to be average kids and young adults from sometimes, the streets who may not be so wealthy.  Yet when they get on stage, they have some pretty fancy costumes sometimes, all coordinated and even custom made or altered.        And I'm not questioning the ability of these dancers to generate their own costumes.  But EACH WEEK they have different ones, and sometimes more than one in a single show performance.  That's a lot of work, time, and sewing for dancers who are supposed to be focusing on creating choreography in a tight production schedule.      So I'm wondering if Randy Jackson, et. al., is not putting in his own costume designers and reseources to work to help out with the dancers' look on stage  And indeed, costuming can really add to the appeal of any dance group.      But the groups are all supposed to be independent and in competition with each other. So production financing and costuming as well as the ability to fly across the nation to appear in the show (in Los Angeles, I believe) would appear to be key elements to success with any group, but I sense Randy Jackson has generously assisted each group with financing for these things to raise the overall production values of the show.      This is something I don't really mind but if indeed any of the groups are getting professional CHOREOGRAPHY assistance, that would seem to interfere with the spirit of the competition.  In the season finale last night, six of nine starting dance crews were consolidated into two groups of three to do group performances, paired on dancing style.  The level of coordination was so fantastic, I sensed they had outside help to bring these groups together to create those performances, although they borrowed from the original moves created by each crew.      On balance, though, are the dancers really HIRED PERFORMERS for Randy Jackson and his show if indeed all this financial, costuming, and perhaps even choreography assistance is being given them?  The purse for the winning dance crew wasn't much at $100,000, but I'm sensing the show spent FAR MORE if indeed they were financing air travel, hotel, costuming, perhaps food and perhaps even choreographic direction.      I'm just asking if the audience is seeing things in the stage performance which are not all the unique creation or independent funding from each dance crew.  It's a great show, but I'm seeing some professional help that may not be fully disclosed to the audience.  What do you think?

There was once a stockbroker who had made a ton of money off the stock market and decided to retire to a ranch in Montana. One day he was out in his front yard planting some flowers when he sees dirt flying up behind a truck. The truck pulls into his driveway and a famer gets out of his truck.    "Hi, my name is Bob. I'm your neighbor. I live about five miles away and I came to invite you to a party I am having tonight."    "What kind of a party is it?" asks the stockbroker.    "Oh, we're going to do a little dancing, a little fighting, a little eating, little drinking, and a little screwing."    "That sounds great,' said the stockbroker. "What should I wear?"    "I don't care," said Bob. "It's just gonna be the two of us."

So I was watching Just For Laughs a couple of weeks ago and there was this one comedian who was talking about running into people and the street. He said something like, "I get really paranoid when I'm walking and there's someone coming towards me. I feel like they're going to kill me or something. But I don't want to seem rude going to the other side of the street, so I just keep running towards them. I'm thinking, I shouldn't be rude, I should die!" He went on to talk about watching scary movies when he's alone and how he wraps himself in the blanket because he figures when a killer comes for him it will "slow the stabbing!" Then he talks about going to the bathroom and how he always feels like there's someone behind the shower curtain. He said, "I picture having my pants halfway down and some guy comes out with a knife and starts stabbing me. 86, 87, 88, I don't know how high this guy can count!" And then he talks about how you shouldn't open the shower curtain too slowly or too fast, and, "Maybe if I open it fast enough, I'll scare him, and he'll slip and stab himself."

No one could understand, my life was total hell   Trapped in a dark pit, that was called my cell   Help was futile, no chance to ever escape   Taken by all my fears, blinded by the tape   The demons they surrounded me day and night   Nowhere to go,nothing to do, no way to fight   Hearing screams in the night, scared out of my mind   As I pray that I'm someone that they can find   Then one day the demons started to scream and yell   It was and angel sent, some how I could tell   She open my eyes and I could see the light   I looked at her and knew everything was alright      I'm gonna get that girl with flaming red hair   Show her my love, show her I can care   Gonna get that girl, gonna make her mine   Its irrelevant, only gonna take some time      When I saw her the demons would disappear   Finally I understood, and it was all clear   The were afraid for once, she was like lead   Change how I thought with every word that she said   She was an angel sent to me from high above   Sent here to show me the world and true love   And with her the evil would stray away   I knew she was the one to save my day   Her flaming hair cut every bad thing into half   Her smile and what she did just made laugh   So I took a chance and asked her to be mine   And ever since then, all has been fine      I got that girl flaming red hair   Showed her I can love, show I can care   I got that girl, and I made her mine   It was irrelevant, it only took some time      Now me and the angel are holding hands   No hatred, no lies, and not one demand   Life has gone from hell to heaven in a flash   Nothing bad happens, and if it does it turns to ash   Her wings protect me from all the hate   She keep me in line, but it was way too late   For some reason God gave her, then took her away   Some damn drunk hit her and my world turned all grey   Life went from heaven to hell in less than a week   Now I'm some painted up, crazy, just your normal freak   But now my angel is flying with her white wings   Knowing she's thinking about me, as she sings   Now the only see her again is to get to those gates   So I grip my axe and pray it's not to late      I had the girl with flaming red hair   Showed her my love, showed her my care   I had the girl and I made her mine   I'll see her again, only gonna take some time      The Midwest Arsonist

He then begins to fondle her breasts. "Do you know what I`m doing now", he says.   "Yes," says the woman, "you`re checking for any lumps or breast cancer."       "That`s right," replies the doctor. He then gradually proceeds to having sexual intercourse with her. "Do you know," he pants "what I`m doing now?"       "Yes," she says. "You`re getting gonorrhea."

20090308102053AAsgMlu	Entertainment & Music;Television;Soap Operas	Y&R - who else can't stand Abbie?	It's the whole package... her attitude sucks.  I hate the fact that she is a spoiled rotten little rich brat.  Her acting ability leaves a lot to be desired - I don't think she has delivered a single line yet that I've felt like it was honest and sincere and from the heart - maybe she's trying to hard?  I'm not sure I just don't like the actress.  And then the whole Noah and Eden thing.  She gets all high and mighty about Eden being at the birthday party and basically accused her of killing her father.  I think she's pointing fingers in the wrong direction.  I think she should be blaming herself.  She was part of the group that sent Eden out for that "skating party" - and she knew that Noah and Eden were an item - so why wouldn't she invite her boyfriend to a party.  She's got this magnificent horse and the thrill seems to have worn off now since Noah got a car for his 16th.  Why in the world would I want a trillion dollar horse when daddy can buy me a Lamborghini?  I just cannot stand that girl.

20090306193214AAkv32l	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	What do you think of my story?	Read it. Critique it. Make suggestions. It would be nice if you read the whole thing (It's only about three pages). It is just a short "Folk Tale" that I wrote. Any suggestions are welcomed.   :–D      Thank You For Your Time    It was a long, long time ago, before our grandfathers' grandfathers, when it was sunny all day long. The sun never went down, and always shone its light on the earth. Flowers and trees prospered under the sun, absorbing its nutritious rays of light. The men of the world had all the time on their hands, and could always finish their job right for they had light to work by. There was no way to measure time, for the sun did not set nor move across the earth, and so everything went at its own pace: slow and content, in no rush to finish before dark. Because night never came, there was no need for man to shut his eyes to the dark, evil world of the night and pass the hours in sleep; everyone and every thing was awake for all time. The world was tired from being awake all the time, but they dared not to give up the sight of their light for sleep.       There was a man in a village, by the name of Neaht, who, unlike the other men who worshiped the sun, despised the sun. He was always tired and irritable. What did the sun do for him but dry up his land? He was too tired to water it enough to keep up with the sun's constant rays. He wanted to do something that no man, up until that time, had done before: sleep. Sleep would solve everything for him; he would be able to rest and wake up fresh and happy, ready to battle the sun on his crops. There was but one thing stopping him, and that was, of course, the sun. How could one sleep with so much light?       One day Neaht decided to tell his wife, Mensis, about his plans to sleep and how he would benefit it. Although, when Mensis heard his plan she could not understand how one could simply shut their eyes to the brilliant sun.     "Why would you want to shut your eyes on such beautiful light? The light of our God, the sun?" Mensis questioned Neaht.     "I do not wish to insult our God, but my mortal body demands rest. How do you not feel tired?" Neaht questioned. "The sun must go so I can sleep!"    Mensis responded thoughtfully, "We all feel tired, but surely life without the sun is worse."    And so Neaht stomped off feeling grumpy to talk with the other men of the village, all the time mumbling, "Silly woman doesn't know what she is talking about."       Neaht found the other men of his village in a circle at the village meeting square, for they had all finished their current chores. Neaht approached the tired men, who sat mumbling to themselves about how they lacked the energy for a hunt that night. Neaht greeted them and, sitting down, began to share his idea. The other exhausted men of the village readily agreed that getting rid of the sun for some time and sleeping would be for the benefit of the world. With this, they set about making plans on how to make the sun stop shinning without insulting their God.       The village men plotted on how to take the sun out of the sky, and come to the conclusion that it was best that one of their own went up to plead with the sun to go away for a while. All the village men agreed that, because it was his idea, that Neaht should go speak with the sun god himself. A group of men captured a large eagle for which Neaht could fly upon to rise up and speak with the Lord Sun. As Neaht mounted the great eagle and took off, the village waved him good bye and good luck. There was one person missing, though, from Neaht's farewell ceremony: Mensis.        Neaht flew on his great eagle for what seemed forever, ever facing towards the sun. His skin began to burn as he drew close, the feathers on the eagle singeing, and Neaht's eyes watering from the bright light. The Great Sun God saw Neaht draw near.     "Who dares to approach me? State who you are and why you have come or I will burn you to a crisp."    Neaht, hovering on his grand eagle, trembled. "It is I, the Great Neaht of the village of the Steorras. I have come as a representative as my village and the world of the man to beg of you, oh Great Flame, to extinguish your light so we may rest."    The sun was flabbergasted. "Extinguish my light?!? How dare you insult my importance in your lives. Without me, you would shrivel and die. Although – if my people wish it, I shall do as my people ask, but keep in mind that the consequences are ones you will have brought upon your selves."     And with that, the sun disappeared and all went black. Neaht could not see a thing in the sky, above or below. Excited, he urgently flew his grand eagle back to his village, only finding his way through memory.        When Neaht returned to his village, everyone was already in their huts fast asleep. Neaht stumbled over to his hut in the dark, stumping his toes and running into trees; the night was darker than the coal left over in the fire pits used for cooking. As Neaht reached his hut, his wife gree

All the girls at my school are soooo hot; even though I have a girlfriend, I would probably betray her in an instant if I had the opportunity. Really, they're all so sexy, it's like, if I wanted to seek a life of sexual moderation, I couldn't have picked a worse place to go to. I don't want to be like this, but what can I do? I'm a slave to my body.

Every commercial on television has a web site at the   bottom of the screen.       8. Leaving the house without your cell phone, which you   didn't have the first 20 or 30 (or 60) years of your   life, is now a cause for panic and you turn around to go and get it.       10.

The doctor gave   the man a jar and said, "Take this jar home and bring   back a semen sample tomorrow."       The next day the 85-year-old man reappeared at the   doctor's office and gave him the jar, which was as clean   and empty as on the previous day. The doctor asked what   happened and the man explained: "Well, doc, it's   like this - first I tried with my right hand, but nothing.   Then I tried with my left hand, but still nothing. Then I   asked my wife for help. She tried with her right hand, then   with her left, still nothing. She tried with her mouth,   first with the teeth in, then with her teeth out, still   nothing. We even called up Arlene , the lady next door and   she tried too, first with both hands, then an armpit, and   she even tried squeezing it between her knees, but still   nothing.

The lady said I needed lots of their products, because I had a mixed skin type. My mom spent $70+ on this whole kit, and the products aren't working. That's a LOT of money, and I feel like it went wasted. When my skin breaks out, she gets mad because she wants me to use the product. She doesn't get that it just doesn't work for me! It makes my skin worse!       I was looking around to find a new products online, (Clean and Clear, Neutrogena), and I found acne.org.      One there, they sell products. They are completely safe, and harmless. The videos and success stories seem pretty convincing. It isn't celebrity endorsed, just to make you buy it, like ProActive was.      I really want to try it, a lot. But I don't think my mom will approve. Here's why      1) Money's tight, but I would pay for it. It's $34.   2) She most likely will think it's unsafe.   3) She will make me use ProActiv (which makes my acne worse)   4) She spent a lot of money on ProActiv      How can I convince her otherwise?    http://www.acne.org/

20090306200953AATNODf	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	When you're crying or feeling really down, what do you want others who are around to do?	When people are sad I always wonder what they would want me to do for them, and when I'm sad people tend to do things that just make things worse.  So what do you prefer?       Personally I'm #3      1. Try to cheer you up, even if it doesn't solve anything, things seem a lot better if you can laugh about something      2. Talk to you, it helps to have someone who understands and would listen to your thoughts      3. Leave you alone, you don't want people to see you like this and you get over it faster on your own      4. Tell you to stop crying.  Sometimes you need some tough love to get you to snap out of your emo-ness.

20090306221202AAqUFgQ	Entertainment & Music;Horoscopes	Gemini men...how do I get on with you and therefore have a successful relationship with you?	My last relationship with a Gemini man was a disaster due to the "proverbial duality" of this sign. He'd reel me in with what I needed then when I got closer to him, cast me out cruelly and often unexpectadly. A lot of other women I know who had relationships with Gemini men described similar experiences with this elusive sign. Yet others have told me their Gemini men were great! Perhaps it has to do with our atrological compatibility? I am a Taurean. I am so attracted to the eclictic, intellectual nature of Gemini, but in a relationship I need to feel secure and needed. Gemini men let me know how to handle you as I've met another who i'm holding at bay due to painful memories of my experience with my former Gemini (birthdate 10/6/68).

20090306225958AAN1Vs7	Entertainment & Music;Comics & Animation	Would I be considered a fujyoshi?	Okay, so I am somewhat of an otaku. Yes, I know that in japan being called "otaku" is an insult. Like being called a nerd or geek. But putting that word into the context that I am from the U.S.,  i love manga, anime, foreign shows, collecting anime/ manga magzines and posterz and everything involved with the subculture. So I am pretty sure that I am at least an American version of otaku, but Am i fujyoshi?      >>>>>Fujyoshi (腐女子 ?, lit. "rotten girl") is a pejorative Japanese term for female fans of manga and novels that feature romantic relationships between men, often with the implication of Yaoi concept. It is also a homophonous pun on fujoshi (婦女子 ?), a term for respectable women. The name originated with members of the demographic, who self-deprecatingly refer to their way of thinking, which perceives homosexual relationships between male characters in stories that do not include homosexual themes, as being "rotten". "Fujoshi" carries a connotation of being a "fallen woman".[1]            >>>>> I like shonen ai, but i tend to stay away from any yaoi (the hardcore stuff), for me it's a tad creepy to say the least, but the cute puppy love stuff, I enjoy. So would I be considered fujyoshi? Are any of you fujyoshi?   and i'm pretty sure a good amount of my friends are XD

20090306170409AAluoau	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	I want to go to public school, I'm homeschooled and I have reasons. Help?	I want to go to public school, I'm homeschooled and I have reasons. Help?   Okay. I'm homeschooled. I'm in 6th grade. Next year I will be in 7th. I want to go to public school. More than ANYTHING.    Why: Because I have a bunch of friends that go and I'd get to be with them and I'd have a locker to design and I'd get excersize and just the whole experience of getting to go to school and having a personality and being with friends and just having fun. AND the discipline will help me out, too.      Why do I think I should be allowed: because every other kid in my family got to go to school (I have 5 siblings, by the way) and I think I should be allowed, too and also there is a woman that teaches there and she is a Christian at our church and is friends with my mom so yeah. Also, I'll lose weight and I need to because I'm overweight. Sometimes they have to run a mile. I'll definitely lose weight.      Why all of the sudden?: I've always wanted to. But I realllllly want to this year because my best friend is in 8th grade and 7 and 8th graders are in classes together so I'll see her more and this year I've been trying a lot to go. I made a petition (which I'd like you to sign) and I've made 17 reasons why I should go and more.      Why do my parents say no?: Because we are Christians and they say I'll learn bad things and I don't need to and they want to know what I'm learning and yeah...      I want to go more than anything in the world. I just want to. If you think I should, please sign my petition.    http://www.PetitionOnline.com/schoolgo/p...       I know school isn't just great, I know there is a bunch of bad stuff, but I'm willing. I'm willing to get made fun of and to have a lot more work and to get up early and to do all that walking and running and everything. It is worth it for me. I want this so much. All I'm asking, is for you to please sign my petition. Please. If I could, I'd give you a cookie. :]      BTW I've never been to school.   The reason this is in this category is to get a lot of people. You do not need to be a school expert to help. Just to let you know, that is why. :)      Oh and I already asked this question, but I need as many answers as possible.

20090306201114AAVBpmF	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	What do you think of this????	I have recently discovered that my gf of 3 years has been cheating on me for the last 3 or 4 months with someone she works with. I found this out through a mutual friend who showed me a picture of this. Her sister (Kim), whom I have know for 5 years and even was the one who set us up, came over to talk to me about it. Kim talked to me about it for a few hours and told me how sorry she was for her sisters behavior and I didn't deserve to be treated like this. After a few hours of talking and feeling better after our talk, which we use to have a lot of long ones before dating her sister, she leaned over and kissed me. I didn't pull away nor did it go any further than kissing and holding each other. She than whispered in my year how she has always been in love with me but never wanted to destroy our friendship. I didn't say it, but I have always felt the same but cherished our friendship too much to pursue her. Problem, I feel guilty for kissing her and feeling these things because I am with her sister and feel I should try to correct things with my gf. What should I do? Opinions please.

Broken Shards of Jade      Attempts to try and fill the void before you came around…were all in vain!   Beaten down but I stand before you now….free of my chains…   I took on the highest peak, when I was told I was too weak,   Let me fall into you love, you don’t have to speak.       I see…………………….things so clearly now   I face…………………….the world so fearlessly now (pause and then music resumes loudly)      Your hands on my…skin   Breathless whispers, sinking in   Staring up at black that goes on in an infinite race   Wind is searching through the trees   I wish that all of time would freeze   A moment of pure ecstasy, clutched in time’s embrace      Two broken shards of jade   Are lost and can’t be saved   And they’re happier that way   And here their ghosts will stay…      What we are is only what we know   And what I know is only that I’m so,   Lost without a track.   I gotta get you back.   Who we are is what we show    And what I show is that I’d go   To any heights to get make you know   I’m missing what I lack.

In the night one man wakes up and decides to take his share.   While dividing the banana, he decided he will not give monkey's share to him    and will divide the bananas among men only.      After dividing, he finds that apart from 12 equal piles, he is left with one extra banana.   So he tries to give the extra banana to the monkey.   However when he tries to give it, the monkey kills him.       Later 2nd man wakes up hungry    and decides to take his share.   On the way to the bananas,   he finds the body of the 1st man,    which pleases him because he will now be entitled to 1/11 of the total banana.   After dividing them up into 11 piles(not giving monkey his share) he is again left with one banana       and he also tries to give the monkey that extra banana.    The monkey kills him too.   And 1 by 1 everyone goes through the same process, until the 12th man wakes up gets all bananas."      how many minimum number of bananas i must have to start with?

20090306215846AAtowPQ	Entertainment & Music;Music;Classical	Musical notation question.?	Hello. I have a problem concerning when a note is added right before another note (they both have the same duration ), but its tail is facing the opposite direction. Does that mean i should play it with the notes on its right? Play it with the other hand?   I uploaded a picture from Clair de Lune to explain what I mean. The note in question is in bar 11 ( the first one from the right ). As you can see, the second note looks out of place.    http://img4.imageshack.us/img4/2849/exam... 
20090306220739AAUOpHD	Entertainment & Music;Movies	Where can I watch Zero No Tsukaima full free online episodes?	I really like the anime and I find it hard to watch it cuz some of the sites I go to are blocked at my school (i'm boarding). I tried some pr?x?es, but the school blocked those, too. I can't even type in the word or else the whole thing will be blocked. And most of those pr?x?es don't allow video watching. I found the series on mysp***, but since that's blocked I can't watch it there. And I can't find season 1 on veoh either.      So does anyone know where I watch Zero No Tsukaima seasons 1-3 online, Japanese dub with English subs? I don't want to watch it on megavideo cuz I don't want to be limited to how much time I can watch something.

He told me if I wanted to do something I should play the Guitar. Honesty I don't mind which instrument I chose, my dad said he would support either one. But now I am wondering do people find the Piano a girl instrument? Which is harder to play? Keep in mind I am a complete newbie! Which would you think is a better instrument for a male a Piano or Guitar? Thanks you, I do chose best answers!

20090227091324AASdJmf	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	What do you think of this "joke" that teachers in my school played on us?	So they told us that as of May 2009 the education system in scotland will change.   And the changes were that we would have to be at school at 8 in the morning, we would have 1 hour of "keep fit" and then 1 hour of Protestant Service.   anyone who was not a protestant would have red books instead of green ones. They would no longer teach any modern language apart from English, they would no longer teach History but instead they would teach "Britain's Heritage"   also the boys would do agricultural work and the girls would do child care and hairdressing.   The best one: they would measure our noses and if it was more than 5cm for girls and more than 5.5 cm for boys they would inject us with a vitamin or something.   This is exaclty what the Nazis did!!   Being an immigrant in this country I was really worried. I was ready to go and book a flight and get the hell out of Britain!   what do you think of this??

Se você costuma pular a refei??o pensando em emagrecer , saiba que a estratégia n?o funciona e só prejudica seu organismo. Segundo a Dra° Ellen Simone Paiva, endocrinologista do Centro Integrado de Terapia Nutricional, quem deixa de jantar por que acha que a noite n?o queima energia , está enganado. A refei??o noturna deve ser responsável por 25% das calorias ingeridas no dia. Para a médica. o hábito de jantar, principalmente em casa, tráz muitos benefícios á saúde.   =é melhor sentar e jantar tranquilamente do que ficar com fome e beliscar a noite toda.   =a refei??o pode ser mais demorada, feita `a mesa , junto dos familiares   =permite op??es mais saudáveis na hora de preparar os alimentos(como grelhar ao invés de fritar)   =uma refei??o leve garante um sono melhor.

20090307003943AAXGh9I	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rock and Pop	(WARNING:ITS LONG) Will someone give me an opinion on my essay about rock music?!?	Rock Music. What do you think of when you hear those words? Do you think of Jimi Hendrix’s guitar riffs, or The Who’s Keith Moon and his drum solos, maybe The Doors Jim Morrison and his undeniable stage presence? Or do you think of the horrible mainstream modern bands of today ,or that music is no longer taken as an art form but as a business, and how media distorts musical tastes. I believe that the supposed ‘death of rock’ in the 2000’s need to be resurrected with quality rock artists becoming popular again.    Many people I talk with would agree- they would much prefer to listen to older rock bands than todays’ lineup. Most popular modern rock bands formed within the 2000’s are horrible. I think the one main problem with it is the bands are too commercial. there are really only two types of “rock” that you really hear today; If you look at Wikipedia, pop rock in the definition it states many believe is a “commercial product” and “not a sincere form of music”. Also, Wikipedia states the emo type as becoming “mainstream”. If you turn on any musical television station you will at least hear one song from both. According to the Billboard Top 100, some of these artists are Fall Out Boy, The Academy Is….,Panic! At the disco, Boys Like Girls, Metro Station, Kelly Clarkson, and The Jonas Brothers (Honestly, you can’t get anymore commercial than the over-exposed Jonas Brothers who shouldn’t even be considered in the genre.). Rock Music used to be about not conforming and rebelling- not the opposite as it is today. Another problem with the modern rock genre is that  the songs are all too familiar. For this essay I thought I was being a bit too rough on the modern music genre, so I go to the billboard top 100 and look up the songs on youtube, after I was down listening to the popular songs I found that many of them were presumed undistinguishable from the others. Many had familiar tunes and vocal styles. My last problem with modern rock music is too distorted, mainly using electronic equipment such as a vocal effect processor. According to James Meeker, who wrote an article called ‘Improving your industrial vocals’ on a community for musicians called DarkSonus.com; He made a very good point, he states: “I'm getting a little tired of endless numbers of industrial artists running their vocals through distortion in order to sound "aggressive." Not only is this trend becoming tiresome, it ruins the dynamic range and depth of your vocal line.” and he also makes a point about people generally liking the human vocal range. This is generally an annoying habit that is overdone by bands particularly from the modern emo and metal/hard rock bands.    My next reason why we need quality rock artists to become popular again is because modern rock today is not taken as an art form but its thought of as a business.  Music is supposed to be an art form, a form of expression with even the most random of emotion. In the past, when you heard rock music you knew there was emotion behind it- just listen to Janis Joplin or Hendrix. Now in days it seems songs are limited to two emotions- love and hate. There is no meaning behind it or complexity and creativity, you can sense this when they are performing, artists like Pete Townshend of The Who captured whatever emotion the song was about and expressed it freely- you don’t really see that anymore, artists aren’t  feeling their music.  I think a quote from the movie Almost Famous says how it was the best: “some people have a hard time explaining rock 'n' roll. I don't think anyone can really explain rock 'n' roll. Except Pete Townshend, but that's okay. Rock 'n' roll is a lifestyle and a way of thinking... and it's not about money and popularity.”; Now it is mainly about money and popularity, Bands are even asking for extremely large sums to just play some venues. I think we need more bands in the public eye that are just in it for the music and expression.     Lastly, I think we need more quality rock artists around because the media distorts the masses musical tastes. Lets Face it, the media has a major influence over us; Would people care more about world issues  and less about celebrities if magazines didn’t try to dramatize their ‘glamorous’ lives. The media controls basically all trends, including music. Mostly all media(Except really Rolling Stone) picks some mediocre band and over-exposes them until every just had to have them on their play lists. The media basically can generate a lot of hype over a band , and maybe if they can get hold of maybe a more underground or lesser known quality rock band it would generate a following. Now, I am one of the many rock advocates constantly looking for newer material and bands to listen to. I must admit its pretty hard when it comes to newer rock music- you have to look for it sometimes due to lack of media coverage. I’m not as bias to modern rock is it may seem, I mean I do have some particular newer songs and bands I listen to and some are even

The interviewer decides to start with the basics.    "So, miss, can you tell us your age, please?"    The blonde counts carefully on her fingers for about 30 seconds before replying "Ehhhh ..22!".    The interviewer tries another straightforward one to break the ice.       "And can you tell us your height, please?".    The young lady stands up and produces a measuring tape from her handbag. She then traps one end under her foot and extends the tape to the top of her head. She checks the measurement and announces "Five foot two!".    This isn't looking good so the interviewer goes for the real basics. "And ehh, just to confirm for our records, your name please?"       The blonde bobs her head from side to side for about twenty seconds, mouthing something silently to herself, before replying "Mandy!".       The interviewer is completely baffled at this stage, so he asks "Just out of curiosity, miss. We can understand your counting on your fingers to work out your age, and the measuring tape for your height is obvious, but what were you doing when we asked you your name?"       "Ohh that!", replies the blonde, "That's just me running through 'Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you....' "

20090227120731AA3l892	Entertainment & Music;Comics & Animation	Pokemon Continuity Error?	Well, how come in the American version they make the Pokemon movies outside the continuity when in the original Japanese versions they're feature length episodes.      Example, Pokemon the 2nd movie Ash see's Zapdos and knows it, but in Master uest which is set waaaay after he sees Zapdos and says 'What's That?' as if he'd never seen one before. And similar things happened when Lugia and Entei made appearances in the series. In the original version they referenced the movies.      Why does 4Kids do that to Pokemon?

20070516112059AApTiJg	Entertainment & Music;Movies	Por que f?s de 007 implicam tanto com Daniel Craig, simplesmente por ser baixinho, loiro e feio? Penso que...	...Os f?s ficam t?o encucados, por ele n?o ter o perfil mais exato para o papel que, nem se preocupam em observar a atua??o dele e, às vezes, nem a qualidade do roteiro e efeitos especiais. Michelle Pfeiffer é loira mas, cadê que alguém ficou furioso por ela n?o ser morena e reclamou dela ter sido escalada para o papel de Mulher-Gato? O ator pode n?o ser muito parecido fisicamente com o papel que ele interpreta mas, a atua??o dele pode ser boa. Pensem nisso!
20070519094319AAsiAtB	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Você acredita que o "primeiro amor" é pra sempre? Deixe sua opini?o....?	Com o passar dos tempos, criou-se a idéia de que o "primeiro amor" é t?o marcante que pode acompanhar uma pessoa por toda a vida, num misto de frustra??o e busca da felicidade.    O "primeiro amor" é quase uma sombra viva do passado, um ente querido, que via de regra nos trás lembran?as e inseguran?a. Mas esta idéia de "amor idealizado" muitas vezes n?o passa mesmo de um "ideal" que colocamos, inconscientemente, num pedestal (inalcan?ável) para nos resguardar do próprio medo de frustra??o. De uma frustra??o maior.   ( AMOR DE ALMAS )
20070519203311AAxQY5o	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Mau hálito? Descubra se você tem e procure se cuidar....?	Sem escolher faixa etária, ra?a, classe social... o mau hálito, quando chega, n?o perdoa! Muita gente tem esse problema e n?o se dá conta.    Como ninguém quer isso pra si, nada melhor do que dicas para evitar esse mal.      =Coma alimentos ricos em fibras, como frutas, verduras e cereais, pois eles ajudam na limpeza mecanica e total dos dentes.    =Beba muita água: pelo menos 2 litros por dia.    =Escove muito bem os dentes e a língua. Lembre-se que escovar bem n?o significa usar a for?a. Escove sempre depois que comer e também em outros momentos que julgar necessário. Escovar os dentes só é demais se virar TOC (Transtorno Obsessivo compulsivo)!    =Use o fio dental após cada refei??o. Restos de comida se decompondo no meio dos dentes causam mau cheiro   =Fa?a bochechos com anti-sépticos bucais ou com água com uma pitada de bicarbonato de sódio.    =Estar sempre bem alimentado  ajuda, pois evita a acidez estomacal

Off into the horizon the young boys race,   heroic their efforts, danger they will face,    increasingly difficult their journey becomes,   they fight their horror as the radio hums.      A car they steal, innocence is gone,   All this in the hours before dawn.   Why set out on a quest so bold?   Because of the killings they did behold.      An impression it made on all of them,   It played in their minds again and again.   Together they agreed with no indecision,   a plan was made, without great precision.      Trouble was almost a guarantee,   But not to help was an inability.         I need to finish that but I can't think of anything else.

Last week, he's been very distant. I told him exactly how I felt, like I don't deserve this, I am very lenient and patient with him, etc. etc. He said he was sorry and that he's been really busy. Well, he had time to go to this girl's bday party... I said I just wanted to know I'm still here... a 2 minute call atleast to let me know I still exist. (He called me once in a week). But we talked about it all and it is resolved.      My friend posted pix from the party. I saw pix of him and the bday girl holding hands, letting her paint his nails (which is something he would NEVER let a girl do....), her sitting on his lap while blowing the candles, etc.      And now, I can't stop thinking about it all. I haven't heard from him in 2 days. I have a feeling he didn't listen to a damn word I said. I feel like mentioning these pictures to him.. how I don't appreciate it. Or is that too "psycho"? Help.....

20090227113136AAQN3zi	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	Are you enjoying the jokes? Here is my fifth one.?	Very interesting stuff...      Smart man + smart woman = romance   Smart man + dumb woman = affair   Dumb man + smart woman = marriage   Dumb man + dumb woman = pregnancy      OFFICE ARITHMETIC      Smart boss + smart employee = profit   Smart boss + dumb employee = production   Dumb boss + smart employee = promotion   Dumb boss + dumb employee = overtime      SHOPPING MATH      A man will pay $2 for a $1 item he needs.   A woman will pay $1 for a $2 item that she doesn't need.      GENERAL EQUATIONS & STATISTICS      A woman worries about the future until she gets a husband.   A man never worries about the future until he gets a wife.      A successful man is one who makes more money than his wife can spend.   A successful woman is one who can find such a man.      To be happy with a man, you must understand him a lot and love him a little.   To be happy with a woman, you must love her a lot and not try to understand her at all.      Married men live longer than single men, but married men are a lot more willing to die.      Any married man should forget his mistakes, there's no use in two people remembering the same thing.      Men wake up as good-looking as they went to bed.   Women somehow deteriorate during the night.      A woman marries a man expecting he will change, but he doesn't.   A man marries a woman expecting that she won't change, and she does.      A woman has the last word in any argument. Anything a man says after that is the beginning of a new argument.      There are 2 times when a man doesn't understand a woman - before marriage and after marriage.

I was the only white non draftee volunteer in my unit during Vietnam the others were all Hispanic citizenship-seakers. We were drafting to fill the ranks."Pick up a rifle, learn English and a citizen you shall be!" We did it during the Civil War, Vietnam and why not NOW? The other alternative: You want citizenship, prove (like my wife had to) that you will not become a burden to the state. (What happened to THAT rule? I had to sign a 10-year affidavit of support to get her in from Korea.) One way to ensure there are no more burdens to the state is to make each illegal get sterilized It will stop anchor babies and make them think twice about flouting our immigration laws. I can see them fleeing BACK across the border!  Already have a baby or four? Don't want to be sterilized?  Put on this uniform or go home with your family to Mexico! The US military is the biggest equal opportunity employer Even with amnesty these people will be 2nd class citzs. If they were vets that would change alot

20090227114948AAVUANF	Entertainment & Music;Music;Classical	Spanish Guitar Strings.?	I have a Tangle-wood cutout semi acoustic guitar, model number TW45-DLX. With a shadow P7 built-in volume and pitch controls.   I like to play spanish and Calypso on this. However the strings are a little taught.    I am not great at the mechanic's and guitar shops are a little hard to find these days to ask advise. Due to the internet, but hey.    I know you purists out there will say get a Spanish guitar with nylon strings, but I don't want too.   So, what gage and make should I buy to slacken the tension for this guitar using metal wound and steel, and the best make.?   I would appreciate this very much, and will have to buy off the internet.   Thanks NIck.

De acordo com o jornal O Globo, o romance de Diego e íris chegou ao fim. O relacionamento de apenas dois meses parece n?o ter resistido à vida real. Como os dois est?o muito expostos na mídia, v?o manter as aparências, por enquanto, para n?o perder nenhum contrato publicitário, afirmou o jornal.      " O namoro está exposto na mídia e íris se agregou a pessoas com as quais n?o concordo, assim como algumas op??es de carreira", disse Alem?o à Revista da TV, do jornal O Globo      Mas Diego n?o parece muito abalado. Quem acompanha as peripércias da nova celebridade, sabe que ele tem se divertido bastantes nas festas e eventos sem Siri.      A mídia soube manipular, todo mundo trocou as bolas e os anjos se revelaram dem?nios! Taí a verdadeira cara do alem?o!
