Should I just wait for 3rd Gen iPod Touch? I heard it might have a camera on it, which would be awesome, or is there even going to be a 3rd? And when would it come out?      3. Is the iPod Touch even worth the price? I see people with them, and I hear they're awesome, but are they actually worth it? And where would I get the best deal? (Only stores like BestBuy, Walmart, Target, etc. MAYBE eBay, although I know eBay would give best price, I'm not sure about quality.)      Any ideas? Thanks.

20070226082457AAQC1Wq	Consumer Electronics;Music & Music Players	Can i flag tracks so that they don't sync from WMP 11 to my MP3 player?	I've got loads of foreign language learning tracks in my Windows Media Player 11 library, which I don't want to sync to my MP3 player when I let WMP pick a random selection to fill the device.    I know I can remove them from the sync list manually, but then I have to manually pick other tracks to fill up the remaining space.  As I re-sync quite often, it's a bit of a pain.  I've checked in the properties and advanced tag editors, but there don't appear to be any 'never sync this track' type options.        If this isn't possible in WMP11, are there any music players which will do this - basically which will pick random music from your library, either to play or sync, excluding certain tracks?

Despite it happening at least two weeks ago, I just found out today that Circuit City is going to tank.  I'm a pretty big movie buff, and despite disapproving of it all along, it looks like it's going to be blu-ray or nothing soon (DVD Manufacturer Technicolor experiencing losses).      My question is (being only 21-years-old, and not having a lot of experience testing the market) when do you think would be the best time to put a real focus on this endeavor?  If I haven't made it clear yet, I think the cons out way the pros with blu-ray.  but, if i'm going to have to make the switch i want it to be a cheap one.      Any info or advice would help.  This isn't a real serious or important issue.      Also, for real "best answer" material: answer if Technicolor actually just produces DVD's or actually prints the movies to them.
