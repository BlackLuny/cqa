uttbqGB9aa	Im assuming you slept with girls around your age, so my comments are directed towards that.    First, girls at that age do feel good, BUT a girl's body is not fully developed until later. Most development after teenage years are mostly internal.    A girl can feel pleasure, but at that age their body still does not know what "feels good" and what "REALLY feels good"    Additionally, if you are just playing around a little bit and then go straight into intercourse, the girl probably won't get too turned on (wet).    Females get turned on more with emotions, we are much different then men. You must do a lot of fore playing and give her body a lot of attention before her kitty cat will respond. ;)    Additionally, most younger girls think they are in touch with what their body wants, but really, they only think that the pressure of penetration is what is supposed to be making them feel good. So, you may be having sex with her and she is moaning and doing her little screams, but she isn't that wet, and your little man may feel quite sore from that, BUT just because shes responding as if she is getting turned on, she has NO IDEA what a man can really do to satisfy her in so MANY different ways.    My suggestion - Read up on your sexual techniques, and find out what a woman's body needs. Also, pay attention to her body movements when you are trying new things out. Listen for new moaning sounds and body shivers. This is good identification that you are on your way to a job well done.  There is no shame in finding out what you can do to satisfy a girl. The only shame is when girls talk about the way you couldn't satisfy them.    Good luck :)|`|ZIq2IzOmaa	Medications can affect sexual response. So can stress, being sick, hormonal changes, or a thousand other things. It's also possible to be completely and utterly in the mood for sex and just not be wet. Vaginas are just like penises in that they sometimes have their own minds and don't always do what we want them to do.     However, since your partners are young, they may just be too nervous to get wet. Being stressed about pregnancy, feeling pressured to perform, or being afraid that sex is going to be uncomfortable will all ruin a girl's response. Even if she wants to have sex, but she's nervous her body may not cooperate.     So if we assume that you're using a reliable method of birth control AND a backup method, your girl is truly interested in sex and not stressed out about the event, but she's worried sex will hurt or be uncomfortable, then she is not going to get wet. How to fix this problem?    First make sure your partner is really excited. This means lots of kissing, petting, and other attention. If she's not purring and responsive in your hands, then she's not ready for sex yet.     So now you have her all wound up and she's still not wet. Now what do you do?     Get some water-based lubricant. Water based lube is sex's best friend. Once you've got an excited girl, the careful application of some lube will allow the two of you to have comfortable, fun sex. This will help her learn that sex is always going to be fun with you, and will make it much easier for her to relax and enjoy. When the pressure is off of her to "hurry up and get wet", you may find that her body responds better next time.     It can take time for girls to get used to having sex and enjoying it. It also takes a patient partner that makes them feel sexy and safe. Though you're probably going to have much better luck getting girls to open up and have a good time if you wait until you're both a few years older.|`|dvevk1qbaa	meds can dry you up even if you are ready    also if you have a mental block which happens a lot when you are younger , like if you are nervous...even though you think you are in the mood something in the back of your mind is not...that keeps ya dry too    its common|`|AA10907244	Dude, I was still playing with G.I.

Stop sleeping around. And how flippin young are these girls? Sheesh... My answer is that you don't know what you're doing.|`|xMbmDJIhaa	It means you cant get them to orgasm and all that screaming was fake, or that they are not ready either one.|`|PhivaI6Oaa	it just depends on the girl.  some girls get wet so easily and fast,  and others just dont.  it doesnt have anything to do with the guy or what youre doing.  foreplay could help i guess, but really  its not you, its them and the girls own body and how it works  in its own way.  i hope that helped! =]|`|a5a50191dfc01b41eb49850adcd033d5aa	Maybe she's not in mood or she's just young to be more wet well anyway u r having sex in age of 16 and only two girls u r lame but u shuldn't do it as they dont have completed their body|`|9e1a0e459c90e3a8eb8741a8fb042e12aa	When a person has a dump of adrenalin it will cause them to have a dry mouth. The same is true for any other moist areas.   The excitement of sex will produce alot of adrenalin    Use a condom!    Chicks wont have sex with someone they are not attracted to.|`|HnTwqOAraa	sounds to me that the girl wasn't that into it, or wasn't into doing it. every time for me the girl was "wet" first. you could be rushing that part. get her in the mood first before you "dive in", it's called foreplay kid. make out, use your fingers or something. don't rush it let the girl get in the mood. don't be selfish|`|5b820805b9932bc37844045b822eddbeaa	I wouldn't say she isn't into it, she is still a little young and her body hasn't started producing secretions yet.    Give her a little time for her body to develop some more and you can also use K-Y Jelly which is very good in this case ok.    Have fun my young man and 1st and foremost be safe and practice safe sex out there ok.|`|9cpKYneZaa	First of all, why are you messing around at that age? I mean really isn't life hard enough without having criminal charges hanging over your head?    It takes a lot to turn a girl on. Just getting naked together isn't enough. You have to be really into her, and she has to be really into you.    Sex is a brain job first and foremost. The lube doesn't flow until the girl is emotionally aroused. The physical side is part of it and a big sensation to be sure. But its only part not all of the equation.    But truth be told, you are probably too young and don't know what you're doing. The girls you are seeing are apprehensive, probably too young, and probably don't know what they're doing.    Maybe you and these girls should think more about less actual physical sex and maturing emotionally first. That helps things along. Just messing around like that, willy nilly under age is dangerous and frankly will lead to you and your partners being disappointed in future relationships.    You see the problem is, if the girl sees sex as mechanical and unfulfilling, then that may set the tone for the rest of her life. She may see sex as boring, or totally wasteful or simply pleasing to the man.    You, on the other hand, will always assume that girls will not be turned on by you, pretty much forever, overlooking the fact that like I said, sex is an emotional exercise as well as a physical one.    The attention you spend on a girl's emotions, what she's feeling, and treating her entire body with a great deal of care and not just one organ, will set the mood and tone forever.    A lot of soft and gentle hand motions and paying attention to the rest of her, means you are into her and her emotional arousal will follow.|`|0256768370823943bbd15e024f80932daa	what do you mean they were too young!!! wtf are u like a sleeping with 10yr old!!!  for a 16yr old one or more IS many!!|`|RbPEwvTaaa	I think the age of the girl has a lot to do with it, as well as the skill of the guy. Speaking for myself, i really didn't understand what REAL sexual pleasure was until I was in my 30s.  Before that i was mostly just going through the motions.  It takes a very mature man with a lot of patience and tenderness to turn me on.  Just seeing a picture of a guy's dick on his profile, or jumping right into intercourse frankly does nothing for me.  And I suspect a lot of other women out there feel the same way i do.    It has to feel right.  She has to feel loved and wanted...VERY much so.  Your actions mean more than words.  Taking a lot of time and not rushing into anything helps. Fortunately I have found the right man and I get wet and aroused just seeing him walk into a room !!!!!  It took years to create that kind of response, however.   But i hate to say that even with the right efforts, most younger girls under age 25 or so still will not be able to completely appreciate the nuances of intimacy until they reach their "prime"....which is usually in their mid-30s.|`|49cd07e243bf1a36eb0e0431031d11d6aa	lol it sounds like u didnt turn them on ...|`|bkpBpkKGaa	no not always, even when girls aren't in the mood they can become wet. as you cant *** for hours, girls cant always stay wet. but usually if you add some lubrication (spit, actual lube) and get going, she should wet up a bit|`|jn8mBS0qaa	it just means shes dry or not absoulty horny happens to me all the time dont worry about it.:)|`|FfpXUFPxaa	definatly not, you can be in the mood no matter what... being wet just means that you are at an elevated aroused state, one usually gets wet through fingering, oral sex etc. if they are not wet this doesnt mean they are not into you at all.. it just means that they need a little bit of extra attention ;)|`|a0f80a327fcf6b505541bf1ca4e04140aa	it really depends on the girl. just cuz shes not wet doesnt always mean shes not in the mood  but if your really worried about it, work out more, work on your hygiene, work on your moves n try some foreplay|`|lDJXsJSwaa	Im 18, plenty of expierience.    Google this. From what I know, being "wet" is like us getting an erection. It simply means that they are ready and sexually appealed.|`|yFkhvTiQaa	it just means there not really that excited|`|ZIU0nI3faa	Each person has a different horny level, and a different way of being horny. Some people horniness is more of a mental thing, for others physical. It does not mean they are not in the mood, just every one is different. I hope this answers your question.|`|CyIxcsz0aa	There are SOOOO many reasons for a girl to "not get wet".     First of all, remember that wetness is a biological response to a stimuli (your dick, fingers, tongue, w/e). Some rape victims will go through orgasm during a rape! Why? Because is BIOLOGICAL!    That' said, Medications can cause dryness like it's the sahara! Effexor and other anti-depressant medications are becoming prescribed all the time and they can have terrible effects! (Some birth controls may cause this as well as many other medications!)    Also, girls have different amounts of "wetness" and orgasm. If you and a girl decide to sleep together, lube is helpful. As is salivia ( I know it might sound gross but licking your fingers and feeling her up or having her blow you does wonders with making a girl find the sex a smooth ride)    If she's not ENJOYING it, that's a different story. Try to focus on her response, try something new.    TIPS: The clit (clitoris) is right up top (covered by a little hood) That sucker has as many nerve ending as the entire HEAD of a penis. Also the "G-Spot" is on the inside of the vagina wall. It doesn't exist with everyone and its over-talked about, but if you enter in and create a hook, the wall of her vagina that is on her front side should have a spot that will leave a lot of girls nice, wet, and screaming!    Good luck and always remember to wear protection!!!|`|nhfaPN0Iaa	you are selfish and they are tragically accommodating as per the mores of todays society.  lucky you.  sorry for them.|`|aQbIzyLOaa	it could mean that she is not ready, and u need to get her ready for u hun!|`|jJqx6HQlaa	probably to young OMG 16 you shouldnt have sex. you should wait until you are of legal age. omg omg omg. lol im 16 too though so.....ok|`|wtIWal7Waa	Nah not all girls are dripping wet when they're in the mood.|`|11e7b5ad9ba61d1a91f337642b15102eaa	Ummm at 16, she is probably not complete down there. So she may not be secreting. I have no advice for you cause 16 is too young in my opinion. But be careful and educate yourself.|`|OLXv3DEAaa	You don't know what you're doing? If they aren't wet you need to spend some more time on foreplay and get them wet before you have sex.|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	more foreplay, or lube|`|a8c453b32b44c7396a920c94200d4c4eaa	nope it don't mean she is not in the mood    interesting question though|`|SiomJ10Saa	Sometimes you can be so in the mood and you just aren't.    Period, birth control, medications, etc can all affect this    simple solution, buy some lube, a lot of them have added bonuses anyways like warming (not a fan) or yours & mine (big fan)|`|Qe9rXFm0aa	How did this end up in special education?    Okay let me break it down to you like this..I assume the girls you are sleeping with are around the same age as you? Okay well 16 yr old girls, should have NO problems with vaginal dryness.    So it sounds like you aren't getting into foreplay and making the sex intimate enough...or they just arent that into you.|`|k9SrzQQgaa	Maybe you're lacking some sexual spice. If they were too young, I'd be concerned as to why you have having sex with girls that are TOO YOUNG. >:C    Dude, you only 16, enjoy life without the genitalia action or else you won't be able to enjoy it by the time you're 40.|`|pKnd0jJwaa	try more teasing.      if that doesnt help and shes not in pain just go for it bro
tTg1XU8faa	Just solve them separately and then combine them at the end:    4p   p     and    2 + p > -5 (subtract 2 from both sides)  p > -7    So p  -7. Well, p > -7 can also be written as -7     ANSWER: -7     *If you have a compound inequality that says "or," not "and," then you cannot combine the answer into one inequality like this one. You have to keep the answer with "or" in it.

And the drunk thing, STUPID!!!  Just start a conversation. Ask about how school is going, sports or anything else.

It means that you like her enough to pursue it. then if she doesn't completely ignore you, ASK HER OUT!!! That is what kills me about you guys. Just ask her out. She would most likely say yes or no, seeing as how those are the only answers. Then that's the end of it. Tada. Sorry if that's a little to harsh, but it's how that stuff works.

174pexgPaa	you are fine! stop worrying, because you can always take night classes or if it really gets to the point where you aren't passing math, just take a summer class.  I had many friends who did that.  A couple of kids I know are taking geometry there senior year and they are getting acceptance letters to colleges.  Since you are getting A's in all your classes except algebra, spend more time doing math at night at going to study groups and asking your teacher for help.|`|PkCqIfMFaa	yeah you will get into college. just obviously math isn't your strongest subject. you will most likely like a school involving liberal arts, or a certain occupational school.  but i do recommend trying to increase your math skills for the SATs. Possibly get a tutor that can help you because there is a lot of algebra based math in the SATs. There are plenty of schools that specialize in other subjects than math. So check it out, I am sure you will find something you like. Good Luck. Join clubs, extracurricular activities, show that you are a good student.|`|kGRkjw6Qaa	You can and most likely will get into college if you keep doing what you are doing.    So math is not your thing....there are plenty of majors out there in college that don't require math.    Don't worry you will be fine.|`|AA11399777	I never claim to be an expert on college related question, but high school related ones I can handle. It sounds like you aren't especially talented when it comes to Math. This is easily remedied with a meeting with your teacher, counselor, and parent. You all need to sit down and discuss your options. If you are in Alg. 1 you should be in Alg2 before the end of your senior year. So no prob there. But you have to be willing to put forth a great deal of effort. This means staying after school to get help. Spending an extra hour on STUDYING math every night (not just doing homework but reviewing your notes, spending time with an adult or friend going over what topics you might or might not understand).    You can do this. Colleges don't especially care if you excel in Math or not if you are an art major or drama major. You just won't be ablt to be a science or math major. And you could even try for that by excelling in science and working hard at math. If you don't manage to pass Alg 1 this year TAKE SUMMER SCHOOL!!! There is no shame in taking summer school classes... in fact it's a lot easier because you will probably be in a room full of other people who did not understand the topic either and the teacher will teach to cater to your needs more than in regular classes.    You have taken the first step by admitting you have a problem. You now need to make sure that your parents and teachers are aware of this fact and your worries... because without that you won't be able to succeed.|`|drIeFsxNaa	It's okay that you're behind your friends in math.   You can definately complete algebra 2 by the time you graduate though.  Um... I think can help you with the concepts, except the only (safe) way is to post it on here. I'll try to help you any way I can, if you want it! :)

Usually the maximum number of college credits that a high school student can take is 6 per semester.
b6e8a23e8ce0872697abf94a37d4524caa	The bad news is that it is that kind of stuff is somewhat unavoidable in 8th grade, especially among girls, but you can always try to overcome it!    My suggestion to deal with it would be twofold:  One, try to subtley get closer to one of your choir mates in a setting outside of choir.  Pick someone who seems on the more friendly side.  Ideally, someone who you sit next to in a class or is in another activity with you.  Do it when they're more by themselves and not cliqued off.  When I say subtle, I mean take it slow by either just being nice to them with a sincere compliment (clothes/jewelry maybe) or by politely asking them a quick question about something about choir.  Be brief, relaxed, and don't expect them to become your friend right then and there.  If they're receptive you can follow up by asking where they got the clothes item or you can just find something else nice to say at another time.  If they're rude, find someone else.    Second, and more importantly, don't stand "in the middle of the classroom looking like you want to cry".  For your own sake and the image you present, try to not let it bother you - or at least look like it doesn't.  If you're alone, just focus on your warmups or your sheet music or something.  Remind yourself that you have other friends and this is just 8th graders being cliquey.|`|RNzrhP7Kaa	talk to the individuals while they are alone. People alone are often much nicer than they are while they are in a group. then when you feel comfortable with that person, you can start hanging out with them and one or two of their friends and then more and more and tada, you're in with the choir group. :)

Because of conditions set up at the end of WWI, Germany in particular was going under financially.  Rampant inflation had sapped the country of its productivity and the security of the common man.  This is how Adolph Hitler came into power.  Europe and the West would not ease the restrictions, nor would they help the Germans directly.  This let Hitler develop the strategy of taking the populace's fear and frustration and turning it into a super-nationalism that gave them a belief in the Third Reich.  They were looking for a super figure to save them, and he promised them victory.    So had the West helped Germany to solve its economic problems, it is unlikely that Hitler would ever have found the footing that allowed him to start WWII.|`|wyWz6LYHaa	1 means to address the problem and to sort it out as it needs to be sorted out  2 i dont really know sorry  maybe there were an in crasing number of dictators arising whch was a reason why world war 2 strted and i have no idea about the last part sorry|`|ZDR1N6Q3aa	1.

Never assume the 1st 3 letter word you find is "the" but if you several in the quote it's a great hint.

f6307c174e9a08ef07d60d621dca0666aa	Child labor has existed for as long as there has been labor. The reasons for it are pretty simple: When everyone is living in crippling poverty, everyone--even children--have to "pull their weight."    It's far easier to answer why child labor is, by and large, gone in the first and second world. The primary reason is that we, as a society, have decided that it is abhorrent to force a child to work before they have a chance to grow. The secondary reason is that we think it is more important for children to be well educated before they move into the workforce.|`|cjnBs0h6aa	your question is kinda confusing...I would say when eve sinned against God and it became a curse to have child bearing pain..|`|2aEU1lmpaa	Are you asking when did people start making children work?

What you had to understand was that the body of a letter is pretty much everything after 'dear' and before 'sincerely', but they should have been more specific. I'm pretty sure they won't turn a blind eye. However, you can always have a retake.    Your school will feed you this "I don't think you should take it again because you passed and you'll mess up the school's statistics" bull. Be sure to make it known that you don't really care lol.    I feel your pain on the whole perfect score thing though. My proctor got on the phone with his wife while we were testing. smh. I even started my critical lens on the wrong page lol...i hope i still get credit for it. And the poem depressed me lol.    But yeah, this is my take on your situation.  I hope it works out.  Good luck!      Oh and if they do feed you the statistic speech, tell them that their fear of lowered statistics is only a spring of ignorance lol.|`|iA9A1jh3aa	omg i did the same exact thing!

But you would have had to be on Financial Aid at the time. As for scholarships, it depends on each organization and their rules. I know that there are also grants out there for rehabilitation of felons.|`|8KbcQGL0aa	I see no hindrance in getting grants for school if you have paid the debt for your crime especially if you are under close scrutiny by authority. As long as you don't show any indication of returning to your former life of crime you should be eligible for assistance. As far as I know the only right that felonies remove is voting rights. I think there has even been reform concerning this issue since even the incarcerated are still subject to rules and regulations set by our elected officials.|`|3RaxVJEHaa	Each scholarship has different rules about it but some friends of mine in college told me that they have valuable information regarding scholarships from this place.

edImOGbLaa	It really depends on what your school is offering and what type of college you want to go to (I am assuming you want to go to college because you want to take AP classes), my school just offers AP and im currently taking AP calculus and AP physics and it is challenging.  But i will tell you this, if you are planning on taking AP classes, be prepared for a blitzkrieg of work, tests, and challenging material, they are not for the "average student"|`|Tt2pFEqFaa	Well, AP and IB are the same exact thing pretty much, but IB takes up a lot more of your time, and the tests are a lot more expensive. AP also is expensive. Most AP classes are not until junior or senior year. I do not know what Pure is. I'd stick with AP, but do not expect college credit, because the tests are ridiculously hard!|`|Wcb1ZCb2aa	Go for AP first my scores in core classes are a little higher than those and IB will be to fast|`|RppnD2Fuaa	those marks are average in my house. i would go pure one more year before going to AP or IB. Science is fine but try working on your math. You can try AP if you can get you math higher and Socials and ELA up just a bit. But if it stays this mark i would go pure. Good luck!|`|FbyttXsvaa	AP is something offered to many schools while IB stands out.  Only at select schools, it stands out and universities will appreciate it much more.    IB is something you will regret not doing,  if you are lucky enough to be given the oppurtunity  for a program like the international baccelaureate  then GO for it!!!  You can do it ;)

65e1b564d76980b1d0a8d6dcb9b68309aa	Which refers back to Hamas,WHICH although a group of people is nevertheless an organization.  Therefore which is correct and not who.  If it mentioned a specific person in Hamas, who would be the proper pronoun..|`|5Z90vsGJaa	it is "which" in this case because Hamas is a group, not a person.|`|PleD8kgBaa	'Who' is used for individual persons.  "The man who ate 100 hot dogs felt proud, but a little sick."    'Who' is also used for groups of people in certain situations.  "The people who watched the man eat the hot dogs felt sick too."  "The children who watched the man eat the hot dogs wanted him to keep going."        But when we are talking about groups of people it can get a little tricky.      If we consider a particular group to be a collection of individuals, we use 'who.'  "The Detroit Lions, who lost every game this year, must feel like crying."    However, if we consider a particular group to be an organized unit, we use 'which.'  "The baseball team, which had been undefeated, lost its first game."    "Major League Baseball, which has been losing money, laid off three hundred workers."      If the sentence you quoted used "The members of Hamas" instead of "Hamas," we would use 'who.'  "The members of Hamas, who denied responsibility for that blast, then responded by launching a rocket, which landed harmlessly in Israel."    But if we used 'leadership' instead of 'members,' we would say 'which!'  This is because we think of 'leadership' as a unit, whereas 'members' are collected individuals.  "The leadership of Hamas, which denied responsibility for that blast, then responded by launching a rocket, which landed harmlessly in Israel."    How do you know which group of people is a unit and which is a collection of individuals?  Keep practicing!  Good luck!|`|AA10758468	Who is for people not organizations. Which is used with nonessential clauses.|`|7428c2399ac39bb8006f047995493c49aa	The sentence makes sense even if you leave out "which" or "who".  .|`|StJGeiFyaa	it should say "who." who refers to a person, whereas which refers to a thing.  the second "which" in the paragraph is correct because it is referring to the rocket.    That wave of attacks, said Israel, was in reprisal for a bomb that hit an Israeli patrol on the Gaza-Israel border, killing a soldier. Hamas, who denied responsibility for that blast, then responded by launching a rocket, which landed harmlessly in Israel.|`|buVqbDcpaa	Because Hamas is a group so its considered a thing instead of singular person.

H2V0Czq0aa	No. Your university's registration system will likely block you from registering from overlapping classes.     One exception might be if at least one class is technically an independent study, internship, thesis or something besides a traditional lecture or seminar.     Another exception might be if the two classes are somehow part of each other, such as a lecture and lab.     If you really want to take these two classes, talk to your adviser for your major and explain your situation. For instance, there was a ten minute overlap between my chemistry class and a lab from another chemistry class. The chemistry department let me and a few other students sign up for both classes and the professor did not mind that we were a little late.    But usually, one you cannot take two classes at the same time.|`|AA10948829	As in having more than one class? Yes. I currently am taking six (four lectures and two recitations, although the recitations don't count as a grade).

He cries excitedly, forgetting their mission, "'What a place for a fort!'" as Ralph urges them to move on for the sake of rekindling the signal fire on the mountain. The others pay Ralph little mind, including Jack. As if in another world, they roll rocks down the cliff face in glee; one large boulder Jack even fantasizes about using as a catapault-type weapon, "'Shove a palm trunk under that and if an enemy came.. we could catapult the rock to kill him"    2.)As the two look over the top of the rock, they see the dotted heads of the other boys far below them. The boys, seeing them, loose control in the excitement of exploration, and begin to flood over the rock bridge and towards the top as well. Some begin levering large rocks over the edge of the precipice. Punching the rock in frustration, Ralph shouts out loud:     "Stop it! Stop it! Smoke!"     His voice silences them:     "We want smoke. And you go wasting your time. You roll rocks."     3.)Roger and several of the other boys disagree. They would prefer to stay at Castle Rock, or go back to the beach, than go and relight the fire. In the end however, Ralph's continued fury wins them over. As he punches the rock again, taking all the skin off his knuckles, he rants:     "I'm chief...There's no signal showing. There may be a ship out there. Are you all off you're rockers?"     Mutinously, the onlookers fall silent, and begin to make their way down from the rock. They head for the mountain, to investigate where Samneric believed they had seen the beast, and to relight the fire.|`|hE1LrjIyaa	1. Jack suggests the new place could make a good place for a fort. He would use a palm trunk as a lever and roll boulders down the narrow cliff, pushing any enemies off the ledge and into the chasm.    2. Ralph is angered because the boys are wasting their time rolling rocks rather than maintaining the smoke signal that could get them saved.    3. Ralph insisted the boys return to camp and keep the fire going because he feared that a ship could be going past while they wasted their time playing around.

In the field of Business there are multiple areas of study.  Your are also talking about COMPUTERS.    You might first want to make a trip to the library and go through as many college catalogs as you can, taking some notes for yourself so that you can begin to decipher what you are interested in and what you are not.      Computers, today, are used in every major and research is part of the experience whether it is business, social sciences, health sciences, et al.  And in most fields, part of it is learning Management Skills.   So where do you begin?    You might want to start by figuring out what courses you already enjoy and whether or not you have some preferences.  See if your guidance counselor or career specialist can conduct some INTEREST INVENTORIES (no right or wrong TESTing) to see WHERE YOUR interests lie and perhaps identifying some of your skills.        From here, you might find it helpful to pull out some of your original notes and start looking at ALL the CAREER FIELDS those SKILLS CAN BE APPLIED TO.    EVER SO SLOWLY,  one or two majors will rise to the top of the list and you'll have a better idea where your talents and interests and TRANSFERABLE SKILLS are best served.  Be patient!  It's a process, but very worthwhile.    As you start applying to colleges, keep in mind you might want to include schools which offer fieldwork experiences as part of their curriculum.  Your researdh mightl be based on some of your own work experiences and may help you in the future!      Just remember, majors can be changed.  What's important is that you are happy doing the work you love.    Hope this was helpful!  Good luck!

I would work with your guidance counselor to determine an appropriate plan of action.  You will want or standardized test scores to be higher to remain competitive in the harder colleges.  I applied to ivys with a lower gpa then yours, although i went from a 2.5 freshman year to a 4.0 senior year, and got into both princeton and harvard.  If your gpa is a concern for you, do you have an increasing or decreasing trend? Furthermore, your gpa is quite solid, so i would definitely work on the test scores.  Your ACTs or SATs will matter the most; however, since you are taking 4 aps junior year or prior those scores will also matter to colleges, though honestly, i don't think they care about them that much.  You will be a weaker candidate in the top liberal arts colleges and universities, but you will still have a strong chance.    I wish you the best of luck finishing off junior year! Keep up the solid work!!  ps: don't listen to your parents, they just want you to keep trying, i promise!

LLq9uPi4aa	I did advanced standing.  The curriculum is standardized as required by the CSWE.  You can go to their website.    All schools require different GRE scores, and many do not require GRE at all.  Some don't require GRE if your last year of school you did well.  Many of the research/more competitive schools use GRE's to help screen out applicants. But in  a lot of social work schools GRE's are a small part of the equation--- post BSW experience is valuable, as is prior work experience in social services.

k2Jbp9e6aa	Please do not be embarrassed. You should be proud that your knowledge of English has taken you to such fine points.  "The" is a definite article.  It is used whenever the speaker and listener are assumed to know what they are talking about because of their personal experience.  When family members talk about taking "THE" dog for a walk, everyone knows that they are talking about "Rover." But a stranger seeing the outcome of this will say "She is taking A dog for a walk."  They know nothing about the family or Rover so they use the indefinite article "a."  So it is with the bus. If you are asking your neighbour how they intend to get downtown, you say "THE" bus, because you use the same bus that they do. But if you are talking to someone who lives in a distant town on the phone, and they tell you that they are going to travel to another distant city, you might say "Are you taking A train, A plane or A bus?" Because you have no  personal knowledge of their circumstances. They are just abstract possibilities.|`|StJGeiFyaa	An article is a word that combines with a noun to indicate the types of reference being made by the noun, and to specify the volume or numerical scope of that reference. The articles in the English language are the and a (with variant form an). An article is sometimes called a noun marker, although this is generally considered to be an archaic term.[1]  Articles are traditionally considered to form a separate part of speech. They can be also thought of as a special kind of adjective, because they combine with a noun and contribute to the meaning of the noun phrase. Linguists place them in the category of determiners.

IA93mU9Haa	Talk to your teachers. Ask them what they think you should do to receive a pass in those subjects. Remember, they studied the subject for years - They DO know what they are talking about.     In class, listen. Don't muck around, don't gossip, LISTEN. When your teacher is explaining something, LISTEN. If you don't understand what they're talking about, ASK. They are there to help you. Don't be afraid to talk to them! Always to your homework, do your assignments, and study for exams. And studying for exams doesn't mean reading as much as you can the night before, you need to be studying at least two weeks before the exam.    And last of all, ALWAYS DO YOUR BEST. There is no point of even doing something if you're not even going to try. If you don't know the answer on a question on an exam, guess. Its better than leaving it blank. Instead of getting zero, you might get half a mark, which could be the difference between a pass and a fail.

The dieseas that these travellers brought with them to the new world also cause the death of many. i.e. germs.

jaSConv1aa	What's the change of you rolling a 5 on the dice? The chance is 1/6 because the dice has 6 sides and you are hoping to get 1 specific side. Each time you roll it, the change of getting a 5 is 1/6. I don't know if you've learned about permutations in your math class yet. If not, you'll learn that the chance of doing some a certain amount of times means that you just multiply that change by itself for however many times.    (1/6) * (1/6) * (1/6) = 1 / 216|`|FzBA1R7Yaa	1/6 cuz theres 6 sides on the di and one 5. so its 1/6|`|xV0APOtaaa	Well you have the probability of rolling a five 1/6 each time (one side of the dice has a five on it out of a six-sided die)    Now the luck to roll a five three times in a row would be 1/6*1/6*1/6    So in reality you have a 1/36 chance of rolling a 5 three times straight.|`|DWit98Spaa	So let's think of it like this: What are the odds of rolling any number (1-6) on a dice? Well, there are six sides (six possibilities), and you can roll any of them. So of the 6 possible, you can roll 6/6 and still be successful.     But if you want to roll 3 5's in a row? The first roll, you will only be successful if you roll a "5", a specific side. So that first roll you have a 1/6 shot.    For the second roll, again, you will only be successful if you roll a 5, so you only have one shot at being successful, therefore another 1/6    and the same for the final roll, you have a 1/6 shot. So the odds of rolling 3 straight 5's is the product of those:     (1/6)x(1/6)x(1/6) = 1/216.|`|y09wh1CZaa	see probabilty = no. of fav outcomes/ total no. of outcomes .. so     no. of fav outcome is only one i.e 555 right  total probabilty is 6x6x6 =216 bcas no. can come in any oder     hence = 1/216  or u can see it this way also   1st roll 5 will come = 1/6  2nd roll 5 will come = 1/6   3rd roll 5 will come = 1/6  so 1/6x1/6x1/6=1/216
DQlZIzAFaa	Alright, personal experience: I went from Algebra II to Pre-Calc back in high school. I thought trig wasn't worth my time and Pre-Calc looks better on transcripts for college (which it does, btw).    HOWEVER, depending on what you want to major in in college and what college you go to, trig might be worth it. I failed calculus twice in college because I didn't understand trig, even though I got A's in Pre-Calc. If you want to do something math/science I would take both if you can. Otherwise, do whichever. Pre-calc is almost exactly like algebra II, except the problems take longer (it's not harder, just more time).|`|iqcbvMPQaa	you should only do this if you were in advanced algebra 2 where you covered a majority of trignometry... some classes already incorporate trig into algebra 2.ex. sin, cos, stuff like that.. trig is kinda the basis for calc.. but if you are super self motivated then yea its not a bad thing...   i think its best to do trig than you can go to calculus bc and skip calculus ab

jtoxFsdYaa	The old saying goes "A little knowledge is a dangerous thing", so being highly intelligent must be deadly!!!|`|qEy34ueZaa	A lousy student once remarked: "The more I learn, the more I forget. The more I forget, the less I can remember. The less I can remember, the less I know. So why learn, in first place?".  It is my opinion, that the more one knows, the better one can function in our complex society. However, in every single course I had to take, I could never avoid the feeling of how much I did not know, or how much I still needed to learn. I also concluded, that no matter the period in history, there had not been one single person who knew about everything! That ended-up making me feel less ignorant!

kpi69PHWaa	A 3.3 without doing your homework and ditching a lot isn't bad. But it definitely doesn't show you're smart. So then by your definition, you are currently no one.   Give it a real shot. In that case, you're either smart and have balls or at the very least a hard worker with balls. Both of which are WAY above someone who is smart but doesn't do anything   (which I have seen, and TRUST ME, PLEASE TRUST ME, you DON'T want to be one of those brilliant people who does nothing! You end up smoking pot, doing drugs for years. Then going back to community college and trying to do something a couple times, but you keep quitting because you've convinced yourself you're better than community college or the professors that teach there, and end up doing nothing ever. You will be a lot happier even if you find out you are not a genius, even if you are just a person with average intelligence but who is smart enough to do something with their life.)|`|CtwEFHcqaa	If you actually tried you would get it.

It doesn't even mean you're not as smart as you thought you were. It really only means you didn't manage to master the material.    I do understand how you feel. I felt exactly the same way. My whole self image was bound up in my intelligence. But learning isn't always effortless or smooth even for highly intelligent people. And the best way to improve your intellectual skills is to learn.     You know how many Asian kids excel in school? They aren't all born brilliant, but they are very disciplined about studying. NOT thinking about themselves, but about the material they are learning. NOT getting upset with themselves if they get a B when they thought they knew something well, but going back and working on the material until it's mastered. Of course it's not just true for Asian kids, but they're a good example.     Just do the work, Wouldn't it be better to give your all and get a B than to do it halfway and get a C? Just try it. Challenge yourself.|`|orShbrf3aa	Just try your best! No one is perfect. Its obvious you are smart if you have good grades.|`|4WIXuugcaa	but you would be REALLY stupid if you didnt try
LLq9uPi4aa	It's good to have a business background in lots of careers, and a double-major in theater and business is possible, but it costs tuition.  What do you want to do when you're done?  You should major in which ever your future employer would value more, probably.  Otherwise, you can pick up the skills on the side, probably in a less costly way.  Usually an employer doesn't care how many minors you have, it doesn't add any prestige.  You should visit the departments and see which ones you feel the best groove in, too, at your potential school.    Yahoo answers is a world wide service.   What area are you looking for "good schools" in?  Are you looking for good as in prestigious or good as in friendly?  You should start with a bit of your own research and give more info about what you're looking for.  :)|`|GR9mmWxVaa	i guess u can there isnt no law restricting u hell u can study all majors u want|`|iqcbvMPQaa	absolutely, a lot of people double major and do a minor... and i dont think its all that great asking someone what they would prefer is the best.. take several of the ge classes and that way you will be able to decide whether you actually are interested in those major..      alot of people think they like it and they actually change majors...      well good luck..

AA11765949	Realpolitik (literally meaning real politics) is the practice of politics independent of moral or ethical considerations, usually for the advancement of the national interests of a country.     One of the most famous proponents was Niccolo Machiavelli, best known for his Il Principe (The Prince). Machiavelli held that the sole aim of a prince was to seek power, regardless of religious or ethical considerations. The ancient Greek historian Thucydides, who wrote the History of the Peloponnesian War, is also cited as an intellectual forebearer of realpolitik.     Other significant practitioners of realpolitik include Otto von Bismarck and Count Camillo Benso di Cavour.     In the "realist school" of Anglo-Saxon Political Science of the late 20th century this term is mostly used as a synonym for power politics. The policy of Realpolitik was introduced to the Nixon White House by Henry Kissinger. In this context, the policy meant dealing with other powerful nations in a practical manner, i.e. diplomacy with the People's Republic of China rather than containment.|`|PleD8kgBaa	Basically, realpolitik means that you do whatever is necessary to get, maintain, and extend your power.  Ideologies don't matter.  What matters is that you find ways to arrange a balance of power that works to your benefit.      Both Cavour and Bismark worked to form the nations of Italy and Germany (respectively) out of a patchwork of smaller and often rival states.  They used whatever means necessary in order to achieve their goals.      I think you'd have to argue that Bismark was more successful.  He actually saw a united Germany in his lifetime, while Cavour died before his dream was realized.
74f5e4e698a7718dfb254fa5418f938baa	This isn't the most common advise, but it's something that I do.  I divide the book up into parts or sections and set a time-frame to work with that keeps be under the deadline of when I am supposed to complete the book.  I keep a notebook and pencil nearby when I am reading so that I can make a note.  The note can be about a character, event, random thought or question.  When I take a break from reading or have completed a section I take my notebook (and the book for reference) to the library so that I can do research to learn what I might not have understood before.  This is a bit more work than just reading the book in it's entirety, but I've found that the breaks help me to focus when I need to without pressuring myself or tiring out too quickly.  Sometimes it's very fun.|`|AA10418744	You can check that thru the internet. You can read the plot first and be familiar with the characters. Then you can enjoy reading the book and understand it well.

Clt9uTmNaa	I have a cousin who has DS, and when I was really young I didn't understand him, and was actually very afraid of him.  I got to see him maybe once a year, and he was much older and much bigger than me.  He's really nice, but at my age at the time, the things that stood out to me were him loving wrestling, and yelling for cheeseburgers from burger king.  All I could picture him doing was taking his wrestling stuff animal, and imitating what he saw on tv with it.  The body slams and yelling were too much for me, and not understanding what DS really was just made me fear him, and others with DS.    At one point in elementary school I was assigned a project to help out in the special ed classroom.  I look back at it now and feel horrible, but I know I probably did make faces at them, but simply because I really just didn't understand.    When I got older I actually got to know a teenager with DS really well.  He was a family friend that would go out with us often.  I got to see things a lot clearer.  He was just a regular very sweet teenager that still very much had a child in him.  He liked to play, and make others smile.  I think getting close to him, and becoming friends with him made me understand others with DS a lot better.  When I was young I knew they weren't bad people, but they were different.  Having a not so personable reaction to others who are different is just a normal human emotion.    With all that being said, I guess what I'm trying to say is just get close to them.  Make them your friends, talk to them, find out what's their favorite food and tv show.  Eventually, you'll understand them better, and will be able to walk in the room with an excited face to see them.  Not only will you learn a lot from them, but it will mean a lot to them for you to take the time to get to know them.|`|eeBBtPA6aa	Just don't make a face, you can stop that from happening. Always put the shoe on the other foot in any situation. How would you feel as someone in their situation and someone looked at you like that? Would you feel welcome? How would you feel if you were a parent and saw anything less than a smile? Since you work in a church nursery seems like you should pray about it. If you cannot control this, please do the children a favor and stop watching them. A DS child will remember that face and scream the next time they see you.|`|PnlgLBcwaa	how about looking at pictures online to get used to is and get it out of your system-    maybe tehr are videos on you tube-  when it becomes natural-you will react naturally|`|dBpmyIduaa	As long as you are kind to them and interact nicely with them you will be fine.  DS children are very lovable and they bond very easily with others.  You sound like a great person and I admire you for what you are doing!|`|bZud91iuaa	First: They are not weird, just different.  Treat them as you would any other person.  They are not looking for special treatment.  Too many people talk down to them and act as though they understand nothing.  They are truly innocent and loving human beings.  You should be used to the facial characteristics by now so don't act surprised.  Give out what you expect to receive back from anybody and you will be richly rewarded for your service
mhFpZT3laa	Absolutely, clinical experience is the best way to prove to yourself and to the admissions folk that you want to do medicine.    1) The basics    To begin any pre-med resume, you have to have the things that most medical schools expect a pre-med to have done. They want to see that you have done community service, because this shows that you are interested in helping others and have compassion. They want to see that you have had leadership experience, because you will be in charge of a number of nursing, techs, etc, and good leadership is necessary when you are dealing with people's health or lives. They want to see that you have done clinical volunteering, so that you have seen doctors and patients interacting and are interested in helping people medically. They want to see that you have shadowed doctors (probably less important than the volunteering), so that you have a better grasp of what you are getting yourself into. I personally would recommend at least one year of clinical work or volunteering. It would be best if you started this year no later than your junior year, so that it doesn't ring of last minute resume buffing (salt shaker alert here, this is just the common consensus among pre-meds that I know). If you do your year of volunteering at the beginning of your Freshman year, I would recommend that you punctuate the remaining years with shadowing and short term medical stuff like a blood drive or two, so you don't have to explain why you suddenly stopped all medical related activities. The last "basic" is always useful, but only absolutely necessary when applying to heavy-weight research schools, and that is research. Off the top of my head I believe that 93% of acceptances at U of Michigan were given to students with research experience last year. Similar stats occur at other research schools. It doesn't have to be medically related research, so long as you were part of the creation of new knowledge. Publications are nice, so I would suggest getting started on this early in your undergrad years.    Remember, you can list activities that you began before college, so long as you continued them in college. Everything else must be after high school to be most effective. I cannot offer much advice to non-traditional applicants, but I would assume that the rules are a bit more relaxed for you, especially if you were, say, a Fullbright scholar ten years ago.    2) Have something that will make your readers say "Gee, I want to meet this applicant!"    There is no such thing as a guaranteed acceptance. I know people who were accepted at Top 10 schools, only to be rejected post-interview from their state school that they were highly competitive at in terms of academics. A 4.0 and a 45T alone isn't going to get you accepted everywhere, though I wouldn't go so far as to say as it wouldn't get you anywhere. For the rest of us mortals, though, extracurriculars are the best way to make ourselves stand out from the pack. As such, have an activity that is really unique, because these things can be quite strong selling points. For me, it was being involved in some post-post-post-post modern dance performances. You have plenty of time to pick up something that is off the beaten pre-med path, so have an interest that isn't what you would normally find in a room full of scientists. There's a reason that the top schools are always telling us how their students are marathon runners, Olympic competitors, composers, singers, and the like. For one, its just plain cool and impressive, and so those are the students they highlight. However, even the students who aren't quite as stand alone as that will often have things that are still pretty interesting to hear about. This desire for interesting applicants occurs at every medical school, and an interesting activity might land you an interview at your dream school. I'm not saying that you should fill your resume with nothing but outlandish activities, but one or two ice breakers will be very helpful.    2) Combine your interests and talents with your activities    This goes hand in hand with my first point, but it can really improve your extracurriculars when you combine your activities. Say you go volunteer at the VA or at a hospice, and on the side you take violin lessons. Why not go play your violin at the VA or hospice? If you want to help out a community service, why not run in a charity marathon if you happen to be a runner? Avid painter? Teach a painting class to inner city youth, or paint a mural for a community center. Be creative, it will mean a lot more to the people you help as well as the person reviewing your application.      3) Represent your message    If you want to go into academic medicine, research, public health, etc, make sure that you can justify it. If you tell your interviewer that you absolutely love teaching, but you haven't done anything teaching related (according to your resume), you risk making yourself look fake.|`|NDKRgPCnaa	It will help. Do it because you're passionate about it, not because you want a polished application. This will be ONE of many cherries on top of the cake that will be called your application.

FZKFLTyLaa	Bullets : it's a continuation of more or less a sentence. I find the no caps acceptable.  No need for 2nd use of USD.  No caps, again.  We accept major credit cards ( Visa, MasterCard, and the others).|`|ee2eb688bade7663b57e940f752dc454aa	1.) If the government writes it with lower case letters, I'd follow suit.  2.) I think the first reference of USD is sufficient.  3.) I wouldn't capitalize government sales specialist.  4.) You could add "We accept purchase orders, bank wire transfers and major credit cards." Or, better, list the cards you do accept. ..."and American Express, Discover, MasterCard and VISA."|`|KegxJHn5aa	1.) Do you see where the bullet points are at the top? If you notice, each bulleted item starts with a lower case letter. I wrote it that way because the government will write the same way. However, I am not sure if I should be using capitals. Which is more appropriate?    a.) Normally, you should capitalize the first letter after a bullet. I can only imagine that this would be the exact same instance. I would use the capitals. They tend to work fine, even on most government articles.      2.) If you go down a little bit, you will see where it says "The minimum purchase amount for a PO is $500 USD.". In the next sentence, I say $500 again, but I don't include the "USD" because I have stated it. Is that appropriate or should I include USD?    b.) To keep unnecessary words out of your paper is your primary concern, along with organizing the entire thing well enough so that you don't get a failing grade immediately. I don't remember this well, so you're guess is as good as mine, but I believe it would be the former choice here. No second USD.      3.) In the part that says "To place an order, please call our government sales specialist at 1-800-296-0820 ext. 837" Should "government sales specialist" be written as Government Sales Specialist or is it correct the way I have it?    c.) Government sales specialist wouldn't be capitalized unless you're speaking about someone in specific. Which, in this case, you are. The Government Sales Specialist you're told to contact. This situation has more then two choices, but you've probably got it under control.      4.) My last question is regarding the first paragraph that states: "Albany Distributing is committed to providing quality products at the best prices for our education, federal, state, and local agencies. We accept purchase orders, credit cards, and bank wire transfer."    Where it says "Credit cards", I want to somehow incorporate Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover in there so they know we accept all major credit cards. How can I reword this to sound good?    d.) The best option you could take would be to fit in a parenthesis and list off the top four or five credit card companies that come to minded, follow with an "etc." So, it should probably come out like:    "Albany Distributing is committed to providing quality products at the best prices for our education, federal, state, and local agencies. We accept purchase orders, credit cards (Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Discover, etc.), and bank wire transfer."      Feel free to edit anything. I'm not the brightest dude around.|`|PleD8kgBaa	The * is there for emphasis.    1. I'd cap Government, Hospital*s*, Schools because they are items in a list.    2. $500 without USD is ok.  3.

fUBhCh7Kaa	im not familiar with the % rating for high schools. but lets put it this way... right now a lot of kids are going to a community college for the first 1-2 years and then going to a university aferwards if needed. I wish i would have done that. I would have saved over 60 G's. Seriously take even a semester at a community college even to get your gpa up it that is what you are worried about. I had a low gpa in hs and still got into a state school in Illinois actually 2 state schools and well i ended up going to ASU in arizona... I hear they take anyone and its FUN!!!! I had a blast.

U could try it.|`|lU8ucOpjaa	honestly- don't be worried.  you can always go to a community school (who will take you if you have a pulse) and transfer into anywhere you want and pretty easily too!    dont worry about it. im sure yu will be fine|`|EPVW8Ukeaa	I am in a kind of similar situation- I am so nervous and worried I won't get into college! This senior year has been CRAZY with college stuff that I haven't been spending as much time on my grades and schoolwork as I should have been. I just got my 1st semester grades and they were pretty bad (I didn't fail any classes but I had 2 Cs). I'm really freaking out because the colleges see those midyear reports and I'm scared they won't accept me based on my senior year 1st semester grades. I only applied to one private school and this is my first choice and as luck would have it this is the only one that my midyear report will be sent to (since UCs- I live in California- don't get the midyears).

It is true that some colleges are more difficult to get into than others, however, if you keep a positive attitude and try your best I am sure that you will be perfectly fine. I originally planned to major in nursing as well, however, within the first semester I determined that nursing was really for me and this may happen to you as well, but if you really want something you can do it! Don't get down, there are many who have faith in you and who will be proud when you get accepted and even more when you walk down the aisle at your college graduation!

"A wise man learns from his own mistakes. A wiser man learns from the mistakes of others."    "Peace, she supposed, was contingent upon a certain disposition. A disposition that only detachment from self made possible."  (Read inbetween the lines for that one) i.e. One can only find peace and serenity when one is selfless and open minded.    Here's a good one:    "To be content with little, difficult. To be content with much, impossible."      And here's one I just made up!    "Perspective is like clay. To accentuate the positive and eliminate the negative from thought, we create the foundation for realization."    Also    "If one desires jelly on his bread, then jelly it well. If another desires jelly on their bread, give them yours and be content with this compassion. Joy is always so close."    Share wisdom, it's fun ^_^

S4QBvAaGaa	I don't think you should lower your standards, though a gander at them might prove helpful in any case. What type of girl would you like to be with anyway?  I feel like you do a lot of self-analyzation, or maybe it's the fact that you asked this question, but I don't think focusing on what you might be much longer could help you find someone else, "find" definitely being the word here since you seem to be so...frustrated?  Your upbringing seems to have had the largest hand in making you who you are but you're not being brought up anymore. You're raising yourself from now on and you decide what you put in your life and what you don't, regardless of past stains. Many people grow up in peculiar circumstances and the realization, which you seem to have grasped, that your situation was odd should, if anything, empower you to embrace all the things you couldn't touch or didn't believe to be wrong. With some skill, gained by trial and error, in the workings of social interaction, you could be a charming sex machine in no time but! This would be considered the opposite of what you might have been considering wouldn't it? Change what people see or change what you're looking at. You seem like a nice, though confused, enough guy so let people see what they want, and focus your sights on something other than yourself.  Good Luck! :)|`|CBPL6Tp6aa	how can you lower your standards any lower than they are? your talking about picking up girls with mental problems? any lower than that are probably hookers or...corpses...    but as for your social problems...you need to slowly immerse yourself around people and each time give a little more..like a smile to a girl in your class you sit next too gradually developing some sort of relationship...friend if you like...    you just have to put yourself out there..you dont have anything to lose

And with the CA budget crisis, the UCs have limited space right now.     USC, as a private college, does not prioritize.    If you're only a freshman, you can go to a CC for a year and then transfer as a junior for a shot at a UC. They're half the price of USC.

In my state, Maryland, you will need to have a degree in education (it can be in another field, but you would have to take additional training) and complete your licensing exams, plus a semester's internship.  This is for public school.  For private schools, it generally doesn't matter what your degree is in.  Depending on the school, you may need additional training as well.  National certification requires more training and tests.  You would need a degree in Early Childhood Education.|`|LRVxW4gAaa	Typically you need a Bachelor's degree in Early Education and pass your Praxis exams.

yGOmMQP7aa	Doing a fafsa when a person is self employed is a tough one.  The reason being is they can take "expenses" out before any of their income is counted as wages.  (EXAMPLE:  A truck driver may make 150,000 a year, but because they have Business expenses like gasoline and a huge semi truck payment their income would actually be a lot less because of this.  Think: a $12,000 a year salary with a good accountant and good record keeping).  <br>  <br>  I normally discourage people from using estimated info for the fafsa, ( I tell them to wait for the actual forms to be filled out) but if you have a state or college deadline coming up, you would prob be best to use your folks 07 taxes and mark "WILL FILE" as the answer to if they have done their taxes yet.  Then realize the info is estimated and INCORRECT and you will need to go back and change it when they actually do their taxes.<br>  <br>  Good luck

ykyMSEKGaa	This is a very good question and the only explanation I have is that they want to make sure you can reason and figure complicated things out therefore giving you credibility to take on a difficult task and completing it.  So my approach was to just get through all that crap and immediately forget it as soon as I didn't need it and sure enough I feel I have only needed maybe 10% of what I learned in college.  The rest is tedious busy work that makes you spend valuable time, energy and money on something that makes one very bitter.

Universities that aren't accredited (like DeVry and Heald) can create whatever kind of curriculum they want. They only require classes that are directly related to the degree, so that you can go to school two nights a week and one weekend day and still graduate in 18 months. However, this cheapens the value of the degree. If you go to one of these colleges, there is no way you will get into a decent graduate program, and you may have some trouble finding a job compared to people from an accredited university.    Accredited colleges have to give you general education. This is simply one of the things required of them to be accredited. That means that when you have your bachelor's degree, it shows future employers or graduate programs that you not only have specific knowledge in your degree field, you also have broad knowledge and skills.    It's true that you may never use calculus in your career. But you will learn problem solving skills that you WILL use in your career.    Talking more specifically about math, I believe that people generally retain only a portion of the math that they have learned in school. For instance, since you are taking Finite Mathematics and Applied Calculus, in several years you will only remember the most basic derivatives as well as some algebra. And this is enough to get by. When I was in orientation at an industrial job, we were learning how to find the mean and range of a set of measurements. Being a college graduate at the time, this was of course a piece of cake. The other people there were factory workers with a high school education. They struggled with this simple task, and in fact thought that 10.6 was smaller than 10.52, because 6 is smaller than 52. The last math class they would have taken would have been geometry or algebra 2, and several years later they struggle with basic math. If you had it your way, and didn't have to take any math that seemed irrelevant, you would have made the same mistake.    Additionally, haven't you heard that most college graduates cannot fully understand a credit card application? The more math education you can get in college, the better prepared you will be for real-world math situations.|`|EeQ6qL52aa	To get more money from you before you graduate|`|Xn9ELUeXaa	In case you enter a job that requires it or else it gives the university a bad rep.|`|QCL7WIEtaa	Cause you will have to do a lot of stuff in the work world you will think is B.S.

nKtP8p4haa	It would be (1/25xy^(7/9))  Whenever you have a negative exponent you put it under 1. For example if you have 2^(-2/3) you would change it to 1/2^(2/3) to have positive exponents. I think the word problem would have you draw a triangle. The hypotenuse would be 15 and the base would be 12. Then you do the Pythagorean theorem which would be 12^2+X^2=15^2 Then it turns into 144+X^2=225. You subtract 144 from 225 to get 81. Then its X^2=81. You take the square root of 81 which is 9 and that is the height.

A 15 inch TV set also has a width of 12 inches. What is the height?.....      We know that the television screen is being measured.  It's also same to assume that the television screen has 4 corners, which means than it has 4 right angles.  Because of this we can use the Pythagorean theorem  A squared + B squared = C squared.  A and B represents the distances of the 2 sides of the triangle that have the right angle between them.  C is the hypotenuse, or the diagonal.    If the television set is "15 inches" that means that   C=15    We can say that the width is 12 inches and will represent A.    12 squared + x squared = 15 squared    144 + x squared = 225  -144                     -144  x squared = 81  take the square root of both sides  x = 9    Glad I could help you to understand!!|`|RjhlypQWaa	1. you just need to remember that a negative exponent is always the same base but just as a fraction.     so (25xy)^(-7/9) = (25xy)^(-1 x 7/9)    this is the same as ((25xy)^-1))^7/9    so break it up, it will make it easier.  first, (25xy)^-1 = 1/(25xy)    then the next part:  put it back together:  (1/(25xy))^7/9    2. you want to draw a rectangle, where two sides equal 12 inches each.    then draw a diagonal. Now solve the triangle that you have left.  if h=height, then you have a triangle where the base = 12in and the diagonal equals 15in. and you have to solve for h.     so use pythagorean theorem:  a^2+b^2=c^2  so:  12^2+h^2=15^2    = 144+ h^2 = 225  h^2= 225-144=81  so h= sqrt(81)= 9    so the height is 9in.    hope this helps.

xFcvh2KKaa	Characteristics of Civilizations (1953)    Language  Separate civilizations regularly possess distinct languages.  However . . . civilizations are more often than not bilingual or multilingual.    Religion  An institutionalized and codified religion tends to accompany each empirical civilizational unit.    Political and Military Development  An idea of some sort of rule, dominion, or preeminence of strength has long been intertwined with that of civilization and remains associated with it.    Economy  It will probably also be admitted that a great civilization can hardly arise without the presence of an economic surplus.      Technology  While the correlation of inventions with entities of higher civilization is not conspicuously high, because of diffusion, technological advances are the most persistently accumulative.    Style  Most civilizations develop a set of characteristic basic styles to which they then adhere as long as they continue.|`|AA10418744	Civilizations have been distinguished by their means of subsistence, types of livelihood, settlement patterns, forms of government, social stratification, economic systems, literacy, and other cultural traits.

He was the first person to find that Jupiter has four moons.    3. He made the first telescope powerful enough to let him see the planets clearly.     Have fun! :]|`|T3TDOoGPaa	i would like to add a few facts which the 1st guy omitted.as he said galileo was a scienticst and was an italian.he discoverd the first telescope.he has played an important role in the development of modern science and was the pioneer in bringing scientific knowledge to europe and made europe change from it's dark ages.he was arrested and killed for his copernicus theory  which was converse to the teachings of chiurch and the then beliefs.he lived just before the advent of renaiscence and his work helped to gain popularity for it..sorry he was not murdered but placed under house arrest until he died.  Galileo Galilei (15 February 1564[2]  8 January 1642)[1][3] was a Tuscan physicist, mathematician, astronomer, and philosopher who played a major role in the Scientific Revolution. His achievements include improvements to the telescope and consequent astronomical observations, and support for Copernicanism. Galileo has been called the "father of modern observational astronomy",[4] the "father of modern physics",[5] the "father of science",[5] and "the Father of Modern Science."[6] The motion of uniformly accelerated objects, taught in nearly all high school and introductory college physics courses, was studied by Galileo as the subject of kinematics. His contributions to observational astronomy include the telescopic confirmation of the phases of Venus, the discovery of the four largest satellites of Jupiter, named the Galilean moons in his honour, and the observation and analysis of sunspots. Galileo also worked in applied science and technology, improving compass design.    Galileo's championing of Copernicanism was controversial within his lifetime. The geocentric view had been dominant since the time of Aristotle, and the controversy engendered by Galileo's presentation of heliocentrism as proven fact resulted in the Catholic Church's prohibiting its advocacy as empirically proven fact, because it was not empirically proven at the time and was contrary to the literal meaning of Scripture.[7] Galileo was eventually forced to recant his heliocentrism and spent the last years of his life under house arrest on orders of the Roman Inquisition.    refer wikipedia.org and just simply type galileo galily and u will get a lot of result.sorry about the spelling mistakes|`|RjhlypQWaa	So, this is will probably be the start of a bad habit but wikipedia is a great resource for knowledge, but it doesn't count as a scholarly source.

d5496125c875f9bc89b57a83b9c7fcccaa	The US government derives Unemployment figures from information submitted by the states which shows the number of people claiming unemployment benefits in the state. It is compared to the number of employed people which the us government allready has from tax collecting information. These numbers do not include all people that are looking for work. They only include the people that are currently claiming benefits for being unemployed. This number can be quite different from the actual number of people that are seeking work ESPECIALLY when times are hard in a certain region such as GEORGIA, MICHIGAN and OHIO right now. In hard times the people run out of benefits before they get a job. If the president has an attitude  like George Bush and refuses to extend the benefit period then the president can brag about how low the unemployment rate is when the people are just leaving because their benefits ran out and not because they found a job.  <br>  <br>  I ran a survey on this site and asked for only responders who were unemployed.

384a694dd63e2999e377591b36a97091aa	I think there are many reasons why speaking English in Indian classrooms is beneficial. Firstly, knowledge of the English language is important in international politics and commerce. English is often considered the lingua franca of international commerce, when you get a group of businessmen together, they will all have their native tongues, but it's likely they all know enough English to hold a meeting together. Secondly, knowing any foreign language (particularly English) allows an individual the opportunity to travel and seek employment in foreign countries.<br>  <br>  I think it's important that Indians preserve their native languages and culture, but I think that the influence of their homes and the entertainment industry should be more than enough to maintain those languages.<br>  <br>  Also interesting to note is that currently there are more English speakers in India than anywhere else in the world.|`|243b61ea8af254c52c7c807ea9693c46aa	its d universal language, to communicate one another, here n d Philippines its widely use n im not fluent in English, its hard but no choice, n we also hav 2 pronounce it well lyk an American, gosh!!!|`|cbac27d53140b5b1a91e33ea8decd42eaa	Nowadays indians think that if a person can not speak english propperly, the person is an illeterate person. So it has become a neccessity to know english. The advantage of knowing how to speak english is that we know one of the many languages spoken throughout the wold. it will help us if we need to go abroad for our higher studies.<br>  It's disadvantage is that after we know english we start looking down upon people whose english is poor. that creates a difference (bhed bhav as called i hindi) between we indians. We think that we have drived the british completly away, but we have not! We still give inmportance to their language n their movies.

In Egypt, Joseph became an advisor to the pharaoh, and was eventually reconciled with his brothers when they came to Egypt during a famine.

aefc8f534d45df0386bea2d95e71a49daa	On June 28, 1914, Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, the nephew of Emperor Franz Joseph and heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, and his wife, Sophie, duchess of Hohenburg, were assassinated in Sarajevo, then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. The conspiracy involved Gavrilo Princip, a Bosnian Serb student. Gavrilo Princip was part of a group of fifteen assailants, who formed the Young Bosnia group, acting with support from the Black Hand, some members of which were part of the Serbian government.<br>  <br>  Following the assassination, the Austro-Hungarian government, supported by their German allies, determined to punish the Serbians for the assassination, and on July 23 sent an ultimatum to the Serbs with demands so extreme that it was expected to be rejected. The Serbians, relying on the hope of support from Russia, gave an equivocal response which led to Austrian rejection, and to a declaration of war on July 28. The Russians mobilized in support of their Serbian allies. First, this was only partial mobilization, directed against only the Austrian frontier. On July 31, after the Russian high command told the emperor that this was logistically impossible, a general mobilization was ordered. The German war plan, which relied on a quick strike against the Russians' French allies while the Russian army slowly mobilized, could not afford to allow the Russians to begin mobilization without launching their attack on the west. As such, the Germans declared war against Russia on August 1 and against France two days later, immediately launching an invasion of Luxembourg and Belgium to get around the fortifications along the Franco-German border. This violation of Belgium's neutrality led to a British declaration of war on Germany on August 4. With this declaration, five of the six great European powers became involved in the first European general war since the Napoleonic Wars.<br>  <br>  Although World War I was triggered by this chain of events unleashed by the assassination, the war's origins go deeper, involving national politics, cultures, economics, and a complex web of alliances and counterbalances that developed between the various European powers over the course of the nineteenth century, following the final 1815 defeat of Napoleon Bonaparte and the ensuing Congress of Vienna.|`|AA11588385	<a href="http://www.firstworldwar.com/origins/causes.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.firstworldwar.com/origins/cau...</a>|`|1a9e4d57320cb7594a39fb95ad34cf07aa	The assassination of the Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife Sophie led to the system of military alliances to react to the situation like a set of dominos leading to tragic consequences (hey I did it in one sentence).  <br>  <br>  For more detail I would go to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_war_one" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_war_o...</a>|`|5b7a8f9cc1505e51ca791078576ed1afaa	The official cause of the WWIII was the assasination of Franz Feridand, the archduke and his wife Sophie, but that was just an excuse.

Dh0JX2Onaa	A C is not a good grade for even an AP class.

If it is 6 then the denominator of the second sum is 24 too.

65e1b564d76980b1d0a8d6dcb9b68309aa	I disagree with the people who object to the inclusion of the adjective forlorn saying that it means the same as solitude and, therefore, redundant.  I thought the same way until I looked up "forlorn" in the dictionary.  It very specifically defines a particular kind of solitude, thereby adding to the meaning of the word.  According to the Encarta dictionary, forlorn describes the feeling of  desolation and desertion or feeling abandoned and neglected.  You do not get these meanings from the word solitude  alone.    PS.  As the first person said, the sentence does not need any editing.  It is simple, clear and direct.|`|zV1H5hvhaa	"My books" sounds better.|`|6C9ap59paa	One of the meanings of the word "forlorn" is lonely. So using both forlorn and solitude together is superfluous. You could instead say,"In my dreary solitude, my only companions were my piano and books."|`|213df96cd601a86457f2e97e4a811bb8aa	I think the use of forlorn can be changed -- unnecessary adjective weaken a sentence.

It's a slight hint or start of an intuition about something. You can, for example, have an inkling that your position in a chess game is going to deteriorate or has an opportunity to win decisively. This is the kind of thing that motivates you to look more closely and analytically at the possibilities you had an inkling about.    A slight tummy twinge is an inkling of stomach distress. Further down the line is "Oh gee, I'm gonna be sick!".|`|LnWFVZeZaa	Yep|`|2jJQ66O7aa	Yes, I get strong inklings about all sorts of things....most of which, are usually quite accurate.

AA10067221	Here are a few examples:    __1. -Cyber-bullying: cyberbullying is defined as "willful and repeated harm inflicted through the use of computers, cell phones, and other electronic devices."  Cyber-bullying has grown as a means of threatening, intimidating or harassing others over the past several years. It can take many forms, including posting private or embarrassing photos of someone, developing websites to rate peoples appearance, creating hateful blogs about someone, stealing electronic passwords, or spreading lies.   http://www.cyberbullying.us/index.php    __2. -The Pursuit of Perfection: This conflict is regarding the amount of pressure parents, schools, the media, and peers put on teens to be "perfect," successful, beautiful, etc.   In addition to the potential for individual harm, there is an absolutely certain cultural harm related to the mass pursuit and glorification of physical perfection. In her 1992 bestseller, The Beauty Myth, Naomi Wolf describes a $33 billion "thinness industry", a $20 billion "youth industry", and a $300 million "cosmetic surgery industry" and admonishes the commercial forces propelling women towards never ending external improvements. The marketing of plastic surgery to a younger and younger clientele only intensifies a conspiracy that requires women to be evaluated by homogenized perceptions of beauty instead of more integrated and realistic virtues. Why would any of us want to live in a world that requires all of us from 14-year-olds to 50-year-olds  to have Britney Spears' breasts, Reese Whiterspoon's nose and a 4-year-olds' crease free forehead? All women are the losers in this game and we are already in the fifth inning if 20-somethings are scheduling Botox injections and teens are requesting painful surgical procedures as presents.   http://www.jewishworldreview.com/0205/ma...    __3. -School Burn-Out: This conflict is concerning the amount of school-related activities and requirements teens face now in high school & how that often leads to "school burn-out." Faced with an unlimited amount of choices combined with the pressure of a fast-paced-world, teens are spreading their selves too thin by engaging in a number of commitments.    __4. -To Work or Not To Work:  The topic of high school employment is often an overlooked conflict young people face.  This conflict debates why it is either acceptable or not acceptable for teens to have jobs during their high school years. Many teens disregard the benefits of choosing academics over employment and become less focused in their pursuit of an education, while some teens are forced to work in order to provide for themselves and their families.    __5. - Surviving the Social Scene in High School: This conflict is regarding the social issues of high school. Searching for a comfortable identity as well as a social group to belong to, teens can sometimes get caught up in the popularity contests, cat fights, bickering, etc., getting involved with drama-prone people, the "wrong crowd", or  a limited group, where they can become isolated and easily influenced.  Typically, conflict arises when the individual tries to go against the main beliefs or habbits of the teen group or tries to make friends outside of the group.|`|mb2Otvunaa	Young people are so concerned about being "in" being "with the cool crowd".

AA10418744	1. Factoring Polynomials      This lesson will show how to find the factors of a given product. The lesson will include the following six types of factoring:   Group  1: Greatest Common Factor  Group  2: Grouping  Group  3: Difference in Two Squares  Group  4: Sum or Difference in Two Cubes  Group  5: Trinomials  Group  6: General Trinomials       Example Group  1    Factoring out the Greatest Common Factor (GCF) is perhaps the most used type of factoring because it occurs as part of the process of factoring other types of products. Before you can factor trinomials, for example, you should check for any GCF.       1: Factor the following problem completely    Look for the greatest factor common to every term   2   Factor out the GCF by dividing it into each term                       2: Factor the following problem completely    In this problem, the greatest common factor includes both numbers and variables. First we need to factor out the greatest number that will divide into both 15 and 9. In this case, it will be a 3. Next we need to factor out the smallest power of the variable x that can be seen in the problem. In this case, it will be . Our GCF is      Factor out the GCF by dividing it into each term.                        3: Factor the following problem completely    Find the greatest factor common to every term. Since the last term, 24, does not contain any variables, no variables are common in this problem and only the -6 may be factored out.   -6   Factor out the GCF by dividing it into each term
RjhlypQWaa	Does the (2) mean you need two answers?  1. a quadratic expression is any expression that refers to an equation that's greatest power is to the power of 2. (aka x^2)    2. X^2 or X^2+2x+4    3. y=2x+3 (it's a line: in the y=mx+b form) or x^2+y^2=16 (it's a circle).    4. y= sinx is a wave function.    5. factorize  just means that you are completely factoring an expression. So that none of the terms have any shared terms anymore.    6. not exactly sure what that means. You can factor qudractics using the quadratic equation or reverse foil, and you can also factor common multiples, or reverse distribution.    7. a quadratic equation is an equation that expresses the graph of a parabola with the greatest power being 2.    8. an expression is a phrase and an equation is an.. equation.  ex: equation: x^2, expression:on the first day she had 2 pennies, on the second day she had 4, and on the 3rd day she had 8. each day is the previous day times 2.    9. general form is always ax^2+bx+c  where a,b and c are integer variables.|`|RShYFxA9aa	Just to get you started; the site below is very helpful for an algebra student      1.

It also depends how they view you.|`|AREAqfSJaa	i don't want to scare you, but yes. it is true. there are a lot of mean spirited kids in these schools that will give you sh*t for no reason.    but there are an equal number of nice kids and every one eventually finds their place.    there was this kid my 2nd  year in high school, his name was Toshi some thing or other.    he was a Japanese foreign exchange student. and he REALLY stood out. he wore shiny leather lofers and wierd shorts and he shaved his legs and had really long finger nails and wore a little white scarf around him.     i personally was nice to him, and i saw a lot of other people being nice to him. and i actually never saw any thing but niceness being thrown his way.    so you probably have nothing to worry about :) but im from oregon, and this is a pretty mellow state. if you go into a bigger city high school, i  bet it would be a little worse >.>    what state are you moving to?    GOOD LUCK :D|`|95NYsIXUaa	No|`|kzgmFekKaa	I wouldn't know about the US but the best thing is to not worry about moving to another school, and just be nice and kind to everyone, and treat them all equally.

But that's just one school in an entire U.S., so since I haven't been to too many schools I really cannot answer that question correctly. It all depends on the school. I'm sure you will have better luck in a bigger school than in a smaller one. But for the most part, I have seen that most kids like the new kid because he/she's new and it's something different. So I would say you will probably be ok. Try not to work yourself up into a nervous frenzy, and you'll be just fine.|`|5zqfDEXZaa	it depends what kind of kids you like and if you let them get to you kids feed on the weak remember that|`|7kvTHzj0aa	it depends on where in the US you are moving.

Mean girls are easy to spot, so stay invisible to them.  American high schools are usually so crowded there will be kids enough to choose from.  Stick to the ones that remind you of yourself, not the ones who appear most popular. "Popular" is usually a misnomer for "dominant" when you're in high school, and dominance requires some ugly, selfish, dirty competitive personality traits.  If all else fails, many states allow students to transfer to a local school of their choice.  My niece transfered twice in her first year, and has been happily at her present school since.  Hang in and try first, though, as the nice kids are often a little shyer to introduce themselve s at first than the mean ones.  E.

For example:  My name is Gerry, so I will give you an example.    Hi, my name is Gerry, 21, of Upstate New York."     The "21" after my name represents my age, and I stated my location.  All with very few words. And then you can write more about you to get the rest of your introduction more exciting.    If I were to write it this way then it would be too many small words and would sound a bit boring.      Hi, my name is Gerry, my age is 21 and I live in Upstate New York.     If your name is Billie, then do something like this.    Hello, my name is Billie, 18, originally from __________.    Hello, my name is Billie, 18, of _________ (City/State).    Or you can do one without your age and start simple:    "Hello! My name is Billie, and a little bit about me...." (and go from here...)

I think it was the stress of applying to uni even though I didn't know what I wanted to do and taking January modules at the same time.    I did not get into the university I applied to which I think turned out to be a good thing, I am on my gap year now. I am working for 6 months to save up for travelling, then I will travel for the next 6 months. I am very happy at the moment and have reapplied for a different course at different unis this year, which I am excited about. The course is not in any way related to any of my A-levels but I dont think that matters as much as people suggest.    The year out has given me more time to mature and decide what I really want to do, instead of trying to impress teachers/parents.    So for me, working throuhg it and getting OK A-level results, not brilliant but enough to get into mid-range universities, then taking a year out was the right choice.    I know a few friends who dropped out of A-levels to either become apprentises or do a diploma style college course and it seems to have worked out very well for them.|`|sA3ae7eQaa	well i am planning to have a year out and go travelling and get a job. then go you uni or college. this way you are more grown up for uni/college and you have experience and sometime you find a job you love and dont need to go to college.|`|IIC9e3JQaa	what do you want to do? are there subjects you actually want to study?     also, what is it that you're not enjoying? it may be worth finishing the courses to have the education and qualifications under your belt; then you'll be in a better position to look at what you want to do next, whether it be go to uni, further education at college (eg a practical course), or get a job

It's ranked amongst the best.       EDIT- As if yaar! You get a guranteed job if your an IIT'ian! Owing to the autonomy of the IITs, these institutes are among those few institutes (the other institutes being NITs) in India that offer degrees in technology (B.

The IITs receive disproportionately high grants compared to other engineering colleges in India.     The Times Higher Education Supplement (2008) ranked IIT-Delhi and IIT-Bombay 157th and 174 th best overall universities respectively in their World University Rankings. The THES also ranked 5 IITs in the top 100 globally for technology with IIT-Bombay ranking the highest at 36th.

And how about parents that make excuses for their kids and don't teach them how to be responsible for themselves?    There is no singular cause of the educational problem in the US.

fAcVndo7aa	Let's call the numbers x, y, and z. X is the first number, y the second, and z is the third.    We know that the mean is 25 - meaning, if you add the three together and divide by 3, you get 25.  You can write it like this:  (x+y+z)  ------------ = 25      3    We also know that the second number, which we called y, is four less than twice the first.  You can write that like this:  y=2x-4    The third number is two more than four times the first.  You can write that like this:  z=4x+2    Once you have those, you have what you need to solve the equation.  You can substitute the "x" equations for y and z, like this:  x+(2x-4)+(4x+2)  ------------------------  = 25           3    Then you can solve for x.|`|uIqqC1Kaaa	The mean of three numbers is 25. Express that mathematically.  Let's say the numbers are a, b, c, (a being first, b second...)  the mean= (a+b+c)/3=25, therefore, their sum is equal to 75.      The second number is four less than twice the first:  b=2a-4    The third number is two more than four times the first:  c=2+4a    Now that we have b, c in terms of a,plug it back in to:  a+b+c=75  now equals:  a+2a-4+2+4a=75  =7a-2=75  7a=77  a=11    a is intuitively the smallest number, but work out the other ones to make sure:  b=2a-4=2(11)-4=22-4=  18    c=2+4a=2+4(11)=  46    To check:  (11+18+46)/3=?25  75/3=25  25=25|`|ZUKz3XDvaa	The mean is the arithmetic average of a set of numbers.  You find the mean by adding all of the numbers together and dividing by the number of numbers.  Sound confusing?  It's not that hard.    You have three numbers, and you don't know what they are, so they are variables.  Call them a, b and c.  A will be the first number, B the second, C the third.    The mean of {a, b and c} is found by adding them together and dividing by three, because there are three numbers in the set.    That gives us our first equation:    (a + b + c)/3 = 25     multiple both sides of the equation by three and you get:    a + b + c = 75      Moving on: "The second number is four less than twice the first."    The second number (b) is 4 less than twice the first (a).    b = 2a -4    The third number (c) is two more than four times the first.    c = 2 + 4a    That's great.  We have b in terms of a and c in terms of a so we can solve for one of the variables.    a + b + c = 75  b = 2a -4  c = 2 + 4a      before we solve for a though, we're solving for the smallest number, right.  So, let's look at what we've found.  Looking at the equations for b and c, you know that c is bigger than b and definitely bigger than a, so c isn't the smallest number.    Why do we know this?  Because a can't be a negative number because then b and c (which are multiples of a) would also likely be negative numbers (b would be, c might be depending on what a was).  There's no way that a + b + c would equal 75.    So the only question is whether or not a is a small enough number that if you double it and subtract 4 you get a smaller number than what you started with.   If a is 1, but would be -3 and the smallest number.  If a is 2, b would be 0 and the smallest number.  If a is 3, be would 2 and the smallest number.  If a is 4, b would be 4 also and they'd both be the smallest number, and since your question is asking for a sole answer, it's probably not that.  But just by looking at the equations you can see that unless a is one of these few numbers, a is the smallest number.   You can also look at those equations and figure out pretty easily (since b and c are both determined as multiples of a) that there's no way a + b + c is going to add up to 75 if a is such a small number.  Even assuming that a (and therefore b) is 4, c then has to be 67.  If a is 4, c is only 20.  Without ever doing the actual plugging in, the math, just writing out the equations, you can look and determine which one is the smallest.     a + b + c = 75    now sub-in    a + (2a -4) + (2 +4a)=75    do the arithmetic    7a - 2 = 75  7a = 77  a=11    you knew in advance by looking at the equations that a was going to be the smallest number, so you don't have to solve for b or c.  but solving for them and plugging them back into your initial equation is a great way to double check your work, especially since even if you have something down cold, people often make mistakes in the little places, like basic adding and subtracting and they'll remake those same mistakes when double-checking their work.  if you can double-check your work by an alternate path, one that your brain hasn't done before, that's always the best choice    b = 2a -4  b = 2(11) -4  b = 18    c = 2 + 4a  c = 2 + 4(11)  c= 46    a + b + c = 75    11 + 18 + 46 = 75    perfect!    the mean of 11, 18 and 46 is in fact, 25

AA10067221	I would choose a controversial topic that is closely connected to your particular age group or generation.  Here are a few examples:    __1. -Cyber-bullying: (cyberbullying is defined as "willful and repeated harm inflicted through the use of computers, cell phones, and other electronic devices.")  Cyber-bullying has grown as a means of threatening, intimidating or harassing others over the past several years. It can take many forms, including posting private or embarrassing photos of someone, developing websites to rate peoples appearance, creating hateful blogs about someone, stealing electronic passwords, or spreading lies.   This controversial issue explores the arguments of censorship, the freedom of speech, the definition of 'willful harm/harassment' and about whose responsibility it is, either the parents, teens, internet police, etc., to protect young on-line users from cyberbullying.  http://www.cyberbullying.us/index.php    __2. -The Pursuit of Perfection: This controversy is regarding the amount of pressure parents, schools, the media, and peers put on teens to be "perfect," successful, beautiful, etc.   In addition to the potential for individual harm, there is an absolutely certain cultural harm related to the mass pursuit and glorification of physical perfection. In her 1992 bestseller, The Beauty Myth, Naomi Wolf describes a $33 billion "thinness industry", a $20 billion "youth industry", and a $300 million "cosmetic surgery industry" and admonishes the commercial forces propelling women towards never ending external improvements. The marketing of plastic surgery to a younger and younger clientele only intensifies a conspiracy that requires women to be evaluated by homogenized perceptions of beauty instead of more integrated and realistic virtues. Why would any of us want to live in a world that requires all of us from 14-year-olds to 50-year-olds  to have Britney Spears' breasts, Reese Whiterspoon's nose and a 4-year-olds' crease free forehead? All women are the losers in this game and we are already in the fifth inning if 20-somethings are scheduling Botox injections and teens are requesting painful surgical procedures as presents.   http://www.jewishworldreview.com/0205/ma...    __3. -School Burn-Out: This controversial issue is concerning the amount of school-related activities and requirements teens face now in high school & how that often leads to "school burn-out." Faced with an unlimited amount of choices combined with the pressure of a fast-paced-world, teens are spreading their selves too thin by engaging in a number of commitments.  Besides physical, mental, and emotional exhaustion, there are several more pressing consequences of school burn-out.    __4. -To Work or Not To Work: The topic of high school employment is often an overlooked conflict young people face, but nevertheless, a controversial issue. This issue debates why it is either acceptable or not acceptable for teens to have jobs during their high school years. Many teens disregard the benefits of choosing academics over employment and become less focused in their pursuit of an education, while some teens are forced to work in order to provide for themselves and their families.    If you are looking for popular controversial issues, here are some topics that currently receive a lot of attention:    __1. Violence in the Media  -Many parents, lawmakers, and researchers believe that violent movies, television programs, music, and video games contribute to the high rates of violence in American society. Debate the issue with the following topics as one of the above informed speakers: How Serious Is the Problem of Violence in the Media? Does Violence in the Media Make Children and Teenages More Violent?  __2. Controversies in the Practice of Medicine  -Explore these topics as someone who practices medicine: Beginning of life issues -- National health insurance -- Medical marijuana -- Healing prayers -- Mind-body connection -- Human cloning, genetic engineering -- Condom distribution in schools -- Organ donation -- Childhood vaccinations -- Animal testing/experimentation.  __3. Espionage and Intelligence Gathering  -Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the United States has reevaluated its intelligence-gathering agencies and implemented new national security measures. Examine the methods of intelligence gathering and their effectiveness, debate the threat to civil liberties, and explore the future of espionage and intelligence gathering.  __4. Genetic Engineering  -From genetically modified foods to human cloning, aspects of genetic engineering (modifying genes of living things in the laboratory) stir up strong feelings and lively debate. Present overviews and pro and con viewpoints on such subjects as genetic engineering in agriculture, engineering of human genes, and regulation of genetic engineering.    Good Luck with your speech...and, nice job on getting an early start.|`|be025e8eec4977bf6cdb9fb6f0765797aa	1) Why do women talk so much?  You can talk about the difference between the male and female brain, how the connectivity differs in order that women process multiple things whereas men have 'one track minds.' It's a slightly controversial yet funny topic, which I did for my speech competition. It got me into the finals (I hate speaking in public so yeah...that was good for me!)    2) Should we include aspects of Islamic law in our legal system?   In a multicultural society, should we be looking at including other types of laws into our system? Why should our system only be based on the Christian ethos? Controversial, and you don't have to just use Islam but Judaism, Hinduism etc.    3) Should same sex couples be allowed to adopt children? What effects could this have on the child and on the parents? Does society have the right to choose who will or won't be a good parent based on their sexuality?    4) Should holocaust deniers be allowed to voice their opinions? This, of course, comes under the whole notion of freedom of speech and expression. You could do anything for this-the Bill Henson photographs-is it art or pornography? Remarks by certain Islamic clerics about women-should they be stopped or openly debated? What pros and cons are there for allowing people total expression/repressing speech?    5) Should we abandon the idea of states and concentrate our political system within a central government? Maybe a bit dull and not so controversial...but no-one else would do it :)    6) With the 'problems' surrounding children and child protection today, should parents be made to undergo compulsory parenting classes before having children? Should people be given a 'license' to breed? LOL     7) Should creationism be taught in schools? An oldie but a goodie.    8) Should organ and blood donation be made compulsory for all citizens? Would it be better to adapt an adopt-out system rather than the adopt-in that we have for the moment.    Erm...that's all I can think of at the moment. I need food for my brain :) Hope this helps!!|`|A93KIkWTaa	I personally think that your topic should be about something that is on going. I suggest something like, the current economic crisis.

The grammatically best thing to say is: Didn't you go out today?|`|WoEsehoRaa	Did you go out today?|`|df20f780e29b5cda4abf6f0d9f61d5baaa	Never means never and usually isn't restricted by a lesser qualifier, like today.       But maybe if you are fighting about this, you need to be seeking relationship help.|`|e739a2c4e1e2dcb4dfddc6736311a5ceaa	Sounds good to me. Remember, in conversational usage, 'clipped' speech is common and acceptable. "Clipped' speech is when words are not used because they are understood from the context of the conversation. That's what's happening here. He could have said 'Did you not go out today?' That's six words - he used four to convey the same message.    That's really pretty common in spoken English. It would not be acceptable in formal written English, but conversationally, it's fine.|`|YcGNL9y1aa	I am not going out today or I haven't been out today or you are not going out today or you didn't go out today.    So, I guess you are right!|`|AA10418744	You were right.   other possibilities:    you never went out today?|`|7428c2399ac39bb8006f047995493c49aa	You are correct. "You didn't go out today?" or "Didn't you go out today?" - either one is correct.  "Never go out today?" is wrong, wrong, wrong.  .|`|tMK9abumaa	He is wrong.
W8F9PboZaa	Seriously absolutely nothing. You don't even get asked anything specifically from year 11. The questions that are asked are based on the year 12 syllabus.     However for certain subjects you need to know the stuff taught in earlier years in order to do the harder stuff. ie maths, that's the only main one. Like you'll need to know how to use pythagoras' theorem and how to do basic algebra so that you can build on the more complex stuff.  English is also kinda related. Only because if you don't do anything from years 7-10 your english skills won't be fantastic and you're not going to have the ability to write an essay.  Maybe science a little bit. But probably not. I did biology for years 11 and 12 and chemistry for year 11 and you just get taught everything from scratch. My teacher pretty much assumed we knew nothing.    But subjects like histories and stuff, year 12 is entirely new stuff. People from every school do different topics in year 11 so they have to have an entirely separated syllabus so as to not give some a disadvantage.    But yeah seriously don't worry about it at all.

FmYkUfIDaa	Hi Kyoya Hibari,    This is one of the problems in understanding 'English written communication.'    A commonsense analysis of the statement could indicate that each classroom is equipped with computers (plural).   The tricky bit relates to the projectors!    Question: Why would you need more than one projector in a classroom.    The only possibility I can think of is - as a spare?    If the statement read - "All classrooms are equipped with a computer for each student and one projector per room." That would have made the message easier to understand.    It just shows that when we communicate in writing, we need to be careful that the intent of our message is not obscure or prone to misinterpretation.|`|GxeanV5faa	more than one classroom have more than one computer and projector|`|fKOVtNLVaa	Well that depends.... are you going to a computer lab?

Him being home schooled has nothing to do with that.  He is just that way.  For that teacher to behave that way is scary. I have been to the school board on several occasions to address some serious issues my daughter has been having and nothing got rectified so I pulled her out of school and transferred her to another local school. That was very unprofessional of her of that teacher who told you that.  In my experience, going to a teacher or principal is worthless. Principals are always going to be on the teachers side. Go higher. School Board and talk to the superintendent. Schools will know it's serious when the super gets involved. In my case, it worked for a period of time but again, nothing really was changed after that but hopefully it will in your case.|`|E4iUcYEjaa	What kind of teacher did you speak too?

J4lfOSPiaa	Hey Julian,  I answered another of your questions before I saw this one. Listen to me and this is something I have had a lot of experience with- when you are the new kid on the block it is tough finding your fit with your classmates.  Julian it does not totally reflect on your Aspergers!  My folks moved around a lot and I was always being thrust into a new school system.  It would not make any difference if I had Asperger or if I was an alien from a different planet because younger school age friendships are just hard to walk into so I decided, okay they can either like me for who I am or eventually I will have nothing but a hurt set of feelings if I walk up to people, introduce myself, and tell them I am new to the school.  Then get them to strike up a conversation by asking which teachers they like or what lunch meals to avoid.... Julian I know you are a smart guy and you are going to figure this out.  Don't beat yourself up because the whole 149 other classmates did not catch on to what a great mind you have. Hey, buddy, you got 1 and that is all it takes.  Keep me updated, please.|`|tU5NJVL3aa	You are the same person that you were before the diagnoses.  Just be yourself and I bet it will all turn out just fine.      By the way, I'm an aerospace engineer -- did you know that a large number of people in the engineering professions also have Asperger to some degree or other?  Focus on your studies and you will probably be on your way to a solid and good paying career.      Hang in there!
J4lfOSPiaa	Hey Julian, how do you feel about attending a new school?  Statistically speaking it would be hard "not" to find a school that did not have young folks with the conditions you listed. You are correct that the start of a good friendship should not be all about a condition.  You are smart and could probably write a book about symptoms all by yourself.  Just be laid back and make friends with a lot of people- I know it can be scary to start a new school and finding people with similar syndromes can make you feel comforted like you fit in better, but Julian life has a special way of sometimes opening up your world to all kinds of experiences and friendships. Just remember that the disease does not define who you are and how unique you are- True you were born with things some of us in the community don't fully understand because we don't have Aspergers, but think of the special perspective you experience every day and one day somebody will walk up to you and say Hey,Julian, I have this syndrome and I feel like very few people understand me.  On that day Julian you are going to hold so much information in that actively seeking mind of yours that your new friend will have to buy a tape recorder to keep up with you. :) That was me smiling with you Julian. You are going to do fine and soon you will be buddied up with so many friends you will lose count. Hey, from all of us in the community who love you just remember many of us don't have these syndromes  but we are proud to call you our friend! Good luck my man- you will do just fine.|`|R8tLpFm1aa	You can't tell just by looking at something whether they have OCD or Asperger's.  But why on earth would you want to make friends with someone based only on that?  You should try to make new friends based on common interests and hobbies, regardless of whether or not they have any kind of disorder.

A lot of people wait till drop/add to register, so if it's a popular class chances are the seat has been filled.    The same thing happened to me, it's so frustrating.

Mf6PV2v3aa	This means that 1 is the neutral number for the operation /. This operation is not true for a = 0, since a division by 0 isn't possible.    Ok let me clarify, since my answer was fast, and you seem to have anger management problems.    The division operator (/) is not really an operator, but a composition law. It multiplies a number with the invert of the second.    Thus : a / a = a * a^(-1). By definition, multiplying a number by its invert gives you the neutral number, also called the identity number, which is 1 for the multiplication.    Now, calling that a property for the division operation is a bit over-rated, and that's probably why you don't have clearer answers.    You can't call that : a/a = 1 a property. I told you what you can say in my previous edit :-) I'm sure of my answer. Now is the end of my attempts to make you understand.

74f5e4e698a7718dfb254fa5418f938baa	Amira gave the answer that I was thinking.  I recommend renting a copy of the movie Romeo & Juliet that stars Leo DiCaprio & Claire Danes.  It has the original Shakespearean speak, but the visuals are more up-to-date than some of the older versions.  You can see how the characters are feeling and understand more of what they are trying to say by watching their body language and their movements.

It might even be a movie for your class to see.|`|WaV6HsVFaa	Unless you have the play with you, I can't help you. If you do, yay!

uIqqC1Kaaa	There are many ways to approach this problem. What I did was:  take the second equation {x+5y-z=8} and solve for z:    z=x+5y-8    Then plug in the z-value into the first equation:    3x+4y+(x+5y-8)=14  which yields:    4x+9y=22    Then take equations 2 and 3. Multiply both sides of the third equation by 5 to get:   10x-5y+10z=30    Then add this equation to equation 2:     (x+  5y    -z=8)  +(10x-5y+10z=30)  =11x+9z=38    Now take equation 3 and solve for x:  2x=6+y-2z ==> x=3+.5y-z    Then plug in this x-value into equation 1:    3(3+.5y-z)+4y+z=14  to get: 9+1.5y-3z+4y+z=14  rewritten: 5.5y-2z=5    Now you have 3 equations, but each one has only 2 variables...  4x+9y=22  11x+9z=38  11y-4z=10    Now comes the dirty arithmetic...  take one equation, solve for a variable (maybe x),  the plug the variable into another equation with the said variable (x)  Then you will get one equation with only one variable, which can be solved.

XOnSRoR2aa	I think it will be very challenging for you considering how absolutely miserable the economy is right now, but there are some great art schools here, and if this is where you want to be then you should pursue it.     It would be awesome if you could work at an art store like Blick's, Blue Rooster, or Ghettogloss where you would probably get a discount on supplies and meet other artists, so I would start by checking in with them and asking if they are hiring. Ask for suggestions of other places to try if they aren't hiring. Also look into jobs at the Bergamont Station. Jobs are very scarce right now, but I think you would have a better chance of landing one that is related to your interests.     You might also want to consider nannying. Depending upon the family and your experience working with kids, you can do fairly well. When my parents were looking for a nanny to help out with my younger siblings a few years ago I was a bit stunned by how much they got paid, actually. They used the Elizabeth Rose Agency.     Your school may also have a site with classifieds for jobs and housing that you could check out.     I have a few friends going to art schools here, and they are happy, but most still live at home so that makes it a lot easier. Try to see if you can find a good roommate and an affordable place to live, and that will help with the stress.     Good luck out here!|`|LLq9uPi4aa	Housing costs are high.  A minimum wage job isn't that hard to come by, and there are a lot of jobs for babysitting/things like that, but it's harder to find a low skill decent wage job.  You should contact your college and see if they have student jobs.  They are usually really flexible around your school schedule and pay a little better.  Maybe you can find something in the art store at the school or something.

Just divide. The km cancel out because it is km/km/hr and the double division means your flip it and you get km x hr/km. 14,600,000. Might want to check that though. Many zeros.
UxooffHZaa	I think people put too much emphasis on where you graduate from instead of how well you do, and what courses you take during your studies. So, I say, go to a smaller state university (with easier admissions), do a good Internship at a large, well known library, and you'll find employment when you graduate.

JliwUfVCaa	standard deviation just tells you how much the data values vary.  If some data values are really high, while some are really low, the standard deviation will be high, because the data values are spread out so much.  That's why the standard deviation can be higher than the mean.  A really high standard deviation of payouts at a casino means that the average number of winnings isn't that reliable, because the different payouts differ so greatly.
AA10067221	For one thing, Gatsby is amoral in many ways. First, he is a crook, a bootlegger who has involved himself with swindlers like Meyer Wolfshime, "the man who fixed the World Series back in 1919." Secondly, he is dishonest, because he tells lies about himself. "I am the son of some wealthy people in the middle-west-all dead now. I was brought up in America but educated at Oxford because all my ancestors have been educated there for many years. It is a family tradition."  Lastly, he spends his money recklessly.

(Of course he did lie to Daisy and say he was from a wealthy family but he he changed from what Daisy knew him)  -Lying about his past to attain the American Dream  -Living in the past and not the present (He constantly thinks Daisy still loves him)    If I think of any others I will put them up

Of course, we all realize it is an off-shoot of the verb "to build," but it is most likely just an interesting colloquial coincidence of modern English that a verb and noun share.

Not to mention you get to interact with both male and female. I would never send my kids to an all girls school or an all boys school. Public schools can be crowded though, and more problems tend to hit public schools - Like, you get kids with learning and behavioural issues in public schools a lot more than you do in a private school. And there's also the issue with smoking etc on school grounds - If kids did that even once in a private school they'd be gone in a second. But because its a public school, I don't think they're actually allowed to say "No you can't come to this school." So.... I'm not really sure what exactly your looking for but I'm just listing everything I can think of on the subject.    Umm.... I think (I may just be stereotyping) that kids who go to private schools also tend to be a little more 'snobbish'. Some tend to look down their nose and think "I go to a better school than them, so I must be better". And it compares lifestyles. A family that doesn't have much money has to send their kids to a public school just so their kids can recieve an education, but a family with money to burn can send their kids to a $2000 a week private school, and that can make them feel superior over others. It's not a good environment.     I hope I helped in some way. Good luck with your debate.

Mobiles are a good way for kids to have their own independence and it is a brilliant way to make sure they can always be in contact with you in case something is wrong or something. The decision is totally up to you but maybe you should talk to some parents who have kids the same age and see what their views are on it.|`|lSL6BdX6aa	I think between 11 and 13 would be an appropriot age.

We gave our son a mobile for Christmas 2007 as he was starting High School in 2008. He had to get a train to school in the morning and a train and bus home in the afternoon ( by himself).He had never done this before ( travelled alone) so we got him a BASIC phone with a "top-up" feature ( i.e. $20 worth of calls). It was purely a safety thing in case he missed the bus/ train or caught the wrong one. I think very few of his friends have mobiles ( even though he goes to a private school). We've impressed upon him that it's an appliance - not a toy. My advice is to buy one IF it's for safety. Should you really want to get one - then buy a basic one with the idea that he can only have $X worth of calls so you don't get a huge bill. Incidentally, I've just realised that you put mobile first and not cell so maybe you're not American either!|`|AjqO1aJgaa	When they need one for some reason other than "because everyone else has one".    I'd be wary of "he doesn't need one because everyone else has one", though. If you're relying on there being a mobile phone owned by a child, then your child needs to be the child you are relying on.|`|LwywrSRkaa	I was 14 when I had mine, and I think it was appropriate. =) I was also the last one to have a phone. I know how to use it appropriately. I seriously can't believe how little kids as old as 7 or younger get mobile phones, it is absolutely ridiculous if you ask me. And what about times when kids record people getting bullied, fights and so on? My point is if they know how to use it sensibly then they can have one but need to be old enough to understand so. Oh and texting people a lot of the time can seriously waste your money. And I don't see the point of people changing their phone every month just to be like the trend...    Oh and for safety? Yes, but why on earth do you need it on during school? Phones get taken away all the time at my school if used inappropriately. For emergencies parents should call the school right? There is so much to consider, like internet safety, crimes etc. etc. Trust me 10 year olds can be a pain!|`|530fc5625af617fef3f442bfdc20f598aa	My son was given basic phone when he was old enough to play out and be out of sight for a short while. He was 8 years old. This was purely for safety issues. You cannot and should not depend on his friends for their phones. I can call my son wherever he is and I know he can call me. I feel his safety is paramount and I am so much more at ease being able to speak to him wherever he is. He is not allowed out without his phone, he is now 12.|`|lgXSmCQRaa	Great question. I would not personally give a phone to anyone under 14. Actually I would prefer that they waited until about 17 but that's just not realistic. Currently because the usage of mobiles has blown up in the last 10 years we have not been able to fully understand the effects of the this technology. Many believe that within the next 10-15 years scientist will say that it is not safe to use them.     My sister got one a few months ago which I wasnt happy about, she is 13, if the child is still collected from school they shouldnt require one so much but if they are not its piece of mind to just get them one. But what I would suggest you do is limit the usage of it, younger people are more susceptible to the dangers of new technologies this goes for laptops, ipods and all the rest. I would prefer that my sister didnt use them. I was 17 when I got my first phone and I am glad because these companies do not care who they harm, protect your little one!|`|QNObnVODaa	When he can afford to buy it,and pay the bills for himself!

Pharmacists usually have to deal with the general public in a retail setting, and usually have to work nights and weekends. I don't think pharmacists have to take their work home with them, though.    2) I would say both careers very roughly have the same starting income. Law has the *potential* to be extremely lucrative, depending on what kind of law and what kinds of clients you work for.    3) Law traditionally has the most prestige, usually considered equally prestigious as medicine. But pharmacy is still looked upon quite well by most.    4) Supposedly, there is a glut of law graduates right now, so it can be hard to find work. On the other hand, pharmacy graduates are relatively rarer, so combined with an aging population, pharmacy looks like it has a better long term outlook.    5) That all depends on your interests.|`|p3JGYWrBaa	I say lawyer too, but that depends on what kind of lawyer you want to be.|`|NDKRgPCnaa	Why the hell would you become a pharmacist?

2VNmxfgpaa	Do not just rework the sentences  thats called careless plagiarism.  The only way around it is to think critically about what the sentences say, and write your own paragraph, in your own words.  Your own words are important!  You have a unique voice that is recognizable by a teacher.      I will give you an example of the kind of result you might get:    "St. Pierre and Miquelon have little international reputation, but are notorious in French and Canadian diplomatic circles due to many territorial disagreements.  Since (date), France and Canada have politically controlled these islands in (what way).  Frances fishing industry has benefited from proximity to these islands.  However, Canada has argued that they are within rights to share these benefits.  Because travel is not yet commercialized on these islands, they make for a unique destination."    Do not use actual words from the sentences.  Find different ones.  Use the thesaurus in your word processor.      There is an easy key to doing this.      1. Read the passage.  2. Second, look away from it and ask yourself "what are they telling me?"  3. Third, and here's the great part: the answer to "what they are telling you" comes to you *in your own words*, in the process of *describing to yourself what you have just read*.  There, you found your own voice!  You might even say to yourself, *I can think of a better way to express that*.  4. Cite your source and show you did your research!  You can always quote a source directly if you cite it!      Good luck!|`|K8LHoYruaa	1.  Not only does this very small French territory have a colourful history, but it remains familiar to Canadians and French alike.    2.

That line inspired me to finally take the backpacking trip through Europe that I had been putting off for years.    It was the best decision I've ever made.  I had the time of my life, and on my last day there, I met the woman who would become my wife.
FmYkUfIDaa	People could take a lesson from the animals with respect to relationships, so here's my answer:    It means that they live together for the rest of their lives - only death will part them.    Swans also Mate for Life and the same is true for many more of natures beautiful creatures.    Isn't it curious, they have the wings to fly away from each other, yet they don't!    Of course many people Mate for Life; at least they promise to, however, for various reasons, these relationships Quack-Up. Sorry, I just couldn't resist it.|`|SEXRn1R3aa	It means that they don't stray from one another. They're like a couple forever in a monogamous relationship.

In real life, commutative would be saying that you can put 2 marbles in a jar and then 3 marbles in a jar, and would have the same result if you put 3 marbles in a different jar, and then 2 marbles in after it.    Distributive in real life: Three envelopes can be mailed using three 24c stamps and three 17c stamps, one of each on each envelope. What would you need if you just used one stamp on each envelope instead of two?    3(24 + 17) = 3(41)    three 41c stamps    PS You look cute, judging by your profile picture.

y39iNwFjaa	Accountant  Teacher    Personally, I'd consider doinga  degree in maths and then considering your options. Google career options for maths (for instance) and you'll come up with this type of info:  Career Opportunities  What sort of careers are there in mathematics and statistics?  This is a question many students ask. A quick glance at the 'Situations Vacant' section of Saturday's Press is enough to see that there are few, if any, relevant jobs listed under MATHEMATICS or STATISTICS. A more in-depth look will reveal that mathematics and statistics graduates are employed in many different areas. Industry, commerce, government departments and teaching represent some of the more obvious ones. Some jobs require specific mathematical or statistical skills while others, although not directly involving these skills, require the ability to think precisely and reason logically; these are abilities gained from your mathematical studies.    Generally business, industry and government want people who have a broad background and interest in a variety of mathematical areas, computation and science. Therefore you need to take papers that will expand your knowledge of applications of mathematics and statistics. The most directly applicable papers would be in biology, economics, engineering, physics, accounting, management and computer science. In particular, there are very good job opportunities in financial mathematics and in computing combined with mathematics.    Employers in both private and government sectors are increasingly seeking top graduates from a general field, sometimes not specifying any particular discipline at all. They want bright people whom they will train. Also, the need for people who have a working knowledge of statistics has burgeoned in recent years.    You could also consider banking (Argh!) or local government who take apprentices at 16 + if you don't want to do a degree.|`|PD3qATQtaa	With those subjects you will really have a wide range of course to choose from at University. As I starting point I would start looking at the courses on offer and find anything that interests you from the the associated careers.|`|HEQc83d9aa	Bank manager.
hyHvG1Olaa	There are individuals who have a Ed. D. in Early Child Development who teach Kindergarten, albeit in a University Laboratory School.  To teach in a public school system you will need a minimum of a bachelor's degree.  Many states are moving to require a master's degree and no state, to the best of my knowledge, requires a doctorate.  Additionally, although many school districts provide additional money for those individuals who hold the higher degree this is not always the case.  Many school districts do not pay more for a Ph. D. or Ed. D. and the amount for a master's over a doctorate can be as low as $200 a year to a high of around $3,000 a year or more.    Here is the breakdown for degrees ... Associate - 2 years, Bachelor - average 4-5 years, Master - 2 years past Bachelor, and Doctorate is between 4 - 9 years past one's Master's degree.

2VNmxfgpaa	Describe examples of your qualities and strong feelings.  Your solid reputation at work, the fact that you graduated at the top of (one or more classes), your spare time as a support group facilitator will tell the evaluators what they need to know.    Put yourself in their shoes:  in order to keep their program going, they must choose the people who have the *best chance of success*.  Therefore, you must prove to them that your chances are soaring.  Your dedication to X means that you have the determination.  Your academic accomplishment (pick a good one) means that you will achieve good grades and make their program look good.  Your contribution to community projects means that you really do enjoy helping people.      Do not summarize by saying you would, might, or feel. "I feel a career as a nursing assistant would be" is less than certain.  "The program is the perfect way for me to pursue my long-time goal of entering into the field of nursing.  My goal ultimately is to continue my education..." See what I mean?  Show them that A) you have demonstrated in the past that you have *what it takes* to handle the rigors B) you are not toying with the idea, you are determined, this is your all-time goal.    Lastly but most importantly:  type into Microsoft word, and make sure your language is flawless and error free.  First, list your examples and conclusion (A) and (B).  Then, make definite, well-stated sentences, to the point and brief.  Brief conveys certainty.  Finally, make a short paragraph free from all error.    Good luck!  The fact that you care enough to post means you are one of the 11 - you will get in and start a great career.

Maybe you could give some examples of things you have done to illustrate these points (like volunteer work or doing something special with children, the elderly, people in need).  As a nursing assistant you would be dealing with people of all ages and from all walks of life who are perhaps at their most vulnerable, really needing a lot of (qualified) tender loving care.  In any case, be honest, be yourself.  Good luck!   The world needs more caring people.|`|3I2H3wMAaa	Good question. That question is a dreaded one.    Well, first of all be honest.     Second of all tell them what you just said.     Thirdly. Believe what you tell them from your heart of hearts.    Be real, be passionate. Operate from your HEART, not what "sounds good". That alone will set you apart as unique and exceptional. Always operate from the mindset of what you want to do for THEM.    There you go!    Go forth and accept your new job!.

Your future is determined by what you do, if you look back at the end of your life and think, "I wish I'd done that", then you have only yourself to blame. If you and Marcus aren't together in the future, you will really regret not going to the better Uni because of a past boyfriend. Anglia Ruskin is crap by the way! I'd go to Kent and make a go of your life. If your relationship is meant to be, it'll still be there when you get back. Do what's right for you.

There's the argument that our society gets its moral grounding from religion, but research suggests groups of humans have always had moral codes. They seem to be innate in us. There are also many who say that Jesus helped them give up the booze, get back on track with their lives, etc. Religious groups are also often tied to charity organizations.    As for a few of the cons: it's scientifically unverifiable - and in fact often completely contradicted by science and history, it can cause sectarian violence and intolerance, it can persuade people to uphold ancient "moral" codes that are now thought to be incorrect or hateful (anti-homosexuality, genital mutilation, etc.) religious fundamentalists often seek to impose their beliefs on others (Islamic law, creationism in schools) and it has fairly consistently shot down progress - social and scientific - by proclaiming them both as blasphemy.

Romeo's age is not specified in the Shakespeare play.|`|NNiN0tK0aa	She's just coming up to her 14th birthday.|`|baDTO1Vqaa	Romeo and Juliet is a tragedy written towards the beginning of the career of playwright William Shakespeare about two teenage "star-cross'd lovers"[1] whose untimely deaths ultimately unite their feuding families. It was among Shakespeare's most popular plays during his lifetime and, along with Hamlet, is one of his most frequently performed plays. Today, the title characters are regarded as archetypal young lovers.(about 13 and 14 years).    Romeo and Juliet belongs to a tradition of tragic romances stretching back to antiquity. Its plot is based on an Italian tale, translated into verse as The Tragical History of Romeus and Juliet by Arthur Brooke in 1562, and retold in prose in Palace of Pleasure by William Painter in 1582. Shakespeare borrowed heavily from both, but developed supporting characters, particularly Mercutio and Paris, in order to expand the plot. Believed to be written between 1591 and 1595, the play was first published in a quarto version in 1597. This text was of poor quality, and later editions corrected it, bringing it more in line with Shakespeare's original text.    Shakespeare's use of dramatic structure, especially effects such as switching between comedy and tragedy to heighten tension, his expansion of minor characters, and his use of sub-plots to embellish the story, has been praised as an early sign of his dramatic skill. The play ascribes different poetic forms to different characters, sometimes changing the form as the character develops. Romeo, for example, grows more adept at the sonnet over the course of the play.

All the other options include a linking verb "was" or "were." Doing this changes the natural flow of the sentence from subject, action, object to object, action, subject.    Try to avoid this whenever possible. It is called PASSIVE voice.

No music, no TV, No headphones, no nothing.    4. Do your most difficult subject fist or else you may never get to it.    5. Keep a calendar so that you know when a project is due or a test is going to be given.    6. Vocabulary is very important. Words have different meanings. You need to know the meaning for the subject that you are taking.    7. Study the relationship of things. How is the topic that you studied related to the unit that you are studying?    8. Your textbook has hints for you. Many books have important words or phrases in darkened or colored type, make sure that you know them thoroughly.

uf9pZFlzaa	To be a teacher, you need a degree. Teaching is much more than just the ABCs - a degree in education is entirely necessary.|`|aqto0hJTaa	To teach you must learn how to teach.  You need to know how kids learn.  It's not just about knowing your ABCs.  That's pretty insulting.|`|96a57ea9f1bc612b27a5f5a92d88468faa	I understand. Even to teach english abroad they often ask for a degree in anything. I have no degree and taught english at a University in China for two years. I was accepted not only as the best english teacher but the best teacher. The degree is a status symbol for the school abroad. Here maybe its so you know your subject thoroughly so can be confident in class knowledge wise.|`|3af30c08175e2bc96bcd85540e09d175aa	There are other avenues to get into teaching. You can homeschool your own children without an education. You may be able to get a job at a preschool. You may be able to get a job as a teacher's aide. And you can write educational books or create other educational materials.    If you really want to be a classroom teacher, have you looked into Teach For America? From what I understand, if you commit to teaching at an underpriveledged school for two years, they will take care of your student loans incurred while getting your degree and teaching credential.    By the way, if "time" is important to you, you probably shouldn't pursue a career in education. Teachers have to spend a lot of time outside of class hours preparing for class, grading tests and papers, and more.|`|VjdkaeL7aa	You need to be able to account for an understanding of developmental psychology and the individual learning modes of children. Teaching is never restricted to the ABC's and even then there are a multitude of ways to teach and learn the ABC, and they are of varying degrees of effectiveness depending on both cognitive and cultural characteristics of any given child (try using a picture of an apple to teach a sudanese 4 year old the letter a for example- or teaching a child with a low emotional/musical intelligence the ABC using a song).     You also need to be able to reflect and account for how you teach and not just teach 'by ear' as this will enable to to approach your professional development logically thereby enabling you to identify what particular aspects in your teaching you can strengthen and why- just because you can successfully teach say for example, your kids the abc does not mean you can effectively teach a group of thirty of other peoples children from all walks of life and with varying degrees of aptitude the same thing.     Teaching young children is arguably even harder and requires more understanding than teaching older children as you are responsible to a large degree for a childs learning in their developmental cycle. Once you have a degree in education you will thank the Gods they didn't let you into a classroom without one- and even one is often not even enough to be an effective teacher.'    EDIT to respond to your other details.  You can assist a teacher in the classroom whilst you get a degree- that's called being a teacher's aide or a teacher's assistant- you will be working with high needs children within the classroom- the reason this job is not more common and there are not more teacher's aides is simply a matter of funding in education- there is not enough funding to pay teacher's aides to help all the student's that need them.    That being said- the direction i'd recommend for you is to approach your local schools and call your state/national public school board  explain your intention to study education and inquire as to jobs available without initial qualifications- secondly if you have an income you can get a student loan to help pay, third you can enrol in a part-time/low-cost education degree- if this is your first degree you may even qualify for some government assistance.   Good luck- the world needs good teachers.|`|hPkWZh3xaa	I thought that at one point, but having done the degree I realise it wasn't to teach me the ABCs, but the theories and methods about learning, the paperwork, the techniques etc.  No you can't do the job fully informed without one, you would go under.|`|fMbTvp4laa	to be honest i hate degrees i say experince beats anything not a piece of paper saying good job|`|QDEId9Asaa	You can do daycare, but its not teaching that is pretty much your only routes  you can teach high school if you are a college graduate with a degree, you can work and get your teaching credentials that way. while you are teaching part time    and teaching K-1 years isnt an easy job to find    The point of a degree iin teaching 5 years old is that they want to make sure that the teachers are well qualified and not just some joe schmoe     Teaching degree is an investment, just like any other job that requires a degree, you may say you cannot afford it, but there are ways to help you afford the cost of tuition.|`|F80GKhPUaa	There is much more to teaching the under 10s than you think. With the younger children teachers need to have a clear understanding of the cognitive and behavioural development of children.    Teachers in the UK try hard to receive the recognition they deserve for the demanding job they do and part of this is a rigorous and academic requirement. There are plans to make teaching a mastered profession.     Indeed, there is a need for good quality teachers and good male role models, however, don't be under any illusion about what a teacher does in school.    Some universities (Christ Church in Canterbury for example) are offering new courses where people can train on the job whilst studying for a degree, however, you need to be prepared to work extraordinarily hard.

mhFpZT3laa	There are loans yes. The school that you attend automatically considers you for all grants and scholarships, some are merit based. They will then present with you a financial aid package consisting of parent contribution, grands, and loans. The loans usually don't accumulate interest until after medical school. I really wouldn't worry about the debt that much, a physician with 100k in debt will have it paid off in a few years, if they live frugally. Other options    1) Join the military, they will pay everything in exchange for service (5 years I think, after residency)  2) Some Charitable organizations do the same, this info is available at the financial aid dept of any medical school  3) You can wait until after residency, and then cut a deal with a hospital. Many hospitals are so desperate for doctors that they will pay off some or all of your loans in exchange for a contract that dictates that you will work there for a certain number of years. The nice thing about this is you still get paid a normal wage.

Helped build character and develop self-reliance.  ? Kept them out of trouble (those .  ? Extra income for hard-pressed family.  ? Child labour was socially aceptabe even desirable to some.  ? Certain jobs couldn't be done without children (due to their size), so it was a necessary evil.  ? In keeping with Victorian & Christinan values (in the 19th Century) about hard work and thrift.  ? You could evenargue (not sure how true) that whilst child labour was used your particular defendants represented great rols models, insisted on highest welfare standards, and suplemented work with educations, cooked meals that they might otherwise have missed out on!|`|O4oCqaKkaa	A great many children worked in American factories, but few repeated the rags-to-riches rise of Andrew Carnegie. Child labour was a widespread practice encouraged by industry, agreed to by parents, and ignored by government. By 1890, the industrial labour force included some 1.5 million children. For employers, the tiny workers were a bargain, and besides, they claimed that factory work was "good for the little devils." On average, children worked 60 hours a week and carried home pay checks a third the size of adults. "If you speak, they say, 'Get out.'"|`|fc1a879190d20993471e9ab52be8c605aa	I did a little research and could not locate the case you are referring to but I did find the following information.    A decision rendered by the Supreme Court in Hammer v. Dagenhart, state laws prohibiting child labor were argued to be a violation of the Commerce Clause of the Constitution. The federal government was given the "To regulate Commerce withe foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes" (Article 1 Section 8 clause 3), but the issue of child labor was not in congresses jurisdiction, even when state lines were crossed.

65e1b564d76980b1d0a8d6dcb9b68309aa	I have been able to maintain a B average overall in my academic studies.  However, I am constantly striving to do better -- to turn Cs into Bs and Bs into As.  I know that my determination to work hard and to make that extra effort will result in my achieving my ideal A grade average.|`|40MY7GHgaa	Throughout my whole education career, I have maintained a B average in my academic subjects. Whenever I see my report cards, which have As, Bs, and Cs, it drives me to work harder to get my B's to be A's and my C's to be B's. I know that I have the potential to work hard to get my ideal grades if I put my mind into it. Seeing my grades gives me the motivation and the encouragement to put more effort into my work.    Oh and if you can, can you do this one as well?    During my high school career, I have volunteered in many areas. While I was devoting my time at the elementary school, I had the opportunity to work with many children. Also while I was there, I was put in charge of a game booth and was able to meet new people and learn to communicate better with others. Devoting my time at the library, I was able to tutor the younger children and help the other staff members with the books. It did not matter whether I was volunteering at the library or at an elementary school, I was still able to work with other people and develop newer skills at both.

And, talk to your teacher. If you have a question, ask. If your having problems, tell him/her. And be honest. Tell them that your having trouble concentrating in class, and see if they have any suggestions on what you can do to focus.

Tell them what your going to do for the school (Don't make promises you won't keep) and tell them that your approachable, etc. Let them know that you want to do something that the students can enjoy - make sure everything is covered (Sports equipment, books for the library, etc. Of course, don't say it, if your not going to do it)     And for Christ sake, next time you have something for school, don't come on yahoo answers and expect someone to do it for you.

These timepieces are unique in that they need to be wound every eighth day (actually a 7-day clock with a day's grace period).

3OoCiOkAaa	They are all different disciplines or parts that combine to make your  overall health. But they are broken down into specific parts.      Social Health  is  your surroundings and what affect they have on you. Such as poor housing, unemployment, run-down area, vandalism, parks and green areas. You could have great physical health but if what surrounds you is very bleak or dangerous , you social health is  very poor      Mental Health: is the state of your mind, are you mentally positive ? Are you mentally well? Are you depressed? Are you on drugs? Are you being bullied?. You could live in a great area , be employed and have a great job, but you are an alcoholic, depressed or on drugs. So your mental health will be poor, while your social health is fine.            Physical Health can be divided into even more sections. Such as physical fitness health and medical fitness health.    Someone could be suffering from  terminal cancer. So their medical health is poor. However they run a marathon or compete in a triathlon. Which means their physical fitness health is high. They will still die if they are terminally ill as their physical fitness cannot cure their terminal cancer.        Conversely , someone may be a Johnny Six-pack who sits at home watching TV, drinking beers and takes no exercise. They could  also smoke, but medically, they are fine. They have no cancer, diabetes or heart disease. But they are unfit and wouldn't be able to run a marathon, because their fitness health is poor.      When experts look at people you have to look at the overall picture of a person and put all the components together.      There are specialist that deal with each area.      For example      Sociologists with social health  Psychologists and psychiatrists with mental health  Exercise Physiologists with fitness health  Various specialist for medical health such as cardiologists for heart problems, oncologists for cancer and so on         Sometimes various aspects of health can influence each other, such as poor social health may give you mental health problems. But sometimes it doesn't not all people whose social health is poor will have mental health issues. If you use a celebrity as an example they could live in a mansion, with millions in the bank, their garden could look like a public park. There social health is excellent. But they are depressed, so their mental health is poor. Experts would say their overall health is not good because of their depression and they need help.      You could have a little old lady who is poor her house is run-down, but she is mental positive. Her mental health is good, because she is positive. She lives in a drug area, high crime, her social health is poor. She is likely to get robbed, mugged or shot in gang warfare.  So her social health is poor she is at risk and needs help to move out.       As you can see it helps people to identify people who is at risk and who is  in need of help or intervention.

The "or" you are using is binding together two nouns which are modified by the same verb unit "don't enjoy."  The correct way to say it would be to get rid of the comma.  You would only want to use a comma with "or" if you were separating two clauses which could essentially stand on their own.  In this case, the second clause "saturating a sentence in sugary goodness for the other person's pleasure." makes absolutely no sense because there is no subject or verb, it's just a very complex noun (verb + ing is called a gerund, and it functions as a noun, btw).    Your sentence, in terms of structure, is like saying "I like running and jumping", which would look incredibly awkward with a comma before the "and".
kbGmx5siaa	1.How do black smokers form?  They form when hot (roughly 350C), mineral-rich water flows out onto the ocean floor through the volcanic lava on a mid ocean ridge volcano. Sulfide minerals grow or crystallize from the hot water directly onto the volcanic rocks at the place where the hot, mineral-rich water flows from the ground. This crystallization forms a hollow, chimney like sulfide structure through which the hot water continues to flow. As the hot, mineral-rich water rushes out of this chimney and mixes with the cold ocean bottom water, it precipitates a variety of minerals as tiny particles that make the the vent water appear black in color. This is why these sulfide chimney structures are called black smokers.     2.Where are black smokers found?  How are they named?  Black smokers tend to occur on sulfide mounds (large piles of sulfide minerals built up over time) in vent fields that are typically tens of meters across. The areas of these fields range from pool table size (4 square meters) to tennis court size (770 square meters). Vent fields with towering sulfide chimneys on the Juan de Fuca Ridge (the destination of this expedition) have been compared to Bryce Canyon National Park in Utah. Other vents have been given names based on their appearance, such as Anemone Heaven, Garden of Eden, Snake Pit, Whelks Club, and Beehives.     3.they are useful|`|bYU77eteaa	NEWPORTS!!...I thought this was a question about African American Cig.

This water is rich in dissolved minerals from the crust, most notably sulfides. When it comes in contact with cold ocean water, many minerals precipitate, forming a black chimney-like structure around each vent. The metal sulfides that are deposited can become massive sulfide ore deposits in time.  Although life is very sparse at these depths, black smokers are the center of entire ecosystems. Sunlight is nonexistent, so many organisms  such as archaea and extremophiles  convert the heat, methane, and sulfur compounds provided by black smokers into energy through a process called chemosynthesis. More complex life forms like clams and tubeworms feed on these organisms. The organisms at the base of the food chain also deposit minerals into the base of the black smoker, therefore completing the life cycle.|`|AA11635314	Black smokers form up in the hood-----They normally occurs by the liquor store----- They can be both useful and destructive.|`|PrarLmbxaa	1.   They form when hot (roughly 350?C), mineral-rich water flows out onto the ocean floor through the volcanic lava on a mid-ocean ridge volcano  2. They form on sulfide mounds in vent fields. They occur near midocean ridge volcanoes.    3.They are useful because they tak heat and chemical from within the earth and put it in the ocean which controlls the chemistry of the ocean.    "Large amounts of heat and chemical mass are transferred from deep within Earth to Earth's surface through deep-sea hydrothermal vents. The chemistry of ocean water is controlled in part by this process. Thus, understanding how deep-sea hydrothermal vents work is critical to understanding the dynamic nature of our planet. "

SRuMAjSpaa	It seems that while "crying uncle" is today regarded as an Americanism, its origins go all the way back to the Roman Empire. Roman children, when beset by a bully, would be forced to say "Patrue, mi Patruissimo," or "Uncle, my best Uncle," in order to surrender and be freed.  As to precisely "why" bullies force their victims to "cry uncle," opinions vary. It may be that the ritual is simply a way of making the victim call out for help from a grownup, thus proving his or her helplessness. Alternatively, it may have started as a way of forcing the victim to grant the bully a title of respect -- in Roman times, your father's brother was accorded nearly the same power and status as your father. The form of "uncle" used in the Latin phrase ("patrue") tends to support this theory, inasmuch as it specifically denoted your paternal uncle, as opposed to the brother of your mother ("avunculus"), who occupied a somewhat lower rung in patrilineal Roman society.|`|QXQWDw1qaa	Grade school playgrounds... when some child is getting the worst of the beating, supposedly he can yell UNCLE and the other person will stop trouncing his dumb arssez.

O4oCqaKkaa	All experimental uncertainty is due to either random errors or systematic errors. Random errors are statistical fluctuations (in either direction) in the measured data due to the precision limitations of the measurement device. Random errors usually result from the experimenter's inability to take the same measurement in exactly the same way to get exact the same number. Systematic errors, by contrast, are reproducible inaccuracies that are consistently in the same direction. Systematic errors are often due to a problem which persists throughout the entire experiment.
se4W82zbaa	I'll try to help!    1. "check on" can mean to ensure that someone or something is ok or is doing what they should be. For example: I check on the baby to make sure she is sleeping. I check on my students to make sure they are doing their work.    "check out" can mean to sign out or leave. For example: I check out of the hotel after my holiday. I check out three library books a week. "check out" can also be a slang way of saying "looking at": Did you check out that hot babe? Check out that weird guy!    2. Yes, "interests" is correct, but here I would not start the sentence with "what." Instead I might write: I am interested in photography and painting.    3. I would not use any preposition here. "Dread" is fine to stand alone: That's exactly what I dread.    4. I guess you could use either, but I would use "to."    5. Kind of depends what you want to say: He had explosives strapped to his chest. She strapped her baby sister into the car seat.    6. No, you are correct as you have it. Any direct speech should be in the tense you used when you originally said it. However, I would add one word to your sentence: Like I have always said, "There is no free lunch." You could also change your signal phrase: Like I always say, "There is no free lunch."    Hope that makes sense!|`|4ab2ea36c0069d71d94055356c32ea00aa	>    "Check on" is used to say you are going to see if someone or something is OK.  "Jimmy has been sick.  I'm going to go check on him."  "Our business is losing money and our advertising is terrible.  Check on the advertising team and see what is wrong."  "Hi, Mom.  I hope everything is OK.  I'm just calling to check on things."    "Check out" is used in a few different ways.  One is to express your interest in something:  "Check out that car!  Isn't it great?"    "Check out" can also mean you're leaving a hotel.  "Check out time is 12:00."    "Check out" can also mean the place you pay for something in a store, particuarly a grocery store.  "The store is closing.  Please take your items to the check out lane."    "Check out" can also mean you're going to investigate something to get more information.  "There was a noise downstairs.  Go check it out."      Should the verb 'interest' be 'interests because of ' what?'>>    That's a good question.  We would not normally phrase it quite that way.  We would normally say "Photography and painting interest me."      I am not sure of the exact answer to this, but I am going to take a guess at it.  In this case, you're using the phrase "What interests me" to become more like the subject of the sentence.  The word "interest" needs to become "interests" because its subject is the word "What."  That is in the 3rd person singular, so the verb would take on the 3rd person singular form. Again, that's a guess.      I'm not sure the right preposition for 'dread.>>    About.  Though it is cleaner without either one.  "That's exactly what I dread."  You don't want to put a preposition at the end of a sentence.    "I dread about dying."  That sentence would work, but it is better and cleaner without the word "about."    "I dread dying."      I am always confused about the preposition 'for' and 'to.' What's the   difference between for people and to people? How to decide to use   for or to?>>    I think you can change them and still have the same meaning, though it would sound strange to us.  The difference in the examples you cited, at least as best I can tell, seem to be just common phrases and the way we use them.          >    Be careful.  A strap on is something quite different.  ;-)  (I'll let you google that one)    The difference has to do with where the person is.    "Strap onto" is where the object or person is physically on the object, usually on top or on the side.  If you strap a surf board to your car, you are putting it on top of the car.  "Strap that onto the car" would be OK.    "Strap in" tends to be used mainly with your seatbelt.  I haven't heard much usage for this phrase other than that, but that doesn't mean there's none.    "6: Like I always said,' There is no free lunch.' Should I use there was   instead of there is 'because the verb' said?' "    No.  Because you're quoting what you said.  When you quote something, you use exact wording.    If you're using the sentence without quotes, for example:  I always said there is no free lunch.    you still use it in the present tense because now there STILL is no free lunch.    It changes the meaning to say:  I always said there was no free lunch.    Now, there is a chance that there is a free lunch.    Which is making me hungry.  I'm going to post this question then eat.  Hope this helps.|`|WbVE1cXKaa	I just want to add to the other very good answers.    item 2.    I just spent a bit of time writing about how it should be written and why, but I found that I was confusing even myself, and started to question whether it should be "interest" or interests"    part of the problem comes from the fact that the sentence contains a secondary clause (like in sentences such as "my cat ate the cookie that I dropped on the floor" or "the ball hit jimmy, who was on the ground at the time")     I think the easiest way to look at it is to turn the sentence around, which you can do because the main verb is "to be" (is).    If you do that, you get  painting and photography ARE what INTEREST me.    So, it is clear that the subject of the "to be" part of the phrase is a plural and so the verb MUST BE plural as well.    As for interest or interests, I wanted to say that you should use interests, as in "what INTERESTS me" because that is what sounds right to me when said by itself.  By I think that the rule is that the word "what" refers to "painting and photography" (just like "that" refers to cookie and "who" refers to Jimmy in my examples), and because what refers to a plural, it needs a plural verb form.  And this is why I used a plural verb form when I turned the sentence around.    but when you start the sentence with "what", whether the word is supposed to be singular or plural can get lost by the complexity of the sentence, and so people tend to use the singular verb in that situation.    So, you will often hear "what interests me are painting and photography", but I am pretty sure that it should be "what interest me are painting and photography".    Now you see why I confused myself.    And they say that english is an easy language to learn.
