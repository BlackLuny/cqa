T864ejaiaa	no it's love he's not. you have to understand, catholics do not believe in birth control. spanish people love to have big family's. yu can talk to her and explain to her why you feel she needs to stop. ask her to get fixed. good luck and god bless.|`|8oAlBL91aa	Alright another one of those questions when someone didn't pay attention to the story they made up. <br>  <br>  Your dad is abusive, alcoholic, and not a good person BUT he's a priest...think people before you make up crap.|`|ben0NvDDaa	Chances are this will be the last one.  The chances of getting pregers at 46 are improbable so to do it again afterwards is not very likely.<br>  <br>  If your mom is taking full responsibility for the kids and can afford to do it, than I'm not sure you have much to argue.  However, you can start reminding her that she'll be on Social Security by the time the kid graduates high school.|`|l8c2kTlvaa	maybe you should just share your feelings with her, it may not change anything but at least you can tell her about how you feel with her having even more children.|`|aIXeSThOaa	wow no idea <br>  your dad sounds like mine <br>  good luck <br>  peace XP|`|MCTyWCu2aa	She was 15 when she had her first? Are you making this up?|`|luCReaXcaa	You are her son and she should take the time to listen to you about your concerns.  Ask her to sit down with you and try to keep the conversation civil.  Make a list ahead of time of your concerns and/or questions to ask and subjects to talk about.  If she is a devoted and concerned parent, she will listen to what you have to say.  But, the final decision is hers when she will stop being pregnant and providing you more siblings.|`|kgDH2BILaa	tell her if she keeps putting buns in her oven she's gonna end up like octo-mom
rvFqdocjaa	Ask your Dr. for Clomid<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|kTu7UtS1aa	Unless you take fertility drugs, there is nothing that you can do on your own to make yourself have twins.  Your ovaries will have to release 2 eggs, and then those 2 eggs must be fertilized by sperm (fraternal twins).  Or, after you conceive, that egg divides by two (identical twins).|`|0fLwSsGNaa	Go to India... The Dr. there can do whatever...
jd4MzIYtaa	you can freeze anything~! If you invest a little in a food saver it will become your best friend. I freeze soup in it,vegetables,casseroles,fruit. You dont have to have one, freezer bags work good too. You can freeze anything nowadays. my only suggestion to vegggies is blanch them and that way hen you reheat they are not soggy so to speak/I am so excited for you! You know what is a neat trick too. Freeze unused wine in icecube trays and use them for sauces later. They go great over meats and chicken. Can also use this trick for alfredo sauce or chicken broth. When feeding young children the portions are perfect. A couple cubes and they wil love it|`|8WRnqs08aa	I froze taco meat, lasagne, beef stroganoff, beef stew & Cheesy broccolii & chicken rice caserole.<br>  <br>  I had garlic bread, rolls and veggies in the freezer to go with each dish, as well as salad & tortillas in the refrigerator.<br>  <br>  My family just had to heat the frozen item, then serve with its sides. It made it so much easier for me when I came home from the hospital after a c-section.<br>  <br>  My sister helped me prepare and I froze two weeks worth of meals.<br>  <br>  <br>  Happy Cooking!<br>  <br>  <br>  Mother to 4 beautiful children with Twins due 09/2009 (Babies #5&6)|`|5RvTXdmUaa	I dont have any yummy ideas but I was wondering this myself. I'll have to check on this again laterto see what people say :)|`|9cpwsrJiaa	Pastas and chili keep well in the fridge/freezer. Hamburger Helper is a lifesaver too!|`|NPmRmnG6aa	I have Lasagna in the freezer, I am going to make some chicken noodle soup. I am thinking about beef stew. I am also going to go to the store and get some skillet dinners. I am just making my normal dishes, just a little more so we can freeze the leftovers.|`|ZSSUfSXwaa	Well you can cook anything you like really and then you can just freeze it up and voila!<br>   You could freeze up some ground beef-it goes well with a million things... pasta, rice, etc So two choices, or both, freeze complete meals.. or some items of meals, like ground beef, pasta, etc and then you can mix and match at will!<br>  or just cook any dish you like or your family likes... and that's it.
0a0hlTlUaa	My 11 month old son does this too. And I think it is definitely due to teething.|`|oA8Rtyxuaa	a lot of kids do this and im not sure why. some kids do it when they are upset, but that doesn't sounds like you little man...some kids might do it because it feels funny and they don't know when to stop therefore they push it too far and end up throwing up? not sure though!|`|4084a028d749f0067792bb6e4278b52daa	my son did that. it drove me crazy. he got a reaction out of me which he thought funny. so he'd do it again. and again. hes 3 and every once in awhile he still does it! they will learn. if you ignore it. if that doesnt work. tell his dr.|`|6VbNJOtfaa	My son went through that phase months ago, and it has just resurfaced in the last week or so (he is 13 months).  Maybe it has to do with the moon or something lol!  I hope that it is normal because he goes on little spurts of doing it and then stops.  A few days ago I caught him in the bathroom shoving his hand down his throat and gagging...<br>  <br>  Boys!!!|`|3dT7f39maa	Dont worry its just a stage he's going through, most kids go through that.  Wait till the biting stage starts.....aghhhhhhh|`|GCPbKg9Eaa	The boy I babysit does it. He only did it though when his molars were coming in.<br>  I have not noticed my 10 month old son ever doing this..although he is just gettting his front teeth.
WXkTi3JWaa	Everyone needs to send their kids to a professional like me to do the sex talk.|`|UCq7SjsRaa	I have a 5 year old daughter, and although I haven't told her graphically what sex is, she knows what sex is, what it's for and when and with who you should do it with. In our house it's called a special cuddle, and that you only do a special cuddle with someone that you really love. I also told her that that is how life is made, and that the man has a seed and a woman has eggs and is like the earth etc etc. I thought it was best to start early so that it wasn't a taboo.|`|4WyUrWaIaa	I would say about 7-8 to tell the basics in low key terms, as they grow older, it's best to have continues talks in the teen years, in more detail. It would result in the conversations been a lot less awkward when they are older, and it would make a special understanding between the parent & child.|`|v0aKxF6iaa	I hope tp have an open relationship with my son so that he will come to me with any questions he may have. Kids these days are becoming sexually active at younger and younger ages so If my son doesnt come to me first i will sit him down at around 10 years old and explain to him the details. I'd rather me tell him then naive kids his age. I've heard things kids think are true like if the girls is on top she can't get pregnant and stuff like that.|`|JILkhKjJaa	If they are old enough to ask the question then they are old enough to know the answer. But I have always been very open and honest with all my children.|`|RGYbKzp2aa	Oh no, They get all the basics at school about sex. I would wait tell your child is starting to show a interest in the other sex. Maybe, early middle school?!?!|`|Fm7z09Kwaa	I'm not a parent yet but I think it must be about the age of seven.|`|hKJIDdVqaa	my children had the talk young.  They were not buying the old stork dropped your sister off story.  All of my children know basic info on sex, body parts and their appropriate functions.  You can never be too careful now a days.  I wanted my children properly informed.  I also wanted them to feel comfortable coming to us with questions.|`|NeTNnvSZaa	I don't think I ever had a formal "talk", things over time have just come up and I've used those opportunities to teach.  TV is wonderful for portraying real life problems and giving families an opportunity to talk about these things openly.<br>  <br>  That being said my son is 13 and knows just about everything from his developing body to sex, pregnancy and contraception.|`|YuVSDBkzaa	I think it should be done in stages. My mom didn't give me the sex talk until I was 15 (and she ONLY did it because her counselor insisted on it) and by that time I already new pretty much everything I needed to know about sex from my own little research at the library and online, etc. One thing I know I'll do differently with my daughter is talk more about puberty and how the body changes, etc. I'll probably start around 8 because I started puberty at 9 and I didn't know ANYTHING! When I started growing pubic hair, I thought it was the grossest thing and no man was ever going to want to marry me because he would think it was disgusting. It wasn't until I was 12 and saw a pencil drawing of the male and female puberty stages in one of my dad's medical books that I realized MEN grow hair down there too! It was such a relief! LOL I know, I was very sheltered! HAHA.<br>  <br>  My daughter is four now and I'm expecting my second child. I kind of expect her to start asking questions about where babies come from but she hasn't. At this age, I would just tell her that God grows the baby in mommies tummy and uses part of the daddy (sperm) and part of the mommy (egg) to create a baby and it's a very special thing. I have also thought about getting a book for children when she is a couple years older and reading it WITH her.|`|4gZYucHMaa	I've spoken to my then 5 yr old when her brother showed up, she's smart so I gave her a very child friendly version.<br>  <br>  Once again, when we had bunnies I explained the sex talk again to both kids this time.<br>  <br>   I figure if I broach this stuff now, It'll get easier when she's older.|`|4e67Pdfvaa	6 they learned the basics.. penis and vagina go together to make a baby.. and as they got older and asked questions the discussion got more involved.|`|flqAr30laa	I think you should start young with info that is age appropriate.|`|JcwjDpY8aa	My parents never had the talk.  When I was about 7, my mother rented a video from blockbuster that was a cartoon, and explained the birds and the bees in an understanding way without being too graphic, and impressed at the end to come to my parents if I ever was confused about anything etc.  The video taught about sex, what it was, how it happens, what happens if you do it before you are married (struggles of a single parent, getting sicknesses, etc)... it also focused on the subject of what are their private areas, and to never allow anyone to touch them, and that any kind of touching that makes them uncomfortable is wrong, and how to say NO..|`|cen8SIssaa	in my opinion you should not just make "the talk" a one time thing....you should start as early as you can like with good touch/bad touch, and then later move on to when a man and a woman love each other a child can be born, and gradually get more detailed as they get older and older and time they are able  to fully understand the concept you can go into detail about the actual physicality of it and dangers of it... maybe in their early teens.|`|AA12071655	Just before puberty let them know that their body is about to undergo some changes; when I underwent puberty nobody told me anything and it scared the bejesus out of me (nipples were sore and painful, hair growing in places it hadn't before, for the girls it can definitely be worse). <br>  <br>  During or after puberty explain why the body is changing and what it leads to. Be frank, don't make sex "dirty."|`|w3tNq8npaa	Yeah.......I'm not a parent.I'm only 15.<br>  My parents never talked to me about sex.I know what I know from my friends and the internet.And I'm smart enough to know that I shouldn't have sex without a condom and birth control.<br>  Also,my parents trust me so I wouldn't want to disappoint them by not waiting.|`|prqrQcd1aa	I don't think it should be based on age, I think it should be done when the child hits puberty. That can happen at any age! I haven't had the sex talk with my 7 year old, but she does know the basic differences between boys and girls and she knows about good touches and bad touches!|`|AA11987492	I strongly believe that there should be no such thing as "the talk" it should be an ongoing dialouge from day one. (well maybe not day one per say, but you know what I mean).|`|gTjtaG0Faa	basic info: age 12<br>  more info when they start showing interest in the opposite sex.|`|T864ejaiaa	at 9. but always tell them no one touches them in private parts. if so they need to tell you.
2ObqoJbKaa	headaches are part of pregnancy. Everyone is different, some people will get  more of them, some less. Its normal. Just try taking some tylenol to help with them. Also, try to keep yourself relaxed, I think that stress brings on headaches worse during pregnancy, especially for me. good luck.|`|wKuQC4yTaa	I actually have less head aches now more than ever.
stRWElvPaa	Hey, that was a lovely little poem. And about the false positive--have you ever heard of a chemical pregnancy? Look it up because that is probably what you had if you saw a positive and then a couple of days later a negative.<br>    Sometimes when I feel a bit empty on inspiration I look at quotes, like on the website quoteland.com they have inspiring quotes and quotes on many different topics.<br>    I hope this helps a little. It's important to always keep your eye on the goal and do all you can to achieve it. good luck and baby dust!x|`|Ll39LhkLaa	I have made a little plan in my head that I will not allow myself to stress til I'm trying for a certain length of time, then and only then will I get checked out for problems.  Telling myself the shortest time it took any couple I know was 4 months.  And buying lots of clothes!  also each month when AF comes I drink lots of coffee because I can, having avoided it in the 2ww just in case !  xx|`|zdlLVB1Kaa	Until recently what cheered me up was my husband's undying support and a good hug and a kiss and his arms wrapped around me.  Recently though a friend gave me a book called "Supernatural Childbirth" which shows how it is God's intention for you to get pregnant and that if you believe enough and want it badly enough, God will answer your prayers (it also discusses how to have painless birth).  After reading the book, I feel at complete peace.  My husband and I made love a couple of times this month around ovulation time and now I am in the TWW and not stressed about it one bit.  If it is our month then fabulous.  If not then I'll be ok because I know that one day God will answer my prayers.
hWc65sEtaa	I suffer from severe panic attacks normally.  They gave me oxygen and helped me get through my panic attack.<br>  <br>  I had 3 daughters and had excellent experiences with all of them.  The drs and nurses are there for you and are very comforting.|`|0Ei3ePJzaa	We all panic honestly, but, when the time comes, you just will be able to handle it.  The last stages of labour, when you're thinking "what on earth was I thinking" is so short, maybe you don't think so, but it is, and before you know it, you are holding your little miracle.  I swear to you with every bone in my body, the pain and labour is all forgotten when that happens.  <br>  <br>  Your body is made to do this, and there are really good drugs if you feel you need something to take the edge off, in my last labour, I didn't have time for any, and I am a certified wimp, yet I still managed to deliver my baby.  <br>  <br>  Remember, deep breaths, and think of what you will have at the end, you will be just fine.<br>  <br>  Congratulations by the way.<br>  xx|`|8ZEqAwJ7aa	OK, so here is the truth. I won't sugar coat this. The epidural only helps the contraction pains to go away. So I would for sure have one. Contractions feel like cramps you have when you have your period except multiply that times 20. The pain hits you when you have to push the baby out, you will feel a lot of pressure, and burning like you are ripping your vagina. This is the worst of the pain, if you can push through this you will be done! It hurts, I am being honest with you. However, I am about to have my 3rd child, if it was really horrible, would I be doing it again, and again? Just remember, the majority of your pain goes away when the baby comes out. So push very hard even though it hurts to push.|`|cPlDc7I1aa	It's only natural to feel scared.  I wasn't sure if first time round was the worst (fear of the unknown) or second time (fear cos you know what's coming!! lol)  but actually no, we really are designed to deal with it.  It's amazing how your instincts just kick in and you get on with the job in hand, so to speak.  I worried more with my second because i'd had a rough delivery with my first, but when my waters broke i was as calm as anything and just went with the flow.  Speak to your gp or midwife if you are worried about panic attacks (do you normally have them?).  My midwives and the auxilliaries were amazing when i was having my two boys, talking to me, talking me through it all, telling me how wonderfully i was doing. And take the pain relief if you feel you need it, but you might surprise yourself and do fine without!<br>  <br>  Best of luck and it will all be worth it when you get that little miracle in your arms!|`|UFu0h8SKaa	when it happens you'll have too much going on for a panic attack! There's no point in worrying, it's got to come out sometime. Just try to remember why you're doing this and look at the bigger picture. Some people have loads of kids, if it was that bad people wouldn't do it again. It'll be a walk in the park, and don't listen to anyone who says otherwise. Good luck!|`|eDmdkUO3aa	I had the same exact feelings as you. I was a lot more calm than I thought I was going to be. Be sure to get an epidural and you'll be aok!|`|zRQmWC5saa	I think all women have this same problem. But dont worry , once u go into labor all that stuff leaves u and all ur worried about is wanting it out!  dont worry , mother nature knows what to do .  women been having babies for many many centries. the only time u should panic is when ur blood pressure is very high and keeps rising . mine did that and then went to a very low digit , i was scared but at the same time I wanted just peace, I felt like I was dieing  ( which I probally was and didnt care) I heard them saying code blue and something about the helicopter to take me to another hospital and  they was pumping all kinds of shots in my hand veins to get my pressure back up again. it was a scary thing to go through but really ur not scared when it happens.<br>  sorry of my story scared u more but u need to keep ur blood pressure at a normal pressure before going into labor , thats a must.  congrats! and good luck!|`|h5cFkP35aa	it's probably too late for birthing classes but they have some good breathing at mental techniques to keep you in tact during labor. but just google 'breathing techniques' and you should come up with something to keep yourself calm. <br>  <br>  i worry about the same - im 32 weeks and suffer from panic attacks before pregnancy and they took me off my meds. but i try to keep in mind that this is very natural and billions of women go through it. you WILL make it lol good luck hun|`|jrOISaj4aa	I have a really bad problem with anxiety as well but for some reason, possibly all my friends that have gone into labor assure me, YOU CAN DO IT! So I'm not fearing it as much. They have pain meds, epidurals, and if you're that nuts they'll just take him/her cesarean. You'll be fine, take deep breaths and realize its one little day out of your life, and there is nothing more rewarding than seeing your little one at the end of it all!!<br>  Congrats momma.|`|piCMW7ZCaa	Well, it's something we all have to go through if we get pregnant.  It's natures law.... It is painful, don't get me wrong, but it's a pain that has a reward afterward. If you have cramps with your period, then you already know whats coming. You will be ok.  Just think that in the end, you'll be holding that precious baby that you've been waiting for.  So, batten down the hatches and push with all your might, and then post a pic of your baby, so we can see the end result! lol,,,,|`|115I5Polaa	I felt the same way!  But as soon as I got the epidural I was fine.  And what I was really scared of was pushing my daughter out, but to my surprise that was the easy part!  I only pushed for 15 min!  Good luck and you will be fine!|`|kvYgopThaa	Just sit back and let your body do its job. Your body was built for this and your instincts will take over during labor. you can do this,  just try to stay relaxed and think about holding your wonderful bundle of joy|`|RzaP9bQmaa	I was like you and had the same thoughts, the best advice I can give you, is just relax and don't panic.  The more you will relax and don't think to much about it the more easier it becomes.|`|tnOZ49JQaa	Take the epidural and you'll do just fine!! Its such a great experience!! I know it's hard not to be nervous, but you'll do great.|`|tfaUNlvtaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  I'm 37 weeks with my second baby and starting to get nervous about the birth. My first birth was not a great birth experience but the mre you stress about it the worse it will be (easy to say, I know!) The best advice I can give is to really let your body relax when the contractions start. The more tense you are the more it will hurt and stress the baby. Also keep breathing slowly and deeply. It's a good idea to have a birth plan in place but certainly don't expect things to go to plan as they rarely do. At the end of the day you have little control if things don't go to plan. Having said that, don't be afraid to question why they are doing something and ask if it really is necessary. They were trying to induce me when I told them I could feel the baby coming. The two of them were debating whether or not to keep trying when I was refusing!!! This is where your partner can also help and intervene if you feel you are not being given choices. It's your birth after all and they really should explain why they are doing something. Good luck and don't worry, it's really not that bad and you'll have a beautiful baby at the end of it. Take care :-)
O97ZoHGXaa	they don't tend to always show signs of constipation.<br>  make sure his fluid intake is up and he is not dehydrated. If he hasn't by tomorrow and your still concerned then ask your health care provider. its better then being worried!|`|WpBqlEW5aa	Go to the store and get some gerber prunes with apples. Only give him a couple spoon fulls. This REALLY helps get things moving. Or, you can give him a little prune juice too..either or.<br>  I don't believe he caught what you have. Normally the stomach bug MAKES you go to the bathroom. And, because you had a fever, it is a bug, not food poisoning. But, just watch him and make sure he doesn't start showing symptoms for that too!|`|688c403afa0715767110cfa7a696a616aa	You don't say how old he is.  Standard answer - give him a baby-size glycerine suppository.  No side-effects, nonaddictive, and guaranteed to make him do a smelly in under 20 minutes.|`|6SNhg2iwaa	apple juice works wonders (not diluted)<br>  yes you should be concerned if the juice doesnt work|`|yoNXldH8aa	My son's pediatrician said when I started him on rice cereal (at 3 weeks with her approval because he wanted to eat too often and hes a formula fed baby) that he could get constipated and to mix 2 oz of prune juice with 2 oz of water. It works he only drank like 2 oz total though but it did work! Try alternating rice cereal or oatmeal feedings with just plain breast milk that also might help if you don't want to give your baby juice.|`|nQyJFOMZaa	My son did the same thing on cereal it's actually constipating for them. My Pediatrician suggested to give him some juice(gerber apple or pear juice 1oz juice to 1oz water) it helped him go poop with in 40 mins of giving him the juice I would call your pediatrician and ask.|`|PA7LOoQ9aa	its just because your are feeding him thicker and more solid foods. so his schedule will probably re work itself to a new one now. if your really concerned do like the nurse did for my day old that wouldnt poop give him water it wont hurt him but it helps to loosen things up. my son pooped with in couple hours. i had to do it again a few days later it worked great!!!|`|jd4MzIYtaa	feed him a little karo light corn syrup. It works like a charm. It is the best soultion to a constipated baby,child,adult period. I am sure he will like it too because it is sweet. You can even mix it with mashed bananas if you like but plain syrup alone will do the trick. A couple teaspoons at most will work!|`|2Z00M2Qvaa	When my kids got a little backed up  I would give them some bottle/sippy cup of milk with about teas-spoon of dark carol syrup in it.

iqz2tYEBaa	When I was pregnant with my daughter her movements felt like a roller coaster moving across my belly.  I think she was more interested in doing somersaults than kicking.  It was pretty amazing.  I think movement feels different for everyone.  As long as baby is moving around then you should worry about how it feels.|`|ROJans2Taa	I dont remember my first but my second would range from frantic movements to weird slow swooshing motions, I always wondered what he was doing in there,lol|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	It did once I entered the third trimester. Now sometimes it feels like she is just stretching in there and taking her time. I figure it's the lack of space. :]|`|TljXiSNnaa	OMG i was wondering the same thing. sometimes in my lower abdomen i feel like something moving really slow kinda like they are rolling over and then it stops...i thought it was gas at first and then i was like this hassss to be my baby!!!!<br>  <br>  feels great doesnt it|`|25aCEsHtaa	I CAN UNDERSTAND i worry about everything to this is my first, i havent felt mine move yet when did you first feel your baby move. sorry i couldnt help|`|s1utniuvaa	I have 2 in there and I can feel them rolling around and yes, some times it feels like they are rolling in slowmo... it feels so weird!|`|AA11612508	yes. it can be slow or fast kick. if its slow shes probably just swiming around or moving slowly|`|tnOZ49JQaa	Depend on how far along you are, what you've eaten, and if they're just excited. If your only a few months preg. it feels like popcorn poppin in your belly not hard, but a soft feel. Sometimes yea, they'll move really slow, but watch out because they can be fast little boogers too. As long as ;you feel movement every so often, then your ok.|`|1m7eGZdeaa	yess.. the bigger my son got the slower his kicks and punches got considering he was running out of room to play. i can always tell a difference now in kicks & hiccups. His hiccups are much faster feeling.|`|jrOISaj4aa	I used to feel kicks now its more stretching and pushing, less room means more slow motion.

3F8f1SoQaa	I sincerely doubt that your 19 month old is "lazy" and would prefer to not speak. He has a severe expressive speech delay and needs treatment. COntact your local early intervention program and ask for them to do a speech evaluation. They will arrange for him to have speech therapy, possibly even at your home. Once this starts they will send someone out to visit him 1-on-1 at least once a month...sort of like a visting preschool teacher, and things like that. They may even teach him ( and you) sign language to bridge the gap until he can catch up verbally.    This has nothing to do with how smart he is. My son said 10 words at 2 years old, and did the things that your son is doing. He ALSO had horrible tantrums from frustration. Once he started speech therapy he picked up sign language very fast, but within a few months he started talking too. He still has some issues at 3.5 years old, but he has made TONS of progress.|`|1s3nddaYaa	he just might wanna be a late talker. my son will be 17 months and can say i think around 10 or 11 words, but only says two of them every day, hot and hey.  he knows things like shut the door, put it in the trash, and he knows stuff we talk about just doesnt say it. my aunt said my cousin didnt talk till late either cause he didnt need to. he got what he wants across and didnt need to speak. all you can do is just keep at it. when he feels ready he will talk your head off.|`|FTFd3AQAaa	my son is nearly 19 months as well and has very little language skills, i asked his doctor about it at his last check up (18 month) and he wasn't concerned, i was told not to worry until 2-2 1/2, remember all children develop differently sure most kids are saying more at this age but it doesn't mean there is a problem with our kids... if that doesn't ease your mind i highly recommend making an appointment with his doctor to discuss your fears|`|1enIWBGnaa	Why are YOU allowing him to be the 'boss'???<br>  YOU refuse to get him what he wants until he asks plainly and clearly for it - or he doesn't get it!<br>  Also, he must NOT have access to a TV.  It's your responsibility to educate and entertain your child.|`|8Jwe8ODOaa	I would just continue talking to him as much as possible and enouraging him to speak. You should make sure to mention it to his pediatrician he may recommend taking him to a speech pathologist/therapist.|`|koymw0cZaa	Minor Opration under his tong|`|SWbiblvPaa	iM NOT SAYING ANYTHING IS WRONG CAUSE EVERY CHILD LEARNS TO SPEAK AT DIFFERENT TIMES BUT I WOULD GET HIM TESTED JUST IN CASE IT CANT HURT HIM ONLY HELP..  GOOD LUCK|`|PeEIuzP5aa	It wil come to him just give him time, boys are like that it not that their are slow, they just don't want to. keep at him and he will come around.<br>  Good luck|`|Jk4wnsZwaa	He's only 19 months old-my son is 20 months old and is the same way.  Its completely normal for them to do that.  He's not 'refusing' to talk...he's just young still.|`|qMYbGqiwaa	My son was 2 1/2 before he said anything except mama and dada.  He was in speech therapy and it just was not helping.  One day he woke and  spoke 3 word sentences and his talking just took off from there, in a month he was able to hold a full conversation with anyone- it was amazing.  He could do it all along, he just didn't want to!  And now he's 7 and has a huge vocabulary, reads great, spells fine, ect... So I know you are worried because we certianly were but pretty soon he will be talking your ear off!  Good Luck!|`|vCq3dR40aa	You can try teaching him sign language.  He may not be able to make all the sounds yet, but babies as young as 7 months can use sign language.  Start with a few high impact signs.  Milk, eat, cracker, all done.   There are video tapes that make it very easy for parent and baby to pick up the signs.<br>  You could get Baby Signing Time Vol. 1 and 2 from Amazon.com<br>  As long as you say it and sign it most of the time, your son will eventually learn to do the same.<br>  <br>  This will speed the point where he can have positive control over a piece of his life and he will want to use language.  Additionally, it may help you figure out what he is trying to say because he may try to sign it at the same time.<br>  <br>  Type in baby sign language to google and believe the benefits!
EtCRnDJMaa	I'll be honest.  I don't want somebody eles's kid, it's that simply!  If I didn't have my own i wouldn't have any.  <br>  <br>  If you're confused about your feelings then you shouldn't do it.|`|bYhqPOtwaa	It depends on the parents' reason for choosing adpotion.<br>  <br>  If they choose to adopt because the truly want a child, they have the love and compassion to raise the child as if it were their biological child.<br>  <br>  If they choose to adopt in order to get money from the welfare or foster care programs, or if they are in a situation that they feel they *should* adopt a family member's child, then in some cases it may be impossible for them to love the child as much as a biological child.<br>  <br>  A person that chooses adoption that *truly* wants a child will love and care for it wholly and unconditionally. The only difference between an adopted and biological child in the instance is that the child grew in her mother's heart instead of her womb.<br>  <br>  And yes, I would consider adoption. Sometimes I actually feel guilty for choosing to have a biological child when there are so many unwanted children available to adopt.|`|AA10494763	I can and have adopted and i love both children the same.  I don't see a difference .  I do agree that not everyone can adopt and not everyone should.   I am sorry for you but i think that is more of your mothers issue of trying to keep a man then the general public|`|Ki6jlwnbaa	I think some people are able to love an adopted child like it is their own, and some people can't. I would adopt, I think I would be able to. I would adopt because I wouldn't want the child to grow up in a home. I am expecting now so I would wait til my own is older.|`|T864ejaiaa	all i read is the title. yes i would love any child. kids are precious. blood might be thicker then water. but a child was not asked to be born. we must show them we care and love them.|`|wiAVa1H5aa	I think there are many people in the world who can just love children, where the child comes from or who they are related to biologically.  <br>  <br>  There are some of us that also recognize our limits, I know I would not be able to love an adopted child as much as my own - when I would babysit I had to take a shower to get the smell of other people's kids off of me, I knew they were not mine just from their smell.   For me it's pretty primitive and basic, I recognize when some trait, physical and temperamental, did not come from my family and I have a visceral response.   I could care for other folks kids with love and acceptance, and I would do what I could to raise them right but I know my gut reaction isn't to love them as my own.   Not good enough when you want to adopt kids.<br>  <br>  It's selfish perhaps, but perhaps it's being more fair to other children when I recognize that.   And it makes me sad, my oldest brother was not related biologically to my dad and dad was the only father in his life.   He loved my brother of course, but he recognizes now there was more antagonism towards him then there should of been.   Plus, oldest sibs get the job of breaking in new parents, so that's hard enough - his job was worse since the new father was not his.|`|h6cYQaxYaa	I would rather adopt than have my own. For many reasons but most of all there are kids out there that need good homes and loving parents. My hubby and I would be great parents and would love the child no matter how they came in to our life.|`|ad9efc98eb0fbeeae6b6c4abfd63046caa	oh marie i believe you can love an adopted child just as much as one of your own and if you care as much for your children as you do for you dogs  i have said this before you will be a wonderful mom|`|AA12385489	Yes, they can.<br>  Once a child is adopted they are seen as blood children and loved just as much by the parents.<br>  <br>  I would adopt children without hesitation.  They deserve to grow up with forever families and parents, not foster homes.<br>  <br>  <br>  I'm sorry you went through that experience.  That is not the norm with adoptive parents.|`|HbciMmROaa	I would never adopt Not because I am evil or uncaring..I know there are children out there that need a good home..And I was adopted at the age of 5..I say this because I know for a fact that I was not loved by my adopted parents not a feeling..I was told. I was just a way for them to make more money and for her to keep her man.<br>  <br>  I am too scared to ever adopt because I am affraid in some sick way I wont be able to love that child like it was really mine.|`|TTkIoQGyaa	This is going to get confusing. so bear with me.<br>  I dont think that blood is thicker than water. My dad was adopted and my mother wasnt. I do not talk to her parents because, honestly, in my eyes they are dead. But my dads parents, although they are not biological grandparets mean the world to me. I didnt even meet my dads mum as she passed away a month before i was born but i still feel more love for her than my mums parents. <br>  <br>  I would adopt, and i wouldnt love them any differently to any biological child i had. I think you get to a point in life where blood doesnt matter anymore. If someone gives you respect you give it them back. Same with love. I think most, sane, women would look at a baby that they were given, blood or not and have instant love. How could you not love something that gives you instant love?|`|a1uoxczTaa	you sound horrible. i love my adopted brothers and sisters more then my real brothers and sisters. if it doesn't include family then i think yea blood is thicker than water.... ONLY TO MY FRIENDS! my adopted siblings are blood. I will consider adoption when i am older. I will also like to look into being a foster parent when i have settled down more and i am positive there will be a few children out there that were born just to be with me. i will give some one a better life and not look at them differently just because my blood does not flow through their veins.|`|ghz5D5iLaa	Yes you can love an adopted child as much as your own. You don't love a child because of where it came from but for the child. My husband is not my oldest child's father. He loves him like his own and you cannot tell he is not his. My other two kids claim that he is his favorite. That is not true they just do more together, they have the same interests. My kids have friends that live a terrible life, a lot of them are with us quite a bit and go everywhere with us. I love them like they were mine, I miss them when they go home and I worry about them when they are gone. I try to make sure that they have what they need and try to make their lives better. I guess it depends on the person. Living the life you did you will make sure not to treat another child like you were treated. Nothing is worse for a child than to feel unwanted. I would adopt or even foster but my husband does not want to. He says we have enough of our own and that I always find the strays on top of that.|`|h8OqX12Haa	i was adopted when i was 9 month old i didnt know about that until i was 7 years old and my adoptive parents didnt tell me that we lived in a small town where everyone knew each other and a friend of my mom told me that<br>  it wasnt easy growing up i was always the child that everyone made fun of i was teased kind pointed fingers at me etc......<br>  <br>  and i have no idea who my real parents are well were cause ive heard that they died in a car accident or sometihng i dont know but simply i dont care im happy with what i have now<br>  <br>  <br>  my mom mother is getting on my nerves lately shes talking **** behind my back shes kinda unstable i tihnk so everyday its a different story but i havent talked with her for a year now and im not gonna listen ot her bull_****<br>  <br>  but i dont og around telling that im adopted simply because from my earlier experience i tihnk that people might turn on me for some reason i dont know wh ybut thats just a gut feeling|`|QP46eVi4aa	my children is awesome and would not trade the for anything then we have a child that we keep cause of not good parents and we think of him as our own we treat him like ours and always will and blood is blood but all you have to do is have a heart adn they are easy to love|`|RqEwgDRdaa	Yes, but if you don't have that kind of love in to you to love a child that isn't related to you, then it's best you never adopt at all, even as a last resort. <br>  <br>  Only special people with a true ability to love should be adopting.<br>  <br>  That whole blood is thicker than water idea is total, ignorant, bullsh*t.  Please don't teach your kids that ignorant bullsh*t.  You aren't blood related to your husband.  Anyone who cannot love people that aren't related to them shouldn't be having kids.  Because they will pass that ignorant bullsh*t on to their kids, and teach their kids to only love people they are related to.  Do get comfortable around other people's kids, because hopefully you'll want your child to have friends.<br>  <br>  If you choose not to be comfortable around other people's kids, don't expect anyone to want to be around yours.<br>  <br>  But you have your mind made up, so don't adopt if you don't want to.|`|uhZzEzu0aa	I think it goes both ways. My great grand father took off and married this women who had 3 children. He loved those children with all of his heart yet not once wanted to look after the children he actually fathered. My daugther is in adoption it's open so i'm allowed to see her her a mom and her a dad love her more than life itself there isn't anything they wouldn't do for her. You honestly cant tell she's adopted because in there hearts thats there baby. I often wondered if i would have the courage and the strength to do adoption truth is i'm not sure but i would love the chance one day and if i'm able to to be a foster parent. I'm sorry i was never adopted or have adoptive but i still wanted to give my views on it.
gJlxZdL5aa	It sounds like you would prefer to work than to be sattled with a another child.<br>  <br>  Why not finish school and get a job and then once you've been at your job for a year start trying for a second child if you still want to.    Then you can continue working during pregnancy and then go on Maternity leave and then after that go back to work.<br>  <br>  I'm afraid you might resent your child if the child keeps you from doing what you want to do.<br>  <br>  You have one child enjoy him for a few years....enjoy that one on one.   Get your degree you never know when it will come in handy.<br>  <br>  <br>  I plan on having our child and then going to school while he is a baby but still being able to be home as much as possible with the baby.....the difference is I have to work and do school<br>  <br>  <br>  ADD: Some colleges have a daycare program for returning students with children Look into your school for that or Church day  care is usually much cheaper.<br>  <br>  If you are doing as bad as you are you are in no position to bring another child into this world until you both have stable jobs and stable income.<br>  <br>  So you need to get you degree and get a job and then have another child somewhere way down the road.   I wouldn't bring another child into your situation sounds like you can barely afford the one you have|`|G2auAv1Saa	Is working before your child goes to school not an option? <br>  There are perfectly fine day cares "she" can attend. <br>  <br>  What I did (I went to college before having kids) was had my daughter and found a wonderful place for her during work hours and take as much vacation as I can. I am pregnant again and I will do that same thing.<br>  <br>  <br>  edit: I would have to agree with the first poster. If your financial shape is that bad I would suggest you wait until it is a little better, like after college. Many colleges have daycares in them that are little or no charge. There may also be charities that can help with daycare for your child you have now. I think you are on the right track to getting your degree and it sounds like your family really needs it right now and having another child under these circumstances isn't responsible.
q4rG5Dwtaa	Maybe she's still hungry or, maybe she doesn't like the pacifier you are giving her. I tried tons of pacifiers until Jack finally found one he likes.|`|IlyS8KGzaa	If you get a "Soother" pacifier, the kind you can put your finger in and hold it there for her for a minute, she might take it better.  It's not really good to let her suck on an empty bottle, as it could cause an air build up in her tummy.  I sometimes put my babies pacifier in the freezer for a minute, and then she takes it better.  She is only 12 weeks old, but she likes the empty bottle thing too, and putting her binky in the freezer so that it "seems" different, is the only thing that works for me sometimes.|`|jHHMSTmEaa	she may still be hungry...but my daughter hates the pacifier and loves the bottle, so if i am sure she is full i put some warm water and let her drink that. If she needs it for comfort i would just let her have it for now. But sucking on it empty may make her a bit gassy.
ibeYAlwpaa	Most toddlers go through this stage at some point, severity varies.  Ignoring it is really the best policy. Its REALLY hard though, but its important to not give in to the fits. Also is the child alone with the mom constantly? Like my little cousin was like that && it made him seem like a bad kid but mostly it was because he wasnt socialized properly, its kind of a problem that SAHM's run into. Maybe take him around other people more like other children, or like once a week have someone else take him for awhile (if Possible).|`|PeEIuzP5aa	it means that he thinks that his mom is not coming back and he needs to be told hay im just going to the bathroom come see, let him in the bathroom with you so he can see, if that don't help try mom is going to bed want to come too. just keep trying simple things and he should come around.<br>  good luck<br>  P.S. don't get mad at him, its not his fault.|`|2Z00M2Qvaa	This is so normal for his age. The best thing to do is when you are leaving, make the good-bye process as brief as possible. Another thing is to have the parent/parents have more night outs without the child so that way he starts to get use to them leaving.<br>  A very good website to  go to with more helpful tip is  ehow.com|`|PqCpZp90aa	She should read up on "attachment theory" (Mary Ainsworth, John Bowlby) it sounds like the child does not have a secure attachment.<br>  You have to make him feel secure in his environment, he hasn't learned to regulate his own emotions yet. Good Luck!!|`|AA12041870	That is typical behavior for a child that age.  The only thing that will change the behavior is time.|`|FTFd3AQAaa	sounds like typical separation anxiety, she will likely just need to wait it out.... of course she could talk to his doctor if she thinks it's too extreme or goes on too long

Always have been and always will be. It's not about the weight. I would try the metformin  for longer because it definitely worked for me. I'm almost 18 weeks now, so good luck!

PEGWnd5kaa	Truth is this a grey area in abortion law. There have been cases of doctors contacting authorities if they suspect a self-induced abortion.  Doctors are sometimes under threat of loss of medical license if they do not report incidence of harm of self or harm of others to the police.

Wade[12] made abortion more readily available throughout the U.S., it remains a crime in most jurisdictions for a woman to attempt to perform an abortion on herself. In May 2005, Gabriela Flores - a Mexican immigrant living in South Carolina - was charged under such a statute, which carried a maximum penalty of two years in prison. She had induced abortion by ingesting misoprostol, an ulcer medication with abortifacient potential. Mississippi classifies self-induced abortions as deaths which affect the public interest, requiring that physicians report them to the local medical examiner.  By contrast, New Mexico's "Unborn Victims of Violence Act" exempts self-induced abortion from the criminal liability the act creates."<br>  <br>  Police have been known to do autopsy on the fetus to determine cause of death:<br>  <a href="http://www.eagletribune.com/punews/local_story_026120317" rel="nofollow">http://www.eagletribune.com/punews/local...</a><br>  <br>  However, case law has held that laws against performing abortion are designed to prosecute individuals who are practicing medicine without a license, not women who are attempting to self-induce, no matter how late or how violently:<br>  <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/us/legalcenter/Story?id=2585102&page=1" rel="nofollow">http://abcnews.go.com/us/legalcenter/Sto...</a><br>  <br>  Largely, the degree of legal risk in telling your doctor is related to the state laws governing fetal homicide:<br>  <a href="http://www.ncsl.org/programs/health/fethom.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.ncsl.org/programs/health/feth...</a>|`|wiAVa1H5aa	Nope, but they can detect that you miscarried (terminated) and/or if you have a uterine infection or retained tissue.   Doctors only care about your health, they aren't cops nor are they going to prosecute unless abuse of another is involved.   Be straightforward with your doctor please!   They are only concerned about your health.|`|Bw1h5xAcaa	No. There is no evidence of any kind of early abortion unless there was significant scarring of the uterus after a D&C, which almost never happens.|`|o2YHnKXiaa	I would hope you didn't do this........
wnQRhfczaa	Generally if you get your period it means you are not pregnant. Your next period (if you are not pregnant) should be around a month later but this will not necessarily be a calendar month - it depends on your cycle. For example, my cycle is 35 days which means I tend to only get 11 a year.<br>  <br>  Some women do experience bleeding during pregnancy which they think is their period. If you think this might be the case then I would suggest you take a home pregnancy test to make sure.|`|oo3R4fVBaa	it is possible i guess, but very doubtful. im sure you should be expecting your period around the same time this month!|`|fPmN2RQEaa	Read this, yet Based on my watch your starting during the freak days that which is before the new moon or full moon. Still your location is likely not the same as mine. Thus out of balance to much stress usually i would bet on March 18th. read on!<br>  <br>  I had to fake it, as I wasn't ready to have another child yet. <br>  On another note, I still think the moon has everything to do with this.<br>  Put your zip code in this and go to Feeding Times tab.<br>  <br>   <a href="http://www.bigfishtackle.com/weather/index.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.bigfishtackle.com/weather/ind...</a><br>  <br>  Ok for some reason the site bigfishtackle.com is not working the way I am use to so some alternatives are. <br>  <br>  When the moon either is coming up in the east or setting in the west this is one-hour bite. Then when the moon is one hour before straight over-head to one hour past directly overhead is 2 hour with it at your feet 12 1/2 hours later is again 2-hour bite.<br>  <br>  <br>  Another is a watch called Casio Pathfinder you must know your GMT Greenwich mean time, and longitude & Latitude ordinances to set the watch and must allow for DLS day light savings.<br>  <br>  There is what I call freak days as this occurs five days before the new and full moon for two consecutive days. <br>  See if it is accurate for the times, you both wake up unassisted, eat, fall asleep and get busy.<br>  You will be amassed; but know that I have found there to be a half hour in between each set of times. The minor is good for 1 hour and the major is good for 2 hours being the time shown is the start time.<br>  <br>  Not to gross you out or anything, so on a personal note; we wanted to have a boy so here is what I believe. When we would go at it; I considered the first shot to be the girls as our first-born was a girl and I remember how it went in detail that time. <br>  <br>  So I figured then the second shot must be boys as for me girls on the left and boys on the right so, I would do the deed and pull out then after about 10 min. go again so as to say cleaning house and the second time was the charm. Within 5 weeks, we knew. He is now four years old and I would not have changed a thing. As by following the So-lunar schedule, I could tell when he wanted to eat and fall asleep or when he would wake up. Then we would go fishing every time he say’s he's hungry as first the little ones come in then the big ones then it repeats one more time usually I will catch upwards of 16 fish at a time UFB.<br>  <br>  Of course, you should consult the doctor what is going or try the other. Read through the other site listed and search for others, but use the first one to save you money on a So lunar schedule.|`|rvFqdocjaa	You never know !!!<br>  <br>  try a pregnancy test|`|TQYaNGdSaa	You are not pregnant and you will have another period march the 14 th

lRq81lu7aa	Sounds like your little one is teething.  My daughter is 8 months with one tooth and she was exactly how your son was yesterday.  She would cry, then be alright, and then cry a little more.  She didn't nap very long yesterday and went to bed really early.<br>  <br>  Give him a cold teething ring to see if he chews on it.  Go ahead and hold him, they need extra comfort when they are teething.  Ask your pediatrician if you can give him a little baby Tylenol, that may help, but it may make him more sleepy.  <br>  <br>  I feel your pain, but this is when extra care and lots of patience are needed.  If he cries too much and you can't handle it ask someone to come over for a bit, maybe the distraction will help and help you with his crying.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|MUVdG9n1aa	You may have to wait it out. If you think he has tummy issues try gripe water... you can find it at most pharmacies, I give it to my son when he spits up curdled milk and cries and it helps right away. Otherwise just hold him... I know it's tiring but they're only this small for a very little while and you can't spoil a little baby. Also some babies are fascinated with their tongues.. mine is, he sticks it out all the time.|`|NxxpFJOAaa	ii don't have kids but my sister is a teenage mom so ii know a lot about babies and ii love em so yeah.. but if he wants to be held all the time, then when he falls asleep lay him down and put like a rolled up blanket by his back or something so it feels like he's being held then put one of your shirts that your wore the night before by him so he smells your scent.. it might just work. && about the teething my niece is 4 months and she has a tooth so maybe|`|xApAWlshaa	not me i dont have a child but i think.the problem is........(DRUM ROLL PLEASE)...........................he just loves you|`|FsmcCXlvaa	I suspect it's teething but the jel may not be working well enough. Have you tried Hyland's teething tablets? They worked great for my kids and you can find them just about anywhere; grocery store, Target, etc. On the really bad days I'd give a little Tylenol or Motrin and that helps as well. If he's not himself than there is something going on. Try the tablets and see if it helps. If his mouth hurts he isn't going to want to eat or stimulate his mouth at all. If the tablets and Tylenol don't work I'd talk to the doctor again.

Wjdpm4xNaa	how cute! I love chubby babies haha.  My son is also a little chubber!  He's 7 months and weighs 24lbs.  He is usually bigger than babies his age.  I too thought chubby babies were the norm...but I see babies his age so much skinnier than him all the time.  I don't think a chubby or a skinny baby decides whether they are healthy or not.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	Among healthy full term breastfed babies who are fed on demand, and who have mothers who are healthy and well nourished and were healthy and well nourished during pregnancy there is a wide range of amount of fat on the baby (chubbiness), wide range of normal weights (regardless of chubbiness), and a wide range of normal heights.<br>  <br>  Because breastfeeding is the norm, by definition a wide range of types of babies are normal and its usually genetic to a large extend whether a baby is chubby, just like it is generally genetic whether baby, child or adult is tall or not.  Of course nutrition plays a part in malnourished populations (which is why people tend to have gotten taller more rapidly than genetic changes can account for in the last 100 year)<br>  <br>  Formula fed babies tend to have more body fat, but some formula fed babies aren't as fat because of digestive problems.  <br>  <br>  Moms who have an over production of milk (usually related to hormones and diet assuming mom is nursing frequently enough) and babies with reflux also tend to be fatter or skinnier because they either overeat or undereat because of discomfort.<br>  <br>  So healthy babies can be fat or skinny, and minor problems can also make baby fatter or skinnier than their genes normally would make them.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	My son has really chubby cheeks, which tend to make people assume he's chubby all over.  A chubby baby is not necessarily a healthy baby, but a skinny baby isn't necessarily a healthy baby either.  A healthy baby is a healthy baby.|`|CVdcrY3kaa	I think any baby can be a healthy baby, chubby or skinny. My daughter has chubby cheeks and thighs, but overall she's in the 50% for height/weight. She's 7 months and around 19 or 20lbs.|`|GCPbKg9Eaa	Babys come in all sizes my son was 23 lbs and 28 inches at 6 months which put him in the 98%tile for baby boys his age!<br>  <br>  I love when he gets chubby..usually shortly after he will have a growth spurt and not be so chubby. Now that he is 10 months and walking he doesnt chub up as much. He weighs 25lbs and is 30 inches now.<br>  <br>  I know how you feel though. My friends 13 month old boy is way skinnier and smaller then my son. but he is in the 40% tile for his age.(but that doesnt mean hes unhealthy)<br>  <br>  The doctor will always let you know if there is an issue of being to skinny or to chubby!<br>  <br>  Enjoy your chubby bub!! at least you know hes healthy!!|`|yoNXldH8aa	Well if your baby is unhealthy then mine is a huge porker. lol He's only 7 weeks and weighs 14 lbs. He's only 22" but he was a big baby to begin with. A friend of mines baby is a month older than mine and her baby weighs only 8.5 lbs. My family and my husbands are all big boned anyway so if your pediatrician says she's good then she's good.|`|lnsOJ3GBaa	There's really not a norm.

Good Luck to you Enjoy her and God Bless.|`|115I5Polaa	My daughter has really chubby cheeks!  But she is skinny all over.  She is 3 1/2 months old and weighs 13 pounds and is 26 inches long.

My doctor said a chubby baby is a healthy baby and because he is 100% breastfed, I am not overfeeding. My brother's wife had one chubby one and one skinny one, both healthy. I think it's genetic!|`|Y7xlBWdsaa	Your baby doesn't have to be chubby to be healthy. All babies are built differently.  You have a long baby. My baby at 9mos was that long. Now at 11mos, I don't see a difference.|`|qMYbGqiwaa	My daughter was 19lbs 6ozs, 27inches at her 6 month appointment, so it sounds like they are about the same size- and my daughter does look chubby!  But they are just babies so don't worry- once she starts crawling she will thin down.|`|Vl7trXXraa	not necessarily. An active baby is an healthy baby.|`|AA11210211	I have had average/slender babies.My daughter is 1 yr and weighs 15 lbs,she was only 4.5 at birth so...My son is 3 1/2 and weighs 30 lbs.|`|pXSKSS3daa	A chubby baby doesn't always constitute a healthy baby and a skinny baby doesn't always equal an underfed/unhealthy baby. Babies grow at different rates and as long as they are following a good growth pattern then it doesn't matter what they look like.<br>  <br>  At 6 months my son weighed 19 lbs. Now at 11 months he weighs 22-23 lbs. and is about 30 inches. He has never looked chubby to us, but I guess that's because his height was always in proportion with his weight.
jqYpMCXmaa	waterbirth has got to be better for you because for one its not injecting a needle into ur spine and two - the water is hot so it calms ur contractions and relieves strong pains - just like hot water bottles.|`|rAD0mL7Saa	yes. you'll love it. my experiences and what it was like are at <a href="http://www.philsdomain.net" rel="nofollow">http://www.philsdomain.net</a> you don't need pain meds and you won't feel pain if you put the preparation in|`|cxcDP97qaa	If you are worried about pain, look up a chiropractic method called "Basic" or "Logan Basic Method".  They are doing a lot of research on this right now but from the results I've seen, very few woman tore and the tears were pretty small at that, MOST didn't use pain meds, and the longest labor was 6 hours, shortest has been 15 minutes (these both being first borns as well).  <br>  <br>  I just wanted to address your pain issue, so maybe then you can have your water birth if you can't have an epidural and with this way, you know the pain would be much less. <br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK :)

44ccf078ecbbb80711e26204438034abaa	OH yes! You can get poisoned basically from it. That is one of the things you shouldn't ever try and take a bunch of. Iron can kill you if there is too much in your blood... Heck there is a disease that is like that and you have to get dialysis if you have that. <br>  <br>  Ask your doctor about how many MG of iron you should be getting and don't take more than that. <br>  <br>  Best case if you take to much iron you'll mess up your stomach and cause constipation.|`|IFDfpbFJaa	Yes. You can. Google it and you'll find lots of information about too much iron and possible over doses.|`|wiAVa1H5aa	Yes there is such as thing as too much iron, men suffer from it all the time.  Women rarely get too much iron, we loose iron through menstruation, birthing and lactation.   Our needs are more then twice what a man's is, 18mg/day instead of their 8mg/day!   So with our lower caloric intake we need much much higher iron levels, so we are often a little low.|`|AA11109728	Yes, there is such a thing as having too much iron.  It caused pains for me when I took too much (at the advice of my doctor, no less - no, they don't always know what's best!).  If you are not pregnant and just looking to add some extra iron to your diet, eat Total cereal.  It has 100% of the daily value of iron, as well as a lot of other things.  That helped boost my iron levels when I needed to and it's something simple you can do.|`|yPNvecc7aa	Well i don't know if there are serious repercussions, however I know that too much iron can constipate you and that is no fun!<br>  <br>  I would consult my doctor before taking any supplements.|`|AA11280073	Yes, and it is a known cancer causer. Never take any supplement without your Dr's approval.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	Yes, even a small amount of extra iron has been shown to have health impacts and many of the symptoms of too little iron are the same as too much iron.<br>  <br>  If you feel you need more iron use real food, which has a lower chance of causes excess because the body doesn't absorb/digest as much iron when iron levels are normal/high.<br>  <br>  The USDA has set the upper safe level at 45mg for ALL adult; including pregnant women.

However, a pregnant woman's blood volume expands around 40-60%; this blood volume expansion reduces the concentration of red blood cells and iron in her blood, which is what's measured by hematocrit and hemoglobin.<br>  The best pregnancy outcomes are associated with the lowest hematocrit/hemoglobin. It turns out that 9.5 is optimal. This isn't because pregnant women don't need iron; it's because healthy pregnant women have large increases in blood volume that lower the hematocrit/hemoglobin.<br>  So, in fact, a woman who's having problems with her pregnancy and doesn't have an increasing blood volume will have higher h/h levels than a healthy woman.<br>  There are better ways of assessing anemia in pregnancy; fatigue is a clue, but the best way to assess how well your blood is carrying oxygen is to look for pallor in the gums and under eyelids and to assess capillary refill when you apply pressure to the nailbed. .”<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.hindawi.com/GetArticle.aspx?d..." rel="nofollow">http://www.hindawi.com/GetArticle.aspx?d...</a><br>  “Despite significantly elevated hepatic iron stores after iron supplementation in pregnant rats this had no significant effect upon blood haemoglobin or transferring saturation levels. However the mean weight of the foetuses at Day 20-21 was significantly lower than that of the non-supplemented pregnant rats. Iron supplements significantly increased the activity of NADPH oxidase in the maternal alveolar macrophages, the primary event in the formation of the phagolysosome to combat invading organisms. However inducible nitric oxide synthase activity was significantly reduced in these macrophages as shown by decreases in LPSinduced and LPS+IFN,-induced NOS activation. Iron supplementation to rats of normal iron status at the commencement of pregnancy did not show any beneficial effects to either the foetus or the mother.”<br>  <br>  Iron suppleme.ntation of pregnant individuals with adequate iron status may aggravate oxidative stress [Lachili et al., 2001], with the potential for oxidation of lipids and DNA [Schill and Reilly<br>  2000], a factor which could contribute to preterm delivery,<br>  <br>  Iron supplements to rats which have normal iron status at the commencement of pregnancy appear to induce toxicity in both the mother- a reduced immune function as well as to the offspring- reduced birth weight.|`|O97ZoHGXaa	iron tablets arn't as recommended any more. its better to take spar-tone.<br>  it's liquid in a sache and is best absorbed into the blood with orange juicethats what i took after pregnancy and my HB went right back up to 13.7!|`|6xwdFvdpaa	yes you can have too much iron, my advise would be eating food that contains iron like fish and nuts|`|mn8tFuhoaa	yes if you have alot it could cause liver damage..
BcdbR6iSaa	When making this choice, personally, I wouldn't worry about the guy. In the end, it doesn't matter if he's going to be there. I know plenty of single moms, and yes they have it rough, but you can do it.<br>  That baby will be the greatest thing to ever happen to you. I have a 6 month old, and I can't believe how much I miss her when I'm not with her. Baby's can be a pain sometimes, but it's all soooo worth it. <br>  Ultimately it's up to you, but my opinion is, if you're having thoughts of keeping the baby, that's what you should do. You don't want to live your life with regrets. <br>  <br>  Good Luck!!!|`|ftvxAS3saa	i did the RU 486 pill i think thats what its called i forgot, i was 6 weeks an 5 days i loved the father but he didnt love me an he told me if i was to have the abortion he would be with me forever which was bullshytttttt we broke up a month later!! but yeah if u think its the right thing to do then its your choice no one elses.<br>  <br>  im pregnant now an i love the father an he loves me!! the pill is veryyyyy painful just know that!  keep your self safe! listen to what your heart desires|`|ROJans2Taa	you cant take the pill now anyways, it's only a viable option before you actually conceive and I don't know him, so I cant say, it's your choice in the end, not his anyways, im prolife so naturally id be against it, but if you feel it's the best course of action then have an abortion, you'll need to go to a clinic.<br>  <br>  ADDED INFO - my mistake if you are referring to a specific pill other then plan b, I live in Canada and have never heard of it, when I had my D&C due to blighted ovum, had a pill but still was required to get surgical assistance since it dosnt gaurentee full results and I was only 6 weeks when they disovered the problem.|`|T48smu01aa	I dunno try praying.....everyone on here will either say don't abort its your own fault in other will say its your choice they will call you mean names and so on.....my advice is pray about if you believe n god ask him what you should do and give it a couple days.....its your choice I wish it wasn't your choice and you had to keep it b/c I am against abortion but hunny its up too you think about it you know whats best for you think of what will happen if you don't take that pill and then think about what will happen if you do take the pill think about the future when you think about both of those....<br>  Good luck and if you keep it congrats!!<br>  Ps.if you keep it congrats and it will honestly will be hard but worth everything :)|`|uFrqC4Y2aa	There isn't such thing as an abortion pill. There's only Plan B which is only effective for 72 hours after you had sex. Plan B doesn't allow your egg to attach to the uterus wall.|`|AA11380378	It's too late for the Plan B pill. You need an abortion (or carry to term).<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|ZSSUfSXwaa	There are a lot of women out there who are raising their babies ALONE because the baby's father didnt care etc...<br>  but why KILL the baby? If he's not going to be around and you DONT WANT OR CANT look after the baby, either way is fine... give him/her up for adoption! <br>  Of course he was pushing towards abortion.. you just said he's psycho?? And he doesnt care... he doesnt want to deal with child support or the responsibility of being a father and you guys arent together so he couldnt care less. <br>  But then again he is not the one carrying a BABY inside, yes it is a baby.. why killing the baby in a horrible way ?? <br>  JUST DONT. Give the baby up for adoption, really. There a lot of couples out there who would want nothing more than having a baby but cant -just be responsible you had sex unprotected now be responsible!! Just have this baby!!! <br>  You can for sure give him up and allow him to have a life, with wonderful loving parents-adoptive parents...|`|6NS3UUaQaa	There IS a pill version for an abortion that you can take in the comfort of your own home it is pretty pain full and will be alone but alot of women prefer it instead of having the actual procedure. I say do what is right for you at this moment in your life because that is what matters now.|`|5RvTXdmUaa	Nothing wrong with abortions, it's your choice. Make sure you REALLY think about it first though. You do need to stop thinking about what HE'S going to think. Make the decision that YOU want. Would you want to raise this child alone, with him completely out of the picture? If you think you could, then keep the baby.|`|d2f7cf7b1ececf8bdff4c13b656be711aa	I think you should take the pill, he doesnt seem supportive and you will always be on your own.  It is way to hard to do it with two parents you will be stuck by yourself.  I dont think he will even care if you do.  I think it is your best choice.  Good luck.|`|2ObqoJbKaa	I think that you should make whatever decision is best for you. Don't worry about what will or won't upset him. Its your baby, your body, your decision. Just follow your heart, and do what you think is best. good luck.|`|r7q8LW7Aaa	Why ask a question as personal as that on here then say, 'don't judge'.<br>  We don't know him, we don't know you.<br>  Of course you're gonna get rude comments.<br>  Jeez...|`|r7dYHFLtaa	Do whatever is best for YOU and your BABY !<br>  <br>  Good luck !|`|TX9igTWraa	either way it's your choice. do what's best for you|`|3e7KFOXmaa	I wish I could just ignore the "no rude comments" but I can't. Take this however you like. Regardless of who the dad is and how he is, you're killing a innocent human. Think about it,that little baby that is inside of you may grow up to one day be the one that finds the cure to cancer or some other terrible disease. Why do you care so much what he thinks anyways, since he won't be around and such? It's you that has to live with the decision that you make not him. I know people who have done this and live with regret years later. Do you want to do that? No, I don't think it's a smart move.|`|jrOISaj4aa	It's all up to you. You would carry this baby in your belly and in the end, whether he wanted to support him/her, he has to. I'm currently 36 weeks pregnant and went through some rough decisions in the beginning but I'm glad I'm about to give birth to my daughter. Have you even considered, maybe, adoption? It's your personal decision so you do what you feel is right hun, don't listen to him, or anyone else.|`|zoAqdu1Jaa	Ms holli- you are incorrect, it is called a medical abortion. You are talking about planB<br>  <br>  Jackie- You are also incorrect. Geez, people! Get your facts straight.. Look up medical abortion...Gosh that ticks me off<br>  <br>   Anyway, I think that you should do what you feel is best. You know what is right and wrong for your future. I think as long as you have thought it through, then you are making the right decision for you either way.<br>  <br>   Best of luck and Im sorry you have to go through this|`|mOQqrp4paa	you should have done the plan b after you had sex with him since he's such a psycho. but since you didn't do what you think is right like you said he will never be around but then again you can get tons of benefits from him for the child from the government with him being in the marines. so you might not need him to be there just money wise. but i strongly believe a child needs a mother and a father not one he sees every now and then. he'll be able to do whatever and you wont. and any army, marine, air force whatever they're all psycho men and whores. (only judging from the ones i know personally) all they want is sex and half of them are usually married|`|nFsM4VPTaa	Hello there. I am in the same boat you are in. In about an hour and a half I have to take my second dose which induces the cramping and bleeding. I decided not to carry to term because the father does not have himself together. We were talking the other day and I realize he's not the ideal person to father MY child. When I told him at first he didn't believe me. Then he became very selfish, wanting me to keep the baby because it would make him a better person. I don't believe having a baby will make you a better person. I just gave birth six months ago and didn't and did not plan to have another so soon. Do what you feel is right for you. Now a days finances are low and it is very hard to support a family. The father of my other two children is incarcerated and I am doing pretty good raising our two girls on my own.<br>  God knows your heart and made it possible for you do afford to take care of this situation. But believe me I will NEVER do this again, BIRTH CONTROL is my next step, and if this happens again I will carry to term because I don't believe that termination is a form of birth control<br>  Hope this helps and GOOD LUCK.
Ew2wC9piaa	you could try Similac Alimentum that is what we had to use for our son and now we are trying to wean him to milk but it has to be lactose free because he is allergic<br>  <br>  <br>  also when i was nursing him he would spit up all the time and than still be hungry i am guessing it was the milk in my system. he too had a poor latch no matter how many times we tried with all the help out there it was just better for him to be on the formula.<br>  <br>  one of my younger brothers were lactose intolerant when he was younger and now my youngest sister is having problems with the lactose in milk and she is 5 years old and never had a problem before.<br>  <br>  <br>  also do not let people make you feel bad because you nursed the first 2 and not this one. you are the mommy and you know best.|`|JXHy2EHQaa	You could try re-lactating :)  <br>  (Weak sucking is no reason to give formula--if she could suck formula by a bottle, she could have sucked breastmilk).  <br>  Breastmilk is awesome for constipation.<br>  If she was a preemie, is it possible that her digestive system is just immature, or there might be a real issue?<br>  There are formulas for babies with milk allergies, but they aren't cheap.<br>  You could try a no-iron formula too, and make sure it's being mixed exactly right---using proper liquid measuring cups for the water.  It's easy to get a little lazy and use the lines on bottles, but they aren't accurate.<br>  My husband still makes horrible noises when he poops :)|`|lnsOJ3GBaa	Could you try pumping and feeding her from a bottle? It might help and the last thing you want is for your child to develope digestive problems at such an early age.<br>  <br>  Also, at 6 months she should be able to get most of what she needs from other food options as well.<br>  <br>  Good Luck to you and God Bless|`|sfn7RP1yaa	have you tried the formula called Nutramigen? My 7 year old was the same way as a baby and that worked for us! and make sure you have the correct bottles that dont allow in air! good luck|`|iPEv1lRBaa	At six months I assume you've started her on solids.  Have you tried prunes?|`|mf3OOagMaa	Relax! That is the first thing that you need to do - you are not doing anything wrong. I have 4 children - 2 with dairy allergies all four were on Soy formula. Their constipation could be caused from a lot of different reasons. If you can't find it at the store - look for it online - but get your baby some "Gripe Water" from the maker: Wellements (see link below). We call it magic medicine - it works wonders on a lot of tummy troubles - even for adults! It is a little pricey - but worth every penny!  I know there are other makers of Gripe Water - but I do not know how well that they work. I know Wellements version works and its organic, so it not filled with chemicals - bonus!<br>  If your baby is already eating cereals / baby food - try incorporating cereals with apricots or prunes in it...this will help a lot! Your baby is probably "plugged" because of the increase of iron (in the soy formula) and the lack of fiber in the diet. The Gripe Water does not provide fiber, but does help move things in a positive direction! Try giving the Gripe Water daily until you are introducing more fiber into the diet. Be prepared though, cause often by the first dose (sometimes by the second or 3rd) they will begin to move and the first diapers will be full! Good luck!
28baa97a0d6383dd30466a3e19482da2aa	Something I did with mine is combined leg exercises with mommy play time. I would lay them on their back take hold of their feet and gently play with them. I would sing a funny little song and have them doing kicks to the beat and move their legs like they were bicycling. Pull their legs out straight the push them back up. Eventually they would start pushing against my hands, but more importantly they loved it and would giggle their little heads off the whole time. A toy that she could kick at and get a reaction would be good too. Don't sweat it though, every baby is different and love to do things in their own time. I have two that were lazy like your daughter and they walked just fine when it was time. Relax and enjoy some play time. ;) Maybe she won't catch on. LOL  HTH|`|jhPlVj0oaa	Seriously, you don't need to do anything..and you do need to be careful that you don't put unnecessary pressure on her legs.  In a few months you'll be wishing she wasn't moving around so much - trust me...when she's pulling cereal boxes out of the cupboards or heading towards a staircase, you'll be thinking...aah! stay still.  The most I ever did was (when i was playing with them) put my hands at the base of their feet and get them to push them away, that sort of thing will help to build muscle in the legs.  As long as she is doing lots of kicking and thrashing around then she'll be grand.|`|IDS64Eh8aa	She is still very young, some babies want to use their legs at this age, some don't. Give her time|`|MUVdG9n1aa	Just keep trying... maybe try a door jumper. My son loves that he can push off the floor and jump|`|FLpMShKNaa	It may be a bit young to worry. Its hard, I overthink things myself, but try and relax and enjoy her. :)|`|JXHy2EHQaa	It's way too early to worry!!!!!   A baby's developmental timeline is so quick anyway---helpless blob on day one, walking by 12 months.  So much happens in that time it doesn't matter if at 4 months she dangles her feet in the exersaucer.  The dangling position of those seats isn't good either because it puts their pelvis in a position that's not normal for infants, and puts all their weight on their pelvis.<br>  Babies develop in a certain order for a biological reason.  The legs are the LAST to develop strenght, because they are the last to be needed.  You don't want a six month old walking, LOL.  She KNOWS she doesn't need to use her legs yet, so she is focussing on the developmental experiences that she needs for right now.  Let her be a baby!
ds5MCdS5aa	Do you think it would be easier to have a child with birth defects, or deal with the abortion?  I am pro choice, btw, so I believe FIRMLY that it is your, and your significant others choice to make.  If you are really, truly, against abortion, then by all means, don't make a decision you can't live with.  If, however, the prospect of having a child with potentially life threatening birth defects is too much for you, than maybe you should consider the alternatives......Talk with your spouse and your Dr. in length, look at everything rationally, and decide what would be best for you, and your child.  Good Luck!|`|IFDfpbFJaa	If I knew earlier enough then yes, but I'm against abortions after about 7 or 8 weeks. I don't think I even got the downs syndrom test until I was 18 weeks and that's far too late for me to have an abortion. I could never live with myself if I had a partial abortion....no way.|`|ROJans2Taa	I found out that my daughter had an increased risk for spina bifida when I was pregnant and they told me I still had "options" I never went for the amnio because I wasn't going to abort anyway, she is 7 and healthy. I have never been in another situation where they thought my baby was going to have a serious defect, I would hope id want to keep it regardless since im pro life, but ive learned until your in a certain situation you have no idea what you would do. do alot of research and see your odds and outcomes, best luck|`|iXSoX6Rnaa	It'd be hard to get an abortion period. You start to love your baby once you find out your pregnant. I would keep the baby no matter what. It's not fair and kind of selfish to go and kill the baby because he/she might not be like everyone else. It's easier for to say since my daughter and son are health. It's really a personal decision that you can make. Good Luck hun and hopefully your babies okay.|`|Bw1h5xAcaa	I couldn't make that decision until I knew for sure the exact extent of the disability through extensive testing. But if the defect was severe (incompatible with life), I probably would go through with it and have an abortion.|`|zSABr7praa	I wouldn't.  My sister had an amnio done because the doctor thought her babies legs looked short.  The test came back that put her child odds for having downs syndrome very high.  She worried her entire pregnancy, had a dangerous invasive procedure..for nothing.  Her baby doesn't have downs.  I don't know why the doctors even tell women there's a chance.  There's a chance for a million different birth defects but it's still YOUR baby... <br>  The test aren't always accurate.. and to answer your question, no I wouldn't abort.  It doesn't matter what "defects" it may or may not have (I didn't have any test done).. it's still mine and my husbands baby.|`|d2f7cf7b1ececf8bdff4c13b656be711aa	I would have to say if the child had a chance of never living a normal life.  I would have the abortion. No matter what it is your choice, but think about your future and and childs.|`|eU5Eth2aaa	I would keep the baby.<br>  <br>  Why would a mother terminate the pregnancy just because they couldn't stand the thought of having a perfect child?|`|r7dYHFLtaa	That's a Very PERSONAL Question !<br>  That only the parents of that unborn child should discuss !|`|iWUAWkNNaa	I wouldn't abort.|`|10b1R3ibaa	No, there is that chance that the baby will come out perfectly healthy and amazing and you would regret it forever if you had the abortion, in my opinion.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, if you find out at fifteen weeks that the baby would definately be born with birth defects, and personally, although I am pro-life, in that situation I would have an abortion. Although the legal limit is 24 weeks, if there is a risk to the mother's life or 'there are foetal abnormalities' there is no time limit.<br>  <br>  My daughter, Anna, 5, had a 50% chance of being born with severe downs syndrome, which we found out at 34 weeks along. Too late then- we had her, and she is perfect. I hope that your baby is fine too.|`|7jXChfBNaa	me personally i wouldn't have an abortion. i was told when i was 10 weeks pregnant that i tested positive for cystic fibrosis. the dr asked me if the father tested positive too if i would want to get an amnio done to see if the baby could have it and i said no. it was a very tough time for me and i had a lot to think about but then the end result i decided that no matter what my baby could be born with it is still my baby and i would have to live with the fact that i never gave my child the chance at life. so to me i was looking at it as if i abort the baby then i would have never known if they would have had any disorder or how bad it would have been. or i could keep the baby and chance it anyway and for myself i would know that i did the right thing at giving the baby life anyways. good luck to you hun and i hope that helps a little. sorry that was really long.|`|jBdvUQEXaa	I am 5 wks pregnant as well. I have three small children already, and I have had this discussion with my partner.

I would never abort a baby and so there is no sense learning whether or not my child has a disability in advance.  The tests are not always 100% accurate anyways.<br>  <br>  God gave me a baby for a reason, and I will carry it to full term by my choice.  I would never abort a baby because he/she doesn't meet my guidelines for being perfect.  Every baby is perfect in God's eyes.<br>  <br>  Maybe the purpose of you or your baby is to educate people on the risks of this medication... who knows.  Everything happens for a reason.|`|Uj9Wi1WVaa	Hi, I'm extremely sorry you are going through this stressful period.<br>  <br>  Having had to discuss the option of abortion with my first child, my experience is that I would have every test available before making that decision.<br>  <br>  For those who don't have the tests because they wouldn't have an abortion.....why not have the tests so you are prepared? If I didn't have the tests, my daughter would most likely have died soon after birth. It allowed the relevant medical staff to be on standby.|`|tnOZ49JQaa	I don't know if your a Christian or not, but if you pray God will help you through this and give you direction. If you have this baby it may be perfectly healthy,
GGH0HVdvaa	Yeah but what can you do, yenno? It was her decision to take fertility drugs and have a buttload of kids when she already had kids to begin with.<br>  <br>  And you can't fault the doc on this either because if he was to refuse to help her get pregnant based on the fact that she already had kids, she could have sued him because of discrimination or whatever else. And now that she has a buttload of kids and hardly any means to take care of them, the doctor can still be sued for giving her those treatments. Poor guy, it's a lose-lose for him, and all those children have to live in a struggling environment.|`|hKJIDdVqaa	I think a lot of parents are unfair to their children. As I am sure alot of people think I am unfair to mine.  Good thing it is not up to me to decide what is right and wrong for others.

TiW72sAUaa	I have a 2 yr old daughter, when she was 1 day old I found a lump in her neck, I was beside myself. I mentioned it to my doctor 3 times before he took me serious. He referred her to the hospital to have it looked at.<br>  <br>  In was absolutely terrified. The consultant said it was a lymph node which was working overtime to clear up her eczema. She still has the lump now and he said it will probably never go and end up as scar tissue.<br>  <br>  Hope this puts your mind at rest a little, if you really are concerned take her to see your GP.|`|FLEXqVoiaa	It's a swollen gland/lymph node. Your child may be getting sick, or she's sick already. Nodes can also swell a few days after an illness, or they can swell for no reason, or while teething, etc. It's good to get it checked out to make sure the node isn't swollen for any serious reason.|`|q4rG5Dwtaa	My 8 year old had bad allergies, he always had ear infections, sinus problems etc. when he was a baby. He had little glands in his neck when he would get sick, its sometimes a sign of some sort of infection. Just bring it up next time you go to your doctor. Good Luck.|`|6lyvhRLsaa	My son is fine and I noticed that kind of lump a few months ago.<br>  <br>  Try not to panic, it might be nothing!|`|KKK9caZFaa	Lymph nodes feel just like that and they swell up at times of infection, eg sore throat or perhaps a mouth ulcer or even a mild skin infection.  <br>  <br>  Saying that my eldest son had three enlarged lymph nodes on the back of his neck for well over a year with no infection.|`|lYZ71zYAaa	normal|`|bdc81a350221a05348d3b5708b5daa86aa	Its normal for babies to have that - my grand daughter had one and doc said nothing to worry about as its something to do with glands|`|e6jrBORRaa	My son had this.

PFJ7ZbVZaa	Well, right now my 7 month old is just really starting to get into the solids, so he has lunch and dinner and then breastfeeds about 5-6 times a day at least.  Soon he will have breakfast too.  I have a pretty lenient schedule for him, 7:30-8am wake up for the day, nurse, around 10am will be breakfast (solids), nurse, 10:30am-11:30am nap time (1-2 hours or so), nurse when wakes up, 2-2:30pm lunch time (solids), around 4pm nap time (45 minutes-1.5 hours-no real schedule here), nurse when wakes up, dinner around 5pm (solids) and then 7pm is bath time and 8pm is bedtime.  And if my kiddo wakes up anytime in the middle of the night I nurse him.  And he normally wakes up around 4:30am-5am to nurse and then goes back to sleep till 7:30am-8am.  That's our day!  Give and take a few nursing sessions! lol ;)  Like I said, it's not set in stone, it's just a ballpark for us to go off of so I have an idea.  %|`|LvbizUcwaa	An 7-8 month old should be eating solids 3 times a day. Baby cereal in the morning and then baby food for lunch and supper. and id say 3 bottles during the day as snacks. Kinda like if they eat at 7am then bottle around 9 or when hungry then lunch at 1130 or so then a bottle at  2 or so (before nap time) then supper around 5 or 6! then a bottle right before bedtime!!|`|IDS64Eh8aa	Between 7am-9pm usually 4x, she nurses at night also. She is offered solids 3x a day, every time I eat. Until last week she would only eat lunch and dinner, now she's interested in her breakfast too. She self-feeds.|`|eXsR8Gx5aa	my 7 mo old has three offerings of solids a day and around 6 breastfeeds usually|`|SNVauR3laa	I have to work, so she gets 2- four ounce bottles of expressed milk while I am at work, and nurses 5-6 more times. She gets other food usually twice per day, unless she is cranky while I am making dinner, then she will get a snack to hold her over.|`|CVdcrY3kaa	My daughter just started nursing every three hours, before this she ate every two hours. I offer her solids 3x a day, she usually only eats once or twice. She would rather self feed, so I try to offer a mixture of table foods and jarred food.
KICQQxLxaa	Unforunately, there are not any special plus size maternity stores around.  Some of the stores you listed have plus size maternity wear, but only online.<br>  <br>  Target has a small maternity department, with no plus size.  JcPenney carries a bunch of plus size maternity, but I believe only on-line.  I haven't seen any in the stores (granted, I haven't looked in over 2+ years!)<br>  <br>  The only store that I know carries it in the store is Motherhood Maternity, don't know what the current exchange rate is, so not sure if you would get a better deal getting it in the States instead of in Canada.<br>  <br>  I would have your parents check out Motherhood and JcPenney and see if they have any.<br>  <br>  On a side note, there is a FANTASTIC outlet mall in Orlando.  Lots of greats stores with some good deals.  Here is the website.  Have your parents check it out.<br>  <a href="http://www.premiumoutlets.com/outlets/outlet.asp?id=17" rel="nofollow">http://www.premiumoutlets.com/outlets/ou...</a><br>  <br>  ETA:  Mimi Maternity is now A Pea in the Pod.  They DO NOT carry any plus size maternity clothes now, only high end expensive stuff.  Like I want to spend $225 for a pair of 7 for mankind maternity jeans....<br>  <a href="http://www.apeainthepod.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.apeainthepod.com/</a>|`|pXSKSS3daa	Motherhood Maternity is a pretty neat store and they carry plus sized clothing. Old Navy also carries maternity clothing and some are plus sized. I'm not sure about JC Penny as I've never shopped there for maternity wear but Target has a slim selection.<br>  <br>  The clothing fit pretty spot on with my pre-pregnancy clothing. Meaning, I wore a large-extra large in tops pre-pregnancy and that's the size I got in maternity clothing.|`|0wTzlG2haa	Some of the Motherhood Maternity stores carry plus size stuff, but not all of them. It's worth  doing in internet search ahead of time. I bought a lot of my stuff (and I was in 16W and 18W or 1X size stuff prior to getting pregnant) at a Kohl's department store. I worked at a Kohl's at the time so I got a discount...plus I found that I really liked their stuff. I also bought several shirts and blouses in the plus size department. I'd get a shirt that was 2X or 3X and it would work great for me.|`|7rCeCVl2aa	MiMi Maternity has a great selection of plus sized maternity clothes. =)<br>  <br>  They also carry the secret fit belly brand. I used to LOVE the way they fit me. =)|`|oA8Rtyxuaa	motherhood maternity carries all sizes and it is specifically a maternity store. Babies r us, target, walmart also carry maternity clothes. Im not sure if department stores carry maternity clothes though.|`|43a27c0e1eef30eef2164c4c15242ab3aa	Def Target since you have motherhood and old navy already|`|T0gv52CDaa	Target carries plus sized maternity clothes, but not a lot, so your parents will have to go digging through the wracks.  Gap & Old Navy are where I got most of mine, but they only have the plus size stuff online, so you could order that for yourself and have it sent to you.  Motherhood & Mimi Maternity also have + size stuff, but not a great selection.|`|u1DDrXO2aa	Target is a good place...I also suggest highly motherhood ....you could actually get online and check it out!!! there is actually a link at the top that says motherhood canada..motherhoods clothing fit about the same as your regular clothing!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.motherhood.com/home.asp?Media=&referer=TypedIn&EntryPoint=Home" rel="nofollow">http://www.motherhood.com/home.asp?Media...</a>|`|LhV8D2Xeaa	I suggest Jcpenny and Target the have the cutest maternity clothes but Im not sure about plus sizes but i hope they would have them. Also ross has good maternity clothes|`|8026ec062aaa229b35c5aceb76a16035aa	I think walmart does carry some plus size maternity clothes, so does this place called Motherhood Maternity, you usually find them located in malls. Also, online Lane Bryant carries plus size maternity clothes.|`|B6Mfx5fUaa	Pea in a Pod has great maternity clothes, as well as Kohl's.  They both have websites you could check out.|`|bf6fb0f4caadf24cfa826edc2cc32d3baa	Motherhood Maternity has some cute stuff, but my wife found some really great tops at Kohl's.|`|xQofZDdNaa	I recommend Motherhood Maternity. They are a little more expensive, but they have the CUTEST Stuff...and it's SO comfortable! I wear it and I'm not pregnant. The plus size section is pretty much the same as the normal stuff. They also have other things like swim suites, bras, books etc. LOVE IT!!! Wal-mart does not have a great selection of maternity stuff, and it looks dumb honestly. If i were to go to a store like that I'd do Target.<br>  <br>  Lane Bryant is good, but no maternity stuff. Also Fashion Bug or Torrid is good for plus size. =)
FL67UPPHaa	9/10. I like it!<br>  <br>  Liliana is beautiful and feminine, and you could use the nickname Lily which is really sweet. Joy is a great alternative to "filler" virtue names like Hope and Grace, which are very popular now. I like the way you've combined a longer, flowing name with a short, simple one. I prefer the spelling Lilliana though.<br>  <br>  Congrats, btw! :)|`|tSEA42Uraa	If Liliana is pronounced Lily-on-uh, I love it.

I'm just not a fan of Liliana but believe me there are far worse.  I think you should go w/it.
qrfJ0ffiaa	Well as you know my daughter is 14months, and when she was about 8/9 months I thought i'd switch her around to face the other way, I did this for a few months (although you do check on them ALOT,lol) but then I read an article about how they did tests on babies that faced inwards facing their parents and babies that faced outwards and the outwards babies had development issues and emotional issues! I don't know how much of it is true, but it made me turn her right back around to face me, haha, so now she faces me.. Although we do have a stroller that we use sometimes and that faces outwards and Rylie is happy enough facing either way :O)|`|aJLx0nhNaa	I flip it if he's awake and we're somewhere interesting.  I do tend to keep it facing me more.  We bought a second smaller stroller (we don't have a car) for short trips, an umbrella stroller type and it is a bit weird not to be able to see him.  I find myself stopping sometimes and just giving a quick look.|`|DDFSITiYaa	Well at 7 months, the sights/sounds of the world are good for him for visual stimunlation.  I'd always try to have my kids face outward for this reason - to meet the world head on!|`|6lyvhRLsaa	I got one of those just this week, so far he loves it. I got it mainly for me to be able to see him, and for him to know his Mummy is still there.|`|LvbizUcwaa	He's prob not bored with you he just wants to look and see whats going on. Its ok that u have him look a different direction!
RqEwgDRdaa	This is a question for you and your husband to discuss and decide upon.<br>  <br>  But you aren't pregnant yet, so go ahead and finish your degree first.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	I am finishing my Master's and I wound up not taking any classes this year, which is frustrating because I'm so damn close.  Though part of the reason was money.<br>  <br>  I think it is possible, and I'm going back in the summer.  My son will be nearly a year old then.  I have learned to do a lot of things with a baby on my lap, I think I can learn to write papers.<br>  <br>  It will probably take you longer to finish your degree than if you didn't have a child, but I think it will be worth it.|`|uCnmYEPBaa	When my youngest was 2 1/2 I left my husband and went back to school and was working. I lived on campus and attended school full-time, worked 30 hours a week and still took care of my 2 children.<br>  It is do-able but you have to be ready to make sacrifices.<br>  I was only able to do my studying starting at 10 at night after the kids were in bed and asleep. Otherwise I couldn't get anything done.<br>  With your hubby there to help it may be easier for you if he understands that you need a certain amount of study time every night and he is willing to entertain the kids while you are doing that.<br>  Good luck!<br>  I am in my last semester of school and my new hubby is very supportive and I am 9 weeks away from having baby #3. He is due finals week so I'm trying to get ahead on my school work in case he decides to come early|`|IlyS8KGzaa	I was working and going to night school while I was pregnant, but now that Tresa is here, I just work.  I have been thinking a lot about school again, but I don't know if I can do it just yet.  My baby gets to come to work with me, where as she wouldn't be able to come to school with me.  I just don't think I am ready for that yet.  <br>  <br>  Can it be done?  Sure.  Were women.  We Rock!!!  lol|`|abT0o6hHaa	This is absolutely possible. I have had both my babies in college and haven't missed a beat. I stay home with them during the day and take classes a few nights a week so my hubby can be home with them. When I had only my first child, i went to school 2 nights a week and worked on weekends. Online classes are a big help too. having a baby doesn't turn your whole life upside down. You may just have to move some things around a bit|`|8RfmosODaa	Good question, I often thought of going back to school but didnt know of i could do it. My son is 3 and will be starting pre-k soon, so that could be easer for me. I say you should go for it, if you have a supportive bf or husband to help u with baby duties!|`|33h5R8nTaa	I am in the same boat. i went back to school when my daughter was born at the begining of fall semester because i took on-line classes except math and i did that at night. I am going back to work thursday and she is coming with me cause i work in a day care.|`|UYU1kapPaa	I went back when my baby was 6 months old.  I'm not going to tell you it was easy.  I had a lot of late nights and a lot of times I wanted to quit.  I had one semester that I actually with drew from my classes because I was so stressed out.  The bottom line is if you are dedicated and really want the degree you can juggle both.  I did it and I'm really proud of myself.  It is definitely worth it.  Good Luck!  Oh, I wouldn't wait till the kid is in kindergarten because then you start having school functions on top of everything else.  Best of Luck!!|`|DsB0WLbsaa	Very possible.  I am working full time (40 hours/week) and taking three college classes per quarter. <br>  I went back to both work and school when my son was 6 weeks old. <br>  Its hard, but you can do it!|`|oA8Rtyxuaa	Its definitely possible. A lot of schools also have free on campus day care so that might help you out too! They use the daycare for the child study students sometimes.|`|ad9efc98eb0fbeeae6b6c4abfd63046caa	it is possible with some campuses having creches and day care for kids so go for it
60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	My youngest (12 months)- NEVER.  There is no way I can sleep with him.  I tried recently at a hotel room and no one slept.  <br>  <br>  My 4 year old sleeps with us on Saturday nights and often wanders into our bed in the middle of the night on other nights.  It has been happening more and more frequently.  I'm working on making his room more comfortable for him; apparently there is a monster on the loose.<br>  <br>  When we can't be intimate in our bed, there's always the shower, sofa, and washing machine, lol.  ; )|`|cAtWxJG1aa	our 3-year-old will often wander in and climb into our bed about an hour before we wake up (he decides it's time to get up and play but can be persuaded to sleep another hour with us).  when we had just one child, she would sleep in our bed all night from time to time.  we had three more kids after her, so obviously it's not that hard to find another place to go....|`|EtCRnDJMaa	my girls have aways slept with me.  My older 2 sleep int heir own room now, but my 4 yr old sleeps with me.  My husband is in Afghanistan now so that answers the sex question!<br>  <br>  <br>  my daughter sleeps with me because she has from day 1 and has never moved out into her own bed.  No reason to!|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	Yes, sometimes they do.<br>  <br>  No, how would we do that?  Our second child was born of immaculate conception.  <br>  <br>  Why?

I feel it's very important for him to be in his own bed.|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	oh please|`|45nSn7Rcaa	No, our children never slept in our room.  We have sex enough.<br>  Children should never sleep in parents room unless they are sick or scared or its a special occasion, like one parent out of town so they get to room with the one who's there and have special bonding time.|`|T52u1DVXaa	My son will on occasion get in the bed with us.  When he falls asleep we usually put him back in his bed.  <br>  <br>  There are plenty of other places in the house to have sex.  You're not limited to just your bed, though some people seem to think that.|`|zlGb9NkZaa	my one year old sleeps in my bed if she wakes up at night or in the wee hours of the morning, because i want more sleep. i'm seperated from my husband, so the rest of the questions aren't applicable.|`|sVdQSMvJaa	no she does not sleep with us but she sleeps in her crib in our room...we do not engage in any sexual activity while she is in the same room as us.

IlyS8KGzaa	google the Magic Kingdom Castle.  More than likely it will lead you in the direction you are looking for.
IRFbj0G9aa	I don't think I have ever heard of a fever after first tooth loss.  Perhaps it is simply a coincidence that he spiked a fever from an infection  at the same time as his first tooth coming out.  Does the area around his lost tooth look extremely red? Is it unusually swollen, out of the ordinary painful?..... cause if it had something to do with the tooth.....  It would show, and the fever would not be a good sign.  So I really don't think you need to worry, I would just wait out the fever and if it persists more than 3 days or notice a turn for the worse, then I would call the doctor.  It also doesn't sound like you are having trouble controlling the fever right?  My general course of action is:  If they acting normal (not lethargic, generally active) or acting normal but just happen to have the fever I simply observe closely for any changes, I am very consistent about administering the medicine for the fever, don't stop the medicine just cause you see the temp.  hasn't gone back up after his last dose has worn off.  You are supposed to continue I think for the rest of the 24 hour period.  Congrats for the first tooth, and I wouldn't worry.  But remember you know your child best!  So no matter what the rest of us say, if your gut tells you things are off and not so simple, a phone-call to your pediatrician never hurts.|`|3e6a0352692daa69f91ba7801ba43609aa	The dry heaving is most likely the result of the blood from the lost tooth.  The fever indicates his body is fighting some kind of infection.  If the fever is high over 101, take him to the doctor.  If it's just a low grade fever, I might wait a day to see whether the body can fight the infection by itself.<br>  <br>  Basically the answer is yes to both.  It is fairly normal and you should keep an eye on him.  The dry heaving and fever might be related, but then again, they may not.  There's a lot of flu going around, as it is the season.  <br>  <br>  But if you are worried, do take him to the doctor.  The pediatrician should know whether a dentist is necessary.  It isn't usually.|`|RJLSN6BXaa	fevers are usually indicators of infection...if the fever persists he should probably take him to the doctor<br>  <br>  the dry heaving could just be a result of tasting blood if the tooth bled a lot..the taste of blood can make some people sick to their stomachs|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	no he is probably sick

I personally wouldn't use it for either gender, I immediately think of the word crime or grim when I see this name. Scarlett or Sienna would be a much better option in my opinion.|`|claUGpVRaa	Crimson is a colour, not a name for either boy or girl in  my opinion!<br>  Sorry|`|eg9VRVQaaa	I personally wouldn't use it for a name, but it sounds more girly to me.|`|0be940862a3c253f0432eb848850e14aaa	It is neither; it is a color.|`|XzV4bUeFaa	Never heard of it before so I have no idea.  I wouldn't use it for either.|`|kPl8TTzNaa	It is a color, not a name. And if anything, it sounds masculine and therefore is a male's name. It has the masculine -SON ending. I fail to see how that could be "girly" or "unisex".
stRWElvPaa	When was your last period? If it has been more than 28-35 days and you have a regular period then you can test now. Basically 2 weeks after you ovulate. good luck!
Jo2DfRzaaa	there is a difference between complete 8 hours of rest and interrupted 8 hours of sleep.  yes you got 8 hours but when its 2 hours here 3 hours there and another 2 hours here, its not the same for your body. <br>  i was having the same conversation w/my husband today about our 3 yr old who is waking up at night time.<br>  <br>  its normal and it will pass.|`|bMvAmMTaaa	either you are not getting a good quality of sleep or it is because you are having broken up sleep, it will probably get better as she gets older meaning she will sleep longer and you will get a good amount of hours sleep in one go. my daughter sleeps 9 hours every night, but if i sleep late (e.g. 2am) i feel so shattered in the morning.|`|zlGb9NkZaa	are you still taking your prenatals or some kind of vitamin?<br>  it's possible you may have a vitamin deficiency... i did. though i was still tired (though not so drained feeling!) after i got that cleared up! interrupted sleep isn't quite as good! but sounds like your LO will be sleeping 8 hours before long :)|`|DNygQdmVaa	I have3 kids ages 15 months, 5 years, and 4 years.<br>  And yes I always feel like I dont get enough sleep, sometimes ill get 9 hours and still feel so tired.<br>  I feel tired all throughout the day.|`|nfzQkvqraa	There could be several reasons.  You could be oversleeping, you could be anemic, you could be depressed.  (just to name a few)  There are many things that would make you feel overtired.  I think the few I named are probably the most common for new moms of babies.<br>  <br>  I feel the same way sometimes.  It's a vicious cycle.  You feel tired so you sleep, you sleep and you feel like you wasted what could have been a productive day.|`|AA10236694	i honestly think its from being bored well in my case it is. its like how much can one person cook and clean Lol|`|Mapm6AI8aa	u will get used to it and no one is a baby 4eva. cherish it, hun.|`|hKJIDdVqaa	you need at least 6 hours of uninterrupted sleep a night. As a new mother that will not happen for a while.  That is why you are tired.  You are NOT lazy, Pregnancy and child birth are hard work. Rest up, you will need it.|`|SnQvsOPwaa	Lack of stimulus will suck the life out of you. It's one of the biggest challenges to being a stay at home parent. Join some kind of group. When you daughters sleeping do some kind of exercises. Make a list of chores and when you find yourself with nothing else to do just blindly follow the list. The key is to keep moving not on the computer or at the TV. Most towns and hospitals have newborn or parenting groups. Join one or two.
juEMQEtDaa	You are too young to have a baby but its your decision.<br>  I think you should tell your mum about how you feel about having a baby and just tell her in your own words that you "are" ready to have a baby.<br>  <br>  But tbh i really do think you should wait because you got your whole life ahead of you and its not like you need to have a baby yet anyway.|`|1SpbRdPEaa	well i think that you should wait until your a little older because right now<br>  your a little too young to have a baby but i know what u mean i myself wanted to have a baby with my bff. but when the right time comes then yes. but as for u girl u should take your time you and your boyfriend have all the time in world to have a baby. but for my advice i think you should wait until your ready okay? im only telling you this because i care and i think your ready to have a baby.|`|6PwhYOhIaa	Are you, for lack of better word, stupid? This is a sure-fire way to f*ck up your life. I'm 16 and I've seen it happen before when someone is not smart enough to at least stop by a CVS before hand. Sure, there is nothing wrong with wanting kids but you're too d*mn young to be having them. So take this in. If you're dumb enough to go ahead and do it, fine, I won't try to stop you. The only one who will end up hurting is you.|`|LhV8D2Xeaa	I dont know how mature you are but there is plenty of time to have a baby.  i would want to be married and living on my own first. try and make a plan first not baby first. i think your mom will understand i got pregnant at 18 it was real hard and of corse the dad left me but my mom didt freak out to bad. if she does your her daughter she will love you no matter what.|`|8NihgPsMaa	i was a bit older that u wen i fell preganant (by accident). i kinda understand what ur thinking like, but if u go ahead you will relise what ur missing out on i know i do sumtimes. i rent my own house have college qualification and a job. im not claiming benifits just child benifit which every1 is entitled to. wait a few more years go to college get a qualification so when your child is old enough you can work. i work in a nursery as a nursery nurse so take my son with me (10months old) (i have to pay but get discount). then if u tell ur mum ur pregg u can tell her that u have a plan coz u have qualification to get a job. gcse'/s get u nower! she will think ur more grown up then. i advise u to wait. xx|`|PjxamRdVaa	YOU ARE STUPID! I am 16 & just had my baby when I was 15. I hate teens like you. You don't know what you are getting yourself into. Wait until you are older if you are smart. And if not, don't say I didn't warn you. I love my son to death but it made my life so much harder and everyone judges me.|`|QAewZewYaa	Why would you want a baby at 15??? I understand ACCIDENTS happen, but actually trying for a baby?!<br>  If you're serious about this, why even do your exams?? You'll be wasting your time...bye bye life.|`|xF7XLRQzaa	Absolutely disgusting...<br>  Any hope for a future is out the window.  What's your moms number? I think someone needs to go to therapy..|`|xp0v840saa	You're a slag.|`|CjySz62Haa	enjoy your life, do not give it up for kids that early.you are kids, guys|`|U5iot8qfaa	trust me, wait until your older, you are way too young.|`|vIyGYz2paa	whoa..your 15 and want a baby?!?<br>  are you trying to be like amy from the secret life of the american teenager?!?!!?|`|bf6fb0f4caadf24cfa826edc2cc32d3baa	W~A~I~T~!~!~!~!<br>  <br>  <br>  You have plenty of time to become a mommy. Once you are a mommy, you are always a mommy. You need to enjoy being 15 instead of trying to grow up so fast. If you get pregnant at your age, you will regret it someday. You will love the baby, but you will regret losing your teenage years. You have a lot to think about. Who is gonna take care of him all day every day? How are you going to afford to buy the little tyke everything in the world that he needs? Oh, you are getting a job? So, who is gonna watch the baby while you are at work? If you want a baby, you need to be in a stable postion where you can take care of him. You have school. You may want to go to college when you graduate. What's that??? You don't want to go to college? How do you know? You still have at least 3 years of school left. You have no idea what you will want 3 years from now. <br>  <br>  Think about it... 2 years ago you didn't know that you wanted to have a baby with your boyfriend did you? You may have not even known that this would be your boyfriend. What if he decides that he wants to go to college, or get a different girlfriend? What are you gonna do then. If he is shacked up with someone else, do you think he is gonna care about you? Nope. Oh, I see... You two are in "love". Yep, heard that one before. Over and over again. <br>  <br>  Listen, I don't want you to get upset, but you need to listen to some good advice...<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Learn from other people's mistakes. It is smarter. You will learn the same lessons that other people will learn by doing it your own way and being bull-headed because you "know what you want," but it will be a lot more painful. Wisen up girl!!! Look around, and you will see that what you are proposing to do is silly. Don't get pregnant just because you can. Be responsible. <br>  <br>  Also, think about the baby. Not just yourself and just what you want. Think about how much better of a home you could provide for the baby if you were out of school, had a husband, a home, a stable job (with insurance). You have the choice. Make the right one.|`|7rCeCVl2aa	If you are afraid to tell your mommy... don't you think you should be reconsidering this? I mean hell if you are afraid to tell your mom something are you *really* an adult capable of adult decisions?|`|IlyS8KGzaa	Sweetheart, please rethink your decision to do this.  Being a mom is very hard work.  Sometimes teens think they are missing something in their lives, such as love, or wanting to be treated like an adult, and they think that having a baby will fill that void, but I assure you it will only make your life harder.  Don't get me wrong, being a mother is very fulfilling, but you have so much time ahead of you do accomplish so many things.  Why do you want to rush your life so much??  Take your time and enjoy your teen years.|`|CVdcrY3kaa	Best advice I can give you, wait! A few questions...<br>  <br>  1. How are you and your boyfriend going to pay for everything?<br>  <br>  2. Do you know how much it cost to raise a child?<br>  <br>  3. Where will you live?<br>  <br>  4. Are you going to be truly committed to each other for a lifetime?<br>  <br>  5. Are you going to continue school?<br>  <br>  6. Who will babysit? How much will they charge?|`|MPba9IUBaa	what the **** is wrong with you?<br>  do you know how hard it is to be a teen mother? have you any idea what your really wanting to do? its not all fun. the staying up all night, the crying, the diapers. the money??????<br>  have you actually thought this through? your very stupid if your gonna go through with that.|`|vKEYa8aeaa	you are an idiot. <br>  <br>  <br>  you need to grow up, and having a baby ISNT the way to do it.|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	you should really wait. NO teen at your age is ready for a baby. your mom will be furious and embarrassed.|`|7d84621e89c49bcba037226d3361c90baa	Don't come on here and ask us for advice about this when you are 15.  We're not going to help you.  You're too young to have a baby, and it really ticks us off that our tax dollars are going to be going to take care of selfish, irresponsible children who think that having babies is something you do just because you "want" to.  It's not like buying an ipod.  This is another human life you're going to be responsible for.  I "wanted" to have a baby all my teenage years, too, but I was mature and responsible enough to put the needs and interests of my future children ahead of my own desires.  You need to straighten up and do the same.  If you're not willing to do that, then you're already a bad mother, and you're not even pregnant yet.<br>  <br>  Finish school, and get a job and support yourself.  Then think about having a baby.|`|J2glFOkhaa	It's my boyfriend and I, I hope you're taking a grammar exam<br>  <br>  At 15, I bet you're not eve old enough to work, and if you are it isn't at a job that can provide for a baby. Do you know how much you spend on a baby weekly? Or even monthly? It is more expensive than you ever imagine.<br>  <br>  I look forward to supporting your child if you do have one. Considering you'll be on welfare, and my tax dollars will pay for everything your child needs. <br>  <br>  Grow up|`|930a625eb301aae633a9b9d8e18e0752aa	If you are scared that mom is going to ground you for anything, you shouldn't be doing it. <br>  <br>  Tell your mom before you are actually pregnant that your trying so she can set you straight.|`|I3CNklLKaa	And who exactly is going to pay for the upkeep of your illegitimate child. The British taxpayer?<br>  <br>  Grow up - get a job - get married, get a house THEN have babies when you can afford them.|`|AA12251362	Your mom will probably kick you out, and hopefully she does, just think of the future that you CANT provide at your age?|`|SlBsJ3NRaa	You're not old enough to try for a baby until you don't need permission.|`|nmu6coapaa	Oh for God sake you're only a baby yourself? Do you even realise how much work a baby is and how much money you will need?|`|08GDBedGaa	live your life, before you create another!!|`|GgVufxlHaa	Seriously hun, you're not ready to have a baby at all. How will you know when you're ready? You won't have to come to Yahoo Answers asking people how to tell your mother that you're 15 and want to get pregnant. There is no legitimate argument you can make for wanting to plan for a baby at this age. Until you can support yourself and your child, you are not ready.<br>  I'm pregnant with my first baby at 24, and my husband and I are still experiencing some financial issues. I can only imagine what it would be like for an unemployed 15 year old and her boyfriend. <br>  Ask yourself why you want this. A baby is not some magical little creature that will take care of itself and just sit there and look cute when you want it to. A baby is a little human being, one that takes time, effort, care, money, responsibilty, love, stability, and support. I doubt you and your boyfriend could provide the majority of those. I can see why you would be hesitant to tell your mother- what mother want to hear that her 15 year old child wants a baby? Especially when she'll probably end up taking care of it? <br>  You need to sit down with her and explain what you want so she can make sure it doesn't happen.|`|7i6qj4OXaa	If you are seriously considering this, then I trust you have your own home and a good income between the two of you.  Of course, you will be unable to work at first and then it will cost you to put your child into a nursery.  Think about what babies need not what you need.  You know you shouldn't be sexually active, as it is against the law and your boyfriend could get into trouble.  I am sure your mum will be far less shocked about the fact that you are sexually active, than the fact that you are going to be stupid enough to give birth at so young an age.|`|SLph9RX6aa	you NEED to tell your mother your plans, she can talk to you about it and help you decide if this is a good decision, from my experience as a teen, its not a good idea but thats MY opinion, how long have you been with him, and do really you know the enormous amount of pressure a baby brings, you have a whole life ahead of you, once you have a baby, your life revolves around theres, you really need to speak to your mum.<br>  how ,long have you been with your boyfriend, at your age you probably wont be with him in a month or two, then YOUR going to be lumbered with the baby, trust me all the men say they will be great with a baby, you may even think that he will, but when the times comes, thats when you will notice your boyfriend is BOY and not a man.|`|VCCKfT3taa	When I was a kid I was obsessed with what was "right" and "wrong", and kept asking my mom if this or that was okay to do. Finally she told me,<br>  "Missy, I'll tell you what. If you want to do something, and it doesn't sound like it's something you could tell me about, or it's something I would be mad at you about, then don't do it."<br>  <br>  I think that's a good philosophy for you to take on, since you're still a child. If it doesn't seem like something you could tell your mother, maybe you shouldn't do it in the first place.|`|BT4wna2Vaa	Seriously?<br>  I'm 16 with a 9 month old daughter, why the world would you ever plan something like that?<br>  Don't get me wrong, I love my daughter, but it wasn't planned, and I would never intentionally do something like that.<br>  You are too young to even think about something like that.<br>  Honestly, I wish I wouldn't have been sexually active to begin with.<br>  <br>  You definitely need a hobby.|`|8026ec062aaa229b35c5aceb76a16035aa	Let me just list the reasons you are too young for a baby:<br>  <br>  1. You need help asking your Mom for permission.<br>  2. You are not a high school graduate. <br>  3. You do not live on your own.<br>  4. You are still a child yourself.<br>  5. You aren't old enough to vote.<br>  6. You aren't old enough to drive. <br>  7. You probably still have a curfew. <br>  8. You do not have a job to support your child.<br>  <br>  etc.,etc.,etc.<br>  <br>  Your curfew is only going to get moved to an earlier time because you ae going to have a baby to take care of. Your baby daddy is probably not going to be around as long as you'd like to think. You will become a high school dropout and be an unproductive member of society. <br>  <br>  Oh, how proud  Mum will be that her 15 yr old is standing in the welfare and food stamp line at the local DSS to pay for her illegitimate child because she couldn't wait to play house until she was a little older and more intelligent.|`|R1Fc344laa	DUDE, DO YOU KNOW THAT YOU WILL HAVE TO CONSSTANTLY TAKE YOUR BABY TO DOCTOR BECAUSE BABIES ALWAYS GET SICK?

NPmRmnG6aa	At my classes we used the pillow and blanket for breathing exercises, and they showed us techniques to ease back labor. We never had to bring a doll. We watched a birth (movie) at every class except the last one and that one we learned about what to do after giving birth.|`|oA8Rtyxuaa	in the class i took, the pillow was used to show you different ways to lay and prop yourself to be more comfortable. The baby might be to show you some different holds for breastfeeding or just in general. My doctor called it an "epidural class" lol|`|VEi3R0craa	well I delivered my last two kids in Pennsylvania hospital in Philly and they had several classes to choose from first was Lamaze which showed women how to cope with labor and go drug free.  Then Birthing classes were the classes that showed you how to deal with labor and also inform you of all your options drug wise.  Then they had parenting classes which incorporated all above and also showed how to care for the child after wards and how both parents will need to adjust that it is something that effects the whole family not just the women.  So to answer you question finally LOL all depends what the meaning of you class really is.  most likely it is to learn different positions and relaxation techniques.
vue9NOhYaa	The doctor cannot 'decide to induce you.' It's your body, and your decision.<br>  <br>  He may well bring up the subject and OFFER to induce you, but if all is well, there is no reason to rush into anything.|`|Bw1h5xAcaa	They will likely begin talking to you about it. Many doctors still won't induce until you are well past 41 weeks and nearning 42 weeks, that is, as long as baby is still thriving and your blood pressures remain stable.<br>  <br>  There's no predicting. Some doctors will induce at a lower threshhold than others will.|`|aWkp6AJOaa	my dr likes to induce up to 12days before dd.  i have been very fortunate that i didn't have to go all the way to 40 wks.  the last baby i was induced at 12days early & she was 9lbs 5oz!!!  it really just depends on that dr.  i know alot will let you wait up to 42 wks.  i am sorry you are having to wait so long.  i will cross my fingers for you so he will tell you on Friday he will induce you!!<br>  good luck, your baby will be here sooner than you know it.  :)|`|zSABr7praa	My doctor always says he prefers a week early as oppose to a week late.  I hope your doctor will induce you, but I can't really tell you wether he will or he won't!  Do lots of walking and spend some "special" time with your husband to speed things a long!!
1thzSbS8aa	Your friend is either spinning some wild tales, or she's been pregnant this entire time without realizing it.  The answerers above who said she couldn't get pregnant 3 times in 3 months are correct. It is a statistical impossiblity. <br>  <br>  Furthermore, it's not possible to end a pregnancy at only a couple weeks along by punching one's self in the stomach, falling onto the ground, down the stairs, etc. The embryo at that stage is TINY and it's deep inside another organ. She might as well believe she can smash a sesame seed inside of a basketball by hitting the basketball over and over. <br>  <br>  Whatever "medicine from her country" she's taking is probably laxatives or some quack concoction that makes her bleed. That doesn't mean she's terminated her pregnancy. If she was ever pregnant at all, that is.<br>  <br>  I have the feeling that you and your friends only have this girl's word that she took a pregnancy test, that she took it correctly, that it was positive, and that she managed to miscarry between Saturday and today without having to go to the hospital. Did you actually hear from her parents' own lips that they know their daughter has been pregnant six times and they don't care that she's making herself miscarry at home? Or did you only hear that from the daughter?<br>  <br>  You need to be aware that a lot of young girls lie about being pregnant. They lie about it all the time, over and over. Every act of sex results in pregnancy, according to them, and every time they get their period, they announce they've miscarried. They lie because they have a pathological need for attention and drama. Sometimes they even convince themselves with their own lies.<br>  <br>  Well, it's one or the other. She's either several months pregnant, or she was lying all along. Either way, you are wasting your breath trying to tell her what to do. Your friend and Reality don't seem to be well-acquainted.|`|sMuMfuAgaa	Maybe let her know that doing this to herself constantly is showing that she has a lack of respect for herself and is really unhealthy especially at the age of 16. Medicines that make you have miscariges can be dangerous if used to much and so can punching herself in the stomach when she's pregnant.  A 16 year old does not need to be out in the world constantly having sex, especially if she's been pregnant that many times.|`|KOwzDLPdaa	Medication, punching yourself in the stomach and other such crap is just that, a load of crap. She is likely lying about being pregnant, you can't be pregnant three times in three months!<br>  <br>  I repelled out of a damned helicopter when I was 6 weeks pregnant with my second because I didn't know I was pregnant and he was just fine.<br>  <br>  She is lying for the attention and you are her enabler. Cut her off, don't listen to her drama and she will take a hint.<br>  <br>  Whats wrong with kids these days?|`|2JKt3Nkqaa	:O I would stand by her!!!!!!!!!!! A friend is a friend maybe for life.True friends are hard to find. She has had miscarriage's so she needs a good friend more than ever! either that or she just a f*****g liar that needs to be hit hard. knock the sence back into that girl stupid b**ch|`|lTsPX04jaa	its going to suck for her when she wants to have a baby and her body wont let her. tell her to stop being a slut|`|GBy0W2YEaa	she lying she carnnt b preg 3 time in 3mouth if she was preg for 6week|`|zjPhjKY7aa	why the hell is this girl not on the pill?|`|ivjHOJ8daa	Oh dear.. this girl sounds troubled.<br>  I'd have a strong sit-down talk with her about contraception...<br>  If she doesn't want these children she's lost, she should be preventing future pregnancies until she is mature and ready.<br>  <br>  I'd strongly remind her the fact that there are women in the world, that cannot have children, and she is just time and time again, throwing babies away. <br>  <br>  If she doesn't listen.. maybe there is an adult you can speak to, whether it be your parents, her parents, guidance staff at the school or college you may attend?<br>  <br>  Just somebody that can speak to the girl.|`|aF5BHOPkaa	Wow it sounds like she has some major mental issues going on.  And her parents are even worse for allowing this type of behavior!! Maybe she doesn't realize that a baby can actually feel pain at only 20 weeks!!!

Sounds more to me that she allows sex to keep the guy. So typical of a girl with no self esteem.  What can you do? Nothing, she knows how a person gets pregnant, heck even my 7 year old knows that.  Pretty soon it will be no concern, as her body will be so tore up from multiple pregnancy loses she will probably end up infertile.|`|N24wkFROaa	She's a liar then, get better friends.|`|QGP930C6aa	thts sick --- sorry no offence---- you need to really speak to her no matter how harsh its for her own good. just tell her that if she keeps doin what shes doin then she may never be able to have kids. seriously she needs to talk to a proffessional and get help this is not good for her. and the fact that her parents dont care is disgusting. just try and tell her the truth about how worried you are about what shes doin and that she could do herself some serious damage|`|dDGKUTT1aa	take the pill ,use condoms,why would you put yourself through that,tell her to go to the doctors for contraception|`|olMVfnljaa	She sounds like a creep.|`|claUGpVRaa	Why does she not just use contraception  and then she wouldn't have to force herself to miscarry when she gets pregnant. There are a lot of women out there who are desperate to fall pregnant and can't and all she is doing is being extremely lazy and selfish (although you sound like you know this already)<br>  What about all the STD's she may pick up by sleeping with all these men? That is just as serious as her continually getting herself pregnant. She sounds immature and needs help desperately. Can you speak to her parents or are they aware what she is doing? If they don't know, tell them even if it gets her into trouble as it is definitely for her own good in this case. Are you at school still? If so, anonymously tell a teacher what she s doing and the teacher can approach her parents. Something has to be done about such a stupid, immature and ignorant girl!

uFrqC4Y2aa	If you get them every time 2 weeks before your period sounds more like ovulation cramps. Also, maybe, PMDD (it's just more severe PMS like pains- no big deal). Ask your doctor.|`|BO28Mn8haa	umm, take a test if you don't get your period. simple|`|PjxamRdVaa	Yeah, hun. Called PMS/PMDD. Check it out-<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.womentowomen.com/menstruation/pmssymptoms.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.womentowomen.com/menstruation...</a><br>  <br>  Hope I helped!|`|5RvTXdmUaa	What's the question? You asked if these are period signs and then listed your period signs. Yes those are period signs, everyone has different pms.|`|xfxlpT2Waa	you might be pregnant or yes u could be getting ur period!|`|a1uoxczTaa	u just want to hear that u mite be pregnant! silly goose...|`|LvbizUcwaa	Shes getting her period it sounds like. It could be just pms! If this happens every time u get ur period then u could consider it "normal".
oA8Rtyxuaa	It sure is! Is he getting around in another way? like army crawl or scooting or rolling? Some kids skip the traditional crawling all together!|`|5edd13b91e6ca6a91c699a9220d74413aa	Yes, some kids skip the crawling stage.  It's usually around 8 months.  but if he's pulling up already i wouldn't worry.|`|x17ldUfCaa	My son did the same thing..He just turned 1 in Jan. he didn't get it til about 9 months then walked 2 wks b4 his bday. Don't worry about it..Every baby is different. My daughter crawled early but they say it takes boys longer so he'll get it soon..
ZNhP3mpUaa	Yes that is correct. Most* women don't start ovulating until 7-10 days past the end of their period... so while ON your period and the day or 2 after, you're chances of concieving are significantly lower.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Actually right when your period ends is prime time to get pregnant. Also some women ovulate during their period. There is really no such thing as a "safe time" to have unprotected sex. Not even considering pregnancy there is such a thing as STD's.|`|7d84621e89c49bcba037226d3361c90baa	Less chances, yes.  Is it possible, though?  Yes.  It has happened.  I have a friend who got pregnant in college who only skipped protection once, and that was when she and her boyfriend had sex on the last day of her period.  She thought that the chances were so small that it was worth the risk.<br>  <br>  Don't be lax on using protection just because there's "less chance" of getting pregnant.  There are plenty of women out there who can tell you from experience that it's not worth the risk.
GWveqx61aa	your cycle was 34 days, this month you are on cd15, which you should be or have ovulated already.knowing only one cycle its hard to say if you are regular.but you should ovulate about 14 days b4 your period is due. but id cound 12 days after 1st day of period and have sex every 24 hours until 6 days later, than wait about 10 days and take a preg test, if neg, than test in 3 more days, you may not become pregnant right away because the effects of the birth control?~☆good luck☆~?
X8fwBpsyaa	Don't worry this is perfectly normal. Some people barely bleed while on the pill, and taking one half an hour late is unlikely to make it less effective (though it depends on which pill she's taking). If she's in the UK her GP MUST keep what she tells him confidential. So she should just make an appointment and ask any questions she needs to. If she doesn't want to she can take an ordinary pregnancy test, you can get them from most chemists (Boots stocks them), and many supermarkets.  Bare in mind she needs to wait a minimum of two weeks after the sex to take a pregnancy test.<br>  <br>  If you guys are extra paranoid use condoms as well as the pill.|`|claUGpVRaa	If she took the pill only half hour late then you should be okay.<br>  The pill lightens periods anyway, so it may just be that she had a period that lasted only a day or so - that's quite possible even if it is unusual! <br>  Tell her to go to the doctor, the doctor is bound by confidentiality rules and as she is 17 and over the age for consent her parents would not be informed anyway.  She could also do a home test away from her parents.<br>  <br>  Has she been on antibiotics or been sick or anything? Please be aware the pill might not work if she has to take any other drugs or if she is sick so always use another form of contraception too if either of those things occur.<br>  Good luck|`|bPx4Fax5aa	Hi<br>  <br>  You need to search for family planning centers near your home on the net. If you live in the UK there are specific centeres called the Brook for young people. <br>  <br>  No clinics, doctors or family planning will ever contact your parents without your permission.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|AA11549970	Hiya,<br>  Don't panic - if your g/f visits her GP its confidential - the Doctor cannot discuss any issues with her mum without her conset - so I would recommend that in the first instance your g/f sees her GP. It may be that the anxiety she has been feeling has caused her normal monthly cycle to be disrupted. Good luck.|`|IPoaeWXPaa	Its illegal for ur doctor to talk to ANYONE else about ur medical history...that includes ur parents!
hKJIDdVqaa	hmm, what is wrong with you kids now a  days?  Tell her to quit having sex. Geez, you guys can have sex all day long when you get older, why do you need to do it now.  The pill is not fool proof, I had my second son while on the pill and I had my period for 3 months while I was pregnant with him.  Young girls often have irregular periods too, that cannot be counted on. Tell her to go to a DR.|`|pJieNfzOaa	The pregnancy test is pretty accurate and the morning after pill nearly always works i wouldn't worry too much there's a high chance she wont be pregnant .

FTwYckN2aa	I'm almost positive you have to wait. I'm sorry for your situation... don't let everyone's negative comments get you down. Obviously you can't change what has been done. Instead focus on you're LO and taking care of him/her. Best of luck I hope it all turns out the way you want.|`|AA10226047	Yes but it could cause you to miscarry and the doctor will tell you that.  You can ask for one once the baby is born and as long as you, the baby and the baby's father are there they will do it.  It will take a little while to get the results back but it is better than the other way.  Or you can go to court and they will order a DNA test to be done after the baby is born.|`|BcdbR6iSaa	You can, it's expensive and invasive. It can put the baby at risk. I researched this for one of my guy friends, he's going to wait till the child is born. It cost about $1000 to have it done it utero. <br>  <br>  Good Luck!!|`|o4NarYVoaa	yeah but it is very dangerous for the baby, you'll have to wait. its your fault you have been having sex with numerous guys, dont risk your babies life for your stupidity!|`|u1DDrXO2aa	Im not trying to be mean but you should know who the father of your child is!!! you could have a amniocenteses but i do not recommend it not very safe at all!!! Good luck finding out though!|`|t9S0dqfLaa	Sleep with only one man at a time, I refuse to believe that people don't know who their baby daddy is.  They know who it is they just wish it wasn't|`|lYZ71zYAaa	YOU"LL HAVE TO WAIT!|`|aJLx0nhNaa	Well, I knew who the baby's father was while the baby was still in me.|`|7rCeCVl2aa	Yes you can do a DNA test with the amniotic fluid. It's very invasive.<br>  <br>  You are probably better off waiting until the baby is born... you can call Maury. He'll do it for free.|`|oA8Rtyxuaa	I think you can get a DNA test, they stick a needle in your stomach and pull out amniotic fluid, its called Amniocentesis. Im not sure any doctor would do it solely for a paternity test though, they are generally used to test for chromosomal disorders of for women over 35.|`|0WASp0bHaa	A doctor is not going to perform an amniocenteses just to determine paternity. This procedure is a risk to the baby. It is used to check for genetic problems if the baby is at risk for any.|`|IFDfpbFJaa	You can ask your doctor about doing the amniocenteses but I would just wait. I don't know for sure if they can do a paternity test from that or not.|`|DNygQdmVaa	you have to wait.
KY6tgDa4aa	Sometimes the best way to tell someone something that they may not be too happy to hear, is to write it out in a letter. Tell her everything you want, your hopes for yourself, as well as your child (if you are keeping it), tell her that you are ready to take this challenge on head first, and that you realize that life is not only about you anymore. If you plan on adopting, tell her that. Let her know that you have thought about this for however long you are, and that you have made up your mind. Let her know your decision, and let her know that you know and understand how this is going to change your life. One of the first thoughts your mom may have is thinking that SHE will have to raise your child. Tell her that you intend on taking on that responsibility. While you are pregnant, talk to your school, and see about early graduation. See if you can double up on classes before you have the baby. Take time off of college if you have to. Get a job. Even if it is just a part time minimum wage job. If your mom can see what you are trying to do, she will be more apt to willingly help out. Let her know that this is indeed a blessing, not a burden. The biggest reason I say to write this letter is because you can get out ALL of your thoughts and ideas without worrying about interruption. Sit her down, and let her read the letter. Dont talk to her until she has read EVERYTHING. THen have an adult conversation. I hope everything works out in the end!!!|`|9cpwsrJiaa	When my husband and I told our parents we bought a gift bag and put tissue paper in it and put my positive pregnancy tests in it. My mom wasn't thrilled (I'm her youngest and 20 years old) but it was definetly better to tell her. She got over the shock within about 3-4 weeks and now she's beside herself with excitement. She's decorated a room at her house for the baby and bought clothes and toys and the works.<br>  <br>  It will only get harder to tell her if you wait. She could be some much needed support for you as well and could go to OB appointments with you. Trust me, you don't want to go all by yourself. There is so much joy to share with someone at those visits when you see the little heartbeat... Just tell her. :-D|`|Vf4w8dNNaa	I know this sounds bad but i texted my mom. haha <br>  we were talking about this "secret" i needed to tell her but couldnt because of fear of her disapproval.  And she begged me until i let her know.  <br>  Honestly, i think it was for the better.  Some ppl will frown upon this but it gave her a chance to calm down and soak it all in before she had a chance to talk to me about it.<br>  We had a lovly lunch the next day.<br>  Im 19 and 3 months pregnant.  So i understand what your going through.  No matter what the reaction she come around in the end and be supportive.  Be strong!!|`|d3jtRA8caa	Sit her down, and tell her. It will be hard, it was for me. Tell her what your wishes are, do expect some shock. If she loves you she will support any decision you make about your baby.|`|78D0QzKFaa	Tell them now! They will be upset at first and maybe even mad, but that to shall pass.  To earn there respect you need to be up front and honest. This will show good character.|`|LVUcTnZmaa	just say "guess what mom i hopped a ride to sausage town, and got stuck with a little passenger on the way back"|`|ROJans2Taa	I was 16 when I got pregnant, I waited 2 weeks then decided that hiding it wasn't going to solve any problems, I needed to just come out with it, I said "mom, ive got some bad news, my period was late, I took a test, and im pregnant" she cried and then got herself together and supported me, she did give my boyfriend sh** though,lol. my advice , just get it over with so you can move forward, best luck|`|gaGQyJWLaa	just tell her...shes your mom she'll be mad at first but eventually she'll come along|`|KddwYRFRaa	Tell her straight up: "Mom, this is very difficult for me to tell you... I'm pregnant." Now I don't know your mom, and I don't know how she'll react to this information, but no matter her personality, the worst thing to do is not tell her. How would you feel if your future child didn't tell you she was pregnant until too late? Telling her early will not only gain you some lenience, it'll give you much-needed time to prepare for the new addition to the family (if you choose to have it.)|`|g9TxgMlwaa	Just go out and tell her straight up no matter how rough it may seem. She will probably more than likely be completely angry, upset, and disappointed but I promise she'll get over it once it sinks in. I'm not saying that life is going to be kittens and rainbows afterward but she'll be there for you. And I think the earlier the better so she can be there for you, for all the appointments and just for the times you need someone one if the father won't be present. Another thing if you were adult enough to make the decision to have sex then suck it up take a deep breath and approach your mother like an adult! Good Luck!|`|dRo89MsYaa	probably the best thing to do is just tell them. that's how i told my mom and dad. I asked them to hear me out first and then pass judgement later.|`|KNxs4PrZaa	mom im pregnant|`|JPa0GzDjaa	In my personal experience I wrote them a letter, (Which I wasn't planning on giving them for a few weeks) but they found it and read it and seemed to take it quite well considering.<br>  <br>  It depends on how supportive you think your parents will be to whether you tell them to their face or not.|`|h6vqu7mjaa	I don't understand what is going on with kids today. Its not cute to be having a baby when u are still so young . There are 15 girls prego in the high school in my town. You will realize the mistake later. However dear , you ought to just tell your mother . Tell her you need to talk to her and just let it out. If she reacts , let her. Leave it alone a while , hopefully she will realize that although you have made a mistake , you are her daughter and she loves you . Try to be relaxed as possible dear, letting yourself get too stressed out can affect the baby also. Just accept what comes your way and have some faith , that things happen as they are meant to, God willing, everything will be alright. Good luck .|`|MUVdG9n1aa	Just sit down with her somewhere there are no other distractions and out with it. It will help if you have thought through what you are planning on doing (keeping the baby, giving it up for adoption) where you will live, if you are going to finish school. This is never easy. I was 19 with my first son and it can be very hard. Just try and be as adult as you can... you are now going to have to be : Chin up|`|5yJdpf3caa	If you are keeping the baby,<br>  Sit her down and tell her what happened.. how you slipped... and that your sorry. but assure her you are going to grow up/mature and raise this baby in the best way possible.

Thats what i did...twice!!|`|4VDWKHX3aa	I'm 23. 4 months ago I was in the position you're currently in. I didn't know how to tell my parents. I am not married, however I've been with my boyfriend for 8 years. My situation is a bit different because I have a job, my house (b/f doesn't live with me), I pay my bills but I'm still a bit under mom and dad's supervision. I was scared to tell them. I'm the only girl (I have only a brother) and my parents are the ONLY ones who aren't grandparents. I sat with them both and told them I was about a month pregnant. My dad surprisingly was like, "For real? Is this a joke?" My mom was like, "Yey! Finally!!!". They both surprised me. I guess cause I'm older than you because they said it would be diffferent it I were younger than 18, living at home, no job and obviously not going to college. You just have to think about your future. Dont settle for food stamps cause that's stupid and poor. I hate when people have rims on their cars, Louis Vuitton fake bags (thinkin' they the sh**) but yet are at the counter paying with a Lonestar card. Ugh. How low! I'd understand if you REALLY need it cause you make less than $30k a year or something. Just make sure you work for your sake and your baby's AND DONT go and get an abortion just cause you're scared. People make mistakes but should always deal with their consequences. We are all adults in this world. Good luck.

zlGb9NkZaa	first, i'd start with getting her to go to sleep without nursing, and when that's mastered start weaning. (that's where i am now!)<br>  <br>  i got my 12 month old away from going to sleep nursing by removing her before she was totally asleep and then rocking her, then laying her in the crib & patting/rubbing her back, then just standing there for a bit, then leaving the room. i would do each step a little sooner each time (with her more awake). at first it took a while, and she'd be fine until i would leave the room then she'd yell for me. i'd let her yell for a minute & go lay her back down & pat her back, etc. repeat as necessary :)<br>  <br>  it usually only takes about 15 min to get her to take a nap now! and she rarely fusses about it. it did take 2 hours (and going in to lay her back down half a dozen times) one of the first times! but it's only been a few weeks since we started.|`|bMvAmMTaaa	i think you should just offer her food everytime she gets hungry and avoid giving in to the breastfeeding, eventually she will have no choice but to take what you offer. let her run around a lot and like you said she will not always be bothered about having the breast. when she has had this little run around, always only offer her food and pretend like the breastmilk is non existent.|`|Ot8lxaMEaa	There's nothing wrong with continuing to breastfeed. Breastmilk still has a lot of benefits for her. The WHO recommends continuing until age 2. Its easier to wait until then because they can understand you and that they are "big girls" and dont need to nurse anymore.|`|xApAWlshaa	Dont ween keep breastfeeding.let your child suckle you.the wonderful gift of maternal milk.i know a woman who breastfeeds a 7 year old.maybe you should try to break the record.and go for 10.

PtoieF7Caa	Well "Via" is latin as is "Vado" which is obviously very close to "Vada" so i'm guessing it comes from a country with a latin based language.

SRzswqTeaa	This is a very personal decision - and ultimately it will come down to where you feel most comfortable and safe.  <br>  <br>  Having a homebirth requires that you are healthy and don't have any medical issues that require an OB's care.  <br>  Hospital's will take you either way.  <br>  <br>  Pros of Hospital birth:<br>  Access to pain medications (which in themselves have lots of cons)<br>  <br>  Cons of hospital births:<br>  1-4 chance of cesarean due to the interventions <br>  a chance of having constant fetal monitoring<br>  You have to 'argue' if you want to refuse things like routine IV's, epidurals, constant fetal monitoring, etc.<br>  You are poked and prodded more, which may interrupt labor.<br>  You can't choose your birthing position (such as on a birth chair, or standing up - sometimes even being on all fours).. <br>  You may not be able to video tape the entire birth (many hospitals are not allowing that anymore)<br>  You  will not be allowed to eat during labor - ice chips only<br>  You may only have a certain number of people in the room with you<br>  You and the baby risk getting a hospital based infection<br>  You risk having procedures and interventions done for the sake of covering their behinds.  This may include things like speeding up labor<br>  You may not have the doctor you hired deliver you - and you will most likely not have met the nurses on staff - so ultimately you give birth with strangers (unless you have a doula too) <br>  <br>  Pros of homebirth:<br>  You are allowed to wear what you want, eat when you want, and get into any position you want.<br>  You can have as much family and friend support as you wish<br>  Your baby stays with you, and is not whisked away to nursery.<br>  You can labor AND birth in water<br>  You are not rushed to deliver in a certain amount of time, and interventions are only done when truly necessary. <br>  Women claim that labor is easier and less painful at home<br>  You will have spent much more time with the attending midwife than you would have with an OB - and she will be there for more than the last five minutes of birth.. <br>  Homebirth is as safe (or safer) than a hospital birth<br>  <br>  Cons to homebirth:<br>  If complications arise, you have to transport to hospital  - and that is usually in harder labor which is uncomfortable and sometimes scary depending on the situation.<br>  It can be messy - though midwives do a good job of cleaning up. Occasionally, you have a 'stain' to clean, if you have an oopsie..<br>  ----<br>  I could list more pros and cons for both, but I think that is a good start.  For safety of homebirth websites here are some to get you going: <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.thefarm.org/charities/mid.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.thefarm.org/charities/mid.htm...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.gentlebirth.org/ronnie/homesafe.html#safety" rel="nofollow">http://www.gentlebirth.org/ronnie/homesa...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.nchomebirth.com/art-whatMakesHBdiff.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.nchomebirth.com/art-whatMakes...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.midwiferytoday.com/articles/homebirthissues.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.midwiferytoday.com/articles/h...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.lamaze.org/Research/WhenResearchisFlawed/homebirth/tabid/172/Default.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.lamaze.org/Research/WhenResea...</a>|`|U7Ao0bRdaa	In the hospital at least you have options. If you want a natural birth you can have it, and if something goes wrong and you need to get the baby out you have the doctors Right there to help you. Also if the pain and labor ends up being ot much you can make a choice to have help. I think the big difference is that in the hospital you have a Professional to help if you need it and options.|`|JCWkXn8Aaa	it really depends on what could happen to you, with me i have to go to a hospital because after my son was born i hemmoraged,  and after my daughter was born she inhaled amniotic fluid and got sent to the NICU.

145RUNQHaa	No i've never spanked i have two children and it's not necessary.i hope you reconsider your way of thinking when you do have children if you really know what you are doing as a parent you won't need to spank.the ones playing up in the supermarkets are the ones who get spanked at home don't know why you think otherwise.children who are never spanked but are disciplined in a more civilised and intelligent way are by far more Civilised and respectful no doubt about it.|`|cAtWxJG1aa	If you were only spanked twice in your entire childhood, I'd say it's extremely likely that your parents also used other effective forms of discipline in helping you grow up and learn right from wrong.  Other parents can, too, so I'm not sure why you'd fear for the country just because some particular child might have been spanked two times fewer than you were.<br>  <br>  Empty threats are a terrible idea but certainly not the only option besides spanking.|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	I think that spanking is unnecessary hitting.  Hitting does not teach anything.  It says 'Do what I say because if you don't, I will hit you', not 'Do what I say because it is the right thing to do'.  I want my kids to know how to make good decisions, not how to avoid punishment.|`|nVQGpvuoaa	Spanking, doesn't do something for all kids. My brother got spanked for many years now, and he's 8 and my parents justs stopped because it didn't do anything for him. Its not that I'm against spanking, because its not abusive, but usually it doesn't do anything. I think once your 9, seriously stop spanking them.|`|hKJIDdVqaa	I agree with Mr peters and the ADD/ADHD issues.  Spanking is ok, I feel to jolt a child's attention when nothing else works. should it be used as a constant discipline, No most certainly not.  If you have to always spank something is wrong with your parenting skills.|`|IPl3Yh1kaa	No, I got spankings and hated it :-( . They still make me cringe to this day. However, I am down with discipline and do not want a little hell raising brat running buck wild. I will figure out a medium to 'time out' and 'spanking' and play it by ear when the time comes. There are other means of discipline|`|EtCRnDJMaa	it depends on if i'm in the mood or not and i think maybe 37 should be the cut off<br>  <br>  <br>  i don't think it teaches anything really, and it never works|`|X0ubZnPjaa	i think its fine  when i  was younger i was spanked ..if you dont give them a quick slap they'll think they can get away with what they like. i probably wouldnt hit my kids after the age of about 13-14 but that would depend on how misbehaved they are.<br>  <br>  although it is quite embarrasing spanking your kids in public there been times when ive spanked my kids and people have gave me some really funny looks.|`|LuIFkPfwaa	My siblings and I were spanked and I spanked my kids.  We all turned out fine.  But, spanking should not be used often nor in anger.   <br>  <br>  The time to stop spanking ...  7 would be the outside.  I stopped spanking at about 5.  There were other methods of discipline that worked better by then.|`|0e0a0f1828f99f87ea3d5e5bc8cbd46daa	A BIG FAT NO....there is more than enough time in a child's life to be taught right from wrong, and spanking is not one of them. Be a Parent, and TALK.|`|RuOTJLyvaa	Yeah spanking is fine many kids need it. All this bs you read about kids having ADD or ADHD when all they need is a good smack and a loud "shut up and do your work!"|`|ad9efc98eb0fbeeae6b6c4abfd63046caa	no as its illegal in the united kingdom|`|dDVAUA9saa	You are lumping parents who don't spank into the same category as parents who don't discipline at all, when in fact there is a huge difference.  <br>  <br>  I have never spanked my daughter - but she is only 23 months old.  She is very well behaved and we have never had the need to spank her.  But that does not mean we don't discipline her.  Discipline means teaching your children how to behave, setting limits, following through, being consistent, being positive role models, etc. etc.  It doesn't necessarily mean spanking.  But not spanking does not mean not disciplining.|`|miPubuDYaa	I agree with you spanking is ok when needed.<br>  <br>  My daughter is 7 years old and only needed to be spank twice in her whole life. Once was when she ran into the street with out an adult and once wwas when she punched me in the face and gave me a bloody nose.<br>  <br>  I feel that if that your child putting themselves or someone else in danger a spanking approprate.<br>  <br>  Also i have worked very closely with CPS and spanking here in NY is not considered child abused if it one slap on the rump or hand and doesn't leave mark after 5 minutes. I would never hit my child that hard. But just hard enough to get my point across: like you don't run the street or punch people. <br>  <br>  We normally just take things away when my daughter is misbehaving. You don't eat your breakfast/dinner you do not watch TV that night. She is normally well manner though<br>  <br>  I think the cut off for spanking should be 11 or even 12. However i was spanked as a child and my last spanking was when i was 22 and i completely desevered it.|`|xApAWlshaa	I would not cause my child physical and in the long run mental pain.the fact that your bringing up what your parents did to you proves you still cant forget it and still remember how they spanked you.which is sad.I would never do that to a child.Spanking doesn't just cause physical problems but mainly mental problems.|`|nEsuEbGGaa	I like to grab da little brat n' choke da freakin' life out of him to near death just for fun when i get home from a hard day of laborin'. it helps keep da little spoiled bastard  in check cuz he don't know what he did wrong so's he try's not to do anythin' bad. spankings wid your hand is allright but i found better results with a spiked paddle... really gets in der heads for life you know.|`|TAUYiPpLaa	well just think of it this way, a spanking like abusing your kid, but not to the extreeme. if you have to dicipline them, do it in an easier nice way. take something away from them, say for instance, tv for that night, or a video game or something. cause you know, they're still only kids and there just trying to learn. so teach them, dont hurt them.|`|e9kvxIc3aa	I believe in it as an absolute last resort!! It just seems the thing to do sometimes...I would never make a habit of it...but a good smack on the butt never destroyed anyone!!|`|1pbTmda6aa	I have to say, I was one of those parents that hated seeing misbehaved children in stores.  I thought I had it all figured out with my first child because he was so well behaved.  I did use spanking when it was needed, which was rarely ever and usually just a pat on the butt.<br>  <br>  Then, like a slap in the face, my 2nd child was one of those kids that I so dreaded hearing in the store.  She was and still is horrible and no amount of spanking or time outs has put fear into her.  She will get punished for something and turn right around and do it later.  She is truly hard headed and though she fears the punishment at the time, it must not affect her too much long term.<br>  <br>  One thing a parent must remember...each child is different and so will be your methods for discipline and reward.|`|KAVLHokbaa	I wasn't given spankings when i was little, I was beat till I was black and blue and most of the time it was for spilling something and half the time I can't remember why he whipped me. It was ridiculous...I don't believe that you have to hit your kids to get them to mind, if you do, you are not a good parent or you are hitting them for the wrong reason. I believe spankings should be given when they are young maybe up until age 7 like you said. I know kids who have never had a spanking who are great kids and turned out great but I also know some people who were spanked all the time and turned out terrible and beat their kids. It's all a matter of opinion but mine is that you should spank your kids when they are smaller but not cause bruises and whatnot. That's just stupid! When they are older, you should ground them and have talks with them and let them know why what they did was wrong and that it won't be accepted.|`|WWhYCAbSaa	Spanking is fine when needed.  If done correctly, it won't happen often.  <br>  <br>  I don't think there's a specific age to stop.  If a 14 year old is going to act like a two year old and throw a screaming fit, then they are to be treated as such, and get punished like they were two.<br>  <br>  I would spank my kids, illegal or not.  Kids don't care what's right and wrong.  Try reasoning with a two year old.  Doesn't work.|`|aGYvN9pfaa	I agree with a limited amount of corporal punishment at a young age because when a child is too young, words and reason don't necessarily get through. Their minds aren't yet developed enough to work that way. I don't feel comfortable with a butt spanking though and my reasons are long and complicated (won't get into it here). I prefer a slap on the wrist or hand with a stern "no". Enough so that it startles the child and stings a little but doesn't really hurt. This lets them associate bad actions with discomfort, rather than pain. I don't want to be associated as a punisher who inflicts pain. But I agree. At 7, their cognitive abilities should be developed enough that they can reason why their actions are wrong and they shouldn't need another physical stimulus to emphasize the point.

I am in the same boat. I never wanted to be a co-sleeper but loved being close to him. Then the storkcraft issue with cribs came around and I didnt feel safe letting him sleep in his bed anymore. So my son has been sleeping in our bed for about 2 months now... waiting for parts!<br>  <br>  As far as getting some sleep so you dont fall asleep in class tonight... can you get hubby or a friend to take care of baby for a few hours so you can go get some shut eye? You might not get solid sleep during the day but its probably better than nothing.<br>  <br>  And for getting him back to the play pen... is it in your room? maybe if you put him right beside you it might be easier. I'm guessing if he is 8 months old he is probably too big for the basinett in the playpen, if you have one, but maybe for a couple nights its a good option. This way he will be up right by you but contained.

I think babies and toddlers should sleep in their own beds. Parent's should start making their babies sleep in their own beds early so they will be used to it. Once you start letting them sleep with you, they never want to leave. My stepson was used to sleeping with his mom so when he'd come over on the weekends he would always climb in the bed with us. He was 5 years old! I hated that. Loved him, but hated having him in the bed with us because he kicked, pushed, and snored in his sleep.|`|K7VfjSspaa	why dont you try to have or move in a bigger bed then?I sleep with my son too,since he was born.if im not tired,i dont mind having a koala hugging me all night.if im tired,just give him a big pillow to hug.|`|DzPZ8EEkaa	As hard as it will be for you, and trust me I understand, you simply have to tough it out.  Put him in his "crib" to sleep.  There are several methods for doing so, easing into it, the cold turkey approach, etc.  My husband and I went for the semi-cold turkey approach with our son.  I should more accurately say my husband did because I simply didn't have the heart to let him cry.  I had to go to an area of the house where I couldn't hear him or else he would have been sleeping with us until his 10th b-day, hahaha!  But seriously, it truly is better for an older child and since he is 8 months old I would begin now.  The older he gets, the harder it will be.  I'm sure you already know that.  I would try reading some books or Google(ing) the different methods.  It will be very hard for you.  There is no getting around that, but you can do it.  Oh, one other thing, no matter what method you choose (if you choose to stop co-sleeping), one thing is always always always going to be true and that is consistency!!!!!!!!  Be consistent down to the tiniest of details.  If you say, "Good night, sleep tight, see you in the morning light" then you say that every single night because that lets him know that just like the night and morning before, there you are!!!  You really do come back!!!  Good luck!  I hope this helps.  We need our rest too as parents in order to function and be the best parents we can be.

j0xfBk5Caa	I'm a member, big shock I know ;-) When I am there I am being my adopted self but I have to admit that my nmom self has aha! moments quite often. As much as I love connecting with other adoptees it is painful to see the effects of adoption. I can relate, offer support, b*tch and laugh with everyone else but I often feel like an outsider looking in. It is hard to know the pain adoption can cause an adoptee and know that I have also forced that pain on my own flesh and blood. It's like a constant duel inside my head. Often I find myself unable to type or add anything to a conversation because my nmom self gets caught up in a battle with my adoptee self. I also belong to the Origins Canada group and forum and I try to use that arena to vent my emotions as a nmom but it still leaks through to my adoptee activities. I think our forum allows for me to gain much needed insight into how other adoptees feel and that will be crucial once I am able to reunite with my son but it makes me feel so guilty to use the forum to gain that insight.|`|JP04HX6maa	monkeykitty: "Am I incorrect about that? Do adoptees actually WANT non-adoptees to read these forums? I would be perfectly willing to; I was just trying to be respectful of privacy."<br>  <br>  You could. I mean, nobody can stop you, obviously.<br>  <br>  It's just you might read some stuff on there you won't like, or that will scare you, or make you feel defensive. It's pretty raw over there. *shrugs* (It's not like it's a Q&A forum for adoptees to broadcast their personal details for any enquiring minds)|`|yEzCKWzEaa	I read there, but am not a member.  It's my understanding that it is specifically for adoptees so I read to learn as much as I can without intruding on the forum. <br>  <br>  There are other forums, such as Adoption Threads,  but they include all members of the "triad" which I don't find very helpful.|`|7JEojMgQaa	I have been hanging around there for almost a year I think. I have learned sooo much, and it makes sense. Things I had never given thought to suddenly being brought to light from first hand perspectives. I really haven't tried any where else, I'm more interested in what the adoptee's perspective is.|`|kf7XLE8kaa	Ditto what Freckle Face said.  I'm a member and I read often.  There are times, quite often, when I really, REALLY want to throw in my two cents (mainly in the vomitrocious section, when something really chaps my hide), but I have to remind myself that I *have* a safe place, and this is not it.  I have posted a few times (and probably stepped on a few toes until I understood the above statement...oops!), but for the most part, I just read and learn, and send out silent support.<br>  <br>  I have not found a place where I was comfortable as a PAP.  I belonged to a few message boards for years where I got a lot of support.  But after I started learning about the adoptee perspective, I no longer fit in on these message boards, where adoption is generally seen as altruistic and beautiful.  And all of the boards that I belonged to for adoption of special needs children (which counts for most of said message boards) tend to follow the line of thinking that it's the child's fault, or the natural family's fault, for not attaching or having emotional troubles.  I found one message board that I loved for about a month, but slowly began to realize that many of the members there were just plain rude (in a passive aggressive, "what, I didn't say anything!" way), and that this was not only acceptable, but encouraged.  I left that board, but I know that there are some members here who are also members there and they do find support there.<br>  <br>  My safe place has nothing to do with adoption, but adoption has been discussed from time to time.  Usually from the perspective of the adoptee or first parent, and usually not in the "altruistic, beautiful" rainbows and puppies language.  So, the only adoption related message board I belong to right now is the adult adoptee forum.  Works for me.|`|7aCH91ISaa	I was briefly a member, but felt like I was invading a space that was supposed to be just for adoptees. I do occasionally pop in and check things out. I find that this is probably the most realistic website about adoption. No farting unicorns...<br>  <br>  I know my son has checked it out also, because he asked me about some of the topics on there and what my thoughts were. I don't know if he actually joined though. <br>  <br>  I am a member at Adoptionthreads and I do like it.  But feel like I have to bite my tongue sometimes because I am afraid that my not so rosy view of adoption will tick someone off. Although there are quite a few AP's there that seem to "get it".|`|E7MgO2pZaa	I was invited there by someone who is both a member here at Yahoo! answers and at AAAFC. I went and signed up and I LOVE it! I didn't know there was something like that by and for adoptees before. It's so validating to hear that I'm not crazy for feeling sad, lonely, or angry because of relinquishment! <br>  <br>  I'm really glad and privelged to be part of such a great group of people who really "get" it and have been such a great support even in the short time I've been a member.|`|BTuFtui3aa	I'm aware that it exists, but I haven't read it because I assumed that adoptees would want to keep it as a private space where they could air their thoughts without being judged, and I totally support people having that.<br>  <br>  Am I incorrect about that? Do adoptees actually WANT non-adoptees to read these forums? I would be perfectly willing to; I was just trying to be respectful of privacy.|`|AKJwWqdZaa	As an adoptive mom, I read there quite often, however, I am not a member.<br>  <br>  There are many places for PAPs and APs to go for support:<br>  chinaadopttalk.com<br>  adoptionthreads.com<br>  informedadoptions.com<br>  canadaadopttalk.com|`|in6Iw3BEaa	Yes, I've been there.  What's surprising is it is not all about adoption, I love that!  There's some fun stuff to look at there.  And not to mention, a lot of familiar names.|`|WEekT4b6aa	never heard of it before.<br>  maybe i should check it out, but I have to talk to my angel to make sure I wasn't duplicating what she's doing.<br>  cw|`|Ah6FJHkWaa	I can barely keep up here, but will give it a try.|`|93Rbgno0aa	I've looked there. I wasn't completely sure I should be there, I felt like a peeping tom.  <br>  <br>  I belong to a few groups for parents who've adopted older children internationally, and I find those very helpful. <br>  <br>  Recently one of my groups has been working to set up either a yahoo group or facebook group for children adopted from my children's country. They want it to be a place where the children can talk without the parents having access, so they can really say what they feel.  But on the other hand, privacy & safety are a concern since we're talking children 8/9 and up so we're checking around for reliable younger adults we know to moderate. If we can work it, my children are very excited about that idea.|`|Jy2RF9Szaa	I am an AP and I have been a member there for a long time. I read pretty regularly, though I rarely post. (When the board started APs were invited to read and learn, with the caveat that it was a support forum for adoptees and not an "ask-an-adoptee" educational service for APs. I felt like a voyeur as a guest though, so I signed up. At least now if I'm reading your thread, you'll know it's me!) <br>  <br>  There are lots of places online for adoptive parents. All of them have their benefits and disadvantages, but I think there is some useful information to be gleaned from most (and some trash at most, too).<br>  <br>  ETA about whether it's appropriate for APs to be on the site: This is from the forum's mission statement "This is not an adoptive parent support network. Adoptive parents are welcome here if their goal is to learn about the adoptee’s experience in order for them to better parent their adopted child. We support little adoptees. We want adoptive parents to learn from our experiences and encourage them to read our stories: without judgment, and with full awareness that this forum is here for our support and not for their education. Their education is ancillary, a benefit they may reap from reading our support threads." <br>  <br>  There are also private sections of the boards that are restricted to adoptees only. Even as a registered member, I do not have (nor have I requested) access to those areas since I'm not an adoptee. I don't feel bad about being there, but I did feel guilty about being there "anonymously" as a guest -- and a feel an obligation to be careful/respectful about what/when I post.|`|Alyvp37Maa	Hi Sunny,<br>  <br>  Yes, I've checked it out and I love it!<br>  <br>  There is so much information over there:)  I read, absorb and giggle.  I am a member but i do not post out of respect.<br>  <br>  There are many forums for adoptive parents but none that i find have the camaraderie and cohesiveness as adult adoptees.|`|xKSr1ld8aa	A thumbs up from me as I am a member there although I haven't posted in ages.  <br>  <br>  'Nother for adoptees, natural parents, adoptive parents, foster carers, extended family and partners is www.touchedbyadoptionforums.com - click on forums near the top of the page.|`|RfeDshAxaa	I am aware of the Adoptee forum, and have checked it out regularly for quite awhile now.<br>  <br>  As a PAP, I find a lot of useful information from informedadoptions.com and adoptionthreads.com.|`|993127072b7a2a0e8c555efdb241a674aa	im there all the time!! its a wonderful place with lots of diversity. we talk about everything. <br>  <br>  i have made some of the greatest friends there. even some in real life.|`|a095159fe0597a1cbcdff915d247b333aa	I have, yes. I haven't posted, however.|`|9Ng5sqpnaa	I am a first mother and can honestly say that I knew it was there but haven't really felt the need to read there. I'll have to check it out. <br>  <br>  I am in 3 groups for just first mothers. We are pretty candid and open with each other about our experiences, perception and opinions. <br>  <br>  A couple of the natural mother groups I'm in are considered  a bit radical but I feel safe enough there to say just about anything and not be judged. I would not feel that way in a group with APs and sometimes even w/adoptees. Some of my feelings are just too painful to share with anyone other than those who have experienced it.
mc6YtaRbaa	You can write on them, but don't press hard. If you do, it can imprint on the other side so if you look at it at certain angels you'll see it. Since you are scrap booking you can also just make your own border for them and put the date on there.
96HWpdkFaa	Wow never heard of this.<br>  Lol<br>  My baby is due in September..so we'll see.
hKJIDdVqaa	Ithink people should be respected in general.  Unless they do something that warrants loss of respect, then it has to be earned back, if possible.|`|Xzvoz6mcaa	It's both.  If it is your parents or someone like that, respect is deserved for the most part.  If it is a friend or someone you don't know very well, respect is earned. And yes, probably everyone deserves a small level of respect until you find out if they really do deserve it yet or need to earn it.|`|60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	I was just thinking the same exact thing while reading some answers to that question.  I believe it is deserved.  It's kinda like trust, you have it until you lose it.|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	The noun, 'respect', has a variety of meanings: <a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/respect[1]" rel="nofollow">http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionar...</a>   So, it can be interpreted in different ways.  <br>  <br>  The Unitarian Universalist principles say it pretty well for me - I believe in the inherent worth and dignity of every person.  And, to me, that is 'respect' that is deserved.  Every person deserves to be treated with that level of respect.  <br>  <br>  Then, there is the respect that is more along the lines of 'admiration'.  That type of respect is something that a person earns from others (or *does not earn*), by their actions, knowledge, experiences, wisdom, abilities, etc.|`|EtCRnDJMaa	yes everybody deserves respect, but I think it's a different type of respect you're talking about for strangers vs the people you know and who are family and friends.  I think respect is earned and should never be demanded.  Holding doors for people should be done no matter what, we all should behave with respect when out in the world among strangers.  It is a different type of respect though, i think.  <br>  <br>  To me everybody has my respect until they lose it.|`|cAtWxJG1aa	i'm totally with you.  everyone's entitled to a level of basic respect as a human being.  i also agree that higher levels of respect have to be earned.|`|xNkmK0SHaa	The question DESERVES more than a two word answer, so here I go:<br>  <br>  "However I think everyone, even complete strangers deserve a certain level of common courtesy and respect. Human nature is to be selfish. To think of yourself first."<br>  <br>  I strenuously disagree with the above.  There is a huge difference between common courtesy and respect. And I don't believe that it is "human nature" to be selfish.  Selfishness is born of some genetic predisposition, but mostly early childhood experiences. <br>  <br>  "and treat others with respect. (For example holding doors, saying please and thank you, helping someone in need load their groceries- the list could go on and on)"<br>  <br>  I consider the above "common courtesy", something we seemingly fail to teach our young.  Pity. <br>  <br>  I grew up in the era of "respect your elders".  Well, I am here to tell you that there are many "elders" who deserve NO respect.<br>  <br>  I could write a book.  Oh, I have, but not on this subject.|`|cYRZpGkqaa	I think that's it's a combination of both. Strangers (for the most part) haven't done you wrong, and you probably don't know them well enough to judge them, which I believe is a form of disrespect. I hold doors any time I get the chance. I know that helping strangers in even the smallest of ways can really make their day.<br>  I think that respect in a family relationship really is a bit of both. You deserve respect from your children, but you have to teach them right from wrong, therefore earning it at the same time. <br>  I hope made sense. Sometimes traveling from my mouth to other people's ears makes me sound a little crazy. Lol.|`|j2mRop0laa	I think respect is deserved of everyone (except those that are property of the state- then the state or country determines the level of respect that the criminal receives).<br>  <br>  I mean, I wouldn't go around kicking a crack head or yelling at someone because they weren't dressed appropriately. They deserve the same level of respect, in my opinion. Respect of their space, their body etc. <br>  <br>  Everyone deserves a basic amount of respect, but I think it's also fine to be disrespectful of people who hurt you/ invade you/ or disrespect you.|`|prqrQcd1aa	I see holding doors, saying please and thank you and helping others as common courtesy..or common respect for humanity if you will.<br>  Respect to it's fullest term is something that does have to be earned, or can be taken away. Example" I can say please and thank you and help my mother out when she needs help, but because of the way that she is I have no respect for her!|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	i think respect is a given until something happens to take it away.  respect on the road - let a driver get over when they have a blinker on.  flip them off when they cut you off.  respect and not respect.<br>  <br>  i think earning respect comes from people who have broken it.  i respect the feelings of a newborn what have they done to earn it?  nothing it just is.  now a teenager who sneaks out of the house after bedtime, needs to earn respect back.  <br>  <br>  my two cents|`|0vLU2GGGaa	i agree with you.  Everyone should deserve basic respect.|`|9fDkrrFyaa	agreed|`|tae4IGumaa	both|`|2NRCJgq2aa	Respect as you use it in your illustration is being considerate of others.  In order to have someone hold you in high regard - you have to earn their respect - and you don't do that by opening the door for them once at the market.<br>  <br>  There's a difference between kindness, consideration, and offering someone high regard.  That's earned through consistent and reliable action.|`|F7tyzrMzaa	Hmm... I get what you mean. I do believe there's a certain amount of respect that is deserved. I do hold open doors for people etc, even if I don't know them, because it's the curteous thing to do. Just slamming a door on someone's face is rude. <br>  <br>  However, beyond that, most needs to be earned. For example, my stepfather tries making stupid rules for me, even when I don't live with them. He doesn't treat me with ANY respect, yet expects me to follow all his rules and give him the respect that I don't get. Doesn't happen. If you treat someone with respect, then you deserve respect in return.|`|7jxbpo0Qaa	This is a great question for young parents.<br>  <br>  Respect is to be given to everyone regardless of earned or not.  Lack of respect for others says more about YOU than about the other person.  I raised my girls to respect all ppl not just the ones that DESERVE it.  If they only showed respect to the ones that earned it then...they would have turned out like a lot of these unruly, selfish kids that are in the news every day.|`|f401ea307e44f234284f4730f9d3f181aa	Some stranger out in the middle of nowhere cannot earn your respect, so it would automatically be deserved! However, if someone closer to you, did you wrong, then it would have to be earned back if they want it! So I guess I agree with you?!!|`|PxawVQ7Xaa	When meeting strangers you should talk polietly, hold doors open etc, but with people you are with every day such as teachers and parents, then they must show respect as well, not think they can treat people "below" them like sh*t and expect them too bow down to them.|`|e2f691f969692b780512a057905a00c5aa	I 100 % agree with you. I expect to be given and be treated human, just like i would treat you or anyone else. respect is not earned but given in a humanely and dignified way.|`|9QVjNaIPaa	thats a tough one. i think respect is deserved but once you do something to disrespect the person giving you respect, you then need to earn it if you want it back again.|`|BCRNnk8Gaa	you earn respect, but that doesn't mean you can disrespect someone because they have not earned it from you already|`|wPD3BGEHaa	Earned most definitely..|`|SwoRqEZvaa	I totally agree with you. i saying that I have to earn someones respect for them to hold the elevator for me|`|KOwzDLPdaa	I think once you have earned someone's respect, you deserve it :-)|`|cKy6yLDMaa	E A R N E D ! ! !|`|e9kvxIc3aa	Earned...definitely!|`|87gGT9EHaa	its earned|`|Lor20kXcaa	Everyone deserves a certain level of politeness, but that is not respect, that is manners. <br>  Respect and manners are completely different things to me. <br>  Respect is admiration, gratitude, wondering if you can do as well as so and so.<br>  Manners is having the common courtesy to treat people nicely. <br>  Manners is not about respect, it's simply a nice way to treat people. <br>  Holding the door open isn't respect, helping someone with shopping isn't respect. <br>  <br>  Respect is about someones idea's, their philosophy, their determination, what they have done in their life. <br>  <br>  I don't respect the random old man in front of me at the queue, for all i know he could be an ex-nazi camp guard, the old lady could be an ex-prostitute....<br>  But i still treat them well, until i have reason not to.<br>  <br>  I still don't respect them.<br>  <br>  I respect people like my MIL, who worked her butt of through two pregnancies to put a house over her sons head.<br>  I respect my severely dyslexic friend, who is a professional designer. He struggles to write his own name, yet he has earned millions of dollars. <br>  <br>  That is respect... Manners are just manners.|`|MPQCX5yhaa	Respect is earned, when a stranger approaches and is respectful towards you they are earning your respect. Now if they approach in a hostile manner, the respect is out the window. For ex., if my shopping cart is in the middle of the aisle and someone is approaching in a respectful manner, I going to respect them and move it, if I haven't already before they've arrived. If they're cursing at me before I get a chance to move it, I may not be as respectful. Respect is earned by how you approach people. <br>  <br>  No one has to hold the door open for you, if so, they are going above and beyond...doing a good deed. And it tells a lot about their character.<br>  <br>  Besides, whenever, I hear respect is deserve, I think of that old lady who's just plain rude but you have to respect her because she's your elder. So you have no choice but to let her walk all over you and remain silent because it's disrespectful to question your elders.|`|7VWy9DTQaa	Respect should be deserved sometimes...but only when it's earned haha. Respect from others is considered a privelege, and if you want it, you need to put forth the effort to obtain it.|`|4TJBfXwAaa	Its earned
a9388aa832e1b42ed43cb15b336d3cbcaa	She is seeking attention and testing you. She wants to see if you will come running every time she does it. Babies are really smart and they often test their limits. This is a method of exploring their world and learning new things. If you don't want this particular behavior to continue let her cry (unless it is truly time to get her out of the crib), in doing this you are sending her a message that crying won't always fix it. She may even find a new way to play.|`|gvqzwUUgaa	Because shes a baby =D.|`|mDYsr62maa	Well, I'm just an old grandpa but if the idea is to get her to stop, try duct taping the toys to the crib.  Use enough to wrap the tape around the bars 3 or 4 times or they can pull the tape loose.  On a related note.  Olive oil gets duct tape out of hair.<br>  <br>  OK I got some feed back on the duct tape idea so I'm thinking Bungee Cords.  Not only do the toys come back but it helps the baby learn to duck.|`|PA7LOoQ9aa	i think she is pushing you!! she knows if she wimpers you'll come a running... i would try to let her lay there and cry it out. dont go in everytime. if she falls asleep after crying it out and wakes up again do it go in check on her and give her the toys. but dont go in every single time make a limit as to how much you get up and do it, it will teach her your not going to jump everytime and help her to break the patteren. its probably a phase in a couple weeks she'll be into something new.!!!
zQ7T04gSaa	I just had the same experience as you! I had unprotected sex on the 1st and 2nd of march and i think i ovulated around the same time but im not sure. I have abnormal cycles 2. what i did was a went to the doctor and he is going to do a blood test to see the hormone levels however he did say that it might be to soon. I really hope the best for you. you could be pregnant.....we could both be pregnant lol! if this time it doesnt work lets try and get illegal fertility drugs together *wink* ;) just kidding!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!... lol

XhIYAH6Laa	I had a constant headache for the first few weeks of my current pregnancy. They lasted all day, they were very minor, but were definitely there all day. It freaked me out so I went to my regular doctor, but assured me it was very normal and take tylenol as directed (which doesn't help me at all). Eventually it went away and I haven't had one since (12 weeks today).Good Luck.|`|yB5go5wbaa	I did, but I attributed that to cutting coffee out of my diet.  I had nausea from day 1 and had bleeding gums! weird symptom.|`|BhZmRJSBaa	i didnt find out i was pregnant until i was like 5 weeks. i was taking midol because i thought i was just starting my period ( i always got periods before i started ) but it is pretty normal to get headaches. you can take tylenol for them that helps me. Good Luck =D|`|u1DDrXO2aa	firstly ever women is different i didnt show signs until i was 3 months with a little morning sickness about 4 times...I dont know how far along you are but a headache has to do with your hormones changing and adjusting to being pregnant!|`|Eqln1jmNaa	oh yes, but I of course had to get migraines and still do today at 25 weeks! it sucks... just take one tylenol and it should help|`|v5QU33SVaa	not prego haha|`|NZuznqfiaa	Yes I had headaches my whole first trimester ranging from minor to really bad. They will get better as the pregnancy goes along but they stink!!
9ydJQr5zaa	He is not your son as you said he is your stepson, which means that you do not have any rights towards doing any type of discipline to him. You should try to inform your husband about the situation and try to tell him what is going and how you feel and what you would like to change. Unless your husband agrees with you spanking him then go ahead. But if he doesn't there is nothing you should do besides wait for your husband to take action on his own. After all it is his kid.|`|a8e2130188e45facab4c16a4a764104caa	Part of the problem here in Yahoo!Answers could be the problem of "language". I mean, some of us get confused when you have what most consider to be a "man's name" [Frank] and yet you clearly consider yourself a woman and your stepson considers you to be "a slut woman".<br>  <br>  Most definitely you, a woman, should NOT spank a teen-age son. That is more a father's duty.  And to spank a STEPson, and you probably have only been part of the family for a little while, is totally UNreal. <br>  <br>  WHY does your stepson think of you as "a slot woman"???<br>  .
Drg3bLjUaa	At 35 weeks your baby is quite large and this can put extra pressure on your back and pelvis...unfortunately as the next few weeks are basically your baby putting on more weight and as the baby's head will be turning into the birth canal your back problem may get worse :( Many women suffer from back ache in pregnancy...I think your doctor is being very judgemental and unsympathetic cant you change docs?|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	Well it's really hard to say what is causing your back pain. But, it is most likely just from being pregnant unless you are having other symptoms. Mine's killing me all of the time at this point as well, and I'm 35 weeks as well. There's not much you can do about it. You could try a warm bath and/or heating pad or have someone massage you. If it keeps hurting you might consider going to see a chiropractor or getting a massage, both of those help me a lot!<br>  <br>  Also, if you don't like your doctor, why are you still going to him? There's no way I could have a professional relationship with someone I thought was judging me about something as trivial as having tattoos.|`|Z8mmsOIqaa	sometimes due to where the baby sits in your pelvis it can cause pretty severe back pain, I am sorry your Dr. is not helping you, I would consider changing your doctor and maybe loging a complaint with his office, that is very unprofessional.  <br>  <br>  Try doing some simple stretches for your back (easier said than done I know) lie on the floor and let your knees fall together one direction (gently) hold for a few seconds then center them then let them fall the other direction DO NOT force them to the ground you could pull you muscles in your lower back.<br>  <br>  You may also want to look into prenatal massage in your area, they have clinics specializing in pain management due to pregnancy.

w6BdsKRbaa	even i had pains like period pain during my initial days of pregnancy but later it went away. just dont panic, sometimes the pain is just the uterus and the associated muscles preparing itself for the baby. the important thing is u dont panic, remain happy, eat well and get plenty of rest.God bless!|`|MvMT8TD3aa	Its probably your body getting ready to carry your baby. I had this pain and thought i had an eptopic pregnancy however i went and saw my midwife and she advised it was my body growing. This was at 7 weeks so your not too far off that. Good Luck xox|`|Zi1mKepCaa	your only  four weeks along, even if you were having a miscarriage it wouldnt be painful.|`|BhZmRJSBaa	your body probably is just adjusting to the pain. i had the same feeling. it is nothing to worry about! Good Luck! =D
x18w912Xaa	It was about 6 days after my missed period. Two lines came up faster than black friday shoppers busting down the doors @ 5am lol|`|dOQ5yipDaa	Do you mean how many months where we trying for? Or how late I was after my period was due?<br>  <br>  If it was how many months we were trying - it was 9 months.<br>  <br>  If it was how long after my period was due - that was 2 days. It was due on the 13th it didnt come I tested and it was negative, tested the 14th negative - finally on the 15th when it was 2 days late I got the positive.|`|596ddaee42df0ec8a6b9d7b4242c6338aa	I was three weeks late before I had a BFP.  I even had a negative blood test when I was a few days late.|`|qJaKF24naa	usually 2 weeks after conception date, Normally you can get a positive the first day of a missed period and some people can find out a few days before.
UHXNA1Imaa	I feel well qualified to answer your question as I have been in a similar situation.<br>  <br>  Although I was married and we had a home together, I and three children (one still in nappies) suddenly found ourselves without a mother and a wife.<br>  <br>  I would be lying if i said it was not a struggle to begin with, but as time went on things got better and better and I was glad that I had not taken the advice of several relations, friends and social workers to have them split up and brought up elsewhere.<br>  <br>  Even though I had the children already, I do feel our circumstances are quite similar.<br>  <br>  Having a good deal of money in order to bring up a child may not be as important as some people think.<br>  <br>  You want to have the baby so please have a good talk about your feelings with your boyfriend. The ultimate decision whether to go ahead and have the baby must be yours though.<br>  <br>  Many families have children and live on a shoe-string budget but the child, or chidlren, do not suffer in any way. I know many in such a position and they and their children are happy and the family relationship is extremely strong and loving. Neither do the children have to truly go without.<br>  <br>  The important thing is that he/she is brought into a loving and caring relationship, that is the most vital part of parenthood.<br>  <br>  Although your baby may not have the very, very best of everything and you both will likely not be able to do some of the things you would normally do if you did not have a child, having a baby, loving, caring for it and watching it grow I am sure you will agree is far more satisfying.<br>  <br>  You say you can't afford to be a single mum, from that I am assuming you and your boyfriend do not live together. If you do decide to have the baby are you likely to find a place to live together?<br>  <br>  If this does not happen and you both do live apart, although you may be classed as a 'single mum' you must remember that your boyfriend is legally obliged to provide at least financial help toward the baby and maybe to yourself too. However I am quite sure that you and he are aware of this and I am sure he will.<br>  <br>  I applaud your decision to 'go-it-alone and not burden your parents as they have a great mountain to climb already with your father being so ill.<br>  <br>  I truly wish you the best of luck and feel confident you will reach the right decision and if you do decide to have your baby I pray you have a trouble free pregnancy and confinement.<br>  <br>  John<br>  (Poseidon)|`|NlBu6NfPaa	it depends what morals you hold, some people would see having an abortion as taking an innocent life while other people may say that they have perfectly just reasons to have abortions.<br>  <br>  would you be able to handle it if you had an abortion? would you be able to leave with aborting the baby? would you regret aborting the baby later on in your life? those are the questions you have to ask, if you answer no then don't have an abortion.<br>  <br>  If you want the baby have the baby. don't be pushed into any decision by someone, ever. you've got to do what you believe is right not what someone else believes is right.<br>  <br>  I hope you make the right choice for yourself.|`|Ccq8zEcnaa	Well that's kind of disappointing to see a couple that actually planned to bring a child into this world, and as easy as it came, they're ready to just let it all go. There are Federal and State programs out there to help single parents, struggling parents. I think you will seriously regret having an abortion later on down the road. I say try to make things work. There are people out there that are in worse situations than you and they make it. Maybe your boyfriend should look for a better paying job, or work two jobs until the baby is a little older.|`|5cfrig5Eaa	then you should have waited till you could have afforded the baby it is not the baby's fault that he or she was made it has a purpose to be here let it live i to am a Single parent and yes it is hard but we get by i think you should have the baby and give it to someone that Truly wants one and that can afford it and when things is good then try again until then use condoms so this don't happen again|`|8938823b93c7a8fab3771af7c8ebf1e7aa	It sounds like he has cold feet.  The reality of actually having a baby as oposed to talking about having one is a very scary thing.<br>  <br>  Dont have the abortion just because he says you cant afford it.  People always find a way to afford it.  You will be no exception.  You will get help from the government.  Sort your debts out now, before the baby is born and go see the Citizens Advice who will tell you everything you are entitled to.  You will be surprised!!<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|8sg43Yh3aa	If you want the baby, keep it! Money isn't everything and you will get by, people do it all the time and get by. You just have to make cut backs. I am 22 weeks pregnant and petrified about money, but there is no way I would get rid of the baby because of money issues. Everything will work out. And I am a great believer that things happen for a reason! Good luck!!!|`|FwmhrrVdaa	Don't listen to him. It's a baby your talking about here! You are 5 weeks pregnant, you have a life growing inside you. If you abort it you'll kill that life. That life has a right to live. There will be a way out for finance after you have this baby. <br>  <br>  I had a friend who had an abortion for the same reason. Everyday of her life she regrets it and apparently it haunts her. So please take my advice and keep the baby. DON'T KILL IT!|`|oEoUBq7Haa	You should dump the no good piece of Sh*t. If he would have kept his dick in his pants he wouldnt have to worry about it. You have to think about the human being you have inside you. The precious baby that has your life inside it. Your boyfriend needs to grow up and take responsibility of what he made. and youre responsible for it too. Do you wanna be a murderer. A mureder of your own child? PoorBaby. if its that big of a deal put it up for adoption. thats all i got to say : (|`|b8f0CfSsaa	For the debt you can get an IVA. It will be on your record forever, but from the sounds of things you will go bankrupt anyway so an IVA may help you.<br>  <br>  If you want the baby then keep the baby!!! No one can make you do anything and an abortion is something you will have to live with forever.|`|F8O1V1Bcaa	Abortion is a difficult decision. So is having a baby. But, if you really want this baby, I'd advise against it. You might regret it. There are people who can help you with the debt.|`|MKWrLkH8aa	He's just running scared. If you want the baby, you keep it, it's that simple. Everything else will take care of itself.|`|5rRgcedhaa	have the baby you will find ways to cope but will never get over not haven the baby|`|AA12099603	he is just scared....... and whether you do it with him or without him, you'll manage.<br>  dont let him push you into an abortion...... make your own decision.......<br>  Good luck <br>  xXx|`|AP2FnaWcaa	How old are you first?<br>  <br>  Im sorry and i dont mean to sound mean, but do you not think its worse to bring a baby into the world that isnt going to have a proper upbringing than having an abortion (after all the baby hasnt even developed yet!)<br>  <br>  And you should of thought about this first. It sounds like you're being selfish, because you want the baby, it isnt toy!!! And i have to agree with your boyfriend, atleast he's thought about it! I hate it when people have kids for the sake of it and then cant support their children financially. And do you think your family need this at this point too?<br>  <br>  If you have this baby, you'll only end up being on the bloody jeremy kyle show this time next year!<br>  <br>  Dont do it, dont be so evil to the unborn baby!|`|Jf3DIPcNaa	If everyone waited till they were all set financially, there would be hardly any babies on this earth. There are ways you can get help with the expenses of having a baby. He sounds like he's trying to back out when it is already too late. You do not have to get an abortion. <br>  <br>  We were very tight financially when I got pregnant and then I got laid off from my job a few weeks ago and now we are really gonna struggle for a while because it's gonna be almost impossible to find a job around here with all the layoffs. You cut out the stuff you don't need and find ways to save money on things you do need. We turned our heat way down, we stopped eating out, we changed our habits to lower our bills, we are only buying the necessities for our baby and I bought most of the clothes at second hand stores or on sale really cheap. <br>  <br>  It's do-able. You just need to work out your finances and be smart about it. And debt or not, if my man was trying to force me into an abortion with a baby we had planned for, I would tell him figure out the money or I'm gone. Don't get rid of your baby. You want your baby. Your baby is more important than money and a guy who is being a jerk.|`|qYTvet0Taa	Hi girl, think about it a baby is not something u can make everyday or even every year. If u have an abortion ur gonna regret it sometime in ur life. I've been trying 4 a baby for over 6 years I got pregnant a year ago but had a miscarriage. Think a baby is a blessing, and u guys might be struggling money wise but there's many places that can help u with money 4 ur baby. Ask someone at ur nearest clinic or hospital u'll be amazed to see how much they can help. And if u think u'll end up being a single mom talk to ur boyfriend and/or seek help w friends and family. <br>  Wish u the best, and hope u make the right decission whatever makes u happy.<br>  Good luck!|`|LKIhUMCgaa	i'm pro-choice, and i'm not gonna say it's murder if u decide to abort, but if u guys were trying to conceive it, u're most likely going to regret having an abortion. me and my b/f can't really afford our baby either right now. everyone has been tight w/ money, but i know we'll get by. u can always look into government help, also see if u can talk to the bank bout ur debt, maybe there is a way to lower ur interests or maybe even cut down the debt so u can pay it off.|`|8VaSOTfnaa	Mothers ALWAYS find a way!|`|MHg9JhEKaa	If you really want the baby, don't have an abortion hun, you'll regret it.  <br>  <br>  He has to take responsibility, you both agreed to try for a baby it's too late for him to back out now you're pregnant! What if you went ahead with the abortion, and then he decides to change his mind again? <br>  <br>  I expect he is just having jitters and isn't enjoying the pressure. Reassure him. Have an indepth look at what help etc is available to you. It would be interesting to know how he has come to this conclusion... sounds to me more like he's looking for an easy way out.|`|XSP24wJ7aa	If you want the baby then have it. Don't let him push you into a abortion You'll regret it and then end up hating him for the rest of your life.|`|C4ibOR7Laa	why try for a baby when your in debt????<br>  <br>  well its to late now i guess, you love this baby? you keep this baby, trust me you will survive, it will be hard but everyting will be fine|`|3URupc7caa	What i dont get it why you planned the baby when you was already in 20,000 grand of debt and even though it was planned your now having second thoughts :S|`|f762b1b79baf609a926675240c6b2e95aa	An abortion would be the wrong thing to do, it has to be a decision you both make, in this instance you will end up hating him for it if you don't follow your heart and go through with it.  <br>  <br>  I'm not anti-abortion at all, but I think it's irresponsible for you to be trying to get pregnant and then changing your mind, you haven't got into debt over the past couple of months, why didn't you sort through your finances beforehand?<br>  <br>  A baby does cost a lot and life is never the same after you have children, but you will get by.|`|Co9I2OMSaa	If you want the baby keep the baby, don't just abort it for financial reasons- there are services that can help single mothers.  And abortion is no way to go anyway, even if you conclude that you can't keep the baby the best thing to do is put it up for adoption because taking a life is no way to handle anything.|`|fac19b1dbb2ff2df17b3984f0bd6c4b3aa	You can get help from the state,lots of benefits are available for single mothers these days so don't make any hasty decisions.Talk to a councillor or the DWP on benefits you would be entitled to as the whole benefit system is very complicated as it is or the CAB if you want non judgemental advice on what you would be entitled to,you don't need a man to make your decisions its your body!...and a life.|`|G9wEDvedaa	it sounds like hes just backing out of his responsibilities. If i were you i would have the baby and try to find a cheap crib, clothes, etc. but if you really can't afford to keep it adoption is always an option<br>  <br>  -- also if your in a situaltion like that and your actually trying to provide for your family the government usually gives you some type of support you should look into all your options first|`|Vi8RDbhUaa	Keep the Baby.  You will figure out a way to survive. Trust Me.  It will be tough at first but once you settle down, get educated in a certain field like nursing or medical tech and get a good job.  You can do this.|`|CB85sH5Uaa	Dude, you were trying for it?  I don't think abortion is an option in this case.  Tell your boyfriend to suck it up.  You got what you wanted.|`|ixD2RnqTaa	Just to let you know, you want this baby.. KEEP IT. Go google images of aborted fetuses and think about what it will do to you baby!<br>  Sounds like your boyfriend is a coward!|`|79eRDIbXaa	It may be a struggle but its possible isn't it.<br>  Why didn't you think about money issues before you PLANNED this Baby?<br>  I mean Money will be tight for us, but this baby wasn't plan and we are going to give her everything we possibly can. <br>  But you PLAN it and decide its maybe not a good idea.
sYsfI856aa	Is he active as he normally has been?<br>  <br>  Everyone won't know to tell you, as you are the one who knows how your baby moves and when he is active.<br>  <br>  If his movement is less than normal, do the kick counts. I think it's if you feel 10 movements in an hour then you are fine, less than that baby could be in distress. Make sure you are resting during the kick counts, lay out on your left side, drink some water and get ready for an hour of counting. <br>  <br>  He's most likely just running out of room and getting into position for his birth day.  <br>  <br>  Less than 10 kicks in the hour, go in to labor and delivery. 10 or more, you should be just fine!|`|2JQdGtHuaa	The farther along you go the less active they are because there's just not enough room. Mine was like that at the end. Nothing to worry about.|`|KMtd5gr0aa	my first was like that. my doc would joke and say he was just lazy lol|`|tivpa7Vlaa	first off at 39wks baby tends to be less and less active. y? no room to move. my sister baby didn't move much either besides at the ending he just liked to sleep a lot.
vygYFdsSaa	I think you should have gotten it on the 1st.|`|o0skhlvAaa	If you are regular it should have come on the 2nd of March... or maybe today. <br>  <br>  If it doesn't come by Friday, I would take an early detection pregnancy test. You can buy one at your local drug store.
EyKJ737daa	It's a lovely thought, what does the MIL think? I know we did the same for my husband's grandmother (his mum's mum) as her middle name was Valentine (Eileen Valentine).  She passed away 1 week to the day unexpectedly before our 3rd daughter was born.  My husband decided to change the Valentine and make it more feminine so we named our youngest Juliette Valentina.  His mother hated it!  I guess we should have stuck to Juliette Victoria hey?! But it might be worth asking her. I guess I'm not keen on Felix only because I had a cat as a kid called Felix, yep he was black with white paws.  I don't know of any other male versions of Felicia though, sorry  ??? But ultimately sweetie, it's your choice.  All the best and good luck for the safe arrival of your new bub.|`|2716717868fe21f32f85869cd02f81d8aa	No, I don't like it|`|XjtZAFOyaa	no|`|OI3bf4yjaa	My cat's name is Felix....|`|S3vYMNzFaa	I think it's perfect.  I love that it will honor your MIL through her grandson!  That seals the deal for me. <br>  <br>  But, besides all that, I also really like the name Felix.  I think it's cool.  It has that 'x' in there, which keeps it interesting, and his meaning is lovely too.  <br>  <br>  Felix Ungar and Felix the Cat are the only things that may hold it back, but I don't have a problem with either of those two.  Also, it was the name of five popes and forty-something Saints!  <br>  <br>  It's lovely - go for it!|`|EWFtQNSdaa	I like it, and it means "happiness" which is an added bonus. And its not like there are going to be 10 other Felix's in the kindergarten class.<br>  There's also Felicity if its a girl!<br>  <br>  :)|`|eZfu69Wnaa	congratulations!<br>  felix reminds me of a cat.<br>  im sorry,|`|xxvLfLrYaa	sorry but no ...it is a nice thought though..|`|F7knBX1haa	NO do not like it SORRY|`|atrObg5saa	i love that name, its not very common. i think that's a great choice.|`|wGCCMjVsaa	sounds like a pets name|`|Ec2uIBjxaa	its a very wierdo name its its quit retarded no affence<br>  i dont like it!|`|ZXVWi4m1aa	well... honestly i don't like that name. lol. the only reason i dont like it is because it seems like a pet name to me. but i bet after a while i would like it anyways if i knew the baby. things tend to grow on people. so, eventually i wouldn't think of it as a pet name. but i dont get how it would be a nice gesture for your mother and law. because they both start with f? but also on the bright side of the name it is very unique and different which i think is cool. something i really find to be important in choosing a name is other kids who may tease them.|`|b99kfMPcaa	Felix seems like a name that would grow with your baby.  It's a boy right?  I wouldn't name a girl Felix.  But it seems like it would be a cute baby name and later a great man name.  That's great that you thought of your mother in law!  I think it's totally sweet and very appropriate!!  I wish I got along with my mother in law!  haha|`|jL7bSneuaa	That is a very nice name(:<br>  Any name is nice but it's great that your mother in law's name is Felicia since they're so similar.<br>  I like it(:|`|gmdsDmnRaa	no, he will be teased as felix the cat. <br>  for the love of god, NO!|`|nLGE0pKcaa	sorry but to be honest i dont like it. it sounds like a ptes name. it reminds me of felix the cat..|`|bpcXdHjJaa	Uhm. No thanks.|`|hIoxij6eaa	Why not use it as his middle name?|`|51cd856f9c2a18d1e26ffbefc3cea6d8aa	no...

Ybo6HS8Caa	How old is your son?  Obviously old enough to somewhat understand the concept of dating and "wanting a mother".  In a way, I see this as a good thing.  I'm not saying you should have a woman-parade through your house or anything, but having a few dates won't hurt.  Besides, any woman whom you would consider seriously dating would need to get along with your son, and it may be to your benefit to let them get to know each other just as slowly and surely and you get to know her.  Do some "group" outings, and see how that goes.  Take your son along once in a while.  Kids are usually VERY good judges of character.  Just be careful, and have fun!|`|T864ejaiaa	he doesn't want you alone and he wants a mom. i feel for the child. be thankful he wants you with someone. whom ever you get with make sure they treat him right. and if they don't just look me up and i'll help you beat the heck out of her. a child is precious and Innocent. god bless your boy. i have 4 girls and i would hurt anyone over them.|`|Hx0a0Q8Uaa	I never involved my son in my dating life, however one time my son met someone I was dating (it was by accident my kid's dad took him to the same restaurant) my son met him asked what I was doing I explained that we were on a date, "blah blah blah" he was only 3 and told me "I like him, he has a Godzilla shirt, skip the date and get married." I took his advice we got engaged about 2 weeks later and now we are happily married! it's been 2-1/2 years and wonderful!|`|023ccdc2611ee634032321712b19450baa	My daughter is 11, and last week she looked at me and said,"mommy, you need a husband!" Oh, dear. <br>  I dated a lot when she was younger but she hated it, and really wanted all my attention for herself. I'm trying to get back out there (not because I think I need a husband) and I think she has mixed feelings about it. Its hard to date as a single parent, hard to find that balance. I think it depends on how old your son is and how much he can really understand. If he is too young to understand that you cant just marry the first girl you meet, a more limited discussion, like, "I haven't met anyone special yet" or "I'll date when I'm ready"  or even asking him how he would feel if you were to go out every friday and he would need to stay with a babysitter-would he be okay with that even if hes going to have to share you. he may not yet understand that. I honestly haven't quite figured it all out yet, but if he's old enough to understand I say just be honest. can't hurt. good luck!|`|9CK62mixaa	That is so cute! <br>  Both of my children would prefer if I DIDN'T date at all. They are so overprotective of me and they want 100% attention. However, I have dated in the past but I usually end it because of work, school, and the boys. I've decided I'll date when I am a lot older or when they do!<br>  <br>  By the way, excellent question!|`|r7q8LW7Aaa	Not quite the same, but I encourage my dad to date! Granted, I'm in my 20s now, but I have young teenage sisters who try to encourage him too. Since my mum left, he's been lonely - it'd be nice to see him happy again.
ibeYAlwpaa	42. I cant imagine why anyone would think it’s a good idea to leave a 10 year old with a 4 year, let alone for a couple of hours. What exactly was your ex doing that he couldn’t take both his kids with him? && do you really want your kid staying with someone with such a lack of common sense. I would snap if this were my child. I think you should defly tell him this behavior is unacceptable and dangerous for both kids!! I also wouldn’t leave my 10 year old home alone either.  ** I know the law for where I am a child cannot even be left alone before the age of 12, which my mom discovered when her ex took her to court bc my lil brothers were home alone at age 11 for an hour after school**|`|fdnbXfvfaa	The kids in our neighborhood, always offer to babysit my daughter, but there is no chance I am leaving 10/11 year olds to look after a 5 year old|`|gJlxZdL5aa	Kids shouldn't be watching kids period.   honestly at age 15 I shouldn't have been watching my 5 year old sister.....<br>  <br>  Kids can be very neglectful of other kids and the younger kids normally has to fend for themself<br>  <br>  At age 20 I did watch my 7 year old sister all summer (she is 9 now) and my other sister was there too (she is now 14) and its a lot of work to watch a kid and make sure the kid stays out of trouble and I was much more responsible then than I ever was as a teen watching a sibling|`|chfILbonaa	Well depending on the maturity level it is on the line it could be either doe the 10 year old know how to take care of young children are they mature enough to take care of themselves at that age it depends on the kid my brother is 13 and he isnt mature enough to stay home by him self let alone watch a kid but I am 14 and i can stay home alone and with kids and have no problem|`|8SjoUQmEaa	Definitely unsafe and illegal.You're not being overprotective of your daughter, you're definitely right in this situation, and quite honestly the world needs more moms like you.|`|AA11206135	Unsafe and ILLEGAL!!!!!|`|Hx0a0Q8Uaa	YES don't do this, actually here in California as long as the child knows how to contact police, there is another adult 3mins away (like next door) and the child can read and write in English this child can stay at home with a sibling for up to 3 hours regardless of age. This is a bullshit law because i've seen 7 year olds babysitting newborns yet when I call CPS they do NOTHING. it's sick and people wonder why their kids act up, or die in easily preventable accidents. No child under the age of 16 should babysit, not ever.|`|5ef99Fneaa	I'd be upset that he left them alone, but I would also say it was okay, just make sure a neighbor in the apartment o even you atleast knows about it so the kids can be checked in on every once in a while (even if its by phone its better then leaving them alone)<br>  <br>  HOPE THIS HELPS IF YOUR TEN YEAR OLD DOESNT KNOW ABOUT 911, TALK TO HIM ABOUT IT!!!!!!!!|`|Lqy9Lc9Oaa	My 10 year old daughter is very mature and smart for her age, but not sure about that one.  My son is also mature for 7.  But 4 is a little more difficult.  I have not left mine alone, but may feel comfortable leaving them for very short periods.  Not even sure what the law is as it is not really clear here in Canada.<br>  <br>  This does not answer your question, but shows I am not even sure either.|`|71e15ac317ae5351e487d5c38939daabaa	I personally would not leave a ten year old in charge for more than 5 minutes. <br>  That said, alot of older teens and adults might not know what to do if someone choked or burned themselves.|`|UajHxo3Daa	I took a babysitting class when I was 11 and got certified to be a babysitter. They taught us everything we needed to now from cpr, to changing diapers ect.|`|QE0U6iPKaa	I don't feel there are any circumstances when you would leave a 10yr old with a 4 yrs old. It is very irresponsible of your ex to do this..I would be very upset if I was you..|`|weBOR9YCaa	I think that 10yr olds should not be babysittng. They may be mature for their age, but nonetheless they are still kids.|`|5TN6AcDBaa	I don't have any kids, because I'm only 17, but my parents have always let me stay home alone, since I was about 10, maybe a little younger. We lived in apartments, and knew everyone around us, so if something happened, I would know what to do. My parents always said I was mature for my age, so they trusted me. I don't think it's a problem to leave the 10 and 4 year old's home alone, just make sure the 10 year old knows what to do in case of emergency, and has certain phone numbers memorized. As for the daughter, you might be a little bit overprotective. My parents let me go and play with friends, without adults present, but it was always somewhere close by. Just make sure you children know what to do when something happens, and I don't think you'll have a problem with them.
hKJIDdVqaa	a bad child who has been in trouble with the law.|`|uP08b6K4aa	1. a minor who cannot be controlled by parental authority and commits antisocial or criminal acts, as vandalism or violence. <br>  2. a child or youth characterized by juvenile delinquency. <br>  <br>  Hope that helps x|`|aCUHzMrmaa	Me 10-15 years ago lol.

AA10196172	The textbook answer - ovulation happens 14 days before your period is due to start. Sperm can live 2 to 3 days waiting; the egg usually gives up within a day.<br>  <br>  So if you have normal 28-day periods, the recommended practice is sex every 2 days so he can recharge his supply. Do it on days 10, 12, 14 and 16. It doesn't hurt to add in day 15. If they are not 28, move the numbers around so that "day 15" is instead 14 days before the next period is due to start.  Any other time also helps the chances.<br>  <br>  If your periods are irregular or less than 25 days (or longer than 32) then who knows when you ovulate. Sex early and often - every other day - is good. <br>  <br>  Also - ovulation timing can sometimes be off. It's a random thing, and depends on the person; it can be off time, just like sometimes you can skip your periods or they're late, for no particular reason - except you don't usually tell when you ovulate.<br>  <br>  There are other ways - tracking body temperature to tell when ovulation happens - or watching your CM (Cervical mucus). When your internal goop is the consistency of egg while, it means the egg is coming soon (IIRC it happens when that CM stops) so you better hop to it!<br>  <br>  Basically, the more you do it, the more likely you'll get pregnant.
hWc65sEtaa	She wouldn't know after just 3 days.  If she is, then you may need a DNA test after the baby is born.|`|mjz8JF9Gaa	she is so lying to u dude <br>  you cant find out your pregnant by hpt until at least 406 weeks after intercourse <br>  and 2 weeks by blood test|`|Drg3bLjUaa	so you are saying shes thinks she is 3 weeks pregnant? she may be feeling nauseous now but I would say she would not have been after 3 days...she might have already been pregnant when you slept with her...I guess the only way for you to find out if she really is pregnant is by insisiting you watch her do a pregnancy test in front of you...if she is pregnant you may have to request a DNA test when the baby is born...all this could have been avoided if you had used protection!!!! Best of luck to you and I hope everything works out the way you want it too.|`|qJaKF24naa	well unless you had sex with her a couple weeks or around a couple weeks before she took the test no way that baby is your if she is really pregnant.|`|ejQ3yg9Naa	She's only pregnant if she was pregnant before you two had sex. It's way too early for her to get a postive or have a belly.|`|jgtfWjE4aa	she's lying!|`|h9mD3jMaaa	I don't think it's possible for the hormones to appear THAT early. Some people don't test positive for over 8 weeks... Feeling sick doesn't necessarily mean pregnant. It could also be psychosematic (meaning she's bringing it on herself) or she's lying completely about it. She wants attention, and she's probably going to take you for a ride if she can, by the sounds of it. <br>  <br>  If it turns out she is pregnant, get a paternity test, especially if she's seeing another guy so soon after.|`|n86nMfbtaa	She's lying.<br>  <br>  You cannot tell until at LEAST three weeks after having sex. And she wouldn't need to wear maternity clothes or jackets until at least about two, three, or even four months! Pretty much all pregnant women can still wear normal clothes until the third month, and any bulging belly before then is just bloating, not baby. She's definately lying to you.|`|AZSIoSNoaa	I doubt its yours, couldn't get a positive test that soon. she could be pregnant though, if she had sex with someone else other than you even a week before, she MAYBE would have got a positive that soon, but not 6 days after the fact. I could be wrong though, consult a doctor and speak with them. Also, she wouldn't be showing!!! That's pretty much a guarantee! Good Luck, and God Bless|`|fUK9y3Qkaa	There's no way you can find out your pregnant 6 days after having sex. That's not possible. Sounds like she's lying to me. What you do is go with her to one of her appointments and ask the doctor or nurse when she's due and what's the date of conception. And for the person that said it takes 406 weeks to find out on a hpt...thats clearly incorrect....smh!!!|`|5h8bYsKdaa	hmm did you see the positive test? if it was positive after 6 days, chances are , its not yours. plus, there'd be no point of wearing a "pregnant shirt" when you are like 5 or 6 weeks along.<br>  <br>  sounds very strange. ask her to show a proof of pregnancy and then find out when she concieved. doesnt sound right at all|`|ITzjhb0Laa	she could be pregnant but it couldn't be yours. pregnancy tests can't detect it 6 days after and she wouldn't be sick already.|`|0K3tPNuxaa	sorry but she's lying. Most likely not your baby. I feel bad because I cant stand women that lie about that :( so sorry
A9cH8CL9aa	probably not...
SRzswqTeaa	10-20 minutes in a hot tub is generally safe if you are past the first trimester.  Especially if the hot tub is at a 101 degree temp. However, MOST hot tubs hold their temps at 104 degrees F.   If you don't have a way to control the temp, you might just plan on 10-15 minutes in the tub. If you feel hot, get out.. especially if you get dizzy.  Thats a good sign you are too overheated, which isn't the best for baby.<br>  <br>  Here is a good article on what to do and look out for if you go ahead and get in.  (I went into our hot tub several times during pregnancy, but we set it a bit lower and I didn't stay in very long at each time)..<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.americanpregnancy.org/pregnancyhealth/hottubs.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.americanpregnancy.org/pregnan...</a>|`|PPNlNc92aa	You should definately not get into the hot tub until after the baby arrives.  Try having just a warm bath but remember the water should not be too hot as it can make the baby restless.|`|0MUvGlHkaa	im feeling your pain i am the same as my baby is so low down in my pelvis and im no where near due yet. I have an outdoor spa and asked my doctor if I was allowed to get in for pain relief he said hot tubs are fine for 10 minutes only its not good to go over your body's temperture and he also said before that stage comes i would want to get out anyway so go relax you will be fine.|`|wphI41wNaa	Wait until you have the baby and stop bleeding it's not safe to go into hot tubs while pregnant. You can try hot pads rubbing it or a warm, not hot, bath.
8wW21fnGaa	eat very healthy lotsa fruits & veggies lotsa spinacha and grapefruit.   Absolutely no candy sweets, soda, caffine, no preservitives  and especially no fast food AT ALL, not any processed foods.  <br> eat organic and fresh fresh foods, lotsa salads.  Eat what's in season and you will be fine also.  EXCERSISE be consistantly hatdcore walking and swimming.|`|dGsUEIZdaa	After you turn off the caps lock on your computer keyboard, go see the doctor.|`|hIoxij6eaa	Yuck! Poor thing its horrible hey? Definately not psychological - all the positive thinking in the world doesn't get your head out of the toilet bowl! Maybe the doctor will be able to give you something? Maxolon (although that made me really giddy and gave me a migraine) or a travel sickness tablet maybe? There is then only really the usual things, ginger, dry crackers, eating before you get out of bed. Someone once told me that eating half an apple before getting out of bed and then eating the other half once you were up helps but it did nothing for me. Nothing worked for me. I was just lucky that I was only sick for the first 14 weeks with my second one. Hopefully yours won't last too long this time.<br>  Other than that, make sure you keep hydrated, you may need some electrolytes.<br>  Hope you are feeling better soon and all the best with your pregnancy. Congratulations|`|thXFB45Waa	Well my cousins was like you but it went away. They had given her a low dose pills for nausea, you can also just eat saltine crackers o help a little or minty things like gum etc..
XB9VDLGSaa	i think you are better off sleeping than trying to wake up and sleep.<br>  <br>  also, sometimes the best time to read is right before you sleep.
fvtVXYA2aa	Drink lots of water, have someone slightly tap your back to loosen it up and then.....COUGH!COUGH!COUGH!|`|OBU1eDUHaa	Water will help thin it out.  I was always told that milk products make it thicker, but I've seen recently that that's not true.  I also understand that prego women get a lot of congestion, stuffiness while pregnant.  Call your MD and see what options you have available.  I had the same problem, but suffered from allergies all my life.  I was already taking Zyrtec (an allergy relieve pill like Benadryl) before I got prego and my MD said it was ok for me to continue it during the pregnancy.  Good luck!|`|oeRBdfjuaa	drink lots of water..also go in the bathroom,turn the shower on high,HOT water,and just let it run and get steamy in there..and just breath..help loosen..also get a humidifier!!|`|jvFWNuiXaa	You could use saline water in a neti pot to clean it out.
d91775dc0167078dadf8d8093e2a4445aa	it could be late for a couple of reasons...a re you stressted out?  have you lost a lot of weight?  and the last actually could be because you may be preggo.c|`|MXVrsn1Oaa	If you're 2 weeks a late a home pregnancy test will work now :)|`|gMOWe2Xfaa	Yes that is so true hon..It happen to me and I thought i was indeed pregnant because of the brown discharge but when I tested that third week I wasn't pregnant. I guess I was under a lot of stress and it caused me to be late. You can sometimes go a whole month without a period and not be pregnant. I hope this was enough information and good luck!|`|f7c5471c72f7f084411ee3f3f3e4b818aa	Well, my period was ten days late last week and I was worried sick...then it came. It's never been late like that before. I guess I was justa  little bit overstressed for stress can delay it a bit. So, maybe thats why you have to wait, because your period is influenced by a number of things...after three weeks have passed though and there's no sign of it, you can almost be sure that you're pregnant.
HeBFxZVCaa	its when the baby starts bobbing in and out of the pelvis.<br>  <br>  Different midwives describe and write the degree of engagement in one of two ways. When they palpate (feel) the woman's belly, they feel on either side of the baby's head to see how much of it they can still feel above the pubic bone (the bone at the front of the pelvis, under the pubic hair). Some midwives say the baby is 3/5 when they can feel 3/5 still out of the pelvis, while some say the baby is 3/5 when they feel that that much of the baby's head is in the pelvis. Either way, about half of your baby's head was in your pelvis at the time of the examination. First babies tend to stay down once they have moved into an engaged position in the pelvis. Engagement means that the widest part of the baby's head has entered the pelvis. They can be said to be engaged when 2/5 or less of their head is palpable above the pelvis. Subsequent babies may bob in and out of the pelvis, and often don't engage deeply until the contractions of labour push the baby down into the pelvis. It may be that your baby is at this bobbing in and out stage. You might feel that it is lower on some days than on others. <br>  hope it made sense. .Good luck though hun and hopefully you dont have long to go x|`|ycdkngxlaa	I think she meant that the baby is bobbing up and down inside you and not completely engaging in your pelvic area.
FsFUo4VJaa	I think that is a great Idea. You should.|`|bHI4NLonaa	there is absolutely no reason. do it.|`|YrHwZw6zaa	It's your kind and you could name it however you want!!!|`|iAfmejYTaa	huh??|`|AA12373941	You're allowed to have kids?  What the hell is a Taqueria?  Oh I googled it and it's a Mexican Restaurant.  Sod it - I like Mexican food.

I hope it's twins and you can name one after your favourite milkshake too|`|TRvAhhNKaa	Only do it if you get free tacos from that place for life because of the free advertising they get. But for even considering naming a child that you should be sterilized.
AA10478980	When my kids were growing up I got very little time away from them other than when I was working.  I understand totally what you mean about just wanting a little time to yourself and some privacy for some things.  I remember once being in the bathroom with the door closed - I was actually sneaking a couple of minutes to read a page in a book - and my kids were outside the door trying to look under it (there was a gap of about 2 inches under the door) and I could see their fingers wiggling under the door and they were saying something like "Mom!  Are you in there?  Mom?"  Do you have any friends in the area who can watch your kids for an hour now and then so that you can get away?  Or your husband's family?  Or your family?  Or how about your husband?  Have him stay home with the kids on one of those evenings when he goes out and you go out instead.  My daughter and son-in-law each go out one or two evenings a week, separately, because they can't afford babysitters either.  In October I visited them and took care of the kids for a week so they could go on a little trip.  You do need time alone, and pay no attention to those who criticize that need.  Find a way to get someone responsible to take care of them occasionally so that you can get a little time for yourself.  You will be a much better mom to them as a result.|`|ENANtueuaa	It sounds like you're more upset that your husband has the freedom to do as he pleases, while you feel you don't, and you feel like you have no "me" time. Are you a stay at home mom? I would try talking to your husband about being home more, because it seems like you have more of the responsibilties with the kids, and maybe you just want a little more help from him...just a guess. Having no family to watch your kids can be hard, but what about friends? Everyone needs a chance to "breathe" every now and then, and i understand that sometimes you just want to go take a walk...alone. I only had 1 child at this age (and was a single mom at the time), and it can be stressful at times, but i worked during the day. So, when i wasn't working, my daughter was always with me. My family had to actually beg me to let them watch her lol, we are just that close. I can understand that it is different with more than 1 child though, and unlike me, you aren't even given the option of being able to go out if you wanted to. Best thing to do is explain this to your husband, you two are in this together. Good luck :)|`|p3cW2iKpaa	I know what you mean. I have a one stepchild and another who only comes on the weekends.  I love it when my wife and I get rid of them every now and then.

LOL ... we are humans not monks to sacrifice all our tastes wishes and likes after kids are born .. <br>  <br>  I am with u .. dont go with people who answer ur question for 2 points .. <br>  <br>   Enjoy and when u have such a good time, at the end do remember there are kids waiting for u .. <br>  <br>  Take them to their fav place like chuck-e-cheese .. hop lops etc .. just to make them feel they didnt miss u completely ..|`|ibeYAlwpaa	why is your husband going out like 5-6 times a week?? Do you mean like at night? That seems a little much. Why dont you just have his @ss stay with them everyonce in awhile? Nothing infuriates me more then when guys can to do things but their wives or babys moms cant. It seems like you and your husband need to sit down and talk about this. <br>  && BTW there is NOTHING wrong with wanting to get away for a bit.. and there is NOTHING wrong if you do want to go out and party every once in awhile (im not talking lets go crazy every weekend, but once a month or once every few months is COMPLETELY reasonable)|`|ovzUvTifaa	I hear you. We live in a new area and I don't have friends and we don't have a lot of money for a sitter either. I needed a Pap last week and lucked out (at the last minute) that my husband could take off - otherwise I would've had to figure out how to lay on a table and keep my 13 month old (who can't obey yet) in line. <br>  <br>  We end up going out very infrequently and our son sleeps from 9pm-7am so we only get about an hour of time 'alone' and that is usually spent with our feet up exhausted or cleaning up the house before bed.<br>  <br>  Going to the bathroom is a joke and dealing with tantrums, teething and other circumstances 14 hours a day, 7 days a week is enough to make anyone insane. All you want (and NEED) sometimes is a 5 or 10 minute break to stand or walk outside by yourself to just 'recharge' so you feel like a human again - and you can't get it. There's a REASON it's the law to allow 15 minute breaks and lunches for all employees. There are times when my son and I are having 'tough' days and I put him in his room (with a gate at his door - the room is very childproof) and go onto the porch to just breathe for a second - but it's worthless because the entire time I can hear him yelling "mom-mom-mom-mom-mom" from his room and having a tantrum because I am not with him every minute.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, you have moments within each day that make you realize that you are lucky to be able to be a mom - especially being able to stay at home with them. Even through the difficult times, I wouldn't trade this life for the life that I had before him. Not ever. And I had a pretty carefree, mentally stimulating life. :)<br>  <br>  My only suggestion is to ask your husband to trade one of the nights he goes out each week to either: watch the kids while you go out for an hour OR stay in and take turns with you for the evening so you both get time to read/do what you want - without being on constant 'baby duty'. <br>  <br>  Personally, my husband is not a fan of diapers and doesn't like watching our son alone (yet). He truly has a weak stomach so I cut him slack. But he does stay in most nights, he is working if he is out (overtime EVERY week), and when he's home he'll let me catch a nap or read a book for a bit and helps me with our son (plays with him, gives him food, keeps him from climbing on everything). He used to be very stressed about becoming the 'sole breadwinner' and felt like he needed to rest when he got home because he was mentally and physically exhausted. <br>  <br>  One day I was tired and could barely function so I set the kitchen timer for 20 minutes, walked into the bedroom without a word and climbed into bed. I left my son with my husband. I heard my husband come in the room a few minutes later, ignored him, woke up when the timer went off and came back out to greet them. My husband never once complained about that. He figured that I wouldn't have went in there and fell asleep if I wasn't really tired. Ever since then I've been a lot braver about getting 'me' time. I'm comfortable at this point to just walking away for 15-30 minutes and my husband being alright with that. Those days are still few between because of how much he works but it has helped greatly.<br>  <br>  Sorry for the book. Thought it may help. :P
SNLFVblhaa	i say get a cake that you think will entertain the guests. and you will obviously take pictures and the baby will see it when he gets older. get him a little cake preferably one that matches the bigger cake and let the little one eat it with his hands.  <br>  <br>  but as for the photobucket pictures.<br>  i say either the cow or the farm, because the chickens just look like more of thanksgiving, and it is going to be in summer.<br>  <br>  hope i helped!|`|AA11916244	Go to walmart you get a small birthday cake for kids first birthday for free. Its just a plain little cake then you could get another or make another for the adults.We did that for my daughters first and let her tear into it. She had it everywhere.|`|FvLg5HtWaa	The cow is Adorable!  My opinion is: Which is cheaper.?|`|d666c2be64ceba00657540ace50128e4aa	Our daughter's 1st birthday theme was Little Mermaid because we had her party at a park by the beach and that was how I wanted it to be (and we had this adorable Little Mermaid outfit for her to wear just for the party LOL).  So we ordered a Little Mermaid cake from Publix Bakery and then they gave us a cute little smash cake just for her (for free).  She didn't care what it looked like...just that it tasted so yummy and she didn't want us to take it away LOL.  <br>  <br>  <br>  It's really up to you, if you would rather make the cake or buy it.  Of the cakes you showed in that album I liked the Cow and the Barn better than the Chicken ones.  If I knew I could make a cake like the Cow or Barn...then I would probably do it just because I could, ya know?  But for those of us who are artistically and baking challenged...LOL it's easier to go for store-bought and use the time and energy on other details for the party.|`|zKho7H3Faa	i ,with both of my children, purchased the cakes,  i gave a small one for them to play in and then a large on for all the guest, babies are cute and all but to eat after one has played in the food is not what everyone would think of as " a good piece of cake: but the joy on that babies face is priceless, but its up to you because buying can be costly but convenient and making one is the same but wont cost as much and is a little time consuming. hope this helps.|`|pXSKSS3daa	The barn cake is cute. Well, they all are but that would really tie in with your theme if that's what you're going with.<br>  <br>  We're having the cake made for Noah's party because for 1) we live 3 hours away from where we are holding it at and 2) I'm already making sugar cookies for favors so I really don't have time to make something.<br>  <br>  It's really your call. Phone some bakeries and get prices on their cakes. Maybe that will help in making your decision.|`|bYhqPOtwaa	I really like the barn and the cow.<br>  <br>  I made a race car cake for my son's 1st birthday, and a tractor cake for his 2nd. I enjoy making and decorating cakes but I don't get to do it that often as it's very time-consuming. I think it's something special and memorable to do for your child - any more most have store bought cakes. I plan on letting him pick what type of cake he wants and I'll make it every year.<br>  <br>  And all the party guests rave about homemade cakes! They're so cute and taste so much better than store bought.|`|2274dcf5eba0ee2ef3aabbe2c8b0a89daa	my mom every year made my cake from scratch, no matter how many people were there. and for me i will do the same for my little one.<br>  so its really your call! if you can bake i would make it my self, but if you would rather save the time then go ahead and buy it.|`|CtVLaAZRaa	I made my son's first birthday cake at home myself. It was so much fun compared to buying one made from the store. Use a cheap yellow cake mix and chocolate icing. It doesn't have to be made homemade it can be all from a box. The baby doesn't care. I would use green colored coconut for the grass, jelly beans for eggs and then you can use little plastic farm animals that are a good size so baby can play with them later. My son loved to lick the icing off of his dinosaurs I used. As for the adults the cake does not need to be a themed cake. If you like to bake I would make a 9x13 sheet cake at home and ice it myself if not just buy a sheet cake at the store that says Happy Birthday with his name on it. It will save you tons of money. The baby won't remember what you did anyways on the first birthday. You have tons of birthdays ahead that you will be spending more money on.|`|IuJjYz6gaa	I've bought cakes every year for my kids because I am NOT talented enough to decorate my own.  We usually buy from a bakery, either a local grocery store bakery or an actual bakery.  Last year, I bought their cakes from a local catering service.  I always have them decorate it the way I want.  <br>  <br>  You could ask a bakery if they could do the farm cake.<br>  <br>  For their first birthdays my daughter had one of those small round cakes, and my son had a couple of cupcakes.|`|ccd9bacbf1ad616406e98ebf61adc6dcaa	I actually work in a bakery, so it was easier for me to have it done there. The decorator made it look like a princess castle, and also did a "baby cake" to match. If you're in a time crunch, you could take in one of those pictures and see if the decorator can do something comparable. I like the cow best myself, but if you choose one of the hens, maybe do a small chick for the baby to smash and eat. The farm theme is very adorable, btw.

8fB5oh9jaa	I know that this might be stressful in the sense that you are nervous, but chances are highly leaning towards you not being pregnant. As long as you guys didn't allow the penetration to continue you will be fine and it's probably your period starting. <br>  <br>  There is an off-chance, however, that it could happen, though this is VERY unlikely. When a guy becomes erect, there is a natural secretion of a fluid that may sometimes contain semen,but this fluid is a result of the body ridding the penis off waste, i.e. urine, before using it for another reason (sexual reproduction). This is because, unlike in females, males use the same opening for two separate functions (waste and semen).|`|4CMx1uzXaa	If his tip went in a little then yes- there is sperm in pre *** you know- AND IT ONLY TAKES ONE to fertilize an egg, funnily enough...|`|A8k9NHigaa	relax you are not pregnant. but next time make sure to keep a condom in your purse in case yall go all the way.|`|2nfMSDiPaa	I dont think so...|`|i0Exuxi2aa	Chances are slim to none. Though, if you are experiencing sickness like throwing up, and your period hasn't come, get a test. The crampings may be an indication that your period is coming, but that depends on individuals. If you have cramps before all of your periods, then maybe yes, your period is coming. Don't worry too much, you're probably not pregnant. But next time, please don't fool around...|`|xGV0ooCHaa	If what you described is how it happened... No, your not pregnant so stop stressing yourself out! The likeliness of you becoming pregnant are so little they barely exist.  <br>  <br>  Although it is good that you are worried, because IF the time comes, you will know to take the proper precautions and wear a condom.<br>  <br>  Best wishes!|`|S583sSc5aa	the trick is to take the boxers off ? boxers are not a form of contraception much to popular belief i recommend using a condom and no boxers?|`|H5wyRZTNaa	it is unlikely, but it is possible. but don't freak out...just be more careful.|`|8z1VEeM2aa	Uhh.<br>  <br>  No.<br>  <br>  You can't get pregnent without sex.|`|kiaiXcjsaa	.your not pregnant|`|d222d3f47043def4bb4ae3e895ef58c1aa	no u are not pregnant ... how young are u anyways?|`|KvbiUAUhaa	dw bout it :)|`|V4BY8qYOaa	There is a possibility.

iMY2fgYdaa	I had PCOS myself after getting of depo. I didn't get my perion at all for over 2 years. Your doc will want to know if you want to get pregnant first of all. then they will decide if you do they will ask if you want to keep trying on your own or go on medication to help you ovulate. If you don't they will put on the pill to help regulate your periods.  as far as if your ovulating or not thats hard to tell. But if it helps any...I was on the pill for a year to get my periods regulated..then got off so we could get pregnant...I had one period in jan of 07 then nothing and then got preg the end of march. So there is always a chance. Hope this helped you a bit....oh also eating a healthy diat full of vegs and fruits and lean protien along with exercise can help with the PCOS. I changed those things and was exercising when I got pregnant. Losing a little bit of weight seems to help the hormone imbalance.<br>  Good luck!

oj1TszL2aa	First thing's first, are you like this in your other classes, or just biology? It sounds as though it's the latter, which either makes me think that you should be assessed for learning difficulties (although if you behave like this normally, I'm surprised that you haven't been already), or you know that your behaviour is unacceptable and are merely making excuses for yourself. <br>  <br>  Think about this from your teacher's point of view. If you will not work and are disrupting the rest of the class when you are sitting with other people, and you will not work and are disruptive when you are sitting on your own, what do you expect them to do?! You are there to work, not to mess around, and certainly not to prevent other people from working as well. <br>  <br>  If you don't cope will with disappointment, surely you will not cope well if you get bad grades. If you are having difficulty in concentrating, why not try taking notes on what the teacher is saying? Or ask questions if there is something that you don't understand? That should have positive effects on your grades as well. <br>  <br>  I'm not surprised that you don't have much self belief, because you keep labelling yourself! There is nothing wrong with being sensitive and nothing wrong with being a little immature for your age, but there is something wrong when you decide to use those as excuses for not doing what you are meant to do. <br>  <br>  Why not talk to your teacher and see if, together, you can come up with some ways to keep your concentration on the lesson, and stop you from ruining both your own learning and that of other people. At some point soon you will have to manage in the real world, and you will HAVE to cope on your own. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps.<br>  x|`|TZi4ChYYaa	I know what you mean. It sounds really petty and it is when i look back on it, but when I was 13 there was no 3 tables together and my R.E teacher wouldn't let me move one so I got really wound up and almost threw a chair at her LOL . BTW every other teacher lets you move the tables around. I got off very lightly- send to the nurse to calm down, no punishment what so ever- it wasn't even metioned at parents evening! I blame the hormones LOL|`|i0Exuxi2aa	Listen, I was 16 not too long ago so hear me out. You would have to change who you are. Having those arguements are only hurting your teacher, and most importantly, yourself. <br>  Before anything, this is why you should do, have higher empathy. Imagine yourself in his shoes and what would he feel like, and what you would have done if you were in that position. If you are disrupting yourself, he probably wouldn't have cared that much, but you are disrupting the rest of the class, and that's really bad! How does that make you feel, knowing you were trouble to others. <br>  From where I'm standing, I see perfect sense in his actions. I hope you can see it too. I'm sorry, but no matter how smart you are, you have to consider others around you. You have to change your ways. One more thing, I know you don't feel like it, but you should apologize to your teacher. No, don't have to come up crying or anything, and you don't have to write a 10 page report either. Just put an apple on his desk with a card that says sorry and your name on it would be enough, he will understand and that will go a long way in reducing the strain between you two. <br>  I hope I've been a help, and I really hope you can fix things up with your teacher. Best of luck!   : )

vue9NOhYaa	Formula feeding became the norm in the early-mid 20th century, for several, interrelated reasons.<br>  <br>  1. Before that point, artificial feeding was simply not survivable.  There was little understanding of nutrition or cleanlinesss, so a baby 'raised up by hand' usually just died. (They were fed things like gruel, arrow-root, ale and other less desireable foods.)  If a mother couldn't/wouldn't breastfeed, she tried her best to find a wetnurse and only if there was no other option would artificial feeding be attempted.   Around the turn of the last century, developments in hygeine and nutrition made clean, relatively safe formulas an option, and many mothers made the choice to use it. (Or had no choice, and so used it.) <br>  <br>  2. At the same time, schedule feeding became the norm.  These formulas were calculated (at least in theory) to be precisely designed for the needs of each baby, so baby had to eat precise amounts. And, from a practical POV, making formula was time consuming and complex (these formulas were just a mixture of regular milk, sugar and water), and keeping the bottles sterile was difficult. So mom had to know exactly how many bottles baby would need each day, and how many ounces.  At first, schedules for breastfed babies were different, (typically every 2 hours, vs. 4 hours for formula fed) but within a few years the '4 hour schedule' became standard for everyone.  And ... suddenly ... women were finding that they 'couldn't' breastfeed.  Their babies were screaming and gaining weight poorly, and their milk was drying up.<br>  <br>  3.  So ... over the next few decades, more and more women 'failed' at breastfeeding, and doctors began to assume that 'modern women are just too nervous to breastfeed', and recommend formula.  (Strangely, EVERY medical, pregnancy, pediatric and childcare book continued to recommend breastfeeding  -- it was well known that formula fed babies continued to die at much higher rates [this was pre-antibiotics], but actual doctors seemed to just stop recommending it ... because few women were able to succeed. <br>  <br>  4. Fast forward to the 1960's, virtually nobody breastfed, and commercial formulas were heavily marketed, and doctors had been mostly trained in a generation where they had never seen a nursing mother and had NO idea what to do to support a mom who might want to nurse.  (Even then, the 'books' continued to promote breastfeeding, but recognized that most women wouldn't want to .. so they'd say things like "if you want to, and your husband agrees, by all means try. But if it doesn't work, don't feel guilty.'  A huge change from the 1920's baby care books which said things like "Every mother's first duty is to breastfeed her baby!") <br>  <br>  4. Things are starting to shift back, as strict schedules are no longer typical, and we're beginning to 'remember' how nature means for our bodies to function.  But we're still fighting an uphill battle against 'formula is really just as good' and 'breastfeeding isn't for everyone' and a lack of understanding about the risks of formula and benefits of breastfeeding. (With antibiotics, those babies who get sick more often on formula don't often die.)<br>  <br>  (It has little to do with working outside the home.  Back in the 1950's-'60's when most middle class mothers stayed home, virtually NOBODY breastfed)|`|4e67Pdfvaa	probably had something to do with the womens movement.. it tends to affect children and babies. (and i am not against women's rights, just think things go overboard ie abortion etc) <br>  <br>  Go ahead and give me thumbs down, i don't care!  You know you|`|LWXRVO5Haa	Some say that formula is as good, or better, than mother's milk, but such talk is likely to give breastfeeding activists such as myself an aneurism.<br>  Amid all the talk of how superior the boob is to the bottle, it can be easy to forget that practical concerns sometimes make breastfeeding difficult. Not all working mothers can pump, let alone breastfeed, at work. There may also be other complications: lack of milk, nipple pain, need for certain medications. <br>  A growing number of mothers who bottle-feed their babies are raising their voices in an angry chorus, asking why they should be made to feel guilty.<br>  <br>  "It is an argument which deflects attention from the lack of knowledge and understanding of most health professionals about breastfeeding. This allows them not to feel guilty for their ignorance of how to help women overcome difficulties with breastfeeding, which could have been overcome and usually which could have been prevented in the first place if mothers were not so undermined in their attempts to breastfeed.<br>  <br>  If a pregnant woman went to her physician and admitted she smoked a pack of cigarettes, is there not a strong chance that she would leave the office feeling guilty for endangering her developing baby? If she admitted to drinking a couple of beers every so often, is there not a strong chance that she would leave the office feeling guilty?<br>  <br>  Why such indulgence for formula? The reason of course, is that the formula companies have succeeded so brilliantly with their advertising to convince most of the world that formula feeding is just about as good as breastfeeding, and therefore there is no need to make such a big deal about women not breastfeeding."|`|yB5go5wbaa	I agree with the whole mom going back to work thing.  It's an independence thing - you don't have to always be "tied" to your baby.  I breast feed and it's hard because I do have to work my schedule around my son's feeding schedule, which is pretty much all the time now because he's a newborn.<br>  <br>  My grandmother also didn't know breast feeding was "best" when it came to nursing versus formula feeding.  I think when she had her babies, it was considered healthier to formula feed, because it was made and you knew what was in it...does that make sense?  I don't know, I thought her reaction was interesting.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Also, breast feeding is free and being able to buy formula sort of showed that you had money back in the day.|`|GqsLNUE8aa	It's a good question because it is the norm and yet not what's natural and well not the best for the baby. While I believe it was invented to save lives, I agree with the lady who said it became the norm because of working mother's ~~ to an extent. Also I think we're talking about a generation that took the doctor's word as "god".|`|abaad89210d63dec4904f2e85346439caa	actually the "fad" varies from generation to generation.  A couple generations ago, it was considered disgusting by many people to breastfeed and then the next generation, everyone breastfeed, and then its back to formula again.  I actually have noticed an increase towards breastfeeding and a more natural way of doing things.  <br>  I think many people still formula feed because of convenience factors as well as having to work.  Some jobs make it very hard to breastfeed or even just having a job period makes it hard to breastfeed.|`|HSUfe3m7aa	I chose formula feeding because I had issues with my breasts. At 42DD I absolutely did not want them hanging out to feed the baby. They are also extremely sensitive and I could not stomach the thought of a baby feeding off of them. I also had postpartum and was thankful my husband could also feed the baby and I could get a break.<br>  <br>  At no time did I consider formula feeding because of advertising. It's obviously more expensive to choose formula feeding so it does have it's drawbacks. I have seen many women with trouble breastfeeding and sadness they go through. They beat themselves up over not being able to breastfeed and get depressed and think they are hurting their babies. <br>  <br>  Women shouldn't be criticized for whatever choice they make, it's personal, only they can make it and you have to make the choice that is best for mom AND baby.|`|YW74O9aNaa	You already said it ... this became common because many women start going back to works in a couple of months or so and formula is quite handy , convinient and nutritious too. <br>  <br>  Even though many women pump and make sure their babies get breast milk... physical contact with the baby makes a mother produce more milk as opposed to pumping. So eventually pumping doesn't give enough milk for the baby and supplementing it by formula becomes necessary. <br>  <br>  Still i don't think formula feeding is a norm ... nowadays MOST women choose to breastfeed. <br>  And formula is always a second choice for reason like premature infants, or if babies are not strong enough to latch on and suck. Or the mother has health problems which prevent her from breastfeeding.|`|abT0o6hHaa	I agree that it has a lot to do with woman working outside the home. Nursing just doesn't work for everyone, whether its because they want to return to work, are sick, don't make enough, or simply because they are squeamish about having such intimate contact with an infant (my reason) or that they just don't want to. If it doesn't work for you then it doesn't work. There are lots of great formulas now a days that have every nutrient and vitamin a baby needs and even some you cant find in breast milk. To each his own. As long as the baby is happy thats all that matters. As far as the WIC thing goes, why would this woman just assume that you need WIC? Breast feeding your child has nothing to do with your inability to afford formula!|`|fHjSonssaa	I don't know the actual history behind it- but my guess is this:<br>  breastfeeding is the natural process to feed your child.  It's how mammels do it- etc....<br>  then...for whatever reason- for convenience, because some women are unable to breastfeed- the concept of formula was born.  Everyone probably thought it was a dream come true when it came out- it meant someone else besides mom could feed the baby (pumps were probably not around, or a very new concept)- it meant mom could go back to work, it was an answer for women who couldn't breastfeed.<br>  <br>  Now when formula first came out- no one KNEW that the benefits of breastfeeding were SO good for beby- as long as baby was getting fed, I don't think it mattered.<br>  <br>  Both my sister and I were formula fed.  Neither of us would take the breast-- and back then, I still don't think we knew the benefits of breastfeeding as a whole- so if the baby doesn't want to take the breast, why not just formula feed vs. pumping- if they even had pumps back then?<br>  <br>  Personally, I view breastfeeding to be similar to organic veggies.  Formula and breastmilk will both nourish your baby- they will both help your little one grow- and they are both good.  BUT there are *extra* benefits of breastfeeding.  So mom, in most cases, gets to decide what works for her baby, her, etc...<br>  The non-organic veggie will feed your child and nourish them, but the organic veggie is just a little better- in some people's opnions.<br>  <br>  I've never used that analogy before- so bare with me if it doesn't work to your liking.<br>  <br>  I HAVE to formula feed my son because my milk never came in due to complications.  I think my opinion of formula feeding moms has changed a lot- before I was a mother, I thought that formula feeding people were NOT doing the right thing- but I have learned a lot.  There isn't a choice in lots of situations.  And I also think that people view breastfeeding as something VERY easy to do.  I don't think it works for everyone- and there are various reasons.<br>  <br>  My question is, why do people have such a hard time accepting formula.  Are you suggesting I starve my child if there is NO milk available?  (I am not directing the question at the asker of the question- just asking in general).  <br>  <br>  For those people who think breastfeeding is the ONLY way to go- <br>  do you have any suggestions is breastmilk is not available?  I am aware that there are breastmilk banks, however it is EXTREMEMLY expensive, and usually reserved for sick babies who really need it- as there is NOT an unlimited supply.|`|nuBRcuwvaa	1. Society has become fixated on instant gratification and selfishness.  This is across the board (gender, age, etc.)  Women don't want to deal with the hassle.  Women don't want to sacrifice personal time.<br>  <br>  2. Society is completely overly obsessed with "the perfect and sexual body."  There are unwritten rules that women must be a certain size and shape.  Heaven forbid your boobs get a little saggy after breastfeeding.  In addition, breastfeeding takes away time from women working out and spending time on themselves to get back to the perfect body.<br>  <br>  3. Just like with many other things - the world of marketing has successfully promoted a false image of formula feeding.  When formula began to be promoted as "the next best thing" the comercials and advertisements stretched the truth.  Men and women stood in lines to buy this "new technology" item that was just as good!  However, we've learned that this just isn't true... but its hard to go backwards now and re-teach everybody the facts.<br>  <br>  4. With an increase in women working, the ability for some to nurse/pump is just not good.  Not every woman is fortunate to work in a field where they can carry a pump to work... and most of us have to go back to work.  Plus - even if they had the opportunity to work, pumping is almost always deemed as gross or weird.|`|wzXJOSIeaa	I think the main reason is because many mothers HAVE to work now. Some jobs do not allow pumping. As wrong as it may be, it's the way of the world these days.<br>  <br>  I for one, breastfed my son for the first 4 months but then I got sick with a really bad sinuis infection got on antibodics and my milk just stopped flowing. And when I tell you I tired EVERYTHING, from pumping evey hour, to fenegreek, to more milk plus supplement, drinking LOTS and LOTS of water. NOTHING worked. So I'm glad the formula was there. Because otherwise my son would have gone hungry.<br>  <br>  There are SO MANY reasons that formula has become the norm and it would take me FOREVER to sit hear and name them. And anyone who says that breastfeeding is better IS COMPLETELY RIGHT, but some people just can't do it and formula is a great source when a mommy can't.<br>  <br>  Thank you SOOO much for putting this question in a nice way. It's not often that people ask these questions in this manner. And I know we have had our difference over this same issue and I am sorry for that. Hope you can forgive me.|`|FLEXqVoiaa	WTF is up with the first two answers? lol. I think it has a lot to do with entertainment-You never see a new mom breastfeeding on TV or in the movies. It most likely is this way because way-back-when, formula feeding WAS the norm. Breastfeeding was considered trashy and for poor women. Doctors thought formula was just as good as breast milk. The moms who formula fed back in the day thought they were doing what was best for their child. That WIC comment though...the only way to explain that is stupidity lol.|`|AA10236778	Does your child actually suckle or do you just pump and feed? Sorry the question.......Breastfeeding to me is when mom pulls it out where acceptable and feeds direct, not pump and feed as a norm. My opinion in general is it is a very heart warming thing to see. Mother and child bonding that no amount of formula could every achieve.|`|FsFUo4VJaa	Some People just don't even try to breast feed. And it is a pain in the but to breast fed when you have to go back to work at 6 weeks but I did it for 9 months now when I am at work he eats formula then when I am home I breastfeed him.|`|Slw6D95Paa	with forula you have horrid diapers, ewwwww. with breast milk you are strengthening the babies amune system. i think it became the "norm" when people realized that they thought that they had better things to do than breast feed their baby.|`|0zWJlNi1aa	I dont know - but Im glad its around as I wasnt able to breastfeed for medical reasons so Im glad it is available|`|iLLoc003aa	When women had other options other than being stay at home moms and wives...some moms don't have the time to breast feed 20 minutes on each breast every 2-3 hours...|`|08GDBedGaa	i think predominately for the working mum although there are other reasons!|`|9cpwsrJiaa	I personally think that some mothers (medical reasons aside) formula feed even though they could breastfeed because breastfeeding can be uncomfortable and some women find it a hassle. They think that having to sit around and take the time to feed 10-20 min on each breast is just too much wasted time when they could just fix a bottle and let the father or grandparent's handle it while they focus on something else.<br>  <br>  Also, some women find breastfeeding makes the nipples very very sore and so they feed with bottles to keep their comfort level in check. I'm 8 months pregnant with my first child and I plan to breastfeed if at all possible for at least 5-6 months (or until she starts teething) and then pump and bottle feed her with breast milk. I think not only is it cheaper than buying formula, it's better for the baby in the long run.|`|AA12243380	I think it really does have a lot to do with mothers working outside the home.  As long as that is the norm then formula will be the norm because pumping is a royal pain in the can.  I find direct breastfeeding a lot more convenient then any other form of feeding and I've done all 3.  I pumped and formula fed my twins, I pumped in the beginning for my baby boy because my nipples were all blistered and scabbed, and pumping for milk is such a pain that you have to really commit to it in order to make it happen.<br>  <br>  I worked when my twins were babies and I couldn't keep up with their demands when it came to pumping and formula was so easy.<br>  <br>  Now I'm at home with my kiddos and I find breastfeeding a lot easier.|`|ExcaA1Oiaa	I really don't know when or why.  I, personally, get really tired of people saying that it's "easier" to formula feed.  Really?  It's easier to allow your baby to cry in the middle of the night while you grab a bottle, make some formula, heat up the water, make sure it's the right temperature, THEN feed your baby?  Well when my baby is hungry, I pull him out of his crib, sit in my rocking chair, pull out my breast and he eats.  <br>  <br>  I do know that there are so many women out there that have had serious problems breastfeeding - their milk didn't come in, they bleed, infections, etc.  And I don't agree with the way many nurses in hospitals force it on women - especially the ones who have tried and it hasn't worked.  But for those women who don't even bother because they don't want to - it's not about you, it's about the well-being of your child.  Breast milk is best, it's been proven time & time again.  Breastfeeding offers so many health benefits into & after toddlerhood:   reduced risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, increased intelligence, reduced likelihood of contracting middle ear infections and cold and flu bugs, reduced risk of some cancers such as childhood leukemia, lower risk of childhood onset diabetes, reduced risk of asthma and eczema, fewer dental problems, and reduced risk of obesity later in life.  Why wouldn't you want to breast feed, if you can?  My son is 4 months old now & I'm going back to work once a week in 3 weeks.  I'm pumping now so that he has enough milk to last the entire day.  I will breast feed him until he's 8 months old so that I can provide him with the nutrients and vitamins his body requires!|`|heDtLdz5aa	honestly..i think it is because women are just not that educated in it...i formula fed because that suited my family...i also would not have been able to because my milk never came in..not a drop..they never even got engorged and my breasts never even got big while i was pregnant...personally i think if i was more educated in the matter i probably would have made the decision while i was pregnant to breast feed... i would also want my husband to be educated in the matter to..many men just kinda trun their noses about it. honestly you think that tax dollars and such would be saved if women were more educated in the matter...women wouldn't have to go on wic.|`|3CVfUiiJaa	My opinion is, I didn't realize there was such a debate until I started coming to Y!A.  When I had my son, I did try breastfeeding, but he was very small and wasn't latching, even with a shield so the hospital said that he needed to have formula because he was hungry.  I wanted to make sure my son was fed properly because he was so darn small.  Before each feed I would try breastfeeding for 10 minutes on each side and he just wasn't getting it at all, and he was upset and frustrated, making it worse.<br>  I didn't feel a need to make him wait until he learned how to latch before he got fed.  In the end, maybe with more knowledge I would have done a better job, but my son is happy and healthy and growing very well.|`|tZt7fUYYaa	I think its because breasts are seen as sex objects for the partner rather than tools for feeding your baby. I certainly was weirded out by the idea of feeding my baby with them when my boyf had touched them and stuff sexually. I dont want him touching them now as i exclusively breast feed. I also want to be able to feed my baby anywhere but fear getting stared at or moaned at because some people find it gross. Mostly the older generation which i find really weird. I thought it was more normal back then. But my friend was feeding her son in her car in a supermarket carpark with a blanket over her breast so you couldnt see anything and an old woman banged on her window telling her she was disgusting doing that in public. I was horrified. I dont want an old lady doing that to me so i tend to limit my trips into town or something or send someone else. Its odd. Breast feeding it easy and cheap and im sure formula was only brought in to help women who had problems breast feeding as without it their babies would of starved i guess as people stopped using wet nurses in the very olden days. Well in this country anyway. I read that there are places where if there are a lot of breast feeding mothers they feed each others babies if the actual mother isnt available. But that would never be acceptable in the western world. Though i dont see why not. It would certainly make things easier. Lol....however i love bf my babs and its a breeze.      <br>  <br>  <br>  also i mentioned to my 8 year old step daughter that i was going to breast feed my daughter when she was born and she was horrified saying 'my mum thinks thats disgusting and she would never do that' I got really upset and angry towards her stupid mother. Its not disgusting and she is just ignorant. She never even bothered to try breast feeding her daughter and sometimes gives her crisps for breakfast now and toast for lunch and tea. She has no idea about anything....ooops...ranting.
kjAsuC6Haa	I think it depends. It's more usual around here for people to have kids when they're under 25--several of my friends had their first kids when they were 18--but I live in a blue-collar rural area, and I think we're more likely to start families younger.<br>  <br>  Among my white-collar college friends, we didn't start having kids until our late 20s and early 30s. I was 27 when I had my first, 31 with the second.<br>  <br>  I personally think 26 is a good age because you should be settled down in a job and have a stable place to live at that point; you know who you are at that age. But as long as you're mature enough to be a good parent and can support your children, then I don't think it really matters what age you are.|`|Bg6txvxqaa	My mum was 26 when she had me and I always thought it was quite old to start having kids. She had my sister at 29 nearly 30.<br>  <br>  I'm 21 and pregnant with twins, they are my firsts but I know plenty of people who were in my year in school who were having kids 2 and 3 years ago at 19, plus all those who were in my sisters year getting pregnant at 14 and 15.<br>  <br>  I really have no clue as to where they get their figures from especially with kids like Alfie having kids. He was 13 and he's not the only oe of that age which would make the average much lower.<br>  <br>  I think it is taken up to 26 though because those people who are married and thinking about having children now are much older as they want to have a life and career first so don't start trying til they are in they're 30's. Perhaps there are a lot more people of that age group getting pregnant than we know about.|`|T4t9ZtT7aa	It depends on you, i don't plan on having children before im 25. That way, im more likely to be financially stable and mature enough to bring up a child. It would not be plausible for me to have a child right now. I have not had any life experience and ive only recently stopped being a child myself (im 19) but it does depend on each woman, some are more capable of being a mother at a younger age but i just know i cant. And anyway, its only 6 years for me to wait. Im broody as hell but it would be unfair on me, my partner and the child to get pregnant now.|`|NGgUSm8Raa	i think that the birthrate has gone up ... and i  feel this way because i am a high school student and i see girls in my high school pregnant now an its not just 1 or 2 its like 5 or 6 now thats alot and its kids having kids ........... im not sayin that their not goin to raise thier child right but you only in high school you stilll have you life in front of you ...... you still have to graduate and go to collage  its jus to much|`|uGqYoZNEaa	I totally disagree.  Where I live it seems the age of my son's classmates parents are all in their early 40's, some mid to late 40's.<br>  <br>  I had my son at 21, ddaughter at 26.  Me and my husband have always been the youngest parents in extracurricular activites, our big thing is BMX which we do 4 times a week and event ravel for to other states.  It's bothersome in a way bcos ppl always assume that we were young and reckless (unplanned, but married) and are poor and get handouts.<br>  <br>  However old you are, just be prepared.  And I mean financially, mentally, physically, and be able to provide a happy home!|`|0QYIbn1saa	I had my child at 33, it is on the "older" end of the spectrum, but certainly not uncommon.  All of my friends are still single w/o kids (they are also my age) and have finished college and gone on to make careers for themselves (yet still plan to have children).  I think many couples are waiting longer so they can finish school, be very picky about the mate they choose (therefore dating longer before getting married), starting careers, and THEN starting a family.  Nothing at all against people who get married and have children young, I just personally know that I wouldn't have been as emotionally/financially secure had I started my family that young!|`|hl5WdXnbaa	Most people I know of are waiting until they are latter 20's or 30's. May seem "old" but it is not really. I feel better now at 32 then I did at 22!  Women are waiting because we live longer and are healthier in our older age than ever before so I find there is many women waiting.<br>  <br>  I personally wanted to wait until I finished school and was stable financially. Not 'relying on a man financially stable ( no offence to anyone) but being independently financially  stable so I could take care of myself and my kids on my own if need be. <br>  <br>  I do not care if a MOm is 21 or 41, as long as they are ready financially and emotionally all the power to them!|`|aGYvN9pfaa	It must be the area I live in but I'm 26 and pregnant with my first and people around me look at me like I'm a freak.

It actually looks more like a different way of spelling "Carrie"|`|C9845Dzvaa	It's very pretty, but maybe you should spell it Kyrie, or Kyree or Kyri|`|rTse8g3Xaa	I take it you're a fan of Kingdom Hearts? :D<br>  <br>  <br>  I like the names Ophelia, Kiley, Parker, Isabel, umm... yeah. Haha, I'm a bit picky with names. But Kairi is a cute name, and who cares if it gets mispronounced? It's easy enough to correct someone when they do.|`|qxnxm0YLaa	I like this name for a girl, but your spelling for this name will always yield a mispronounciation (Carrie). I went to grade school with a BOY name Kyrie (I think you should consider using this spelling). <br>  <br>  Middle names suggestions:<br>  Kyrie Lelani<br>  Kyrie Michelle<br>  Kyrie Nakia<br>  Kyrie Simone|`|s2F6pK9Xaa	I DO kinda like it, but I might like it a bit better if it were spelled Kyree. I think Carrie is wvwn better yet though. Carrie is so simple and sweet and down-to-earth.|`|d46b27856ae8a0c999a27247aed26a73aa	Leela Janine|`|Rx8U8eVnaa	I think when she gets to school it will be misinterpreted for carey a lot.

fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	There are signs that can be seen as early as 3 months, but not every child that has those signs will eventually be diagnosed with autism, and not every child that doesn't will not be autistic.<br>  <br>  The simple fact is that there is no test for autism, and there is no one set of criteria for diagnosing it.  Even if you go by the DSM definition of autism its still subjective and up to the person doing the diagnosis.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.autism-watch.org/general/dsm.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.autism-watch.org/general/dsm....</a><br>  Diagnostic Criteria for Autistic Disorder<br>  <br>  A.

The disturbance is not better accounted for by Rett's Disorder or Childhood Disintegrative Disorder.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.mugsy.org/pmh.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.mugsy.org/pmh.htm</a><br>  Diagnosis of autism is rare before the age of two years and is frequently much later6. It requires comprehensive, specialist assessment, which means primary health care workers being alert to the features of the condition and making the appropriate referral. Attwood9 notes that autism can be diagnosed in children as young as 18 months but in practice this may be hard to achieve, partly because of the nature of the disorder and partly because of lack of knowledge. Unfortunately at present a considerable number of professionals involved with young children do not recognise autism10, although it is hoped that this situation will improve and cases will be referred to specialists at younger ages for early intervention6. Nurses and nursery nurses who work with babies and young children are in a prime position to recognise possible early signs that warrant investigation.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,155241,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,1552...</a><br>  They developed a 16-point observational checklist called the Autism Observational Scale designed to map the development of infants as young as 6 months.<br>  <br>  Specific markers include making infrequent eye contact, not smiling in response to smiles from others, and, in older children, exhibiting delayed language skills.<br>  <br>  Even as early as 6 months of age, the researchers found that certain behaviors tended to distinguish siblings later diagnosed with autism from siblings who developed normally. These behaviors included passivity and a decreased activity level at 6 months of age, followed by extreme irritability, a tendency to fixate on objects, reduced social interaction, and lack of facial expression.<br>  <br>  At 1 year, these same children also tended to have difficulty with language and communication, and they used fewer gestures.<br>  <br>  Zwaigenbaum noted that almost all of the children in the study who were diagnosed with autism by age 24 months had seven or more of these markers by the time they were a year old.<br>  <br>  The findings are reported in the latest issue of the International Journal of Developmental Neuroscience.<br>  <br>  Signs ‘Not Necessarily a Cause for Concern’<br>  <br>  While the checklist may be useful for recognizing signs of autism in very high-risk children like the ones in the study, its relevance as an observational tool for other children is not yet known.<br>  <br>  “Many of these behaviors are pretty common in early development, so they are not necessarily a cause for concern,” Zwaigenbaum tells WebMD. “The next step is to take this experience working with high-risk infants out to the general community to see if these observations have meaning.”<br>  <br>  In the meantime, the findings may immediately lead to an earlier suspicion of autism and possibly earlier intervention in children at high risk.<br>  <br>  “The message is that we need to start working with these kids as early as possible instead of telling families that they should wait and see what happens,” Zwaigenbaum says.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.lestout.com/article/parenting-family/parenting-choices/what-are-the-early-signs-of-autism.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.lestout.com/article/parenting...</a><br>  Possible Signs of Autism at 3 Months:<br>  <br>      *  Not smiling at others.<br>      * Not making eye contact with parents.<br>  <br>      Possible Signs of Autism at 6 Months:<br>  <br>      * Not making eye contact with parents.<br>      * Not babbling or making cooing sounds.<br>      * Not imitating a smile when parents smile at child.<br>      * Not taking turns making sounds with parents.<br>      * Not participating in a game of peek-a-boo.<br>  <br>  Possible Signs of Autism at 12 Months:<br>   <br>  <br>      * Does not try to speak.<br>      * Does not point at items (when trying to communicate a want/need), wave at others, or grasp for objects.<br>      * Does not responsd when his/her name is called.<br>      * Repeats body motions (i.e. rocking back-and-forth or flaps hands in front of face/down side of body).<br>      * Becomes fixated on an object.<br>      * Becomes oversensitive to textures, smells, sounds.<br>      * Struggles when there is a change in routine.<br>      * Loses language that he/she once had.<br>         <br>  <br>  Possible Signs of Autism at 24 Months:<br>  <br>      * Does not verbally say two-word phrases independently.<br>      * Loses language or developmental skills (had it in the past, but now he/she doesn't have it).<br>  <br>  It is important to note that if your child demonstrates any of these early signs of autism, it doesn't necessarily mean that he/she is autistic.  It does, however, mean that your child's physician and you need to monitor the child's exhibit of the behaviors. If they do not improve, an assessment may need to be done to determine whether or not your child is autistic as well as whether he/she needs to receive services for an early intervention.  Some websites are showing clips of videos of children with and without autism to help parents and physicians have a visual sense of behaviors that are related to autism and those that are not.  This information can be found on the MSNBC website.|`|ds5MCdS5aa	Generally, you don't see symptoms till the child is between 3 and 5.  However, i have a friend with an autistic son, and they caught it at about 18 months.  Their son is doing REALLY well thanks to the early detection........Good luck to you!|`|NSHZUQyOaa	from 2 years + you can see some signs but without testing they can be mistaken for other things. Some signs include: A remarkable understanding of shapes and colours and Symmetry, the child might not hold eye contact for very long or might not engage in eye contact at all even when their name is said. Little verbal Communication is another sign or noises that seem unusual. Screaming, hisses or growls. They may not understand commands you give them and fins it difficult to understand a lot of things. A lack of interest in normal toys and games is another sign. there are many signs but without testing they could mean nothing at all or relate to other things such as ADHD.|`|fs3gUe6Caa	I began to see signs in my child with autism as early as 6 months (maybe earlier) even though I was not prepared to acknowledge them at that point.  I remember it was always a struggle to get her attention and having her look at me long enough for a photograph was impossible...I blamed it on the snap time of our stupid camera :)  By 8 months her social disinterest became more pronounced which I caught myself making excuses for and she became fixated on our coaster set.  She would put them into the coaster holder one at a time shiny side up and if one flipped upside down she would dump them out and start again.  She was able to crawl and walk on "schedule" but seemed to lack the motivation to do it and was content to collect/study/reposition her favourite toys rather than explore her environment.  At 12 months she was still not responding to her name, had no gestures, no social interest, "sticky" about changes to her environment, no appropriate speech (she would sometimes repeat/echo what someone said but didn't use words to label things...this is a VERY important distinction) and other sign I didn't recognize as relevant at the time.<br>  Long story short, we knew from a very early age but she was not diagnosed officially until the age of 2 (her Dr's were reluctant to give a diagnosis at such a young age and the process took us about 10 months).  Between the ages of 18months and 3yrs there was a definite  increase in symptoms and her "echoed words" stopped.  During this part of development, the brain goes through a big growth period and the needs/demands of/on the child increase (if they arn't processing information correctly this significantly affects behaviour). That's probably why it's not uncommon for children at the higher functioning end of the spectrum to slide under the radar until they are 2-3 when their challenges become more noticeable.  And there are cases where children appear to be developing typically and then begin to experience a "regression" during that 18month to 3 year period.  But in many cases of autism (especially the more classic form of autism), there are red flags present by the first year and definitely before 18months.|`|IuJjYz6gaa	Around 12 months most people notice the first real signs.  I think that's why so many people blame it on the MMR because they happen to notice the first signs.<br>  <br>  I think the first small signs are really very early, no eye contact, doesn't like to be held, etc.  But those don't ALWAYS mean that there is a problem.
UgX5WeGPaa	HEY..HEY..HEY... I'M HERE!!! i've been limiting my yahoo cause i wasn't doing any work!!!!  i text you though, like last week!  and emailed you.. and sent you facebook request... i'm still new with it so i could have messed up!!!  i LIKE FACEBOOK WAY better than myspace...<br>  <br>  honesly... myspace is bigger with YOUNG people... everyone in the world i know is on facebook!!! myspace is sort of like the high school cool thing to do..hahahahahahhahaha|`|trXjBRlRaa	I have both but use FB more. It is easier to get on and off (though does have the same tendancy to zap the hours away thus major time management necessar). I also find that on FB you can just do a quick status update instead of writing an entire blog. You have the same photo capabilities, which I find they load more quickly than MySpace, and you have better control over your privacy settings.<br>  <br>  Overall I think it is more flexible and offers wider options.|`|kjAsuC6Haa	I have both. I kind of like Facebook better, just because I've found more of my friends there and I don't feel like such a teenybopper; it's got more of an "adult" vibe. It is harder to use, I think.<br>  <br>  With MySpace you can get more creative and it's more user-friendly.|`|1gF9QVy9aa	I must be the only one here who has neither!!  My husband and I feel that there is no need to publicize our personal info for the internet world to read.

I'm on there more, but I do have other friends who are on both, so I still use both.|`|0QYIbn1saa	I have both, I spend more time on Facebook but still check my Myspace often.  I enjoy adding mommy friends to both, also!  If anyone wants my link let me know :)|`|AA12145826	I have both. Myspace is fun because I can customize it more, but Facebook is pretty user friendly plus its where I spend most of my time (if I'm not on here of course, LoL).|`|8zdPI8Qsaa	I have both.... but have grown to like facebook much more. I only have myspace now for my few friends who won't get a facebook :-)|`|rB3cyt0Paa	Myspace is way cooooooooooooooooler|`|GEigVt7Waa	I have both...but facebook is so much better :) plus i find more people are on facebook than myspace these days|`|XPnCeJ29aa	I only have a myspace..<br>   :)|`|oR3v2IUmaa	I have both and I like Myspace much better!!|`|5OJ5WUUdaa	I have both.<br>  i like facebook better|`|VwMkiLFPaa	I have both and I’m most likely going to delete my Myspace. I don’t like all the fancy pages and stuff. Facebook seems more simple and basic. <br>  <br>  However I’d like to delete both. But I’d miss staying in contact with friends. I’m having issues with a certain SIL that likes to cause problems anything and everything.|`|EtCRnDJMaa	I have both.  I've had myspace longer.  Just started to use facebook.  I have different friends on both.  The ones who have a both are friends on both, but on facebook I have re connected with friends i went to school with in grade school, ones who i've know since like Kindergarten.  So that's fun too!  <br>  myspace is more personal, maybe because i know how to create the page that's "just for me"  vs facebook is just plain, just a web page with notes from friends.  Both are very different in their own ways, & i like each one in it's own way.|`|xXnFx6qLaa	Come to facebook!!!!  I get to talk to V (Ayden's Mommy) almost everyday!!!!  <br>  <br>  I have both.  I'm addicted to both.  However, I have found a lot more people that I haven't spoken to in years on facebook.  And it's easy to understand once you work with it for a while.|`|j2mRop0laa	I only have a facebook which I got to share pics and *chat* with my YAers. I have a bunch of pics on facebook. I think you can do however many you want?<br>  <br>  I guess, at this point I prefer facebook. Although, I do wish they had the music option.|`|Wjdpm4xNaa	I have both facebook and Myspace.  There are things about both I like better.  I feel like facebook is more "real" where as myspace there are a lot of weirdos and fake profiles going around.  But I like that you can customize your page on myspace.|`|AA11210211	I have both but I like myspace better,I do graphic design and it is easier to share all my work on myspace.|`|AA12221392	I have both. <br>  I think I like facebook better than myspace, just because it is a little user friendly,faster to get on and off of as well. <br>  <br>  I like the fact that you can design you pages on myspace,and also you can add music files ect... So people get more of a sense of you.<br>  <br>  I do agree pictures load alot faster for face book then myspace. <br>  <br>  i have friends on one and not the other so I have to keep them both...|`|XOtOMncwaa	I only have myspace, it's enough of a distraction, so I've never had a facebook, I tried it out once and ended up deleting it. I would love to add people to my myspace, my friends are so boring on there ha ha! But I've never had anyone ask me about it, so I don't have any Y!A people on my myspace. <br>  But I guess I would have to say myspace is better, only because I only used facebook for like a day.<br>  If anyone wants to add me heres the link... <br>  Just tell me what your Y!A name is so I know who you are.... <br>  <a href="http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&friendid=273629285" rel="nofollow">http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fus...</a>|`|Fy9S6hjIaa	I have both, and there are things I like better about both.  Facebook is easier to use and has the "chat" option which I love.  Myspace has more personal options with page layouts and music on your page.  Its also easier to organize and share pictures.  Both are awesome, and honestly I have alot of different contacts on each!|`|MxhNzW7Oaa	I have both but I like MySpace so much better.<br>  <br>  Facebook kind of confuses me.

That really was a step in the right direction. Good luck and best wishes.|`|9mLGFqdxaa	You could be pregnant but it might just be stress. Take the test in the morning.|`|af2136bcacd19dc5b2bab9b0737163c9aa	It sounds like you had implantation bleeding hun, this happens about a week before your period is suppose to be due and it usually only shows when you wipe and it can be anywhere from brown to pink spotting. now another option is that it can also be your period tricking you because you didnt take the birth control how you were suppose to. I think its alright to test already because you're pretty late. good luck hun. if it turns out you're not pregnant I suggest getting on the depo (shot) every 3 months it's much more reliable than to take a pill every single day at the same time.|`|cix2DEbbaa	Ouch hun it sounds like to me you had implantation bleeding, I say ask your mom to go to the walk in clinic with you & than they will take a urine or blood test because I`m not too sure when you really should take a home one either considering you were on the pill & what not. If you were already suppose to be expecting a period say two weeks ago like you knew it was suppose to come I would say take one now, but still go to the doctors or clinic.<br>  <br>  Good luck hun <3
44ccf078ecbbb80711e26204438034abaa	First off I am so sorry... And this Is NOT your fault. You did nothing to deserve this. He just sounds like a self centered jerk who views you as the one who should take care of the kids and he should be allowed to do whatever he wants. Well that is CRAP! <br>  <br>  I'd tell him everything you told us but I'd do that knowing full well this pry isn't going to go well and I'm pry going to have to tell mom in advance that i'm doing this and might need to come stay with her. More than likely if he's this selfish he's going to fight you tooth and nail and make this all your fault. Maybe not and I'm really hoping for your sake he isn't going to be like that... but we should always prepare for worst case scenario! That way there is no suprise and we aren't nearly as hurt. Of course we should hope for the best and hope for change but we might not get it.<br>  <br>  If he says he'll change keep on him and I might suggest parenting classes together. I know you don't need them but if you suggest you both go to them maybe he'll go. I'd also tell him that you get equal time alone out of the house to what he gets. That's only fair. That will curb his going out 12 hours every day I'm sure. After he's spent 12 hours by himself with the kids he'll pry opt for alot less time out! LOL! <br>  <br>  Again i'm really sorry for all this. Even if you do leave him things will get better. I have a 6 year old boy and nearly 5 year old girl. They are so easy anymore. They aren't even work they are a joy. I felt very overwhelmed and over worked when they were little too just like you... I just don't feel that way anymore. They help me for pete's sake... And my husband wasn't always the most helpful but he's changed and now he's a wonderful father and husband. We've grown in to great parents and great spouses to one another... But that took time! So have faith that even if he wasn't the one... someone else is!|`|ddP3klT3aa	The baby is only 3 weeks old. You really don't need to get a sitter and go out with it being so young. You need to hand the baby to your husband and tell him you are going out for an hour. Just hand him the baby. If he tries to leave in the morning, tell him you need help. Men are not mind readers. What have you don't to correct this? Have you said any thing to him? <br>  Moving back in with your mom really should not be an option. You got into this mess. And it could be worse. You just need better communication with your husband. Marriage takes WORK. And you have to try. Your mom shouldn't be put under the stress of you and 2 kids all of a sudden.|`|0unqJPehaa	He is not working but is gone from 7am till 7pm?  I would be worried....he could be cheating..and it sounds like the way he is acting he could be cheating.., that are some of the signs.  I would look into that, get a private investigator or a good friend to fallow him around.<br>  <br>  I would leave him for now and go to your moms, see how he will act when your gone, see if he will care or not. It's good to stay with your mom so maybe she can help you, unlike your jackass husband.<br>  <br>  Sorry to say he could be cheating, but those were some of the signs my dad was showing and my mom and I found out he was cheating..|`|e29b0c8b08bfccce474d6efcc471aa17aa	I'm sorry to hear that, it must be difficult to be going through this with two small children. <br>  <br>  You need to try to talk to him and work through it. If that doesn't work, here's my blunt advice: Leave the jerk. It will be a tough road, but in the end everything will be better. You deserve better, and so do your kids. There are really amazing people out there, and there's someone for you who will love you and take care of you and your kids.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|uGqYoZNEaa	First off you need to tell your husband exactly how you feel.  These two kids are his just as much as they are yours.  There is no reason he should be gone, and gone where?, if he's not working.  How would it be if you got up and just left?  You better believe he'd surely say something then!  Tell him today, vent ifyou need to.  HOnestly, it's your right.  Suggest things you can do to help if needed for financial reasons for your family.  Don't just run away, it'll only make it worse.
hVVALFAPaa	I am sorry that you have to go through this, especially with a toddler and a newborn.<br>  <br>  I know you are under stress trying to deal with the needs of a toddler and a fussy newborn, plus I am sure you have stress with your husband not working.<br>  <br>  He is probably stressed too, knowing he can't take financial care of his family, and feeling a bit superfluous with the kids--since you sound like their primary caregiver.<br>  <br>  I would suggest that you think about your kids -- would THEY be better or worse with or without daddy in the picture? Maybe you need a cooling off period but I would hope you don't do anything permanent or reckless yet.<br>  <br>  Tell him gently and sweetly EXACTLY what kind of help you need. "Honey, I NEED for you to watch the kids each night from 7-8 pm so I can take a bath. I NEED for you to make sure X, Y, and Z get done. And I could really use a bit of time for just us. Could you take me to a movie, PLEASE?" Give him some time to start working on 'your list.' THEN if he cannot step up to the plate and be a dad and husband, go to your moms. He may need that kick in the pants to wake up and be a man.<br>  <br>  Courage, dear, and think about your kids first.|`|pXSKSS3daa	I'd be wondering what he's doing for those 12 hours if he's not working.<br>  <br>  Go ahead and pack up you and your boys and leave. Maybe that will be a big slap in his face that he needs to get his act together(if you're still wanting to work things out). He sounds like he wasn't/isn't ready to be committed to a family. If you're that miserable, which is understandable, then get yourself out of there.|`|AA11779376	Did you try talking to him about it?<br>  I mean talking not nagging, yelling or complaining.<br>  You could make the first effort to a night out. Suggest to him that you want someone to babysit while the two of you go out together, just to see what he says. In the best case scenario: He may feel like you have no time for him and he doesn't know what to do. And all you need is to reconnect with him. Try talking about how you miss doing things with him and how you need to plan a date night together. Also while he's home try having him hold the baby a few times and make comments about how much the baby loves being held by him. Then talk about future things he can do with the baby like; going fishing or other guy stuff. He may just need to know that you and kids need him in your lives.<br>  <br>  But if you try this and he has no interest then I would say to give him warning. Tell him how you feel about him not wanting anything to do with you or the kids and if he doesn't start acting like a part of the family he's not going to be a part of it anymore. Then all you have to do is live up to what you say. <br>  But please try the other nicer stuff first.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps. Good luck!
w10EYKrkaa	I know exactly what you mean! There was a great article in Take a Break a few weeks back about this kind of thing.<br>  <br>  Good Example - I go out to work full time and have a 4 year old daughter and I'm always hearing people say I should be spending time with her, not going straight back to work (as i did when she was 5 months old). I should be at home looking after the house and giving my child the best start.  Now my friend has a 3 year and chooses to stay at home, and is constantly hearing people telling her how she is lazy and should be thinking about going back to work to set a good example.<br>  <br>  AAAARRGGGHHHH.<br>  <br>  Truth is, not matter what you do there will always be someone who thinks you should be doing someone else.  But its our right to do what is best for ourselves and our children.|`|0QYIbn1saa	"Why can't we just be left to do what is best for us and our families?"<br>  <br>  We can, and that's exactly what I do.

Fried food, ice cream, butter!  I do wish I'd had kids younger, but I also wish I'd gotten into medical school, but 'life isn't fare' and many of directions our live's take us aren't our own choices.  Sex with a condom isn't the same as sex with a condom, but having sex without carries both positive risks and negative ones.<br>  <br>  I like the song from the group Five for Fighting that says that (my) Parents did the best thing they knew how to do.  I firmly believe that and I try to do my best everyday.  I think a lot of people do and so I try to give the benefit of doubt to most people.|`|AA12005445	I was happily married when I had my first child in my early twenties and it made me and my husband very happy.  Circumstances changed and I was the single parent of a three and a half year old child.<br>  20years after the first child was born  my then boyfriend of 12years and myself parted  company 3 days before I realised I was pregnant at the age of 43.  Although I didnt use my pregnancy to reunite with her dad he still sees her now and again and they are both happy with the situatiion it left all 3 of us in. My second child has always told me she prefers an older mother.  Even when in primary school and now that she is in her early 20s she is still  content with an older mum.<br>  MY POINT IS do what you feel is best for all 3 of you  to cope with. I have dealt with it from all angles and problems will always arise not matter what you do in life.   The best advice is to learn to cope with problems as and when they arrive as no matter what you do in life nothing turns out perfect.  we can only do our best|`|EtCRnDJMaa	who cares what other people think any way??  if you have kids at a young age then you do, if you wait then wait, who really cares??? When it happens it happens........that's what's wrong with people today, they worry about what everybody else is doing or thinking instead of doing what's right for them|`|uP08b6K4aa	Couldn't agree more!  <br>  <br>  Do what I do, don't read the papers or if you do, take little notice and the same goes for the daily news on television.  I take it all with a pinch of salt to be honest especially where my children are concerned.<br>  <br>  When I was pregnant with my children, there was little said in the news as to what you could eat (apart from mayonnaise I believe) or couldn't eat.  My mother smoked through all he<br>  r pregnancies and none of us have an adverse effect from it (although none of us smoke), she ate everything she wanted and also had the odd drink.  <br>  <br>  During my childhood I went out to play in the cold, wet and the sunshine but never caught a cold, I played in the mud with my brothers and never got an infection, and if I dropped food on the floor I picked it up and brushed off the dirt and ate it !!<br>  <br>  I have been married and had children with my husband, but we separated so that clearly wasn't a good life choice!  I'm not married now but have a fantastic partner and my family doesn't need us to be married to prove it will last forever.  I have been a parent who has worked AND stayed at home (although not for long) and my children have not suffered through me doing one or the other.<br>  <br>  As I said, pinch of salt with it all!|`|b4b38acbe2582b7a823dd09b00982594aa	With the amount of people in this world if you do anything (from how you raise your family to what you do for a living, etc) someone will think it's wrong. There are so many opinions out there that you can't please everyone. Do what is right for you and ignore what other's say. As long as you aren't hurting yourself or anyone else then what does it matter?|`|3d4c397558f23336e0a364b9a2a773fbaa	You're right. We've got 3 children and have been together for nearly 13 years although we are not officially "married". 13 years is a lot longer than some married couples last. One day these so-called experts will realise that mothers know best...|`|prqrQcd1aa	We can be.. simple solution is to just do what is best for you and your family and take everything everyone else says with a grain of salt!|`|QnJvJ67uaa	No matter what you do you will never give them the right food/education/ toys/ after school activities/ amount of "quality time" etc...Do what you want and stick your tongue out at the narrow minded people.<br>  I am a SAHM as is my best friend..one day she was talking to my neighbour (working mum, kids in full time daycare) and she actually said to my friend "Oh you stay home?

hSJnaysiaa	That's going to depend on your area and the "going rate" for the most part, it varies from place to place so you might ask like your moms group or look on craigslist or something.<br>  <br>  We live in WA state and I nanny and the wage really varies from town to town. We lived in Seattle and I charge $16/hr for nannying, light housekeeping (picking up after the kids, kids laundry, etc). Well now we moved down to Vancouver, WA (8 miles north of Portland, OR) and I am pregnant. I still nanny, but because my son will be going with me to work, and because of the wage differences between here and Seattle, I now am only making $700/month for full-time care for one child.
eJMIazhLaa	I've never heard of a girl named Damian...it's different, cute, but different.  I like the name Evan Blake for a boy though!|`|AA11626101	The girl's name doesn't flow.<br>  The guy's name -- you don't want to have "K" followed by "G". It's harsh-sounding.<br>  <br>  Other than that, both names are pretty awful and will be outdated by the time the kids are in high school.|`|AA12373941	Try Ethan Blake and it's a Hit from me.<br>  <br>  Your girl name choice is double rubbish - too male.  She'll be assumed to have been born male and will never marry.|`|68d4d4f4566a20affea781e7789c9a94aa	I love Evan Blake or Ethan Blake, but in my opinion Damian is in no way at ALL for a girl. <br>  good luck|`|AjqO1aJgaa	You've made a mistake here. Damian is a boy's name and all the others are surnames.|`|dd8cb229ee241de8ca385f84ec4b33d7aa	Evan Blake is a great name for a boy<br>  Love it, Evan Goins is good too<br>  <br>  Damian is a boys name<br>  I really do not like Damian for a boy, I hate it for a girl<br>  I think it's not very good for a girl<br>  Paige Goins is fine|`|yOyg3gnJaa	I like Evan for the boys name, and I think Damian for a girl is cut-throat and horrible.  It's definitely a boys name, and I don't even like it for a boy.  It's just not a good choice.  Paige, that's more feminine, I would expect that as a first name and go with a simple middle name.|`|a5d3a73a2b18184ae9f44125b6ed78e0aa	Damian is terrible for a girl. I think of a big masculine man! Evan Blake is very nice, but I think I would like Evan Blaine a bit better since Blake is being used for girls a lot lately.|`|Fsr2Rofzaa	no, I don't like the name Damien, it almost has the evil effect on me as the name Cain.  I do like Evan though|`|mc6YtaRbaa	Honestly I think Damian is a boy's name. Paige is cute though.|`|tSEA42Uraa	Oh my God! That's simply horrible! Damian on a GIRL?!<br>  <br>  It's purely, solely, ONLY a boy's name. A respectable boy's name.

Just a suggestion...<br>  <br>  Good luck in whatever you choose, both are great names, congrats!|`|r6TijtS8aa	I personally like Ethan better, without knowing the meaning, but TYler is nicce too|`|cn2rvsdOaa	I love them both but would go with Ethan!|`|ewDKMeJkaa	i like tyler better|`|3c51ba3982b4a0fa984f838020963690aa	Hmm... I like both Tyler and Ethan.  The problem is Rayne, your non-negotiable name.  How about at least change the spelling?  It's because it's too feminine -- makes it a girly name.  You really don't want that for your son, and I'm surprised your husband is the one who's so set on it.  Is there a reason for it?  Is it a friend or family name?  Would he mind at least changing it to "Rain" or something else?<br>  <br>  Remember that Tyler is usually called "Ty" -- do you like "Ty" for a name?<br>  <br>  Ethan has no nicknames, which is actually a nice thing, I think.|`|LoP2CRE2aa	I prefer Tyler actually. I have never been one to put too much thought into meanings, however.<br>  <br>  I love my name (Paige) and the meaning is basically a servant boy (young male apprentice I think), but I still love it!|`|AA12090960	I reckon Ethan sounds more better and tyler a bit common but then tyler could stand out more than ethan. Although I don't like either, I would prefer Ethan more over tyler. Why not just name him rayne with no other names?|`|iAfmejYTaa	ethan|`|b54a2cb9535d4ff522bf752b6fcd8723aa	Ethan Rayne sounds better!|`|4TNavgDuaa	I like Ethan better.|`|yrxENGqbaa	um both are cute talk about dont decide between peoples answers its your child.|`|OdBt1TQZaa	i like tyler better but they are both very cute names|`|6xf1GfbUaa	Because in Ethan-Rayne both names end with a "N" sound, I don't think they go very well.<br>  Tyler-Rayne is a very nice and unique name. Tyler ends with a "R" sound and Rayne begins with a "R" sound, so they complement each other. It's actually a very nice name! When you say it out loud, it's like the two names are together, does that make sense? <br>  About the meaning, it's not a "bad" meaning. It may not mean something really nice, but it's definitely "doable" because it doesn't have an offensive or "ugly" meaning. It's ok :)|`|AA12373941	Ethan, although both suck to be honest.  Rayne as a family name is one thing, but a hyphenated name is so pretentious - think about his image when he's signing on or getting his methadone.|`|a86f6424902f7b5848aa6e3ff154afa2aa	I like Ethan but Ethan Rayne was a character in the Buffy series - he was a baddie!|`|gQEFy4BVaa	Ethan is much better than Tyler. It will age well.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't hyphenate them though, it's pointless and cheapens the whole thing. Ethan Rayne would be fine.|`|b639f61d656c58882c6d485d251a34e1aa	Hahaha. I love your additional comments. <br>  <br>  I actually like Rayne as a first name.<br>  <br>  Kieran Rayne sounds cool<br>  or Kian Rayne<br>  <br>  Garrett Rayne<br>  Isaac Rayne<br>  Zack Rayne|`|4uJ3asPVaa	I like ethan =] plus you dont want ur baybee gettting made fun of in skool cuz of his name. I went thru it & even as an adult people still laff at my names (first & middle together sound funny)|`|7ybsWg4xaa	Ethan. Congratulations on having a little boy xxx|`|ZCpxYtEHaa	I like Ethan better because you dont see it as often as you see Tyler. I only know one Ethan and like six Tylers.|`|QJf2XNaTaa	Ethan..

I think it flows a bit nicer than Tyler...<br>  <br>  Despite what Halo Mom says, I know a kid who has the middle name Rayne, but I can't remember how he spells it. I think it makes a good name for either gender, and if it isn't their name, its going to be something else that they get teased for. So I wouldn't worry about them having a name that means queen, besides there are worse meanings out there... <br>  <br>  To be honest though, I don't like either name all that well, but for as long as I can remember, Tyler wasn't my favorite name ever, and Ethan I am on the fence about...|`|uJNVAA3saa	Tyler. I love that name ?
1YdeUn1Caa	Your husband grew up around it, and he turned out fine. Your baby will too, if you let him. <br>  Nothing has changed, except your husband has you in his life now.|`|pXSKSS3daa	Suggest leaving a shirt/smock at your house for her to change into and, of course, always make sure she washes her hands or at the very least uses sanitizer.<br>  <br>  I understand you may not want to offend her but you also have to look out for your very young infant's health.|`|tZt7fUYYaa	Oh goodness your in the same boat as me. My partners dad smokes cigars and while he doesnt smoke them around my daughter their house stinks of it. You go in there for 10 mins and come out reeking. I dont like my baby going to their house because she comes home smelling awful and i find that unnatural. I told her granma how i felt and nothing has changed. I know its his house and he should be able to do as he likes, but i cant stand the smell of it on a newborn and w now 3 month old little girl. its not right. So i am reluctant to let her go there, i dont want her not to see her grandparents but im upset by it. My boyf brings her home and i start to Breastfeed her and all i can smell is cigars. Its awful,So i have asked my boyfriend to mention it again as if it doesnt stop they will just have to come here instead and we wont go there.|`|nmu6coapaa	I would say something and I have said something to my own MIL! She always stinks of smoke too so I've told her if she plans to come see him, not to be smoking beforehand! If it offends her, I dont care! It's my son and I'm going to do whatever I can to keep him safe and if she doesn't like it then too bad! I've even convinced them to keep the living room in their house smoke free!|`|4e67Pdfvaa	you said it yourself, its Just the smell.. smoke "smell" is not going to do anything.. its just gross.  They can't get sids from the smell, that is rediculous! (to the girl who said it)  <br>  I wouldn't say anything direct, but you might wan't to tease her about the baby smelling like an ashtray after she holds it.. that might get her to think a little without you saying anything rude.|`|DDIBEvUTaa	if it's really that bad then you should say something.  <br>  If it's not too bad, maybe just wrap baby in a blanket when she holds her & that way you can easily contain & remove the smell from baby.  <br>  I had similar issues w/ my dad.  He doesn't see why he should ever have to wash his hands, after touching garbage, going to the bathroom, whatever.  He actually held my son (I didn't know until later) after he had reached waist-deep in into our outside trash bin where we dispose of our cats' poo!!  I just told him, "sorry, I don't mean any offense, I'm probably just being a paranoid new mother, but I would really like it if you were better about washing your hands, & made sure to change your shirt after doing dirty things."  I didn't have to say much about his cigarette stink- jonah screamed his head off when he tried to hold him & he smelled of smoke.  But I do the blanket deal with my dad.  It makes it easier for all of us.<br>  : )|`|OLW0Irbhaa	Would you have a problem saying something to someone who was smoking around your newborn?  Probably not.  Why one earth would you have a problem telling her? She needs to change her clothes and wash her hands before she holds the baby.  She'll probably get ticked but oh well.  Your baby's right to breathe cleanly outweighs her disgusting and dangerous habit.  We have friends that the grandma smokes and she isn't allowed to pick up the baby unless she changes and washes up.  And do not under any circumstances let her smoke around the baby.  Exposure to smoke increases the risks for SIDS.|`|heDtLdz5aa	that kinda puts you in between a rock and a hard place..a baby still breaths in second hand smoke off a persons clothes... maybe ask her before she comes over if she could sustain from smoking ciggarettes and if she does have one...maybe ask her to wash her hands and maybe keep a shirt or sweater around the house that she could slip on before she holds the baby..sounds kinda crazy but i wouldn't want my son smeeling like smoke either|`|jrVlzffeaa	It's not good for the baby to smell this. It's a toughy as you don't want to offend her, try to get your husband to have a word with her about it, I would definitely have to say something, i can not stand the smell of it!! Good luck Xx|`|iAfmejYTaa	tell her not to smoke around the baby or b4 she holds it. tell her that until she stops that that she cant b around the baby......not just for the smell but its REALLY bad for the baby. im talkin SIDS here|`|Bg6txvxqaa	The poisons in cigarette smoke sticks around in that persons breath for a while afterwards. Long after they put that cigarette out so if she is breathing on your baby, that is pretty much second hand smoke.<br>  <br>  I would tell her she's not to go near the kids at all if she's had a cigarette in the last hour.<br>  <br>  It's better than them getting sick from it. If she doesn't like it, it's tough! I'll be tellign my nan the same thing cos she smokes. And their dad if he doesnt quit soon.|`|FLEXqVoiaa	If you can smell the smoke on her, then all of the chemicals are present. She could have given your son a rash. YES you should say something. Ask that if she's going to smoke on the way to your house, that she wear a jacket she can take off before coming in your house-That way the chemicals and stench will stay on the jacket. Also it's important she washes her hands before touching your baby. <br>  My dad is a smoker and my son has really sensitive skin. When my son was just a couple of weeks old, he developed a rash right in the areas my dad's hands had been.|`|VS78dqO9aa	I completely disagree with Emily.  Smoking, whether it be around or just the smell on the clothes of someone, can cause health problems from your precious baby.  You can ask your child's doctor.  when a child, especially a newborn, has parents who smoke, the doctors suggest having a certain jacket to wear while you're smoking, coming in afterwards washing hands and brushing teeth.  The inhalation of smoke of an infant, can cause RSV, Pneumonia, ear infections, and much much more.  I would simply talk to her.  If it doesn't work, the have your husband talk to her, and then if it goes any further, then maybe more drastic precautions should be taken, but I'm sure she will respect your wishes.  good luck....and always feel free to email.|`|ZusC87WBaa	Truthfully, I wouldn't say anything.  For one thing, and i'm sure a lot of people are going to thumbs-down me for this one, but smokers are very defensive people.  Even if you think you are being reasonable, she is not going to.  I would have more concern if she was smoking around the baby.  I do understand where you are coming from though.  I came from a family of smokers and it is unfortunate that I have to be more understanding of their choices than they are of mine.|`|68d4d4f4566a20affea781e7789c9a94aa	I know it is a hard situation, but I have been there. That is your baby and if you don't want someone holding the baby for any reason that is your right. Not only for the smell but believe it or not just a baby smelling smoke on clothing is like second hand smoke for them. a doctor once told me that. You need to step up and say - I'm sorry please don't hold them right now and explain your not comfortable because of the smell. <br>  good luck.|`|XLC3QDQ9aa	You should discuss this with your husband and have either him tell him [since it's his mom] or the both of you tell her.<br>  <br>  I don't like anyone that smells like smoke to come near my toddler, let alone when she was a baby. You need to say something, mother-in-law or not. I'm not saying be rude about it either.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|LpqLHa5maa	SPEAK UP. They are your kids you had them. Tell them the truth but also let them know that your not trying to be mean but you don't want your kids to smell like a ashtray. And that if you don't smoke around them you don't want them to.|`|FsFUo4VJaa	I would tell her that she has to wash her hands and try not to smell  so bad when she comes over it is sad but I would for sure tell her whats up you dont want to have your kid smelly. good luck.|`|nlyFyNpVaa	If you're really bothered by it, I would say just ask her to try to make sure that she's finished her cigarette at least 10mins before she comes over to see the baby.|`|1PLYMAR6aa	Nothing. If she smokes around her, then you have something to complain about.|`|AA11779376	You could offer her a burping cloth to place over her shoulder while she holds the baby. that way the baby isn't coming into direct contact with her cloths. Also suggest that everyone wash there hands before hold baby.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps. but short of spraying her with fabreeze I don't think there is much you can do about the smell.<br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  -Edit- <br>  Since it is your husbands mother and he is closer to her than you are. You should have him tell her about the risks of second hand smoke and that no one smoking or who smells like smoke can hold the baby until they clean up first. His mother is more likely to listen to him and not get offended. <br>  <br>  I'm going to have to do it with my family because quite a few of them smoke. My husband has asthma so I'm scared to death that the baby will develop it also and smoke/second hand can cause a reaction. So I know they won't all be thrilled but I know they all want whats best for the baby. So they'll listen.|`|Y6K9jwXzaa	my mother-in-law is the same way. i can't stand the woman. the over does the perfume/lotion and touches and holds my son after smoking. i haven't really said anything directly to her, but i have hinted that she should wash her hands before touching him.
dbafItLvaa	I just asked my doc about this Tuesday.  I told her it feels like there has been a bowling ball sitting on my pelvis all day!  I'm only 22w 5d, and she said with second children this happens earlier because everything has been stretched out already, so it happens sooner. She told me to just put my feet up when I feel like that to relieve some pressure. Good luck.|`|VS8mactUaa	A baby can flip to head down up to 1 - 2 weeks before labor begins, so Id say it is very normal. just stay off your feet as much as possible, and if you feel light headed, ust lie down for a bit, since the baby can pinch a nerve. Good Luck|`|OJFz0LBZaa	i have had that feeling for a few weeks now as mine was also head down, but went for a assessment yesterday and she has moved and the pressure has gone now abit, your baby could still move positions, if your worried though i would talk to your midwife but being head down and having pressure does not mean you will have your baby early though|`|Ccq8zEcnaa	It's hard to tell if you will deliver early just from you having pressure down below. I suggest you start wearing a pregnancy support belt to help alleviate some of the uncomfortable pressure and see if that helps. The pressue is most likely the baby dropping into your pelvis, but this can happen weeks before a delivery.|`|v4xIauuYaa	my friend had the same with her second and yes her baby came early check with your doctor Congrats.|`|0vpDDM8aaa	probably just means your baby has dropped...and they can "stay dropped" for awhile :o)|`|1VnWhP1Saa	I wouldn't worry the pressure you're feeling is from where bubs is engaged. With second or more babies they can go in & out of engagement during the last weeks. Also as you have had a baby already your muscles tend to be slightly weaker which is why you maybe feeling it earlier this time. Unless you're getting regular pains & no signs of loss I wouldn't worry yourself. If you are very concerned or anything changes give your madwife or mat unit a buzz, they are there to help you & you're not a bother :-)|`|h9q1wMbQaa	run it past your ob.  It wouldn't hurt to get an ultrasound done.  I had lots of uncomfortable pressure the last week and thank goodness I had gestational diabetes as I had weekly ultrasounds during the last month.  My son had to come 2 weeks early because the pressure was from losing water.  I had lost almost 50 percent of my water, it just dissipated, there was no leak. I was induced and had to have my water broken to speed it up.   My only symptom was the pressure and had I not gotten the ultrasound, my lil man (who will be 8 months old tomorrow) may not have been ok.<br>  <br>  Good luck and let us know how things work out!|`|FfGHHhqBaa	i had the same thing at 34 weeks and my daughter was born at 40w and 4d i was taking a walk with my hubby when she turned and it was so uncomfortable i made him go get the car lol|`|ZcFchrkhaa	I had pressure from about 32 weeks, its normal, it could be just the way the baby is lying
66bc4129385331039e67c99220c312fcaa	continue babysitting and wait to have your own. Babysitting maybe nice, but when its your baby you dont get to "return" the baby at the end of the day. 15 is way too young. I'm 30 and pregnant with my first and wouldnt have wanted to do it any sooner.|`|rHufcHwHaa	It's natural to want a baby.  However, it's NOT the same as babysitting.  What you can do is wait until you're an adult and are emotionally and financially capable of taking care of a child.  You're only 15--you really can't support a baby, and you'll be giving up some important years if you don't wait.|`|QvhPJAKyaa	well to be honest, i want a babч too and im чour age. but чou just gotaa think, that it can wait. no mater how much чou want one, there are more important things right now, like school. sounds sillч i know lol, but do чou want to be worrчing about a babч through all чour gcse exams, and ending up failing and ending up with a crap job? because thats what will happen, чou will have to have no social life anчmore, and its alot to afford (trust me, i have to learn about this, i take child development as one of mч options). so if i was чou, just wait til college is over, once чou have a good career ahead of чou and then consider having a babч.x|`|HSUfe3m7aa	You are looking for unconditional love is all. But you would absolutely mess up your life having a child right now. You have so much time to become a Mom. I have 2 kids at 30, and even I didn't get to do everything I wanted before having them.<br>  <br>  Kids are hard enough even when you are married with jobs and a house. You'd be stacking the odds against your child by having them this early with a boyfriend. <br>  <br>  Your future child deserves the best you can possibly give it, which includes a Daddy who loves it's Mommy enough to be with her forever, a job to support the child and everything they want to do, and a stable comfortable house to grow up in. Not only does your child deserve that, so do YOU honey.<br>  <br>  Take your time :)|`|3X0t8JrXaa	You're in love with the concept I think.  It's not really something you want to do right now.  Not that you CAN'T do it, it would just be extrememly hard.  Its hard at any age but as a teen mom it would be harder.  I think for now you two should continue babysitting and maybe volunteering somewhere like a daycare or even a hospital.  Help some babies who need some love right now.|`|eS4CSdQ5aa	you are a female. motherly instincts kick in...<br>  but you are not financially ready...nor emotionally<br>  <br>  it is one thing to watch a child that is not yours for a few hrs and another to be around a child 24/7<br>  <br>  please wait until you have an education, career, and home|`|wzXJOSIeaa	It's normal for you to go through that stage. Just get a cute little puppy instead. I think it would help out with that A LOT.|`|eU5Eth2aaa	I think the best thing to do would be to keep baby sitting!  Alot of times it's easy to dream about having a picture perfect family with the person you love, but the truth is, there are so many responsibilities that are involved with carrying a child for 9 months and then caring for it for 18 years.  At 15 your body is not ready to have a baby.  You are still growing physically and mentally and so is your boyfriend.<br>  <br>  If you both enjoy being around kids, then keep baby sitting or maybe the two of your could volunteer at a local boys and girls club or something like that!<br>  <br>  Remember...If having a baby sounds like a great idea now, then it will still be a good idea 5 or 6 years down the road when you two are better prepared!|`|5kK2f9Utaa	I think its pretty normal. I've wanted kids since I can remember and still go through spurts where I would want nothing more than to get pregnant and having a little baby to care for. Of course, I realize I still have plenty of years ahead of me and my partying years haven't "officially" started yet (I'll be 21 at the end of April). If you like kids you could pick up more babysitting jobs and maybe even go to school to become a teacher (like me!). I'm the oldest of 23 cousins so I have a large family with even more babies joining in every year!! It's fun but trust me, its even more fun when you can give them back. Enjoy your teenage years, high school, college, traveling!! Babies can wait for a time when you have the money and time to give your full attention to a human being. <br>  <br>  It's still normal though :)|`|29338c6aab7b8f59e90afeef2835b86baa	Please wait. YOu are too young. YOu will end up getting pregnant and then your boyfriend will eventually leave you and you'll be a single mom. YOur child won't have both parents. Look at the world: too many single parents out there.<br>  <br>  Just wait until you are sure that you love your boyfriend so much that you want to spend the rest of your life with him. Then get married, and when you are financially stable, try for a baby.<br>  <br>  The world does not need an other teen mom.<br>  <br>  Please take this free advice. Grow up first, then plan for a stable life and give your future children a happy life with both parents. Good luck|`|sVPToYvKaa	You really need to wait!<br>  <br>  At 15 and 17, you guys cannot fully provide and care for the baby financially and mentally. <br>  <br>  & you don't want your baby to suffer because you were only thinking of the cute little being and not the other things, right?<br>  <br>  Graduate High School, Get a good job, college.<br>  <br>  Then, have a baby.<br>  <br>  Babysit a lot if you like kids.<br>  :)<br>  <br>  Having your own baby is different though, but NO you aren't weird, this is natural.|`|BKbEE9qZaa	Party first !! enjoy being a retarded highschool student!! Because after you become a parent, you cannot make mistakes.|`|Fsr2Rofzaa	Why do i want a baby so young?<br>   Well chances are you didn't have the best childhood|`|bYUdtQZsaa	You probably feel as though he is the perfect guy and he loves kids and you want to be a mom. That's fine. It's okay to feel that way. But my advice is to wait. Wait until you have plenty of money saved up and can do it all by yourself. Wait until you can actually support a baby on your own. When you can pay the thousands for formula, clothes, furniture, and diapers, you're ready, And have a place first too. Have an apartment. Be ready. That way your baby doesn't go without and you don't struggle. It will cause bad feelings later. When you get older and have something sincerely stable, you'll feel better about the process. And if you've been together for a longer time, you will probably actually stay together. Most young couples can't stay together. Too much real life stress they didn't expect. Trust me. I'm seventeen and about to deliver my first baby. I'm being honest with you. If you wait, you will not have any feelings like you did the wrong thing and you won't regret anything.|`|vCq3dR40aa	Thank you for thinking about this before you decide to get pregnant.  It shows you are very intellegent and thoughtful.  Certainly not weird.  <br>  <br>   I have an idea which will benefit you and many babies in need of love.  You can start right away.  <br>  <br>  Why do you want a baby so young?<br>  Because babies are cute and cuddly and they can make nice noises.  They pay attention when you talk to them and think you are the most important thing in their life.  <br>  When you babysit, you put a lot of energy into entertaining baby.  Becuause if this, baby tends to be content and doesn't cry as much as they might at other times.  <br>  <br>  What can you do about it?<br>  I have an idea you could try.  At the same time, you are providing love all babies need at a time they need it most.  Perhaps this could be an outlet for you until you are ready to have one of your own.<br>  <br>  Ask to volunteer at a hospital, berthing clinic, an orphanage with babies or a daycare if the others don't work.  Not for a few hours, but for a whole weeekend.  Perhaps pick a baby or two and do all care for that/those babies for the entire time.  Change all their diapers, feed them, hold them when they cry, get up with them all night long.  Even if you can't pick them up, touch their skin so they know they are loved.  <br>  <br>  I know this is only a weekend.  In the summer or spring break, you could do it for a longer stretch.<br>  <br>  As an ongoing idea, perhaps go for a few hours a week to get your dose of baby loving in.  The babies will benefit and you will too.<br>  <br>  I have a friend who had her first baby at 16.  She managed to get her GED before the baby was born, but she really regrets that she didn't wait until she was older because after the baby was born, she had to work a lot which ment she didn't have the energy to care for her baby like she wanted to.  She also ended up leaving her baby at a childcare that was overcrowded so her baby ended up crying a lot.<br>  <br>  Imagine leaving your baby in someone elses care when he/she is crying and knowing that person has 4 babies to care for and yours will be layed down and might cry for a while with no one to comfort him.  Now do this every day.<br>  <br>  When you babysat, all you and your boyfriend had to do was to take care of the baby.  If you have your own baby, the boyfriend has to go to work, perhaps you have to go to work or school too.  You will do most of the baby care by yourself.  Even if you are still living at home and have help this is a difficult task.<br>  <br>  In your off hours, you will do all the baby care, house cleaning, cooking, and even sleeping.  Your baby will need to eat 10-12 or more times per day and their favorite times are between midnight and 5 am.<br>  <br>  I know you already know this, but your parents could help you work out some of your feelings.<br>  <br>  I wish the best for you.  I pray you will love all the babies that need love today and when the time is right, pass that love on to your own baby.|`|9cpwsrJiaa	You are definetly to young to have a child. I assume you are still in school and there is no way that you would have the time to focus on your education, have a stable job to provide financially for a baby, and balance it all and still have time to raise your baby.<br>  <br>  Plus, you are only 15! I'm 21 years old and pregnant with my first child and although I would not trade ANYTHING in this world for my baby, there are a lot of things I wish I had had time to do before I got pregnant. Your boyfriend is 17 years old and 17 year old boys that want babies or will actually stay around to raise them are few and far between. I seriously think that if you got pregnant right now you would end up regretting it very much. <br>  <br>  Enjoy your babysitting job. Play with babies and love them and nuture them like they were your own, but be glad at the end of the day you can give them back to their parents.|`|eLKkvaCKaa	this recently happened to someone I know, 16 and her boyfriend 18.  she wanted one so bad and she talked to her boyfriend about it and he agreed.  Then she got pregnant and he freaked out and ditched her. <br>  Not saying this will happen to you, but you are so young... Things change, and you boyfriend might not stick around. Then you become a single, young mother, and finding another boyfriend is not going to be easy.<br>  <br>    As someone suggested, get a puppy...   Wait until your at least out of highschool to make such a huge choice!  Even then....The smart thing to do is wait until you own a house , have a good job, and are married.  <br>  Trust me, having a baby will change you life drastically.  You won't be able to live life the way you should be, like your friends and other people your age.  You'll have a huge responsibility, a baby to take care of.  Not an easy thing to do.... chances are you are going to regret having a baby so early.<br>  <br>  <br>  (I'm 20, and been married for almost 2 years... I know how hard it is to raise a baby because I was there when my sister had her first boy at 16.  My husband and I are waiting to have a baby until we own a house and both have good jobs. We want are baby to grow up in the best surroundings.  My mom was also a single mother from the time i was 3 and still is.  I want my kids to have a different life.|`|5cfrig5Eaa	believe me honey you don't want a baby at 15 you got your whole life a head of you enjoy it why you can you got school and i even bet you go to the mall with your friends well if you have a baby guess who is going to be sitting at home on saturday why her friends are at the mall you  as for your boyfriend he will be with his friends too why you are at home with the baby|`|xWYKqcDjaa	Im 16, i feel like that all the time. my boyfriends 18 and he loves talking about it with me. But I would never act out upon it. Not for a long time, anyway. But its still fun to think and talk about :)<br>  <br>  Whenever I feel like that I just talk to him about what our baby would look like, and talk about baby names, stuff like that. I dont think its weird. I would be scared to death if I was pregnant now, even though im excited as anything to be pregnant one day.<br>  <br>  If that makes any sense at all... lol. But yes, your normal. :)

Have they shared their financial info with you.  They may have expenses that you know nothing about.  It is expensive to put a teenage driver on your insurance.  Especially if you have an accident or two, or speeding tickets on your record.  If you have one of the former, don't even try getting insurance for three years from the date of the accident.  That is how long those things stay on your record.  If you try, you will find out that your insurance is cost prohibitive.|`|MzjbUX5eaa	I think you should present it to them as a young, responsible adult. Have a plan layed out. Write it down and chart it. This will let them know you are serious and responsible. Tell them what they can expect of you and what you would like out of them. Try to have some interviews set up prior to the conversation. Know approximately how much you will be potentially earning and tell them how much of that you are willing to put towards your vehicle or insurance for their car and stick to it. Don't disappoint. Insurance on a teenager is expensive! Trust me...|`|kyUiaDgyaa	When I was your age, a long time ago My Mother and Father didn't buy me my first car, I did and that was from money that I had earned and saved up you have got to learn and understand that money does not grow on trees and if you listen to the words and lyrics to Pink Floyd's "Money" I,m pretty certain that you will  understand why|`|vyfrNxeOaa	hi maybe you should stop being so good to them, and they will appreciate you more.<br>  Maybe its time you think about yourself for a change.|`|62hGVNhoaa	Maybe they can't afford to put you on the insurance for their car, at 17 you have just passed your test, the insurance premiums will be steep.|`|prqrQcd1aa	Times are hard now days, everyone is cutting back their spending.

U7JdRVTkaa	I have a baby k'tan sling that I purchased from target. I love it and so does my baby. You can use the sling in several different ways as the child gets older. I was given a baby bjorn and the sling is much better. <br>  <br>  This is the link to the website that will tell you where you can buy it:<br>  <a href="http://www.babyktan.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.babyktan.com/</a><br>  <br>  This is the link to the web page that tells you how to use them:<br>  <a href="http://babyktanvideo.com/" rel="nofollow">http://babyktanvideo.com/</a>|`|RxhBUkwSaa	Wearing your baby is a fantastic idea.  Good for the baby, and good for you.  <br>  <br>  Nearly all slings have a learning curve.  Try to get it before the baby comes so you can fool around with how to use it.  <br>  <br>  I've used a Hotsling, and I like them, but what I don't like is the size thing!  And, they are fairly expensive.  Some slings are adjustable so you and your husband can both use just one.  A very popular and well thought of one is the Over The Shoulder Baby Holder (OTSBH).<br>  <br>  Here are some slings, and sling sites, that come highly recommended:<br>  OTSBH is still one of the best:  <a href="http://babyholder.com/" rel="nofollow">http://babyholder.com/</a><br>  Heart to Heart:  <a href="http://www.heart2heart.ca/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.heart2heart.ca/index.html</a><br>  Ultimate Baby Wrap:  <a href="http://www.parentsofinvention.com/ubw-product.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.parentsofinvention.com/ubw-pr...</a><br>  Kangaroo Korner - wide variety of styles:  <a href="http://www.kangarookorner.com/choosing.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.kangarookorner.com/choosing.a...</a><br>  Peppermint - site with a wide variety of styles & brands:  <a href="http://peppermint.com" rel="nofollow">http://peppermint.com</a> <br>  <br>  If you're willing to learn the wrapping techniques, the wrap slings like Ultimate Baby Wrap are really great.  eBay is also a good place to buy.  Many slings are available there, for a fraction of their retail price.|`|4sRhrdyUaa	Pouches such as Hotslings are one of the easiest baby carriers to use. There is a little learning curve with getting a newborn into a pouch, but my daughter was quite happy in her Hotsling.<br>  <br>  Sizing can be a little confusing, but I know at La Stella Blu you can get help finding the right size.|`|lZx1g1uCaa	you can check out thebabywearer.com for a lot of info on the different carriers|`|ANHsv4ENaa	I really recommend an adjustable sling. They are so much easier to use than ones that are a set size. I have a ring sling and a Sleepy Wrap and I love both of them. For a new baby the Sleepy Wrap was great and still is for when I vacuum or we go on long walks. The sling is nice because I can so easily take him in and out like when we are shopping and he wants to be held then put in the cart.|`|vKEYa8aeaa	i have a hotsling and i like it, im 5 foot 9 and weighed 135 pounds before i got pregnant, i ordered a size 2 and it fits

Might be hard to avoid those other teeth! new teeth will feel sharp through the gums.<br>  <br>  If neither of these "tests" came up positive I would probably give his dr a call, just to be on the safe side.|`|1PLYMAR6aa	I find that motrin works better for my little one then tylenol when she is teething, since it has more anti-inflammatory properties.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|ca0db37cc242f17eb06d3e3e4612fb74aa	This is perfectly normal.  Lack of sleep for you, crying/fussing for them.<br>  <br>  Slight fever and lots of drooling is what happens during teething.<br>  <br>  I'd suggest going to a local Walgreens or pharmacy and asking for some teething tablets.|`|nwWBddEnaa	Ashton's and parsons teething powder has been the only thing to settle my wee one this past week, i wish you all the best x
2674548b6a4c9cdbb098044c58c7af7aaa	Lots of mixed babies have blondish colored hair.  <br>  And blue eyes.<br>  And light colored skin.<br>  Etc. etc. etc.<br>  Remember the baby is half white too, so it's possible for the baby to look white.|`|72SrLDQ3aa	Yeah, but the chances are very small.<br>  I remember reading an article awhile ago about two sets of twins born to an interracial couple, and with both sets, one twin was white with blonde hair, and the other twin was black with dark hair.|`|X9Dpyrg9aa	I wouldn't think so. Blonde is recessive, so unless one of your black ancestors had blonde hair it's not likely. Light brown I would think is possible, or maybe blond highlights.|`|qYNCV6L1aa	my son's father is black and i'm white and blonde but red hair runs in the family from past generations, my grandfather. my son, who's 4.5 months old has very straight, light brown hair but the red in it is obvious especially in sunlight. so it could go either way. depends on who's genes are strongest. i've seen black children with black parents with almost blonde hair. that's the beauty of mixed and ethnic children, they are so diverse and have so many features to pull from and they always pull the best traits of both parents and past generations :)|`|7IHMjy2caa	I don't know how probable it is, but it is possible. My cousin is biracial. Her father is black and her mother (my aunt) is blonde hair blue eyes. My cousin was blonde (granted a darker honey blonde, but still blonde) up until her teen years. She is 16 now and her natural color is brown, though she has taken to dying it pink.|`|IuJjYz6gaa	Yes, I don't think it has a lot to do with the skin color of the parents, but the hair color<br>  <br>  Dark hair is more dominent than blonde hair.<br>  <br>  My husband has dark hair, I have blonde, our daughter has blonde, and our son has white blonde hair.|`|LpqLHa5maa	YES IT IS POSSIBLE. I have two kids by a black man the oldest is black with brown hair. My youngest is white with blonde hair and blue eyes. Both of my kids have the same dad. <br>  P.S.   I am a white female with blonde hair and brown eyes|`|wEc3XzExaa	yes, but unlikely. Brown eyes and hair are dominant genes. My husbands mexican and I am white. My daughter is blond, green eyes and my son is redheaded green eyes. So it can happen.|`|vEv2YwWdaa	Ofcourse.  The mothers and fathers genes combine to determine the color of the babies hair.
JdyRdLwVaa	I got that its called implantation bleeding..I thought at first I was starting my period but then after 5 minutes it went away..the next day I took a hpt and it came out positive I was almost 4 weeks pregnant then.|`|s4OtfZ7Gaa	yes. i am pregnant and i bleed every few days. i have a sub chorionic hematoma, where the placenta is detaching from my uterus causing a hemorrhage. <br>  it could also be implantation bleeding. this is bleeding caused by the baby implanting into your uterus causing slight bleeding.<br>  brown discharge is usually old blood|`|BGcVEjfGaa	old blood.  Lots of women spot during their pregnancy.  Did you go to a doctor and have it validated that you were pregnant?  Sometimes there are false positives.<br>  If you are for sure pregnant, then the spotting could be normal.  If you are having cramps or the blood starts to be more red, go to the dr. immediately because it could be a miscarriage.|`|eS4CSdQ5aa	implantation bleeding ... brown discharge is normal.

My son didn't cut any teeth until he was 8 months. He has 4 teeth two on top and two on the bottom at 9 months. Don't worry they'll be in soon - often when you're not looking. I thought my baby had only two teeth about two weeks ago until I was fishing around his mouth for some wadded up paper that he'd gotten ahold of.

She hasn't had anymore since then though I can see her gums are starting to raise a little again.|`|6VbNJOtfaa	My son had 5 (4 on bottom, 1 on top).

tQsxsuNPaa	Being overweight is hardly a factor in birth control!  Nor is smoking...both my parents smoked when they were teenagers, and continued waaaaaaaay into their 50s!  Somehow, they managed to conceive 5 of us!  <br>  <br>  For him...he should quit smoking.  For a gazillion reasons.  He knows what they are, and so do you.<br>  <br>  For you...you should probably try to lose the weight.  Again, you know all the reasons.  But here's something you might NOT know....and this WILL affect your ability to get pregnant.  If you have been fighting your weight all your life.  If you have any of the other symptoms of PCOS...facial hair, irregular periods, etc.  I'm sure you can check online...try Webmd...you might have trouble conceiving because you don't ovulate regularly.  When you ARE ready...and if it doesn't happen quickly...have your doctor refer you to an endocrinologist or a fertility specialist!  It's not complicated for most people, but it might be necessary to know.<br>  <br>  Oh, and don't crash diet when you are trying to get pregnant.  It tells your body that you are in famine, and you are less likely to conceive.|`|90zcKChJaa	Yes, it does. If you eat a healthy diet, then your overall health will increase and fertility will therefor increase also.<br>  <br>  Start taking prenatal vitamins now. Drink LOTS of water, go for a walk everyday. Eat asparagus (high in folic acid), fruits, salads, any and every veggie. Do some research on fertility 'diets' on the web. There is a lot of use full information out there.<br>  <br>  Good luck. ;)
4sRhrdyUaa	The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that children under 2 do not watch any TV.  Research has shown that children under 2 who are not exposed to TV know have a better vocabulary than those who watch TV.  Children  learn best from interaction with others, so the "educational shows" really are not doing much for children under 2.<br>  <br>  It is no surprise that your 9 month old would be drawn to the television.  All of the stimulation is probably too much to turn away from.|`|RxhBUkwSaa	Every baby has his or her own personality.  Like all good and bad things we do, it's a matter of moderation.<br>  <br>  Using the TV as a babysitter so you can do things other than interact with your baby for long periods is a bad thing.  Using the TV as short term distraction or entertainment is a good thing.  <br>  <br>  Don't put labels on your little one.  Everyone else your child's life will do that for you, and it's something to be resisted!|`|MQ1sXYBbaa	I have the TV on all day with my 11 mo old daughter around.  She will turn and look occasionally, but doesn't "watch" tv except when The George Lopez show comes on and the Low Rider song starts.  She is mesmerized by that show opening.  It is pretty funny.|`|AA10769738	I do NOT think a LITTLE Tv is very bad.<br>  Babies can learn from tv sometimes. <br>  But too much Tv can be bad. <br>  I have a 5 month old and when the tv or <br>  radio is on sometimes he tries to look and <br>  it distracts him but my docter said you shouldnt<br>  intrduce babies to tv untill there atleast a year..<br>   Try toys that light up and make different noises.|`|vEv2YwWdaa	Most doctors agree that children should not see Tv until they are 1 year.  Why would you introduce a 9 month old to TV?|`|USrhxMW9aa	My son is 6 months old and loves the TV, too.  Not that I'm plopping him in front of it or anything.  If we're anywhere that there is a TV he automatically turns to it.  I just think that some babies find it fascinating - all the colors, movement, sounds, etc.  I wouldn't be worried, just don't let it become a bad habit into his toddler years...get him outside to play so that he doesn't become lazy.<br>  <br>  Also, I read in a book that I have, that it's important to make sure that your child is able to play imaginatively before they are constantly watching TV programs.  I guess they just figure it may inhibit their ability to occupy themselves without the tv.  Which I suppose would maybe lead to ADD.  Hope this helps<br>  <br>  <br>  Oh and my nephew who is now 12 years old used to watch tv a lot when he was younger and now is in all advanced classes, the top of his class and reads all the time.  So, I guess it doesn't always have a bad effect on a child! :)|`|TRvAhhNKaa	9 months seems a little early to get your kid addicted to TV. I don't think it's even healthy for a baby that young. Sounds like lazy parenting to me.|`|nKXTjqQWaa	It's not like you should only be allowed to watch tv when baby is a sleep so he doesn't notice the tv! Gosh these people saying lazy parenting etc need to be a little more open minded. Lazy parenting would be sitting your child in front of the tv so you could do your thing. <br>  <br>  You could maybe just limit his time in front of it. Turn it off and let your little girl find other things to do for most of the day. I don't think it means something is wrong with her, she just likes it :)|`|0dwVWzLJaa	i have this with my son if i take him to someones house and cartoons are on he doesn't even blink! lol he loves them and he is also 9 months, i let him watch tv in a morning for half an hour n wizz round tidying up and then again in the afternoon i do the same but im sure they will be fine, everyone thinks that if you let children under one watch tv they will turn into bully's and horrible kids with deep seeded issues! i think its being a bit dramatic! lol so as long as its not all day i think its normal xx|`|5UIdcMgIaa	Well, my sister has a kid too, and he loves to watch cartoons there (but he is one year old) .<br>  I don't believe that so harmful, I suggest to ask it to a doctor...<br>  If he watches cartoons from there, it should be OK, because they are good for brain:) Like that I've heard.|`|xZ3rZbshaa	Well, it is bad. Even though it is only education shows. Try getting him out of the house and away from the T.V. You shouldn't let your child watch T.V all the time, cause there's a good chance of his eyesight to drain at an early age. Which isn't good.|`|9eno55hCaa	I let my 7month old watch tv with me for about 45 minutes a day....but we are watching theses "My Baby Can Read" dvds lol<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.yourbabycanread.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.yourbabycanread.com/</a>
2pxiK9waaa	You need to stick to your guns and drop her off. Talk to the teacher and check in throughout the day. You literally walk her in in the morning, drop her off, and tell her when you will be back and leave. Don't prolong it, just leave. If you call in and check on her in a few hours and she's fine, then she's just putting on a show for you. It's completely normal for her to be regressing, and they'll both be sick a lot for the first year or so. The good thing is that she won't be sick as often once she's in kindergarten, which is a great thing! Just make sure to send them whether they want to go or not. Good luck--you are doing the right thing!|`|88cf073c1a10431f8f96825fd98241e8aa	This is a tough one. Talk to the teacher and see if she stops quickly after you leave. She might throw fits to put you on a guilt trip. "How dare you leave me all alone, I will show you". Also when you drop her off and she doesn't throw a fit after you are gone check your own behavior sometimes kids will throw tantrums for their parents because mom or Dad are making the Drop off really long and emotional and its harder for the parents to leave their kid than for the kid to leave their parents. Kids feel that and behave accordingly with not wanting to let you go.Be consistent and make it a quick bye bye - see ya later|`|fNuMoHt7aa	You have to be a tough mother. If she sees that her tantrum will not get her any where see will stop. You cant give in the littlest bit or comfort her at all. Just drop her off and leave. Kids are smart. she know if she throws a tantrum you will stay there longer with her. My 2 year throws tantrums for her mother all the time but not for me. My wife wont listen to me. I guess its a motherly instinct thing she cant get over.
ZusC87WBaa	Even with those in mind, there is no "right time".  There is only the time that is right for you.  Yes, being able to support a baby is necessary, but the rest all come down to what is more important to you.  I figure if I want to travel, I'll do it once my kids are grown.  Fortunately for us, life doesn't come to a standstill at 50.  I had my first child when I was 21 and my last 2 months ago, shortly before turning 36.  I'm happy with doing things that way, but some women wouldn't be.  Do what is right for you and what you think will make you happy.|`|T6OorlmZaa	Lol, there is no "perfect" time to have a baby. If you wait until your circumstances are exactly right, you'll wait forever.<br>  <br>  You could be 30 and rich....but spend your nights in the bar tossing back shots and snorting coke. Being of the right age and financial status doesn't always matter.<br>  <br>  Just make sure you are able to take care of your child. You don't have to be rich. Love goes a long way. Make sure that you are young enough to handle the roller coaster ride, but old enough to know your baby comes first.<br>  <br>  You will know when the time is right for you. Go with your instincts.|`|h6hNQjn5aa	When you are in a serious relationship with a secure roof over your head and financial support.A little bit of life experience could also help i.e. not when you are 15 and still at school!|`|P4LBygv2aa	well I had my first at 28 years old and my second at 40 ,  I really don't think its a question of age so much as maturity and how well you and your partner can provide for the child , I'm not saying you have to be rich , just well off for the child's sake , at 28 I had a full time job and could bring him to work with me , my mom's store , so that was a help , but my son's dad was very immature and thought he only needed to work once in a while , he owns his own business , construction , needless to say that is not how to have a good income , at times we fell short with bills , I left after 9 years and was so much better off , I never realized how much he spent on himself till our bills were separate,he still doesn't pay support as he clams to not have a job which they believe as a doctor said he has bipolar , he does not .then at 35 I met my now husband we both have jobs and he works and saves just as I do , our daughter is now 6 1/2 months I went part time as we figured out that 1/2 my pay would go to daycare anyway, we are able to support 2 kids own a home and 2 cars , so it all has to do with maturity .|`|MvMT8TD3aa	This is going to sound silly but i dont think there is a right time to have children!!

First i was shocked, id been with my partner for about 1 year!! However if i didnt have my daughter we wouldnt have brought a place together nor would i have fallen pregnant for the 2nd time.

1VnWhP1Saa	11.9 is just fine, they only treat when it falls below 10. its normal in pregnancy for it to be a little low like that it's called Gestational Haemodilution. You can naturally up your count by eating iron rich foods such as leafy greens, fortified cereals & lean red meats.|`|h9q1wMbQaa	If something was bad they'd let you know. your HBG is 1/10th off.  That is nothing to worry about in my opinion.  If your glucose test was off, they'd have you go for a 3 hour GTT (glucose tolerance test).  They'd do that as soon as your results came in if it was alarming and probably would set you up with an endocrinologist to monitor your glucose throughout the remainder of your pregnancy and a week or so after birth.<br>  <br>  If you are taking prenatal vitamins, iron shouldn't be an issue.  Lots of people don't take them though because they can be constipating.  You can get iron from other sources, greens, red meat, cereals, and flinstone vitamins (for the people who refuse to swallow a horse pill.  lol)<br>  <br>  Everything sounds good though so try not to worry!<br>  <br>  Have a happy pregnancy|`|FmSWPS7Paa	if your doctor is concerned im pretty sure he'll let you know. other wise its nothing|`|0vpDDM8aaa	i failed my glucose test....so they sent me to the hospital to do a second test (a 3 hour one this time... :o/) and i passed it fine.  who knows.
hVVALFAPaa	You stretched something that has already been stretched quite a bit. There are a lot of ligaments that are trying to hold your uterus in place. This was very easy when your uterus was the size of your fist, but now that it is the size of a watermelon, it is a bit more difficult. They can cramp up when a bit of extra stress is on them (like stretching in bed.)<br>  <br>  No harm done. This is normal and may happen again if you move fast or stretch again. As long as the pain hits, then fades relatively quickly, you and baby are fine.|`|7rIAd6gGaa	It sounds like what I get every time I move in bed at night lately. It really does feel like a charlie horse but in the lower part of my stomach. It hurts sooooo bad. It's just a muscle - nothing to worry about - but it hurts like hell. Hopefully that was your only one!! I've had a ton already and I'm 2 weeks behind you. Ugh.|`|CugCzH9iaa	If it does not still hurt then you did not pull a muscle.  When you pull a muscle it will hurt/be sore for at least a couple days.  You could have had a contracion or a Braxton Hicks (fake contraction).|`|PLgNsOF9aa	Maybe you had a contraction. Or maybe you just stretched and your already stretched out inner belly muscles just pulled too tight.|`|Rhr1umV1aa	I am 34 weeks pregnant and when I stretch too far to one side or move a way that my body is not use to while being pregnant I get this pain as well. It is just a muscle. My doctor tells me that it is the ligaments being stretched. I don't think that it is anything to worry about. If it doesn't go away then call your doctor next time.|`|xLSb3XgCaa	inwould have to say your baby is growing but go to the doctor to make sure there is nothing wrong with the abilical courd|`|FYDw1rjlaa	I'm not sure about the muscle part but you should not get up from bed too quickly.|`|1hciyvKdaa	Sounds like you got a charley horse in that area.

wqL84O8Naa	you're not pregnant, you just had an "off' cycle|`|46cd2ca02c07674e58e26d9c11367762aa	I really think that you need to adventure to your nearest dollar store or pharmacy and pick up a test. <br>  Sounds to me the tiny tinge of blood you had on Feb. 28th might be implantaton spotting. Its normal for you to have bleeding after sex during pregnancy, because the cervix becomes VERY sensitive.<br>  You probably dont need to wait until the 18th to find out, Im sure an HPT would be accurate by now. Good luck.|`|5X6C4s7zaa	The only way to get an answer to this is to take a pregnancy test.  I know you are probably nervous to do it but whatever is done is done, now you just need to find out whether you are pregnant or not and move on from their.  Good Luck!|`|91jTS7Epaa	I highly recommend that you take a home pregnancy test.  It will ease your mind to have a more final answer, and if it's positive, get you started on your next healthy pregnancy.  Good luck.|`|qfgQDPIRaa	Your right, I do take these questions.  Please have some common sense and take a test or see a doctor, I mean seriously, what else were you planning on figuring out?|`|v3LnJycKaa	take a test.

Fh4B88ZGaa	It takes the egg anywhere from 5-7 days to implant- so it is not likely that she is pregnant. She'll have to wait two weeks before she can take a test, so she is going to have to wait it out. Lesson learned: use protection every time.|`|j7fzuDxgaa	take a test just to be sure. its to late for the morning after pill it has to be taken within 36 hours of having sex.|`|uaIUBYTcaa	This could be a sign she is pregnant. If she doesn't have her full period in a few days tell her to get to a doctor. I know when I had sex a few days before my period I spotted a few days before my period. It was like 4 days after I had intercourse but it didn't scare me because I used protection. <br>  <br>  Always use protection it lowers the risk factor of pregnancy and STD's. Tell your friend not to gamble with her future.|`|080934e29f274b8260654d8ae8456f65aa	She mostly likely spotting.  However, it is important to know if she is on some form of a contraceptive.  The fact that she had sex 4 days ago is definitely something to consider, however that time frame is too soon to tell.  If you friend's period doesn't come by say next Wed, then I recommend her to visit her Dr.  They will test her for pregnancy, amongst other female reproductive things.<br>  <br>  *HTH*|`|mQ8e5jZnaa	if her periods are usually normal, chances are she is pregnant.

dn2UCOkqaa	She wouldn't. Why would any woman want to kill something that was apart of her? Something so wonderful and precious. It's a miracle she had that many. I hope someone else has 8 babies inside of them and can make the decision of selecting a few to KILL like she was given that choice. Why would anyone do that. How can you have a straight face and not cry when you kill one of your own? God gave her these children,if he wanted her to lose any of them, all 8 of them wouldn't be born.<br>  <br>  EDIT- I am proud that I see at least one guy that cares about the life of an innocent child. Thank you Mark M! =)|`|abT0o6hHaa	I just don't understand how killing a human could EVER be a choice. Why should a woman or anyone for that matter, have the right to kill someone? I'm about to have my second baby, and to be honest, when I first found out, I was devastated and I didn't want the baby. But it was my fault that I became pregnant. The baby didn't ask for it. Why does he deserve to be killed? As for this octo mom, it was her choice to get pregnant with 8. She is a crazy as hell  if you ask me|`|XhIYAH6Laa	so tired of hearing about this lady! She was naive and selfish to do what she did....abortion isn't even a question in this situation....she chose to have that many implanted...I really wish people would stop talking about her!|`|n8vBnA9Iaa	No matter how many babies a woman is carrying, abortion should still be illegal. I am very pro life. But I guess to pro choicers and to abortionists, abortions are just like a farmer cutting off a chicken's head. Its disgusting how normal and accepted abortion is these days.<br>  I think Octo mom is completely irresponsible, immature and should not be able to take home her 8 children. But what about the doctor that performed the insemination? He should get a lot of attention too. Or now the guy who gave the sperm was on this talk show and wants something to do with it. More like he is just after any money if there is any because of this. Now if it had only been 1 baby, would that guy have even spoke up?<br>  I hope that she won't get her babies. I hope that this will be a lesson and that she should be tied because of this.|`|Fsr2Rofzaa	I don't see what the two have to do with the other.  The people at your work need to find a better talking point on being Pro-Choice.  On a side note, those that are referring to God in this sound just as crazy as the OctoMom herself.  God had NOTHING to do with these babies.  If GOD had it his way, she would be a CHILDLESS woman whom would have to adopt to have a child.  Don't twist GOD, with beakers and a syringe!!|`|BU3A3rR4aa	who cares<br>  <br>  i dont care about the Octo mom honestly and no one else does either. yeah abortion is killing i know that.|`|yZkf3zFeaa	I don't see how it would really be a reason to say it should stay legalized.<br>  <br>  Women who are carrying more than I think 4 fetuses at once I believe, are given the opportunity to carry fewer because of health risks and it can make it so that the others can survive.<br>  <br>  Lots of people care. Though I believe in a woman's right to choose, I don't think abortion should be used as a form of birth control, i.e being careless and going through more than one because you are a whore, yes I have actually met and worked with people who have had over 15. There are always other options, but for some people its the only way.|`|KOwzDLPdaa	Generally they implant multiples because only one or two actually embed in the uterus. She had all 8 embed and they gave her the choice of sacrificing a few for the benefit of the others. The fewer babies she carried would have increased the birth weight of the others and lessened their chances of having special needs. It is different then abortion as a form of birth control.<br>  <br>  But seriously, the doctor was insane not to throw her out on the street for requesting the procedure in the first place with 6 kids already being fed on food stamps!|`|PmhaLLp7aa	Why do pro-life (extremely against abortion) say "the doctors advice was to abort some of the babies" They say that because they are pissed off and totally contradicting their beliefs. I am pro-choice, I personally could not choice which baby to abort and which babies to keep. I think people need to just leave this lady alone, she may have a few screws loose but I know tons more that have raised kids wackier then this braud. My mother being one of them, she didnt even take care of her kids like this lady does and no one took us away. She is raising 6 kids and all are alive and doing well. Do I agree with her taking advantage of help, no. I feel you shouldnt try to have a child unless you can take care of it on your own without government assistance. That is for people who didnt intend on getting pregnant and truly need the help.|`|Y3DR1EBUaa	Haveing more than one baby can be dangerous..<br>  no one likes her bc she had 8 at the same time & had 6 kids, <br>  i personally agree that IF i would get pregnant with 8 I would not abort if i had 12 kids... god will give u wat he wants u to have<br>  <br>  she may have chose to have this many implanted but she did not KNOW they would all 6 become a baby & 2 became twins.. she took a risk & she will be the one to suffer the consecuences... If god didnot want these 8 babies on earth they would have died in utero or never been formed|`|Pdn4sAKHaa	people say that because they think she shouldnt have had more......but that was her choice|`|T9fek24eaa	I am pro-choice, but I also came face to face with this sort of situation when I found out about a month ago that I was pregnant with triplets. Carrying more than ONE baby at a time is always more risky and the more you carry, the more risky is becomes. At first I was scared and all I could think of is the health of these 3 babies growing inside of me BUT when asked the question if I would reduce it was always and never was going to be anything other than no, that is MY choice. <br>  <br>  BUT I do believe its a womans right to make this choice for herself. If I had 8 babies I would definitely have to put more consideration into it, not because I did not love all 8 of them, but because all 8 of those babies are in great danger. She is the exception to alot of rules in the sense that her pregnancy lasted till 31 weeks and all 8 babies were born alive and are STILL alive, but that is not also to say that all 8 of these babies are not going to have alot of problems as they get older too because they were so small at birth. The fact of the matter is she should have never had 6 embryos implanted into her just for these reasons. Ideally you should NEVER try to become pregnant with more than one baby at a time and doctors know that. Its not a "more for your money" type of situation. Its a situation of is keeping all 8 of these babies going to end all 8 of their life or would it be better to terminate 4 or 5 of them and give the remaining babies the best chance I can. Thats a personal decision and not to be decided by anyone else than the person in the situation. <br>  <br>  THAT is why...
gu1sEQN8aa	I like brainstorming too :) i love Tucker, Jasper, and Zeke, Westbrook is kinda interesting but you know its a lil off the wall lol.  I love all the girls names, especially Cosette, Reason is really really cool I've never heard that!  My fav one is Kylie i think.|`|tSEA42Uraa	Wills: What? This isn't even a name. Try William.<br>  <br>  Storey: This is horrible! Ugh. It's not a real name.<br>  <br>  Tucker: I dislike this as well. He won't be a little boy forever, and this name certainly doesn't suit anyone over nine.<br>  <br>  Jasper: I don't like it either way, and the fact that it's a Twilight name makes it even worse.<br>  <br>  Westbrook: Okay, this is getting out of hand. This sounds like the name of a street: Westbrook Lane. Go with Brook(e) if you must.<br>  <br>  Zeke: I don't like it. It's a nickname, not a full name. Try Zachary, and call him Zack. It's close enough.<br>  <br>  Magdalena: This one isn't half bad! I actually like it. I love the nicknames Maggie and Lena.<br>  <br>  Cosette: This is what my mother wanted to name me! Off of the little girl is Les Miserables. However, that doesn't mean I like it. It's iffy.<br>  <br>  Liah: How would you pronounce it? Like Leah? If so, go with Leah. Is it pronounced like Liar without an R? If so, it's a horrible name in and of itself. (Think: "Liah, Liah, pants on fire!")<br>  <br>  Marilyn: I do like this name, but as a nickname. Try Mary-Lynn, or Marie-Lynn, and call her Marilyn.<br>  <br>  Esme: Bad name, and Twilight makes it worse.<br>  <br>  Reason: SO not a name. *Shudders*<br>  <br>  Dakota: It's over-done. I don't like it anymore.<br>  <br>  Delilah: Better on a child than adult, but it's pretty.<br>  <br>  Kylie: An adult with this name?

ybexjS2Paa	Go for it, it's for toddlers so I don't think they would be doing anything harmful there. My 14month old daughter loves kicking ball around. I'm sure she will enjoy it and you are right you are giving her a chance for social activity.|`|ZusC87WBaa	Nope, sorry.  The youngest any of my kids started playing was 5 and even that is a little young to me.  Before that they are not going to understand the rules at all and are not really coordinated enough to run and play the game.

K0yRqrGCaa	I thought that was a myth until i went into labor on the night of a full moon. My doctor and i tried everything to induce my labor. He stretched my cervix twice, i walked miles and did all the natural ways to induce but nothing would work. i was 3-4 cm dialated 80% effaced for 2 weeks!! When i full moon came i went into labor!|`|Cah6nfV5aa	I think my daughter was.|`|f4zg7LHLaa	don't pin your hopes on it! lol! i did! i was near the end of my pregnancy, and there was a full moon, and got all excited. no such luck!<br>  i think it is something to do with the gravity pull, or tides or something like that!|`|hVVALFAPaa	I have heard that more women go into labor on a full moon because the gravity pull of the moon is greater then. The increased gravity can cause labor. <br>  <br>  I don't know how true it is, but that is what I read once.
wb9BBKzRaa	Because it was only 2 days late, I don't think you had enough time to ovulate. If you were a week late then yes, it is POSSIBLE to get pregnant.<br>  With that said, it's more difficult to get pregnant within your first few months of stopping the patch or the pill. I'm not saying it can't happen, but your body usually needs some time to get back into the swing of things.<br>  <br>  You should be fine.|`|oeCIzoF9aa	no cause I'm a guy!|`|nuBRcuwvaa	I used the patch for awhile until I learned about a ton of negative and potentially long term side effects.<br>  <br>  Sorry to not answer your question, but if you google it, you'll probably learn more than you want.<br>  <br>  I stopped using it and went back to normal BC right away.|`|ntef2sPMaa	no but since you forgot and had to put it on two days later, now you have to remember the next week to put it on the day you put it back on. i wear it and i forgot to put it on once before. but lucky i didnt have sex without it. be careful .|`|d3jtRA8caa	As unlikely as it is, I got pregnant on the Ortho Evra Patch. If you do get pregnant tell your doctor right away. They will have to check and make sure there is nothing wrong.|`|VJqDtuoPaa	Find a better birth contol I've heard bad things about the Patch and the ring. although the pill is SOOOO annoying its safer than both of these methods.
SEzIkGNiaa	I think its a bad idea.  As for punishments, there are many other ways to punish a child instead of locking them in their room.  What does that teach them anyway?  <br>  As for staying in their room overnight, what happens if they need to go to the bathroom?  Or if they need you incase of emergencies?<br>  <br>  How about you keep a gate at the top of the stairs so she can get down, and put a top lock on extra rooms, bathrooms, ect...|`|ANHsv4ENaa	That question really disturbs me. Locking them in their room? Isn't that somewhat archaic? Not to mention cruel. What if she has a nightmare and wants to come to you? What on earth would it teach your child to be locked in their room as punishment? To hate their room? That's a valuable lesson? I would never, ever consider locking my son in his room for any reason. If I were that concerned about him walking around at night I'd get locks for the other doors and put them out of his reach. Don't lock her in her room.|`|Qfq4lpe7aa	I wouldn't lock my son in his room if you are worried about her roaming the house I would get a baby gate...|`|bO2rzfISaa	Try a baby gate in the doorway. I had one child I had to lock in her room at night for safety after I peeled her off of a nine foot shelf in a room with tiled floors.<br>  <br>  People don't agree with it but it was a safety issue.<br>  <br>  I don't think a child should ever be locked in a room as punishment.|`|XkHiFJMKaa	I lock  my 3 year old in if she keeps coming out of here room. as soon as she is  asleep i unlock it though|`|AjqO1aJgaa	I did it for about a week when we first put my son in a real bed. Otherwise he came downstairs over and over, full of joy that he'd escaped - and was then really distressed and hysterical when we took him right back up to bed. When the door was locked, we heard the rattle and went up there and put him back in bed - but he never got distressed since he never got to the point of thinking he'd got away with it.<br>  <br>  Once he'd gone to sleep (anything up to 10-12 attempts initially, and up to an hour) we just unlocked the door again. It was easy to tell when he was asleep because we had a baby monitor. And after those first few days he stopped doing it altogether. I've never locked his door again. <br>  <br>  You shouldn't lock your daughter's door when she (and more importantly you) are asleep. If you are worried about her roaming the house, put up a baby gate in the doorway outside the solid door. Once she uses the bathroom you'll need to let her roam at least that far, but you can keep the gate at the top of the stairs so she can't fall down half-asleep.<br>  <br>  I have enforced my kids staying in their rooms for punishment when they behaved really dreadfully (normally hysterical rudeness), but not with a lock. I sat outside and held the handle until they calmed down.|`|iXt3erseaa	I don't recommend it. I believe that it is better to train the child to stay in his/her own room. I have two children who are very good at this - we close the doors, but don't lock them. If they need us at night, we can get in quickly or they can get out quickly - although we dissuade them from leaving their rooms unless it's to use the toilet. We do have stairs and when they were young, we had a gate at the top so they wouldn't go down the stairs accidentally. I don't recommend the use of a lock at all. It is unlikely that she will roam around the house.|`|mDYsr62maa	Don't lock the door, but hook up a very loud alarm that you switch on at night.  It needs to be loud enough to both scare her and that it wakes you up so you can tell her no and put her back into bed.  If that never works, lock her up so she does not hurt herself.  It is not abuse, it is protection.|`|XYBHM8aSaa	I would never lock my children in a room. Actually I never had to.  If they ever did get out of bed it was just to try and crawl into mine.  I always leave all our bedroom doors open at night.  My husband is a very light sleeper and if they even get out of bed and move around he wakes up and checks on them.|`|OTp3JWIqaa	I do not believe in locking your child in their room.<br>  <br>  If you are worried about her wandering the house use a baby gate to keep her in her room.|`|GOUgocyAaa	I think it would be a better idea to get a tall gate to keep them in their room so this way if they needed you they could still call out.|`|fdnbXfvfaa	Personally I think that is disgusting. Get a baby gate if your child is getting out from the room at night.|`|KncPJwIaaa	Just get a regular door and keep it closed kids are gonna be kids man|`|nuBRcuwvaa	I don't see any reason why a child needs to be locked in a room.  We put a baby gate up at the doorway of our 2 year old's room when he was learning to sleep alone... so he wouldn't escape at night and hurt himself.  But the gate allowed him to feel like he was still part of the house, and not shut away from us.<br>  <br>  I would never use this as a disciplinary option either.  What good does that do?  If the child has done something wrong, then it needs to be discussed, not ignored by putting the child in their room.  Or, if the child is that much out of control, then they shouldn't be left alone... they are clearly in need of supervision. <br>  <br>  I don't believe in time outs - so I guess that is part of my problem with this method.  Sure sometimes kids need to sit down if they're too hyperactive and going crazy - but that isn't punishment, it is just to help them take a deep breath.<br>  <br>  So I can't find any reason why it is a good idea.  *Keep the door locked for fire reasons is ok, but you don't need to lock it!*|`|eq59nZJHaa	I put a latch lock on my daughter door only at night from about 1 1/2-3.  She would get out at night and after finding her with the dead bolt unlocked and the door open on her way out at 4am I knew that I had to do something to keep her contained.  I tried other methods such as the door handle bulbs but she knew how to get through them.  I choose a latch lock as it only takes less then a second ot open.|`|VLRZT9Foaa	Do people still do that?  Really, really horrible.  Yes, there IS that whole fire hazard thing and wouldn't that be horrible?  Man, I feel bad for this kid.<br>  <br>  Good luck in a year or two, when they figure out how to open the window and they are crawling out of that instead... Aaah.. but you could always nail those shut, too.|`|2Z00M2Qvaa	instead of locking your child in their room, why don't you get a baby gate and put that in their door. That way you can take it down when you need to and it keeps the child in their room and you can keep an eye on them.|`|BKbEE9qZaa	Don't question the likelihood of fire. These things happen. otherwise, I agree locking your kid up is indeed a stupid idea and undisciplinary.|`|dIJMuCSyaa	I don't think any child should be locked in their room or anywhere else. I think the baby gate like others are saying is a great idea.I think it maybe called child abuse.|`|n6ThOjYWaa	im not a parent i just babysit and most kids dont wander around so its ok aslong as there is no fire|`|T9fek24eaa	Yes we have the lock flipped around so we can lock her door from the outside at night time. I do not use it as a punishment, the only time it is locked is when she goes to bed. At first we could use the door knob covers on the inside of the door and she could not open the door, but she started learning to take them off and then she would get out. <br>  <br>  When she got out the first time, it was in middle of the night, she pulled a chair up to the counter in the kitchen, got a knife from the drawer and the block of velveeta cheese from the fridge and was trying to cut her a piece of cheese. THEN she let our dog out the back door (we have a fenced in back yard thankfully.) She had full reign of the house and thank god she did not get hurt. Also one of my friends son's got out of his room when he was about 2 yrs old then got out the front door. Thankfully they live in a small enough community someone a few blocks away seen a baby walking in his pj's with no adult and called the cops and kept him with her until the cops got to him. But it could have been absolutely disastrous. <br>  <br>  ALSO, we have to use a lock with an actual key because my daughter figure out how to open the lock with just the slits and got out in middle of the night again. SO if I get 10 thumbs down for saying that I lock my kid in the room at night, I don't care. Its better safe than sorry.<br>  <br>  Edit- I wanted to add this about the baby gate... my daughter mastered the baby gates before she mastered getting out of her room at night. It didnt matter what kind of gate it was, if she couldnt reach the back of it, she plowed it over like a football player and broke it down. So yeah, the gates didnt work for us.
IrLVrdl2aa	You are on the right track. Continue to be encouraging (not demanding). Allow her to be curious and take things at her own pace. Children get nervous if they feel "performance pressure" and catch on that they aren't pleasing mom/dad, which only delays the process.<br>  <br>  Children also have their own developmental pace. It's great that your first daughter potty trained at 18 months, and it's great to start the process now, but allow your younger daughter to have her own unique pace. It could be that tomorrow, everything will "click" and she will never wear a diaper again...or it could be another six months.<br>  <br>  It's also great that you let her see you go potty. Modeling and talking about what is happening helps tremendously. Verbalize WHY you are going potty..."Oh, i think i feel my pee getting ready to come out. I need to go sit on the potty."  And, "I like it when you keep me company in the bathroom. I'll keep you company when you need to go potty, too!"<br>  <br>  No pressure, all praise and patience. You're doing great!<br>  Dawn|`|8yTP3jO8aa	What happens if you wait until she's ready to potty train instead of trying to force it because "that's what her big sister did"?    With what you're doing right now, if she does happen to pee in her potty, it'll only be luck because you're stripping her down and sticking her on it every 30 minutes.  It won't be because she understands that (1) she needs to pee, (2) that she has to hold it until she gets to her potty, and that (3) she has to pee in her potty.|`|2ibfQbLcaa	My daughter is 23 months and potty trained, i potty trained her at 19 months, She loved her cute little potty but she only went in it once in a blue moon.. My patience was wearing dry so I figured Id just TRY one of the little seats for the regular toilet, she was sooo much more enthusiastic to try that, She loved her little potty but this was being just like a big girl to her and she was soo happy!!! What i would do after that is i got a few new books I got bingo and a few otehr singing books.. and we would sit there and sing and read them until she went then as soon as she went we woudl clap and say YAAAAAY!! and Id let her flush, she would get soo excited, after the first couple of times that took like 15 minutes it got easier for her, I would time it, every 30 minutes wghile she was drinking fluids or 45 minutes when she wasnt. I would take her in and she would go instantly! I also rewarded her with one m&m and a sticker everytime, She is always sooo happy yo go to the potty now!! It ook a few months to get it right, we did have a few accidents because i let her wear her big girl undies and when she had an accident it really upset her.. So she learned that when she had that feeling to tell me.. now she goes running towards the potty screaming POOOTTTTYYY (in a cute way) she loves to go now!
1F6KJt0oaa	At 14 weeks I doubt you can feel the baby do much of anything.  You are just out of your first trimester.  If it is something you are concerned about you should talk to your doctor.|`|4qT0TfMZaa	You're not likely to feel the baby kicking this early.  Suggestion: don't push on your belly!|`|QYYWBrG7aa	i`m pretty sure it`s not the baby and for the lady who said at 14 weeks the baby doesnt have legs seems like u need to look up more on pregnancy.|`|BO28Mn8haa	It's definitely not the baby. He hasn't developed legs with the strength to give you a nudge yet! It is likely just your uterus stretching for the baby. Please, stop pushing on your belly :)|`|xLSb3XgCaa	the baby is growing <br>  or it could be the abilical courd stuck
VayJue7vaa	I have started doing Once-A-Month cooking. It is great, and EASY! You simply pick out the meals you make (I make about three different meals a week, it takes about and hour at Costco and a couple hours max to mix the meals up together and throw them in the freezer. It's wonderful because you use bulk ingredents, which tend to be cheaper than buying at a grocery store, and you have a lot of food left over. You make 3 four-searving meals at a time, so I end up with 12 meals in the freezer. All you do after that is make sure they are well labeled and pull out the meal you want in the morning so it is unfrozen by supper time. The meals are great, as you pick the ones you want. I'm not a great cook either, but this is so easy after you get the hang of it (it's hard right away, and takes more time to figure it out).<br>   I bought a great book on-line that is full of suggestions and is well organized and perfect for a non-cook like me called "Fix, Freeze, Feast: Prepare in Bulk and Enjoy by the Serving" by Kati Neville and Lindsay Tkacsik. Check it out on Amazon to look at reviews and see if that's wht you're looking for.|`|VKgD1K3baa	You can make things like lasagna or chicken and rice casserole and freeze them for later. One of my favorite things is crock pot/slow cooker meals. You can prep it the night before and throw it all in a crock pot the next morning; dinner will be ready to eat when you get home that evening!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://allrecipes.com/Recipes/Main-Dish/Slow-Cooker/Main.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://allrecipes.com/Recipes/Main-Dish/...</a>|`|FLEXqVoiaa	My daughter will be 11 months tomorrow. I also work full time and also have a 3 year old at home. I like to give my baby cut up fruit-Bananas and kiwis are her favorites. Very cheap and easy. Also canned veggies can be great as long as they don't have too much sodium. My daughter loves to eat carrots and peas. Veggie "chicken" nuggets are also a favorite-They can be cooked in the microwave in just a minute, and they're easy for her to chew (she only has 2 teeth).|`|Fy9S6hjIaa	One of my favorite make-ahead baby foods were pastas.  There are so many different ways to make it!  For this age, you just have to chop all the ingredients up pretty small.  When he was younger, I would run them in the food processor, but by 11  months, just a quick chop is fine.  I also always use whole wheat pasta!  Then, you can just put it in individual serving sizes, freeze, and thaw as needed!  I also used frozen veggies alot because you can take out just a little bit and cook in the microwave!  Anyway, here's some pasta ideas!<br>  <br>  WW Pasta w/ grilled chicken, broccoli, and cream cheese <br>  ww pasta w/ spaghetti sauce....serve w/ veggie like green beans<br>  ww pasta w/ grilled chicken and alfredo sauce<br>  ww pasta w/ veggies (whatever he likes most) and a sprinkle of cheese<br>  ww pasta w/ italian dressing and fresh tomatoes <br>  <br>  Honestly, pasta was really the only thing that I made ahead of time and froze, but I think that people do it with all sorts of stuff.  By this age your baby can eat almost anything as long as there isn't a choking risk.  So just be creative!  Think of things that you would eat, and just modify them a little bit for the baby.  That's what I always did!<br>  <br>  EDIT--I would also advise against feeding baby canned veggies ever!  They are packed with sodium which can honestly be very harmful for baby's kidneys!  Frozen ones are just a s quick and easy and much more healthy!|`|Ot8lxaMEaa	I work part time and I often face the same dilemna as you. When your baby is a year old, as long as he doesnt have nay allergies he can pretty much eat what the whole family is eating (healthy of course without heavy seasoning and soft enough for him to chew). Have you considered buying a slowcooker/crockpot? You could get a recipe book for one of those, make dinner the night before after the baby goes to bed and then put everything in the pot in the morning and cook on low until you get home.<br>  <br>  There are a lot of foods you can make in advanced and put in the freezer. Casseroles(chicken with vegetables are always good) are easy to freeze and thaw. Whenever I make a spaghetti sauce (a thick one with lots of vegetables and meat) I freeze that and then can defrost in the microwave in about 15 minutes while the pasta is cooking. Scrambled eggs withchopped vegetables and cheese in them with toast are quick easy standbys that I use when in a rush. I would say buy a cook book and figure out meals that you can either make in the morning and cook quickly at night or ones you can make on your days off and freeze. Good luck.|`|0vpDDM8aaa	if i am in a rush...i will sometimes give my daughter a divided plate and put a fruit in one division (bananans, etc) and put some cut up lunch meat in another division, and some cheese or something like that in the third part (if he likes raw veggies...but up some carrots or something as well).  she likes it...she can eat it by herself..and its healthy.|`|955YoHvVaa	Well you eat when you get home don't you? At 11 months old your child can eat the same things you do..so why not just feed him off your plate?!?|`|3oSQQt6maa	i make spaghetti sauce with ground meat on monday and make spaghetti when i am going to feed my son i use it til four days then i throw it out. your son sleeps very early so that gives you time to make a chicken soup, has all the veggies and potatoes, you can use that til about 3 days in the fridge. bake a chicken and feed that to him for about 2 or 3 days, or intruduce him to refried beans, they are cheap and easy to make the beans then you just smash them so he can swallow them. or when i dont have time i get a can of ravioli and maybe corn or green beans and feed that to my son.<br>  There is always time if you make the time.<br>  i go to school.|`|nFE6T6Hgaa	I don't have a lot of time either. If you make any meals in advance your son can eat almost everything you and your husband eat by 11 months. I make muffins and pancakes and freeze them for my son for breakfast and sometimes lunch I add baby cereal and sometimes sweet potatoes to mine because my son refuses to eat most vegis now :) I also give my son grilled cheese (quick and easy if you make them in the oven you don't even have to worry about flippin takes about 5 minutes) I've given my son easy mac and mixed vegis in it. I also by the Del Monte pear and peach chunks to give my son. There are all kinds of cut canned vegis out there you could give him (carrots, green beans, peas, mixed vegie, squash) You can freeze just about anything to feed him. They also make the pasta pick ups that he could probably eat, you might have to cut some of them in half. Hope that's helpful!|`|7rCeCVl2aa	It depends on how much you want to put in to it. You can always start a crock pot meal. Buy a cut of meat, add veggies, add some water or gravy and let it simmer all day while you are gone. When you get home at 6:00 dinner is ready and done. There is usually plenty of left overs too. =)<br>  <br>  You can google "Easy Crock Pot Recipes" and I am sure you can find plenty of basic crock pot recipe books.<br>  <br>  Hope that helped a little.
USrhxMW9aa	They can deny seeing your son, the same thing happened to my sister in law but she just found another doctor that doesn't mind.  I am now going to the same doctor because I too am not immunizing my child.  I may start when he is around 2 but I haven't decided yet.  I'm not doing it for religious beliefs but for personal ones - I was never immunized and neither were my siblings and we are perfectly healthy and were able to be seen by doctors and go to school. <br>  <br>  For the people that don't understand the religious belief part: It is my understanding that those who choose not to immunize for religious beliefs is because they feel that they are acting against God's will in which they are then acting as God.  Oh, and for the person who responded saying something to the effect that the Bible says you should immunize (lol) - I don't think they had immunizations back when it was written...<br>  <br>  P.S.<br>     Since when is chicken pox seen as life threatening?  Don't the majority of people get chicken pox when they're kids, with or without the immunization?  I personally have never heard of someone dying from this|`|T9fek24eaa	There is no law suit, it is not religious discrimination. It is the pediatricians choice to see or not see kids that are not immunized actually. MOST pediatricians will not see kids that are not immunized actually. <br>  <br>   Are you going to say "religious discrimination" when your child is not allowed into school because they have not received their vaccinations too? It really has nothing to do with religion and everything to do with your child and everyone else's childrens safety.|`|dIJMuCSyaa	I think you should have the right not to immunize your child like other parents have the right to immunize. I say look for a doctor that will not act like that that will respect your right not to immunize your child and good luck.|`|LRJmHA7vaa	It is my opinion that just as you have the right to not immunize, this doctor should have the right to not see your child. There are plenty of Doctors out there with similar beliefs as yours. Seek them out. Ask your minister if they know of someone. Ask other parents with your same beliefs.|`|4fded85bb017fba5407e3727176079ffaa	On what religious grounds do you object?  You do not say.  <br>  <br>  However, from what I understand from the bible, there are no laws/rules against immunizing children.  In fact, it is in their best interests.<br>  <br>  They cannot attend a mainstream school without the immunizations either, again, from my understanding.<br>  <br>  My son missed one immunization and they told him not to come back to school until he had it.<br>  <br>  I don't think that you will get by with using your religious beliefs as a reason for the lack of immunizations.  <br>  <br>  I have never heard of this before.  Call an attorney, I doubt one will take your case.|`|QLDoKll1aa	Wow! That doesn't sound right to me. I am also not immunizing for religious beliefs and I would definitely be shocked if something like that happened to me. <br>  <br>  From what my pediatrician told me, it's totally up to the parents to immunize or not. I just had to sign a form stating that I declined immunizations. It was wrong for that doc to make it a MUST, but I don't know if you can press any kind of charges. I live in CA so I'm not sure if the laws are the same where you are but I'd call an attorney just to see if anything can be done. <br>  <br>  At the very least, ditch the doc--for sure.|`|o5jSID4Jaa	I don't think it is religious discrimination. The dr doesn't want any other patients to be exposed to things your child may catch because he isn't vaccinated. I don't think you have grounds to say this dr didn't see you because of your religious beliefs. If you can choose to not have your child vaccinated then the dr should have the right to choose not to see your child as a patient.|`|sxahupRTaa	He is not descriminating against your religion he is discriminating against a very poor decision you have made about the health of your son. He is also safegaurding the welfare of every other patient that is seen in his office. What will be a true shame is when your son gets sick from a simple disease like chicken pox, mumps, measles, or rubella that could possibly be fatal. All of these diseases are still carried by the population but are not generally seen because of vaccinations. You should reevaluate your decision to play Russian roulette with your sons health and do the right thing as a responsible parent.|`|G2auAv1Saa	Since your son is 4 and has always been seeing this doctor, he should have already known your stance. Perhaps this was a new person in the office that wasn't aware of how to deal with your situation. I would consider this first. If this is not the case I don't think this is religious discrimination. The doctor has a policy and in a private practice he is allowed to pick and choose what cases to take. Doctors have a lot of liabilities to think of and this is why they are able to do this. If you were at the emergency room this would be a different story as they have to provide emergency care regardless of any circumstances. A private doctor office on a non-emergency is allowed to deny care. If he is not willing to see your son any longer, you will need to find a doctor who will see your child under these circumstances. Since it is in line with your religion, speak with members of your church and ask where they take their children.|`|dzyJw0cvaa	If you want to take legal action, go for it.  Or maybe you should just try to find a new clinic to go to, one that wont try and shove you out the door.  i find itinteresting that they didnt even notice he wasnt immnized until he was four years old...prolly not the best clinic.<br>  <br>  I dont understand the religious aspect of this though...I am not trying to be rude, i am just curious.  What kind of belief system would teach you that you shouldnt protect your child from the terrible life threatenig diseases that are out there? Dont you think that god would want us to take advantage of the technology and medical benefits that we have?  Once again, i am not saying this to be mean, i just really dont understand!<br>  <br>  Good luck though...i hope things work out for you.|`|heDtLdz5aa	the doctor has every right to choose who his patients are..it is called a private practice..just like a private school as the right to not enroll your child..i haven't heard of any religious beliefs in not immunizing your child...i think it is just your personal belief.. so go find a doctor who is will to care for a child whose parents don't immunize|`|r782jijgaa	This doctor has the right to refuse service just as you have the right to not immunize your child.  What are you going to do when the child starts school and immunizations are required?|`|NAzAmFDnaa	I think doctors have the option to drop patients for various reasons.  I worked in a nursing home and from time to time a doctor would drop a difficult patient.  I think it may be the doctor's choice who they continue to see as patients.  I know you are hurt, but perhaps finding a more open-minded, cooperative doctor will ultimately be in your son's best interest.  It won't hurt to ask a lawyer, but there might not be much legal recourse.  Sorry your doctor was a jerk.|`|NbJbZXtGaa	A lot of docs have that policy. I would not push the issue if they don't want you there. Instead, look for a pediatrician in your area that is open to your decision. My cousin has four kids that are not vaccinated (for other reasons) and they have a doctor that they love.<br>  <br>  BTW, they are not denying your son the "right" to medical care. They are just denying him treatment at their private practice. You are free to see another doctor of your choosing that agrees with (or at least allows) your decision. Isn't fee will great?!! imagine if you truly had to deal with the religious persecution that goes on in some countries. It is truly a travesty.
dgRTkccBaa	I think she's going to be able to drag her feet in any stroller, you just have to make her keep her feet on the little foot strap.  My son is shorter than your daughter and he always used to drag his feet and I just had to keep making him put his feet back on the footrest.  Eventually he got it and does it much less now.  He sometimes puts his feet on the wheels and I just have to tell him not to do it over and over again and eventually he listens (probably because he's sick of hearing me!)<br>  BTW, I'm shorter than you and have no trouble lifting my DOUBLE jogger, they're really not that heavy.They can be awkward, but not really all that heavy.|`|6VbNJOtfaa	I have yet to come across a light weight stroller that is not cheaply made.  I love my jogging stroller, and if you get the right one, you will be able to maneuver and lift it.  I am your exact height and weight and I have no problem whatsoever with my Bell jogging stroller (it is way lighter than the car seat/stroller combo stroller I originally had).<br>  <br>  I would say to try some out and you may be surprised.  Unless you have some sort of medical condition you should have no trouble finding one that is right for you.

cYRZpGkqaa	I was offended because it's a choice, and it doesn't make us lazy. I have seen a few of her Q&As before and had nothing but respect for her, but if I honestly met her now, I would probably spit on her. I don't criticize others for their choices and I don't expect such a blatant attack on mine. Clearly she can't be as amazing as she says she is because she still has a lot of growing up to do.|`|AkFag8tNaa	I didn't have as much a problem w/her question until she said "are you starting to realize something". Yes, I realize I'm incredibly busy on many days and less busy on others but still very productive and tired at the end of the day like every other mom. I have a schedule on the days that my youngest is in preschool (MWF). It seems like since I'm already out the door, a schedule really works on those days. The other days, I just do what needs to get done.|`|prqrQcd1aa	My kids have a schedule.. I have to many things happening in between times if i were to have a schedule for myself i'd go nuts! I do have a basic schedule for like what time to wake up, what time to go to sleep, when I can get on here, etc...but other than that, NOPE no schedule!|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	i think BoSox spoke perfectly|`|oIyXMnmcaa	Oh I dont know...<br>  I answered her question cause I thought it was interesting. I dont really care either way if I am being judged--by her or anyone else for that matter. I know what my schedule is and how hard it can be sometimes. I have been a mother for 5 years now and those are dedicated years so I have the right to complain every now and again...but I dont on here; I vent to my mom or my SIL and get it off my chest cause they too, are both mothers with 10+ experience and they know how tough and draining mother hood can be. <br>  I love my life as a SAHM but I cant wait to start work either...life is stressful at times but with these two little ones I created; I would not change a thing. <br>  Those are my standards and I am not concered with anyone else's either.|`|jLYTKr33aa	As I've said before, I strongly believe that anyone who participates in the "Mommy (or Daddy) Wars" is immature and insecure when it comes to their parenting.  I don't think Northstar is a mother at all, but rather a 12 - year - old child.  If she is a mother, she's clearly one who's immature and unsure of herself as a parent.  Either way, she's an ignorant twit.  Pay no mind to her.<br>  As for not having a schedule, that doesn't bother me one bit.  My career wasn't/isn't one that had a set schedule; every day there were different challenges and demands.  I am the kind of person who likes variety and adventure, so having a rigid schedule to follow every day would bore me.|`|AA11210211	lolI think that lady is hilarious really she is 40 yrs old and likes to pick fights!!!

I certainly enjoy my life as sahm and I didn't feel the need to justify a schedule. I'm not in the army, I see no point for regime as I'm more of a fly by the seat of my pants girl. The job gets done and the kids are happy so it's all good.<br>  <br>  I saw her answer in one q that obviously set her off, I feel sorry for her.> She's obviously feeling hard done by and can do nothing but lash out to users on here to vent her frustration. Sad girl.
em8A42Bqaa	I've heard several times that the line does indeed fade.  I dont know about the belly button, but most people I know that had a potruding belly button, it went back in.  The stretch marks I have heard dont go away, but there are several things that you can use to reduce them.
UM9LlPWDaa	I'm confused as to if he will be happy or mad too. I would talk to him about how he would feel if it turned out you were so you know if you are on the same page.

82a4bd999404bced3be0ccff2c393a40aa	WIC (Women Infants Children) provides Federal grants to States for supplemental foods, health care referrals, and nutrition education for low-income pregnant, breastfeeding, and non-breastfeeding postpartum women, and to infants and children up to age five who are found to be at nutritional risk.<br>  <br>   To be eligible for the WIC Program, applicants must meet all of the following eligibility requirements:<br>  <br>      * Categorical<br>      * Residential<br>      * Income<br>      * Nutrition Risk<br>  Categorical Requirement<br>  <br>  The WIC Program is designed to serve certain categories of women, infants, and children.  Therefore, the following individuals are considered categorically eligible for WIC:<br>  Women  -- pregnant (during pregnancy and up to 6 weeks <br>     after the birth of an infant or the end of the <br>     pregnancy)<br>  -- postpartum (up to six months after the birth of <br>     the infant or the end of the pregnancy)<br>  -- breastfeeding (up to the infant's first birthday)<br>  Infants  (up to the infant's first birthday)<br>  Children  (up to the child's fifth birthday)<br>  Residential Requirement<br>  <br>  Applicants must live in the State in which they apply.  Applicants served in areas where WIC is administered by an Indian Tribal Organization (ITO) must meet residency requirements established by the ITO. At State agency option, applicants may be required to live in a local service  area and apply at a WIC clinic that serves that area. Applicants are not required to live in the State or local service area for a certain amount of time in order to meet the WIC residency requirement.<br>  Income Requirement<br>  <br>  To be eligible for WIC, applicants must have income at or below an income level or standard set by the State agency or be determined automatically income-eligible based on participation in certain programs.<br>  Income Standard  The State agency's income standard must be between 100 percent of the Federal poverty guidelines (issued each year by the Department of Health and Human Services), but cannot be more than 185 percent of the Federal poverty income guidelines.<br>  Automatic Income Eligibility  Certain applicants can be determined income-eligible for WIC based on their participation in certain programs.  These included individuals:<br>   -- eligible to receive SNAP benefits, Medicaid, for Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF, formerly known as AFDC, Aid to Families with Dependent Children),<br>   -- in which certain family members are eligible to receive Medicaid or TANF, or<br>   -- at State agency option, individuals that are eligible to participate in certain other State-administered programs.<br>  Nutrition Risk Requirement<br>  <br>  Applicants must be seen by a health professional such as a physician, nurse, or nutritionist who must determine whether the individual is at nutrition risk.  In many cases, this is done in the WIC clinic at no cost to the applicant.  However, this information can be obtained from another health professional such as the applicant's physician.<br>  <br>  "Nutrition risk" means that an individual has medical-based or dietary-based conditions.  Examples of medical-based conditions include anemia (low blood levels), underweight, or history of poor pregnancy outcome.  A dietary-based condition includes, for example, a poor diet.<br>  <br>  At a minimum, the applicant's height and weight must be measured and bloodwork taken to check for anemia.<br>  <br>  An applicant must have at least one of the medical or dietary conditions on the State's list of WIC nutrition risk criteria.<br>  <br>  * * *<br>  Contact the WIC State or local agency serving your area, to schedule an appointment.  Applicants will be advised about what to bring to the WIC appointment to help determine eligibility. Many of the State agencies listed provide a toll-free number for you to call and/or a website about the WIC Program operating in that area.|`|6ITgXvBWaa	You can get Cash Assistance, Food Stamps, WIC while you are pregnant and after the baby is born, Medicaid.|`|xV0APOtaaa	If you live on your own you may qualify for foodstamps (I didn't because my mom collects them too and I still live at home) But otherwise you should still qualify for MA(medical assistance) to cover your pre-natal visits and delivery and WIC. To continue collecting these benefits after you have the baby you will have to be willing to cooperate with Child Support by giving over any information you have on the baby's father (full name, phone #, last known address, employer, etc....) After the baby is born you should qualify for Childcare Assistance too (daycare tuition) if you need it. You get to pick your own provider and hours etc. only condition is they have to be state certified to get government assistance.<br>  <br>  Where I live we have a pregnancy helpline. They allow you 3-4 visits a year. You can get a dozen diapers, 4 outfits, and a few other things at EACH visit or if they have them available, they offer you cribs, high chairs, strollers, etc ONCE and only once. My daughter is 2 now, but I had to use them a couple times and they're a wonderful place.<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK!!!|`|BhZmRJSBaa	try medicaid and food stamps. see if you qualify. those are big helps.

xK6wehG7aa	Poor little guy! The only thing I can suggest is keep asking for referrals. If one doctor won't do it, ask to be sent to someone else until you can find a doctor. Just make sure you check out his credentials. Also, ask why they want to wait. They could be worried about doing damage to his facial structure since he's so young. Just go in and demand answers!|`|GBC39wHAaa	Your best bet is probably to take him to the emergency room have him seen then the pediatriac doctor will contact the surgeon to make a recommendation or tell you how to treat the problem if surgery is out of the question. <br>  <br>  Alternative to the ER, call your pediatrician tell her it's bleeding but that the oral surgeon won't operate because he's too young what should you do? I would venture she may say take him to the emergency room.|`|WIeCX71Daa	You just have to keep ringing around and asking. My son only had to have ear tubes at 21 months and I had a hard time finding a surgeon to do the Op (If it hadn't of been done he would have been deaf forever). The main problem is that Surgeons and Anesthetists don't like to put kids under general anesthetic that are under 2 years old because it can cause more problems with breathing and blood pressure.<br>  <br>  Be firm, don't take no for an answer. If you have medical insurance, then someone will help.|`|Z8Ui1ugLaa	I haven't had this kind of problem but have had problems finding an orthopedic for my daughter who needed surgery on her hand.  Keep looking you will find someone to see your child, ask around your local area and through the hospital website, etc.  We ended up find a hand specialist at Columbia University but it was all so difficult.  Good Luck

And its their body so if they don't want that baby well its their decision whether we like it or not.|`|30ecbe20cb8d75d58c2d766f12003e87aa	how can anyone think it's a bad thing?|`|9ro8fiKvaa	How can anyone think that choice is not a right of everyone's? Please do not think that I am promoting abortion - I just think that this is an interesting venue to have everyone think about the concept of choice and the consequences of that one person's choice. The obvious questions is: What kind of a choice does the foetus have? None of course - laws have obliterated it's choices. What kind fo a choice does the father have - whether you consider the affects of childcare and the life long relationship with this child and its mother, child support, adoption, being a single parent or abortion? What about the grandparents who may have to face rearing the child of an irresponsible set of biological parents? The funding you can receive from the government as parents is not the same even if you are the primary caregivers. Consider the child who has been afflicted with a terrible disease - genetic or one that has been passed on by its mother. <br>  <br>  No one EVER behaves 100% responsibly. (Taking sick days when we want to chill at home, taking an extra 20 mins for lunch without permission, drunk driving, all levels of lying, etc.) As humans we can see options in life that we can become informed about and make decisions based on the ultimate consequences of our future actions ... or not. I feel that as long as informed decisions are made we, as individual humans can reconcile ourselves to whomever we happen to answer to.|`|jBdvUQEXaa	How about if the baby shows signs of "incompatibility with life" and would like as not die at birth? Should the mother be forced to carry a baby to term, simply for it to die? Is this better for the mother or the child?<br>  <br>  Or if the baby is so badly affected by deformity that its life would be completely compromised? Is it better to bring life into this world that would be in constant pain, unable to communicate, or move or end that life?<br>  <br>  How about if the pregnancy concerned is one of many, I am pg for the 4th time, if I found out that this baby is severly compromised I would have to consider abortion, I have three other children and a step son to consider too.<br>  <br>  How about if the mother's mental state could simply not cope?<br>  <br>  How about if birth control fails? A girl says I never want kids, they use bc and it doesnt work? Should the woman be forced to carry a child she doesnt want?<br>  <br>  It's easy to pass judgement - harder to understand other peoples reasonings.<br>  <br>  Claire|`|ozWi3TJlaa	I'm not defending abortion, but do you think you might feel differently if your mother/sister/aunt/best friend was brutally gang-raped and ended up pregnant?  I don't know how I'd feel, I'm just presenting that idea.  If it were my daughter it might make a difference in my opinion about this subject.<br>  <br>  I don't think this is a problem unique to the U.S.  Also, being a guy, you might have more difficulty understanding that having choices about your own body being determined by the government means not having the same freedoms for everyone.|`|oWbuSaWZaa	In my opinion it's up to everyone how they see this topic. <br>  Personally I don't agree with it. For people who have unprotected sex and take this route it is cowardly, disgusting and selfish. It's a form of murder and there are people in jail for doing them kind of things. But in the case of rape and things like that my opinion completely changes, I honestly don't know if I could be sure if I got pregnant through rape that I would feel the right love for the child as I would always see his face in my child's eyes.|`|FpeEJbhaaa	Way to go, judging a choice that you will never have to face.  One day, maybe, you'll actually face a problem or trial in your life and learn a little sympathy for people who don't lead perfect existences.|`|s1utniuvaa	I don't think so many people are saying that the actual abortion is ok and no one cares. I think for many pro-choice people the issue is the woman's right to choose and keeping the government out of our uterus's. It is called pro-choice for that reason, who walks around saying that they are pro-abortion? I personally am not a fan of abortion but my opinion is that while I may not choose to have one myself it is none of my business what other people do with their bodies. I am not going to raise their baby. Some people make me sick with the amount of abortions they have and I think they should have their reproductive organs ripped out. They will suffer in the long run if they can't have children when they want them. But that is my personal opinion and their choice.|`|5X6C4s7zaa	We are all individuals entitled to our own opinions, you cannot fault someone else for having a different way of life as yours.  It's very easy to preach about something when you are not the one in the situation, I am not saying I agree with abortion but I am also not going to go around and condemn anyone who has made this very personal and private choice.|`|3X0t8JrXaa	I don't agree personally but I think with regulations its something that should continue to be pro-choice.|`|dDVAUA9saa	And your question is....?<br>  <br>  How can people think beating their children is not a bad thing to do, yet it happens every day.|`|3NyM1cq5aa	You're a man so that is easy for you to say.<br>  Way to try to get things stirred up.

SnQvsOPwaa	A lot of towns and hospitals run newcomers or parenting groups. The key is to get involved with something else.|`|OLW0Irbhaa	My best suggestions are to  look in the community to see what kinds of free and low-cost kid activities there are.  That gets you all out of the house and you will meet other moms with kids the age of your own.  Try the library for storytime, activities, local parks, etc.  Also, look on-line to see if there is a moms group in your area.  I would bet there is.  They are a fantastic life-line to the "real world"  They have playgroups for the kids, moms night out, etc.|`|AA11148769	I know exactly how you feel - it's how I felt for about the first 6 months of staying home.  Since then, I've just gotten involved.  Find a MOPS group (mothers of preschoolers) in your area.  It's a great way to meet other mothers of young children.  They have provided childcare for your children while you are at the MOPS meeting (which is pretty much just some mom time with other moms and a fun activity and discussion).  They also usually have playgroup and "moms night out" throughout the month.  When you meet new moms there, see if they have any playgroups set up that you can attend.  <br>  For example, here's what I do to get out.  I'm a SAHM of two small children ages 3 and 1.  My husband is in the military, so he's not home a lot and is gone for months at a time.  To keep my sanity, I attend MOPS once a month (here it's the second Tuesday of the month) and at the monthly MOPS meeting, we set up the playgroup and mom's night out schedule for the month.  We usually do two playgroups during the month (usually on Monday mornings) and one mom's night out (where we go to someone's home and their husband watches the kids while the moms play games, talk and just have fun (obviously, I don't host this one at my house!).  We also do a playgroup the third Thursday of every month from 9 a.m. to noon.   Every Wednesday, we have a mom's Bible study from 9 a.m. to 11:30 p.m.  Every other Thursday morning, I go over to a friend's house (she's a stay at home mom of 4 kids ages 6, 4, 2, and newborn) and we just hang out and talk while the kids play.  I also get together every other week with my husband's aunt who is also a SAHM of 4, and then I also have some playdates during the week with other moms that I've met through MOPS.  Just get out there girl!  It sounds hard, and it took me awhile too because I am SOOO shy!  But once I got involved, it became easy and FUN too!  MOPS really opened a lot of doors for me!  You can go to their website (just google MOPS) to find a group near you.  Just hang in there girl!  God bless!|`|2WWEn2mZaa	When Dad gets home then go out and do something. Go to the library or to the park and enjoy walking ALONE. Just because you are a SAHM does not mean the job is all yours 24/7. When he gets home then you have a partner that has to do his share too.|`|SJPfjaS0aa	I'm a SAHM to 2 infants and can totally relate. I've been slowly trying to take better care of myself so I can feel better (getting a haircut, small manicure). Have you tried going out a bit? maybe join a mom/tot program? are some of your kids in school?|`|Y3DR1EBUaa	Wow how do u feel lonley with 4.. i have one & only feel lonely because he cant talk lol...<br>  <br>  try doing activities withthem try to pass the time|`|d5479b73829d5fa0818d9eec2850a058aa	I have three, 2 are still toddlers.  This is going to sound really harsh but you just have to get your head around it.  Even if you were surrounded by other mums they'd still have to take care of their kids and wouldn't have that much time for hanging out.  You dont say how old your kids are so it's hard to suggest activities.  There must be a library local to you and they'll have local information as well as access to books that can give you ideas for activities etc.
nQ7ZcUI3aa	I have met a Myra but I have never met a Mia, and I meet several new people every week with my job, I have seen it more recently, but I don't think that Mia is popular enough for you to worry about, I love the meaning and I love that you are naming your daughter after you. It is a great name that flows beautiful, she will be proud to have a name like that.|`|TAufQoc7aa	No i think its the most beautiful name, I'm so sad I can never use it because of my surname, which begins with the "MEE" sound, so as you can imagine it would sound ridiculous for us :-(  but no i say go for it I dont think its too popular at all. Mya is also gorgeous,<br>  <br>  Congrats!<br>  x|`|gu1sEQN8aa	No i dont know a lot of Mia's at all. i think its really unique and you seriously wont have other kids named Mia.

If you add the "y" people are more likely to pronounce it correctly, however, if you dont and leave as that way you spelled it, then people may call her "Mee-ah" which in Spanish it means "mine". It's a very nice name. My co-worker's baby is Mya and I have a co-worker named Joyce (her real name is Jocelyn). They are both common but I haven't heard of them being combined. I doubt you'll have two Mia's in that same classroom. GOodluck.|`|hOw4Gncmaa	I only know one Mia, who is a six-ish month old. I love the name, and I don't honestly think it is that popular right not. My generation there isn't many Mia's, but maybe this generation [your daughters], or the next, Mia will become more popular. But I think it is safe to say that it isn't all that common. For now... :D|`|Hx5ugKZnaa	Although i often get mistaken for a Mia.... my name is Nia..I have never actually met a Mia before and think its such a beautiful name.<br>  <br>  I love the fact theres also a meaning behind your choice..this always makes a name unique and special.<br>  <br>  xx|`|KvbiUAUhaa	aww cute, i know of one mia, but its a singer lol, its a really nice name, n has a beautful backround to it, she might be named m-j tho haha :)|`|eJMIazhLaa	I don't know of any Mia's.

They had the trash can, the Lightening Mqueen lamp, we put Lightening blankets up to the windows as curtains, we got the table and chairs set, we even got the Lightening toddler beds.

We even found wall decor with Cars so needless to say, we got those as well. <br>  <br>  Their room is a big splash of red and blue, thanks to all the stuff.
oB8bbiwWaa	i doubt she is pregnant but there is a possibility.<br>  <br>  by the way, she is no longer a virgin.  if you "put it in her," even halfway, it is penetration.|`|3X0t8JrXaa	There's always a possibility.  At 18 you both should know how a woman can get pregnant.  All those times you went halfway you could've gotten pre-*** in her.  There's different things that can come into play like where she's at in her cycle and so on.  All you can do at this point is wait and test.  Going forward if you don't want this type of problem use condoms...even if you're only going "half way".|`|wzXJOSIeaa	Well she is DEF. NOT a virgin anymore. You were her first no matter how you look at it. At that point you just as well go ahead and do it. I don't think she is pregnant. Sperm can NOT live outside the body. So just relax and try not to worry. I'm sure her period will come.|`|8Cvv86Jeaa	You cant get pregnant unless you ejaculate in her. Sound like you just went everywhere else. So no. She's just sick. But if you are that worried about her getting pregnant maybe she should get on the pill. Even if you two are just "messing around" it could escalate into something more one day and it doesn't sound like either of you are ready yet. Finish school then have babies! You will enjoy them more.|`|8SnKiFypaa	Ok first of all take a breather. I would be very surprised if your gf was pregnant. The so called symptoms she feels is most likely just stress and thinking about it to much. You won't have symptoms of pregnancy within a few days. Of course anything is possible but I'm telling you she is probably not pregnant.|`|xhqKLSwCaa	It's only been 5 days, and its too early to show signs of pregnancy.  the more she worries the more chance of becoming sick or causing her period to be out of whack from the worry stress.  Calm down take a breather.  You didn't use protection so you KNEW there was a chance of pregnancy.  All you can do is wait until her period and go to a doctor and if you don't use protection and you get pregnant theirs no one to blame but the 2 involved.|`|tdIuoIc1aa	relax, symptoms don't show up that fast. just be more careful or get her on the pill.|`|4ygxh6vNaa	keep your head up and stay positive first off :). Secondly, sometimes when you think your pregnant your brain starts make-believing that your getting certain symptoms (ie. sick feeling, cravings ext.) The chances of her being pregnant right now are very slim, however if you are that worried, tell your gf to go see her Doctor, he can send her for a blood test and that will determine if she is pregnant or not, blood tests work within 5 days of getting pregnant. Or just explain to her that the more she panics the more her mind is going to make her believe she is pregnant. <br>  <br>  Good luck to you both, and next time be Safe :)|`|jBdvUQEXaa	1. Its highly unlikely that she is pregnant! There are only really 2 days a month that she would be likely to conceive. And although you could in theory get pregnant from sperm deposited at the entrance to the vagina it simply is against the odds that she is pregnant. But since you have had this scare, practice safe sex in future<br>  <br>  2. Its too late for the morning after pill now any way - it needs to be taken within 72 hours of sex.<br>  <br>  3. Even if she were pg its unlikely that she would be feeling any symptoms after 5 days, its most likely stress.<br>  <br>  4. All you can do is wait until her period is due and do a HPT. Follow the instructions carefully and make your plans from there.<br>  <br>  Good luck - and please take more care in the future!<br>  <br>  Claire
oB8bbiwWaa	yes to all three.  by the way, try to spell it correctly if it is on your brain so much.<br>  <br>  S E X.|`|Z8Ui1ugLaa	Yes you can have sex when you are pregnant.  I think you would be too young to have sex if you haven't had your period.  And yes you can get pregnant if you haven't had your period yet, you wouldn't know if your body was getting ready to ovulate and begin your period.|`|Fh4B88ZGaa	You're not ready to have sex. You need to wait.|`|eU5Eth2aaa	You can have sex while you are pregnant, unless your doctor advises otherwise.<br>  <br>  If you haven't hit puberty (started your period) then you are waaaaay to young to have sex anyways.<br>  <br>  If you have sex during your first ovulation cycle before you start your first period, then yes, you can become pregnant.<br>  <br>  Don't be embarrassed to ask your mom these things!  It's actually nice to be able to talk to a parent about things like this!<br>  <br>  Just remember..It's always better to wait until you are TOTALLY ready to have an intimate relationship with someone.  And when you do, USE PROTECTION!  Please...  :)|`|3X0t8JrXaa	yes, yes, no (if you mean never started), and you need to ask her...if you're old enough to wonder you should be old enough to sit down and ask your mom|`|QYYWBrG7aa	yes.yes.no.|`|66bc4129385331039e67c99220c312fcaa	if you cant ask your mom then you aren't old enough to have SEX.|`|x0PKm4qLaa	Yes to all three questions.<br>  Sex is fine during pregnancy as far as health reasons go.<br>  You can have sex if you haven't had your period-you still have the right parts:)<br>  And yes-while it is rare-you can get pregnant from having sex without ever having your period. It because you had sex when you were ovulating for the first time and never got your period because to egg was fertilized and now there's a baby growing.<br>  any more questions? Hope this helps.|`|rDw9N09iaa	im not gonna be like everyone else on here and talk down on you and tell you that you arent ready for sex. imma be straight and answer your questions:<br>  yes, you can have sex while you are pregnant. it just isnt all that good of an idea once you get to like the last month or two.<br>  yes, you can have sex if you havent had your period.<br>  and yes, you can get pregnant if you havent had your period.|`|O5WberWnaa	you can have sex when your pregnant...if your pregnancy is going good.<br>  you can have sex if you havnt had your period<br>  if you havnt even started your periods you cannot get pregnant<br>  the best thing to do hun is ask your mum,shel give the best advice|`|hVVALFAPaa	Yes.<br>  <br>  Yes.<br>  <br>  Yes.<br>  <br>  If you feel uncomfortable writing out the word SEX, then you are too young to have it. You should be able to ask your mom these questions. Don't rely on your friends or the internet for your sexual education. Mom is better.|`|CIZjK2rAaa	You should not be having sex.  If you don't want to talk to your mom, you should find someone you trust that you can talk to.|`|xWYKqcDjaa	Yes, you can have sex when pregnant. You can have sex whenever you want.<br>  But if your missing periods, most likely your pregnant.
NbJbZXtGaa	No, not at all. My son was standing in my lap form about three months. He walked at eight months and was not bowlegged whatsoever.|`|dgRTkccBaa	Yes and no, babies who 'stand' on their own for short amounts of time won't become bow-legged, what they maean when they say not to stand a baby up too soon is not to leave them in an exersaucer or walker for long periods of time with too much weight on their legs because that can bow their legs.  That's why the exersaucer instructions say to only let the baby's toes touch the bottom so most of the weight is on the seat.|`|s4aX6bF6aa	i think if you're worried about your child becoming bowlegged you should talk with his/her pediatrician...but other than that i think it's fine to stand a kid up whenever...i don't think it will affect them like that.|`|AA10529334	If you stand baby up and he/she pushes themselves up and down on your leg then its fine. They are doing the standing and it must be ok or they wouldnt love it so much.
93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	exactly what pippin said<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/bf/tandem/links-nursingpregnant.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/bf/tandem/links-...</a>|`|vue9NOhYaa	Yes, unless you're at high risk for miscarriage.  <br>  <br>  (Many women nurse through the pregnancy and go on to tandem nurse both children.  Others opt to wean at some point (or baby self-weans) because their nipples get sore, or the supply drops, or the taste of the milk changes ... or they just want a break.  The choice is yours.)|`|XhIYAH6Laa	Check out this website....it has the answers to your question...good luck!
chmuDZObaa	I'm so sorry...I was like you for the first 16 weeks but by week 17 I felt a little bit better and by week 20 I was actually enjoying the pregnancy.  Have you tried asking your OB for anti-nausea medicine?  There are plenty out there that are proven safe and effective.  I know Phenergen is the oldest and most widely known.  It does make you really sleepy but at least you can get to sleep and get some relief!  I also took Zofran which was awesome and didn't make me groggy.   Make your doctor take your problem seriously and help you.  You don't have to be this miserable!  And above all, remember its not permanent and there is a BIG reward at the end!  Good luck.|`|OPTDFRuzaa	hey i sympathise i was the same but my sickness and nausea subsided at 14 weeks luckily! hang in there it will pass and get easier. you will forget about this and want another one day. once you meet your baby you will forget it. good luck.|`|BWUlksmmaa	It sounds like you should be signed off work on bed rest.  How do you deal with a job when you are that sick?  I know you say now that you'll never have another baby, but like many things in life (drinking too much alcohol, trying to climb a huge mountain etc) - once you are over the pain you forget the bad and are eager to do it again.  Many people have other pregnancies with no morning sickness when their first one was bad.  Wait until you see your healthy baby and you'll change your mind!  Make sure through the bad, you show your husband how much you appreciate and love him.  He is trying so hard and he can't make the pain go away.  I'm sure he'd take it off you if he could!  Sounds like mine...|`|hfHnjjmXaa	poor gal. every woman has very different experience. it is tough being pregnant n having to handle all the extreme synptoms. u can ask ur doc for anti-nausea pills to help u curb the vomitting. i know how difficult it is as i was vomitting alot during the first 4 months of my pregnancy. I cant eat much too. i was worried too but i delivered a pair of healthy twin gals. all the best n soon it will be over. please do bear with it. n look on the bright side. u'll get to carry a cute baby in ur arms in a few months time.|`|kUQf11syaa	My sister who is 23, recently had the same issues with her pregnancy.  Since she works for an insanely busy law firm in Boston, her stress was quantified with the sickness from being pregnant.  <br>  Her OB/GYN could not do anything for her and after weeks of what seemed like non-stop vomiting, she finally went to see  holistic practitioner. This Dr. talked with her about her diet, which was the root issue. After some short meal planning, and a few days of making the changes to her diet, she felt a lot better.<br>  You may also want to look into medical marijuana if this is available in your community.  MM can really help with nausea and studies have confirmed that this is completely safe for the baby.<br>  Best wishes to you.|`|vCq3dR40aa	Hang in there.  <br>  Try to drink as much as you can.  My sister had a terrible time with morning sickness like you.  She combated it with a few things.<br>  1.  Get some good vitamins.  Liquid ones if you can keep them down.  They absorb better.  (the docs told me to keep taking what I had even when I was in the hospital instead of switching to prenatals)<br>  2. Ginger helps sooth the stomach.  So Ginger tea, ginger snaps, ginger pills, liquid ginger from the health food store can be added to honey<br>  3.  This recipe for chicken broth<br>  Chicken Soup for the Body<br>  Combine and simmer for 1/2 hr.<br>     28 oz chicken broth<br>  6-8 green onions sliced small<br>  1/2 inch to 1 inch ginger pealed and chopped small<br>  <br>  Strain out all the chunks and drink the broth warm or hot.<br>  It is good for colds and flu too.<br>  <br>  I didn't put on any weight until almost 20 weeks either.  In my case, it was a boost in metabolism followed by a week of being extremely constipated due to pain medication.<br>  <br>  I was also not entirely thrilled to be pregnant.  Fresh air and some exercise if you can find a way to do some that doesn't make you sick could help your general outlook, which could aid your symptoms.  <br>  Perhaps bundle up and sit outside or in front of a sunny window for a while.|`|5cfrig5Eaa	my daughter was doing the same thing you are you need to ask your doctor to put you on this ONDANSETRON ODT 4MG TABLES it will keep you from getting sick when taken this you might still get sick maybe once a day if not any  i hope eveything goes well with you|`|YCFgIRufaa	I think the way you're feeling is normal.  I was sick and didn't start feeling some joy until 18 weeks so maybe your relief is just around the corner. I know some women stay sick the whole time. :( Hang in there. I still hate being pregnant but I love my baby. Its always something even though the sickness is gone...headaches, congestion, body aches, no sleep... its hard and frustrating.  There were times I felt I couldn't go on but you can.|`|bfmoMc4Haa	sweetie you sound just like me,<br>  <br>  i got pregnant one month after a beautiful wedding and was excited and happy and felt wonderful to share it with my new husband. but by week 6 the CONSTANT nausea and vomiting began. i was completely miserable with a pounding headache and i always felt like i was on a swaying boat and sea sick....horrible and unbearable.<br>  <br>  i longed for week 12 to arrive and i heard thats when the majority of the morning/noon/and night sickness starts to ease but it didnt. even drinking water was hard and i often vomited it back up. i felt like giving up and felt resentful of the baby and how bad it made me feel.<br>  <br>  ok my doctor perscribed me Zofran which is an anti nausea pill that did help a little to keep some food down. it is safe to take in pregnancy and its necessary to take because your baby needs nourisment now its in the 2nd trimester. ginger/lemon and all those natural remedies that help some women did not help me at all because my doctor said that my nausea and vomiting was severe and needed medication.<br>  <br>  also try half a pill of unisom at night. try it for a few nights and it will build in your system and help ease the nausea and vomiting. again its safe to take and also some b6 vitamins...<br>  <br>  good news...by week 20 i was improved even without teh zofran. a nurse told me that the majority of the nausea would ease by 20 weeks when the pregnancy hormones start to subside a little. thats whats causeing you to feel so bad. you are sensitive to the high levels of hormones in your body right now...so hang in there. week 20 will be the start of you feeling better and being able to function without the miserable 24 hour sick feeling,<br>  <br>  and all this sickness is a sign of a heathy and strong pregnancy so hang in there. your little one will bring you both so much joy! i have vowed never to become pregnant again and i really think i mean it but i will do my best for this little one,<br>  <br>  good luck and congrats!<br>  there are good days ahead :)
66bc4129385331039e67c99220c312fcaa	I think it depends on if they are doing anything to earn the allowance or if it is just being given to them. If it is just being given to them, then not very much at all. If it is being earned then it should be based on what they are doing and how much they accomplish|`|vGxipYJnaa	It depends where you live. He's going to need more if you live in a city because things are generally more expensive (like going to the movies and transportation). Probably about $10 a week seems fair if he's doing chores.|`|QUgj0nb5aa	I'm almost 14 and I don't get allowance! If me and my sister wanted money, we had to keep our bedrooms clean all week, put away all clean clothes, and put all dirty ones straight into the hamper, make our beds every morning, do the dishes, finish all our homework and just generally show respect to everyone. If we did this every day then at the end of the week we would each get $5. But now my sister has a job, and my parents don't give us allowance anymore. But don't give him 10-15$, in the real world, adults have to work hard to earn their money, not just a little bit. The whole point of allowance is to learn that money doesn't grow off of trees, you have to work hard for it. Personally, I think allowance is stupid. When my parents were kids, they were expected to do those things without any backtalk for FREE, they were called chores! It taught them the values of hard work!|`|VXCfGX4caa	if you don't give him enough, he may resort to illegal methods to get his mj money|`|aDGcmvaMaa	Dont give him any money. Make him work for it. My mom never gave me any allowance and I got 25 cents for washing dishes and 10 cents for taking out the trash.|`|c1EPejxSaa	$10|`|aHBiVRShaa	I would say about $10/wk.  But make him work for it.  You could also break it down according to the chores he has.  $2 if he made his bed everyday that week.  $4 if he kept his things neat and not all over the house all week.  $1 if he took out the trash that week.  $3 if he did his own laundry....Break it down to whatever fits your lifestyle.|`|C61HaEzUaa	I think you should give a 14 year old boy a $15 dollar weekly allowance. im a 14 year old girl so you should trust me the only thing he will use the money for is probably for the movies or for when he's hanging out with his friends.|`|hdFSt0xNaa	about ￡10 every 2 weeks but ONLY if chores are being done.<br>  No one should ever get it for the sake of it, otherwise you'll end up with a spoilt brat :D
CJ3XHvIDaa	Look girl. I don't think you should get "rid" of the baby. Please don't do that! Bringing a baby into this world is really a beautiful thing. What I think you should do, instead of getting "rid" of the baby, is get rid of that boyfriend of yours!!! If he's capable of pulling his pants down, then he should be capable of dealing with the consequences. This baby did not ask to be born and I think you know in your heart what's the right thing to do. Please don't have an abortion. Later when you have this baby and you see that you can't do it, then think about adoption to a good family who will give him/her the best needs he/she deserves.<br>  <br>  As far as telling the parents! Try to contact a friend or counselor or anyone who could give you amazing advice and if not, try to find a shelter or a maternity home where they can help in case your parents decide to kick you out after telling them. You never know. Maybe they will give you all their support and you will never know unless you tell them but make sure to tell them in a safe place in case they try to hurt you. Try to bring a friend around, someone you know will help you in case something wrong occurs. You didn't state how old you were but I bet you're pretty young. I'm pretty young myself. I"m 19 but I was 18 when I found out and my whole world just fell apart when I found out. I didn't know what I was gonna do but I am sticking through it and im glad im here now. I"m due in May. Good Luck!!!|`|OPTDFRuzaa	Hi keep it! ts your choice and you will regret a termination. i could never live with myself. i am sorry but if your boyfriend is not willing to stick by you then he is not worth it. cut all ties with him he will only resent you if you try and make him want it. he may come round in time. Wait a couple weeks and then tell your parents its best coming from you. if your boyfriends the type to blab then tell them asap. good luck.|`|d89qNyb6aa	Try not to worry hun.<br>  Talk to your BF and tell him you do not want to get rid of the baby you and him made together.Get him involved as much as possible throughout the pregnancy so he KNOWS he's a big part in this.<br>  Talk to your mum and dad they can help you.Once they get over the shock ,they will be very supportive.<br>  Good Luck hun I am sure things will work out for the best.<br>  hugs to you,your boyfriend and your tiny baby xoxoxooxox|`|TZydDRJvaa	Get a job and try doing it on your own or go and get help from the state... anything that will help you thru the pregnancy...<br>  dont get rid of it because you will regret it && it will ruin ur life... as that baby inside of you is apart of you...<br>  you can keep the pregnancy away from ur parents until ur able to find a place... <br>  just stay strong|`|H5wyRZTNaa	In the end, all you may have is yourself...but if you get rid of that baby and you really want to keep it....it will be on your conscience forever. Abortion is murder so if you don't want the baby you should take care of it until it is born than give it up for adoption so a couple who can't have a baby may have the chance to take care of yours. Just think about the consequences of your actions before acting on them but also think about the baby.|`|WX5mDXgvaa	If you want to keep your baby the first thing you need to do is calm down.<br>  <br>  Then you need to seriously think long and hard about the implications of bringing a baby into the world alone will mean. Is is a financially and emotionally draining experience.. however it is the best thing at the same time.<br>  <br>  Only you can know if you are strong enough to do this yourself. No matter what your situation is there will always be help from someone.. this may come in the form of friends, relatives and the govement for funding. I don't know how old you are but you are never alone and I am sure you have some friends around you that can help you with this. <br>  <br>  Stay strong|`|qfgQDPIRaa	This is what happens when you have sex too young.  You should be ashamed of yourself.  Im not saying to get rid of it, but put it up for adoption and make sure it goes to a good home.  It is not a good environment for the baby to have a teen mother, with no transportation, source of income, or a home that is, if your parents kick you out.  Im only guessing your a teen mother but if your not do whatever you want.  Im NOT a troll, good luck.|`|XKhPdzKeaa	You poor thing. Have you got a best friend you can talk to about this? You may find it helps to know there is someone nearby on your side when you tell your parents. Telling your parents might not be as bad as you think, and it would be a weight off your mind. If you do decide to keep the baby there is a lot of help out there. Your local council could set you up with a flat and help out with supporting you and the baby. You have to think about what you want and what is best for the baby.

If you can't keep it please at least let someone adopt it.|`|sp29Lr0Raa	The answer to this is easier than you think. I'm 19 and I am currently 18 weeks pregnant. When I first found out I was in your EXACT situation. My parents didn't know and my bf didn't want me to keep it. The truth is, it's nobody's choice but your own. I seriously thought about giving it up, but I knew I could never live with myself if I did. I chose to keep it and my bf is ok with my decision now. It did take him a while, but he accepts it. After this I told my parents, and surprisingly, they were ok with it. Don't get me wrong, they were very upset and it wasn't easy, but they still accepted me! So make sure whatever choice you make you do what is going to make you happy. Think about what is the best for you and the baby, and everything will work out!

Your boyfriend is a no good loser who you don't need in your life. If anything give the baby up for adoption. What if the person down the street who you didn't know was trying for a baby for 5 years or more and finally found out she cant have one? What if that was you? Wouldn't you hope that some day someone will give a baby up for adoption so you could love it and raise it just like your own? Think about it.

46cd2ca02c07674e58e26d9c11367762aa	It sounds as though you were pregnant. You had enough HCG in your urine to show a positive test. Unfortunately, when you bled heavily and you had blood clots, I think you miscarried. Once you miscarried the HCG would decrease from  your body. If there wasn't any HCG left, the blood test would have come up negative. <br>  Im so sorry for your loss.|`|v3LnJycKaa	it means you most likely had a chemical pregnancy, and miscarried.|`|ds5MCdS5aa	Does it amaze anyone else on YA that almost all the pregnancy questions answer themselves? You are obviously not preggers hon.  That's why you get the blood test.  If you were clotting, and then the results came back negative, you probably lost the pregnancy......But again, you should be asking your Dr. and not the people on YA.....Good luck!|`|ze9Pah8Gaa	this happened to me twice, i found out i was pregnant on a urine test and went to the doctor to confirm it and my HCG numbers werent rising<br>  which means it stopped developing. A week later i started to bleed with lots of clotting. So twice i was only pregnant a week and this very early miscarriage is called a chemical miscarriage because technically you ARE pregnant but the fertilized egg does NOT implant, it does not develop and you miscarry.

There is a time to get things checked out, though, ask your doctor if you are ever worried about your child's development.|`|0dwVWzLJaa	sitting up on there own is around 6 months and crawling may never happen. i have a 10 month old who can sit up on his own stand up on his own holding the furniture and has taken a couple of steps but he refuses to crawl! lol all babies go at their own pace xx|`|6VbNJOtfaa	I would say between 6-8 months for crawling (average) and 4-6 months for sitting up well (average).  All babies are different, but I would say this the average age for both things.

Metoclopramide appears to sensitize tissues to the action of acetylcholine. It's antiemetic properties are the result of antagonism of central and peripheral dopamine receptors. Onset of action after a po dose is 30-60 minutes, with 85 % being excreted in the urine. It is 30 % protein bound with a high volume of distribution, indicating good tissue penetration.(2)<br>  <br>  Metoclopramide induces the release of prolactin from the anterior pituitary by blocking dopamine's action as an inhibitor of prolactin secretion, and causes a transient increase in circulating aldosterone levels. (2) Prolactin levels have been measured at 3-8 times normal within 1 hour of a po dose and can remain elevated for up to 8 hours. (3) <br>  <br>  [...]<br>  <br>  Milk supply usually increases within 2-4 days of starting the medication and pumping 6-8 times per 24 hours.<br>  <br>  It is essential the breasts be emptied, with a breastpump or by the infant, frequently and regularly, even at night. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/health/meds/prescript_galactagogue.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/health/meds/pres...</a><br>  There are several prescription drugs that have been used to increase milk supply: Metoclopramide (Reglan), Domperidone (Motilium), and sulpiride (Eglonyl, Dolmatil, Sulpitil, Sulparex, Equemote).<br>  <br>  The presence of an appropriate level of the hormone prolactin permits lactation to proceed normally. When a mother has low prolactin levels, milk supply may be affected. Prolactin levels are primarily regulated by inhibition: the presence of prolactin-inhibiting factors (dopamine is the principal one) keep prolactin levels in check. The drugs used for increasing milk supply work by blocking dopamine, which results in an increase in prolactin levels. These drugs do not work in all women and would not be expected to increase milk production in a woman who already has normal (high) prolactin levels.<br>  <br>  Reglan has often been used in the U.S.. One major side-effect of Reglan is severe depression; it is contraindicated in moms with a history of depression, and all moms who take this should keep an eye out for signs of depression. One of my sources advises all adoptive mothers to stay away from Reglan, since it has caused serious depression/anxiety in moms regardless of previous history. This depression side effect usually develops over 3-4 weeks, and goes away if mom discontinues the Reglan. Other side effects include diarrhea, sedation, gastric upset, nausea, seizures and extrapyramidal effects (twitching, etc.)|`|oehA2KMWaa	REGLAN  is an anti nausea medication. What does it have to do with milk supply? jw|`|3abc27d467d6cd664b8b7d1716054291aa	I never did use a prescription for my low milk supply because I had such good results with herbs. My favorite is Breastea (Breastea.com) simply because it worked for me and it was affordable. Before using Breastea I pump about 1 ounce (both breasts combined) and after I am able to pump between 4 to 5 ounces. Breastea worked pretty fast for me. I would try out the Reglan and just see how it works for you. Different products work for different moms, but the important thing is just increasing your milk supply and continuing breastfeeding.
f2801105f13387bb7dc143c4f514a260aa	This is a good question.<br>  The advice you gave her is what any other aunt would give to her niece..which is fine...<br>  I used to be picked on in Middle School and then the things this person was saying got a little old and it started sounding like a broken record...<br>  i delt with it long enough that the bully quit messing with me...<br>  If your niece's bully is saying mean and hurtful things to make her cry, tell her that she should just let some of the things go that are being argued about because in the end, she will know she did the right thing by letting it go. Maybe she should go to the principal or another teacher and explain her situation, if that doesnt help then tell her to ignore her.|`|RJDDC5Kgaa	Mixed martial arts.|`|PwHWJkcYaa	Ok, my 10 year old cousin had this problem, a girl was picking on her for being smarter and she couldn't tell her mum, becuase my aunt rarely 'hears' problems. I was also severely picked on throughout 7 years of school and college, by vicious cowards who are pathetic people I have now realised. <br>  When my cousin came with this problem, I didn't tell her to go to the school as I know from experience that this does f*** all. They ignore you and pretend to help, but actually do nothing. I went to the school myself on her behalf. This is something you could do, as a relative. I said something along the lines of 'Molly blah is picking on my cousin Ella Whatever, she is vicious in the playground, pinching, punching and pushing her over. She never allows Ella to speak in class and last week she threw all her schoolbooks in a puddle.' I listed the facts of what my cousin told me then asked the teacher what she was going to do about it. The head did nothing, so eventually I went to the girls parents. (Yes they are 40-odd and I am 19, but I am not taking anything from people of such a spiteful child.) I calmly told them what was going on and asked them to speak to their daughter. They did so, my cousin told me it was worse so I got the school and the childs parents together. This got her removed from the school for vicious, spiteful behaviour that went against the policy of the school. Her parents were pretty mad, but the short of it is, she no longer bothers my cousin and is at another school.<br>  Maybe this approach could be something you tried. I never threatened anyone, and was totally polite all the time, and managed to get something done legally without any rammifications. <br>  Hope it gets solved soon, I know how horrific it is to be bullied!|`|pMw4sGEFaa	Does she have some other friends to hang around with?  If so, tell her to play with them and to not speak to the girl who is causing problems until the disagreement is forgotten or blows over.  If she keeps harrassing her you might have her talk about it to the school counselor.  This is bullying and usually schools have a no bullying policy.  The counselor could probably settle the disagreement between the two.  Also you could let her teacher know about the situation,  so she's aware there's a problem.
SFNXSLumaa	you have to give it time, you only gave birth on the 22nd of feb! you need to wait about 6 weeks to start any ab excersise, otherwise you will end up with problems, possibly hernia! Just relax, enjoy your babies for 6 weeks, heal, get cleared by your doctor, and then you can excersice. I would recommend not to do anything yet, not even walking. you uterus hasn't even had time to fully contract yet, give it more time.|`|r9rzaNFAaa	You can not target fat loss. The key is diet diet and exercise.<br>  <br>  You need to eat 5-6 small meals a day. Eat some protein with each meal! Cut out all refined sugar!!! Also add more fiber. The fiber and protein will fill you up, helping you to cut down on your unhealthy eating. Also by eating more than 3 meals spread out through the day you will kick your metabolism in high gear. Here is a general meal for a day:<br>  <br>  Breakfast: 2 poached eggs<br>  whole wheat toast<br>  1/2 cup fruit<br>  <br>  Snack: Cottage Cheese with veggie<br>  <br>  Lunch: Turkey, lettuce, tomato, whole wheat bread sandwich<br>  1/2 cup fruit<br>  <br>  Snack: Protein Shake<br>  <br>  Dinner: Turkey Burger ( no bun )<br>  Side of brown rice<br>  Side of Broc.<br>  <br>  <br>  for the excercise part you caan try some of the tips here:<br>  <a href="http://stomachfat.notlong.com" rel="nofollow">http://stomachfat.notlong.com</a>|`|xWYKqcDjaa	Whoaaa! first of all, congrats on those babies :) <br>  <br>  But also, the ab lounger is probably not a good idea for right now. Since it hasn't been too long since you delivered, you don't want to put to much strain on your pelvic muscles and stuff. You should start with easier exercises. I have an exercise ball, and I love it..It doesn't hurt you at all and it works. Also, walking would probably be good for you right now, since its not intense.<br>  <br>  Good luck :)
af2136bcacd19dc5b2bab9b0737163c9aa	Every school is different most don't let you bring your backpack around because they don't want kids bringing weapons to the classrooms and what not.     each class lasts about 40min and after each class you get 5min to go to your locker and leave ur books from your last class and get the ones for your next. You're allowed to take your backpack to school but for the most part you leave that in you locker through out the day. Now, purses are fine to bring to classrooms for girls. It's not hard to do at all though I was really scared of that too after elementary school but i picked up on it fast. they have seesions to teach you how to open your locker and all and at my school when there was a new student they had another student help them for about the first week they would go get the new student out of class about 3min earlier than the rest and help you out with your locker and getting you to your next class they do that until you seem to know your way and what you're doing. I live in the suburbs of Chicago, Illinois and most schools here do this. good luck hun there's nothing to be scared of =)<br>  <br>  <br>  and don't be scared of people judging you, you'll see for yourself there are a million different ppl at the schools here everyone is different!|`|ZHhXQ0ebaa	most schools are diffrent in the US.. dont worry thogh.. the counslers at the school will give u a tour.. just ask them questions and they will help u.. good luck.. <br>  and dont worry about not fitting in.. just be ure self.. thats the best way to make frinds..|`|2QvIM81Haa	Well, I don't live in the U.S. but I bet Canada is pretty close to the U.S. with this one.<br>  <br>  Elementary :<br>  <br>  You stay in one class and usually have 1 teacher. There are sometimes lockers but usually a coat hanger to put your bad and your coat on. You keep your stuff in your desk and pull it out when you need it.<br>  <br>  Middle school :<br>  <br>  No idea, don't have them where I am.<br>  <br>  High school :<br>  <br>  Lockers. Lots of people  [Like me] Barely use their lockers and just carry around their backpacks with all their stuff for the day. Others, make trips to their lockers after every class to drop off / pick up w/e they need for the next class. Most people always have a backpack or tote or w/e with them.<br>  <br>  Scene thing :<br>  <br>  There are a lot of people everywhere who judge other people so you might get a few stares :(  Just be confident and proud! I bet there are some other scene kids in your school anyways.<br>  <br>  Good luck! :D
7a29609061cc85b8213f55d1598f7a9aaa	I haven;t heard the phrase but i imagine it means they are expected to be mature earlier<br>  <br>  no truth in it of course
oB8bbiwWaa	it is a gush of warm water - no big deal.  we got a waterproof mattress pad to save our bed in case it happened there.  it didn;t.<br>  <br>  have you tried surrounding and supporting yourself with pillows when you sleep?  it helped me.<br>  <br>  i hope you feel better and CONGRATULATIONS!<br>  <br>  edit:<br>  why the td? lol.|`|tQsxsuNPaa	lol!  I had the same thing when I was pregnant!  I was so worried that I might miscarry, or something awful would happen, like the baby wouldn't be 100% and all.  I SWORE it broke one morning when I was about the same time...I had an unusually heavy pee!  I took the day from work, and went to the doctor...called before hours and everything...she probably laughed about me with the nurses after I left...Nah.  But you'll know!  It's a big whoosh of water.  <br>  <br>  Best way to sleep?  Ask your doctor about the pain...but sleep on your side.  Left is better for the baby.  And it isn't unusual to have trouble sleeping at 8 months.  <br>  <br>  Good luck to you.  BTW.  My mother assured me that "All my grandbabies are beautiful."  And he is...he's almost 10, now.  It's going to be fine!  Hopefully, reminding yourself of that will get you through.  It's only about a month, now!|`|oojO4WAraa	You get a gush or a trickle of water - like you wet your pants.  Sometimes it is a rather large gush of water and it soaks your pants.  Just sleep in any position you find comfortable - and that gets harder to find as you get farther along. <br>  <br>  Good luck and congratulations.|`|JdyRdLwVaa	I know when my water broke..I was sleeping I woke up and got out of bed and I was leaking..I thought maybe the baby was pushing on my bladder again.But we went to the hospital just incase.And they did their strip est and it came back saying may water had broke.I had to be induced though my contractions weren't strong enough to start active labor.If you ever think your water breaks go to the hospital.|`|XhIYAH6Laa	Well my water broke with my first pregnancy....I sat up in bed and wham! To me it felt like you are peeing yourself really (I know TMI). The only difference is that it didn't stop, just slowing continued to leak.<br>  As far as comfort sleeping have you tried a body pillow, I personally have never used one,but I am told they are very comfy. Good Luck!|`|ddP3klT3aa	Usually it will leak. It smells fruity. If you go to the bathroom and your panties are wet, change your panties, wait 5 minutes, and if they are wet again already it is probably your water.<br>  If it gushes, you will know. Feels like you urinated on yourself.|`|90zcKChJaa	Some women's water breaks and liquid only leaks out, not a huge gush like in the movies. The doctor broke my water, so I didn't have to experience any embarrassing moments.<br>  <br>  It is best to sleep on the left side because of the major arteries on your right that could be pinched. It gets very uncomfortable to try to say only on your left, so try to prop yourself up a bit with either a pregancy pillow or just a couple more pillow. Try putting a pillow between your legs, that seemed to help me a bit.<br>  <br>  Best of wishes!|`|8Cvv86Jeaa	It feels like liquid coming out that you cant control. When you bend down or move it will kinda gush out more. (kinda gross sounding, sorry). Btw, after it breaks, that's not the end of it. I didn't know that. It keeps coming out until the baby is born and that is the most uncomfortable thing. I hated it. You wont feel it though if you get an epidural.<br>  As for the sleeping, you should sleep on your left side. If you sleep on your back it can lower the heartbeat of the baby and on the right you could slow blood flow. I slept on my tummy the whole time with one of my legs hiked up to take some pressure off my stomach. This position is safe as well. Put a pillow under your belly and between your legs. That may take some pressure off and allow you to sleep better. <br>  Hope I helped.|`|4ygxh6vNaa	If your anything like me you'll laugh, when my water broke it was like flood gates opening you cant really mistake it most times. And sometimes you can start having contractions before your water breaks so then your obgyn will break your water for you. Have you tried buying a pregnancy pillow they curve around your belly and make it more comfortable to sleep, my little guy used to shift to whatever side i wanted to sleep on. i bought one of those pillows and sleep like a baby.. no pun intented lol|`|GCTj1KDXaa	There are lots of unknowns when you are having a baby but don't worry, you will know what to do when the time comes. <br>  <br>  With my first baby I felt a pop and then a gush as my water broke - there was absolutely no mistaking what had happened! Contractions began about 5 minutes later. <br>  <br>  With my second son I had small contractions all day but my water did not break and was broken by the Dr just before giving birth at the hospital. <br>  <br>  Those babies keep us moms guessing. Good luck with the sleeping, it sure does get tough towards the end..  a few friends had some success with the body pillow or putting a pillow under your belly or between you knees may help. Best of luck!|`|BtxQogSzaa	In answer to you waters breaking, bleieve me you will know! it feels like you have wet yourself  but have no control! it just keeps flowing lol!<br>  <br>  And you other question about sleeping, i used feather pillows, one for under my tummy, one for my back and one for inbetween my knees...this should help a little bit, plus the pillow for you back is good for after you have the baby too...well i thought it helped :D<br>  <br>  good luck and i hope you get sleep soon|`|jBdvUQEXaa	When mine broke it was like I was peeing but couldnt stop then I sat down to actually have a pee and I DEFINATELY knew that they had gone!<br>  <br>  As far as sleeping goes, try a spare duvet rolled up like a swiss roll length ways, and kind of mold it into a shape that supports you and bump too!<br>  <br>  Claire|`|AA12113249	when my water broke with my first pregnancy, there was no question as to what it was.<br>  <br>  you will be fine, and remember sometimes your water never breaks.<br>  and that's fine too.|`|hVVALFAPaa	When your water breaks, you don't feel any pain or anything. You may or may not feel a pop but it does not hurt. The only thing you will probably feel is warm water. If you just get a small tear, it may be just a trickle. Your undergarments may just feel a bit damp, like you were sweating. However, most women's water do not break the way it always shows on tv. Most of the time, it breaks way into labor while mommy is in the hospital. My water never broke on its own. The doctor tore the sack while I was in the hospital in order to speed up my labors.<br>  <br>  As far as sleeping, there are no good positions at this point.This is what I was told:<br>  --Sleeping on your left will give better blood circulation to the baby, and possibly relieve heartburn. <br>  --Sleeping on your belly is almost impossible.<br>  --Sleeping on your back is not good for the baby (but you are asleep so how can you prevent yourself from flipping onto your back?)<br>  <br>  --Sleep with the head of your bed raised to help with congestion and heartburn.<br>  --Sleep with the foot of your bed raised to help with swollen feet....<br>  In other words, roll yourself up like a taco while on your side! (Ha!)<br>  Then just when you do get semi-comfortable, you have to get up to pee...<br>  <br>  Seriously, sleep however you can get the most comfortable. The best I could do was to sleep on my side with a small pillow under my belly to support it and another larger pillow between my knees to help with back problems.<br>  <br>  Sleep problems late in pregnancy are nature's way to get you ready for all of the sleepless nights you will have once the baby gets here.<br>  <br>  Hang in there-- only a few more weeks!
1fbde80871d870854ac254120d2640a9aa	I would just tell him, PLAIN and SIMPLE that there has been alot of viruses going around and you can't afford for your kids to get sick, so please COVER your mouth. Or you could get some lisol and spray it constantly after everytime touches something SURELY he would get the point! I make EVERYONE wash there hands before they can even touch my baby, some get offended but its my child if they don't like it then oh well! I'm sorry that you got sick. If just talking to them doesn't help you might have to be rude. Hope this helps!|`|KWJ7ju6qaa	Eww! Just tell them to cover their mouths, don't sugar coat it.  I tell complete strangers to cover their cough or sneeze, it's disgusting!!  <br>  <br>  Being polite, is not worth sacrificing your or your little one's health!|`|ddP3klT3aa	Your husband needs to have a sit down with them and tell them what is going on. He needs to tell them if they can not be polite in your house, they can't come over anymore.|`|3498yng4aa	If it were me...i would politely bring up their visit to them... and then mention to them that colds also cost money and say something to the fact that if they don't want to pay for the cost of the doctors visit and the medicine then maybe next time they will remember their manners and/or just stay away while they are ill.
SEzIkGNiaa	Very bad idea to be advertising over the internet, especially on yahoo answers.  Anyone can say they need a sitter and get your personal information, very dangerous!<br>  <br>  Try handing out flyers to neighbors/people you know with children.  If you don't know anyone with children, ask people if they know anyone that might need a sitter.  You could also advertise at your local chruch, dance studio, or grocery store.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|IrLVrdl2aa	You may also want to post on Craig's list under the child care heading for your area. I have also found that laundrymats are great places to advertise for child care. Make sure your advertisements are colorful, free of spelling errors, and provide contact information. Specify if you want them to come to your home, or if you want to babysit in their home. And know your rates. Will be be charging daily/hourly/weekly? What will you provide? What will they need to provide? What activities do you do with kids? How will you engage/interact with kids? (Games, books, outdoor play, cook together...) Do you have transportation? Can you pick children up from school? These are all questions parents will ask. :)<br>  <br>  Good luck!
oB8bbiwWaa	just make sure it is pastuerized.  i asked my doctor the same thing - i love that stuff!  yum - now I want some!|`|vKEYa8aeaa	it should say on the package whether it is from pastreurized milk or not, if it is then its safe to eat. most all cheese that you can buy in a regular grocery store are pasteurized. all the major brands are.|`|NPmRmnG6aa	If it is like from kraft than that is fine.

My sister in law just went through the same stuff, religiously avoiding all of the "warning" foods and drinks, and apparently the doctor laughed at her when she described the lengths she was going through to avoid the stuff.  My impression was that you shouldn't make a habit of the "warning" foods, but they are not incredibly dangerous.<br>  <br>  Of course, I'm not an MD, so insert a standard disclaimer here.|`|ysUqQ9Qkaa	The danger comes from moldy cheeses like Roqueforts that have mold as a feature of the cheese or Brie for example.  For a better list see my link in the sources.|`|AA10478980	Yes, you can eat the cheese.  If you check the package, it should say that the cheese is pastuerized.|`|BtxQogSzaa	yeah i think its safe...i didn't stop eating it when i was pregnant, its more like soft cheeses they say to avoid like cream cheese etc...so i wouldn't worry about it.<br>  enjoy your lunch|`|v1uNUcwCaa	yes you can definatly eat it<br>  and the pizza type...|`|CEKAqtB1aa	Yes|`|URZeQfQCaa	it wont do any harm.|`|SLph9RX6aa	yes|`|b073P2Wkaa	My answer may seem odd... first of all, as a general rule, you can have fresh mozzarella.<br>  <br>  However, most mozzarella comes from the Naples area in Italy, where the garbage crews have been on strike for quite some time now, in fact several months.  My mother-in-law is an endocrinologist and works with dietetics quite a bit.  She warned me, as I am 32 weeks pregnant, to avoid mozzarella.  It is not for listeria reasons but for pollution!  All of the garbage in the streets has been bad for the air quality which is leaving pollutants in the cheese!<br>  <br>  So, if you're only having a bit from time to time I'm sure there is no real harm being done.  You can check the package for the provenance of the cheese to put your mind at rest.<br>  <br>  Best of luck to you and congratulations!|`|2DYquT6caa	Yes, but you may want to be careful because cheese can make you constipated, and this is already a problem when you are pregnant.|`|If845eWeaa	the shredded cheese is the same as brick cheese and yes it is  not a soft cheese so you can eat it|`|Get4HnNKaa	the kind in a block is the same as shredded.|`|w10EYKrkaa	Yes its fine. x|`|83CvYAE8aa	yh think so dnt see why not
oB8bbiwWaa	get a new doctor - one who listens to you and your concerns without projecting his or her personal (and non-medical) beliefs on you.|`|AA11307468	Find another doctor.  Based on his response, he is not the type of doctor to give you the best treatment anyway.|`|V8GrFx0jaa	You absolutely need to dump your doctor. 24 is a very good age to have a baby when you're married. He will probably not take you seriously about endometriosis, either. No woman (or anybody) should see a doctor who doesn't make them comfortable and who doesn't listen to the patient. Ask around your friends and maybe your mom's friends to see if anyone can recommend somebody, especially a doctor with experience with endometriosis.<br>  <br>  The good news is that many women can have children with endometriosis, but it may take a little longer. If you really think this might be the cause, you must find a doc who can help you assess your options.|`|k4c24zblaa	Since I was 15 1/2 I've had problems my periods were irregular, I would have one maybe ever 3 months if that, I was tested for endometriosis but after the surgery they just told me that my ovaries were only slightly tilted, but would still be hard for me to conceieve. I was with my ex fiance for 3 years and we had unprotected sex pretty much the last 2 years of our relationship and I wasn't on any type of birth control and no baby we split up because he got another girl pregnant so I know it wasn't him that couldn't do the job. I got married in November and a week before I found out I was pregnant but it ended in a miscarriage a month later I was pregnant again now 13 weeks. So honey nothing is impossible, doctors will tell you anything and so many people believe them but usually when the doctor tells you, you can't have one it usually ends in a baby.. Just keep trying and take it from me, I was told the same thing and now i'm pregnant. And 24 isn't too early, keep your head up hun, everything will work out!|`|J2glFOkhaa	Oh my goodness! I cannot believe a doctor would speak to you that way. He has no right to deny you treatment based on your age, that is discrimination, and it is illegal. I cannot believe this! Srry, it just gets my blood boiling when I hear of doctors treating their patients with such disresepect!!<br>  <br>  On a bright note. I have endometriosis. I have had surgeries to remove masses of endometrioma from my abdomen. It has not beena fun ride for me. My husband and I were TTC for quite some time. I thought I was doomed. I brought up the topics of IVF, adoption, surrogacy, everything. <br>  <br>  Well guess what, I'm pregnant and due in September now. It took some time, but we didn't give up!!<br>  <br>  Good luck, and please don't give up. I also urge you to see a doctor, prefereably a specialist who can help you on your way. It can happen, I know first hand!|`|yB8djbeNaa	try a different doctor and keep bugging them until they send you for testing normally a laprascopy this is the only accurate way to diagnose endo,<br>   i suffered for 5 years before i finally got a doctor to listen and refer me for an laprascopy and i was right all along i do have endo and severe at that....<br>  <br>   it shouldnt matter weather you are trying for children or not if you have endo it need diagnosing and there is no cure at the moment only operations to temporeraly remove it. which you will need if you want children and havent succeeded within a year.... you will normally get one round of IVF aswell... (it depends what country you are in here in the Uk you get one round for free if you have endo).  If you do go for the laprascopy ask for a surgeon who specialisies in endo and knows what he is looking for, also get them to take a picture while they are there so you have something to show other doctors.<br>  <br>  If you are in the Uk then contact this person:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://keyholehysterectomy.co.uk/hysterectomy_endometriosis_recent_articles.html" rel="nofollow">http://keyholehysterectomy.co.uk/hystere...</a><br>  <br>  he is one of the UK's best endo specialist but you will need to have private medical insurance to use it unless you live in yorkshire i think it is|`|Fh4B88ZGaa	Find another doctor, preferrably a fertility specialist. There is no age restriction on fertlity treatment- you're over 18, you are entitled to care.|`|AA11783671	Go to a different doctor.  Have you had pain that's typically associated with endometriosis?  Any other signs?  I have it and have had four surgeries to deal with it.  One main thing that my doctor did before I tried to get pregnant was to shoot dye through the Fallopian tubes and watch on a screen to see if it was all clear.  Sometimes with endo, those tubes get clogged and the sperm can't get to the egg in time.  If you are really wanting a child, at 24 yrs old, I would find a doctor who was willing to help.  <br>  Also have you met with a gyno at all for a pre-pregnancy meeting?  We did this because of all my past girly problems, but found it extremely informative because there are so many things your body does to tell you when you are ovulating.  (Sticky discharge, etc)  It's certainly worth the time and effort.  Good luck to you!|`|nISjD0dHaa	I would definitly get another dr.  You are paying your dr for the care you recieve and he should be willing to listen and help you.  If you have been trying to a year that any fertility dr should help you.  First things first though I would tell the new dr that you have suspicions about endo and get checked for that as it could be the whole reason you have not been able to concieve.  My other suggestion to you would be to start charting your cycle now before getting a new dr.  I chart on fertility friends web site and it has helped tons with my fertility issues. Good Luck and I hope you get your bfp soon.|`|94eacd52d76b5f450c4b2099a14392d2aa	As pretty much everyone has said - you need to fire that doctor and get a new one. <br>  <br>  You don't mention if you have had any symptoms which might lead you to believe endometriosis is a possibility, beyond your not getting pregnant. If you have any reason to suspect endo, find a specialist!|`|YcwMK5Pbaa	Find a different doctor!! Do you know for sure that you have endo?<br>  <br>  My mother-in-law had/has endo... She started having kids when she was 20, and by the time she was 25 (with 3 kids), she tried for a 4th (for 7 years) and was unable to. Shortly after that she was in so much pain that she had to have a complete hysterectomy (sp).   I don't think you are in quite the same spot, but that is just to let you know that if you really want kids, and you may have endo, you really want to get on it, before it's too late.<br>  <br>  Good luck, and tons of baby dust for you!!!|`|xWYKqcDjaa	Your doctor has no right to tell you that. With the money your paying him, all he should do is answer any questions you have and get you tested. But also, it could be a problem with your partner,as well.<br>  <br>  My brother+sister-in-law tried for 3 years until she finally got pregnant... so sometimes it just takes time :)|`|6PEOqeLOaa	call your insurance company ask where else you can go that covers you. <br>  <br>  i would also call the doctors office and call and complain he really should not be able to say that to you.|`|eqkiNvoQaa	omg that is the same thing for me. insane,, i was gunna ask the same thing,, but the difference is i'm 19 and yea//
DN1K937raa	i also am having the same problem with my 6 year old son.   hes pretty much has been giving me a hard time since kindergarten.  only now that hes in first grade its got alot worse.   hes very shy. and has Extreme anxiety also.  when i pick him up at school.  and ask how his day is he'll say i'll tell u in the car.   cuz he hates talking in public and when i do try to get him to talk he looks around thinking people are staring at him.  im so confused cuz his sister is the complete opposite shes out going loud.  and loves people.  i've had a couple meetings with his teacher on how hes falling behind in school.  him not talking and being shy is affecting everything.  its hard.  but im hoping he'll grow out of it.  people tell me u should put him in sports but when i've tried he wont play the sport hes very stubborn.  all u can do is keep telling her its okay and she doesn't have to worry what other people think.  and just hope for the best.   good luck!|`|CxCigxZIaa	One word: perfectionist. <br>  She just wants to make sure she does everything right.|`|7oF2o4q5aa	Alert active children are the following:  perfectionists, stubborn, anxiety ridden, often seen as drama queens, don't like change, cannot stand certain textures so they may be a picky eater, only like certain types of clothing, or need a particular item to feel safe, will not do anything before they are good and ready BUT (here is the good news) they are very intelligent and clever.  If given enough time to wrap their minds around a subject (verbal, textural, and sight learners - often need to read about it, see the item or skill actually being performed, and get their hands on it) only then do they feel comfortable that they can do a project, perform a skill, or take a test.  I have struggled for years with my child being this way too.  There are books available about it (The Alert Active Child) that really help, too.  You just have to give them plenty of time to get prepared.  You could e-mail if you want and we could talk further.|`|hdFSt0xNaa	She didn't want to make herself look like an 'idiot' at this party because she has a clever mind. In other words, she feels it unnecessary to be Jumping around for no particular reason, on the other hand, when the gymnastics was for an achievment (winning etc..) she'll quite happily go for it.<br>  She's clever, thats all. <br>  Hope i've helped :D x
AA10478980	Start immediately leaving him for short periods of time with friends or family members.  If possible, take him to the day care frequently for visits so that he gets familiar with the location and the adults there.  If you start now leaving him for a while with others by the time he has to stay at the day care he will understand that you will be gone for just a little while and that you will be back for him.|`|d666c2be64ceba00657540ace50128e4aa	It's really hard the first week or so.  There really aren't any tricks to being prepared because it's such a big step and deal...especially to the Mommy/Parents.  Just focus on psyching yourself up for it...try to think of the many benefits that will come from going back to work and having him in daycare.  Make sure you're 100% confident with the daycare and take him to visit the daycare so you both can meet his teacher(s) and get a feel for the environment.   Also, whatever blanket (if he has one) he uses at home...get another just like it for him to go to daycare with.  It's something that will be familiar in this new place and can provide a sense of safety and comfort for him (I did this with my daughter when she started daycare and it seemed to help). <br>  <br>  I was lucky enough to have my daughter with me when I went back to work.  When she was about 7 months old I had to put her in daycare because she was so attached I couldn't answer my phone without her having a meltdown for my attention.  I had to wait two weeks for a spot to open for her and was nervous and anxious and all kinds of emotional about having someone else watching and caring for my baby.  I took her two Fridays in a row for the two weeks prior to her starting and we visited with the teachers.  I let them hold and play with her and we sat on the floor of the infant room and let her play with the little toys and things they had.  It was good to talk to the teachers and get comfortable in the environment.  They told me I could drop in whenever I wanted to on the Monday she started.  I think I called every hour on the hour to check on her for that entire first week.  The next week, Friday when I picked her up with all of her stuff they had laminated painted handprints from her!  I melted when I saw them and was so proud of her first project LOL.  It boosted my confidence in my decision making and definitely got easier from that point on...for both of us.  <br>  <br>  Now when I pick up my daughter from daycare, she runs to me with open arms and gives me the biggest hugs and tells me "MOMMY!!!  I love you soo much!" and it's awesome!  Do I feel I miss out on things...yea sometimes but she has learned so much and made great friends and I wouldn't change my decision for the world!<br>  <br>  Good luck and try not to stress too much about it...he can sense when Mommy is stressed.|`|ybexjS2Paa	My son started nursery when I he was 18 months old. I was afraid just as you about the separation anxiety. I talked to the nursery teachers and we did a little trick. For a month I was taking him there 2-3 times a week for only couple hours, increasing the time every week. So when actually I had to leave him the whole day for the first time he was fine. He missed me but there was no drama. I think I took it worse then him.|`|pzhnKxxGaa	take him to a mother and baby group where u can stay with him so that when he starts nursery he will b more confident around other children plus some of the children will most probably b attending the same nursery so friendships will have already been formed.

aac7c6d4d79683e9cae0fe6a541bbccdaa	There are a variety of options available to you.<br>  <br>  First, see if you can buy or borrow a projector.  I bought an old fashioned one from a school surplus sale for $10, but would love a digital.  You may be able to rent one.  Using the projector, you can project images onto the wall and stencil them in, and then paint.  If you do not want to do this directly onto the wall, purchase some blank canvas and do it on there and then hang them.<br>  <br>  Alternatively, you could hire someone to do a mural.  One of the churches we are associated with has a wonderful artist that does the most amazing murals-the VBS there is always so surreal.<br>  <br>  I am certain you can purchase wooden shapes for a lot less than $800.  Visit your local arts and crafts store.  A neat idea would be to have a lot of family members decorate one for the baby's nursery, and sign their name on the back.  Not only would it be helpful and fun, but a neat keepsake.<br>  <br>  You could use stuffed animals instead, but did you know stuffed animals can multiply?  LOL<br>  <br>  And, yes-you probably can find wall stickers.  Check Lowe's, Home Depot, Babies R Us, Wal Mart, etc...and the internet if you have no luck at those places.  eBay will have some.  How large you can find them, I do not know.<br>  <br>  Have fun!|`|jsdDgIuRaa	Why don't you just paint the walls a pretty color?  That way you won't spend a ton of money and you won't have to change it later and worry about getting glue off the wall.<br>  <br>  You could always buy some little animal pictures/paintings (like framed pictures) and hang them up on the walls.|`|Rhr1umV1aa	If you want stickers or something that you can hang out a wall you can go on the internet and find pictures of animals and print them out and take them somewhere to have them laminated and cut them out. That is what we did when we did our sons room with sports. We got gigantic size pics and laminated them. So they are like lifesize now to our 2 year old.|`|0vpDDM8aaa	go to a craft store (ac moore, michaels, etc.) a lot of times you can find wood cut outs like those...and they are MUCH cheaper than that....but you would have to paint them.  or you can try ebay for the product you want....also you can try walpaper cutouts.  its like sticky wallpaper but cut out into shapes.

d6df9c3bab13d4a609d4641b785de6b0aa	Yes, they can do a blood test to see what your HCG level is. That will give them a rough estimate on how far along you are. Then of course there is always the ultrasound. It is more accurate. They measure the baby to see how big it is, and can tell you when your due date is.|`|GxlkhRfoaa	They will do an ultrasound probably around 8 weeks pregnant.  As you dont remember when you had your period that should be soon.  Congrats!|`|LKIhUMCgaa	only an ultrasound, but to be correct it has to be done some time in 1st trimester. after first trimester, all babies starts growing differently and then it'll be hard to determine its' age by its' size, the ultra sound can be off by a week or so then.|`|rDPADat1aa	They can do an ultrasound to determine how far along you are.|`|iMY2fgYdaa	your doct will do an ultra sound on your first visit and they will tell you how far along you were.|`|wqL84O8Naa	yea, an ultrasound
cAtWxJG1aa	Two of my kids had chronic ear infections.  I never had a kid for whom amoxicillin cleared up the infection.  We'd go on amox first and then go back and get a prescription for something stronger, which would generally clear it up (don't know what other meds you've already tried since you say you've been to the dr. four times, but there are a lot of options and some are not in the penicillin family).  I imagine your doctor will likely do the same.  Some of the ear infection germs are resistant to some of the antibiotics.<br>  <br>  I can't tell you whether your son needs tubes or not, but I can tell you we opted against tubes despite occasionally having a longer-lasting infection like your son has had.  (Obviously there's some point at which we would have broken down and done tubes, but we always managed to clear it up eventually and my kids were not experiencing hearing loss).  All my kids grew out of their ear infections by age 3.|`|prqrQcd1aa	I'm going to ask you some really dumb questions here pertaining to how kids can get ear infections all the time!<br>  <br>  Does anyone smoke in the house?<br>  <br>  Do you keep your child slightly elevated when feeding him, or does he lay on his back when drinking a bottle?<br>  <br>  Do you clean out his inner ears with a q tip? (yes, this will sometimes cause ear infections in babies)<br>  <br>  I've got a suggestion that has worked on my own children... buy some garlic pills the kind that have the garlic oil in them..puncture the gel capsule and put some of it into the kid's ear, place a small cotton ball outside of the ear canal... make shure to give him his anti biotics as well and see if this ear infection doesn't just stop all together! Honestly at this point, i'd say it's worth a try...tubes in the ears at that age...you are going to be paying for a lot of tubes!|`|rjVALevtaa	Some children are just more prone to ear infections than others. It's something that he'll likely outgrow. Unless you smoke around him (which can cause ear infections and I'm assuming you don't do this) then there's really nothing you can do about it. <br>  <br>  I'm not sure about the tubes, you'd have to talk to your doctor about that.|`|DSLMxNN0aa	What really helps my family when they have ear infections is "Garlic and willow oil". You can get it at a health food store.  Your baby will smell like pizza, but it works every time.  Make sure you put drops in each ear with anything you give him, because if you don't the infection will go back and forth to each ear.  I hope this helps.|`|FvYqKZSMaa	Take him to the doctors and see what the doctor says.|`|yDWcYXl5aa	My great grandmother treated all of us with a simple, old fashioned remedy.  I've gotten the approval of several doctors, who merely said it wouldn't hurt, but it wouldn't help.  (but-it does).<br>  <br>  Take a fresh peach, take the seed out of it.  Break the pitt of the seed open, and inside is the actual seed, kind of shaped like an almond.  Take that part, and simmer it in a new popourri burner, in 2 tablespoons of sweet oil.  Simmer for about 4 minutes.<br>  <br>  Cool it down, and strain the grated seed parts out of it (daddy used to do that with a heavy papertowel inside a tea strainer).  <br>  <br>  When the stuff is completely cool, put a few drops in the ear daily for about a week.  Several of us grandkids avoided tubes, and I've saved about 14 kids from getting them because of this simple, old fashioned recipe.  Ask your doctor if it would hurt anything.  I had one doctor who called me for the recipe when he heard how good it worked.|`|pFZwO2xaaa	Tubes may be an option, but I would try to avoid it if possible.  Our son also had frequent ear infections.  His doctor suggested that we wait on getting tubes since he did not think he needed them.  He also suggested that the ear infections may hav been connected to sinus problems.  He put our son on a nebulizer, and this cleared up his sinuses ( runny nose, chest congestion, cough)  and to this day he has not had another ear infection.  This was two years ago.|`|1c74cc7ee9876780e94d288d920e0d0aaa	My daughter continued with ear infections from around the same age as your child up to around 3 when I found a good ENT( Ears, Nose, Throat doctor) who suggested tubes.  She had them in for about two years but as soon as they came out, another round of infections.  After her second set of tubes( which are now removed) she has had no other ear infection.<br>  <br>  <br>  I too am a constant hand washer and we do not smoke|`|e5CuEiPfaa	My daughter had sooo many ear infections before she was two. Then around one and a half, we got ear tubes put in her ears and she is now 3. She has only had 1 ear infections since then. <br>  If I were you, I would go with your gut feeling. Do you feel like you should get ear tubes for him? You will figure it out. Believe me, I know whats it like to have to take a child to the dr every other week for 6 months on end! I hope the little man gets to feeling better!
7bdhpvc9aa	It might just take time. Talk to the doctor if you even think that something may be wrong. Does your son put a little weight on his legs when held up right? If he doesn't then I would definitely talk to the doctor as soon as possible because your child could have low muscle tone. Not trying to scare you but having a baby who had low muscle tone I wouldn't take it lightly because it could be something more serious. Talk to the doc please please please if this is the case. <br>  Good Luck & God Bless|`|DIZKlxNraa	Don't worry! My son was the same... hated tummy time and then rolled over at 2.5 months and started practicing his tummy time on his own:). Also my baby didn't sit by himself till after he started crawling, which is the opposite of what other babies do. Every baby is different.|`|jN3pRKkEaa	I read that it is normal for most infants to be able to lift their head by 4-8 weeks and lift and turn their head shortly after they start just lifting it.  It does not sound like he is too far behind.  He might just be a little slow to develop which doesn't mean much.  You should ask his doc.|`|AA12008665	I'm not a parent, but why can't the baby just do things on his own? Why does he have to hit this 3 month milestone? Some babies don't do things "on time" like other babies do. Some babies just need to do things in their own time.|`|deIzFnV8aa	Don't stress, all babies do things at their own rate.<br>  But since you will stress no matter what we all say about it, here are a few ideas for helping him enjoy tummy time:<br>  <br>  Are you doing tummy time right after he eats?  Do something else for a half hour first, and be sure to burp him well after eating so a stray burp doesn't add to the spitup problem.<br>  <br>  Start with tummy time at an angle instead of flat, since this way he will have some help holding his head up. You can put him on your inclined chest or knees, for example.  This should also help put less pressure on his little tummy for spit up purposes.<br>  <br>  In a similar idea, prop him up by putting a boppy or a rolled blanket under his arms, so he has help.  Put things in front of him to look at.  A mirror is something many babies really enjoy - a crib mirror with toys is excellent, but any hand mirror is great, too.<br>  <br>  Do tummy time in ways that he needs to use his muscles just to hold his head flat - like flying him on your knees, or with your arms.<br>  <br>  Play "roll over" by letting him play on the floor on his back, then rolling him to his front just for very short periods of time before rolling him back<br>  <br>  Have tummy time chest to chest with you - less hard than the floor so maybe less spitup problems.<br>  <br>  Help him sit up, supporting his neck if he needs it.  This also builds neck muscles.|`|iAQKD2YBaa	Don't stress yourself too much about this as all babies reach their milestones at their own pace.<br>  <br>  My son was really bad at tummy time and i have to admit, I wasn't very big on giving it to him and guess what, he lifted his head, crawled, balanced and all the other stuff babies were doing at his age (and they had constant tummy time). Did our parents know about tummy time and did we do OK?)<br>  <br>  The one thing that I did do with my son was to put him up on my shoulder with his tummy on my tummy while sitting up, (his head was just above my shoulder and he was facing away from me), he then had to lift his head to be able to look around, I did this from day one. This also works his head muscles.<br>  <br>  Maybe try to give him tummy time before he eats as well.  <br>  <br>  Another thing is to put him on his tummy in front of a mirror or a favorite toy, you will find that if something interests him, he will manage to lift his head (Not sure if this will help with the vomiting though).<br>  <br>  Good luck, he will do it when you stop caring that he won't as all babies do !!!|`|JuWL7T0Haa	Don't rush your baby.  Those milestones are a guide it doesn't mean that every baby will be doing them by a certain age.  Each baby does things in their own time.  If they are seriously behind in their development and/or they have a problem with more than one skill than talk to the peditrician about your concerns.  Just keep practicing with him and don't get bummed out if he doesn't get it right away.  You can try pulling your baby up to a sitting position too that helps them learn to stablize their head but like I said don't rush it all.|`|cmS3pISvaa	Try not to overstress (I know it's hard being a new mom)!  Bring it up at his next doctor's appointment or give the office a call.  There is NO dumb question when it comes to your child.  I'm sure he'll be doing it in a few weeks... It really all depends on the baby.  My baby girl was holding her head up a few days after birth (but she was almost 10 pounds - kind of like a 2 month old)!  Keep up with the tummy time.  It will help build his strength.  As for his spitting up, try a different time of day or after an hour or so after he's eaten.  Good luck with your little one!|`|xLSb3XgCaa	thats normal <br>  babies dont really put  there head up untill 3 or 4 months<br>  but put down a blacket on the floor and put the baby on its belly and let it learn how to|`|cwNYmxDMaa	Still young, keep with the tummy time, try to entertain him while he's on his tummy.|`|GJgZVKvXaa	If your baby doesn't like/ doesn't get a lot of tummy time, he won't have a chance to develop the muscle strength he needs to hold his head up, roll, push up on his arms etc.  It's not a sign he's developmentally delayed, it's just he hasn't had a chance to learn.<br>  <br>  My son didn't like tummy time much and also spat up a lot.  You can work around the spit up, try putting him on a waterproof surface for tummy time.  When he spits up, just wipe it up and keep playing.  Or keep a cloth bib on him at all times and replace it when he spits up on it.  Or try doing tummy time right before a feeding, when his tummy is most empty and he's least likely to spit up.<br>  <br>  If your baby doesn't like tummy time you can lots of different things to make it more enjoyable for him.  My son really liked looking in a mirror or looking at things with bright patterns especially red.  If he has any toys he particularly likes (he's still little but he may already have a favorite), incorporate them into tummy time.  15 minutes twice a day at first is a good target to try for ... if he'll only do 5 minutes today, try for 6 tomorrow.  <br>  <br>  Once your son gets better muscle tone and learns he can control his body, he will like tummy time more.  My son used to scream when placed on his tummy, but when he learned to roll around 4 months we suddenly couldn't keep him on his back anymore.  Don't worry about the milestones too much, just work with your child the way he is and keep encouraging him to learn.
fYMWDQLGaa	Hi.. I was diagnosed with pcos before 6 months, i consulted doc and she gave me birth control pills. i took it for 6 months and then i am on TTC now. my doc said that first we will chk if i am ovulating on my own.    if not she will give me medicines to make me ovulate. <br>  <br>  I charted my basal body temp and found out that i ovulated exactly on 15 th day of my cycle , also i cross checked with OPK. so i think the best way is to consult you ob/gyn. definitely they have treatments for ppl lik us. Its not like we PCOSers cannot have baby at all.. we can have kids if we follow the medications, healthy diet, and weight. So dont you worry abt having kid, first consult a docwho might prescribe you provera kinda pills. that will induce ur periods.<br>  <br>  then they might give u BSpills or CLOMID whihc will make you ovulate, have sex every other day around the days u ovulate, im sure you will get pregnant in no time,<br>  <br>  goodluck and lots of baby dust to u....|`|S5n5Za78aa	your doctor should of discussed some medication with you to treat your pcos. When i was diagnosed my doc started me on meformin to treat my pcos cause you sound like you have irregular periods which is pretty common with pcos and your probobly not ovulating which will be the reason you cant get preggo but there is medication out there that can induce ovulation like CLOMID look this stuff up and if your doc doesnt inform you with this info  you should look into changing doctors .. good luck|`|chTCMyQ5aa	You need to go to your Ob and have them run some tests. Then they can give you clomid or metaphormin or both to make you ovulate.<br>  <br>  Also make sure your husband gets tested too, just to make sure his swimmers are good. It will save you lots of time and disappointments!|`|iMY2fgYdaa	I to had PCOS..I know that eating a healthy balanced diet and exercise will help alot. Losing as little as 10% of your wieght can help you regulate your hormones. I was on b/c pills for a year to get regulated then stopped them I had no periods after stopping the pill but got pregnant in 3 months. So don't stress and talk with your doctor. There are also medications out there to help with ovulation. so you have options yet...good luck<br>  here is a good website full of info<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.4woman.gov/faq/polycystic-ovary-syndrome.cfm#a" rel="nofollow">http://www.4woman.gov/faq/polycystic-ova...</a>|`|aGxbD6snaa	when i found out i had pcos they told me to go on the pill to regulate my periods then when i wanted a baby to stop taking it and see what happens. i didnt get round to it as i fell pregnant naturally straight away. its different for everyone. i didnt have periods for months and then by themselves they settled. remember to relax and not get stressed as thats one of the biggest reasons for your period not coming. it will happen just relax and let nature do its thing. good luck.|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	You probably need some medical intervention on that.  Prescriptions and what not...you can't just will on a period.|`|JYgJD0Rwaa	Its common not to have regular periods. That's PCOS!<br>  <br>  You can do two things... handle it naturally/herbally or take the meds the doctors give you.<br>  <br>  There are herbs like Vitex that regulate your hormones, which regulates your cycles, returns normal ovulation and restores your fertility.<br>  <br>  You can get progesterone from your doctor, you'll take it for 5-10 days and that will bring on a period, however it will do nothing to help control the PCOS. Nor will it regulate your hormones..its a band aid fix...a temporary fix.
j2mRop0laa	My husband and I have an unspoken agreement to never fight about chores or things to do with the kids. Since we don't fight about those things we are also very careful not to take advantage of each other. <br>  <br>  Maybe you need to ask him what he thinks he can do, happily, to help out? What things does he NOT mind? Is it laundry, dishes, bath time, story time, vacuuming, tidying, bed making, bathroom etc? What does he not mind doing daily? Ask him to pick 3 or 4 things that he can and will get done and promise to do without a fuss. Then tell him 3 or 4 things you will do without asking for help. <br>  Everything else.. either one of you will do *when you have time and the other doesn't*. <br>  <br>  I don't have any other advice but you aren't being too harsh because that would drive me crazy, too! What is he doing all day?|`|A7SJT50Kaa	what does he do? (not meant in a condescending way)<br>  i mean try to put yourself in his shoes. sit and talk w/ him. and then sit w/ him and mom and all 3 of you talk. set rules, expectations and boundaries.<br>  <br>  could he be depressed?|`|F6lZHRkVaa	I don't think you're being harsh, but I do think you're being unrealistic. He didn't help out at your last home, so you can't really expect him to change and help out at this home. One of the biggest mistakes we make in a marriage is expecting our spouse to change when our life circumstances change. It rarely works that way.|`|lkhCeAdJaa	I honestly don't think you are being harsh.  I honestly feel like if he wants to have a say in who spends more time with the little guy, who does more things with his family, then he needs to get his butt out of bed, take charge of the situation and be the man.<br>  <br>  Don't let this ruin your marriage.  Marriage is too important for 'little' things to ruin it, and this IS little because in 10 years it won't matter.<br>  Have a serious talk without arguing and complaining.  Tell him without accusation that you want hm to be more active in the daily happenings but you also find it easier not to nag an ask over and over again.  tell him you need him to step up and do things that need to be done WITHOUT being asked.  <br>  Do all this without any kind of bitterness in your voice.  then ask him what he needs.  Maybe he has opinions and thoughts that he hasn't shared with you.  Maybe he feels like you don't want/need him.<br>  Communication is so very important and when it is done without bitterness and arguing, it CAN and will help to work things out.<br>  Good luck|`|6VbNJOtfaa	Honestly, your husband is being lazy.  I have been in relationships with that lazy breed, as well.  Hopefully this is just a stage and he snap out of it.  <br>  <br>  In terms of your son going to daycare- mine does, too, even when his dad is off.  I can understand the feeling of not really trusting the father to do what he should.  What you really need to think about is if you want your life to continue like this.  You might need to sit him down and let him know what you are thinking.  But be careful, being unemployed he is feeling very vulnerable and worthless and you do not want him to think that you feel the same way about him.<br>  <br>  This is tough.  I venture to say that if I lost my job, I would have another within days.  But that's just me.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|8oAlBL91aa	You are not being harsh at all. Seems like he is milking this for all it is worth. He does need to get up and get a job 4 months is a long time with only one income and that has to be a lot of pressure on you. <br>  <br>  My husband on his days off will insist on "sleeping in" and I feel that if I can't sleep in then why should he we have things to do and places to go, rise at 7:30 and get my son ready for school just like you while he lays in bed, I always say I wish I could sleep in and you get him ready he will say well tomorrow you sleep while I get him ready well today is tomorrow in that case and guess what I'm not asleep! He says I'm so tired I said well then go to bed at a respectable hour he says I fell asleep at midnight well I fell asleep at 10 and I feel good so why don't you do that also, right. I hate to see what is going to happen when this baby comes because I'm sure as hell no going to do it on my own all night long he says he will help I will believe it when I see it.|`|CugCzH9iaa	You are NOT being too harsh! <br>  <br>   You could try this...ask him ONCE to help out in the mornings, if he does not get up then let your mother help.  He might see it as your mom stepping on his turf and get upset and start getting up!  Where right now all he thinks about is that you are "bugging" him.  If that does not work I'd set him down (when he is NOT half asleep and cranky) and talk to him.  Explain to him that he wanted to be the one to help over your mother but when you ask him he ignores you.  Tell him you feel taken advantage of because right now you are having to do it all.|`|PTdy6TWRaa	You're not being harsh. What you want is fair and reasonable but whatever you're trying to do to motivate him clearly isn't working.  Sit down with him and create a schedule of responsibilities that you can share together. Once you both agree to some routines then try to stick to them without complaining. If he can't follow through on something he agrees to like that then you have bigger problems that may need a third party to help mediate.|`|eF6HTt0gaa	No your definatly not being harsh, sounds to me like your husband is depressed he can no longer help provide what he use to for the family so hes really withdrawn himself from everything.And I know thats not what you want to hear but from this side it sure looks like it. Keep asking him daily if he found a potental job and if not tell him not to give up , praise him when he tries. Just keep in mind your all stressed about moving in together, not having a job, of possibly needing a new one. We do what we have to survive and its not always pretty.  I wish you all best of luck and I hope for everyones sake he gets outta this funk but remember he needs time and patience from you. Hugs|`|ge3meKYEaa	Seriously, sounds like you would do better without him......  right now he is just a load.<br>  <br>  I don't know- if he was my husband we would be working at Burger King or Walmart until he could find a better job.  <br>  <br>  I tell him get work or get out- but I won't have put up for it for 4 months....  AND anyone who say that well he didn't help out before- that's BULL because he was working before so he should be doing eveything he can to help out in that house of find another job.|`|jLYTKr33aa	No, you aren't being too harsh at all.  I don't want to offend you, but your husband is lazy.  He's not working, yet you have to do everything when it comes to taking care of your son AND go to work?  That's not right at all.  The parent who's home more is the one who should help the most with the children.  It doesn't matter if that parent is Mom or Dad - if you're home, you do the majority of the housework/childcare.  He should at the very least get your son up, get him ready, pack his lunch, and have him ready for when you leave for work.  He could go a little further and bring your son to daycare.  Better yet, since he's home all day, he could take care of your son during the day to save money on daycare.  <br>  It's time to have a serious talk with him, because the way he's treating you isn't fair.  Good luck.<br>  *ETA*  I definitely agree with your decision to send your son to daycare.  You're right that he comes first, and you have to put him in the environment that will best support his development.  It's just sad that Daddy can't get it together and do it himself.  Hang in there.|`|prqrQcd1aa	Honestly NO, you aren't being too harsh. Your husband is not doing what he should be doing. He needs to get off of his lazy azz and help out, especially if he is not working and you are! He would not be very happy if he was the one working and you were the one doing all of this stuff now would he.<br>  <br>  You know I have a boyfriend that yeah i've known for like 19 years, but i have 3 kids that aren't his.. He works and tells me to stay home with the kids, and he STILL helps out around the house where ever he can, and on his days off lets me sleep in and helps to take care of the kids!<br>  We aren't even married yet but we work as a team in all areas!<br>  <br>  I suggest you sit down with your husband and talk to him about all of these things. Maybe write him a list of all the things that you do around the house, with the kids, and at work compared to what he is doing around the house, with the kids, etc. This may show him exactly what you are talking about. Let him think you are nagging him... this is just being an adult and taking care of your responsibilities at home. Yes, times are hard now days, but that is no excuse to just sit on your laurels and do nothing about it!|`|mtMmhIDcaa	I don't think you are. Your husband should do his part of the share to support the family.|`|nFE6T6Hgaa	I think you need to have a serious talk with him and tell him that if he's not doing anything but sleeping all day for one he could get out of the bed and help you get your child ready. Also if he's not working why don't you leave your son there and have him watch him to save money? He could drop him off at daycare when he goes out looking for a job instead of him being at daycare while you husband sleeps. I find it frustrating to that men say "all you have to do is ask". My husband will help if I ask but sometime I just want him to take the initiative and do it. It's not hard to tell when I;m stressed when I'm cooking and holding my son while trying to help my daughter with homework and do my own work stuff! Men just don't get it. Maybe you should suggest marital counseling. Good luck!|`|60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	You are NOT being too harsh!!!<br>  <br>  I'm hoping (and thinking) he will get bothered by your mother helping and realize that he needs to be doing more.  When my husband was in Iraq, I called my dad for all kinds of things/ help.  I had a bad habit of doing it after my husband got back home.  Let's just say he didn't like that.  It was offensive to him but I didn't realize it at the time.  Hopefully your husband will feel the same way soon and step up to do his part.  <br>  <br>  On the daycare thing... I've been meaning to tell you this.... If you don't want to offend him w/ your reasons, just remind him of the waiting list your son would have to be on to get back into his daycare when your husband does find a job.  My husband was unemployed for 3 months after he got out of the army and it was the same situation.  No one could understand why I kept paying for and taking my son to daycare.  The waiting list is a factor, especially when you have a great provider.  But, I'd make sure and remind your husband of that so that it's not insulting on his part... if you catch my drift.  ; )<br>  <br>  Good luck!!!!|`|cAtWxJG1aa	just an answer from my experience, which may or may not be relevant to you.  my brother was diagnosed with cancer a few years ago.  the treatments were brutal enough that he became unable to work.  while they were ultimately successful, he then fell into a serious depression that lasted over a year.  he was unable to look for work, unable to do simple housework, unable often to drag himself off the couch for any reason whatsoever.  i know there were times during that period when his wife felt the way you are feeling.  but it was not laziness; it was clinical depression.  despite her frustration, she stood by him and dragged him to doctors' appointments and got him some help.  it took time and patience, but he totally turned around and is back to his normal, energetic, helpful self.  <br>  <br>  i obviously can't say whether your husband is clinically depressed or not.  but it does sound rather like it, and would be a shame to end a marriage over a treatable illness.  depression often looks to people on the outside like laziness and lack of motivation.  and many people do get depressed when they've been out of work.  you might want to consider getting him evaluated by a doctor.
eXsR8Gx5aa	Silent reflux is acid reflux with sometimes no obvious outward symptoms - it could well be that she is bringing up a little acid or it could be perfectly normal.<br>  <br>  Things to look out for with silent reflux include . . . <br>  <br>  Frequent hiccups<br>  excessive drooling<br>  fussiness over feeding<br>  weight loss/ poor weight gain/ failure to thrive<br>  anaemia (iron deficeincy)<br>  A preference to sleep prone (on the tummy)|`|4X6MwQJRaa	My 5 week old daughter has silent reflux.  She cries (or should I say screams) in pain usually after feeding and takes a while to settle.  She often coughs and gags but is not sick.  However she does tend to spit out mucus which smells acidic.  She chews on her fists constantly and makes a lot of noise .. lol.  She refuses her bottle sometimes even though I know she is hungry (apparently because they associate feeding with being in pain) and does not sleep well.  I have found sleeping her on her tummy in the day when I can keep an eye on her helps her.  Also raising the end of the cot/moses basket so she is not laid completely flat helps.  <br>  <br>  We took her to the dr who prescribed infant gaviscon which did not work for her but I have heard good things about it from others.  We then got some zantac from the dr which is supposed to reduce the production of acid in the stomach.  Unfortunately this gave her diarrhoea so we have had to stop that too (not doing too well, poor girl).  Luckily she seems to be a little better now.<br>  <br>  I would suggest popping to your dr if she is uncomfortable. <br>  <br>  Hope you sort it .. I can sympathise!|`|2f337410fbe0d9b903a0453f45d050c9aa	baby does that sometimes, my baby did that when she was younger.<br>  and silent reflux will cause pain, if she's not crying or in pain, its okay, its not silent reflux.<br>  but make sure if she's not choking or anything, try to elevate the bed a little bit or make her sleep on her side.<br>  Good luck!
IfKTQME0aa	You aren't being too protective.  Its normal to feel like this.  Of course, I say that because I did the same thing.  I sterilized everything UNTIL my daughter started rolling and I found her licking the wood floor.  After that, I saw that she was going to be exposed to germs with her growing independence.  When other kids (especially sick ones) come around and you can't avoid it just have them wash their hands (even if the adults roll their eyes) and keep the baby away from close contact with them.  My daughter is 17 months old and I still use the cart cover during fall and winter months when I put her in the shopping cart and I thinks its helped reduce colds.  One more note, I heard vicks may cause breathing difficulties in young babies so google that if you have to ever use it....not sure if I remembered correctly.|`|q4rG5Dwtaa	Yeah I'm the same way, I have three kids and I'm the same way with all of them. I hated when their older cousins would come over and they would kiss all over them and they all had runny noses, even just wondering where they put their hands before they touch the baby.  When I go to the doctors office I make sure the kids stay right by me and I don't let them play with the toys in the office because I'm so scared they pick something up. Your not alone.|`|Vl7trXXraa	I don't blame you. End of the day, when your baby is sick you have to look after her 3 in the morning. I would do the same meaning I wouldn't wash my hands 50 times but I wouldn't let any kids touch my baby especially if they are sick.|`|fyA4uL6Taa	Not really..well to a certain extend..I mean yeah dont let her be around sick people.But they need to experince germs to be able to fight them.My 15 month old has only been sick twice so far.Neither were that bad.|`|FIRfaDkGaa	xx|`|qfvqOHnyaa	dont have one|`|HGqmsaM5aa	Umm I do wash my hands before i make bottles and at other normal times of the day. I don't see the need to be neurotic as I know that being that way doesn't help their immune systems! I had my daughter in november. Nobody in the family with flu shots and up to this date no one has gotten sick. I even bring my daughter to play groups! I am careful with sick people touching her but i'm not crazy about it. On the other hand my sister was the way you are and her son was constantly sick! We also have pets and we show her to pet nicely, but wash her hands afterwards.|`|yo9XNz61aa	Im not overly protective but I dont have my guard down either.... she does not sleep at night with a blanket and sleeps only on her back (im very very cautoious of SIDS and follow the exact guidlines in preventing it)  My house is clean its but it does get messy and I dont sanitize it like a hospital but its not filthy....its good for babies to come in contact with some germs.  My daughter is 2 months and never had a cold.  I keep my house temp on 72 just as the doc says and its comfy for everyone.  I do ask visitors or anyone at that to wash their hands before handling my daughter b/c I dont now where they have been!|`|ZYlr9TSBaa	I'm protective to an extent. My house isn't completely germ free, but I did wash my hands before touching her when I was ill because I didn't want her getting ill. I don't like strangers touching her when i'm out, it freaks me out because who knows what germs they have on them,|`|CVdcrY3kaa	I'm protective of her when it comes to certain things. My house is clean, but I figure she'll come in contact with germs one way or another so I don't sterilize every little thing she comes in contact with. I definitely don't like it when children with snot hanging out of their noses want to touch her though, that's one thing that drives me crazy! I'm lucky though, she hasn't' been sick yet *knocks on wood*|`|b10aMPdOaa	I'm also protective, with both my children.  My daughter who is 14 hates me being so protective.  It's just one of those things a mum is.|`|GGBDkOuFaa	I was like that too, but you will get over it.  I washed my hands and used sanitizer so much it looked like I had lobster claws!|`|DNygQdmVaa	I am pretty protective.<br>  my son was a preemie, and I cant deal with him being re hospitalized.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	If your obsession with hygiene is effecting your quality of life, or if you have certain rituals you must preform in order to feel calm or in control then you probably have obsessive compulsive disorder -which is very common post-partum.  Post-partum OCD generally responds very well, and very quickly to treatment which doesn't always involve medication.<br>  <br>  Don't let this impact your ability to enjoy your life, your baby, and your husband's (I assume) child.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pregnancy-info.net/postpartum_obsessive_compulsive_disorder.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.pregnancy-info.net/postpartum...</a><br>   The main difference between PPOCD and the obsessive-compulsive disorder that affects the general population is that women who develop the disorder in the postpartum period tend to focus their obsessive thoughts on their baby. While women with this disorder may be prone to bizarre thoughts, they are acutely aware of the fact that their feelings are not normal. However, some women with the disorder are reluctant to seek help for fear that they will be looked down upon for their peculiar thoughts and fears.<br>  <br>  Symptoms of Postpartum Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder<br>  Typical symptoms of PPOCD cause disruptions in a woman’s daily routine and can get in the way of her personal relationships. The rituals that many women establish to cope and deal with their obsessive thoughts can be time consuming and interfere with regular activities. Signs of postpartum obsessive-compulsive disorder include:<br>  <br>      * Intrusive, recurrent and obsessive thoughts, usually involving the baby<br>      * Avoidance behavior, possibly of the baby but generally anything that will cause fear<br>      * Establishing rituals which include:<br>            o Repetitive behavior (touching every door knob you pass)<br>            o Obsessive cleaning and/or washing<br>            o Hoarding (done to combat fear of losing objects<br>      * Anxiety and/or depression<br>      * Fear <br>  <br>  Women affected by PPOCD usually experience obsessive thoughts about their baby coming to harm. This can result in repetitive behavior such as repeatedly sterilizing the baby’s bottle for fear that it may be contaminated or checking on the child an excessive number of times. Some women may also harbor fears that they will harm their child in some way, such as drowning the child during bath time. However, while these fears can be especially disturbing, very few mothers with this particular disorder are likely to actually cause themselves or their child any harm. <br>  <br>  [...]<br>  <br>   Getting Treatment<br>  It is important that women affected by PPOCD seek professional help. Left untreated, PPOCD can impede a woman’s ability to cope as well as interfere in her relationship with her partner, family, friends and child.<br>  <br>  There are different treatment options available to women with PPOCD. Some may be treated with anti-obsession medications. Other may receive the medication in combination with other forms of treatment or may not receive any medication at all.<br>  <br>  Another treatment approach uses psychology to help women. Through different types of counseling, including couples therapy, support groups, interpersonal therapy and cognitive behavior therapy, women are able to change their behavior and the way in which they act. This helps them gain control over their PPOCD.<br>  <br>  The final form of therapy takes a social approach to the issue. Through this treatment, women are able to learn coping strategies. Additionally, because this approach involves a woman’s partner, family and friends, she is able to build a network of social support.<br>  <br>  Because of the different treatment approaches, it is possible for each woman to have a very personalized therapy that will be the most beneficial to her. With proper care and treatment, it is possible for a woman to overcome this disorder. <br>  <br>  -------------<br>  Postpartum OCD Story from Grace Unbound<br>  <a href="http://postpartumprogress.typepad.com/weblog/2008/04/postpartum-ocd-story-grace.html" rel="nofollow">http://postpartumprogress.typepad.com/we...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Postpartum Obsessive Compulsive Disorder<br>  When Worrying About a New Baby Crosses the Mental Health Line<br>  <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Health/story?id=117022&page=1" rel="nofollow">http://abcnews.go.com/Health/story?id=11...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.drphil.com/articles/article/220" rel="nofollow">http://www.drphil.com/articles/article/2...</a><br>  Acknowledging the research of Dr. Michael Jenike and Ronald Kessler, Ph.D., of Harvard Medical School, Dr. Phil offers the following advice and information.<br>  <br>  # You don't need to conquer this alone. Dr. Phil recommends you see a cognitive therapist, a counselor who treats thoughts as behaviors.<br>  <br>  # A cognitive therapist may introduce you to "exposure and response prevention." With this approach, a person is deliberately and voluntarily exposed to whatever triggers the obsessive thoughts, and then is taught techniques to avoid performing the compulsive rituals and to deal with the anxiety.

SNVauR3laa	This is a tough one. I went back to work when she was six weeks old. I had an extra 20 ounces frozen for the sitter. For the first few weeks, my daughter would drink 16 ounces while I was at work. 16! Mind you, I nursed her at the babysitters just before I left for work, and as soon as I got back too. <br>  I think that it was in part due to her anxiety about being somewhere new. She tapered down to 12, then by about 5-6 months old, she was down to 8, which is where we are now - she is 10 months. <br>  <br>  The good thing is, for the most part, my body has been right on. In the beginning, I was pumping three times a day, and getting 14-16 ounces. Now I pump twice, and get about 8. Your body will keep up, but all babies are different.|`|nuBRcuwvaa	I went back to work at 10 weeks and started pumping around 8 or 9 weeks.  It is hard to pump and nurse back and forth though, so I didn't have too much of a back up supply... maybe 8 bottles of milk when I started to work.  It was a little nerve wracking at first, but then I realized that I made plenty of milk as long as I pumped every 3 hours.<br>  <br>  My bottles only ever had 4-5 ounces in them at first.  Then as the months went on, I started to keep about 6 ounces, and then towards the end of my breastfeeding days (5 months) I got up to 8 ounces in a bottle.  Sometimes he wouldn't finish that though... <br>  <br>  I always sent 1 extra bottle than my son actually needed to daycare each day because in case the 4-5 ounces wasn't enough for a certain feed, they could warm up a second bottle.  Each day at work I made about 3-4 bottles which was just enough to keep up with him.  Then I could nurse at night and right away in the morning.<br>  <br>  The weekends were a bit tricky because my son preferred the bottle, so I kept pumping during the day... that helped me keep a good supply ready for the following week.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|T0gv52CDaa	I started pumping at around two months, and I went back to work at 3 1/2 months.  I have around 75 bags of milk in the freezer, and I try my best to pump enough each day to replace what will be coming out of the freezer for the next day.  I've been leaving three 5 oz bottles for my husband who is home with our son now, and he says that at 4 months, our son is drinking one every two hours when awake.  On days that he doesn't nap well, my husband has to dig into the freezer stash to keep him satisfied.<br>  <br>  Now that I'm back to work, on week days I pump first thing in the morning before my son wakes up, and twice at work and usually get about 16 oz. a day, but some days I don't get quite that much.  On weekends, I still get up early to pump before my son wakes up because the morning pump is when I get the most milk.  After the morning pumping, I feed him up until it is time for me to leave for work, so that my husband wont need to feed him again for a couple of hours at least.<br>  <br>  You may want to start stocking up by either pumping before she wakes up, or pumping on one side while she nurses on the other.|`|FLpMShKNaa	I had at least 15 oz. saved up, but it was way more than I needed-once your away from your baby you'll pump a lot more. My son started out taking 3oz. at daycare and nursed a lot at night. The most he ever took was 6-8 oz. in a day. I used a medela pump in style advanced, I always had to pump more than I needed to relieve the pressure.|`|GGBDkOuFaa	I only had 6 oz in the freezer.  I would just pump and then use that for the next day.  As long as you have a good supply you will be fine with only a couple ounces.  And if you notice your supply getting lower from pumping you can try fenugreek. It works great!
vVofB4DPaa	Hell, I'll medicate my kids just so I can get a nap !|`|AA11109728	I don't like just handing out medicine, so if I give it to my daughter it's because she really needs it.  I'll use Tylenol for a fever or for 'growing pains' in her legs if they are bothering her so much that she starts crying.  I also give her cough medicine when she has a cold and is stuffed up and is coughing a lot.  If she's at the point where she's coughing so much from stuff in her throat that she's starting to gag, I'll give it to her, especially at night when it gets worse because otherwise she can't sleep.  I'll use that and put her humidifier on and it quiets her coughs.  Other than that, we don't usually have any other use for medicines.|`|zRQmWC5saa	If he has a fever then he needs to tough it out unless it gets past 103 then u can give tylenol. fever is ur friend and alot pf ppl think it is the enmy. a fever is just letting u know it is fighting off what ever is making ur child ill. of course it isn't comfortable to have a fever but the best u can do is pamper them and give them cold stuff and wash their body with a warm damp cloth. if he needs meds for other reasons such as an ear infection  or something in that nature then wait a day or 2 b/c sometimes things clear up in a day or 2 on their own. taking antibotics each time u get sick can make ur body reject it for a serious illness.|`|AA12145826	Depends on what's going on. Fevers, headaches, etc. anything I can treat with a single dose of Motrin, yes I'll give medicine for. Ear infections are kind of the same way. With the traditional "cold medicines" for kids being shown to cause heart problems, we use more homeopathic remedies like eucalyptus oil, humidifiers, Vick's vapor rub, chicken noodle soup, etc.|`|yhrqIjAeaa	My son is two now and we just had his first real sickness.  I gave him tylenol and motrin to take down his fever, but followed his doctor's advise of rest and lost of fluids.  He's much better now and I feel good knowing that I didn't give him unnecessary antibiotics.  Of course if in the future he needs them, I am all for giving them, but this time he was able to work it own on his own without any.|`|rpsXPdFmaa	My husband, a doctor, would have my head on a platter if I refused medicine to our child.  He doesn't believe in toughing it out if there's medicine around to help.|`|O97ZoHGXaa	All the basic medication such as paracetamol, ibuprofen etc have zero side effects on the person taking them. There for, why would anyone chose to put their child in unnecessary pain or discomfort.|`|iu4SOin3aa	Im the same way you are.<br>  I give my son whatever medicine he needs to make hime feel better, but I never take anything myself no matter how sick or hurt i am.<br>  <br>  Why is this?|`|AA11537580	I only give my daughter medication if she needs it. She was almost 4 before she even had a prescription filled.|`|85vDqn6naa	I do give my kids certain meds for certain things, i cant stand to see them hurting!|`|cAtWxJG1aa	I'm not a fan of "toughing it out."  I'll give them medicine where it will help (albuterol for asthma attacks, antibiotics for a persistent ear infection, motrin for the killer headache) and otherwise I don't (we don't, for example, give otc cough medicines, which generally don't do better in testing than placebo for effectiveness).|`|EtCRnDJMaa	I will only give them a pain/fever reducer type a thing.  Never a cold or cough medicine cause i don't think they work.  Just the pain/fever medicine.   and i don't run to the doctor for every little thing.  If they have a cold they'll be fine and get better, if they have a fever i give them a fever reducer and send them to bed.  If they have an ear ache I give them a pain reducer.  The only time i take them to the doctor is for their yearly and flu shots|`|G2auAv1Saa	I've only taken medicine twice in my life- whatever knocked me out while I had my gall bladder taken out, and the local anesthetic when I had my eposoitomy. <br>  My daughter has only taken medicine once when she was about a year old she had an ear infection- amoxycillin. <br>  <br>  I think the more you medicate yourself the weaken your immune system is the less you are able to tolerate natural levels of pain or discomfort. <br>  So far this is true the ear infection is the only time my daughter has ever gone to the doctor for anything other than a checkup and has never had the flu or a cold (and shes in daycare). <br>  I am also rarely sick- once every 10 years maybe.|`|hKJIDdVqaa	I do give my children medicine for pain, and/or an antibiotic upon a dr's recommendation.  My children are very rarely sick, so I usually have no problem.  I tend to lean more towards holistic or natural medication.  But would never deny my child of a dr. or medication.  My kids play sports heavily-football, baseball, basketball-so they experience muscle pains and bruising more than anything.  For that I use menthol bath salts.|`|bYhqPOtwaa	My son is 2 years old and we don't give him medicine for sniffles, runny nose, minor cough, or slight fever.<br>  <br>  However, if he has a high fever, bad cough, ear ache, then we will give him the appropriate medicine.|`|AA11210211	I do sometimes depending on what ailments they have.My daughter is teething right now and I am always giving her tylenol whenever I notice discomfort in her,I can't stand to see my children in pain:(|`|wiAVa1H5aa	I hate doing it but we have too.   I resist pain relievers for any reason really, I think giving pain relief for teething may interfere with tooth and jaw development (they can slow bone growth), and we know cough syrups are pretty useless so that's out, as is a lot of other meds.   However, since my boys have asthma and allergies they use a nebulizer on a regular basis, and the oldest has to take Zyrtec until July too.   Sucks a$$, I have sick kids and we have worked hard to keep them well.|`|NuUdCz0Laa	With a small medical background (paramedic) and my wife in pre-med, we tend to administer medicine as soon as illnesses come up.  I find it much easier than playing the waiting game, which usually ends up getting worse.  By the way, I have two at home sick today, but my wife was able to take off work this time, so I know they are getting treated well.|`|eu6UQElYaa	For me it really depends on the illness.  I don't really like medicating my kids up for minor things like slight head colds etc. but if they are really miserable or obviously if it's something that absolutely requires medication in order for them to get well then yes, I'll give them medicine.|`|j2mRop0laa	I try to give them something at night if being sick will keep them up. Nothing worse than being so tired but unable to sleep and tossing and turning, trying to get rest. It's awful!<br>  <br>  I had a rant on it last night, actually:<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AkiWR1aZNBpsT8_5G6Gs1uPsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090303181442AArlGhu">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <br>  I don't care if my kids don't want to take stuff during the day, but they need sleep!|`|5DJzp6bMaa	Depends on if There is a Fever Involved, If Their Temp is up Its Foolish  Not give them Something for it|`|T864ejaiaa	i give my kids meds and take them to the dr's. what a strange question.|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	yes I give meds... he's got eczema is incredibly itchy right now so I relieve him a bit with benedryl.|`|prqrQcd1aa	It depends on what is going on with the child honestly. If they are seriously ill or have an ear infection then yes, I'd medicate them. But if they are sick and just need some extra fluids and extra sleep then no, i don't medicate them... Unless it gets pretty bad. (example: up all night coughing) I try to use all home remedies that I know first and then if the problem doesn't go away on it's own, or they get bad, I take them to the doctor's office.<br>  My kids don't usually get sick though. My kids are 7, 3 and 1. The youngest is the only one that has ever been on anti biotics for an ear infection. The other ones have never had one!<br>  If they have a fever I'lll try a lukewarm bath first, if that doesn't solve the problem (which it normally does for my kids, then I will give them some Motrin) If they are in pain then yes I'lll give it to them then as well.
6igjX2cnaa	Hey hun! I pray that you hear the heartbeat :)  It's sooo very wonderful!  I got to see my lil one and the heartbeat.  So very cool!  I was told that after my 6 1/2 week appt. that I will get an appt. every 4 weeks for the first 4 months.  Then every 2 weeks for months 5-7, then every week there after.  Good luck with everything hun!!  This info is what the nurse told me, I meet my OB on March 26th.|`|oA8Rtyxuaa	9 weeks, 12 weeks, 16 weeks, 20 weeks (usually this is when you get an ultrasound and see the gender if the baby if the baby is in the right position and you want to find out), after that i think it was like 24, 28 (glucose test), 32, 34, 36, 38... i was in there every week after 30 weeks for non stress tests though so im not sure if the last few are accurate and this was about 4 years ago! Congrats :)|`|Bw1h5xAcaa	You are usually seen every month or 4 weeks up until you are 30-32 weeks, then you are seen every two weeks until 36 weeks, then weekly until delivery (and more often if necessary or for additional appointments such as for ultrasounds).
j2mRop0laa	When my kids are out of the house with families of their own, you'll find me at some secluded beach front house, about 30 minute drive to nightlife. :)<br>  <br>  Oh, yeah.. can I toss in Fancy Clothes, too? I think I want some of that....|`|764563e236641925edbeefe032c813b3aa	My two children are 10yrs old and 5mo old and I'm 32, so fast forwarding 20yrs, I will be in my early 50s. I don't see my husband and me living in either one of those situations. I've lived in the city all my life and he's a military brat who was raised in the suburbs. Therefore, I love the city and would want to live in a nearby suburb but not the city itself. I think he would agree- half heartedly, tho.<br>  <br>  Where ever we live, we'll be doing a great deal of traveling because by 50, I will have enough time under my belt as a federal employee to retire but be young enough to venture into something else. We're neither fast paced nor relaxed country and I doubt we'd be that way by the time our youngest is on her own.|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	i've always lived the country life, can't imagine it different.  i actually hope we are still in this exact spot, maybe a better house, but this land where i can open my windows and smell the clean air and hear the birdies and watch the stars in the sky.  perfect place for the grandkids to come and play.|`|MVgm17o3aa	I have a 3 yr old son and a 11 yr old daughter and raising my kids does not stop at 18 yrs like the law allows...i will raise my kids and help them until the day i die! I do hope to travel some when the time permits and see what i can afford too and be a wonderful grandparent|`|IPl3Yh1kaa	Well, I already live in the city where there is plenty of fine dining and fancy clothes going on already lol. And I plan on staying here even after my little man grows up. I might move to Paris france, another city. But i'm a city girl through and through!|`|NuvKPl3naa	as far as snotty noses and "raising" kids i have 14 more years. but as you know you are a parent forever. and once you think you are free here comes the grandkids. :)|`|4PK0hiWeaa	No kids yet so than future is still up in the air.|`|F6lZHRkVaa	Are those really my only two options?|`|qSmCA82Aaa	I actually dont think I will ever be 'done' with having kids around ---At least I hope not.  I am very close with my mom and she watches my children while I work everyday so that is what I want when I get older.  I would like for my children to live close and I want to watch my grandkids everyday.  I love children, I always have I couldn't imagine life without them.    But to really answer your question.  I'm a country girl.  No city life for me.  It's nice to shop and visit but at the end of the day I want quite and comfort! : )  kinda like that country song...Don't know the name of it though.  It goes something like:    Everybody knows everybody,  everybody calls you friend, you dont need an invitation--kick of your shoes  come on in.  We know how to work and we know how to play...We're from the country and we like it that way!   <br>  <br>  LOL!  Seriously though I love my small town Everyone waves every where you go and it's just such a nice place!|`|6VbNJOtfaa	I would love to return to the city; I will probably go back to Phoenix or a suburb.  It is so beautiful there (it snowed here in WA yesterday) and the night life is so nice.  We left, however, because we knew that it was no place to raise a child.  While I am sure there are parents there who are doing a great job, there are just SO many drugs, prostitutes, crime, illegals who are criminals, etc etc.  <br>  <br>  It would be nice to get dressed up and go the theatre with my significant other, or be able to go on trips and not have to cater entirely to the boy.  Wow, good question, but it is so far off (my first is 12 months) that I cannot even think that far ahead.  I am pretty sure I have dinner planned for tonight, and that's about where my future stops lol!|`|XPnCeJ29aa	I cant ever picture myself being in the country.<br>  I do enjoy camping so I do enjoy the peacefulness but not to live.<br>  <br>  I live in a city, not sure if its a fast paced city, but there is a corner store on every block and a dunkin donuts on every other block.<br>  Store plazas on every main road, which are every 1/8 mile.|`|iyLV1CADaa	I will be done in seven years, but then there is college. So, I won't really be done. <br>  <br>  I already did the city thing and the NYC people were not friendly enough for me. I will probably stay in the west. Although my fantasy is of living in a beach front property and scuba diving every day. <br>  <br>  One thing that I found to be really exciting is reading magazines from a university library. When you read through 100 magazine covers, a handful of things pop out as being of interest. I develop interests that otherwise I never would  have thought about. One was the tar sands of British Columbia.|`|s6emVQleaa	Country road outside the city.  It's what I love about the area I live in.  There is still a lot of country areas around but you are in close proximity to a fairly large city.  It's the best of both worlds.  My husband would love to move me out the the country country, but I like to shop to much to agree to it.|`|4mSpN3Rxaa	id say about 15years or sooner. my daughter is 5, but then i think of grandkids, its a cycle that im afraid will never end. hopefully my children will be responsible enough to take care of their own kids. it would be nice to be alone with my husband one day. we have 4 kids. we had 3 kids automatically when we got married so there was really no us time. hes from Fla. but i dont want to end up there. i would rather live in Alabama, Tennessee or Georgia where we already live. I LOVE living in the country! I want a nice country house with a porch wrapping around it in the woods on a dirt road one day!|`|nZVmkZSBaa	My daughter isn't born yet... And I'm still really young. I would probably continue having more kids until I'm a lot old --- maybe 10 or 15 years from now !! L0l. So, 15 years, and another 18. =/ <br>  Aha. I don't know. But I don't think I want another baby for a couple more years. Far too young... :)|`|rjVALevtaa	Ten years in the future...my boys will be 10 and 14. Most likely I will be done having children. Hopefully be in a bigger city (we live in a very small country town right now). I will probably be done with college and hopefully have a steady job.|`|WirFwirLaa	My husband and I always have said we'll retire to Tenneessee (we live in Ohio) He loves the mountains and has always loved the state and im just sure by that time I will be ready for a change of  scenery!|`|pT7jrsAgaa	In my daydream world, we are headed to the mountains!!

I don't want to have all the business around me after I'm done raising my kids...

I envision my husband and I living in the country on some acreage growing our own produce and fruit from our own trees and doing a seasonal "come and pick your own" produce.<br>  <br>  I also see my self starting that Christian based pregnancy resource center here in my home town that will serve this and surrounding counties.  It's going to be non-profit, donation based.  My husband plans on running his own auto-shop or restoring classic cars.<br>  <br>  Our life will be slowed paced and savored like a good juicy T-bone steak!|`|TQW5E6olaa	Lets see, Bella will be in college. I'll still be living by the beach (only closer) preferably near WLA. I like that area better, perhaps Malibu. I need a city, even if it is Los Angeles. I'd love to be doing the web-based thing and traveling frequently.<br>  <br>  I've never experienced "country" but I may have to do some research since ya'll are so attached to it...|`|cAtWxJG1aa	oh, that's easy.  country.  get me too far away from trees for more than a short time and i start getting stressed out.|`|VwMkiLFPaa	Country....where my biggest worry is if a moose is coming my way. <br>  <br>  Never been much of a city girl! :)
jG8b3Mz0aa	My daughter is always laughing whether it be at me, my husband, her brother or the cat. She's always cracking up. Sometimes she'll start laughing at purely inappropriate times but hearing her laugh does lighten my mood. The sound of laughing children is glorious.|`|7X0zAd9kaa	Laughter to kids is extremely important especially during the 1st 3 years of life.  When they see you laughing it makes them in a good mood and laugh also.  This also helps with their social skills, and expressive skills in their brain development.  The way you act around your children is how they will react back.  Try to laugh more often or have the children around a happy environment.<br>  <br>  Good luck and I hope this helps.  =)<br>  <br>  Have a happy, laughing day!|`|prqrQcd1aa	My children and I are just like you. If we aren't laughing then something is wrong. Now, i'm not going to laugh all the time when i'm sick but seeing someone else laughing even when i'm sick will make me have a better day!|`|j2mRop0laa	Exactly the same here. If I see a cranky mood coming on I try to think of something funny real fast. It almost always works. Except with my youngest, sometimes, she'll laugh then be like "Hey.. wait a minute.. I was mad about something..." LOL|`|s4LWmcTjaa	You know.... it's the same for us too.  If we don't laugh, then we tend to have more of a bad mood.  Laughter is a great medicine :)<br>  <br>  Laughter is very important to us and our family!|`|SnQvsOPwaa	Very   Just like it's important to most people.
be8738c7b3a936fc2e865b3f0e6ad7d4aa	I just read about something like this! I had an ultrasound at 14 weeks and I thought I saw boy parts, so I was convinced it was another boy. <br>  <br>  Until..<br>  <br>  I found this website that showed ultrasound pics that have girl babies who appear to have boy parts at the 10-14 week stage! <br>  <br>  Boys and girls have the same "parts" until closer to 20 weeks and the difference of the angle can be used to predict the gender. <br>  <br>  Here is the website:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.baby2see.com/gender/external_genitals.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.baby2see.com/gender/external_...</a>|`|2B2fgmw9aa	nope, never heard of it, you are better off just waiting until the ultrasound at 18-20 weeks.
j6UNd6yMaa	yes. it can be caused my stress or lack of rest.. your heart will need to produce more blood to cater the need of your active body..|`|sdtqTbmoaa	stress easily raises your bp|`|dQ4XwT95aa	High blood pressure can be caused by many things, but I would keep a really close check on it. Sometimes it is just due to your heart having to pump for two now instead of one.|`|OTvymEWGaa	stress, excess salt.
YHUk1jTMaa	if its not over the cervix you should be ok for a vaginal birth. with a low lying placenta there might be a little bit more bleeding at the birth but not enough to be worried about. like a teaspoon full. If you are only 29weeks it is WAY to early  to be scheduling a c-section for term. The placenta can still move away from your cervix as you uterus gets larger!|`|rAD0mL7Saa	don't start panicking yet. You'll most probably be fine in labour, and your midwives will watch you very closely for bleeding, so just relax. You might not need a c-section. Secondly, a lot of placentas are low lying at this stage and move up as your uterus expands, so it's really rare that it's a problem.|`|QP46eVi4aa	i had a very low one to the point of they was wanting a c-section but at the last day or 2 moved jus anoth i went in dilated to 6 2 hours later i was holding my little girl natural no pain meds|`|115I5Polaa	I had a low lying placenta but it resolved at about 25 or so weeks, I gave birth vaginally.  How far along are you?   Good luck!
fdnbXfvfaa	I don't approve of anyone using a paddle for discipline.<br>  I don't know why anyone would send their child to a school that does that either|`|7HKTDcvYaa	Only if a court has tried the case and ordered corporal punishment. Otherwise this is  assault and battery.<br>  <br>  The principal may feel she is doing some good, but she has no legal right to act as judge, defense attorney, and jailer.<br>  <br>  We should be teaching kids to respect each others rights, including their own. A blatant violation of someones right to due process should not, ever, be part of  that process. Assault on a child is never justified even as punishment for assault on a child, unless a court of competent authority deems it necessary, and there has been a right  of appeal specified.|`|xekNv16maa	absolutely not!<br>  <br>  if anything was used like that on my child in school i'd be livid.<br>  <br>  if my son is misbehaving, i expect the teacher to dicipline him, within reason, and he will also be diciplined by me when he gets home.|`|s4LWmcTjaa	No and neither do schools.  Use your brain please :)<br>  <br>  And even if there are schools that still do paddlings, the parents have to sign a consent form.|`|4e67Pdfvaa	I am the only one allowed to spank my children, and i certanly wouldn't use a paddle!

A lot of you didn't even answer the question, you just went on an anti-spanker tirade.|`|y9TUWrjIaa	People have children because they have sex. Unprotected sex usually causes pregnancy. Parenting is learned. If you are brought up in a dysfunctional home, more than likely you will raise your child as you have been raised. It becomes a vicious cycle and one that must be broken if you wish to raise a healthy ( mentally, physically and emotionally ) child. Having a child does not automatically make you a good parent  any more than having a knife makes you a brain surgeon.Some people are just not meant to be parents.|`|T864ejaiaa	some kids are hard headed. they like to push the parents button until the parent has had enough. i don't know who your referring to, but the best thing you can do is stay out of it. my mom stuck her nose in my little sisters business about raising her kids. my sister will not talk to any one in the family now. it's been like this for 20 years now. her eldest is 25. i have two other nieces i have never seen. all because grandma couldn't mind her own business. god bless you and i hope you can find peace with the person your upset with.<br>  <br>  if the child is being marked up then you can do something.|`|prqrQcd1aa	Judging by what others have written, and what I'vee heard.. I'm thinking you are maybe a lot like my own "grandma" who is schizophrenic and agoraphobic!<br>  <br>  Let me add in here that not everyone hits their children, but I'd say 99.9 % of parents have hollered at their children before. Parents (the good kind at least) do not constantly yell at their kids!|`|T9fek24eaa	LOL you really think that spanking leads to people that like S&M? WTF! <br>  <br>  ROTFLMFAO! That is the most ridiculous thing I have heard... were you by chance spanked as a kid? If so what are you into?<br>  <br>  Oh yeah... sorry a real answer to your question... I am with a few of the other ppl, if you tell me you never yelled at your kids, I am going to call you a liar. Kids needs discipline and sitting down and talking to them and not punishing them does not do it! Spanking and beating are 2 different things... get a life.|`|SlBsJ3NRaa	I'm contantly yelling, but love my children very much. You can only say "get down" or "stop drawing on the wall" so many times beore you lose your patience.|`|fdnbXfvfaa	Because they are better parents then you!|`|s4LWmcTjaa	Are you going to tell me you've never lost your cool with your kids?  If you did, I call you a liar right here and now.<br>  <br>  <br>  And also, corrective spanking and abusive hitting are two different things.  Please don't confuse the two and label everything as abuse.  <br>  <br>  By your standards, putting my child in time out will turn him  anti-social and breast feeding is sexual abuse on a baby.|`|EtCRnDJMaa	i really don't think they intentionally do it.  sometimes kids can get the best of you and some people don't know how to handle the stress or don't have the money to seek professional help to get the right medication they need or parenting classes or counseling they need.  <br>  <br>  Sometimes all you need to do is think about the question before you go off and assume things! or make an a$$ out of yourself granny
Ki6jlwnbaa	Try setting up activities which will keep the devil child occupied. Something where you are watching them, but aren't watching over them.<br>  <br>  <br>  edit- and you are not wrong for feeling this way but to save the drama i think you'd be better off just inviting them.|`|45nSn7Rcaa	It it was me in your situation I would take control of the situation.  That child would not behave like that in my presence or to my children.  If the parents do not watnt ot raise thier kid up right thats their problem, but when that bad parenting affects me and my children I am not going to accept it.  I would tell that child how to behave and have no  problem disciplining him.|`|waz8ONEEaa	seeing how i was raised, i'd say that boy needs the sh!t knocked out of him at least once.<br>  <br>  of course, 75% of every kind of "punishment" i got as a kid when i acted that horrible (the FEW times) is probably considered child abuse these days.<br>  <br>  then again, you don't hear about many school shootings from my age group.. its the one right after when that started.<br>  <br>  no discipline as a child = even worse teenager.<br>  <br>  just read the news, its all there.|`|hKJIDdVqaa	birthday parties for kids are just that, for kids.  Nix the adults and family members, have the kids invite friends only.  We eliminated family birthday parties a while ago. They are just too much work.  It is amazing 20 little preteen boys are much less work that their adult counterparts.
gTjtaG0Faa	Just pick out some items at Babies R Us tell her that you have a list available at the store (one big item stroller, crib, changing table) then some smaller "extra" items like toys, crib sets things you think are nice but might not spend the money on like matching curtains (find a cute full set wall paper, decos sheets pillows blankets ect), then add diapers, wipes, bottles, blankets or cloths.<br>  <br>  Its obvious that SHE wants to shop there so let her everyone else that asks can get you items at Target which I agree is a much better priced shop for what you get.<br>  <br>  Ps I know that she might be annoying but if she wants to buy you these items you should let her, I would have loved to have this type of help instead I got a 50 year old crib that I had to fix to make it safe.<br>  Put the money you save into a special account either for babies college or maybe a fun family vacation.|`|5X6C4s7zaa	Don't you love in-laws!! lol, no but seriously they seem like they have the right intentions though so I would just kinda suck it up and register at Babies r Us and get rid of your Amazon.com registry.  Most people probably wouldn't want to buy from Amazon anyway.  Something this minor isn't worth aggravating yourself, your MIL and your Hubby.  Good Luck and Congrats on your bundle of joy!|`|4XfjUcvDaa	Personally I think that Babies R Us is over priced as well.... BUT  whatever is not purchased on your registry you will get a discount on in the end, before your due date.  I also registered there because I figured it was easier to have everyone go to one store, and figured with the discount it was worth it in the end.|`|mc6YtaRbaa	I'm with you on the registry thing. I like people to buy me stuff, but I don't like to make them and I feel that when I register I'm making them. I did my registry between Babies R Us and Walmart because no one has any money to buy stuff right now so I wanted to make sure I went somewhere cheap too.|`|mBfvthNaaa	I share your feelings about registries.  Keep the peace, register at Babies r us.  Just make sure that you cover a wide range of prices with the gifts you choose.|`|xpstigPTaa	I would just regsiter at Babies R Us and keep the peace. It's not that big of a deal. Best of luck.|`|AA11085356	I guess if I were you, I would set up another registry to make her happy. You don't have to go all out and put everything on there, though. Maybe a few outfits that you like and a few other things like bedding, or around the home kind of things. You are right though, 2 is enough. But she's just trying to be nice, and think of everyone who would be shopping for you. And since this is your first baby, there will be plenty left over after the shower that you and your husband will be able to buy for yourself. Good luck, and congrats!!|`|seU9VwIJaa	I'd just go ahead and throw some cute over priced stuff from Babies r Us on your registry. I didn't believe it at first, but people really DO want to shop there! I think they're either living vicariously or perhaps just get more into baby mode when they're in there. <br>  <br>  It seems like they're really excited and care about you and their grandchild a lot! I'll trade you in-laws! Although we didn't financially need the shower, I would have felt honored if my mother in law offered to throw a shower. My best friends threw mine for me. <br>  <br>  Congrats and good luck!!!|`|jMtEtSR6aa	I will tell you from my own experience, Registries are a big waste of time. I registered at every store that had a baby registry and I did not get one thing off any of those registries. I registered at Babies R US, Walmart, Target, Amazon, Kohl's.. you name it I was registered there. I would stick your gun, if they want to buy you something from Babies R US, they will without a registry.Congrats and Good luck with your new baby!!|`|wKuQC4yTaa	i registered at babys r us and they gave me a gift card just for registering:) not much but will buy maybe a couple diapers...lol. but they do have a good selection of stuff there.  A lot better than target, the other only place i registered.  I think 2 is fine. i only registered at one place for my wedding. im not to big into that stuff either.  A friend of mine made a good point. you can get cheaper stuff later on. but if people are willing to buy the higher end stuff, let them|`|CKnHMYHnaa	I wouldn't.  You gave people two options and that should suffice.  If they want to go to babies r us, then they are free to do so and pick up a cute outfit or something.  A lot of people don't buy from the registry anyway, so you may just be wasting your time.  Say you don't feel up to registering again- you can get away with it in a pregnancy.|`|AA11779376	I think you should go ahead and do it. They are trying to be nice and they want the baby to have a lot! I think it sounds wonderful. I know registering is a pain but just think of all the cute little things your baby could have. Or suggest to MIL that if people were to pick out things they liked it wouldn't bother you any.|`|qdFrJ21waa	The two you registered at are fine. What's wrong with target? It's just as fun to shop in the baby section there as it is at Babies-R-Us. They carry practically the same stuff anyway. I think 3 places is a bit much, especially since you weren't keen on doing any in the first place. She'll get over it...Target is a perfectly fine substitute.|`|B2w5MwjXaa	trust me, it is not worth arguing with her. just register at babies r us (which i agree is over priced) and keep the peace.  then you can just get her out of your hair!|`|oDlDrjF1aa	i would just do it you can get more stuff for the baby u wont have to buy even if u can afford it a baby is exspensive so take all the help u can get|`|DZzBfzVeaa	Ya I agree with the first person, just go along for now and register there also. If they want to buy you stuff then just let them and be nice.|`|faPKwClPaa	I don't know what your MIL means that people "want" to shop at Babies R Us, but I wonder if SHE feels that way because, well, the place obviously caters to babies.<br>  <br>  But so does Target and amazon -- and for a heck of a lot less.  Maybe try explaining that to her.  That, and lots of people register at those places for weddings, showers, etc.  <br>  <br>  I would stick to your guns on this.  You've set up two registries -- that's God's plenty.<br>  <br>  Besides, um, get used to having to put your foot down.  'Excited' generally translates to 'interfering' or 'overbearing', so it's best to start that training now. ;-)|`|T48smu01aa	I don't see what the problem is with your places but just to keep the peace i guess I would register at babies r us. I registered there first and then everyone kept asking where did you register (mostly family) and then everyone kept saying why don't you register at wal-mart and target ha ha people rather would shop there than babies r us......I even compared some stuff and babies r us is over priced.....But hey Its frustrating but don't worry it will be over soon:)<br>  Congrats and good luck!!!|`|NPmRmnG6aa	I think that 2 registries is more than enough. Babies r us has almost all the same things that target has. If people really want to shop there, they will even if you do not have a registry there. I only have one since there is not like you need 2 of everything. your registries are not forcing people to shop at the stores you have them set at. They can shop where ever they want to.|`|Axcy1DYlaa	I would register there just to keep the peace. Register for small things like crib sheets, receiving blankets.. maybe some clothes. That way she can't be upset that you didnt, and you're keeping the peace. <br>  <br>  Best of luck!!!!!! Congrats! :)|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	I'd get rid of the amazon.com one and do babies r us... she's right. people will mainly shop at babies r us might as well get what you want right?
5HbQ8RFBaa	no, not a good idea|`|MW1yrHbOaa	no|`|1s3nddaYaa	i would.. but im not|`|tSEA42Uraa	No! Not at all! I hate it when parents give children names that sound similar, or start with the same letter. It's horrible, and shows you think of them as part of a set, and not as individual human beings.|`|eWCMPZL2aa	no, they both sound like boy names. <br>  Jessa and Jayden would be cooler. <br>  i would name my kids that...when i get older to have kids lmao xD|`|zeTGmB3faa	They are both nice names. I didn't choose those for my children, but if you like them, why not!|`|423983e632cb60a59de566f2b6c70711aa	No.|`|GZn5VNlSaa	Joseph yeah (but too common)<br>  Josey no (too biblical sounding)|`|3AfQ9UXYaa	No. They're individuals so I would give them different names.|`|wzmo2Ju7aa	Absolutely not. Even if they were twins, those names are much too much alike.|`|dXRrxxrFaa	Definetly not!|`|yXGlmUqlaa	no. they're too similar|`|Y3DR1EBUaa	No|`|o4NRcsAHaa	no<br>  i like joseph but not josey, there too close...<br>  maybe joseph and isabel|`|6xf1GfbUaa	No.. too similar in spelling and sound.|`|vXh07QLFaa	I like these names together, they sound cute. The only thing I would worry about is getting the names confused since they sound so much alike, but they are great names!|`|CTmWS6dMaa	No. I like too many names to stick with a variant of the same name. Plus it gets confusing when you are calling them for something.|`|LA5JUW5Iaa	haha. probably not.|`|7a7a8b25f6c8edb1f3143b162357b855aa	joseph its ok...<br>  i don't really like josey though...<br>  .............<br>  i think i'd name my daughter Kylee (ki-lee) Elizabeth|`|9N9LSks3aa	no in school some idiots could take the mick.|`|ZbflCIg7aa	No.|`|67wtx50gaa	no i wouldent,<br>  i like unique names such as leu leu and derren. :)|`|w1Ve4EFZaa	yes
znkumaA1aa	Babies are not supposed to sleep through the night. Check out this article and you will understand<br>  <br>  Some studies have shown that breastfed babies do wake more frequently than their artificially fed counterparts, but since breastfeeding is the norm -- what nature intended for babies -- one has to question if the expectation that a baby will sleep long stretches at night is reasonable, or even beneficial. Prior to the 19th century most human infants slept under conditions of close, continuous parental contact, with frequent nighttime breastfeedings. Even today in most non-Western cultures babies still sleep this way.<br>  <br>  One purpose of night wakings is for the baby to get nutrition. A newborn's stomach is very small -- about the size of his closed fist -- and can not hold a large volume of milk. Normal newborns will double their birth weight by about six months of age, an accomplishment that requires a very large intake of calories.<br>  <br>  We know that infants who sleep longer stretches at night seem to be at an increased risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). We don't know if that is directly related to the sleep pattern or some other compounding issue, but it does appear that sleeping through the night may involve some risk for vulnerable babies. Breastfed babies, especially those sleeping close to their mother, experience more frequent arousals during sleep. It is these arousals that are thought to decrease the risk of SIDS. Additionally it is known that 75 percent of the infant's brain development occurs after the baby is born. The human infant may need the stimulation of night wakings to assist with normal neurologic function that controls breathing. (McKenna 1993)<br>  <br>  Night suckling is also known to decrease maternal fertility. This is nature's way of helping to ensure that the mother's body has time to rest before the next pregnancy and that the infant has a period of individual nurturing. (Riordan & Auerbach 1998)<br>  <br>  Your baby will stop waking at night when the needs met by nighttime nursings are fulfilled. I hope this will help you view night wakings from a different perspective and that will make it a bit easier to accept them as a normal, and even beneficial, part of parenting your baby.|`|GJgZVKvXaa	Nobody actually sleeps all night solid.  The body goes through patterns of deep sleep followed by light sleep and brief periods of waking.  To sleep through the night, a baby has to learn to go back to sleep after these brief awakenings.  Some babies do seem to learn this on their own, but others need help to learn.  That is what sleep training is.  <br>  <br>  It's up to you to decide whether you think your daughter can sleep all night.  It's your call as her mom.  However, if you decide to do sleep training you have to commit to it for at least 2 weeks.  It will not work perfectly the first night or even the third or fourth probably.  You have to be persistent.<br>  <br>  By 6 months old a baby CAN go 8 hours without milk; so it's likely your daughter is using nursing as a prop to help her get back to sleep when she wakes up at night.  You can try to teach her to soothe herself using a pacifier, thumb sucking or by giving her a comfort object.  You can also try simply going to her, cuddling and rocking her but not nursing and see if she's able to go back to sleep without it.  Then you can gradually give up rocking, perhaps just patting and shh'ing her without actually picking her up.<br>  <br>  There are other methods to sleep training that don't involve crying.  Try looking into "no cry" or "Gentle Good Night" methods.<br>  <br>  Also, don't discount Dr. Ferber just because people call his method "cry it out."  His book contains lots of information about sleep in children that can be helpful for you to learn, even if you don't decide to use his method.|`|JuWL7T0Haa	at 6 months your baby shouldn't be waking up to nurse isn't she on solids yet?  they tell you at this point not to feed them at night just hold her and comfort her and try to get her to sleep than lay her down and sometimes you have to let them cry for at least 5-10 mintues otherwise your baby is never going to learn to self soothe.  if she goes longer than that than of course go and pick her up.  do you give her gas drops when u feed her?  that should help my daughter had to have gas drops and they helped her alot.  she is 6 months and she is sleeping around 11 hrs a night and she takes 2 naps a day.  ohh also try some soft music in her room I put on some lullabys or her ceiling fan and the noise seems to help her fall asleep|`|jsjkTEokaa	Whilst I was pregnant I read lots of sleep training books but never put any of them into use as they all advocated the use of the 'cry it out' method which just wasn't for me (although many people swear by it).<br>  <br>  My 8 month old has only just stopped waking for night feeds (he used to wake 3 times too) and I know many mums who have older babies who still feed during the night. It just seems to happen and it comes as a pleasant surprise too!<br>  <br>  What I can tell you is that you hardly remember the night waking and how tired you felt when you look back and you'll never regret crawling out of bed in the early hours for night feeds/burps/cuddles.|`|mVD3TQkFaa	My daughter is a month old and is already sleeping through the night for the most part. She has completely a couple time and other then that she goes down at 11:00pm every night and wakes up about 4:30-5am to eat and then she back down till 8-9am. I am very routine in my own life so when I brought her home it was instant for me to get her into a routine that worked for both of us and she took very well to it. I change her feed her and lay her down and play the same little music box every time she goes to bed and takes a nap so she associates the song with sleep time. Also keep it very dark and low activity starting at a certain time every night so she knows it is bed time not play time. Good luck I know mine could change any minute with my little one being so young but I'm hoping we can stick to this.|`|nFE6T6Hgaa	My son is 10 months and we have had 5 consecutive nights of sleep :) Finally! I think babies do it at different times "when they are ready" but if she's waking up to eat you may have a problem there. 6 month olds don't need to wake up to eat. I would suggest giving her cereal before bedtime (It didn't work with my son but has worked for several friends of mine and my daughter when she was a baby) Also If you bottle feed at all try giving her a bottle of water at night when she wakes up sometimes a baby will decide not to wake up if it's really not worth it. Keep the ;lights off, try not to play with her or give her much attention ( I know that's hard!) and skip the diaper change unless she's soaked. Good Luck!|`|5JB1fHz9aa	My son just eventually started sleeping through the night and than entirely through the night.  When a baby sleeps 6 hours in a row that is considered sleeping through the night.  My son actually slept the entire night at 2 months old and was breastfed, but later started waking up again at about 4 months old.  He finally stopped waking up at about 9-10 months old on his own.  If your child still wakes up over a year that's when I think you need to start "training" them to sleep through the night.  At 6 months, your baby still needs to eat round the clock especially because you are breastfeeding.|`|rjVALevtaa	Babies will sleep through the night when they're ready. There really isn't a way to "train" them to do so. <br>  <br>  My son is almost 6 months and he still wakes up during the night occasionally. Although I have noticed that if I arrange his feedings so that he eats right before bed he is more likely to sleep through the night. <br>  <br>  Have you tried giving her gas drops with her last feeding? That may be helpful.|`|DIZKlxNraa	My baby is almost 9 months and still wakes up every 2-3 hours at night. I tried to let him cry but it didn't work for me. He cried for 2 hours straight and I couldn't stand it any more. Books say that 80% of babies sleep through the night by age of 9 months. I know my baby is probably not going to sleep through the night even by 12 months. He also doesn't take naps by himself (I either take him for a walk in the stroller or hold him on my lap).<br>   I read 3 books: "The no-cry sleep solution" , "The no-cry nap solution", "Healthy sleep habits, happy child". None of them worked for me:(.|`|7rIAd6gGaa	My daughter didn't sleep through the night until she was a year old. I'm pretty sure that's because I was nursing her, and she wanted the comfort. Once I started giving her a bottle when she woke up, she stopped waking up. She didn't really want the milk. I don't know if you're nursing, but maybe you could try the bottle. It might help. Good luck!|`|jN3pRKkEaa	My first son was the same way until about 7 months.  You can try different methods such as feeding them a bottle w/ some cereal in it (to fill them up), keep them awake later, etc....for me I had to train him by letting him cry it out and giving him cereal in a bottle w/ formula.|`|Qe9rXFm0aa	OMG you sound exactly like me about 2 months ago!!<br>  I swore up and down something was wrong with my daughter. I started writing down every single time she woke up..and at 6 months she was still waking every 1-2 hours at night somethimes 30 or 40 min later. I nursed or rocked her back to sleep every single time, by myself for 6.5 months!! I cried so many nights..I cant even tell you.<br>  <br>  But one night, at 6.5 months old, she slept through the entire night 8pm to 8 am..I couldnt believe it..and now at 8 months..she just wakes once a night.<br>  <br>  So yes I totally 100% believe a baby will sleep through the night when they are developmentally ready. And NO you do not need sleep training! Just create a steady bed time routine..stick to it, and be patient..your daughter WILL sleep longer stretches.<br>  <br>  And 3 times a night isnt even too bad, at 6 months my daughter was waking 6-8 times a night.
S1gJJHNzaa	my advise would be to call back and get the exact hcg beta count.   most labs report under 5 as negative and over as positive but some it's 10 and some even 20.<br>  <br>  my fertility dr. said that all woman keep a very small amount of hcg in their system all the time, but never over 2.5.. he said that anything over 2.5 and something is trying to happen but it needs to be over 5 to really be considered a pregnancy.<br>  <br>  call and get that number!|`|aWkp6AJOaa	the only way it could be wrong is by the miscalculation of ovulation dates.  it will detect the hcg hormone if pregnant 10 days after ovulation.  seeing as you have some spotting & the test came back negative i would say that you are not pregnant.  i totally know how frustrating this is, i too had long time periods before getting pregnant.  just take one day at a time & start tracking your BBT if you don't already & go to the web md ovulation calculator so you have a better chance of getting pregnant.  good luck & best wishes to you.|`|ZbnxGIsnaa	Well, yes they can be!  My friend is now 20 weeks and she got a negative blood test at 6 weeks and then took a urine test a week later and got a positive.  So, yes it's possible you are pregnant and it's just not showing yet.  =)|`|I7sS4w0maa	You know I am in the Medical Field <br>  <br>  If your test is NEG than it is NEG a Blood test is 100% accurate..<br>  <br>  You NEED to speak with you GYNO about FIBROID CYSTS and PCOS Poly Cystic Ovarian Syndrome..

That was nearly 8 years ago. My idea of lingerie is a t-shirt and shorts, and now that I'm pregnant, the only criteria is that the t-shirt has to fit and the shorts have to be nylon running shorts so I can turn over in bed more easily.

See? I'm living through you. I want to buy it- but can't- so you do it!|`|VwMkiLFPaa	Um, no! I have some beautiful ones too! I think there’s serious dust on them though. <br>  <br>  Don’t you have to get along with your spouse in order to go there? Well, no, I could totally tell wear it and say “THIS is what you could have….”<br>  <br>  Nahhh, I’ll stick with my sweatpants!|`|hKJIDdVqaa	lol, yes I wear these lovely lingerie "t-shirts" they happen to be my husbands, they are rather sexy with their paint splatters and holes (my husband owns a construction company)|`|4gZYucHMaa	I have 3 *pretty* litte numbers but  wear them once in a blue moon for hubby. He'd rather me butt naked over wearing a pc of clothing, no matter how sexy it is looking.
zBz10IiOaa	yea it is fine just make sure the decibles are not to loud for yourself so they don't make ya deaf :) i have woofers in my car and i love to listen to my music and baby dances in my belly too :)|`|H0fXySX9aa	my hubby has an amp and sub in his car and as long as it stays at volume 25 2 kids and both with ok hearing|`|LKIhUMCgaa	actually no, it's not safe, too much vibration, it can make ur heart start racing and end up giving u high blood pressure. also, the baby can feel all of that and all the vibration and really loud sound is not safe for the baby.|`|V8JoRHnnaa	i think its safe.
l4mMBe5Aaa	Our daughter was a very early walker (took her first unassisted steps at 8 months!)...  We bought some toys like the one your mom picked out, but I found that most of them are hard to steer (so they run into furniture really easily) and go too fast for babies who are just learning to pull up on things and take a few steps (the toy wants to go while the baby leans on it).  Honestly, a plastic clothes basket worked really well on the carpet, as it doesn't go fast, and it's at a really good height.  And, it's free if you already have one, and only a couple of bucks if you don't!|`|p2Njf5gBaa	I have one of those,  but honestly, my son never tried to walk with it, it was harder then just taking steps alone.  He likes to ride on it from time to time though.  As far as walking with it, it never worked out for him.  When he was ready to take steps away from furniture, he just did it and without the help of something like that.  Usually when I would put it in front of him, he would plop down on his butt and play with the little toys on it and check it out.  <br>  <br>  As far as helping her stand, thats okay from time to time, but its also okay for her to try on her own.  Its the only way she will learn.  It may look like she is struggling to get up today, but give her a little time and practice and she will be getting up like a pro before you know it.|`|MQ1sXYBbaa	We have a toy that looks like a old person's walker with a piano keyboard and little steering wheel parts that our daughter would walk with.  We have carpet and it works well so she can't go too fast.  The only problem is if it gets stuck and tries to tip over.  She didn't go that fast so we could always catch her before she actually fell.  We had another one like the link that she tried on a hard floor and went way too fast.  She had no chance with that one on a hard floor.  Just holding her hands and walking seemed easiest though.|`|8a97cd40085f30a1d504e99ab5132ba5aa	I am not sure if my answer will be any help, but I was reading a lot about walkers, and actually pediatritians do not recommend using them nowadays. It can influence wrong development of some leg muscles, and also they tip over too often.
wiAVa1H5aa	Hum, perhaps I fall into the bullying category in some folks eyes, but I also think that the evidence is pretty clear as well, and those that decide to bottle feed for anything other then a medical reason are hurting our world.   Pretty cut and dried I think, if it hurts that's because they know they're wrong.|`|UghJ0XROaa	Hmmm, lol, talking about someone whose name is also a female body part? If you are trying to "win" someone to your side, you can't be condescending or insult everyone who doesn't do it your way!|`|pXSKSS3daa	Lol... hmm... I can only imagine who this is about!<br>  <br>  Yes, it irks me. You can be a supporter of something without being rude about it!<br>  <br>  ETA: LOL, bluenaketat, I guess we're all thinking of the same person.|`|ccd9bacbf1ad616406e98ebf61adc6dcaa	I saw that answer a few minutes ago, and I felt the same way as you!<br>  <br>  Honestly, I'm surprised she hasn't been suspended over that truly disgusting username. I've gotten violation notices over much less.|`|dAQHWvY0aa	I call myself an advocate - I'm so proud of the fact I could (and am!) still doing the "impossible" lol - sometimes I guess I get carried away with overwhelming people with all the tricks and facts that I know now... I look back and just wish I had more info, even useless info the first time around instead of not enough, so I guess now I'm living vicariously through what I would have wanted to know if I was just starting out all over again...<br>  So I guess I'ze guilty as Ash and Ethel!|`|ANHsv4ENaa	Uh oh, guilty. I really try not to be a jerk but there are times when someone just words something in a way that sets me off. Sorry. I will work on that. ;)<br>  EDIT**<br>  Aww, thanks. I'm sure many would disagree but I'm glad you don't see me that way! lol.|`|AA11210211	Did I miss something?? lol I do see what you are saying though,sometimes I try to avoid the BIG debating issues.
NWxzhPMbaa	Nipple confusion is only likely to surface in the first month or so of a baby's life.  After that time, it is not very likely. (This is the reason the American Pediatric Assoc. recommends use of a pacifier after a baby reaches 1 mo old).  <br>  <br>  I would think your daughter is having difficulty breathing through her nose, which makes a solid latch difficult.  She is trying to suck and breathe through her mouth at the same time.  She's probably readjusting the way she normally sucks in order to do both.<br>  <br>  My son has never used a bottle and he has always been extremely comforted by sucking on the boob.  He got a small cold once and that was the ONLY time he has ever refused to latch.  When he finally did latch, it was just as you described.  Within a day or so he was better and back to his old ways.  I wouldn't worry...I'm sure your daughter will be back to normal once she starts feeling a little better.  Good luck!|`|mjz8JF9Gaa	its not nipple confusion <br>  nipple confusion is a total myth <br>  she is just feeling crappy and is exhausted from her cold|`|oA8Rtyxuaa	if she is congested it might be hard for her to eat because she can't breathe through her nose. If her nose id stuffy, try baby ayr saline nose drops and a humidifier.|`|wiAVa1H5aa	It can happen very quickly, but it usually occurs with newborns not 4 month olds.   She's probably having a hard time breathing even now when nursing, when my sons had that problem we did the spray and suck - get some saline nasal spray for babies, spray her nose and then suck out the liquids with a bulb.<br>  <br>  Sorry about the illness, we've been dealing with a lot of very very bad viruses too.|`|HS6sFJPjaa	Nipple confusion from what I was told usually would only happen in the first couple of weeks when the baby is learning to feed. The weird sucking sound is probably from being congested.|`|tZt7fUYYaa	Mine did the same when she had a cold as she couldnt breathe whilst sucking. Mine had more exposure to the bottle as well and i think for a bit she did have nipple confusion as she wasn't latching on correctly and was sucking the end of my nipple instead of taking it all in. However she has since resolved the issue. I think with your daughter having a cold she might just be struggling with feeduing. mine fed more frequently and for less time when she was congested.|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	if she is congested it's probably from that- she is trying to nurse but breath as well. this happens with niple confusion and it can happen fast but i think your daughter's latch and sucking out of whack from the cold- this happened to my son whne he was congested but i KNEW it wasn't nipple confusion he just couldn't breath.
OBU1eDUHaa	My little guy would always wake up at night screaming with a temp. when he had an ear infection.  I don't remember him tugging at his ears when he had an ear infection until he was around 10 months or so.  Keep up w/ the motrin. Call the MD and take him in tomorrow, you can never be to careful.  Good luck!|`|aWEybdDFaa	If the ER "jerk" Doctor said it's an ear infection then your baby should've gotten antibiotics. If he didn't get that and just motrin than the Doctor is a bigger jerk!<br>  <br>  Babies are all different some handle pain better than other, it doesn't mean all kids tug on the ear when it hurts. <br>  <br>  Get a second opinion, your baby should be taking antibiotics if there's an infection present.|`|UXhFcHCHaa	omg do we have the same child???? my son has been very hot for the past 2 days also but he doesnt have a fever. i take his temp like every 30 min with 2 temp readers. i dont know how to spell it lol. he doesnt have a fever and he is still smiling. this morning he woke up normal not hot or anything. its probably a virus going around bc he has had a cough and boogies.|`|lnsOJ3GBaa	First off, infants are able to sustain much higher fevers than adults so while 103 would be disconcerting for an adult it's not so much something to stress about with an infant. Although it should of course be monitored. <br>  <br>  It's hard when you're baby is hurting and the doctors aren't any help. Frustrating really so I understand. It sounds to me that he's got some teething issues going on. It's possible that he could have a bug but without other symptoms, vomiting, diarrhea ect... I don't think so. <br>  <br>  Infants motrin always helped my son who cut 4 teeth at a time and started teething at 3 months old even though his first teeth didn't come in until he was about 5 or 6 months old. Motrin will help to cut the fever and alleviate some of the pain at the very least. If things do persist I would definitely take him to his pediatrician. Good Luck to you and God Bless.|`|q4rG5Dwtaa	Same exact thing happened to my little boy last Thursday, He's 7 months old, Brought him to daycare he was fine, I even called and checked on him around lunch, When I picked him up at 4:30 his fever was 103, I freaked out and called my husband because he looked horrible all he would do was moan, so we brought him straight to the ER, they did chest xrays, RSV test, Flu test every thing came back clear, so he wanted to give him antibiotics saying it was  an ear infection, I waited and brought him to his regular doctor the next morning, and sure enough he had a bulging ear drum, I felt so bad. Anyway his doctor gave him 2 shot of antibiotics one Friday and one Saturday, and gave him Zithromax for 4 days, he was also on Tylenol with codeine in it to help the pain, he is so much better now. Good Luck, I know what you are going through.|`|rdpZrBc9aa	Yes, it could be an ear infection.  Alternate Motrin and Tylenol every 3 hours.  Bathe him in lukewarm water, not cold.  There are gel patches you can get that will stick to his forehead to help with the fever.  Did the ER doctor give you any medicine for him?  <br>  <br>  You really need to check around and see if there are any after-hours clinics in your area.  They are much faster and cheaper than the ER for anything that's not a true emergency.  They'll send you to the ER if it's worse than you think.  My daughter likes the pediatric one we go to if we need to go when our doctor is closed.  They have satellite TV in every room!  Also, a pediatric clinic will have more experience with ear infections, and a better attitude!<br>  <br>  You need to write a polite letter of complaint to the hospital about that doctor.  It needs to be polite so they don't think you're some kind of nut.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	What a rude comment and very unprofessional.<br>  <br>  <br>  From my experience, they can have an ear infection that can cause fever w/ no tugging or pulling on ears.<br>  Also, my youngest just got over a virus w/ the same symptoms you described.  It didn't last long though.  <br>  <br>  I hope he feels better soon!!|`|mO2oOqZ3aa	ER doctors don't know your child, call his pediatrician!!! It could be a sign of another type of infection...i wouldn't wait.|`|58b352907ba2def5e2248c3df2e55128aa	Landon has had an ear infection for 2 weeks now and his temperature will go down during the day but will go up to 104 at night. So to me it sounds like your son has an infection somewhere. I would take him to the pediatrician tomorrow and let him get looked at.|`|nKXTjqQWaa	He's teething! Same thing with my son, had a temp, no sign of ear infection or anything else just cranky with a temp and he is teething :) No need to worry just keep his temp down with either tylenol or motrin. Motrin is suppose to help more with the pain.|`|930a625eb301aae633a9b9d8e18e0752aa	Possible a bladder infection. They go undiagnosed in little ones often. Or a UTI.|`|pXSKSS3daa	My son didn't tug on his ears when he had his first(and only) double ear infection. That's not always a sign.<br>  <br>  Is it possible it's teething? Noah had a 101-102 fever a couple weekends ago and it was chalked up to teething because we noticed a bump where one of his molars would be at, now you can see the tiniest white dot there.<br>  <br>  It's so hard with babies because they cannot tell you what's wrong so we're left to guess. I would alternate between Tylenol and Motrin, though, that is what we did Saturday afternoon-Sunday and his temp was down to 99 Sunday night and 98.6 that following Monday.
jhPlVj0oaa	Check this out, my friends little boy had something very similar to what you're describing. <br>  Good luck.|`|7X0zAd9kaa	Normally 12-18 months is when separation anxiety to 1 parent or caregiver is the worst.  This is a time period when the child has a strong preference for 1 parent or caregiver and has a lot of anxiety when that person is not with them.  He will out grow it.. just be patient with him.|`|WpBqlEW5aa	Yes, he very well could be. Normally kids go through it around 6 months of age-a year. He could just be going through it a little later. Has anything changed lately? Any new sitters, day care, etc? It could just be very well that he is having anxiety. It is normal for children. It will pass...sometimes VERY slowly :)   But it will|`|Vl7trXXraa	Yes, it can be separation anxiety. Brianna is 10 months old and she is doing the same thing.  She used to love the day care but now she hates it. she wants me to hold her all the time.
1VnWhP1Saa	it should be fine the sound has to get through layers of fat, muscle & all the fluid. Recent studies have found that music is good for unborn babies it stimulates brain growth. I went to plenty of concerts during my last pregnancy & my bump she loved it, she would kick hell out me when the band stopped & would settle when they played, now she's 6 months old & loves music & she will only settle to sleep if the stero is on lol|`|ZYlr9TSBaa	No not at all hun. I went to a music concert (Stereophonics) when I was 35 weeks pregnant (I did ask my midwife, the midwife on duty at my local hospital and my HV lol). Just try not to get too close to the speakers, and if it really bugs you, put some coats over your bump :) have fun! x|`|chTCMyQ5aa	I'm 18 weeks and I blast music in my car on the way home from work. I think the baby likes it cause I can feel her kick and move. A couple of times it was too the beat of the music :)|`|c9NuCZnaaa	no it wont affect your baby. you know when you're in the bath and you stcik our head underwater and you can barely hear anything? well it's like  that for a baby. he can't hear too much it's all very muffled. He can hear the vibrations in your voice and he will be able to hear some dull sounds with the music but it wont damage him. <br>  I love live music and i went out a few times to gigs when i was pregnant. and i now have a very happy healthy boy who loves music!!! music is said to help brain development. so really you're helping him out while enjoying yourself!<br>  have fun while you still cann!!!!|`|aGxbD6snaa	no its good for your baby, i had the same worry as you but when i realised my baby kicked everytime a certain song came on i relaxed. your baby needs to be around noise etc otherwise when theyre born theyll never sleep through any noise. just carry on as normal your baby will be enjoying it as much as you.|`|mBfvthNaaa	No, but I always listened to calm, soothing music when I was farther along in my pregnancy.  I had read that it would calm the baby.|`|WFVWKOtgaa	It should be ok<br>  ive been out a couple of times.<br>  and it hasnt effected me.<br>  but diff for every person i supposex|`|ZcFchrkhaa	No it wont affect you're baby, you are over analysing things way too much
tSEA42Uraa	Tacky, very tacky. Unless the name is another name backwards, which would rarely happen, it won't work.<br>  <br>  If the father is called "Jim" or "Jimmy", he could have named his son Jameson, which means "James' son", and called him Jamie to lessen the confusion.<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  ~Emily-Maria|`|d233c5a2e4e12b8e3298613c249d71b4aa	Tacky!|`|DHwPgw9iaa	Kinda weird... If I did that, my baby would be named Yelhsa. Ha!|`|NNki7qiFaa	Tacky|`|fboC1N7gaa	I'm not really in love with it.  What about Jameson/Jamison.  That way it's still after his father.  You could call him Jay or Jamie for short.|`|6ZHAzrA0aa	Ick<br>  <br>  ? Taylor|`|eWCMPZL2aa	whaa? SEMAJ?! whoa. no. when they get to school no one would be able to spell or say that. bad idea.|`|2yEQE2U4aa	a bit tacky plus it doesn't fit the baby<br>  and if there die hard on having Semaj as a name make it the boys middle name|`|6xf1GfbUaa	Tacky.|`|GZn5VNlSaa	Horrible name!! It does sound middle eastern!! Uggg poor kid!|`|yXGlmUqlaa	i don't like the name at all<br>  i'd say tacky<br>  they should've just had James as a middle name|`|3AfQ9UXYaa	Poor baby. They meant well but showed it in a bad way. I wonder if he will get his name changed in the future.|`|0BX1yFGuaa	Blatantly stupid.<br>  <br>  These parents need to be hit in the head with a tack hammer.|`|BiMeb75Gaa	No, it sounds weird they should of just called him James lol! If it was me my kid would be called Nlitiac (eww!)|`|uhZzEzu0aa	it is cute but yeah doesnt seem like it fits him. But hey maybe the name will grow as he does or he he doesnt like it he might use his middle name. My friend is named robert but he hates it so he uses his middle name scott. hope this is an answer that works.|`|qTUv25awaa	Tacky Tacky Tacky|`|QP62szAuaa	I don't like that name what about Jamie.
CscNjMzwaa	I think this is really stupid. How do you even pronounce that name?|`|GFzDwIk6aa	No offence to them, but Semaj is a terrible name. Why couldn't they have just called him James Jr?|`|pl7lWGZDaa	I think it's goofy. Not tacky, just dumb. Semaj...I wouldn't even know how to pronounce that! Whatever happened to James, Jr. ?

Not bad though.<br>  <br>  Heidi- I've never been fond of this name- all the Heidi's I've known were nasty, but this is one of my grandma's favorite names. She REALLY wants a great-granddaughter named Heidi. (It's not coming from me though!)<br>  <br>  Rowan- Finally somebody else that likes Rowan for a girl! I love it after reading Anne Rice's Mayfair Series. I have a friend who just named one of her twin boys Rowan though...I just don't see it for a boy.<br>  <br>  Ophelia- I actually like thos one, though it's a bit too associated with Shakespeare to use for a real baby. It's pretty. I would use for a cat, maybe.<br>  <br>  Vanessa- Beautiful name. I would guess a Vanessa to be popular and pretty, and high-maintenance. And maybe a bit snooty<br>  <br>  Boys:<br>  <br>  George- I love this name too. I think there should be MORE little boys named George these days. It's a classic, strong, manly name! C'mon people! Name your boys George!<br>  <br>  Felix- Um, The CAT? Not a name for a person IMHO. Sorry.<br>  <br>  Drake- It's kinda avant garde, I think it could grow on me.<br>  <br>  Tristan- I went to high school with a Tristan...he was not someone I would want to name my child after. I just have that negative association with this name. I know it's popular now and all, but I'm not on that bandwagon.<br>  <br>  Lucas- very cute! Lucas works well on little boys as well as grown men. This is a great name choice.|`|zbjaBgyEaa	Emmalia - I don't really love it.

It just sounds and looks really ugly to me.<br>  <br>  Rowan - Much prefere it on a boy.<br>  <br>  Ophelia - Love.  Very rare, very beautiful.  It's gorgeous.<br>  <br>  Vanessa - I like it.  It's sounds sweet and gentle.  It's not a name I hear very often.<br>  <br>  George - I like the name George.  A lot.  I think it's really strong and classic and handsome.  It's nice.<br>  <br>  Felix - I'm torn. I think it sounds a bit dated.  But at the same time. It's sort of cute too.<br>  <br>  Drake - Dislike.  It sounds chavvy to me - a little cheesy.  LIke the hero in some lurid romance novel or something.<br>  <br>  Tristan - Also, really chavvy in my opinion.<br>  <br>  Lucas - It's nice.  A little common and maybe a tad dull.

ptwnCWloaa	Orange juice or ice water.  I had a 4D ultrasound and they told me to drink a bottle of orange juice about 20 minutes before.  They said the natural sugars sometimes help to get the baby more active.  Although, I did this and she wasn't moving much at all.  So I drank a glass of ice water and walked around a bit and that did the trick.|`|IFDfpbFJaa	My doctor told me to come with a full bladder and to not drink anything with carbonation in it because the bubbles will get in the way of the ultra sound.  Good Luck :)|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	A good idea might be to bring some orange juice with you to the ultrasound. My baby just was pretty still the whole time and was in a good position so it was great she wasn't moving around a lot. But, if yours is not in a good position once they look, if you have a bit of juice that will most likely get him/her moving around pretty quickly. Good luck!|`|T48smu01aa	well if you just want your baby to move a lot when your in there just drink a soda or something really really cold :0 about 15-20 min b4 you go in.<br>  Good luck and congrats!!!|`|wKuQC4yTaa	orange juice. the sugars are suppose to wake the baby up and make them more active, and easier to see.|`|GCPbKg9Eaa	It shouldnt make a difference at all.<br>  But I believe sugars make them move around more.|`|lC7oWudPaa	just drink lots of water|`|9cpwsrJiaa	Everyone told me to drink a little caffeine (like a can of pop) before the ultrasound so if she wasn't in a good postion, she would be moving around a lot. She did move a lot, but she still kept her little legs crossed, but we finally got her to spread em!|`|FsFUo4VJaa	Just water.
dcDY9pJeaa	I think that's the right thing to do.  A photo, a backstory - saying that the father loved your son/daughter and wanted to be there and then an accident or whatever,  that would be the right thing to do,<br>  <br>  at some point you need to share you don't know - i think for medical reasons - like you don't want him/her lieing to the doctor about medical conditions - patient history  - know what i mean|`|a0e64779677c884ea4ca4c17390ea954aa	Start doing the math..You can easily figure back to within a two week period of when he was conceived. Now unless you slept with a different person each day of that time frame (if you did I salute you,14 people ?that's my best year) ,you know who they are. So start making calls. Your son has a right to know,as does the father. All that you need is a name to start with.|`|n8UBfhgpaa	Just get the paternity test, find the guys. Thats not fair that he doesnt have a dad because you were sleeping around. Give the kid a chance.|`|AA11429880	Tell him the truth.  Tell him you (were? are?) a ho and have no idea who his father is.  Tell him you didn't keep track of such trivial details.|`|3kRnw3eNaa	Wtf? Lien to your kid about his OWN dad? You're a worthless mother. You should care. your children need to know who their father is! i mean wtf? How old were you when you had these kids; 13?|`|SuKS1OQtaa	Wow... you have to tell him sometime... just tell him you don't know and when he gets older you can tell him why you don't know...|`|AVzQs5Uhaa	i understand that its a  hard situation but tell him the truth, you will not regret it later and don't have to live with knowing that you lied to your child. While I cant say that I agree with your lifestyle then,it happened and there is nothing that you can do to change what happened in your past. Just be honest and tell him that you were seeing a number of people at that time and that you are not sure who it is, but that doesn't matter because hes got you and you love him more then anything. Trying seeing if you can talk to other people who have been  in this situation and get their opinion. Just do yourself and your son a favor and don't lie to him,because if he finds out t he truth later on in life  he might have a hard time trusting you.|`|whoHoGjuaa	you can't just simply do this to that poor baby it's so careless and so mean !! what are you woman ? !! how could you do this to a poor baby who want's to know his father just like any other innocent kid !! . this is all because of your stupid LUST before !! .. there is no option left ,! <br>  try to find those guys ! and have a test ! OR tell him the HARD truth ! he is a human an innocent one who got involved between two stupid, punk ***, SUCK parents and who has the right to know who he is ? and whose his dad !? try to put your self in his position ! and your SLUTII mama is lying to you ! you are his mom you don't have to lie to him ! if you're lying to him and you are HIS MOM that he should trust ,how would he be treated by the others !!?  this kid is insecure ! you need to do your best to make him feel some security when you are around him!  thank god i don't have a bad mom like you ! and get the paternity test and let them find the dad ..|`|kBVCZK0Haa	what are you gonna do if one of those guys finds out you had a baby and comes and finds him and wants to be in his life. you have to be honest with your kids if you want them to be honest with you. you have to set an example he might be mad or hurt now but he will understand how hard that was for you to admit later.|`|Hx0a0Q8Uaa	You should tell your son the truth, he'll find out one way or another. After all of you show him a picture of an ex and then you run into him one night at the grocery store it's going to be rather awkward when your son runs up and grabs him 'round the waste screaming "daddy! you're alive!" then you'd really have a lot of explain!|`|tTCOo47iaa	Not to be mean or nothan but you are a slut and i am only 16 yrs old and like you need to tell your son the truth becuase you dont want to be a ****** up mom!|`|wZyRPutYaa	wow you really put yourself out there, ummm i think you should just let him know that, you don't have no idea and just keep it like that|`|vzIEn14zaa	Go for immaculate conception.  He's the next Jesus.|`|hz7Ek1HKaa	Jackpot came here 2 minutes before me and literally stole my war hero idea..<br>  <br>  ok make him an astronaut who died in space!!|`|r4cThgwdaa	Tell him he is the son of god and his birth was an immaculate conception|`|3pMQE32Vaa	wow all those guys! were they all a one night stand!?! well u need to tell him the truth! its gonna hurt more if u tell him l8tr.|`|f94429414cd98123c4786b002c4a1354aa	im gonna be mean and honest what a tramp you are tell him the truth or when he finds out the truth and believe me he will he will be very mad at you  wow what wonderful choices we make|`|VFifg9FEaa	Nope, he will find out the truth sooner or later and hate you for lieing to him all those years.  He is probably too young to understand that you slept around and don't know who the father is so telling him the whole truth right now is too much.  Maybe saying that you don't know where he lives (truth) and since he can't be part of your life right now  (truth)it is best that he doesn't know his name.(because you don't know it)  When he is older and will understand why you don't know who the father is you can tell him the whole truth.  Hopefully, for your sake you won't have brought him up will too high of morals and he won't hate you for sleeping around and not ever being able to know his father or his paternal relatives.|`|abnqs0jQaa	Don't lie to your kid. It's only going to end up making things worse later on when he is older and has more specific questions. Like what did dad die from? Where is he buried, etc... You would be walking into a whole host of other problems if you lie to him now about it.<br>  <br>  Just tell him you don't know off hand, and if he keeps asking, just say mom made some interesting choices in the past, and you really aren't sure of who the father is. You don't have to go into details, but don't try to avoid it completely...|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	no tell him you dont know ...and teach him some values if YOU find any|`|eu6UQElYaa	nope it doesn't.  Just tell the kid you don't know who his father is.|`|MVgm17o3aa	12 or 13 guys? Are you serious? That is beyond trampy!! You should not lie to your child, he will find out the truth eventually and hate you for it...Just tell him the TRUTH|`|XwQxKwRcaa	Make the guy a war hero in Vietnam. <br>  <br>  Obviously, the time lines won't fit. But the way most kids study history, he won't even notice!<br>  <br>  <br>  God Bless you!|`|JUviY9hoaa	I'm sorry. It was me. How much do I owe you for child support? Do I get visitation?|`|rPbyDmjYaa	Well first of all, you need to tell him the truth.  He may not understand now, but eventually he will. Don't lie to him.  Explain during that time of your life you made mistakes and did things you aren't proud of, but that you got the best thing out of it, him.  People need to stop judging you on here.  We all make mistakes, do stupid things.  I am sure that your not like that anymore,and if you are, who cares.  It's your life, you do what you want.  I think its crazy, that people are going to judge you and they don't even know you.
98WKYtfwaa	This was one of my stressing worries last week lol. <br>  <br>  I've bought a mixture of Huggies and Pampers, whatever is on offer. I've been told that Pampers are the best and Huggies are crap and vice versa, i was also told by a few that they're both the same. So i've decided i'll just buy both and see how i get on, because it really goes with the size and shape of your baby i think. <br>  <br>  This is what i've currently got;<br>  <br>  Newborn size 1 - 82<br>  Size 2 - 204<br>  Size 3 - 102<br>  Size 4 - 35 <br>  <br>  I was told not to buy too many newborn size 1 because your baby can be either too big for them, or grow out them fast, but if they're something like 6lbs then you can always go out and buy more size 1 instead of stocking up on millions of them and your baby turning out to be a 9 pounder then having to waste the rest of them.<br>  <br>  I've stopped buying size 1 and 2 now because i think that's enough, i went kind of overboard with the size 2's but i'm sure i'll make use of those ones. <br>  <br>  You can never go wrong with size 3 though because your baby will be in that size for a long time same with size 4. <br>  <br>  I have absolutely no idea how many they get through each day but i'm thinking it would be around 10, but that's just a complete guess lol.|`|VKgD1K3baa	I personally prefer Pampers, but I have many friends that prefer Huggies - It really depends on how they fit the baby; it's really a trial and error process, you have to find what works best for you. I only bought 1 jumbo pack of newborn diapers, ended up buying 1 more and then he was in size 1s. It is hard to tell with the newborn size because they are all born different weights - my friend's baby went directly in to size 1 diapers! My baby was born 7lbs 11oz and hers was 9 lbs. Best of luck to you!|`|QCVzUC1baa	128 is enough to keep you going!<br>  We bought about that many then bought more as and when we needed them. We aso get them from Asda - BARGAIN!!<br>  We use Pampers I think they are much better for little boys. But you should make your own mind up for which ones suit your lil girl.|`|iAQKD2YBaa	Congratulations !!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  I have never used pampers, but my 10 month old has only ever used Huggies and has not had an issue at all.  <br>  <br>  A newborn will need a nappy change every 3 hours so if you calculate that, it is about 8 nappies per day (some days you will use more than this as the minute you change them, they poo or wee in the new nappy hehehe) - Happened more than once to me when my son was a newborn.<br>  <br>  I found this information on the net:<br>   All babies are different - some are tall and slim, others are shorter and fuller, whatever your baby, please take a look at the below table to see what suits your baby best, but please remember these are guidelines for your reusable nappies only.<br>  <br>  <br>  Newborn    T <br>  2.5 - 6kg  5 - 13 lbs <br>  MY SON WAS 7 KILOS AT 4 MONTHS OLD SO I WOULD HAVE STOPPED USING NEWBORNS JUST BEFORE THIS TIME. He was a big baby though. <br>         <br>  Infant<br>  5 -9kg     11- 19 lbs<br>  <br>  Crawler  <br>  8-14kg    17-30lbs<br>  <br>  Toddler <br>  13-18+kg  28 - 40 lbs  <br>  <br>  Potty Training<br>  From 9kg+<br>    <br>      <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  The Nappy Cover should be a snug fit but not tight.<br>  Just because your baby may reach a certain weight you do not have to up-size immediately, instead if little one begins to leak use this as an indication to move up a size.<br>  <br>  Please do not try and up-size your baby too quickly - this will lead to a bulky nappy for your baby and the wrap will not be a snug fit - leading to potential leaks.|`|c9NuCZnaaa	i prefer using pampers. they're a lot more absorbant and my son is generally more comfortable in them. it's easier for him to move around in them. <br>  at newborn i changed my sons nappy about 8 times a day and had only bought 2 big packs from asda beforehand as i didnt know whether they would be good or not. I tried some huggies after i used all them up but didnt like them much so switched back.|`|uprGdkTsaa	I didn't buy many nappies in advance - mostly because my baby turned up a month earlier than expected!<br>  <br>  For a 6lb premature baby I preferred Pampers, however as he grows I have bought whatever fits him best at the time. (Sometimes this has been Asda own brand but now he is 6 months old and Huggies suit him best).<br>  <br>  Although newborns can go through around 8-10 nappies a day they grow REALLY fast so they can be into the next size before you know it.|`|JuWL7T0Haa	Pampers are good but I think huggies are the best.  They aren't in the newborn size very long maybe the first month.  I would say you will go through 4-6 diapers a day.|`|z0XRuVwSaa	i prefer pampers because it soaks up all the wee over night without leaving baby clothes damp like huggies do . i also prefer using huggies baby wipes as its not so harsh on the skin to the baby . i found this out when i had my daughter 4 years ago she was in nappies until 2 and a bit . now am pregnant with baby number 2 due june 25th i have not even started getting things in yet am real superstitious but paying for the cot tomorrow and almost paid for the pram silver cross 3d <br>  good luck on nappies and your pregnancy|`|MR9iBgafaa	My baby needed:<br>  <br>  Size 1 - 150 - about 2 months worth<br>  Size 2 - 150 - about 2 months worth<br>  Size 3 - so far 200 and she's not even near to outgrowing them. She's been in them for 1 and a half months already. <br>  Size 4 - we've bought 200<br>  Size 5 - not bought any yet.<br>  <br>  <br>  She goes through about 6 in 24 hours.
wKuQC4yTaa	10 weeks|`|cs1QVwalaa	you look like your 3-4 maybe five months considering your small frame..im alittle thicker and im 16 weeks..ilook just as small as yu..<br>  <br>  it should grow tho..|`|lwaSJn3Gaa	i would say 10-15 weeks which is 2-3 months|`|A0tWlG94aa	omg you look like you're in your first trimester.....you havent put on much weight<br>  <br>  <br>  how many months are you<br>  ??|`|AA11661793	i'm going to guess about 11 or 12 weeks.|`|dR2bqUixaa	I would say 15-17 weeks. I'm the same size and I'm 17 weeks.|`|vXh07QLFaa	You are so tiny! Maybe like 12-14 weeks? Good luck :)|`|ECPdAeHQaa	14-17 weeks|`|mbGOEZSAaa	4-5 months maybe|`|d5fd9d057a20f9f41b37d39a5288a98faa	I think 13 weeks or so....|`|4XfjUcvDaa	prob 4 months if that|`|ZSSUfSXwaa	4 maybe..|`|yOyg3gnJaa	It really depends on what pregnancy this is for you.  If it is pregnancy #1, probably around 4-5 months- that's about the size I was when I was around 18 weeks.  If this is your second or beyond, probably closer to 3 months.|`|S4DNQkFraa	You look so cute. I have the same bump, only slightly bigger. Congrats, chika!! Talk with you soon!!|`|TljXiSNnaa	yea that looks about right 10 weeks....im 16 weeks and lost 12 pounds...nobody can tell and it upsets me lol!!!! but the compliments are nice|`|AA11380378	16 weeks<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|zSABr7praa	14 weeks?

I started showing when I was 6 months(24 weeks pregnant).<br>  Good Luck|`|kv8ZFPP1aa	uhm i would think about 12 weeks if that??|`|xpstigPTaa	not far along at all. Maybe 3-4 months if that.

62hGVNhoaa	Try some neat alcohol, it should dry it up a bit.|`|AA11612508	go to drug store and get abreva...(sp?) my family members have  cold sores and this helps and takes away fast. like week or so. but fastest out there.<br>  dont try weird food receipies the more you mess with it the more inflammed and messd up you will look.|`|NGBP65luaa	ZOVIRAX CREAM|`|J2gS49Agaa	use anything that like will dry it out.|`|hKJIDdVqaa	try hydrocortizone cream.<br>  ? It may work.
ROJans2Taa	it's a personal choice of course, but I was in a similar boat myself, I finally got where I wanted with my job, the hours I wanted and the days, my daughter was in school, she was 6, however I wanted a baby as well, we've been saving to buy a house, which I knew would postpone that, in the end I decided no time would seem perfect for another. so we just tried and got pregnant, now im on mat leave and it will suck going back to work, ill probably have to go back to evenings but if I had waited till things seemed perfect I probably never would have had him. I don't know whats right for you, but for me, I was glad I decided to go for it. best luck|`|tMl7GjqTaa	curios what would you do if it was a boy?<br>  you might wanna adopt a girl|`|IWzYB44raa	There is no perfect time to have a child.  Some people wait and wait and then never have them.  Maybe you should pray about it.|`|FsmcCXlvaa	The sooner you have another child the sooner you can start your career. It sounds like you're a sahm, right? Since you're planning the start of your career with the start of your son in school? I say start trying for another baby now. It'll delay the beginning of your teaching career but it sounds like the best option for you. I may be a little bias because I just did something similar. <br>  <br>  My son is 5 and will be in school next year. My daughter will be 1 next month. Just thinking about how much longer I will be working from home doing daycare (until Sydney starts school in 4 years) seems like an eternity. My hubby and I wanted three kids so we bit the bullet and got pregnant a few months ago. Sydney and her baby brother/sister will be 18 months apart which is much more do-able as far as getting me back in the work force sooner. <br>  <br>  Besides, if you get pregnant now your kids will only be two years apart which is a great age difference. I know that gives you a little longer before you'll be able to start teaching but you may want to put the little one in preschool at 3 or 4 years old and it'll all work out. I say go for it now!|`|MgvYMfIWaa	my kids are 3 yrs apart. my son is only 2 month old but i will be putting him in daycare. i havent worked since before i got pregnant with my daughter 3yrs ago and im ready to be out of the house. i would just work on your school and get that done and if you have another child that isnt old enough to go to school then put them in day care. you need to have a life of your own outside of your kids. i love my children with all my heart but im ready to have a life of my own outside of the house again.
uFrqC4Y2aa	I had complete previa too. And it's now moved up next to the baby. I didn't do anything extra. I just took the doctor's advice and took it easy.|`|Bw1h5xAcaa	You can't force your baby to grow, and growth does not = physical maturity. Your baby would still be premature at 32 weeks even if it was large in size, and it would still have the physical lung maturity of any other 32 weeker. <br>  <br>  The good news is that at 32 weeks your baby will be fine with a little extra time in the hospital. Survival rates surpass 95% by 28 weeks, so by 32 weeks there is almost no chance that your baby wouldn't survive. Talk to your doctor about your concerns.|`|S4soZUFCaa	Taking extra vitamins for anyone is not really a good idea. They can be harmful if too high. Just eat healthy and maybe take a muti-vitamin every other day.|`|OSiSIly3aa	I'm not sure. Buy a book about nutrition for pregnancy. <br>  I once read that pregnant shouldn't take vitamin A, or should cut down on it.|`|qeLikL8Haa	vitamin c,a and e
T48smu01aa	Yep and then 40 weeks 10 months so your basically pregnant 10 months....most woman will give birth 38-40 weeks of pregnancy :) Crazy huh!|`|8WRnqs08aa	Technically, there are 4.33 weeks in each month!|`|GdSzrtmAaa	Yes|`|DNygQdmVaa	yes that is right.|`|oA8Rtyxuaa	yep :)|`|aWkp6AJOaa	yes, it is by the lunar months not calendar months.|`|s2F6pK9Xaa	Yes...but they still consider a normal full term pregnancy 40 weeks. this is b/c the counting begins on the first day of your cycle...the day your period begins. You would not conceive until after the period is over and a new egg is released from the ovaries. This would happen somewhere in the middle of the cycle.|`|mLbydsVIaa	yeahh...<br>  but the doctors always calculate your due date 40 weeks since the first day of your last period...not 36. why? b/c not everyone has their baby exactly at 9 months. anywhere between 9-10 months is normal..before that is considered premature..after is considered late.|`|wTYh7DiSaa	Basically, yes.|`|rAD0mL7Saa	at first then the leftover days start to add up to weeks. ie 7x4=28. most months have more days than that so you have to count them. that's why they literally get a calender and count or use a wheel. if you're talking about pregnancy.
qHa4w8eyaa	The foods that you should avoid during your 2WW are the same as those avoided during pregnancy - just in case.  Here's what I've found so far:<br>  <br>  *caffeinated beverages<br>  *unpasteurized milk and dairy products <br>  *imported soft cheeses<br>  *certain types of fish (i.e. shark, swordfish, king mackerel, tilefish and, to some extent, tuna because they contain mercury)<br>  *smoked seafood due to Listeria risks (may be labelled as lox, nova style, kippered, or jerky)<br>  *fish from lakes and rivers that may be contaminated (bluefish, striped bass, salmon, pike, trout, walleye)<br>  *raw shellfish<br>  *raw eggs<br>  *alcohol <br>  *pate<br>  *unwashed vegetables<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!  I certainly learned a lot just researching the answer to your question, so thank you! :)|`|9a3sNrEqaa	hey hun. I would try to avoid caffeine. Also make SUREEEE your taking a prenatal vitamin b/c folic acid is detrimental to the development of the baby! ( i swear it saved mine!)  I would just concentrate on getting your folic acid!!!! GOOD LUCK HUN! TONS OF BABY DUST!!!|`|ESAM0U7xaa	your suppose to avoid package meat (like sandwich meat), uncooked food (steaks), sushi while pregnant, so i think it might be a good idea to just go ahead and avoid while ttc. u can get a head start because you don't know your pregnant right away and you can just eat healthy all along :o)<br>  good luck!
AA10280194	CONGRATULATIONS MOMMY!!!  If you want a really quick positive reading on your digital then wait until about 5 days after your missed period.  Take confidence and joy from your test strips because the are proof positive for you but the digital one is exciting too.  That's what I used.  We waited until 7 days past and it turned positive in about 20 seconds!  Just remember, those sticks are designed to detect the hCG levels so if there was no hCG then they wouldn't be detecting anything at all.  CONGRATULATIONS!!!!!|`|ZbnxGIsnaa	It will definitely show pregnant!  I'm sure of it!  Mine was lighter then that and mine came back positive on the digital test.  Awww, you are definitely pregnant!!!!  Congratulations dear!!!|`|mY19PPlIaa	It should show positive. But you can rest assured you are pregnant.|`|6igjX2cnaa	The digital should give you a positive hun :)  If those internet cheap ones can pick it up than the digital should too :)  I used a cheapy with a first response and it didn't show but first response did.  By the time it showed on the internet cheapy a digital worked.  Congrats to you momma-to-be!!|`|xpstigPTaa	CONGRATS MOMMY!!!!!!!!!!!!! It should definitely show up on a digital test!!!

I am kind of disapponted but i got a positive at 9 DPO and another at 11DPO! <br>  But im now 12 DPO and all the tests i took came up negative! I have no idea what is going on! But it looks like we are both preggo and just need to give it a few more days until we have enough hormone!|`|d5fd9d057a20f9f41b37d39a5288a98faa	You are so pregnant and I am sure tomorrow when you take the digital test it will say " PREGNANT"!!!! I know its hard to believe at first, I think I took like 8/9 hpts before I really believed it, then I got to see the baby on the u/s, then there is no denying it!!<br>  <br>  GL and congrats mommy-to-be!!!!!|`|9a3sNrEqaa	hey hun!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The line should show right away as well.<br>  <br>   You didn't dip all those tests in after you dipped your ovulation test right? I did that with my tests when I was trying to conceive and the ovulation test strip caused my pregnancy test to turn positive. Im totally not trying to disappoint you. This is very exciting, but go get a first response test. You will love to see the line show up on it. Oh and dont forget to post pics!!!!|`|oB8bbiwWaa	congratulations!<br>  <br>  SO EXCITING!  yay!
AlNcvluhaa	Prenatal testing is very important...and yes it can be very hard because you might have no clue what the diagnose is gonne be on your child. But think about it if you have it done at least you'll know whats going on, and if something that can be cured and be handled then there sholdn't be any worries.... but getting a bad news can be very deppresing buy if you really think about it its better to know ahead of time than when its to late and you can't do nothing about it... There is always treatment and knowing is always best. Getting it will help with your pregnancy and can make your proccess feel better!!!! Hopefully you can take a decision on getting it one cause there very good for you and your babies health!!! and Congrats on the baby!|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	we had the screen for down syndrome, edwards and all that and the blood test came back with me having an elevated chance of having a baby with down syndrome as my numbers were higher than my age related risk... we freaked a little UNTIL we met with a genetic counselor who broke down all the numbers for us... turns out it would be a .5 percent chance (that's right a 5th of a chance) that I'd have a baby with down syndrome.. talk about your worrying! When we finally heard the tiny fraction of a number we were much happier. I say if you think it's going to weigh on you then by all means do not do it.|`|T48smu01aa	I didn't do it just b/c of that....I knew no matter what I would love and care for my child and deal with it when the time came :).....if anything were to happen.  I don't think its necessary and they say the test are not accurate. If your talking about getting an amniocentesis done that can cause miscarriage in early pregnancy... so I never took that chance...But this is something you need to decided it hard but you are the mother of the child so you do what you think is best!:)<br>  good luck and congrats!!!|`|F8iyUqJBaa	I suggest rather than having the "anything that can go wrong will" attitude, you just enjoy your pregnancy.  I highly recommend calling a  midwife instead of going to a doctor.  She will give you the safest and best possible birth experience.  She will calm all of your fears and become almost like a best friend as well.  After one visit you'll understand.  I don't think all of that testing is necessary and your mind will be put at ease|`|BxrU8kUJaa	It depends on so many factors it will be tough for people to give you answers.  Your age, family histories, exactly what testing they're offering you and how invasive it's going to get are all factors.<br>  <br>  I have had different testing done with all 4 of my pregnancies because of each individual scenario with regard to age and prior experience.  Some people are truly happier operating on an 'ignorance is bliss' sort of plane, I can't, but it works for some.|`|3X0t8JrXaa	I personally opted to take the tests.  Most of which were just blood tests/ultrasounds.  I did not get the amnio because I wasn't at risk and didn't feel the risk was worth it.  Now the reason I chose to even though most things they could find they can't correct is because IF they find that there may be a health issue there are classes they offer and places that can help you cope and prepare.  It was hard waiting a couple of days for the results so I'm sure that finding something is wrong and dealing with the remainder of the pregnancy is far worse.  It honestly is a personal choice and there is no right or wrong decision.  If you don't want to have the tests done then don't.  To be honest those tests can't tell you everything and you can still have unexpected complications or be told something is wrong only to find out it was an error.  Do what feels right for you.  Good luck to you.|`|Coc593Ikaa	I have had a CVS done.<br>  <br>  I say yes to screenings because I wanted to know what was going on and what I'm dealing with. Yes, you can have some time of agony, but there is no reason to experience what your mother did. If you have a screening (such as nuchal translucency) performed and the results come back poor, you can have a CVS or an amnio. The results of these exams are 99% accurate. My perinatologist is not young and has never seen a false positive outcome. Every pregnancy that was carried to term resulted in a baby with the diagnosed condition. A lot has changed since your mother was having children. An amnio will detect spina bifida, a CVS will not. Both will detect chromosomal abnormalities.<br>  <br>  For me, I needed the peace of mind. Yes, the few weeks (not months) waiting for the test and the results were awful, but I know now that my son is healthy chromosomally. With the CVS, I was able to be tested earlier (at 13 weeks) than an amnio, and that made a big difference. It would have been hard to wait another 3 weeks for an amnio at 16 weeks.<br>  <br>  Pros: You can buy the extra and special things that you will need to deal with a special needs baby. You can come to terms with reality before you meet your baby, so you will be more prepared to handle their condition. You can choose to terminate the pregnancy if you wish.<br>  <br>  Cons: The time between the screening and the testing does suck. And some women don't get the tests done because of the risks of miscarriage involved. For these women, they do have to wait until birth to have their answer.|`|wKuQC4yTaa	I opted to not get one because i didn't want to have the worry just like you, because the test is not always right. I love my baby girl and she's not even born yet.|`|AA11783671	Be happy and see what happens.  If you are planning to have the baby regardless of the results, why worry yourself?|`|MzjbUX5eaa	Ok let me just tell you....I'm going through this now. When you say "prenatal testing" that's vague. Some prenatal testing is necessary. Some prenatal testing is optional and some is recommended (depending on age) but still "optional". <br>  <br>  I am on my fourth and last pregnancy =). This is the first pregnancy I've had that I'm considered "high risk" because I'm over 35 (barely...am 36). I chose to get what's called a quad screen or triple screen. It's a blood test where they test for spina bifida, down syndrome, trisomy 18 and trisomy 13. My baby tested positive for down syndrome. It is only a screen though. It flags you if your baby is at a higher risk of having these chomosonal defects. I personally will be keeping my baby no matter what BUT I want to know. I need to prepare myself for things if possible. My doctor sent me for a level 3 ultrasound and she measures perfectly normal but it still doesn't mean she doesn't have down syndrome. The only test to determine 100% if she does or doesn't have any of those defects (plus a lot more) is an amnio. I chose not to get an amnio. It is what it is and if she has it then she has it. She's still perfect. <br>  <br>  Now the advice.... If you want to know without a doubt then skip it all and get an amnio. Do not bother with the stress of screenings. It's very stressful! If I had it to do over again I wouldn't have. I now have 18 weeks left to stress.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|aGYvN9pfaa	Let me just state upfront that I am completely biased. I have known several people who had TERRIBLE experiences with amnio's and so I myself will never have one. I know women who had an amnio that triggered a miscarriage. I know another where the amnio triggered early labor and the baby was born with breathing conditions as a result. And I know yet another woman who had an amnio where the entry point ended up getting infected and as you know, taking any meds while preg is always dangerous. And finally, my aunt had an amnio tell her my cousin was going to be a downs baby only to find when she delivered the child that she had a perfectly healthy baby girl. My personal opinion is that the risks of amnions outweigh the benefits and don't provide any usedul info especially if you know you're already going to keep the baby. <br>  <br>  As far as other kinds of testing I don't know as much about those. I've been reading "The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth" by Henci Goer during my pregnancy and I really like it. It's an easy read and talks objectively about the pros and cons of a lot of the medical technology out there. I think, based on your question, it'd be right up your alley (and a lot less biased than me).
OgzHcNMsaa	Lifting and turning head she was doing at about 2 weeks. She's 7  weeks now and she's been pushing up on her feet since about 5 weeks or so.|`|ZYlr9TSBaa	My daughter started lifting and turning her head when she was about 3 weeks old, and now at 6 weeks she can hold it and look around for longer. She also can lift it up higher as well.|`|Ij2rM3H4aa	My daughter started to tentatively lift and turn her head at about 3-4 weeks- she didn't master it until probably 2-3 months.  Actually, she's been bearing weight on her legs since she was about 2 weeks old- often the only way that we could get her to stop crying in the early days was to "stand" her on our lap.|`|VhH9RJrSaa	he started lifting and moving his head (unsteadily) at 4 weeks. he's now 11week and can hold his head up steadily for as long as he wants. last week he started wanting to stand but he's been "pushing" since he was 8 weeks
Tm3ItIuvaa	Yes, sodium is bad for babies, and everybody else. Babies need more iron and calcium so they can grow up.|`|Z8Ui1ugLaa	Keep everything in moderation, ask him not to cook yours with the extra salt.  Drink lots of water to help flush it from your system.  It's more harmful for you and the water retention it can cause.  That doesn't seem like too much, but read labels, lots of sodium is hidden in many easy to prepare foods, frozen food, soups, and vegetable drinks.  Good Luck|`|wKuQC4yTaa	if you have a lot of salt on a continuous basis, it can cause you to have higher blood pressure, which can alternatively have effects. but not if it is in moderation.<br>  <a href="http://www.aolhealth.com/pregnancy-guide/healthy-eating-while-you-are-pregnant" rel="nofollow">http://www.aolhealth.com/pregnancy-guide...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.marchofdimes.com/professionals/14332_1222.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.marchofdimes.com/professional...</a>|`|FsFUo4VJaa	No but it can make it so you will swell up.

IFDfpbFJaa	Google "Free baby diapers" or "Free baby items" and you might get samples but anything more than that I doubt....no one gives anything away for free anymore. Too many people would abuse it. Your best bet would be craigslist where you can get things significantly cheaper...but not free.|`|8sg43Yh3aa	There is a website called bounty, just put it in google.
O97ZoHGXaa	you may have roled and hit your arm on the wall.. i doubt it would be anything serious though.<br>  mums need to be more aware that their babies are totaly safe in thei tummies.. their surrounded in amniotic fluid and it isn't actually as easy to harm them as it makes out in the films... you know, where the woman falls to the floor clutching her stomach...  not so common at all!!|`|PA7LOoQ9aa	most likely you slept on it funny and it went to sleep or the baby is laying on a nerve and it cut the blood flow.|`|eDmdkUO3aa	You were probably sleeping on it funny. And I have been dreaming before and thought reality was a dream for like 5 seconds until I wake up ,lol.|`|ROJans2Taa	I had that with my leg and hips, pregnancy hormones do weird things, they can make you more susceptible to injury and strains, or you could have just slept on it the wrong way and pinched a nerve, I had so many weird pains during my last pregnancy, all of which my doc said was normal, best luck|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	You probably just slept on it in an awkward position. Also, during pregnancy, women tend to have more carpal tunnel problems than normal. The space that those nerves run through is very tight anyhow and the swelling/joint relaxation associated with pregnancy can cause pain there. If it went away after you moved around a bit, I wouldn't be concerned.

prqrQcd1aa	I think that they should have gotten help for their unresolved anger towards their parents before they even had kids..but since they didn't they should go and get help for it NOW and break the cycle!|`|HQKuzxulaa	In my opinion, parents who feel anger towards their own parents will compensate by being overly sweet  and protective to their children, almost wanting to shelter them from the ugliness that was. Bur this would be a mentally sound parent. You didn't say anything about parents whose mental attitude was affected by their unresolved anger.|`|KA4jmUoMaa	It's not fair to the children. What do they have to do with something that happened years before they were born? It's not their fault.|`|s4LWmcTjaa	It's not healthy and I think it shouldn't be done, but no one is perfect.  Parents will take out their anger on their kids at some point in time.  We are human.  <br>  <br>  However if there are ongoing issues of anger then I suggest the parents resolve them or at the very least get counseling.  It is not fair for the kids to have to get the brunt of the anger for things that didn't involve them, so counseling is a good solution.<br>  <br>  I think these parents are just like anyone else.  They have anger and it's unresolved and they are seeking an outlet.  Taking it out on their kids is not a healthy one, but when you are a perfect parent then you can cast the first stone.|`|4gZYucHMaa	certainly not healthy, it's hardly the childs fault<br>  <br>  I've taken my unresolved anger to my parents and absolved any dealings with them. <br>  <br>  Now I live a happy, stress free life with my 2 children and husband<br>  <br>  I don't see the point of displaced anger, I put it right where it belongs!

Sounds a little constipated, too.If you concerned,place a call to his pediatrician.<br>  ***David H-you are pretty disgusting......|`|hVVALFAPaa	Depends on what he is eating. Different foods and drinks cause different colored poop in children. He may eat one food (which makes the light green poop) at one meal, then snack on something else (which makes the dk green poop.) The two get marbled together in his system.<br>  <br>  If he seems fine, and is still eating normally, he is probably fine.|`|A2G9foewaa	the only way for me to tell is to taste it, is should have a nutty oat flavor with a hint of nougat.|`|IB2V5t1Oaa	Marbled could mean that he/she is constipated.

Either way it sounds like your little one may be getting constipated.|`|NSHZUQyOaa	having poo that resembles marbles can often indicate the child is slightly dehydrated make sure they have drinks of water during the day for 2 or 3 days and then see if you notice a change.|`|iFDye9RMaa	I would say its the just the food your babe has been eating. I noticed that when I feel my daughter sweet potatoes her poop is almost blue.. kinda odd and very freaky the first time she had them.|`|6IH8BhUSaa	sounds a little constipated to me|`|20542bc530ff16912f465f7abd18306eaa	Its normal...may just be what the child is eating dont worry much abt it.|`|zJ483z2kaa	Of course.
fUC4wCCEaa	My son still does the same thing if you give him the stage 3 foods.  He will spit out any of the chunks and will not swallow them.  He has been doing that since I first tried giving them to him at 8 months and he still does it at 11 months!  So I just don't give them to him any more.  He even does the spitting food out thing to other foods he doesn't like.  I have basically realized that any food he doesn't like he spits out.<br>  It is normal and I wouldn't worry about it.  There really isn't a way to teach them not to do it.  I would just let the parents know and ask them what they think is best for him.<br>  Good luck!|`|7jXChfBNaa	is it very likely that he just doesn't like the texture of the stage three food since it is more gritty and thick. he also might not like the flavor of whatever you have tried giving to him so i would just try to keep giving him the stage 2 baby food and very very slowly try introducing him to stage 3, if that's what you haven't done already. and maybe try with a few different flavors at the same time to see what he likes. you could also try mixing it with rice cereal to get him used to that gritty thick texture. i hope that helps and that you haven't already tried all of this lol.
QSodlfMraa	i think it is terrible and scary too, what with me being pregnant now, i worry about miscarriage at first but now, all i worry about is still birth, the list goes on, i just which there was a way so we would not have to worry so much.
lGSUToFQaa	well my hubby's mom is very controlling and i'm a very strong woman, so we clash everyday in every way, yes it is very true, i can't say how many of my clients would have been fine if they would just have let their kids be their own people instead of trying to control them constantly, it is crazy. <br>  <br>  my hubby is now 22 yrs old, and when we got married he was 20, he had never even paid a bill, bought a pair of jeans, nothing, his mom always did it cause she wanted to know it was done right and he dressed like she liked. <br>  <br>  i'm giving you a star and kudos cause you are right on the money, it is annoying, you are a freaking adult grow some balls or boobs and stand up to your parents. for real.|`|ykP7I3caaa	I know somebody who has very controlling parents and all of what you said is true. Especially the part about lacking confidence in themselves and their own decision making. She also doesn't know who she is and tries to copy whoever she thinks is cool. I'm not making fun of her, but they've squelched every little bit of originality that could have been. She has no inner voice. She's 17.|`|T864ejaiaa	not true. i make sure my kids do not do things to harm them self's or others. oh i know, i can always let my 15 year old say hey mom? i'm going out to get layed tonight so if i get prego you take care of it. grow up and face the real world girlie. life's to short to not to want to learn.|`|ghz5D5iLaa	I would have to agree with you. My sister did this to her child. The girl could not do anything on her own. She just turned 20 in December and she still cannot. She has a panic attack over everything and does not know what to do. she does not know how to do anything because her mother does it for her. They would not let her get a drivers license because she never drove. They got mad when I told them that it was their responsibility to take her to drive. <br>  <br>   The whole time the kids were growing up she kept telling me that I was pushing mine to grow up too fast. I did not feel that was true. Mine were growing up in the real world. They knew what was going on around them and how to deal with it. I did not shield them from the harsh realities. I think that is a problem. People do that and then complain because their kids won't grow up. They won't grow up because they don't know how.|`|r1hkyFmVaa	I disagree, my parents were very strict and very controlling. I'm grown now, and none of those statements apply to me or my siblings. We are grown, well-adjusted, educated, mature and successful adults.|`|8gA2EWXfaa	TOTALLY true!!!!!!!!!!!|`|60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	I have a controlling mother.  At the age of 32 years old, I still wear my hair a certain way or dress a certain way to please her at family gatherings.  I just assume not hear her comments.  That said, I have always been very independent and have no problem surviving in the real world.  So, no, not entirely true for all.|`|hKJIDdVqaa	I agree, an over protective controlling parent can hamper a child's development.  If children are not raised independent, and do not have to figure some things out for themselves they have no ideas in the 'real world' how to handle these situations.  There are times when parents DO know best for their child, but often times a child needs to make a mistake so that they learn and grow from the mistake.

Who is the parent here? It's not up to a 15 year old whether they go to school or not and it's your resposibility (morally and legally) to make sure she goes. It isn't optional and isn't negotiable. Do you want her to work at a fast food restaurant for the rest of her life? What lesson are you teaching her by allowing her to skip school? Get her in the car and take her.

Unless there is a medical indication, circumcision is completely unnecessary. Here in the UK circumcision is not so common, in the US it was a common trend. I am delighted to see that the circumcision rate is now declining in the US as more and more parents are now realising there is little need for this cruel and senseless procedure.<br>  <br>  I consider it to be child abuse, the child will feel some degree of pain. The foreskin is a birth right and we do NOT have the right to take away a child's choice at birth. If when the child becomes an adult he decides for himself that he wants to be circumcised then fair enough- that is his choice.<br>  <br>  Apart from religious reasons, prevention of certain diseases is the second most frequently used reason for circumcision. Evidence that circumcision is beneficial for health reasons is indeed very poor.The practice is mainly based on cultural traditions. I always try and base my answers on fact and scientific evidence. I have spent a great deal of time researching the actual evidence that some pro- circumcision supporters use. I will address these areas. Cancer of the penis is indeed very rare, SOME evidence suggests that circumcision offers a little protection from penile cancer if done in childhood, however the main factor in penile cancer is exposure to the Human Papilloma Virus. The fact is that Circumcised men are MORE at risk from penile warts than uncircumcised men, recent studies show that the risk of developing penile cancer is now almost equal in both groups. In view of this latest evidence, routine circumcision is NOT a justifiable method to prevent penile cancer<br>  <br>  A common myth is that yeast infections are more common in uncircumcised men, this is not true. The same instances of thrush occur in circumcised and uncircumcised men. STIs such as gonorrhea and non-gonococcal urethritis and penile warts is more common in circumcised men. The best method men can use to protect themselves from STIs is to use condoms and limit the amount of sexual partners one has. In view of this evidence, circumcision is NOT a justifiable method to prevent STIs<br>  <br>  A recent review in the British Journal of Urology concluded that there is no link between having an intact foreskin and HIV infection, thus circumcision is NOT justifiable as an HIV-preventive measure.<br>  <br>  Circumcision reduces penile sensitivity by up to 70% and most of all there is no real reasons to cut off body parts that do not belong to you. The foreskin does have a purpose- it protects the penis, much in the same way the female clitoral hood protects the clitoris. If the foreskin had no purpose, men simply would not be born with it. There is no valid argument for circumcision.<br>  <br>  EDIT<br>  I find this statement that some mothers above have given quite disturbing and illogical, "You're his mother it's your right and your choice" What about the CHILD'S RIGHTS? You may well have played a part of creating your child but that does not mean you have the right to take away his choice for INVALID DISPROVED reasons.|`|TsjqzanQaa	You didn't have your daughters or yourself circumcised, why would you mutilate a male?<br>  <br>  Male circumcision is male genital mutilation, just as much, if not moreso than female genital mutilation.<br>  <br>  Genital mutilation is genital mutilation, regardless of the sex of the victim.<br>  <br>  There are no benefits to circumcision, except to the doctors who make money from it, and the hospitals sell the amputated infants' foreskins for big bucks for use in cosmetics.<br>  <br>  You're a nervous wreck?

I was unable to achieve orgasm in normal sex as a result.<br>  <br>  I didn't know what was wrong with me for years, until I finally found out about foreskin restoration, which has vastly improved my sexual sensitivity and function.<br>  <br>  It will never be the same as if I hadn't been a victim of this atrocity, but at least it's far better than I was, and I can only imagine how it is to be left whoole and intact.<br>  <br>  Doctors NEVER disclose and in fact suppress the adverse effects and complications resulting from circumcision.

However, if you are expecting your son to go through the pain, the least you can do is be there to comfort him during the procedure. The truth is that circumcision is VERY painful to a baby. If you are going to have it done, you need to insist on a penile ring block for anesthesia. sugar water and anesthetic cream simply do not work. Even with the ring block for the procedure, your boy will be in pain after wards. The circumcision wound hurts the boy for several days to a week after the procedure. The pain is worse during urination and diaper changes. He may or may not be crying when he gets home. Many doctors wait until the baby has stopped crying before returning him to the parents. Don't trust your significant other or the doctor to tell you if your boy cried, they often say they didn't to make mother's feel better even if he screamed his head off. It takes about 2 weeks for the initial healing to take place, although his penis will take months to adjust to having an internal organ made external. Here's some more info on circ, with links, that you should be aware of-<br>  <br>  I would recommend NOT circumcising your son. The benefits do not outweigh the risks. One analysis found that for every 9 boys who might be spared a UTI by circumcision, another 12 boys at the least (the upper estimate was 40 boys) will experience severe complications from the circumcision. Thats great if your boy is one of the 9, but horrible if he's one of the 12. UTIs can be treated by antibiotics quite effectively. Botched circumcisions are much more difficult to fix. Its also worth noting that 99% of intact boys will never get an infection, compared to 99.9% of cut boys. That means you would have to cut 100 boys to save just one of them from infection. Thats 99 boys cut for no reason at all. Out of every 1000 boys who are cut, one will contract a UTI anyway.<br>  <br>  Only 50% of boys nationwide are circumcised. Girls of your son's generation will likely have an entirely different view of circumcision as girls from yours. Just because you think intact is "gross" and "unsanitary" does not mean the women of your son's generation will. after all, think of all the differences between you and your parents. Did you know that when your grandparents were young, circumcision was very uncommon?<br>  <br>  Next, it is VERY painful to an infant. Most doctors still don't use any anesthesia, those that do rarely offer adequate anesthesia because the only stuff that works is not safe enough to use in infants for such a "minor" procedure. Further, some of the pain meds offered to infants aren't even recommended for use on babies! Some doctors argue that it has been done "for thousands of years" without anesthetic- what they neglect to tell you is that a medical circumcision can take over 15 minutes to complete. A Jewish ritual circumcision, by contrast, takes under 60 seconds to complete (and the baby is given wine) Here is some info on the pain.....<br>  <a href="http://www.cirp.org/library/pain/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cirp.org/library/pain/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.circumcision.org/response.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.circumcision.org/response.htm</a><br>  <a href="http://www.cirp.org/library/pain/taddio2..." rel="nofollow">http://www.cirp.org/library/pain/taddio2...</a> (note in this one that even infants offered pain meds for the procedure showed signs of post traumatic stress!)<br>  <br>  You should also know that studies have shown that the most sensitive parts of the male anatomy of ON the foreskin- NOT the head of the penis. By cutting off the foreskin, you remove a mans most erogenous genital tissue. Here is a study about that.... (note that other studies found no difference, but they neglected to test the sensitivity of the foreskin- they only tested the glans penis of intact and cut men and didn't pay any attention to the foreskin at all) <a href="http://www.nocirc.org/touch-test/touchte..." rel="nofollow">http://www.nocirc.org/touch-test/touchte...</a><br>  <br>  You should know that infant boys are EASIER to care for when they are intact. The foreskin does not retract until late childhood or even puberty, so you do nothing special, just wipe the outside of his penis clean and leave it alone. Furthermore, to prevent painful and bleeding erections later in life, doctors are now commonly leaving more skin behind- in a cut boy this means you may have to push the left over skin back at every diaper change and clean beneath it to prevent it from adhering or infecting. The very thing that mother's think they avoid by circumcising! In short- Intact = wipe like a finger, NEVER retract Cut= vaseline, clean thoroughly, push back remaining skin to prevent adhesions etc (the last step perhaps for several months or years)<br>  <br>  Here is an excellent tutorial on the basics of intact care and circumcision....<br>  <a href="http://www.lactivistintactivist.com/?pag..." rel="nofollow">http://www.lactivistintactivist.com/?pag...</a><br>  <br>  Another factor in your decision is that circumcised boys experience a 12% increase in their risk of MRSA infection. MRSA is commonly picked up in hospitals (where circumcision is performed in non-sterile conditions) and has been known to kill adults. I wouldn't want to deal with it in an infant. 12% is a BIG risk, the risk of a boy "needing" a circ later in life is WELL below that- under 1%. <a href="http://www.nocirc.org/publish/12-Answers..." rel="nofollow">http://www.nocirc.org/publish/12-Answers...</a><br>  <br>  The so called "benefits" of circumcision are generally trumped up. A big one now is that it "prevents" AIDS. All the studies showing "benefits" like this have been poorly designed and inconclusive. Also, for every study that finds a "benefit" there are more studies that find no benefit. <a href="http://www.icgi.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.icgi.org/</a><br>  <br>  It is rather eye-opening to see how circumcision first became popular in the US to begin with.

Tie his arms and legs down and perform this useless cosmetic procedure without pain medication or likely before it takes effect. Your baby will probably react as most do. He will withdraw into a deep sleep ~ the bodies compensating mechanism in times of extreme stress and pain. He will wake crying and uncomfortable and will scream every time you change his diaper for two weeks following. Later in life he will live a sexual life with at least 20% less feeling in his wiener than uncircumcised men. Just imagine how much more sensitive the tip of the penis would be if it were covered by a layer of skin 99% of the time.<br>  <br>  I did not circumcise my son who is now 8. I am not and have never been afraid of germs. I never pulled it down to clean ~ or at least rarely and many summers my son showered every other day.

It is not medically necessary, and the very few UTI's that it prevents are negated by the rate of complications. People say that it is easier to clean, but that is NOT the case! With an natural penis, you just wipe like a finger, but with a circumcised one, you have to have gauze, Vaseline, push back skin to prevent adhesion's, and think about it... a fresh wound being soaked in urine and feces all day?!?!?!?!?!?!<br>  <br>  The main reason you hear about boys needing to get circumcised at 3 or 4 is because of misinformation. Some old school doctors and nurses tell you that you have to forcibly retract the foreskin and clean under it every diaper change. not only is that not true, it is dangerous! At birth, and sometimes until puberty, the foreskin is attatched to the head of the penis like your fingernail is to your finger. It is NOT supposed to be retracted. It is like this in order to keep the head of the penis protected from urine and feces. Around the time a boy is potty trained, most boys are retractable. (you can pull the foreskin back) is this a coincidence? NO!!! There is no need to clean under the foreskin before it can be retracted because nothing can get under it. Do we need to clean under our fingernails? (the part that is actually attatched) no, because there is nothing to clean.<br>  <br>  It is becoming less common is America, so the locker room thing just wont hold up. Even if he does get made fun of for it, is it not our job as parents to build a healthy body image? If your daughter got made fun of for having small breast, would you immediately get her a breast augmentation? What are they making fun of anyway? At least he has a whole penis.... they are the ones that are missing parts<br>  <br>  One of the worst things you can do as a mother, is give your child cosmetic surgery to make them "fit in". Basically, you are saying, there is something wrong with you, you had to be fixed, and you should base your self esteem on what others think of you". Actions speak louder than words you know. If you are doing it because "That is what everyone else is doing" All I am going to say is, don't ever say no to your kids when they want to do something that is harmful to their health and they just want to fit in. Kids come home drunk or high? No problem, they just wanted to be "normal", You don't want them to be teased do you?????<br>  <br>  Looking like daddy, now this one makes me laugh! Ah, the ignorance of this statement! Since when do toddler boys look even remotely close to a grown man? What are you gonna tell him when he asks like he doesn't look like mommy or sissy??? And since when do teenagers compare penises with their father? This argument makes NO sense!!!<br>  <br>  Boys can stay STD free with the use of a condom (which he should be using regardless of his circ status!) and still have his foreskin.<br>  <br>  The foreskin is not just a useless flap of skin, it is a vital structure of the penis. <a href="http://www.sexasnatureintendedit.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sexasnatureintendedit.com/</a><br>  <br>  If people are so worried about infections, HIV, and Cancer, the why why don't we give all baby girls routine mastectomies? That would eradicate breast cancer, which kills thousands every year, and is MUCH MUCH more common in the developed world than infections of the foreskin, penile cancer, and HIV put together!<br>  <br>  The real kicker for me though, was the fact that I believe that we own our own bodies. Who am I to make that decision for my son. It is HIS penis, so it is HIS decision<br>  <br>  As for religion, no one has the right to practice their religion on MY body. Your freedom of religion ends at someone elses body. That may be your child, but it is not your penis to sacrifice, kwim? What if your son doesn't grow up to be jewish/muslim? I was raised in a strict christain home and I am now atheist, it happens all the time...|`|W2z5dCrmaa	Your boy will arrive as intended..complete per design with the best possible evolution or design..you pick which. The foreskin will be fused to the glans leaving you with the simple task of wiping it off like a finger and wiping the opening tip with a wipe a baby wipe. <br>  <br>  If you didn't have your labia cut off from yourself and your daughters, then don't circumcise you sons... It's the same nerve group and the same result. More damaging however because the clitoris still won't rub on everything like the glans will...that too would be equal.<br>  <br>  Nature came up with the best design for a penis where the glans..(head) of the penis is designed to be an internal organ as with most male creatures, where the sensing receptors of the glans is protected and kept from becoming dried desensitized regular skin. The foreskin is designed to slide back and expose the most feeling full parts during sexual activity <br>  and cover then again after for protection. Just like the eye lid protects the eyeball from being damaged by environmental contact, so does the foreskin to the glans.<br>  <br>  There are no benefits to circumcision...only damage to future experiences to the male. I'm totally thankful to my parents for havin the wisdom to keep me the way that I arrived because of my early 22 year old marriage experiences that would have been far damaged otherwise.<br>  <br>  For an infant, it's remote to consider a sex life, but that is the total reason for having a penis. For peeing, a little hole anywhere in the body would work just fine.<br>  <br>  The reasons for circumcision and the tradition in the US was based on the warped Victorian aspect of hindering boy masturbation, and the idea of damaging male sensitivity to reduce their level of pleasure. Lame excuses have been made ever since to try to support it and the medical world declares that it's unnecessary surgery.<br>  <br>  Check ..the history of circumcision on the web and do so on You Tube as well....an eye opener. <br>  <br>  Circumcision a very negative and traumatic thing, yet someone here considers not being supportive of it as a negative attitude...."warped reasoning".<br>  <br>  The rest of the world aside from Jewish and Islamic people do not circumcise and the US is now down to 50 %.<br>  <br>  Tell your doctor no, and save your self his easy money which is another part behind this damaging torture.<br>  <br>  Your son will thank you like I thank my parents.<br>  <br>  I see law suits in the future by sons who were damaged in their ..to them most important parts... while helpless and unable to defend themselves.

Not to mention that the supposed pros to being circumcised are a bunch of horse sh*t. All the crap about STD's.

There is also a small possibility that things can go drastically wrong:<br>  <a href="http://www.catholicsagainstcircumcision.org/cac_complications.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.catholicsagainstcircumcision....</a><br>  There is also evidence that the pain and discomfort of circumcision disrupts the mother-son bond and also breast feeding. Some evidence suggests the trauma of circumcision has long-term psychological effects.<br>  <br>  So why not keep him intact? There is no care at all for an intact boy. A few things you need to remember:<br>  The foreskin is attached to the glans at birth (they have to break this seel to perform the circumcision - this is excruciatingly painful - not that the pain is the worst part of circumcision )<br>  You should never pull back the foreskin or try to clean under it. It requires no care.<br>  The foreskin should be left to become retractable on it's own , it should not be forced. The ability to retract it occurs any time up until the end of puberty.<br>  Once it becomes retractable, there is little care - just wash it like any other body part. It is not dirty - if it was then women would be a lot dirtier. Most men worldwide are intact and have no problems.<br>  <a href="http://www.cirp.org/pages/parents/care/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cirp.org/pages/parents/care/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.cirp.org/library/normal/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cirp.org/library/normal/</a>
oXzHvsBpaa	My son is almost 4 months old also. He does have reflux and has had it since he was only a few weeks old. My son does sleep on his stomach. Its the only position that he will sleep in. We bought a Movement Monitor because I was worried about him sleeping on his stomach and the risk of SIDS. Basically is sets off an alarm if he stops breathing. I have yet to have a false alarm. My son loves sleeping on his stomach. I don't see anything wrong with it as long as there isn't any blankets in the crib. He can already roll over from stomach to back.|`|UghJ0XROaa	My reflux baby has been on her belly since a few weeks old. On her back, propped up, any other way she would be up within 45 min on a good stretch. It was just getting bad, we put her on her belly, first night- SIX HOURS! And she has been there since.|`|V6slDthdaa	Ditto here. My daughter has severe reflux and can only sleep comfy on her belly. I agree with the first post, buy a movement monitor if you want to be put at ease about SIDS. If her doc is okay with it, and it works, I don't see a problem.|`|e01ge0W6aa	Yep, sleeps on stomach or her side. I also bought an angelcare movement monitor to ease my mind. You can also try elevating the crib mattress to keep her somewhat elevated so the acids stay down.
prqrQcd1aa	Yes it will show her brain as well, depending on how much radiation they use to do the CT scan it may show her bones and brain. The fontanelle's are sections of your skull that allow you to pass through the birth canal. There are usually 2 of them (that can be felt at birth), one in the front and one in the back, though there are actually more than that!  I'll wiki some more information for you on them. They are also known as the "soft spots"<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fontanelle" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fontanelle</a>|`|KSUPtqCaaa	A C-T can show brain matter as well as bone; but in this case, I'd imagine they are looking at the ventricles of the brain; and specifically for enlarged ventricles.<br>  <br>  I hope things turn out well!<br>  <br>  Cheers|`|zH1sg3Xraa	A scan shows the bone structure and also all of the brain.|`|4WyUrWaIaa	The CT scan shows the brain as well.|`|SnQvsOPwaa	It only has to do with the bones. Depending on what your doctor ordered will be the areas that they will scan. It will pick up bits and pieces of the surrounding areas.
KEu8nqEQaa	You can't get a faint negtaive line...if you get a line at all it is a faint positive. I got a faint one last week and tested again two days later and it was much darker. Good Luck!|`|af2136bcacd19dc5b2bab9b0737163c9aa	I tested with first response a few months back and I got a faint positive thinking i was prego I went to the doctor just to find out i wasn't! :( big bummer :( I really thought I was pregnant because I was a wk late..
VPmHIvtJaa	Jesus, no.<br>  If he's not used to this, he will think you are a psycho mum and probaly be scared to look at you in the eye ever again.<br>  LOL<br>  <br>   I'm a 16 year old, and I've had my fair share of spankings, but when I was a young child..<br>  Instead of spanking, maybe give him a stern talking to, don't shout, just act very intimidating, and maybe deprive him from a luxury for a week.. e.g "Mobile, internet".<br>  <br>  He'd be more likely to behave if you took something away from him that he likes, than if you give him a spanking which will probaly not even hurt the guy.<br>  <br>  x|`|AA12020110	This sounds like a 'troll' question from  A kid with an  interest in spanking or being spanked.  Kind of mild porn. A fantasy.   this question probably should be deleted  The give away is " and I spank my 16 yr old son and his friends."  _NO_ parent gives another adult permission to 'spank' teen children.  <br>  <br>  Kids attempt at porn.|`|CGBWxtAjaa	You have no right to spank him or his friends.<br>  He is a 16 yrs old that's sick!|`|imFOUAMcaa	if he curses u out or even try to fight you back dont be at all shock or surprise|`|876e05e5fb4225d5d27c03023eb578b5aa	I agree that seeing your son naked is a little awkward knowing that he's 16...but anywho, parents are all different. My opinion is that you shouldn't have to "spank" your child if theyre 16.  I think that's a little too old for "spanking"...and that you should be able to talk to him about what he has done wrong and him know that it's wrong.  I also think that you should be a little careful with the whole "spanking" thing cuz kids now days aren't afraid of telling certain people about what happens at home and it could get you into trouble.  So depending on the situation, i think talking would be better, i think he should be mature enough to be talked to and to know that he shouldn't yell back or anything when talked to.|`|aOCfLAJJaa	Lier, lier, pants on fire.<br>  <br>  IT'S SEXUAL ASSAULT TO HIT HIS FRIENDS ON THE BUTTOCKS.|`|FKMpr292aa	you just said his stepmom is dead but in teh title it ays your his stepmom.. TROLL!|`|Z1FdawAOaa	Okay first off you have NO business spanking someone else's children even if they give you permission too. secondly i don't think you should spank your step son he is technically not your child so you have no business laying a hand on him. leave that up to his father.|`|iAfmejYTaa	i agree with anna. this question is very see thru and i see that ur a freak.|`|ClBkTdOEaa	okay...it's kinda weird that you've seen him naked...but I don't know the story so anyway. I don't think you should spank him. He is 16 and it wouldn't really hurt. I think punishment hurts worse because at 16 he wants to hangout but if he behaves badly he shouldn't be allowed and that will really make him think twice before doing whatever it was, again. Also when you yell at them it is way more annoying than being slapped. If you smack them it will be funny to him because he is so old. He would probably laugh in your face so don't smack him...ground him.|`|abcef21f35c1b7e1c21c4f95d70f6632aa	GOD lady get a clue!!!!!!!   You take away privileges and material things he has in his room,  spank him???  don't be an idiot,  this is not your job and you need to back off.  This kids has got to think you are nuts so that is the first problem,  he has no respect for you,  now you need to get a book on raising a stepchild and what your boundaries are and what is appropriate for you and what is not,  spanking is not especially a 16 year old.  I would say if you are seriously asking this question you need counseling with this.  This kids has lost his mother, he does not need another one he needs a female role model.  Being a step parent is hard and if you really want to do a good job,  learn how from a therepist
uFrqC4Y2aa	DO one of those digital tests. I took a clearblue easy. You will get a clear pregnant or not pregnant reading. I think you're pregnant though.|`|3X0t8JrXaa	If the test had 2 lines it doesn't matter how faint.  The first test may have been a false negative because it was taken too soon.  I took a test and got a negative then 3 days later got a faint plus sign...took a blood test was as pregnant as can be.  If you really aren't confident with the results you can always take a blood test to find out with a shadow of a doubt.|`|5RvTXdmUaa	YES, any line, light or dark means you are. As long as you followed the directions on the package. Evaporation lines show up after 10 minutes but if you read yours within the right time frame, then yes you are pregnant. CONGRATTTS!!!!|`|77Zt3gn9aa	Yes it does.  I took a couple of tests where one line was dark and the other was really faint.  29 weeks later i'm pregnant.  I then took a digital test to confirm.|`|XYBHM8aSaa	Yes, you could be pregnant.  <br>  <br>  Go to the drugstore and buy another test.  Then you will know for sure.|`|BO28Mn8haa	definitely pregnant. when did you miss your period? the one last week could of been too early|`|NZid2d1Paa	Yeah sounds to me that you are, I had all of these symptoms. The tender breasts, tired, acid reflux, and the color change of your nipples or around them, And if you do see that extra line even if its faint, that means you are, there is rarely any false positives on a test.  Congrats and Good luck!|`|ptwnCWloaa	If your test showed positive, then yes.  It doesn't matter how strong the lines are.  I'm pregnant now and I took 2 tests that both showed weak lines.  It's unlikely to give you a false positive.  The first one you took may have just been too early.|`|ygzYphCqaa	yes if the test had two lines then yes you are pregnant.<br>  i would go to the doctor to get a blood test. <br>  the test you took a week ago must of been too early to tell.|`|jBdvUQEXaa	I would say pregnant. Congratulations :-)<br>  <br>  Two lines no matter how faint or different they are means pregnant! Kind of early for the changes in nipple colours though.<br>  <br>  Claure|`|a1uoxczTaa	pregnant
SEzIkGNiaa	"pubic"?  I think holding hands, hugs and pecks are fine to display in public.|`|ANHsv4ENaa	Sure as long as it's not slobbering all over, throat swabbing kisses and dry humping. I love to see youngsters all cuddly and kissy. It's so sweet. Makes me remember when I was a teenager. Which sucked actually so it makes me glad they look so happy and innocent.|`|Qfq4lpe7aa	I think PDA other than holding hands or a peck kiss is too much for anyone groping and things of that nature are disgusting and should be left for the bedroom or inside your home not for the world to see...|`|NeTNnvSZaa	I don't think the rule should be any different for children than it is for adults.  Hand holding, a peck on the cheek etc. all ok in my book.  As parent's we have to get over this, do as I say, not as I do attitude.|`|hKJIDdVqaa	no, I do not. Children should be more concerned with their school work and studies, not making out.  It is completely ignorant and I certainly do not want my young men and lady seeing that type of behavior.|`|SnQvsOPwaa	funny-- NO!|`|iu4SOin3aa	I think its they're business.<br>  Different people show affection differently.<br>  Some older couples dont even hold hands in public.<br>  <br>  <br>  Go ahead and do the thumbs down. Just keep in mind that your opinion isnt always the right one. Everyone feels differently about certain things.|`|gJrHBtp1aa	I don't consider PDA's appropriate for anyone. I don't mind seeing holding hands or quick kisses, but I hate seeing people having a make out session and groping. (at any age)|`|WdW1ga14aa	Holding hands, and a little peck kiss every now and then is ok but anything more then that in Public is not appropriate for anyone let alone a teenager.|`|85vDqn6naa	No i think there is an appropriate time and place for everything, but hand holding is ok!|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	holding hands is fine, a peck on the cheek is fine, a hug is fine... anything else is not|`|Ki6jlwnbaa	Holding hands, a little peck. NOT dry humping and making out.|`|T864ejaiaa	NO!!!!!|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	no..does love disturb you?|`|1315a885190b13c29652133c95ee8c2caa	I DO think it is appropriate for teenagers as long as they're not going to the extreme, i think people should be able to show there feelings no matter where they are. I think if kids are taught not to show public affection in other words there being told to not express themselves. So yes i think its fine to a certain extent.|`|130816e5bf662924b68497e6577df429aa	Holding hands, yes. Pawing at each other, breathing down each others necks, no. It disgusts me to see teenagers walking around groping each other in places that only the doctor should see. That said, I also think it's inappropriate for married people to grope each other in public. Save it for the bedroom.|`|cteyFJxhaa	No more so than adults.  There's a time and place for everything.  I have no problem with public displays of "affection" from anyone of any age.  I think it's beautiful to see a pretty young girl being swung around in circles by the boy she "loves" as they laugh and enjoy being young and "in love".  Remember that feeling??????<br>  <br>  Now public displays of "lust" are another thing entirely.  I just don't want to see that ever!|`|fBso80Ubaa	I think it's OK up to a limit.  Things like hugging, kissing on the cheek, and shoulder massages are perfectly fine, even "sweet".  But French kissing (a.k.a. making out or snogging) shouldn't be done in school hallways, in public parks when there are kids around, or in shopping malls.  French kissing is a borderline sexual act, and has a time and a place.  Of course, it's best to do that somewhere private.  It's also OK on the dance floor in night clubs or to an extent, in movie theaters (but sit in the back if you do that).|`|xApAWlshaa	In school i guess holding hands hugging maybe a peck.But when you straight out have sex on the scoence table its pretty disturbing.no one wants to see the rubbing thee booties against eachother.and i defenintley dont like the booty smacking its disrespectful to all women.the woman its done to and the women who have to watch|`|6D4MqIrxaa	I'm a teenager, and i think its gross. There is a FINE line. Yes, kissing and hugging briefly doesn't bug me nor does holding hands. But i think its so gross to see kids at school groping each other or acting inappropriately. I guess, it just depends on what they are actually doing.|`|fMvP3BIFaa	well im 20 and I have never been very affectionate in public. The most i'll do is a small peck. But full blown make out sessions for anyone are inappropiate. There is a time and place for everything.|`|Mapm6AI8aa	if ur a mom or dad, realize that children do this without permission, so u might as well give them the permission. i myself am a 12 yr old.|`|Tj0A8f8Taa	Lol
DDFSITiYaa	A lot of the answers are 'could be' and truly, you'll never know for sure.  But yes, a habit of eating at a certain time can form and even just a habit of falling back to sleep while eating.  Usually by 9 months, they are taking in enough calories during the day to forego the nightfeeds.  Waking is common but eating is the habit.|`|qMYbGqiwaa	My 7 month old was doing this- and I just stopped feeding her at night because I knew she was not hungry-it was just a habit.  <br>  <br>  So here is what I did:When she cried at night I would give her a pacifier and turn on her music and walk out of the room.  I won't lie- for about a week I was up about 10 times a night comforting her, but now it is so worth it.  She has been sleeping 12 hours a night for 3 weeks now and it is great.  I make sure she eats about 1/2 a cup of baby cereal with dinner and then I give her a 6 oz bottle at 7pm and she's down for the night at 7:30.  Good Luck!|`|oA8Rtyxuaa	They could be going through a growth spurt so they are getting hungry in the night. If you are willing to lose some sleep, try giving them a bottle of water and see if it is purely something to soothe them back to sleep, if they are Truly hungry they won't go back to sleep. Twins I'm assuming, you need your sleep, i know :) I nanny for twins, I can't imagine getting up with them at night lol|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	If you generally eat at noon you will tend to feel hungry and eat at noon.  That being said while you are in the habit of eating at noon that doesn't mean you aren't really hungry and while you could get into the habit of eating at 11am or 2 pm there is certainly a limit to how far apart you can push meals without feeling hungry.<br>  <br>  And while its true that you possible could teach your baby/babies not to eat when they wake at 12-2am that doesn't mean they will no longer wake, even if you were to manage to stop them being hungry at this time.<br>  <br>  Babies wake up, far more often then most parents admit.  Its not abnormal for a 9 month old to be waking several times a night -hungry or not and whether you choose to feed them or not.<br>  <br>  The only questions of any importance are:<br>  *Are your babies well rested, happy, and healthy<br>  *Are you ok with their current schedule: or are you resentful, tired, and miserable.<br>  <br>  If everyone is happy then there is no sleep problem.  If you are miserable the best thing to do is make sure that its not because you are simply trying to live up to unrealistic expectations -changing your outlook is the least invasive thing to do.  The next thing is to make sure mom is getting enough sleep and that mom is getting enough emotional and actual support.  Catching up on some rest or going to bed a bit earlier are easy fixes.  And if you aren't getting emotional and actual help (I mean dishes, etc) no amount of changing your babies sleep habits is going to change that.  If nothing is working then ask the baby/babies to change.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.naturalchild.org/tine_thevenin/need_vs_habit.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.naturalchild.org/tine_theveni...</a><br>  We are born needing. We have need for air, food, sleep, and shelter. We have need for intellectual and physical stimulation. We have a need to be loved and touched.2 If any of these needs goes fully or even partially unattended, the person hurts; and in the case of an emotional wound, the person may spend the rest of his life struggling to soothe the initial hurt.3<br>  <br>  Gesell argues that a child passes through predictable stages of development at predictable times.4 Thus what might seem to become a habit, may be simply a gratification of a need.<br>  <br>  Hymes, in his book Child under Six, describes a habit as an action which can easily be broken. "If you run into any major difficulty at all," he writes, "Beware! You are probably not dealing with an old outworn habit. The chances are that you are tampering with a human need."5<br>  <br>  If the body indicates a need for food, treating it like a habit and disregarding it will not make the hunger go away.

It is much more an issue of culture and lifestyle and expectations. Here are three approaches to parenting issues:<br>  <br>      * Forcing baby to change to fit the parent's lifestyle is one approach. Our American culture tends not to be very baby friendly, and rarely makes accommodations for nursing babies. The current trend, seen in many popular books and parenting magazines, is to force baby to do all of the accommodating so that we experience as little change in our pre-baby lifestyle as possible; for example, baby MUST sleep through the night so that we get unbroken sleep and a "good" baby is seen as one who makes as few demands on his parents as possible.<br>      * Another approach is to try to approximate the mothering style of traditional societies and let the parents do all the accommodating. This approach can be very difficult to pull off without lots of support and changes of expectations in the people around us.<br>      * A third approach is to do as much accommodating on the parental side as possible, and then to "ask" baby to accommodate the last part of the gap. This is an approach that can work for many families. With this approach, parents do all they can to be sensitive to their baby's needs, and only ask baby to accommodate when nothing else truly works. <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  But if one is in the habit of putting his keys in his right pocket, there need be only a worn-out pocket to change the habit from putting the keys in right to the left pocket.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.drjaygordon.com/development/ap/sleep.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.drjaygordon.com/development/a...</a><br>  I don't recommend any forced sleep changes during the first year of life. Probably the only exception to this would be an emergency involving a nursing mom's health. There are many suggestions in books and magazines for pushing "sleeping through the night" during a baby's early months or during the first year. I don't think this is the best thing to do and I am quite sure that the earlier a baby gets "non-response" from parents, the more likely he is to close down at least a little<br>  <br>  <a href="http://askdrsears.com/html/7/T070200.asp" rel="nofollow">http://askdrsears.com/html/7/T070200.asp</a><br>  NIGHTTIME PARENTING LESSON #4:<br>  An important fact for you to remember is that your baby's sleep habits are more a reflection of your baby's temperament rather than your style of nighttime parenting. And keep in mind that other parents usually exaggerate how long their baby sleeps, as if this were a badge of good parenting, which it isn't. It's not your fault baby wakes up.<br>  <br>  8. Babies still wake up. When babies mature into these adult-like sleep patterns varies among babies. Yet, even though babies achieve this sleep maturity some time during the last half of the first year, many still wake up. The reason? Painful stimuli, such as colds and teething pain, become more frequent. Major developmental milestones, such as sitting, crawling, and walking, drive babies to "practice" their new developmental skills in their sleep. Then between one and two years of age, when baby begins to sleep through the above-mentioned wake-up stimuli, other causes of nightwaking occur, such as separation anxiety and nightmares.<br>  <br>  Even though you understand why babies are prone to nightwaking, you realize it's still important for parents and babies to get a restful night's sleep, otherwise, baby, the parents, and their relationship won't thrive. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.drjen4kids.com/soap%20box/sleep%20stuff.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.drjen4kids.com/soap%20box/sle...</a><br>  Normal babies sleep during the day and are up at night, at least for the first several (6-8) weeks.  That is normal and expected and nothing we can do to change that.  That means that parents need to sleep when the baby is sleeping to avoid all the great things that go along with sleep deprivation.  Older infants get up at night, but less often, and it is normal for one year olds to not be sleeping through the night.  Of course, if I did my job earlier, you now understand that nobody sleeps through the night.  Interesting tidbit: about 80% of parents of one year olds identify their children as having "sleep problems."  Eighty percent?  Maybe we have an expectation for our children that is not based on human physiology and is therefore not realistic. Maybe they don't really have a sleep problem.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://kellymom.com/parenting/sleep/sleepstudies.html" rel="nofollow">http://kellymom.com/parenting/sleep/slee...</a><br>  "However, even in the 12-month-old group, 50% of infants typically required parental intervention to get back to sleep after waking"<br>  Goodlin-Jones BL, et al.

The researchers surveyed 3269 parents, with a 96.5% response rate, over a one week period. The parents had to report on their child's sleeping habits over the past 24 hours, plus answer a few questions related to their perceptions of their child's sleep behavior.<br>  <br>  What did they find?<br>  <br>      * There is a wide range of normal childhood sleep behavior.<br>      * Circadian rhythm is not well established until four months of age.<br>      * Daytime sleep becomes less regular with increasing age, the most marked reduction in length occurs around 3 months of age. However, a surprising 11% under 3 months of age don't have a daytime sleep every day.<br>      * Frequent night waking that disturbs parents is common from 4-12 months (12.7% disturb their parents 3 or more times every night).<br>      * Night time settling requires more parental input from 18 months.<br>      * Nearly a third of parents have a significant problem with their child's sleep behavior.<br>      * Sleeping through the night: 71.4% did this on at least one occasion by 3 months of age, but many of these relapse into more frequent waking in the 4 to 12 month period. It is not until after 24 months that regular night waking (requiring attention) becomes much less common.<br>  <br>  Although this study did not address breastfeeding, it is relevant because a lack of understanding of "normal" sleep patterns can lead to supplementing, early solids, belief there is not enough milk, etc. The authors claim it also leads to misdiagnosis of gastro-esophageal reflux (GER) and overuse of sedative medication.

My son, who was sleeping through, has recently returned to night feedings after being sick too (he's 8 months.)<br>  <br>  I am feeding him at night and tweaking his day time eating schedule a bit.  I know he's capable of eating enough during the day not to be hungry at night, but if he is hungry I feed him.<br>  <br>  Something to try is to create a longer interval between the second to last meal of the day, and the last.  This worked the first time around, I am hoping it will work this time.  It takes a few days though.

Its a seat they sit in that keeps them secure in the tub.  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.do?product_id=7977227&sourceid=1500000000000003260330&ci_src=14110944&ci_sku=7977227" rel="nofollow">http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.d...</a>|`|EeGgovyCaa	Mine are a bit older than your baby so they bath pretty easy. I let them play in the tub together while I sit on the toilet in front of the tub. When it comes to washing them, I dump a bucket of water on their heads or I dunk them (not their face, just to the hair line) to rinse. <br>  <br>  Getting them both in the tub is more exhausting when I'm by myself because I can't leave one to get the other changed. So I have to do that in the bathroom. but it saves alot of time then doing it separately.|`|BypjotRpaa	i used to bathe him in the (clean) kitchen sink until he was about your sons age. we have a deep single kitchen sink. and then i started bathing him in the tub. i used to put a little plastic step stool in the tub to sit on. now he is 1, i now sit on the edge of the tub feet in the water and wash him and then i sit on the toilet and watch him play.<br>  i also have a huge no slip mat in the tub,but when he tries to stand up, i grab his arm and sit him back down.|`|pXSKSS3daa	I sit him in the tub and then sit down by the side of it(not in it) and bathe him that way. Or I sit on the toilet since it's right next to the tub.<br>  <br>  Have you tried getting a no slip mat and putting in the bottom of the tub? That may help him not slide around so much. They also make bath seats that hook onto the edge of the tub: <a href="http://www.toysrus.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2969577&CAWELAID=139132539" rel="nofollow">http://www.toysrus.com/product/index.jsp...</a>|`|CVdcrY3kaa	My daughter sits in our tub by herself and I lean over and wash her. As long as I have her bath toys surrounding her she doesn't wiggle that much, and she absolutely loves having the water poured on her...so bath time is fun in our house!|`|T0gv52CDaa	With my first son, he used to HATE getting a bath until I started just bringing him in the tub with me.  Once he got used to taking a bath with me, he was more willing to bathe with just him in the tub.  At two, he now loves the bath so much that it is hard to get him to get out.  With my now 4 month old, I just sit the baby tub on the kitchen counter and bathe him there.  Occasionally if I'm upstairs and decide that it is bath time, I'll bathe him in the bathroom sink.  I just find that bathing him in something that is at least waste height is more comfortable for me than bending over the tub when I don't have to.|`|lnsOJ3GBaa	Any of the above that you mentioned would be fine. I use to put just a couple of inches of water in the tub when my kids where 8 months and let them go to town. I'd sit by the tub and talk with them and wash them while they played in the water with thier wash clothes and cups. I have been known to use a clean kitchen sink it's just not as fun for them. Bathing with you're baby offers you some quality bonding time that's sometimes hard to find the the hustle and bustle of raising our children. Good Luck to you and God Bless|`|174a0c67c52bf2d640d056db3d05e137aa	when my daughter was born she was in the sink until she was to big for it. then i would get something like this <a href="http://www.target.com/Munchkin-Duck-Bathtub/dp/B000066665/sr=1-6/qid=1236184852/ref=sr_1_6/177-8998216-2855461?ie=UTF8&frombrowse=0&index=target&rh=k:bath%20tub%20duck&page=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.target.com/Munchkin-Duck-Bath...</a> or some thing like this <a href="http://www.target.com/dp/B000067EH7/ref=sc_qi_detailbutton?ie=UTF8&pf_rd_r=1MZFPS91MDD8FPCG10P7&pf_rd_p=465357931&pf_rd_i=B000067EH7&pf_rd_s=bottom-6&pf_rd_m=A1VC38T7YXB528&pf_rd_t=5101" rel="nofollow">http://www.target.com/dp/B000067EH7/ref=...</a>  good luck now my daughter is 3 and is fine in the bath tub.|`|iFDye9RMaa	We jump in the shower with our daughter, since we do not have a tub! We tried to use the baths that fit over the kitchen sink, but she hated it, she would cry and squirm the entire time. The shower is just sooo much easier. I think If I had an actual bathtub, I would jump in with her. It would be easier I think that leaning over and breaking my back or worring about her splashing about and soaking me. :)|`|DzPZ8EEkaa	We used to get in with our son too.  It was safer and also a sweet bonding time just before bed.  You need to be willing to accept the fact that you're most likely taking a little pee pee bath because let's face it, they aren't holding it and that warm water well....you know, hahahaha!  Anyway, if you would rather not get in, try using one of those plastic step stools for kids that you can find at any baby supply type store.  That's what we started doing after we quit co-bathing.  Good luck.|`|AA11916244	Apparently those round ones that sucker to the bottom of the tub arent safe but i did find this new version. <br>  <a href="http://www.burlingtoncoatfactory.com/IWCatProductPage.process?Section_Id=36858&Product_Id=326308&Sku1=k_s1_71408110&is_baby_depot=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.burlingtoncoatfactory.com/IWC...</a>|`|AA11779376	Mine isn't born yet but I'm going to get this <a href="http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.do?product_id=4664293" rel="nofollow">http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.d...</a> It has great reviews and it looks comfy for the baby. it also won't be a pain like the baby baths are.|`|20542bc530ff16912f465f7abd18306eaa	Um I fill the tub up a little and sit him in there then I lean over and bathe him lol I guess I break my back.|`|AA11210211	When they were little I used a little seat in the kitchen sink but as soon as they started sitting up and crawling I just set them in the bath tub and lean over to wash them.I used a little seat like the one Pumpkin's Mommy showed you with my son but quit after he tipped it over,the thingy on the side of the bath tub came off and over he went.
CKnHMYHnaa	They will probably want to do a non-stress test on the baby to make sure he/she isn't in any disstress.  If all is well, they may not have a problem with letting you go past your due date.  For another week or so at least.|`|ROJans2Taa	I was 39 weeks and 1 -2 cm and my doc offered to strip my membranes it worked and I delivered 17 hrs later, usually if the baby is looking fine they wait till 40+ weeks, your doc will probably give you options and let you know when they will consider it, each doc is different some induce right away others wait till close to 42, if they dont mention it, id bring it up, it's possible to do most your dilation in a short time, so you may go into labor at any time even though your not dilated very far. best luck
dNlCfhD2aa	If it has only been 4 days the egg (if you ARE pregnant) may not have even implanted yet.  So no, you won't be feeling any symptoms yet.  Give it 10 or 12 days.|`|963a60ad2fe21d7cef6dc7185c595623aa	You won't have symptoms that soon.  If you do, it is just anxiety or wishful thinking depending on whether you want to be pregnant or not.|`|dv70AWh0aa	i got symptoms maybe a week after conception.<br>  i started feeling really nausious, and i had this horrible cramping in my stomach.<br>  it kind of felt like a burning every once in a while, it still does now.<br>  and at the beginning i had to always have a snack with me, because i'd start feeling really sick and i had to eat something to make it go away.<br>  you're breasts will also get really sore if you are pregnant.<br>  i felt like i got kicked by a horse in the chest!<br>  good luck
EtCRnDJMaa	does it really matter if she has on the shorts & vest....you pick the battles.   This is not that big of deal.  she wont die will she?  <br>  <br>  If you are having trouble with your sister, then she knows what's going on, (your niece) just because she's 5 doesn't mean she's clueless.  <br>  <br>  I think she is just trying to see what she can get away with...she's testing you.  All kids are like that.  Some more than others.  My 8 yr old daughter would do the same thing until you put her in her place, then she's the best.  My girls are very active too, like they are always on the go, but it doesn't mean they're ADDHD.....just kids with a ton energy.  <br>  <br>  what's does it really matter if she wears what she wants?  She figure out real fast if she's cold or not.  Remember you pick the battles.  I think she just may want you to get down to her level and read with her or talk to her.  I don't think sending her to social services for wearing shorts & a vest or not eating because she isn't hungry is going to solve anything.  You shouldn't have any kids at your age to begin with....and kids are always hard to deal with when you are not a mother yourself.  You are only 21.  Of course you're not going to have all the answers, but that doesn't mean you have to give up.  <br>  Remember....you pick the battles with her.  Do you really want to fight about her weariong a vest & shorts which is no big deal!|`|T864ejaiaa	bust her azz, and when she tells you she's calling the police. tell her you'll do it for her and call them. there is nothing wrong with her. i raised a daughter who was adhd, she was full blown special ed. your niece is telling you SHE is the boss. if it was mine, i'd wear her az out so she wouldn't be able to sit.<br>  <br>  one more thing, if she acts up take her to the washrom and splash cold wATER IN HER FACE. (sorry caps got stuck). i did this with all 4 of mine and it worked.|`|0jIycwp8aa	yOUR CHILD IS RUINED FOREVER RUN FAR AWAY|`|b3c054cf8a809cd78b23404a2feecb7daa	There are tricks you can play on her. Like when she threatens to call the cops, take the phone off her and pretend to call them yourself and say "theres a very naughty girl here (and give address) if shes not going to be good in half an hour, can I call you again and get you to come pick her up?" That should do the trick, but you can't do this too often, or she might start to suspect. Or tell her a story about a woman who comes around collecting bold children and no one ever sees them again, and all you have to do is ring her and she'll come. I know these stories aren't fair on a 5 year old, but it may be your only hope. As you say, the child is not your own, she should not even be your responsibility, you're only 21 years old and chose not to have any children of your own, so why should you be burdened with one? You should look into different options.
YVBXMghXaa	If you sent in the registration card when you purchased the seat, they will notify you if the seat has been recalled.  Just to check, look up the model number of the seat (it should be on the sticker that has the date of manufacture on it) and google it.<br>  <br>  It sounds like you are not using a locking clip on the seat belt.  That is very important if you are installing using a seat belt.  (here is a random photobucket pic of what one looks like...its the little metal piece <a href="http://media.photobucket.com/image/locking%20clip/mkntenn/Health-Safety/02212009022.jpg?o=1" rel="nofollow">http://media.photobucket.com/image/locki...</a> )  Most seats have them attached to the base somewhere if you flip the seat over.  It should just unclip.  You attach that to the belt (on the side opposite the buckle).  The lap belt part loops slips in one side, the shoulder belt to the other.  Then climb in the seat and pull the belt as tight as you can.  No carseat should move more than one inch at the belt path (the top of the seat will often move more than that....its where the belt goes though that you are concerned about).<br>  Seats do expire in 5 years (generally....it does depend on the manufacturer), but if its an infant carrier, you should only need it for a few months anyway, so it is most likely fine until you need a convertible seat.  Check the date of manufacture, which should be printed on a sticker somewhere on the shell of the seat.  If its more than 5 year old, it is time for a new one.|`|BypjotRpaa	here is a website of  The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's<br>  Child Restraint Recall Campaign listing.. i hope it helps. it was updated on tuesday.|`|GGBDkOuFaa	Car seats expire after 5 years, so chances are the one you are using is expired.   Car seats should not move around a lot.|`|oA8Rtyxuaa	to put your mind at ease, fire stations do free car seat checks, you can take it there and they can make sure you have installed it correctly and tight enough. The infant carriers do move around and it is unsettling, I agree!|`|9ozDCTDTaa	A car seat should never move more than an 1 inch at most.  In order to get ours tight enough I had to put my knee into the carset base and put all my weight on it and then pull the strap tight (this is how the directions say to install it as well).  The first time we put the base in the car we took it to the fire station and they did it for us.  That way we would know that we had it in there tight enough.  It should never lean
AA11273571	Either way, Zahra Lillie or Lillie Zahra, sounds pretty.|`|cSkpQlaeaa	My names Arielle<br>  It means lioness of god.<br>  It means im powerfu,strong,openminded,Pure,And loving.<br>  I love it..<br>  And Arielle Lillie,Go's really nice i think :)<br>  There's not enough Arielle in the world.And its such a pretty name,not being vain btw.I just thin your baby,Well be pretty whatever name she has :)<br>  So good luck<br>  Btw Zahra Lillie I dno...I dont see it?<br>  Bye xoxoxoxo|`|s2F6pK9Xaa	I like it, but to get that pronunciation you may want to consider spelling it Zarah. Otherwise, I think she would get "Zahara" a lot. <br>  <br>  Very pretty though- I like it a lot with Lillie.|`|JU351q6Naa	Zahara is a much better name thena Zahra in my opinion. I love the name Zahara it is lovely.<br>  You could have:<br>  Zahara Lillie<br>  Lillie Zahara<br>  Zahra Lillie<br>  Lillie Zahar|`|sqaey2Siaa	I think it sounds okay, I would imphasis the aa on the end of Zahra though. Maybe a diffrent spelling.|`|qxnxm0YLaa	I LOVE the name Zara (without the 'h')! However I am not a big fan of Lillie. To be honest, the two names do flow well together, but I would consider using another 2-syllable middle name (unless Lillie is a dear family member's name that you really want to use).|`|Rhr1umV1aa	I think that maybe Zahara Lillie sounds better. Zahra sounds like ZA RAH like cheerleading or something. Cute idea, just maybe add another A. Hope this helps.|`|AA11271819	preettii cool, however Zahara Lillie suits too...|`|d46b27856ae8a0c999a27247aed26a73aa	To me the name itself, sounds like a question.  sorry.|`|VTkRjExmaa	yes,,,Zahra Lilie flow well,,,,<br>  <br>  such a pretty name...|`|3c51ba3982b4a0fa984f838020963690aa	I like how you spell Zahra, easy to know how to pronounce it, and it's a pretty name.<br>  <br>  I think Zahra Lillie is pretty and flows fine.
dR2bqUixaa	I like them! I like the spelling Neva.|`|hOw4Gncmaa	I prefer the Neeva spelling. Maybe NeeVa to enunciate the vah part? I like both names a lot. They are both very original.|`|RoVfm2JZaa	I like Neeva better then Neva, and Davius sounds a little old fashioned but I like it.|`|eJMIazhLaa	I'm not really a fan of Davius, but that's just me.  I like the spelling for Neva.|`|a1uoxczTaa	i really like Davius and I just don't care for Neva.|`|i0Exuxi2aa	Like them both.Nothing wrong with the spellings...|`|BdeMZvQSaa	i think Neva is good.|`|VQ2Lk4vWaa	I really like Davius, it sounds strong and it's different. Good name.<br>  I personally dont care much for Neva/Neeva. But if thats what you have your mind set on I'd spell it Neva.|`|Bg6txvxqaa	They're quite unusual names so nice!<br>  <br>  I'd go with Neva for a girl looks nicer than with the double e|`|BiMeb75Gaa	Davius is okay but I'm not crazy about it.<br>  Neva is really cool and the spelling is unique!|`|BRT2teSqaa	I hate both.  I would prefer Darius and Eva.|`|mBfvthNaaa	They are both ok, although I'm not crazy about either.  I would spell the girls Neva.|`|AA10826403	Im not a fan of Davius but Neva is cute.
WWcaKZ7Qaa	Not everyone has to do it, I did not. It could be something in your family's medical history or the child's father's family medical history that made them refer you.|`|fHgbL046aa	I live in Ontario Canada and we only see a genetic counselor if there is something wrong with the baby,or had complications with a first child or if your 35 and over. I had to see one at 16 weeks pregnant because my blood results were abnormal. I then waited 2 weeks to have a ultrasound and everything is okay so far. You should talk to your doctor and ask why you need to see one.|`|s1utniuvaa	I never saw one. She wanted me to because she thought I couldn't quit smoking on my own so she wanted me to go to a genetic counselor so they could tell me the all the things that could happen if I didn't quit. HA! I showed her. And I never went to go see that counselor.<br>  <br>  Edit - Was that thumbs down for quitting on my own after the dr had no faith I could or because I didn't need to waste my time seeing the counselor because I was quitting so I didn't need to see the effects of smoking during pregnancy? Jerk.|`|ejQ3yg9Naa	I didn't have to. Does your family have a history of genetic disease?|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	nope never have prego 2times <br>  some dr might think it is a good idea if you ahve a family history of something( lol we ALL do )|`|ApyrV5J9aa	Typically not all women meet with genetic counselor unless your obgyn is given reason to believe there is a possibility for genetic problems. That would be the case if you have a particular family history or if you had abnormal lab work. What blood tests has the doctor ran and do you have a history of genetic disorders in your family or the father's? If so, that's why you are being directed there. There are also some doctors that insist on having all of their patients have such a meeting, although it is rare and many insurances will not cover that counseling unless there is a reason for it. Also, remember that just because you are visiting a genetic counselor doesn't mean your baby will have a problem, they just discuss your chances and your options. Best of luck to you.|`|d5fd9d057a20f9f41b37d39a5288a98faa	I am 14 weeks and my DR has said nothing about seeing a specialist/genetic counselor, are you over 30? Sometimes they do this if genetic abnormalities run in your family or if they want to make sure your baby doesn't have one. I am sorry I am not much help. GL and I wish you the best!|`|9cpwsrJiaa	I'm 8 months pregnant and I've never even heard of a genetic counselor.... I'm sure there is a good reason they sent your to them though.|`|wKuQC4yTaa	no, i never saw one. and no one I know has|`|8RfmosODaa	No, not everyone has to. Are you maybe a little older? Sometimes older mommys have to. Congrats on the baby!
PpYBnxgpaa	YES . I work full time and I am a damn good mother . I am due for #2 in October and I as well will be taking 3 months off with my kids . I did that with my son to . In this day and age I believe to survive BOTH parents need to work . although was also a single mommy till about 6 months ago so I had to .But I wouldn't change a thing <br>  <br>  Also you said you could work from home? Why not do that part time ?|`|lFlapW8maa	if you know you are not the type of person that can not stay home then dont.  you can be an effective mom working full time.  it just requires a little more work.  <br>  <br>  and no your child will not become more attached to the nanny unless you never see your child. <br>  <br>  you need to be happy so your family can be happy.  take care yourself first before you can take care of others.|`|1mL4Lxtnaa	My Mom has worked since shortly after I was born. She's a single Mom, and still works hard everday although Im old enough that I don't need someone to watch me all the time. Right down to it - she has been an awesome Mom since the beginning. I think it's very possible, especially if you have such a good job and one that offers such flexibility.|`|CwNMq7RTaa	Look at it this way.  Would you get hired for a job and then not show up?  No?  Then why would you consider not showing up for your job of mother?  Why is it all about you?  The entire future emotional foundation of a life is laid in the first three years.  Why should it be about you?  You can have a lower standard of living for a few years.  It won't kill you.  And the baby won't know the difference.|`|856503b3f4fc0e94b055e5fbebd79accaa	What kind of question is that?  There are hundreds of thousands (including myself) of working mom's.  This isn'tt the fifties where women weren't expected to work.  Of course you can be a wonderful mother and still do your job.  Doubting this will only lead to further issues for you and your child.|`|jCeylLsIaa	yes, i think so...just don't bring home work...|`|MfDRFP7faa	sure<br>  thats wut wut my mom has done her whole life<br>  and shes done most things right wit me<br>  8]<br>  <br>  u can do it! if u put ur mind to it|`|xZKqEp06aa	you will and you can try|`|AA11458954	My grandma had seven kids and had to work because her husband was ill. All of my dad's siblings said they felt loved and that is was a good role model for them to see grandma working so hard. But at the same time do you really want a stranger to raise your child? If your job allows you to work from home then I would say do that. There is nothing greater then being a SAHM. The first 5 years are the formative years this is when you need to be with your kids the most. This isn't to say working mom's aren't good moms. But if you can afford to do it I think its the better choice for the children.|`|AA12227599	Well first I want to say that this would have been a much better question "before" you got pregnant, but it's too late for that.<br>  I would say that when they are tiny babies like that they need their mother for the first year anyway. I realize it's not always do-able, but it is pretty important. Is the child going to be with daddy or a family member? Because that is the only way i would say to consider it. Never leave your baby with a stranger until they can at least talk and tell you if anything is wrong. If you have an option to work at home, I would jump at it as fast as you can. Unless of course daddy can be with her while you are at work. Trust me, I have 4 children and you will miss alot, especially the first year and you will always wish you hadn't. You may have to cut back on some of your expenses, but that is what having children is all about, sacrifice!! Good luck, and I hope everything works out for you all. Congratulations on the baby girl. (and let me just add that girls are WAY tougher than boys to raise, I have 2 of each. YIKES!!!) So be prepared.|`|aGxbD6snaa	yes you can, having a job is for a reason so you can provide for your family and give your daughter what she needs, theres nothing wrong with that. you are able to spend the first few months with her which is good. im personally a stay at home mum to my 7 week old daughter while her dad works and i love it, i couldnt imagine leaving her to go to work every day but everyone lives their life differently. its your life and how you want to live it is up to you. as long as you spend time with her and do what mothers should do then you are being the best mum you can. besides you will be greatful for the break, as i would appreciate a regular break but its all part of the package. do what feels right to you. also youre best waiting until your baby is here to decide properly as after the birth everything changes. good luck.|`|xcJwxyRRaa	Yes, without a doubt.<br>  My mother raised 3 boys (not to mention all aunts and uncles and everyone else I've known with kids who worked full time--it's life, reality--unless you're Rich! haha) and both my parents worked full time and I'm sure your child will never get more attached to the nanny/sitter/others than you...she is literally part of you , your DNA, and things you're prob not aware of..<br>  but it might be a good idea to do research on parenting.<br>  I know nothing about the subject from experience, but I'm sure there are numerous books, PARENT Magazine I've seen in the stores, and offices, etc..magazines and specific websites for parents, etc, not to mention shows on TV prob everyday that deal with parenting issues.<br>  You can never get too much info on parenting I'd guess.<br>  good luck and congrads..|`|BrVlBMOSaa	Ofcourse you can. I am a mom of two and work full time. you will need the rest in the beginning. but after 3 months of sahm...you will be ready to return to work.|`|kBCfzrqhaa	Yes I think you can. It depends on person to person. If you can pull out then I think you should. My mom was working mom. Yeah for sure we used to miss her and wanted to spend more time. But then we wouldnot get all the luxury things...<br>  But I think your daugther will be more independent. Also I suggest if you will go back then you have to make sure that when you actually spend time with your daugther it is a quality time. But you have to be extra strong. Also in your case ecconomy is bad so you have to make a balanced decesion. Not too practical nor too emotional. Also if your job is very flexible then why do you worry that much. I think you are lucky in that way. You shouldnot give up your job that easily. You and your husband has to give time to baby togther..<br>  Be strong everything will work it out...<br>  let us know how it is going|`|eu6UQElYaa	The short answer is yes, you can be a good mom and work full time.|`|g2QUNwZzaa	my mom works full time. and she's a good mom<br>  <br>  although, im hardly a newborn. we dont need a tenth of the attention and care someone younger needs. me and my brother are both over 20. we're at the age where we could possibly live alone and are capable of caring for ourselves.and wont drink the stuff under the sink when she's not home
d6df9c3bab13d4a609d4641b785de6b0aa	You have to have an order from a Dr for a blood test. I didn't need an appointment to get a blood test done at my Dr's office though. The nurse just drew my blood. You could ask your Dr for the order and either go to the hospital lab to have it done or ask your Dr's nurse to draw it for you. I worked at a Dr's office for 6 years and that is how we did it most of the time.|`|cnIzqEoDaa	The hospital is probably the only other place besides your doctors office. Most places don't have a lab to analyze the test, so they only use urine tests. Good luck!|`|0rd67qEMaa	they rarley do those anymore... its best you go to a vaginal doctor and get her to examin you
rpsXPdFmaa	A quarter for every dish washed?  A few dollars for helping take in groceries and putting them up?  A dollar for taking out the trash?  All I can think of at the moment.|`|T864ejaiaa	take his favorite toy away. make him clean his room and help with the dishes.|`|45nSn7Rcaa	Eight yrs old is not a baby...people are getting way too soft on thier children with each passing generation.  There are plenty of things he can do in the house.  My mother was younger than that in the 30's and was practically raising her younger siblings right along with her mother, she was cooking, cleaning, baking, doing laundry, changing diapers etc etc....and those things were a lot harder back then.  So, what Im saying is...get him doing dishes, folding and putting away laundry, cleaning bathrooms, vacuuming, dusting etc etc. <br>  I like that you chose to do it this way because your reasoning abou the money makes a lot of sense since he gets so much.  Good for you.|`|wiAVa1H5aa	He should pay you back, he can sell his stuff if he has too.   Winter?   At 8 years old he can shovel the walk, salt it every day, take out the garbage, take out the compost, the recycling, he can clean the ash out of the stove, he could pick snow out of the dog's paws and groom the dog, he can clean the cat box, clean the bathrooms, vacuum the house, do the dishes, set the table, clean the kitchen cabinets, change the sheets on the beds, wash the mirrors and inside the windows, he can polish the silver, he can take the books of the shelf and dust each one with a damp cloth.....   Jeez, he's 8, he can do a lot of things right now even with winter.|`|ozqYakRpaa	When I was about 8 I broke the towel rack in the powder room. My father is sort of a mister-fix it kinda guy but was never real big on extreme punihshment. He simply picked a day when it was real nice out and he made me sit there in the bathroom and watch him while he fixed it. That was punishment enough and I saw that my actions translated directly into him having to waste his time.|`|85vDqn6naa	Well first of all if he broke something of his own let the lesson be that if you flip out and break your things then that is one less toy or something for you to play with on the other hand if he broke something of yours make him give you one of his most prized possessions so he can get the feeling of what it is like to lose something. You could make him vacuum or scoop the cat box or anything really that would be a chore for you. Good luck!|`|FsmcCXlvaa	Some ideas; cleaning up his room, making his bed, putting away toys, help fold laundry, unload dishwasher, sweep kitchen floor, clean windows, vaccum... He's 8 and there are a lot of household chores that he's capable of doing. Show him how it's done and go from there. It may not be done perfectly but at least he's contributing and learning to help out, not to mention re-paying a debt for damage.|`|DDFSITiYaa	I don't know so much about piece labor - that will be hard to keep track of.  How about a rate of $ per hour of labor?  Set it to an easy amount to calculate and he can figure it out as he works.    All the chores everyone has posted will work or whatever needs done at the moment in your house.|`|sVdQSMvJaa	wait a minute you're punishing him for being destructive by PAYING him to do chores?  What you'll teach him is that being destructive will result in money.  Isn't that rather counterproductive?|`|AA11537580	landry<br>  sweeping the floor<br>  mopping the floor<br>  dishes<br>  dusting<br>  cleaning toilet<br>  cleaning the tub|`|a1uoxczTaa	make him wash dishes, clean stuff up, sweep, vaccum, make beds, dust, make him write a million times hes sorry for what hes done...|`|KSUPtqCaaa	You've given yourself the answer here. You have normal housework that needs to be done, and he can do much of it. Granted, you may have to guide him, or even outright help with some tasks; but ultimately, you have found a very good means of discipline.<br>  <br>  Personally, I'm fond of the idea of cleaning of the bathroom and kitchen (but be careful with the chemicals involved - teach him how to use them safely; not to mix bleach and ammonia, etc). You can have him vacuum, mop, scrub, and polish. A good task might be to use a very mild bleach solution and a toothbrush to scrub mildew out of tiles; or use toothpaste to polish the faucets and stainless-steel rim around sinks (you actually can, and it shines nicely).<br>  <br>  These are good endurance tasks, and will leave him a little sore from the work. As for 'wages' for his time worked, divide his age by minimum wage per hour, and then put that money into a jar to be used to purchase replacement items for those items broken.<br>  <br>  Again, this is a great idea and I think it will be very effective.<br>  <br>  Cheers!|`|iCexBHclaa	cleaning up his room, making his bed, putting away toys, help fold laundry, unload dishwasher, sweep kitchen floor, clean windows, vaccum...

Also, have him donate some of his stuff to charity.|`|91jTS7Epaa	I recommend having him do chores for others... shoveling their driveways and sidewalks, doing any of the chores listed here, but having to ask to help others and ask that they pay him so that he can earn enough to pay for what he broke.  It will help others while teaching him how much he has.  He can start out with grandparents, aunts, uncles, neighbors, etc.  But having to explain why he did what he did, and why he is requesting work from them is key.  Whether or not you actually take the money from everyone is your own decision, as it could be seen as greedy if you have the money and are making your child work to pay back something when you can afford to repair/replace it yourself.  Maybe have him keep track of how much he earned from each person, and then go back and secretly repay them...|`|AA12005445	At 8 yrs old he should be helping you around the house anyway. Firstly  I would put a time limit on when the damage needs to be paid by,  This is important because it will help to make him understand the seriousness of not respecting what belongs to other people.  Then make him pay so much from his own money and put a price on the different household chores he does for you.<br>  Whenever my daughters had their cousins to sleep everyone mucked in and helped and I wouldnt dream of paying them. I did the bulk of the housework and they did the chores they were happy with. Boys didint seem to mind making beds or washing up ect. they peeled the potatoes and helped me do the veg and cooking.  They even went to the local shops for me. This should start on a small scale soon as they learn to walk so that by the time they are  8yrs old they are confident in doing lots of things.|`|hKJIDdVqaa	why should it be something in the house? Make him go out and shovel the whole yard.Surely the snow and cold will not kill him.  It is 15 below zero with windchill where we live, my children often go out to play for an hour.  Just keep him dry and warm. It will add character and blow off some of that 8 yr old steam he has.  Further more tell him when he feels the need to throw his next tantrum to please do it outside.|`|G2auAv1Saa	washing dishes, vacuuming, folding laundry, sweeping, scrubbing toilets, taking out the trash- anything around the house- he's 8 he's capable with some direction.

diT2WFfCaa	Well, I'd suggest taking another one now that you've missed your period.  Most tests don't say they are 99% accurate until the day after your missed period.<br>  <br>  If you don't want to take another home test, see your doctor, and ask for a QUANTITATIVE blood test.  This will tell you exactly what the hCG levels are, whereas the home ones, and qualitative blood tests, only give a positive result if the levels are at a certain point, which yours might not be.|`|8e373a7bc6b3c784f2bae9cc02a6cf20aa	You are only a day late.  Relax.  If you don't have it in a week from now, take another test, or see your doctor!|`|GUZrSDvdaa	take it easy octomom|`|BgouZaeSaa	Hi first you have to relax.When you are nervous and thinking all the times your period won't come..You have to calm and don't think it.If you take the test always will show you negative because its too early to see if you are pregnant.My advice is to calm.Once i have one week late and i wasn't pregnant.You know why?Because i was thinking it.Sometimes if you are sick or you are tired your period is late.I hope i help you.|`|mFQydvncaa	take one today! a day can make the difference! goodluck!|`|xCfHnQBbaa	One day late does not mean you are pregnant!

Also, you stressing about the possibility of being pregnant may in fact delay your period.|`|BhXwQ2n1aa	I wouldn't worry until you're at least 1-2 weeks late, especially since the test came up negative.|`|AA10212874	I would wait another few days--it's still early--stress could also cause a later period|`|8LBl7HgAaa	You should wait a week and try again.

vue9NOhYaa	"Plenty of sites?" Sure. There are lots of 'pro-life' sites on the itnernet ... most of which will lie/sway the truth in countless ways to support their beliefs.<br>  <br>  There are NO hospitals where newborns are being put out with the dirty laundry.|`|723QHuicaa	Ok what you are referring to is not technically full term, newborns.<br>  <br>  You are confused with late term abortions. The baby IS delivered and NO medical care is administered, hence the child of <24weeks gestation WILL pass away.<br>  <br>  In the UK drs are not permitted to give life saving treatment to a premature baby born before 24 weeks, so these babies are delivered and the mother holds them till they pass away|`|rjVALevtaa	This is illegal. Period. There's no need to pass a bill for this since it's already illegal! It's basically murder. I don't believe this. Post your links that support this.|`|SjX72fPyaa	I don't believe in abortion either but I find it really hard to believe that hospitals are doing this.<br>  And just a side note: your "source" took me to the featured videos page on youtube....nice dependable source there|`|UdtzY5ciaa	Sounds like nonsense propaganda.|`|N6cuuDAmaa	I think that abortion is VERY wrong... No one should ever do it! You're right... there always is adoption if someone doesn't want their baby... abortion is killing one of God's many miracles, just keep on protesting on what you believe in and maybe someday you could change the world... and yes I've heard that they do that with babies... and I was talking to my mom about it and she said that sometimes the nurses will feel bad and they will hold the babies until they die... and they can't take them home or they'll get fired... why is some of this world so sick!?|`|45q1vygzaa	What you're talking about is already illegal.   No bill is needed to stop it.  If it is happening anywhere--which it's not--it's a problem of enforcement, not legislation.|`|xLSb3XgCaa	thats wrong, they need to think about the parents that want babies but cant have them <br>  i dont believe in abotipon at any age you would be killing and inisit baby for somthing you did wrong|`|jN3pRKkEaa	Then show your sources.  What sites did you get your research from?|`|1SGl03Zlaa	This is already illegal.  As soon as the baby is fully out of the mothers body it is no longer considered abortion and would then be considered murder.  This would not be a late term abortion.  <br>  A late term abortion is when the doctor delivers everything but the head of the baby and then injures its head killing it while still inside the mother before delivering what is left.  Even these types of abortions are illegal in most places.  <br>  I can't understand how any hospital could be getting away with doing this.  The only reason I could see is if the baby is being born early enough that it has a 0% chance of survival, but I don't think they should be allowed to induce a woman that early in the first place.<br>  As for why Obama wouldn't pass a bill to prevent this, he is pro-choice and supports abortions.|`|6VbNJOtfaa	Let's think about this for a minute...<br>  <br>  If you are a mother then you have felt the love you have for your child.  There is no other love like it- you would stab your neighbor in the face 50 times if he touched your precious baby- RIGHT?<br>  <br>  So, the type of person that would have a late term abortion is probably the scariest person alive.  If they are so emotionless that they would hold their tiny baby (as a previous post noted) until it stopped breathing and then go on with their lives, they would stab their neighbor in a heartbeat.<br>  <br>  My point- once you have done the unthinkable and KILLED your own child, you are bound to do anything.  You cannot have any self respect left, and you cannot tell me that you like the person you see in the mirror.  You are right up there with child molesters and rapists, and you are damn lucky that God is forgiving- repent before it's too late!<br>  <br>  But, that's just my opinion; everyone has one.|`|8XcRFF6Taa	I remember hearing about this.  It's when women are having late term abortions but if for some reason the baby survives botched abortion the DR isn't obligated to call a pediatrician for the baby.... it's just left there with out treatment...to die.  Obama didn't pass it because and I quote "doesn't want to burden the mother with her original decision".  It's sick, so sick.  I personally am pro choice but I only believe it should be done the first few weeks, 10-12 at the most.  Which is what most abortion clinics do.  Late term abortions are so disgusting, there is no reason a women should wait that long to have an abortion!   I believe it's allowed up to 22weeks.  Baby's are able to survive as early as 24 weeks.  Late term abortion should not be allowed!!!!<br>  <br>  It doesn't make any since to me why a women having a late term abortion wouldn't just wait and give it up for adoption.  For late term abortions they induce you so go into labor and have to deal with all the same pain, just the end result isn' a healthy baby.......|`|ssrYd8Msaa	First off, you are so totally wrong about the issue that  President Obama voted against 3-4 years ago while he was still a senator.  <br>  <br>  The bill was raised to ban partial birth abortions.  Obama voted against passing the bill because the current one didn't have any medical prevention or after treatment for the woman involved.  Several other members of congress also voted against the bill because it was so incomplete.  <br>  <br>  Later the bill was revised to include the medical treatment and passed in congress.  Obama has always been against partial birth abortions because they are so inhumane.<br>  <br>  Get your facts right before posting next time.
XhIYAH6Laa	First Response is one that says you can test up to 5 days before your missed period. Sometimes it works that far in advance sometimes not until after you actually miss your period, it all depend how much of the hcg hormone is in your body at the time of testing. Mine didn't work until the day I missed my period, don't waste your money doing it early as it may not be accurate.|`|2jrffIoWaa	First Response claims to be able to...there's a coupon on their website!  - <a href="http://www.firstresponse.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.firstresponse.com/</a><br>  <br>  Also, It might be a good idea to wait just a bit, because it's not 100% accurate that soon, even if it claims to be.  Seeing a neg. result is really sad...so if you want to increase your chances of seeing a double line maybe wait a couple days!<br>  <br>  Good luck!!!!|`|d5fd9d057a20f9f41b37d39a5288a98faa	I used EPT hpt, and it was 2 days before my period was due and I got a faint positive.

The positive line was actually much darker than the control lines.<br>  <br>  I think it depends a lot more on you and your hCG levels than the brand of test. You're supposed to test in the morning so your urine isn't as diluted, but I took mine right before bed and after a lot of water and it obviously worked for me.|`|YcwMK5Pbaa	I used First Response as well, 2 days before Period was due, and it told me "yes"  (digital ones rock!!)|`|0UAIBW53aa	first response worked for me i tested 5 days early and it showed a positive result|`|CP27Tnyvaa	I've heard EPT was the best.|`|Fh4B88ZGaa	First response- but you're really better off waiting until your period is due.

I worked in day care and mothers are notorious for taking their sick kids around other kids. Whether he loves getting together with the other babies or not, I would keep him away, his health is more important.  And by the way, anti-bacterial wipes will do nothing to prevent a virus. Anti-bacterials only kill bacteria.  Lysol will kill anything.  If you can't find Lysol wipes, (look on the label to see if it will kill viruses as well as bacteria), then just get some baby wipes or paper towels and soak them in the Lysol, and pack them in a plastic bag to keep in your diaper bag.
diT2WFfCaa	It depends on how long you think you've been pregnant for.  Chance are, though, the fact that you're getting bigger has nothing to do with being pregnant.  If the test came back negative, you definitely aren't far enough along to be showing, even a tiny bit.<br>  <br>  The first noticeable signs are sore or tender breasts and nipples, tiredness, and then your missed period.

You are going to have to put your foot down. When she breaks a rule make her face the music and follow through with the consequences. She will test you until you are ready to scream like a toddler.<br>  <br>  And like a toddler your child is seeking attention, no matter how she gets it good or bad.<br>  <br>  For the door slamming, tell her if she slams one more door, you will remove the door to her bedroom, then follow through.<br>  <br>  For cussing, put clear hot sauce on her tooth brush, when she brushes her teeth she will get the effect of it. Once she has, tell her that if she wants to use "hot" words, she can have a hot mouth to go with it. <br>  <br>  For being snarky take away something that she really likes to do, for instance if she loves video games take the controllers so that she can't play. Leave the game deck and games where she can see them.<br>  <br>  If it's the computer, take away the mouse..etc<br>  <br>  One thing I learned was that if I took something away like the video game if I removed it from the room once it was out of site it was also out of mind. Leaving it in the room, but making it unplayable keeps it at the forefront of the mind. <br>  <br>  Sometimes you will just have to "pull the rug from off in under them and let them fall on their faces" in order to get your point across.<br>  <br>  I also learned that I AM NOT my child's friend. I am her mother and as such it is my responsibility to teach her how to act like a human being.<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK and if you need a shoulder to lean on just email me. I know what you are going through!|`|1enIWBGnaa	Sounds like something has changed..... when did you allow the change to happen?  YOU are the one who has lost the control - YOU need to regain your 'parental' control NOW!!!<br>  Give her a ton of chores to do or she looses ALL privileges!  Every time she misbehaves - take away more privileges.  Once she's down to only blankets on the floor (for sleeping) and no furniture - then perhaps she will 'get it' and change.  Children love to 'push the limits', to see just how much they are allowed to get away with; once a parent sees this, puts their foot down, regains 'who the boss is' then the child will give up and back down.<br>  Another concept; sit down and have a long conversation with her.  It is your job to find out why she's behaving badly.  Perhaps it has something to do with 'puberty'.  Her body is changing and she's scared.  You need to help her through this NOW.<br>  I have 3 grand daughters, going through this and without 'parental' conversations and advise - they'd be completely messed up.   Their parents had the 'smarts' to notice changes, sit down with them to discuss things, answer questions and help them.  I've done the same with them and we are closer for it.|`|FhEUCrttaa	I would say that there is something else going on. Try to see what has happened. Has there been any changes in her life? Even if it not a big change to you it may be to her.|`|kyUiaDgyaa	I believe someone needs to have an "Attitude Adjustment" don't you think?|`|VXCfGX4caa	There may be a few explanations;<br>  <br>  1. Early puberty has started<br>  You need to be extra sensitive during this time, but gradually allow her to be more independent<br>  <br>  2. You<br>  There is a REASON why she is behaving like this. If it is not reason 1, then you must realise the cause of her behaviour. There will be a reason, eg neglect from you, boredom (can be a result of the latter), bullying, diet (remove junk from the house - she will starve for a few days - don't give in - then she'll eat the healthy stuff), excess tv (don't remove it, just provide alternatives you know she'll like). There is of course more, but try these anyway...<br>  Hope I helped<br>  <br>  Bless<br>  <br>  RE: Imperfection at it's finest<br>  <br>  Things like putting hot sauce on the toothbrush are sneaky; she will not respond favourably (two wrongs DO NOT make a right). Most likely result will be that she stops brushing her teeth.|`|MUVdG9n1aa	Discipline is very important here... kids get to the point where they are testing your boundaries. Be firm and make punishments fit the behavior. She has to learn to be respectful. Try taking away privileges (going to friends' houses, watching tv) and do NOT back down. My dad was very lax with me as a kid and I walked all over him. You need to let her know you will not stand for this behavior. She will respect you later for it and thank you. Even if she acts like she hates you now :) Ask her how she would like to be spoken to and have her give you examples. Then tell her she can't expect you to be kind if she is not. G/L!|`|n35gWqEzaa	you need to do some active listening.  here is an example:<br>  <br>  her: I want to play outside!<br>  <br>  you: So you feel that I am being unfair?<br>  <br>  Her:...yes<br>  <br>  you: (then here you ex plane the reason she cannot do things)<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  i strongly suggest you google active listening.|`|IrquK9N6aa	1. Enough is enough <br>  <br>  First you have to make a decision that is enough is enough, and what you will and will not accept in the house. Many parents fear being strong as they think their teen will shout and be difficult; they just don't want the conflict. If you want the behaviour and attitude to stop, then you have to step up and be prepared to do what you must. Make a list now of the things that you want to stop. <br>  <br>  <br>  2. Set very clear boundaries <br>  <br>  When you have figured out what you want to change then get very clear what your boundaries are around these things. Now these are not a list of rules, they are a list of the furthest limits that you are prepared to go to. A list of your absolute cut-off points, so to speak, a list of what is and is not acceptable to you -- the bottom line. Some of these may be negotiable, e.g. curfew times and some may not be, e.g. sharing in the housework. Go back to the list and deicide which are negotiable and which are non-negotiable. <br>  <br>  <br>  3. Have a conversation <br>  <br>  Once you have got clear, have a conversation with your teenager if at all possible. Tell them that you are not happy with their behaviour/attitude of late and that you want to talk about this and set some guidelines up so everyone is happy. If they want to talk, great; if they will not then let them know that you will be setting the boundaries with or without them, however you would like their input. In this conversation you will let them know the non-negotiable boundaries (try and get no more than five here), and you will be discussing the negotiable boundaries and the consequences of breaking them. (More on this next week). <br>  <br>  <br>  4. Deal with the non-negotiable boundaries swift and quickly <br>  <br>  Most parents fail in improving behaviour and attitude because they fail to step in quick enough when something happens that they are unhappy with. It is a bit like the frog situation -- if you put a frog in a pan of boiling water it will jump out, however if you put it in a pan of cold water and heat it up gradually the frog will cook to death. By putting up with small things everyday you are doing what the frog is doing -- tolerating something that could potentially be damaging. The place I see this most is in how parents allow their teenager to talk to them on an everyday bases. If we allow swearing, talking to us with no respect, etc., then our teenager will think that this is the acceptable. So when one of your non-negotiable boundaries is stepped over, here is what to do. <br>  <br>  Let your teenager know what they are doing <br>  <br>  Let them know it is unacceptable <br>  <br>  Ask them to stop <br>  <br>  Tell them what will happen if they continue <br>  <br>  Listen to the audio to see how this works in practice. <br>  <br>  <br>  5. Keep consistent <br>  <br>  Once you are started with the four-step approach above you need to make sure that you are consistent. If you allow something one day and not the next, then whatever you do will have no impact. You need to apply this every time your child steps over a non-negotiable boundary. <br>  <br>  <br>  6. Keep your emotions in check <br>  <br>  Most households are run on emotions, both the parents and the teenagers; if you react to your teenager from emotion only, then it will be very difficult to deal with the hard and fast rules of the situation. When you are responded to a badly behaved teenager it is best to respond from a factual place, leaving the emotions as something that you deal with away from your teenager. Dealing with the facts allows you to stay calm and consistent, even in the most trying situations.|`|7oF2o4q5aa	DUCK!  Here comes puberty!  I know she is only 10 but it starts earlier every generation.  You have to set specific boundaries (no physical violence or cussing and speaking in a respectful way)  and then enforce them with whatever means works (removing privileges, taking away toys or computer or TV time, etc.).  YOU HAVE TO BE CONSISTENT!!!!!  The same way, every time, all the time without exception. Nip it in the bud.  When she gets nasty, look her in the eye, tell her STOP! and give her the look (you know the one I mean) then give her a cooling off period.  People (no matter who) will only walk all over you if YOU let them!  In the meantime, make sure that nothing else is going on: problems in school (being bullied, having problems, teacher, etc.), problems with other people outside of school, moving, divorce, etc.  A sudden change like this could be the stress caused by any of the situations.  Talk to her when she is calmer.  Tell her what you see.  Maybe she doesn't know why she is acting this way either.  Sometimes a girl just needs her mama, ya know?  Remember that you too were young once.  Let her know that no matter what you are there to help her.  Try not to blur the line between being a friend and being her mother.  You NEED to be the mother.
Dxxz5s7Vaa	Yes you can.  Birth control is not 100% effective.  Reasons for pregnancy while on birth control can be for<br>  <br>  1.  Missing pills and not using a back up <br>  2.  Taking other medication can cause BC to be less effective.  Usually if you take it with antibiotics.<br>  3.  Not taking the pill around the same time everyday.<br>  4.  Only being on BC for a few days or weeks.|`|KHZLPldraa	Omg.  Nothing except abstinence is 100% effective.  Seriously.|`|ROJans2Taa	the pill is around 97.4% - 99.8% effective I believe so your chances would we something close to 1 in 100, some do better on the pill then others|`|O97ZoHGXaa	the pill actually has a high rate when it comes to protection. i believe it is 99.9%. this is providing you take it properly. make sure you read the leaflet it comes with very well.|`|MCTyWCu2aa	Well im 17 i was on birth control for 2 years and i now have a 5 month old :)|`|wKuQC4yTaa	birth control is never 100%|`|ptwnCWloaa	Absolutely!  Your doctor should have gone over this with you if you didn't already know it.

They will give you an exam and test your blood to see if you are still pregnant or have miscarried.  If you have miscarried you should have seen a bit more blood then that.  Go get checked out and I would agree with the other person that said to stay away from your ex.

vCq3dR40aa	Two parts to this answer.  As you approach 6 weeks your baby is likely to get more fussy and sleep less for a while.  It is a developmental thing and will decrease after 6 weeks.<br>  <br>  I read a couple of books on this.  You can adjust your baby's sleeping schedule, but you need to remember a couple of rules.  Baby needs to sleep 15-18 or more hours a day.  He should never be expected to be awake more than 2 hours at a time. (Frequently 1 hour or less)  It is much more difficult for baby to fall asleep once he is over tired.  I recommend waking him up periodically during the day to maintain a schedule with at least 3-4 day time naps.  My baby needed 5 because she never slept more than 45 minutes.<br>  Sleeping for up to 3 hours or a little more at a time during the day should be considered acceptable.<br>  "Healthy Sleep Habits Happy Child" explains all this, but don't fall into the trap of ensuring all naps are in babies bed.  You will be stuck at home for the next several years, and, when you do venture out, you will cause your baby maximum disruption.  My friend really liked "Happiest Baby on the Block".  Both these books can be found at most big book stores.|`|aauzpu3oaa	Hi - dont panic, what you have to do is try and keep him awake during the day and only allow him to have maybe an hour in the morning and same again in the afternoon say around 3pm-4pm then amuse him and hopefully by your bedtime he will be really tired and will sleep then.  Also, if you try and take a nap or rest when he is sleeping that will also help you not be so tired.  Not meaning to pry but does he have a Dad that lives with you - if so get him to help out too as he is his Son too.   It wont happen overnight but over a couple of weeks you should succeed in getting him into a pattern.  Always remember he will have to fit in with your lifestyle not what he wants. Good Luck!!|`|oFiStmkGaa	You have to break the cycle and get your child into a fixed routine. Children love routine. I had two children, and in their very  few weeks we got them into a routine, they woke up about 7ish in the morning and had there first nap about 9ish already, second nap was through lunchtime and the last nap at about 3ish, at about 8pm we put them to bed properly and they slept through the night. Within a few short months my daughter dropped two naps and only had one afternoon nap, which we tried to get her to do as early in the afternoon as possible to get her to go to bed at 7ish for a full nights sleep. My son dropped all naps from early on, however he has a serious tendency to fall asleep in the car if we drive somewhere during the afternoons. If we let him have an afternoon nap he gets seriously moody and only goes to bed at about 9pm.<br>  <br>  I'm not an expert in child-care but you're gonna have to get your child into a routine, and that can mean having to wake them up within a half an hour to an hour after they fall asleep in order to make adjustments in their daily routine. You might even have to prevent the child from having a nap in order to get the child into the routine. You have to break the cycle your child is currently in if you want to get some sleep.<br>  <br>  My children sleep pretty well at night , however I'm used to getting up frequently to check on them. Also, I'm not sure what age it is best but you should try get them of the night bottle as they get older because they can get real demanding at night for bottles which also adds extra stress because of having to change even more nappies. And if they know there's a bottle they can easily get then some nights they happen to get real thirsty, enough to drive parents nuts.|`|vyfrNxeOaa	You can change the sleeping paterns, only 1 hour every day, try to keep him awake and extra hour every day and /or wake him up, i know it seems cruel, but don'tnt mean trow water at him, just gently wake him up, put him in his playgym or take him out ,avoid leting him sleep more than 1 hour during the day.it will take time but in 1 to 2 weks you should see results|`|764df061bf8ba9b64d5294164b48b5a5aa	i ahve a 5month old, they settle int oa pattern with time, try to keep them awake a bit more prior to your bed, my baby boy used to sleep for most of the day and wake for feeds and cuddles, but mostly slept from 12 midnight through to 7am, so was excellent, but we had tv on and noise during day, no point keeping everyhting deadly silent when he is sleeping or he wont sleep through any noise. ours sleeps through tv being on, or xbox so absolutely fantastic (sorry) just hope he doesnt change.<br>  are you breast feeding or bottle? bottle feeds i believe help at night and heavier (ours was breast fed for about 3 months though, so sorry, (do you have a partner or friend / family who can help with the night time part, so you can get sleep - guess u are looking after during day so can be hard)|`|190zeu55aa	why you tired if he sleeps all day go to bed at one thirty and sleep in haha|`|eC1dQVcgaa	Sorry Honey, you won't be able to, not yet he's too young! <br>  It takes time, hopefully try to aim for a proper routine from 3-4 months.<br>  Good Luck, sleep when your baby sleeps! =] xx|`|Z8Ui1ugLaa	Start a routine, keep the house during the day bright and energetic.  Vacuum, radio, tv.  Wake him up from naps, after an hour or hour and half of sleeping wake him up.  At night, keep the house dim, quiet, settle down, he will soon learn the difference between night and day.  Good Luck|`|Pi8KfmOxaa	at this age you cant do much once hes been fed its hard to keep him awake,later on you will be able to get a routine going . i always kept to feeding them between 3/4 hours during the day and if they wasnt awake id wake them for a feed.but at the moment you need to take a nap during the day|`|hhWDHmfyaa	You can do this and it is important to do so for both your sakes.  Always remember that if you are not taking care of you, you are not fully taking care of him.<br>  <br>  It's time to break the rule of never wake a sleeping baby.  Let him sleep during the day for up to 4 hour intervals at first, then 3 hour intervals, then 2 hour intervals before letting him fall back to sleep.  It is also critical at his age to keep him hydrated.  Be sure to nurse him or bottle feed him upon waking.  He is doing so much growing while he is sleeping that he needs the hydration.<br>  <br>  Today, let him sleep his 4 hours, but do wake him - gently - and nurse him and snuggle and love him to keep him up for a bit. Get him on a four hour interval schedule where you interrupt his sleep during the day and make sure you go no longer than six hours at night.  Next week, wake him up every three hours during the day with the same feed, snuggle and stimulate routine during the day.  Be sure when he wakes at night that you feed him and snuggle him back to sleep without stimulation.<br>  <br>  It should only take a few weeks and you should be able to eventually get through the night with only 2 or 3 interruptions, then only 1 or 2 interruptions.  My daughter did this with a 9:50pm start to her day when she was born.  Trust me, you will smile at this someday.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|ATyHswTTaa	every 4hours wake ur boy up for feed, and keep him awake for while b4 he goes back to sleep.. and as nears closer to night time, dont leave him sleep, give him a feed, a bath and this will get him known its bed time..<br>  <br>  if ur son is hungry all time, try a hungry baby feed also, as my son was always hungry and woke 4time during the night.. <br>  <br>  in another 2wks, give last feed around 11pm and swap the night feeds with warm sugar water and this will also have him stop waking him up during the night time, get proper nite sleep for urself.. <br>  <br>  also i started my son on small amount food at 7-8wks old, once he started this, he slept all night long and had good pattern during the day also.. wish u luck..|`|LcRKHa0Gaa	I guess that's just how baby's work, honey! <br>  He is much too young for you to change his sleeping hours.<br>  <br>  Maybe try a village hall where lot's of 'Mum's with babies' meet up. <br>  Its very common.<br>  Then you can talk with them and do whats best.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!<br>  <br>  P.S. GOOD LUCK!|`|6cwJi5kxaa	Hes not too young to change his sleeping pattern. During the day try and keep him up as much as you can when he is awake. That way his naps will be later and eventually it will even out. It will be tough at first but just keep trying. It will get easier.
iFDye9RMaa	(my babe was delivered 5 months ago)<br>  My belly button did that too!! It was terrible. What I did was put a hell of a lot of lotion in it and rubbed it around. It was gone in almost no time at all! It was like it was just dry skin or something, I guess from it being stretched out of soooo long and then being forced back into shape so quickly... Try the lotion thing, It worked for me... <br>  <br>  I also got some stretch marks, I like to call them battle scars. :) It was a rough pregnancy... anyways they are already fading.<br>  <br>  I didnt get the line, so i cant help you there.|`|DzPZ8EEkaa	Mine all faded away for the most part in time.  I didn't get stretch marks myself, but I do know that for most women they fade to a silvery white color.  Hmm, not sure when the little brown line went away.

Your baby is only 4 weeks, and your body just did a pretty unbelievable thing!  Those Hollywood moms that look like their old selves in a few weeks are not reality.<br>  <br>  It took 9 months to make your body as it is, give yourself at least that long to allow it to return to normal!|`|qStmw7qgaa	Things will go down and start to fade.

MUVdG9n1aa	My son has always behaved like this but he's gotten better in recent years. (He's 10) Your local school district may do an evaluation for you. Contact them to find out. Otherwise ask your pediatrician. There could be an underlying hearing issue or food allergy. Do you spend a lot of individualized time with him? My son behaves much better when he feels he is being to, not at, and when he has things explained on his level when he is frustrated. He also needs lots of hugs and encouragement when he does good things. Also it is important to try and make eye contact when speaking to him, get down where he is. My son has never been diagnosed formally with anything but I have ADD and he has very similar traits. Good luck|`|iRXraQWyaa	Perhaps your parental skills need updating???|`|FhEUCrttaa	Talk to you pediatrician and get a referral to a child physiologist.|`|TK03jZTuaa	Before you look at any behavior problems, you must take a look at yourself first. Now, I am not meaning this in a nasty way. Allow me to explain, please...<br>  <br>  The vast majority of behavior problems with children come as result of the parents not understanding HOW to react to situations in order to deal with issues correctly. When we have kids, they don't come with an instruction booklet so we are learning as we go. <br>  <br>  Now, some kids are easier to handle than others. It is the smart parent who reads books and asks for advice, like you are doing. I would definitely read some moer books on pre-schoolers to enable you to deal with these problems. But as they have been going on for a while I think it might be time to take it to the next level.<br>  <br>  I only know of one man who can definitely help with this problem. Link below. I wish you luck. All parents need a medal for their efforts .|`|1enIWBGnaa	Stop feeding him junk foods and sweets; give it some time and see if his behavior changes - if not, then get him to a doctor for testing.<br>  He also may just be looking for attention.................|`|hdFSt0xNaa	doctors would tell you, Just tell them all you've listed and they can run some tests.<br>  I hope he's just a stubborn little child for the now haha <br>  hope i've helped :D x
aac7c6d4d79683e9cae0fe6a541bbccdaa	WHat I would do is send a tape recorder with your child.  She can place it in her pocket (some are very small) or in her desk.  Atleast, that is what I woudl do if I were going to continue to send my child to be verbally and emotionally assaulted.<br>  <br>  I would, in writing, make a complaint to the teacher, guidance counselor, principal and school board.  Send these letters via certified mail so that you have proof they are received.  Let them know that you find it unacceptable, and that if it happens one more time you are going to take legal action.  <br>  <br>  Also, attend the next PTA meeting and make complaints there.  <br>  <br>  That said, what I would honestly suggest is that you change teachers or schools, or better yet homeschool (I do!).  Your daughter does not deserve this, and it is wrong for this teacher to do it.  IF she has been approached and continues, there is something wrong and I would not want my child in that environment.|`|4BBjhHAnaa	Have you yelled at the teacher directly?<br>  Demand your daughter be put in a different class, or transfer her to another school in your district.<br>  I cannot imagine any of my teachers when I was in grade school doing something like that.

Tell the teacher that you don't appreciate her calling you daughter names, and that only teaches the other kids that it's ok. If they refuse to do anything then send your daughter school with a tape recorder and when she says it again, take that to the principle and tell them either she gets introuble or you take it above the priciple and superintendants heads. Then they will do something to fix this little issue.|`|7znQVVFXaa	THAT IS OUTRAGEOUS! Threaten to sue the school if changes aren't made NOW. That is mental/emotional abuse. Also threaten to report this story to the local newspaper. Demand for the teacher to be fired or else for your daughter to be moved to another classroom (another teacher). You've complained once, and they did not even acknowledge the problem.That is sick!  Also, speak to the school's superintendent. Do not give in to any excuses they may make. Under NO circumstances is it "ok" to call a student names like this, regardless of the student's behavior.|`|kBVCZK0Haa	oh my goodness i would request a teacher change & take it to the school board !!! I live in Texas and that would not fly here at all! my daughter is not in school yet but if a teacher ever called my child a name at all i would throw a fit. teachers are supposed to boost children s self esteem not make them feel bad about them selves if no one will help you don't give up till she resigns! if she wants to pick on your daughter pick back!|`|O4M6BEDJaa	If the people at the school aren't helping you I would take it up with the superintendent and see if you can get any where with them tell them if your daughter doesn't get to which classrooms your going to move her to another school they usually don't want that so it might help. And if not then I would move her I know it will be hard but it will be better for her in the long run.

ghz5D5iLaa	I would give it a shot. You don't want to be one that wakes up 15 years from now wondering what might have been. When some people do that they are bitter and resentful over lost opportunities. Could you be happy if you just let it go? You make things work for you and your family when you have children and a job. A lot of us do it and it can be done.|`|537fb036f0d7f523891b1281ae7d57d1aa	Look at finances in a way besides just money, and luxury items.  By doing this, you might have less stress about money, which can be a huge stresser on a marriage.  A stronger marriage, makes for a happier family, happy children.  <br>  <br>  Also, I guess Id need to know more on "miss a lot"  Would you just be gone a weeke or two?  That's hard, but I dont think it the grand scheme of things, really an issue.|`|AA11612508	i say try to take them with you as much as you possible can to eliminate the feeling of that you are leaving your family. I also think that music is crucial to kids. they dont get it in school at all anymore. I was brought up with music and i tell my husband constantly (we both dont play any instruments) that i hate that we cannot give that to our children.<br>  <br>  What works for your family will work out. I say just do it and go with the flow. do it now before school starts and you are on a major schedule.
mFQydvncaa	ok one, if you want the child have it, where is the father??? get a job now and save money! get on public assistance, medicaid wic? some places have public housing! you actually have to look into these things, you have a baby in there time to be responsible. You sound like you dont have a good relationship with your family anyway, consider the goodthings of having a child.<br>  <br>  if you cant afford it, give your baby to someone who can. Adoption. Also if the babys daddy bailed get him for child support its NOT impossible! i was 17 when i had my son! way to young but i did it! i worked my *** off and finished school! hes now 7 and i am happily married and his sperm donor is paying child support but isnt apart of his life! we are just fine! <br>  <br>  there are no excuses except the ones we make for ourselves!<br>  <br>  goodluck!|`|yKgABCxUaa	Adoption is an possibility!  You wouldn't have to have an abortion, and your family would never have to know....<br>  <br>  Ultimately its your decision though|`|NOPyPn9Uaa	well i have had one i was 20 years old and the guy i was with yeah total loser..what about adoption? there are ALOT of parents who would be willing to even pay you for your child..i do not know how far along you are but if you are going to abort you need to before its too late..i did the first 2 weeks..i mean it is horrible it is the last thing on earth i ever wanted to do...|`|iMY2fgYdaa	first of please keep your baby to full term...then adopt them out. There are tons of agencies out there that can help you pick a family of your choosing to adopt your little one out to. Medicade will pay for all your prenatal and delivery cost so you don't have to worry. If you can't find an agency find a local crisis pregnancy center and they will help you find the right contacts and help with getting maternity cloths and all that good suff...and if you keep your baby they will help you get the things you need to take care of the baby...you can do it honey just hang in there!!!|`|otFCWMuUaa	how about a adoption??|`|4XfjUcvDaa	First of all...do not let others influence what you want to do.<br>  <br>  If you feel that you can not care for this child and do not want to keep it, then make the decision to give it up for adoption.  It is not the child's fault that you are pregnant so why would you want to kill it.|`|H0fXySX9aa	you don't want a baby because its mixed race that is what i gather from your question<br>  i would do what i wanted to do which would be keep the baby its your choice your baby<br>  <br>  OK you have no money i was 17 on my own worked and was at college my mum gave me a hard time and did not want me to have a baby but i managed all your baby needs is you to bring him her up don't let family circumstances decipher whether you should have an abortion|`|acdc709fa5e2d178190fdde18844e0a4aa	For starters, regardless of your baby's father, your family should support you. Any family that doesn't is better off keeping their nose in the air so maybe they'll drown, or at least stay away from you. When a baby is coming it can be so hard. Worrying about one thing or another... None of it will matter once the baby is there. Go with what you feel is the right move. Becoming a mother is so scary, but everything is pretty scary at first. It all comes together in the end. Family may be negative but it's a fear of the unknown. If you do decide adoption as the route to take, you can make plans with a family beforehand to adopt your child. So you'll know them, they'll pay all your costs of pregnancy and medical bills, and you can ask to keep in some contact with them if you choose. If you decide to terminate the pregnancy, that is your choice too. Only you can say what's right for you. You know what you can handle. Don't let anyone make this important decision for you.|`|yKS2UI87aa	Well, you obviously love your baby as you have successfully talked yourself out of killing her so far.  I know it will be hard, but there are programs out there that will help you get an apartment etc. call Social Services now and get started. If you tell them that your family will kick you out b/c of the baby's skin color they may be able to help you find an apartment before the baby gets here. I am sorry your family is racist and won't accept an innocent baby. You are doing the right thing by not killing your baby, don't let ANYONE tell you different. I read you don't want to give her up for adoption (I don't think I would be able to either) but if you decide not to keep the baby after she is born there are plenty of good homes that would adore a baby no matter the skin color and maybe you could do an open adoption where you can get updates and see her. Good Luck!

I think that maybe everything in the bag.  Good Luck and pack what you think you may need.|`|HS6sFJPjaa	I packed PJ's to wear while there but never wore them...To be honest you will probably just want to wear the gowns they give you. Bring shower stuff, you will definitely want to take one as soon as possible! Socks or slippers (I didn't walk around much though), and stuff to read if you have time between visitors (and nurses coming in every 10 minutes). Bring a couple outfits for the baby in different sizes.

Even severly mentally handicapped people can use the toilet.  Ask your pediatrician.  That child should of been potty trained 10 years ago.|`|7oF2o4q5aa	He should do timed voidings.  Take him to the bathroom every 2 1/2 hours and sit him on the toilet.  Don't teach him to stand to urinate yet as this will help with bowel training too if that is also a problem.  No pull-ups or diapers after the first week.  Let him choose his own underwear.  <br>  <br>  In a month or so, if he will wear one, get him a watch with an alarm. Set the alarm for every 2 1/2 to 3 hours.  Whenever the watch beeps, he will need to go to the bathroom, even if he does not feel that he has to.  This is a bladder training exercise.    <br>  <br>  Restrict his fluids after 6:00 p.m. to just what he has at dinner time and make sure he urinates before bed.
cO9sxO9raa	My parents in law have 9 boys! =) Sadly my mom in law had 2 miscarriages and one stillborn but those 3 children were all boys too. You never know what your chances are, just wait and see. My best wishes to all of you and God bless. =)|`|44ccf078ecbbb80711e26204438034abaa	Nothing really to do with mom at all. She doesn't have any say so in the sex of the baby. The man does. If she gets an X chromosome from the guys sperm it will be a girl... if she gets the Y it will be a boy. But she has no say so whatsoever in that natures decision. Girls all carry X X chromosomes... <br>  <br>  With that said there is research that shows that girl sperm live longer and are slower. Boy sperm live shorter and are faster. So if she has sex further away from ovulation she is more likely to have a girl... closer to ovulation she is more likely to have a boy. But that is the only real way to tell. <br>  <br>  There really is no guessing. But unless there is something wrong with the male swimmers of her beau.... she's eventually going to probability wise get a little boy. Hopefully this is her time!|`|SLph9RX6aa	the babys sex is dependant on the males sperm, so your better off looking at dads side|`|BySzZAddaa	it could be a fluke it might be a boy|`|X9Dpyrg9aa	Wow!

JlDcVTVsaa	Hi Tamar.<br>  <br>  I read your previous questions and I think you are not asking your questions very clearly thats why you are not getting very good responses.<br>  <br>  This is what I understood from your questions:<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Your son Keneneth is 21 months old, and is leaving with his father and his girl friend which havent let you see your son for 3 months now, even tho the custody is under both. <br>  <br>  Keneneths fathers girlfriend hit you in front of your son, which made it a fight and it ended you hitting her back, and now she is playing the victim, and not letting you see your son. and your sons father is really scared of her and would do what ever she wants. <br>  <br>  And since the day of the fight your son has stopped talking, and you really dont know what to do.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  If what i understood is right, you can call the police or take your sons father to the court again, because even tho the court gave you both custody of Keneneth, his father doesnt let you see him. <br>  <br>  I think the fact that your son hasnt seen you in 3 months and the last time he saw you, you had a fight is making him not talk, and I really think that you need professional help in this case, your son ubviusly has been hurt alot emotionally that he is not talking. <br>  <br>  I hope that he will be better soon, and that you can see him again.<br>  <br>  Also I think you should post your question one more time, with more details (like what I wrote) and Im sure you will get much better answers.<br>  <br>  good luck :)|`|nFE6T6Hgaa	Take him to a pediatrician, they'll be able to help more than we can with somethig like this!|`|93C2PZetaa	I just took biology, and we learned about a genetic disorder called tay sachs disease in which a child grows normally for the first one or two years after birth, but then slowly starts to regress.

Both are very common causes for sleep disturbance in babies.|`|0b822c825c81fdba58631516562146c2aa	Sometimes changes throw them off of their sleep patterns. Children seem to thrive on consistency and if even one little thing is disturbed, their entire day is thrown off.  Perhaps talking with Father and letting him know of the child's routine will help.  It could also be the change of environment, different bed, different noises in the house, etc.  Good luck!|`|lnsOJ3GBaa	It's hard to answer this with such little detail. It would help to know the age of the child. And we don't know who patterson and halim are. Aside from that it could be the change. Be sure you keep yourself aware of what is going on. Its good to notice changes in behavior and keep note of all of these things on a calendar incase god forbid it actually turns into something more. (abuse.... exposure and so on)<br>  <br>  Why did he move in with his father, maybe extenuating circumstances but more than a change to his fathers house it could be the lack of his mother in his everyday life if he's previously used to having you there. <br>  <br>  Good Luck to you and God Bless|`|Wqhnkd0Saa	Moving can definately disrupt sleep.

pfisYml0aa	insert pen!s into the v@gin@, thrust, repeat intill ij@culate into v@gin@, sperm in v@gin@ swimms.....ah im done!!! have unprotected SEX!!!|`|e01ge0W6aa	Have sex frequently. It may seem like a no-brainer, but given many couples' hectic schedules, it's easy to overlook this one. If you're not timing your cycles or you have irregular periods, you can cover your bases by having sex every other day, say fertility specialists. <br>  <br>  Figure out when you ovulate. Women with very regular 28-day cycles can just count 14 days from the first day of their period to determine their ovulation date. If your cycles aren't regular (or even if they are), an ovulation kit can help you pinpoint your most fertile time. <br>  <br>  Most ovulation kits measure the level of luteinizing hormone (LH)  -- one of the hormones that signals the ovaries to release an egg  -- present in your urine. LH begins to surge around 36 hours before you ovulate, but most kits don't detect it until 24 hours prior. A woman with a 28-day cycle should start testing her urine on day nine or ten after the start of her period so she doesn't miss her surge. <br>  <br>  A new palm-size, electronic device called ClearPlan Easy measures LH and estrogen levels, and can signal ovulation up to five days in advance. <br>  <br>  Monitoring cervical mucus is another way to track ovulation. "It's not as reliable as a kit," says Sandra Carson, M.D., professor of ob-gyn at Baylor College of Medicine, in Houston, "but it doesn't cost anything." This method involves checking your secretions for a few months until you notice a pattern. Estrogen causes mucus to thin after your period, while rising levels of progesterone right after ovulation make it thicken. Once you pinpoint when you ovulate, you can plan to have sex several times leading up to that day. <br>  <br>  The drawbacks: Many women find this method inconvenient, or inaccurate since such factors as nursing and antihistamines, even fertility drugs, can dry up mucus. <br>  <br>  Charting your basal body temperature is useful for figuring out when you ovulate. "Your temperature usually dips by half a degree 24 hours before you ovulate; then it goes up as you ovulate," says Pette Zarmakoupis, M.D., an ob-gyn and director of the Kentucky Center for Reproductive Medicine, in Lexington. But since basal body temperature can be thrown off by a number of things, such as illness, don't rely on it alone <br>  Step up sex before ovulation. As soon as you pick up a hormonal surge, have sex that day, plus the next two days. Pregnancy rates peak two days before ovulation, says Clarice Weinberg, Ph.D., chief of biostatistics at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. Some experts speculate that's when cervical mucus is at its optimum for helping sperm travel to the egg and break down its shell-like coating. <br>  <br>  Sperm can live inside the uterus for 24 to 48 hours, which means there will be plenty on hand to greet the egg once ovulation starts. <br>  <br>  Another reason to have sex before you ovulate, as opposed to the day it happens: An egg survives for only 12 to 24 hours after ovulation, so if you begin to ovulate in the morning and wait until nighttime to have sex, the egg may lose its viability by the time the sperm gets to it. In addition, says Dr. Zarmakoupis, cervical mucus starts to become thick and impenetrable right after ovulation, rendering it "hostile" to the passage of sperm. <br>  <br>  Enjoy yourself. "The most important thing to remember is to keep sex fun," says Felicia Stewart, M.D., coauthor of Understanding Your Body: Every Woman's Guide to Gynecology and Health. When it becomes a chore, it's easy to view sex as just one more item on your to-do list. <br>  <br>  Give it time. Barring fertility problems and other conditions or habits that can interfere with conception, half of all couples get pregnant within six months, says Dr. Stewart, and 85 percent do so within a year.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.parenting.com/article/Fertility/Planning/tips-for-getting-pregnant" rel="nofollow">http://www.parenting.com/article/Fertili...</a>|`|eGwwrkdwaa	if you have a boyfriend ask him, he might inform you practically doing it, it will be better answer than mine, or if you have not try to find one.|`|ZSSUfSXwaa	Well I know only how you can get pregnant by a raccoon... oh yes racoon are vicious animals havent you heard??|`|tg89r7ZJaa	wow are you serous lets see have sex the man inserts his penis in to you and he Cumms in you and bam!<br>  <br>  Did you rally not know this????|`|g9ZFjl6paa	oh i dont know..let me ask my husband..<br>  <br>  wow thanks for the 2 points troll|`|yNki8leDaa	Seriously?...|`|Y3DR1EBUaa	Well gosh i hope u dont think u can by a woman|`|wKuQC4yTaa	Go to health class kid
Kn90YAzYaa	I think your chances of being pregnant are pretty good..

Get a test the week your period is supposed to show up.|`|fMvP3BIFaa	Why do so many people ask these questions? if you EVER had unprotected sex, you could be pregnant.

The trick is:<br>  1. As an infant the most important food a baby can get is breast milk / formula - it has everything they need to survive, develop and grow in it - but it doesn't seem to keep the baby full...so - <br>  2. When you make cereal for an infant use rice cereal - stay away from the other grain cereals until your little one is older. Do not add fruit or anything else to it. Use breastmilk / formula to make the cereal. <br>  3. Make the cereal a VERY watery consistancy - they can't chew and you don't want them to choke - it must be very loose, drinkable - as they get older, you can thicken it up...but not this young. The younger they are the runnier it should be.<br>  4. Never feed your baby cereal or any food from a bottle - the only thing that should come from a bottle is breastmilk or formula - this will make it easier to take the bottle away later on and also reduces problems with gas / choking from too much or too little of the cereal coming out at one time.<br>  5. When you first introduce the rice liquid to your baby, feed from a small infant spoon. The cereal should be room temperature or slightly warmer - not hot and not cold. Have your babies head slightly tilted upward in your arms, and pour (from the spoon) a tiny taste onto their tongue. Do this several more times.<br>  6. Do not expect the first couple of times that you introduce the rice cereal liquid to your infant to be a feast - it is just an introduction and the smallest bit will go a long way. After they get used to the new tastes / flavor they will like a little more as time go on.<br>  7. As you begin introducing rice cereal try only doing it at night - with the bedtime feeding (it will help them sleep through the night) and don't expect them to take a lot. Let their reaction guide you in how much you give. They may not take more than 3 tiny spoons - and that is okay. During the day - you should only give breast milk / formula (as this is the most important form of nutrition for an infant)<br>  8. If you notice any rash or stomach discomfort that seems to come from feeding the cereal - STOP feeding the cereal. Wait two weeks and try again. If it is a severe reaction, or it seems like your baby is having breathing problems / choking - call your doctor or 911 (whichever is appropriate) right away. It is rare for such a severe allergic reaction to rice cereal, but it can happen<br>  9. When selecting a rice cereal - or any food going forward, make sure it is the healthiest and best you can give...organic versions of infant products don't cost much more than their counterparts - but ARE WAY MORE NUTRITIOUS (no chemicals, no fillers, etc). Earth's Best offers a wide assortmant of products - but Gerber, etc is catching up with their own line of products.<br>  10. When you first start feeding your baby, you will notice that they seem to be pushing it back out with their tongue - they are not spitting the food out - it is called thrusting. This is the same action that they use to suck the milk from a nipple. Just "scrape" the food back up onto the spoon (as they push it out) and try again. If your baby falls asleep, doesn't seem interested, or turns away - it is time to stop trying to feed the cereal. The first few times that you try feeding the cereal, your baby will likely only taste one or two spoons: do not expect them to eat a lot (it is important that you do not force the cereal, just introduce it)<br>  11. If you begin introducing cereal to your baby - don't "hide" this from your doctor. Let them know this is something that you chose to do. Your pediatrician is your "guide" through parenting - not the "boss", that is you. He/she, should not have any adverse reaction to your decision. They should use this information to help guide your future food introduction timelines - by introducing cereal early, your baby will be ready for the progression at an earlier rate than babies that aren't given cereal until 4-6 months of age....Good luck!<br>  <br>  Check out the links below for lots of great baby food information!|`|uxjmNfOcaa	You can start putting cereal in a baby's bottle when they are about 3 months old; however, because my daughter was born so tiny her doctor let us give her about a tablespoon of cereal in her bottle at about 2 months old. BTW, I would definetly only start out using the rice cereal. Oatmeal can cause an allergic reaction in infants and it is better to give it to them when they are older. I hope this helps.|`|BCyg3SMBaa	Whenever your mommy insticts says its time. The week before my daughter turned four months old she started to "get bored" with her bottle, and went from going to 3 hours between feedings to struggling after an hour & a half. All the things I looked up online said "wait til she does this, wait til she does that, yada yada". My Daughter met most of the Milestones (Check out Gerber.com Under "Supported Sitter") but not all. She has also always had trouble with her Digestive system so i was a little nervous about giving to her. But my mommy radar was going off, saying it was time.<br>  So we made the cereal (Make it very very creamy. We started with 1 scoop of of gerber Rice Cereal with about 1 and a quarter ounce of formula and one baby spoonful of prunes (to aid her digestion of it). Should be creamy, almost like a melted milkshake). We Sat her in her high chair, and tried. She LOVED it. She giggled & laughed and was sooo happy.  Now I no not all babys might have this reaction, but im just trying to say that you know your baby better then anyone. And if you wana try it, and it doesnt work out, give it a week, and try again :)<br>  When my pediatrician found out he advised me against it because of her disgestive problems, but honestly she has never been better. The only problem we are having, is that were only giving it to her before bed, and shes starting to want food during the day.<br>  Best of Luck!!|`|FgbzP0VJaa	You should talk with a doctor about that. For different babies you start at different times. It all depends on how old and developed your baby is. Hope this helps.|`|Wqhnkd0Saa	4-5 months...whenever they start eating from a spoon and not pushing it all out with their tongue.|`|iFDye9RMaa	When your pediatrician says it's a go.|`|M6uIbKXRaa	anywhere from a year to two years depends if they have teeth yet or not|`|Y3DR1EBUaa	I started at 4 months but my son had bad bad constipation problems & cannot eat it at all
vue9NOhYaa	Your chances of pregnancy are somewhat less than your chances of winning the lottery or beign struck by lightning. <br>  <br>  Sex IS supposed to be fun, and if you're constantly freaking out over this, it's not going to be fun.  So either learn to relax, or find activities (sexual or otherwise) that have a 0% risk of pregnancy, rather than the .00001% you're already dealing with.|`|b90e42d25bd45025e46d388ab0c06d12aa	Your chances of getting preggers are very slim.  If you want to be sure you're not pregnant just take a test every few months, thats what I do.  I'm on the shot and don't get my period either so before I take the next dose the doc suggested to take a pregnancy test.  Other then that just talk to your partner about how you are feeling and just try and do things together to help you relax.  I agree with the first answer that sex should be fun and if you are as stressed as you seem to be then you're probably not enjoying it as much as you should.|`|xLSb3XgCaa	weight gain is a big side effect of birth control you sound like you are doing okey <br>  your shouldnt worry|`|MfDRFP7faa	no sex<br>  no sex <br>  no sex!
iFAlZfVMaa	some do get a "mini-period" even when pregnant... <br>  <br>  taking a test and having it confirmed by your dr or clinic is the only "FOR SURE" wy to find out...|`|2l7lbcJWaa	If you had your last period on Jan 30th then you're not even late. And no, there's no way you're pregnant. If you were, you wouldn't have had a period in Jan.|`|1F6KJt0oaa	Could be.  Take a test.  More than likely your period will start the first week or first weekend in March.  If it doesn't then you can be concerned.  If pull out is your protection then you need real protection.  That doesn't work.  Condoms are only about 60% effective.  The pill is really the only reliable birth control and it is only effective when taken exactly right with almost mechanic precision.  No guarantees but by this point if you are then a test will definitely show it.|`|diT2WFfCaa	Chances are, you aren't pregnant.  However, occasionally a woman will have what seems to be her period the first month she's pregnant. But since you used protection, you probably don't have much to be worried about.<br>  <br>  Take a test, and then talk to your doctor.  If you're not pregnant, you should discuss what might be causing your cycle to be irregular.|`|bq7HT1ePaa	Its unlikely but it is possible depending on the protection that was used.  I have two beautiful children that were conceived while I was on two different kinds of birth control.  During my first pregnancy I had my period for the first three months of my pregnancy.  If your man was just depending on pulling out then there is a very good possibility.|`|cnIzqEoDaa	The chances that you are pregnant are very very slim. You can always take a test to set your mind at ease. If it is negative, trust it. Stress can make your period even later.|`|xLSb3XgCaa	you probly are no pregnant bc its nornal for women to miss peirods <br>  but you could take a test just to make sure|`|wZyRPutYaa	yes you are very much pregnant stary buying pampers and wipes now
bnxUSHNBaa	I'm so sorry for what your going through but he is probably just stressing out. I'm sure he loves you and his kids, even the one on the way:) Just try going together to see a counselor or pastor. Good Luck and Congrats.|`|wZyRPutYaa	i'm going to be honest with you, he is cheating on you, and doesn't love you anymore, you should move on and find someone that appreciates you period|`|AA10212874	He may be stressed or scared about everything--I am so sorry--my husband is the same way and we only have 1|`|7c47435ed764615f7c9efed94837c93faa	I'm sure he is very stressed and probably overwhelmed.  Have you asked him why he is being this way?  At a time when things are calm and there is no anger, you could just bring it up.  See how he reacts.  And good luck to you.  You have a lot on your plate right now!<br>  <br>  badboynheat you are crazy!<br>    How does it make it her fault that he didn't put on a condom, get snipped etc?  They had sex as a married couple and got pregnant.  Yet somehow you blame him being an *** on her?  And she is pregnant.  Weight gain comes along to the party.<br>    Grow up.|`|4XfjUcvDaa	Personally I think that he is just stressed out.  All of this has happened in his life in the past year or so, that many people have 5 years for marriage and 3 kids to happen.<br>  <br>  Maybe you should try to talk to him and ask him how he is feeling to see if there is something that you can do.<br>  <br>  I think alot of pregnant woman seem to forget that they are not the only ones who are changing their life's, its the men to.  But he cant be to mad at you for being pregnant seeing as it takes 2 to tango!|`|bq7HT1ePaa	He is probably stressed out and doesn't know how to handle it.  Especially with 8 mo. old twins already I'm sure it is a very scary thought.  It doesn't sound like it has anything to do with you gaining weight, I think you were right it's just because all of the stress of things happening so fast.  Hope things settle down for the two of you.|`|11f8c2acef2ca75ea704f2ffd97b264eaa	first of all, you plainly answer your own question as soon as you asked it.<br>  <br>  unwanted kids and unwanted weight on a wife are some things that drive men out of relationships.  put them both together and most men will be 'working late' for a long time.<br>  <br>  just curious, if you knew the first 2 kids put such a strain on the relationship, why didn't you get some good birth control to prevent this from happening again so soon?|`|1F6KJt0oaa	More than likely it is a mixture of stress and freaking out.  You guys haven't been married long and you are having your third kid.  That is a tough thing to handle and an even tougher thing to afford.  He might leave.  I don't say that to be mean or to try to freak you out but it happens when a guy is already fighting an uphill battle against his family and possibly his friends for this relationship but the relationship takes a turn for the more difficult some guys freak out.  I think you already suspect that is a possibility.  There isn't anything you can do to stop it if that is what he is thinking.  You just have to let him figure things out.  If he does it won't be your fault.  If he leaves it shows he is weak if he stays you just have to understand that it is going to be rocky for a while cause it is going to be stressful on both of you and you are both likely to have improper responses to things.  How you deal with those situations will be the biggest indicator.|`|mFQydvncaa	Its probably him worried about the next baby,  i mean think last year he wasnt married, now a year later he is on baby 3. its alot on men as us women usually adapt a lot better. They cant understand. You need to tell him how you feel. If the problem is deeper then you may want to handle it now before it turns into something more serious! He should be home with you right after work, its a lot on you to have 2 small children and be pregnant! i couldnt imagine.<br>  <br>  I wish you luck!
enqtxuUVaa	Yes i did i had them for about 3 weeks. I thought i was just going to get my period 2. Bloating as well. Turned out i was pregnant im now 12 weeks. If your late do a test. good luck x|`|fYMWDQLGaa	Hi dear, <br>  <br>  I am on TTC from feb. i also have irregular periods. right now i am TWW but with no hope. I am trying to avoid all the symptoms i show up. cos ppl say that when we really want to get prego, our body tunes to it and shows many pregnancy symptoms as though we are pregnant. <br>  <br>  why i didnt keep my hopes up was i didnt BD on the day i ovulated. i BD before and after the day I O. also i was trying to hold up the semen,  <br>  but then many came both the times.so i am planning to buy pre-seed so that it will take some amount of semen inside it.<br>  <br>  i felt symptoms like sore nipples from 2 dpo to 6 dpos (that really hurt a lot, i didnt have that before im my life time), creamy lotiony dischrge from 4-5 dpos. mild twingee feeling near right uterus. all these symptoms went off except the twingy feeling, i am feeling it today also.<br>  its really a waiting game hunni.. if you get stressed , the stress itself will bing your AF even if u have chances of pregnant. No one can help noticing the symptoms thats happening in them, if we pressure more those symptoms, it will fail us.<br>  <br>  as you said, you are not the only one who is impatient while on TTC, even the woman with patience of the whole world will freak out when she is on TTC. so dont worry. keep your spirit up. Huggles to you... Loads of baby dust to you....|`|ESAM0U7xaa	i'm in your boat now. i got of my bc and we weren't trying, but not preventing. now that i could be i am too excited. but i've been testing and all negative. i would have just OV on the 16-17th so i know it's too early. <br>  if it doesn't happen this time it will be a few months because he is goin out of state to work :(<br>  but i've had some slight ovary pain (not OV) in the last couple days and a lil cramping. i've never had cramping before AF but i've also been on the pill, so cramping may come back now. <br>  last test i took came up a VERY faint negative line, never had that happen before, so i'm wondering what that means. also been bloated and some headache pains. <br>  Good Luck!<br>  don't get too anxious or you will feel pregnant. :)

I would ask your doctor if I were you. There is a good chance that she will be better placed to answer than anyone here.|`|wiAVa1H5aa	At 24 weeks it would not be a full grown baby, it would be a tiny baby about 1lb, and it is not a miscarriage - after 20 weeks it's a stillbirth.   If you haven't had the stillbirth confirmed by ultrasound, then it was probably a loss of either your mucus plug or something and a slight placental abruption.   If you haven't already made an appointment with your doctor it's time to do so now and ascertain what really happened.|`|rjVALevtaa	That's not a miscarriage, that's a stillbirth. At 24 weeks the baby would still be relatively small.<br>  <br>  Stillbirths usually happen because your body was unable to support your growing baby. Ask your doctor to be sure.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind that this doesn't mean you won't be able to have a healthy baby in the future. <br>  <br>  I'm sorry you had to go through this. It sounds terrible. :(|`|3qLIRorjaa	That photo you showed us was not a foetus of 24 weeks.

When there is a developmental or genetic problem your body will often abort the baby.|`|U2tx9gDHaa	Why dont you ask the doctor?|`|b8f0CfSsaa	Has your doctor confirmed this as a miscarriage? Babies are born and survive fully at 21 weeks (a case in the UK of a boy named Michael proved this) so that is why people think you are Trolling, because miscarriages at that stage don't just come out in your blood. At that stage you would have to have induced labour...either you are very young and you haven't been informed of the process or your lying. Sorry I can't really judge and know what to believe because at that stage a baby simply would not just dissolve.|`|Rhr1umV1aa	There is no way to tell exactly why this happened. In no way should the baby have been full grown. There are babies that are born in the 7th month that are tiny. I don't know who is telling you that the baby should be full grown but she was nowhere close honey. The baby at 24 weeks is only about 8 1/2 inches long and only weighs at the most 1 1/2 lbs.

3X0t8JrXaa	I think as long as the baby is okay then there shouldn't be any cause for alarm...some women don't gain weight until the very very end.  I'm 20 weeks and have only gained 9 pounds total and at 5 foot 2 that put me at 90 lbs ( I was underweight to begin with).  My doctor was ready to "high-five" me at 90 lbs...LOL.  You can barely tell I'm pregnant...unless you knew me before then it seems something is different...but I look more like I have a beer belly than anything else.  As long as baby is right length and weight...heartbeat is ok...then just continue doing what you're doing.  A co-worker's OBGYN told her the same thing and I'm not sure why because she had put on quite a bit of weight (everywhere).  I think doctors sometimes have a tendancy to compare you to other patients.  Just keep taking your vitamins (I don't even do that).|`|AA11085356	You're probably fine. Not everyone gains as much as they say you are supposed to. My friend was only 115 at 9 months. She only gained about 15-20 pounds throughout her whole pregnancy.|`|wKuQC4yTaa	most people have gained more at this point. im 24 weeks and gained 25lbs. but just make sure your taking in enough calories daily. you are fine. some people just don't gain much weight|`|4CMx1uzXaa	Well you cant be that underweight you got pregnant! If your body was ok and accepted a pregnancy, it should be fine.|`|AA12107546	it is very good..cause the baby take most of ever thing you eat.talk to your doctor on what you should do..|`|H7L66ynJaa	No problem but make sure you take enough vitamins|`|T48smu01aa	your fine as long as your baby is healthy then don't worry about it people can gain a whole lot of weight or not so much at all as long as your eating healthy like you said and taking your vitamins you good! :)
6xf1GfbUaa	Kind of cute, but definitely not sexy :)|`|Z8Ui1ugLaa	My daughter's name is Katelyn and right now I call her Kate.  I think Katie is a cute name but can be outgrown and isn't sexy.  I think the name Kate can be considered Sexy, but I'm living in preschool years right now and don't want to connect that name with Sexy for a long, long, long, long, extra long time.  LOL|`|dd8cb229ee241de8ca385f84ec4b33d7aa	Cute, not Sexy|`|tSEA42Uraa	I believe you should have titled your question, "Who else thinks the nickname Katie is cute or sexy?" Nickname only.<br>  <br>  I certainly would never consider it "sexy". Cute, maybe, as a nickname for a girl aged 1 through 7, but after that, not so much.<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  ~Emily-Maria|`|gu1sEQN8aa	Um only cute but definitely not sexy since it sounds like a preschoolers name only.|`|YrHwZw6zaa	Well, I really like the name Katie it's really cute.

My name is Caitlin and I used to hate it when I was little but now I love it! I think Kaitlyn, Kaitlin, Caitlin or Caitlyn would be better for names because you can be called Katie when your younger and Kaitlin when your older (Kaite sounds like I young girl's name).|`|j4TVdVOZaa	its pretty but aslong as people actually pronounce the "t" otherwise it sounds awful!!|`|DnYTMtTkaa	It's quite common but i still like it.|`|dR2bqUixaa	Don't like it.

Its only March 4, one day later, so please don't panic.  I would keep a close eye on everything for the time being.  If you period doesn't show up by Saturday or Sunday, I would go see your Dr. first thing Monday.  Also, you might want to call your Dr. and see what they recommend you doing...a professional opinion is always best with your type of circumstances.|`|UMyrFtWPaa	I know how it feels....me and my hubby tried for two years! Lots of times my period came in late only to find out that it was false alarm.<br>  <br>  However, those late periods usually were three to four days. When i missed my period for a week I still did not believe that I was pregnant. Then I took a home pregnancy test and there were two lines but one of them was a faint line. At that time I did not want to cling on false hope.<br>  <br>  Then two weeks after it was confirmed that I am pregnant! <br>  <br>  Just be patient...after a week or two try a preg test. Usually, preg tests do not turn out to be positive after ten days from conception. You might have tested too early.<br>  <br>  Either way, good luck to you!|`|XRM30ja9aa	Wait a little longer take your test first thing in the morning and if not call the doctor blood tests are more effective.

a79b376f814b9b52daa5b96365dcd2caaa	It sounds like one of you wants a baby and one does not.  having another baby DOES NOT help your marriage...that is a really a ridiculous statement.  If one or other of you does not want a baby you should not have one.  It could end us costing you your marriage and the love of the precious daughter you already have.  How about fostering a child.  there are thousands of children desperately in need of love and help.|`|pS02JGTUaa	i think you should definately have another child, it'd be great for you and your marriage.<br>  its not up to your daughter if you have a child, because its yours and she will eventually learn to love it.<br>  you should do it :D|`|AA11280073	Just do it. Your daughter will love the baby and get over her jealousy. It will be great for the baby, too. My oldest sister was 15 when I was born. She became my second mother. I love her dearly.|`|b3c054cf8a809cd78b23404a2feecb7daa	Your daughter is too old to be acting stubborn about the mention of a baby. Have one if you and your husband want one. Don't regret it when you're too old and end up resenting your daughter for putting you off the idea when it was what you really wanted. If shes not happy, tell her that legally she can move out in 6 months, and then she won't have to worry.|`|mBfvthNaaa	It is a decision that you and your husband should make, it isn't your daughters decision.  If you really want one, go for it.  I had my youngest at the age of 34, my other two are ten years older.  I would consider the fact that your oldest will be out on her own soon.  You might enjoy having time alone with your husband.|`|RAatxTeSaa	Have another baby!!!|`|mQ8e5jZnaa	Well first, its not up to your daughter, she will not be raising this child.  This is between you and your husband, the fact that you are still together, means a lot, but how is the  strength of your marriage?  Having children in a shaky marriage will only complicate matters further.  Sometimes only children are spoiled, so leave her out of the equation, and trust me if you do decide to have a baby she will be on board.  Stop talking and make a decision you both can live with.  Dont wait too much longer,|`|f1006988bdbdd7ae5e5276623f046308aa	Don't worry about what your daughter. she will be moving on sooner then you think and she is at that all about me age.<br>  If you and your hubby both want the baby then go for it.<br>  But only if you both really want it.<br>  You can't worry about cost, time, expenses other wise nobody would ever have kids.|`|M04TBx3Baa	You need to have a "family meeting" and talk about this with everyone. If your daughter disagrees talk to her and tell her how much you want a baby. This is a big desicion and you need to envole everyone.|`|uaIUBYTcaa	Have another baby.

AA10196172	Ovulation normally happens about 2 weeks before your period is due - so a test 2 weeks later (or when you're overdue) should be accurate.<br>  <br>  If the test says positive, you are. It's almost never wrong that way.<br>  <br>  If the test says negative, you may be pregnant but not producing enough hGC (pregnancy hormone). This happens once in a while for some women. The test is not really sensitive. If you still see several symptoms (not just missing period) then try another test every so often. If they are still negative and you still think something is going on, the doctor can do a blood test which is much more sensitive.|`|Z8Ui1ugLaa	You can take a pregnancy the day you miss your period. Take the test in the morning with your first pee, home pregnancy tests are pretty accurate.  Good Luck|`|ZSSUfSXwaa	If you're worried go take a TEST! First Response is usually quite accurate. If you're already late for your period then there's no need to keep on waiting any longer Just do it with the first morning pee... and you'll find out. If it's negative and then days go by and stll you dont get your period you will need to see a doctor.|`|2lv3Xwyqaa	All the tests at the Drug Store are reliable for the most part.

Our hormones and brains can trick us into feeling pregnant. We start to worry and our periods come late. The only way to know for sure it to do a urine or blood pregnancy test. Since you are late, a pregnancy test would show positive by now. Good luck!|`|dv70AWh0aa	i was in the same boat.<br>  if you are pregnant, you should have had implantation bleeding around when your period was due.<br>  also you should be feeling other symptoms, like nausea, sore breasts, and fatigue. if you feel any of these i would definately go do a pregnancy test!<br>  good luck|`|GfR2qdyiaa	read the boxes in the chemist, some tests can be done really soon after missing your period now, and they are really 99% accurate!! best of luck, it could be due to stress or weight loss though.|`|nISjD0dHaa	You need to take a hpt.

FLpMShKNaa	That is rough-it seems perhaps he isn't get sound sleep. My son is the same age, and occassionally he does the same thing in the night, I'll go rub his back and he'll stop. But every night is rough. I have a couple of ideas-we found my son slept much more soundly with an early bedtime, when does he go down? Kids can get overtired without showing itnad the more they fight sleep the less restful it is- so try a bedtime 6-8 p.m. My son did do 7:30 or so but with being so active right now he sleeps 7-7. If any medical issues like ear problems or sleep apnea have been ruled out, I recommend the healthy sleep habits, healthy child book it has good advice and the author really backs it up  with research. It sounds like your son is sleeping, just not soundly. Good luck and I wish you all a good night's sleep. We went thru sleep issues too.|`|ggETPqedaa	My baby boy does that too, not so much anymore. However, what we did was go in quietly and just rub his back a little or pat his butt.  It would calm him down slowly.|`|Wqhnkd0Saa	My kids get night terrors.

If he's not actually awake needing something, I don't know how you can fix it.|`|oA8Rtyxuaa	If he seems to be asleep but is crying, it is probably night terrors.

Better to wait til about 2 days before.|`|e01ge0W6aa	With my two pregnancies, I tested at 10 days past ovulation with First Response early, which was 3 days before my period was even due.

They didnt have birthcontrol which made the whole problem of having 10+ kids the norm. <br>  <br>  YOu cannot compare octomom to the 40-50's. Its just a stupid remark. Shes a single *** woman, living off foodstamps, that has no husband, that has no house really isnt it suppose to be auctioned tomorrow??, no money.....<br>  <br>  <br>  Plus she said god granted her these babies!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  Am i the only intelligent one in the world that thinks when you get ivf or whatever she got YOU ARE PLAYING GOD><br>  <br>  Nadya: god didnt want you to have children, otherwise you would have got pregnant the usual way. He didnt bless you with anything. You went behind his band and put a litter of babies in your womb.|`|ghz5D5iLaa	The difference would be that those families from 40 years ago took care of their own. They did not lie about their lives and they did not want taken care of. No one is thinking that they are better than she is. They are questioning why she would bring children into this world to live that life, children that she cannot take care of. She is not even self sufficient. The big problem that I have with her is she lied and she can't take care of the kids. Loving kids is great and so is wanting a bunch, them having to go hungry is not.|`|hl5WdXnbaa	I agree with you to a point...because everyday people have kids they can not afford...not just this women. I guess it is because it was 8 at once that made it so shocking.<br>  <br>  I am a bit amused at the folks who think that big families had it easier back then and took care of their own... that was not always the case. They may not of had welfare...so the kids just went hungry instead. Or the older kids had to quit school to work to help feed the family.   I am from a fishing community and it was common at the age of 10- 12 years for the boys to leave school to go work on the boats with their Dad's. They had big families not just because they were Catholic but because there was NO birth control. My Mother had 10 kids, we were dirt poor and did not even have indoor plumbing. My siblings and I went to bed hungry many times. My parents had no business having all of us kids that they could not afford either. My husband comes from a family of 13 with a similar story.|`|irLnPW4aaa	Because people in the 50s who had a lot of children close in age were MARRIED, they had ONE child at a time and THE PARENTS supported the chidren by having jobs (Dad) and caring for the children (Mom).   They didn't have more children they could afford, 8 at once, as a single parent with no job, and no apparent means to support them.|`|bMyq2nOTaa	As far as I can tell, it's because she's single, and doesn't have a job, thus her ability to properly care for them, is questioned.<br>  <br>  As for myself, I am SO over this debate!|`|VLRZT9Foaa	Those women had husbands and took care of their kids.<br>  <br>  She's an idiot - no husband, no job, and unable to care for the ones that she already had.<br>  <br>  Oh wait.... the rest of us can go to work to raise them.|`|OTvymEWGaa	Parents 30 and 40 yrs ago took care of their children.  They did not expect Food Stamps, Disability, and Medicaid to pay for everything.  They had jobs and paid for what their children needed by themselves.  <br>  <br>  Since you are Catholic, why are you not criticizing the fact that she had artificial insemination?  Isn't that against your religion?<br>  <br>  I myself would like to have more children, but I cannot afford it, and I refuse to go on welfare to do it.|`|R87OtezSaa	WOW, with a name like "Boozy" I am sure you are a great addition to society! Go drink another one, sister!!!!! <br>  <br>  I agree that this woman is getting entirely too much attention in the media. Why aren't they focusing on the Dr.??? He should be the one getting all of the attention. It is a Dr.'s responsibility to protect his or hers patients, and I don't think that he did that at all!<br>  <br>  Is it irresposible for this woman to continue popping out child after child? Certainly! But she isn't the only case of this ... what about all of the families on Welfare that continue to have child after child? What about the illegal immigrants that come to the United States and start having children, and then we end up paying for them as well? The bottom line is that people have children they can't pay for everyday, but it isn't fair for this one mother to take the blunt of everyones frustration. We elected the officials that determine how Welfare is handled ... if we don't like it, then we shouldn't be screaming at this mother (who obviously has way bigger issues to deal with), we should be taking our frustrations to our elected officials!|`|T9fek24eaa	Ok the only thing I have to say is having a 9 month old and a new born is NOT the same thing as having multiples. That just shows your ignorance. <br>  <br>  The difference in the families years ago and Octamom is they did whatever was necessary to keep a roof over their kids heads and feed. State Assistance did not exist back then so either you took care of your kids or they died.<br>  <br>   Nadya Sulleman lives with her parents and they are about to lose the house that is TOO small for them all to live in, so where do they live? 14 cribs with 6 extra little toddler beds in an alley??? They are living on State Assistance, that is their ONLY option. There is no way this woman could have a job because there is no way she could pay for child care for 14 kids. You do the math...|`|XtDEUKVsaa	Because, the psycho has no job, no one to help her (other than her parents whom SHE put to bankruptcy), and the fact that she has FOURTEEN children all under the age of 8 years old. If i'm doing my math correctly, any woman who had a child every 9 months could not possibly have FOURTEEN kids in under 8 years, unless she had twin after twin after twin (which i don't believe any woman has ever done this). <br>  <br>  OH... and the fact that she has NO house suitable for 14 kids, NO money for them, NO job, AND she's on government assistance Did anyone else see how truly crazy she was when she said she wasn't on welfare, and when they found out she was she was like "oh... no I don't consider it welfare because I need it... that's not welfare"... oh the f*ck yes it is when it's MY tax dollars being spent! If a woman wants to have 14 kids, then all the more power to them. But at least they have a way to pay for them! This woman is obviously insane, and those babies need to be taken from her.|`|VwMkiLFPaa	Waaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!<br>  <br>  This woman can’t afford the 6 kids she currently has. And she gave birth as an UNEMPLOYED woman to 8 preemies. This isn’t even anything that can compare to the 50’s and 60’s. <br>  <br>  Sorry, but she’s a screw up no matter how you try to spin it. <br>  <br>  And for a woman who isn’t wanting her face all over the news, she sure as heck has a funny way of showing it. (Her website asking for donations and comments, her “video diary”. PUH-LEASE. Go cry to someone else hunny!)
d666c2be64ceba00657540ace50128e4aa	You don't have to wear Gym clothing...just make sure it's comfortable to move and tumble in.  Jeans are okay for you if you're comfortable in them because you won't do as much as he will but I would definitely put your son in comfy cotton pants/shorts or something along those lines that will be easy for him to do all kinds of things freely in. Have fun and take a camera!|`|PA7LOoQ9aa	i would wear comfy clothes. put your toddler in sweats and either a tshirt or ls shirt depending the weather and tennis shoes. as for you may not think you'll be doing anything but sure will be running after kids, so i would suggest sweats and casual shirt or loose fitting jeans and casual shirt so you can move freely and be comfy.|`|q2aA2oo7aa	Well if you wont be participating i say where jeans and a tee, but your son should where gym clothes because he will probably be taking part in various activities and will want to be comfy,|`|dd8cb229ee241de8ca385f84ec4b33d7aa	You should stay away for jeans for the boy<br>  He should wear sweats or shorts or pants with out medal(zippers or on pockets).  Most jeans have that, they could damage the Equipment<br>  <br>  You should not have to participate, I would ask when you RSVP
u6RvhmqZaa	Relax, you're stressing yourself out over nothing.<br>  You wouldnt be having those symptoms yet.<br>  If it makes you feel better, wait two weeks and take a pregnancy test.|`|ae3jH7Ofaa	you may be. best bet would be a pregnancy test.
EzmU6K3laa	In-home or live-in? In-home come and go is probably $350 to $500/week depending on your city.<br>  <br>  I have had live-in childcare for more than 5 years and I think you would be hard pressed to do that for under $20,000 a year. When you finally add everything up, you are probably in the $25,000 a year range but you have a ton of flexibility. That is my recommendation.<br>  <br>  I wrote a book about live-in childcare and the au pair process. If you are interested in considering live-in childcare, check out the book. It may help. :) www.hostfamilyhandbook.com.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|WGCa811vaa	Depends on where you live.  I would expect at the very minimum of $250/week. With a live in you may be able to pay a little less but you would probably have to provide medical insurance plus have a room for the person.  When I was a nanny (almost 20 years ago) I made $175/week for three kids the youngest of which was special needs.  I had a nice room, they paid my medical insurance, gave me a car to drive, paid car insurance and gave me money for gas for work related travel.  (As I stated the youngest was special needs and had lots of drs & therapy appts)  I was not expected to cook or clean for anyone other than myself though I did help out if I wasn't busy with the kids.  They also took me on vacation with them.  For me it was wonderful.  The couple I worked for had friends that went through 4 nannies the first year so it can be difficult.  Someone with education and excellent references will be more than someone with no experience - obviously.  I would talk to an agency in your area if you are interested in a live in.  You could check the papers in your area to get an idea of price for care in your home.
eU5Eth2aaa	I'm not sure if the head lice shampoo will affect the baby, but an all natural solution is to cover your hair and scalp with REAL mayonnaise.  Put a shower cap on and let it sit for an hour.  Rinse out the mayo.  The oils from the mayo smother the lice...not to mention it makes your hair silky smooth!  It may take a couple washes to get the mayo out, but it's worth it.|`|yPNvecc7aa	I would call the doctor's office and get a professional opinion. However, I'm sure it's fine.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|jBdvUQEXaa	I would avoid the shampoo but get yourself a bugbuster / nit comb and do a thorough comb through of your hair, it is 100% natural and works as well. It takes a couple of comb throughs over a couple of days.<br>  <br>  I dont use the chems on my kids as they have very sensitive skin.<br>  <br>  Claire|`|iWUAWkNNaa	I don't see how that would be possible.
JILkhKjJaa	I am also a single mother and my youngest son is 13. They are all the same. I know it is very frustrating, but they also grow out of it. Anything you ask him to do he will complain about, so just count to 10 (often) and wait untill he grows out of it!!|`|AA10236694	don't we all have this problem .But what i noticed is i was always asking my son to do thing "HENCE" the word asking .in his 13 year old mind it was like i was giving him a choice like would you take out the trash ? verses Take out The trash . would you clean your room ? verses clean your room. once i changed them to demands instead of choices he new i was serious .|`|fMvP3BIFaa	The problem is that your giving him options. Tell him that you don't need his attitude or him ignoring you. Sit down have a talk with him and tell him that when you say something he needs to pay attention. The FIRST time he doesnt listen take aways his phone, tv, allowance, going out, exc. Do not repeat yourself because he's getting just what he wants.|`|nVhP1Bteaa	A 13yo who won't do what he's asked right away? Perfectly normal. If your son views you as the "grouchy enemy" then you're doing a good job of being a mother. I tip my virtual hat to you on a job well done.|`|pTcm0wttaa	as long as hes getting it done i would think its okay but don't forget he is 13 and he probably has a lot other things on his mind. also maby you should just talk to him about it too.|`|5mEudm9Haa	Take the course Growing Kids God's Way.  It is SO practical.  It will change your life!  In this case, it will help you deal with him not coming to first time obedience.  Mom shouldn't have to repeat herself 10 times!  It talks about giving our children too many freedoms before their maturity level and how that poses problems.  You are a mom, you are supposed to gripe!  If no one cared about this boy to teach him, it will be harder for him to deal with life when he is older!  There is a whole discipline chart to follow regarding obedience and I was surprised to see that because I always thought there should be a flow chart so we, as parents, know where to progress when our children need help to regulate their behavior.  Good luck!<br>  <br>  ----Update----<br>  Oh yeah, have him say "Yes, Mom." with whatever you ask him to do.  It seems as though once a child confirms a yes, then they are obligated to do because it came out of their own mouths.  But, if he still does not comply after saying "Yes, Mom" then it is outright defiance and it needs to be punished.|`|hKJIDdVqaa	Well any normal parent would get aggravated by that.  All kids think their parents are the enemy.  It is what it is.  Keep being presistant.|`|T864ejaiaa	that's a teen for ya. wait til he gets mouthy. you might want to go to counseling with him. good luck|`|zH1sg3Xraa	Well, you can try setting up a system of positive rewards for good behavior. This is a positive method of rewarding good behavior. When he does something good, say something positive. Reward good grades. Try starting an evening walk together or join the local YMCA together. Do a good exercise routine together. Try to make your life together more positive. Find something that you both like to do like walking or bowling team or take a karate class together. Walk the dog together. Good Luck.|`|P4LBygv2aa	get a chore list together , and simply say these are your responsibilities , if you do not follow them you do not go out , if your room is a mess I will clean it with a trash bag for you , after this you  will never hear me gripe again , I will not argue with you anymore , done , and then follow through , he'll get it , mine did. hes 13. <br>  remember do not argue just say it and leave .|`|85vDqn6naa	Sounds like a perfectly normal 13 yr old boy, maybe try to implement a reward system for doing what he is told the first time, i am having the same battles with my 6 yr old, good luck!|`|Ki6jlwnbaa	He's 13 years old, it happens. I'd be more worried if you had a 13 year old who listening all the time.
1gTyjpHdaa	I think that when you stand your uterus as well as other organs tend to be more prominent, causing the harder stomach.  When you lay down, things "rearrange" themselves and move backwards a bit in your body.  In a few  weeks or so you will most likely notice that your belly is "hard" all the time.  Good luck with the rest of the pregnancy. :)|`|2ObqoJbKaa	Your probably just starting to a little now. Everyone's body is different, so don't worry if it takes a few more weeks before you really start to notice yourself showing more. good luck.|`|mGhzmZC2aa	Sounds like what happened to me. I could feel my belly getting hard at around 10 weeks, but it was still squidgy when I lay down. I didn't actually start showing until I was about 18 weeks I think, but something's definitely happening for you there! :)
WA8Pee7vaa	it depends.  A male has to be able to ejaculate first (the release of sperm from the penis)  So most likely the male has gone or is going through puberty age varies.|`|5ci9IZd2aa	As soon as puberty hits, usually 12|`|Lwf8Xj4vaa	well , <br>  it depends. pretty much as soon as puberty hits he can go for it,<br>  or after they have what is called a 'wet dream'.<br>  /|`|AA10226047	As soon as the male hits puberty, they can start making babies.  Some guys hit puberty between 12-16.
uFrqC4Y2aa	Yes, it's because your baby is growing a lot right now. As long as there is no bleeding while you are having the cramps then you are okay.|`|3X0t8JrXaa	My doctor said it would lighten up by 18 weeks.  I'm 20 weeks and I still get it briefly here and there.  Every woman is a little different...your uterus just isn't done doing what it needs to do :-)|`|iXSoX6Rnaa	it's normal as long as there isn't any bleeding. I'm 8 months pregnant and I still have cramps.|`|rAD0mL7Saa	it's ok if they're not strong and don't last for too long. it's probably just your uterus contracting and uncoiling and expanding. it happens every 20 minutes of your whole life from your first period, and pregnancy is one of the times you can feel them. If they actually hurt, call an ambulance and lie down and try to stay as calm as possible.|`|piCMW7ZCaa	It could be.  As the baby grow, your uterus grows and stretches, and could cause cramping.  As long as there is no blood, then you should be ok,
641ef355c3ba077004c47f9ce2106922aa	Possible. Normally you'd get light bleedings/stainings throughout the first few weeks, but if it's heavy, go and see your doctor asap.|`|BO28Mn8haa	2 weeks? wow i don't think you are pregnant. i think you should talk to your doctor. either that or something could be wrong with the pregnancy you should really call the DR.|`|5RvTXdmUaa	If you've been bleeding two weeks, you should really speak to your doctor. Even if you have no pain.|`|hWc65sEtaa	Yes people have periods during pregnancy all the time, but normally you wouldn't.  Just inform your dr about it.|`|uFrqC4Y2aa	Having your period while pregnant isn't common. I would ask your doctor because that would vary case by case.
Lqy9Lc9Oaa	I feel your pain.  I tried for almost 2 years too.  Hopefully you are pregnant this time!<br>  <br>  Did you say in a previous question that you had a dye test recently?  I had the dye test and bam I got pregnant right away.  I believe that I had a tiny obstruction and the dye test unblocked it.<br>  <br>  Being in limbo sucks!  I wish the best for you!|`|M9mjCEQpaa	First of all, it is normal to think you are having these symptoms when you are trying to conceive.  I use to have all those symptoms at once when we were trying.  Unfortunately all these symptoms don't happen right away if you are only 20 days late.  It is possible you think you are pregnant because you want to be.  Trust me I have been there one to many times!  Belly moving and stretching doesn't happen if you are only 20 days late and heartburn that doesn't come until the end.  Headaches, backaches, and tenderness to the breast are some of the first symptoms.  Also nausousness is ONE OF THE VERY FIRST SIGNS.  The smell thing happens in the first tri-mester as well, but not with every pregnancy.  I had it with my first and second, but not my third.  My first pregnancy I would get sick with the smells, my second it wasn't that bad, and my third I didn't have the sense at all!  I mean I could smell, but it wasn't strong like with my first. So I would just relax, it is possible that you are pregnant, but the blood work will be the most accurate.  Good luck!|`|opQbQVreaa	20 days late is long time. It is a good thing that you are going in for blood work tomorow. Hopfully that will provide you with the answers that you need.<br>  <br>  I have heard of a lot of couples becomming preggo soon before they were to start IVF
qMYbGqiwaa	My daughter developed severe cradle cap at 5 months and I started putting olive oil in her hair each night and massaging it with a soft baby hair brush and she started growing A TON of hair!!  I don't know if it was just the timing or if it was the olive oil, but it's worth a try.  Just wash the oil out during her bath- leave it in about an hour.|`|AA12235978	Leave your poor kid alone and just love her for who she is, not what she looks like.  Her hair will come in eventually.  I know people mistake her for a boy, they did with my little girl too, but when it started growing, it didn't stop.  By the time she was 3 she had beautiful blonde hair past her mid-back.  Just give it time.|`|tZt7fUYYaa	dont shave her head....please dont. thats awful. I have never heard anyone say that. My mum cut my hair short when i was about 4 as i had extremely thin hair and i ended up having a double crown or something and extremely annoying frizzzy thick hair. Wiat until she is older and then you can maybe cut it shorter but dont shave it.|`|M9mjCEQpaa	Are you hispanic?  The reason I ask is not to be rude, but in some cultures they believe this to be true and with respect to your culture if this is what they believe then do it, but if not I think that you should just wait.  She is only one years old.  At 1 my daughter had little hair...she is 19 months and her hair is growing and getting thick and full.  My mother who is hispanic told my husband and I to shave her head when she was 11 months old almost one and I said no!  I am glad I waited because she would have taken longer for it to grow out.  I waited and now her hair is long and full.  It is to her shoulders, but it will get there by the time she is 2 it will be nice and full.  Just give it time.  Don't shave it because I also heard it will grow out full and thick and later on she may hate your for it.|`|AA12251362	Wow i have never heard anyone say that before...that is just completely beyond me...I would never do that to my child...my daughter is now 19 months but for at least the first year of her life she had a mohawk...it's just the way her hair grew in...yes I got comments all the time about how "crazy" her hair was but I would NEVER have thought to save my daughters head...do you know how itchy and uncomfortable she is going to be let alone how completely wrong that is?|`|CVdcrY3kaa	I can in no way wrap my mind around why you would do that. So what if her hair is taking a while to grow in thick and long? I don't really see why you would shave your babies head...|`|aUKa1rzhaa	My first daughter was sooo bald, she could have passed for an elderly man!!  Family always told me to shave her head for the same reason.. but I never had enough courage..  She is almost 11 now and has so much thick hair,  it's unbelievable!!  She's young.. give it some time..  You could just keep using the head bands until her hair grows out more.  Don't cut it until she's at least 2.  It worked for me..  :D|`|Vl7trXXraa	That's what i'm lead to beleive by my husband. Brianna always had a full head of hair but my husband wants to make her bald when she is 1. I'm not liking the idea at all but if it benefits her, then I guess it's ok.|`|d6Lpqz3Waa	just let it happen naturally if it is growing slow now then who knows how long it will take it to grow back after you shave it . but it is your child and you are  her mother so what ever you choose is whats best . but shaving her head bad idea !
hKJIDdVqaa	Kids are kids, they get tired, bored, aggravated, they cannot express themselves, lack impulse control and they need an outlet.  Crying and tantrums are what works and gets results  They are going to naturally 'want' stuff.  The stores know how to play off a child to sell a product.  What would you suggest a tired mom or dad after a long day at work and no money for a sitter do with their child while they grocery shop?  <br>  sighs....|`|cAtWxJG1aa	where do you suggest the kids go when a parent has to shop? i'm guessing they'd also be crying if you left them in a ditch somewhere.....|`|EtCRnDJMaa	maybe it's because the kid wants something like toy or junk food and we tell them NO then they start to cry.  Or maybe they want to get out of the cart and we tell them NO and they start to cry.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  next time im in the store i'll be sure to find you and get all 3 of mine screaming & crying just for you!<br>  <br>  who gives a $hit if they cry or not.   Maybe you can come watch mine while i go to the store because my husband is in Afghanistan right now busting his a$$ off working and can't make it home once a week for the store thing.....<br>  <br>  <br>  you're an idiot!|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	ohhhh!  i wasn't supposed to take them with me?  thats right i read that memo that said children should be seen and not heard and locked in closets until they are 18.  silly me.  i forgot.|`|SnQvsOPwaa	Only if you haven't trained them not to. You can't train them without bringing them in.|`|ed052b6f800dc43932558f491194a7b8aa	ok then what do we do with them?|`|ENANtueuaa	First of all, not every child acts up in the grocery store! Also, by not bringing them teaches the child that they can control what they want to do by having a tantrum..the child will begin to learn that if he doesn't want to be in the store, he can just throw a tantrum and mom will take him home, or stop bringing him. In reality, we cannot just hire a babysitter everytime we go to the store..they need to be taught not to throw tantrums instead. Makes more sense to me!|`|TBNaPkl6aa	I'll be honest with you - I used to think something very similar to you, and I used to get annoyed when I heard kids crying in a store.  Then I became a parent, and I realized I can't always leave my daughter home.  The errands have to get done some time, and I'd rather spend quality time in the evenings and on weekends with my husband and daughter, not doing errands.  Besides, if I didn't do the errands during the day, then look out, because society would label me as just another "lazy" stay-at-home mom who sits around all day eating bon-bons and watching soap operas.  <br>  <br>  Some day, when you have kids, you'll discover the following:<br>  -even the best behaved children lose it every once in a while;<br>  -you will feel lonely if you never venture out in public, with or without your child(ren);<br>  -you have to learn how to handle upset children in public, because you have to leave the house some time and most certainly can't leave small children home by themselves<br>  -you'll figure out what makes your kid tick, so you'll learn the best times of day to take your kids out to accompany you on errands, and finally;<br>  -if your kid acts up in public, you'll know how to take care of the situation, and yes, crying will be involved until you step in.  If the kid doesn't cooperate despite your best efforts, that's when you call it quits and head home.<br>  <br>  I realize it's frustrating to sit and listen to a kid cry in the store, especially when you don't think the parent is doing anything about it.  That's frustrating to me too.  But just remember that you don't know these people or their circumstances or what life is normally like for them, and that parenting is indeed the hardest job in the world.  You'll hear the kid cry for a few minutes of your life, but the mom and/or dad have to deal with the kids 24/7.  I thought I had all the answers before I became a parent, but being one is quite a humbling and rewarding experience.|`|MGOFjVnVaa	they are blackmailing us. they know they will get what they<br>  want if they cry loud enough.<br>  of course you should take our kinds along, never mind other<br>  people giving you queer looks or making nasty remarks, what<br>  bad mother or father you are.<br>  my reaction towards such people was - ok, take  the kid, calm<br>  him down! that always did the trick.<br>  you have to work on your resistance against childish blackmail.|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	ummmm right....where should we bring our kids then? it's about proper parenting not exclusion. the tantrum offers the opportunity to teach the child the right way to behave.  you can also teach your kids that you are going to get what you came for and nothing else ...simple as that.|`|q9BItD25aa	It can be very annoying listening to a kid scream in the store....but who can afford a babysitter just to go to the grocery store...that would add another 10.00 20.00 dolllars to the weekly bill. Yikes!! Maybe the grocery stores should have a holding pen for all the kiddies........|`|gJrHBtp1aa	so am I suppose to leave my 4 yr old and baby out in the car just so I can accomodate you? When I'm out shopping with my kids its because my husband isn't home to stay with them, Or else I would have left them at home.|`|IFDfpbFJaa	So what are we supposed to do? Avoid the grocery store completely as to not inconvenience people like yourself? Get over it......|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	if you dont like it ..leave. Welcome to society ..there are children here|`|axOJ2XUIaa	Just wait until you have your own kids and then you'll know the answer! Parents can't always control when the child will cry and busy mothers aren't going to hire a sitter just to go to the store, unless you want to pay for it?  I always took mine and we had fun, they'd get a balloon, and if they were extra good, they might get a small book.  Also the store has the items for the very young right where they can see them quite well.  The next time you're at the store notice where these items are.  Remember that the child is usually sitting in the shopping cart. You could ask the store to put the items somewhere else, because it is essentially their fault that the kids cry and want these items.|`|130816e5bf662924b68497e6577df429aa	OK, this is why people who don't have kids should not open their mouths about anything to do with parenting.<br>  <br>  First of all, no parent can tell when their child is going to cry. Secondly, if we want to actually feed our children, we have to go to the grocery store. We don't have the luxury of just dropping our kids off with someone whenever we need to run errands or go to the store. <br>  <br>  Maybe you should consider shopping online and having your groceries delivered if people with children bother you so much. <br>  <br>  Now, if you're referring to children who are throwing out-right temper tantrums because they're not getting something they want, then I agree that the parents should leave the store. If my 3 month old is crying, people can get over it if it bothers them. She's a baby, so she's going to cry sometimes. If my 4 year old is the one screaming and throwing a fit, I explain to her that she has to calm down because other people are trying to shop and don't want to hear her throwing a fit. If she continues, we go home. I want her to learn that she does not get what she wants by acting rude.|`|WQb5154Qaa	So how do you expect them to learn? Life experience is learning. Locking them up will not prepare them for the future.<br>  <br>  It sounds to me like Loretta C need to find a new job. I am sure the owner of the store where she works would rather have the people (spending money) in their store. The employee is much easier to replace. She should be thankful that she has a job. Beside work is WORK. It is not supposed to be fun and party. GROW UP!|`|GCPbKg9Eaa	of course you should bring them. Theya re part of the family and go on family outings.<br>  How will they learn how to behave in public if they never go out in public?<br>  You obviously have no children. If you do some day you will understand!|`|wUooHVU3aa	you don't seem to be in a very good mood today<br>  <br>  might try shopping after 10pm when all the parents are at home tucking their kids in, and you won't have to deal with us and our "crying" kids|`|28baa97a0d6383dd30466a3e19482da2aa	Well, if they are like me they don't have any other choice. We have to eat and it we don't go the the store we won't have food.|`|irLnPW4aaa	Parents bring their kids to the grocery store because they aren't legally allowed to leave the children at home alone.|`|DDFSITiYaa	Right, because we all have babysitters lined up and want to spend that time grocery shopping.|`|IfKTQME0aa	They do it on purpose to upset people who hate kids.  Its fun to watch all the people smirk at a crying child.|`|aiDV9FgGaa	What do you purpose the parents do with the children, since you know it all?|`|jjV0aikbaa	Get over it! If you don't like it leave.

S1gJJHNzaa	ok, so you are asking a group of women, like myself, desperate to get pregnant when ovulation will occur after an abortion?<br>  <br>  abortion is murder, sure hope there isn't another pregnancy or there will most likely be another murder.  if you can't handle the responsibility of pregnancy don't have sex.|`|IFDfpbFJaa	try just getting on the pill and preventing the problem to begin with.......I don't know your body, I can't tell you when you're going to have your next period. Sorry.|`|CKnHMYHnaa	What's up with saying 'immediate'?  <br>  Are you demanding that people answer you immediately? <br>  Is that the way life works for you?  You get pregnant and don't want to be so you immediately kill it?  You decide you want a baby now so you immediately want to ovulate? <br>  Grow up and recognize that life doesn't work on your schedule.<br>  <br>  EDIT.. and to ask this is TTC is beyond reprehensible!|`|NNwEuC8paa	Get a life. You are in a group where girls are trying like hell to get pregnant and you come in with an abortion question. get a heart and never have kids.

That being said, I would think those kinds of symptoms wouldn't come for a couple more months.  Either way, missing your period is the number one indicator so you want to make sure that way you can get to the doctor asap if you are pregnant.|`|wyAbkG3oaa	If you have missed your period then it is possible. You need to take a test to find out because if you are taking the pill, it can harm the baby. I do not know about the other syptoms you have though because I have never been pregnant but take a test and then you will know.|`|DedW7wG7aa	not necessarily it could be a pulse plus i dont think being pregnant gives your a needle sensation.<br>  <br>  i know your gunna get a load of people telling you to get a pregnancy test, but really thats the only way to know for real|`|xfxlpT2Waa	you could be im going through some of the same symptoms. go to th store and buy a test i have to to because im in the same situation but go to the store and get a test and go to the doctor.
Bw1h5xAcaa	It means you had a dream that you took a pregnancy test that came back positive. Dreams don't necessarily have to "mean" anything. Sometimes they are just random processing of thoughts. A dream means whatever you think it means.|`|MW1yrHbOaa	it's  just a dream but if you believe dreams have meanings then it is someone close to you that is pregnant. From what I've been told the person having the dream about pregnancy isn't the pregnant one. But who really knows anyway?|`|w6DJj1a8aa	that your pregnant!!!! well atleast for me cause everytime i have dreamt that i took a test or saw the baby before i even was pregnant i end up being pregnant and when i have my baby i'm like dang now i know what my dream was trying to say or what not you know!!!!!|`|7d84621e89c49bcba037226d3361c90baa	It could mean anything, or it could mean nothing.  It was a dream.  It could be that you either want to get pregnant, are scared you might be pregnant, or that you saw an ad for a pregnancy test on TV.|`|v3LnJycKaa	means you had this thought in your subconscious either about being or becoming pregnant, fears or what not... dreams are often manifestations of our subconcious thought process and nothing more.|`|8RfmosODaa	maybe yo wanna be pregnant|`|UxG6CkU2aa	I had a dream that I was at work and went to the restroom with a test and took it, and it was positive. So, the next day I had bought a test on my way to work and went to the bathroom and took it, and low and behold I was pregnant. It was crazy because I had no idea, it didn't even occur to me that it was a possibility.(I had been on the pill). With my next two children I didn't have any dreams though. Take a test if you think you may possibly be pregnant, so you can start taking good care of yourself!|`|edLbogmYaa	OK I am not an expert but... I think it means that you had a dream that you took a pregant test and it came out postive. Why are you trying to find hidden meanings in a silly dream? BTW maybe you should ask this question in the dream interpetation section..|`|5RvTXdmUaa	Maybe you want a baby. I'm 22 weeks pregnant and I had a dream that it was a girl. Im having a 3d ultrasound in 2 weeks so it'll be cool to find out if my dream was right :)|`|SqNoMz7vaa	That means that you keep on thinking about being pregnant, babies, etc. Seems to me that you are desperate to have a baby.|`|ejQ3yg9Naa	Maybe that subconsciously you want to be pregnant or think you are.

If she WAS fertile... all it takes is once.<br>  <br>  At this point, all she (and you) can do is wait and see if she gets her period.  If she doesn't, she'll need to test.|`|AA12041870	It only takes one time to get pregnant.  My advice to you is hope, pray, and if that doesn't work, get ready to be a daddy.|`|uFrqC4Y2aa	Most females don't throw up so soon. Everyone is different though. It only takes once though. I guess you are going to have to wait until the 8th to see if she gets her period or take a test.|`|tFoFchuEaa	On average there's about a 3% chance of getting your girlfriend pregnant for every time you have unprotected sex, or the condom breaks.|`|0dd7cabdea5b9d991d838d3e770488a1aa	You only had sex once, but it is SEVERAL MILLION SPERM!<br>  THere are a lot of ifs here, so NO promises.  <br>  If your gf has a 28 day cycle, and her period is due on March 8, then she would have ovulated on Feb 22.  <br>  If you had sex 3 weeks ago, on the 11th of Feb, and the sperm can live at the outside 7 days, that would mean that the last possible conception date after the sex would be the 18th of Feb, a few days before she actually ovulated.  You should be safe.  This time.<br>  This is all, of course, dependent upon whether she ovulated early or not, actually has a 28 day cycle, which is average, not normal, whether you are accurate in reporting, etc, etc, etc....<br>  <br>  Before you have sex again, please spend one entire day on the pregnancy and parenting board and just count the number of pregnancies that occur due to failed birth control.  I'll save you the trouble and tell you that it happens ALL the time.<br>  <br>  Besides the obvious getting pregnant and how that would affect you and her, and all the decisions you would have to make - NONE of which have a good answer.  You will also be affecting the upbringing of your first child, and your parents (and her parents) first grandchildren.  You may have noticed that a lot of people are very attached to their grandchildren, and you, son, are not an island unto yourself.  Your actions affect other people's lives and hearts a great deal.<br>  <br>  A MAN doesn't just go around having sex willy-nilly.  A MAN thinks about what he wants his own future to be like, and the future of his children, then makes decisions about how to bring that about, and follows through on his actions.<br>  <br>  So, if, right now, you want your first child's future to be in someone else's hands, aborted without any say so on your part, or raised apart from you and without your intervention (though believe me, you'd have to pay for it to be raised), then by all means, continue having sex, protected or otherwise.<br>  <br>  See, as an unmarried man, you have lost all rights to your children, and the truth is, you don't know what she'd do if she got pregnant.  Maybe she'd marry you, maybe not.  Maybe she'd have an abortion, maybe not.  Maybe she'd give it up for adoption, maybe not.  Maybe she'd keep it and raise it well, maybe not.  Maybe you'd get visitation "rights", maybe not.  Maybe she'd come after you for child support, maybe not.  One thing is for sure, NONE of those decisions will have anything to do with what you want.  Do you REALLY want that much of your future to be in someone else's hands?  (Well, DO YOU, punk?).<br>  Sex is fun, and babies are great.  Always wondering what your child would have been like if she aborted it, or wondering who is raising him if it's adopted out, or whether she's doing a good job, or wishing you could be part of his life, and dealing with the grief your parents will experience as they watch their dreams for their first grandchild go up in a puff of smoke, and the dreams you had for your own future, while continuing to pay a few hundred dollars per month in child support as your obligation to the child you created but never get to see is a very high price to pay for a few minutes of pleasure.|`|5RvTXdmUaa	She probably wasn't ovulating, sounds like it was too soon for that. You'll just have to wait until the 8th though. Good luck. Maybe she should go on the pill also if you guys aren't ready for a baby.|`|dRo89MsYaa	yes, it is possible that she's pregnant. buy an HPT at walmart or the drug store. :) If she is, good luck to both of you.|`|N6XTcGejaa	she has all the chance sof getting pregnant.|`|BO28Mn8haa	wait until the 8th buddy. if no period, start testing.|`|1os95dHZaa	If you are underage you cannot get a girl pregmant!|`|qNVP4Q1Saa	Good luck with that....|`|EtDGRJPSaa	mye bi|`|Czpfs8RLaa	um hello has no one heard of the morning after pill?|`|opQbQVreaa	Well it only takes once to get pregnant.<br>  There are only 3-4 days in a cycle when a woman is fertile. <br>  Just b/c she threw up does not mean that she has concieved, especially if she just threw up once.

If she was pregnant she would probably be feeling pretty ill allot more than just one time. I would wait till the 8th . No sense getting worked up about it before hand. In any case , abstinence insures you would not have to go through this stress again but if u insist then use something along with the condom or the morning after pill if it ever happens again. If she's prego then I would suggest not to be a coward about it like allot of men these days. It's partly your responsibility.|`|vXlrA4oMaa	As for the first part of your question, there is roughly a 87.65 percent chance she is pregnant (source: NAACP)<br>  <br>  As for the vomiting, had she eaten at Arbys shortly before getting sick.

If she is due to have her period March 8th and you had sex approximately 3 weeks ago, according to the ovulation schedule it might be okay.  Ask her if her cycle is a 28 day cycle or what.  If she has the first day of her period 28 days after the last period's first day then she is on a 28 day cycle so therefore,  ovulation is likely to begin about 14 days after the day her last period BEGAN.  So if her last period began on February 8th then.....February 22 would be the next ovulation date.   And with sperm being able to survive 3 to 5 days, even if you have sex a day or two before her ovulation starts, there could be a chance for fertilization.  An egg can be fertilized within the first 24 hours after it is released into the fallopian tubes (onset of ovulation).   Unless your girlfriend's periods are not regular, I don't think she had ovulated yet 3 weeks ago.  <br>  If she is on a 28 day schedule then she would be ovulating within a couple days of when she was feeling sick and throwing up.  Therefore it would have been well after your "encounter" with her 3 weeks ago. <br>   <br>    <br>  Although, I read on MayoClinic.com that some women can experience morning sickness as soon as 2 weeks after conception, I doubt that her throwing up only 2 weeks after you had sex had much to do with a pregnancy. <br>  She could just have a stomach bug so don't freak until March 10th or 11th. <br>  Since she knows she is due to have her period on March 8th, she must know how long her cycle is.  She would know if it was 28 days or more.  Even if it was a 30 or 31 day cycle, I think you might still be safe.  <br>  I know it's hard to wait and see but try not to stress after she has missed her period and I'd still give it a day or two after that and then get a test.  If she is stressed about whether she is pregnant or not, it could affect when she starts.   Hope this helped.  Good luck and both of you need to try to relax until you after her period due date has come and gone and you find out for sure.  <br>  If an unexpected surprise is in store for you two, there are always people there to help.  Don't be affraid to go to your parents first.
H0fXySX9aa	im in the uk and they wont even listen for a heart beat until 16 weeks by doppler<br>  its ok hun so don't worry|`|IFDfpbFJaa	My doc let me see the baby's heart beat and told me I wouldn't be able to hear it yet. at 6.5 weeks. I wonder why your doc would try to hear it....that's weird, she should know better than that. They told me as my next appointment that i should be able to hear it and that was at 10 weeks.|`|v3LnJycKaa	was the dr able to measure the size of the gestational sack and tell you approximately how far along you are, I believe at about 6 1/2 to 7 weeks you can view the hart beat on ultrasound, ocasionally before and ocassionally after, your dates may be skewed due tot he IUD,I would try to wait those two weeks, and ask int he mean time if your dr wouldnt mind performing a blood test for HCG then another in 48-96 hours to confirm levels are elvating normally.... bestof luck to you! <br>  <br>  PS to all those who said you cant find a heart beat before 12 weeks, I am assumingyou mean via doppler, well with this baby I heard the doppler heartbeat clear as day at 8w.... :)|`|NDQS5HJyaa	Yeah, its normal... most of the time, anyway. Yeah, there are instances where there might be a problem, especially considering you had an IUD in... but just hope for the best. Especially because you're still so early on in pregnancy, it might be difficult to find anything, but its there--just vaguely, more than likely. It also depends on the doppler or whatever the name of the machine it is they use to find the heart beat, older models have a more difficult time finding things like that. I wouldn't worry too much about it. :)|`|uFrqC4Y2aa	You usually can't HEAR the heartbeat at 6-7 weeks. But you can SEE it in an ultrasound. If you are feeling uncertain you can get an ultrasound done, or wait a few more weeks until the heartbeat is strong enough to hear with a doppler. You can even rent a doppler for about $25/month online and have it mailed to you. A lot of hospitals rent them as well.|`|Bw1h5xAcaa	In most cases, if dating is correct, a heartbeat should be visible by ultrasound by 6.5 weeks at the very latest. So yes, if your dates are correct, you could possibly be miscarrying. They should do a repeat scan to confirm in another week.<br>  <br>  Best of luck.|`|zSABr7praa	I'm sorry your doctor sent you out the door with such a scare.  This happened to me, except my doctor sent me out the door with a smile and said "come back at 8 weeks, we'll try again!"  He said it's VERY common not to hear the heartbeat until 8-10 weeks.  Don't worry!|`|mbGOEZSAaa	I think if she really thought that something was wrong with the pregnancy she would have done an ultrasound or something. Most doctors won't even try to listen until 10 weeks because they may not hear anything and don't want you to worry. You probably won't hear it until you are 10-12weeks along.|`|0CGRQd0Raa	Hi, with ultrasound around 6-7 weeks but 8-9 weeks is also okay. According to Mayoclinic fetus heart starts beating around 5 weeks. see <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/prenatal-care/PR00112" rel="nofollow">http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/prenata...</a> .<br>  I strongly hope that you will be able to hear your baby's heart beat on your next visit to the doctor. :)|`|dRo89MsYaa	normally you don't hear the heartbeat until the 12th week or so. :) so don't worry if you don't hear it before then. :)|`|1os95dHZaa	You should have seen a flutter, not hearing anything at this point is not uncommon.|`|8mchLCQhaa	I saw the heart beat at 6 weeks but could not hear it yet!|`|NZid2d1Paa	Well I went in for my ultrasound at 6 weeks and it was harder to find a heart beat, but they looked for a while a finally found it. You are so early on in your pregnancy that everything is harder to find, if you do wait 1 week you will probably hear it, its hard to tell how far a long you are, you might be a week early then you think. when i went in thinking i was 7 weeks, they told me i was 6 weeks. so you never know. I think you are fine, doctors seem to make it sound worse then it is. Good luck and hope everything is fine.|`|mf3OOagMaa	Maybe you have the wrong doctor???? They should have reassured you, not worried you. An ultrasound would have provided instant answers if there were concerns....even if you couldn't hear the heartbeat (maybe an organ was in the way or your bladder was full or your docs hearing is gone) an ultrasound would have shown a fluttering heart, which would have provided reasurance weather you can "hear" the heart beat or not. Get a new doc - you have a long time to go and you don't need anymore "scares". Worse case scenario - an ultrasound would have confirmed that your baby was in the womb and not in a tube (a tubal pregnancy) - a situation that could have been dangerous for both you and your baby!  What I am getting at is: if the heartbeat wasn't where it should have been - your doc should have checked "why", not made you worry for two weeks until he "waited" it out. The stress alone from worrying could have made you lose the baby! During this two week wait it out stage - did he at least have you go for blood tests so that he could monitor your hormone levels - so that he knew if the baby was developing or not? If not - GET A NEW DOCTOR, immediately. Don't worry about his feelings - worry about yours.|`|Tj5WkS6haa	A heartbeat may not be visible that early until 8 weeks on the ultrasound.  If you were using a fetal doppler usually you can't hear until 12 weeks.  If your very skinny maybe earlier.
wiAVa1H5aa	It's a form of discipline in the way we define discipline, it incorporates internal discipline in the child.   However, it is not a form of punishment or correction.|`|eu6UQElYaa	All discipline really means is to instruct someone to follow a certain behavior pattern or order.   So any form of behavior instruction is technically a form of discipline, that includes positive reinforcement.|`|4lHJEq5Haa	silly, isn't it? they think that if they try to candycoat the discipline, they won't scar their kid for life. hello, that's still a weak form of discipline.<br>  <br>  These are usually the parents whose kids tell them to "shut up and give me the car keys" when they get older.|`|prqrQcd1aa	YES... and these are the people that don't know what "discipline" actually means.. Not me, I know that it is!|`|0QYIbn1saa	Yeah, WTF?|`|LwbwMFX9aa	it depends. sometimes kids need a good whack on the butt, time out or scolding to learn, it depends on the child and sitaution|`|JT4OSUPeaa	Around here they do.<br>  <br>  I sure don't.|`|vcxdTXbraa	I think it depends on how the child responds|`|yo9XNz61aa	All I can do is tell ya what I believe....reward good behavior even if its just a good job or pat on the back...show no attention to bad behavior.  I do think time outs are good but I believe when a child gets out of time out you show no attention to it and simply keep putting them back until the time out is over!  I really like the discipline topics even though my daughter is not old enough for any of that.  Im going to raise my child as I please just like everyone else will do as they please with theirs but I always like creative and fun ideas to teach my child for when shes older!  Im not really the spanking type so it will always be used as a very very last resort....hopefully never!|`|29I3YjjPaa	Unfortunately yes this is true...people look as discipline as a negative...so if they use positive reinforcement there just lying to themselves and sugar coating it to seem as though there not disciplining its a bunch of bull if u ask me!|`|doha66YWaa	When I was a little kid (bearing in mind that I was a goody-two-shoes of a kid) all I wanted to do was please grownups.<br>  If theyd told me I was doing things right a bit more often I might have a shred of self esteem now.|`|axOJ2XUIaa	Yes, sadly, they think rewarding good behavior spoils the child.|`|cAtWxJG1aa	apparently.  ;-)<br>  <br>  not me, though.|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	Some people think that the words 'discipline' means 'punish'.|`|hKJIDdVqaa	sure it is.  I think sending a child to there room for grounding, or hitting, is not discipline.  How can a child do right, if they have no idea what they are doing is wrong.   Proper discipline in my eyes has nothing to do with abuse or restriction.|`|lkhCeAdJaa	I saw the hater-girl on Des's question.  That one REEKS of jealousy.<br>  Positive reinforcement IS discipline....at it's best!|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	according to answers i am the worst parent in the world.  i would like my trophy please.|`|41980ab28e587a42197eea5a921bca4aaa	Yeah, some people don't think so.  I think that 100% it is.
s4LWmcTjaa	I try not to compare my kids to other kids, but I do.... it's human of me :)<br>  <br>  I honestly have to say that they are on the average scale for their age group but are very well behaved.  They both have their moments.  <br>  <br>  I'm not saying that because I'm biased (ok well I'm a little biased, obviously) but my parents, my in-laws, complete strangers and everyone in between have told me how well mannered and sweet my kids are.  The church nursery loves our kids.  They call them (and I quote) "little delights!".<br>  <br>  <br>  I really enjoy Carrie's view point.  That makes sense.|`|60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	All of ours are in that better category, right?  ; ) <br>  I get compliments on behavior from daycare workers and complete strangers on a very regular basis so I must not be doing too bad.  There is *always* room for improvement.|`|hKJIDdVqaa	My oldest son, is better behaved, a top striver, extremely self motivated, high honor student and responsible., my second son is your typical 9 year old, but has a great attitude for life.  My daughter is very well behaved but I think a typical tomboy.|`|4gZYucHMaa	My kids are super good, meaning I have no idea how the heck they are.. I get compliments all the time on them and I'm flattered but I think constantly, it's nothing to do with me. If they were like me, I'd be in trouble!|`|AA11210211	My son is better behaved then most children I see in public but my daughter is only 1 yr so I don't really except much from her.|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	Definitely better...   and I spend a lot of time with other people's children, volunteering at the school, in scouts, etc.|`|s6emVQleaa	I actually think there are a lot better behaved children than my daughter.  She's going to be a strong willed one and keeping her under control is a battle.  I do my best, but I see plenty of kids my daughters age who don't run around like a crazy monkey like she does.  However, it just means that I am going to have to be incredibly more patient in how we go about creating a well behaved child and I am up for the battle.|`|eu6UQElYaa	If I'm going to throw in my bias, then obviously my children are so much better behaved than everyone else's.<br>  <br>  In reality though they are about average.  Sometimes they are very well behaved.  Sometimes they are wreaking havoc.   Most of the time they are somewhere in the middle.|`|flqAr30laa	i give mine an A-<br>  she still needs a little work and i have to remind her sometimes.<br>  <br>  Lets just say she is shocked at the behavior of the kids on supernanny show.|`|lkhCeAdJaa	If we all claim our children are 'better behaved than average', doesn't that raise the bar a little higher?  And if the bar is raised, are they still better?  I don't know how to answer;-)|`|j2mRop0laa	Mine are terrific. I get complimented on them very often in public. <br>  They are better. :)<br>  <br>  BUT, at home... they have their moments. I still wouldn't trade em for the world. hehe|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	greetings from lake wobegon!|`|dPULl5hjaa	Our 2 teens 13 & 16 are better behaved, have morals and are 5,000% better than others!<br>  <br>  They get compliments from people!|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	my children are perfect specimens and anyone should be so lucky to have them.  it comes from their mother ;-)|`|p07RwZK2aa	My twin girls are 6. One is loud and confident, and perhaps a bit cheeky. The other is more shy and nervy, but they are both quite well-behaved, though perhaps the former is a little too chatty at school. <br>  <br>  My four year old son is very energetic and excitable but quite a Mommy's boy and also well-behaved. <br>  <br>  My 3 month old daughter is the best of the lot! Haha. She hardly cries at all... touch wood. <br>  <br>  Overall my kids are well-behaved, only a little excitable.|`|LwbwMFX9aa	better than most<br>  one time at a restuarant the waitress came by and said I just wanted to say how great it is serving your family, your kids are so well behaved, most people who bring their kids in here let them run wild. <br>  <br>  Man I never felt so good in my life,lol|`|prqrQcd1aa	My oldest has been acting pretty average lately. <br>  My other two are pretty much better behaved than other children that i see out and about that are the same ages as them.|`|VuUz8NgKaa	I would say she is average, she has her moments, but other times she is very well behaved. I know my daughter is no angel but she isn't a little demon either.
MxhNzW7Oaa	I am one of your statistics!<br>  <br>  I like to have baby's head rest in the crease of my left elbow. <br>  <br>  I am right-handed.<br>  <br>  ETA: I should add that if I al sitting on the end of the couch, I prefer to lay the baby's head on which ever end I was sitting at. If I was sitting on the right side, I'd lay the baby on the right side so I have the arm of the couch as support. & Visa versa|`|IFDfpbFJaa	I'm left handed.

I know I am weird!|`|qJBMdL7gaa	I am right handed, so I always laid the baby on my left arm so I could hold his bottle with my right hand...well, after months of doing this, he developed a flat spot on the side of his head from me always laying him only on the one side...so the Dr suggested I switch arms every feeding! Hope this helps!! And his flat spot did go away :)|`|AA11109728	I do all that stuff with my left, and I'm right handed.

I drive left handed too.|`|aUKa1rzhaa	I am right handed and my babies heads have always been on my left arm.  My husband is also right handed,  but prefers her head to rest on his right arm..??

xApAWlshaa	There is no difference lets just all get that straight its hitting.regardless of where its done.|`|ovxQ8HLuaa	the difference is that a child needs disciplined... smacking the hand teaches them that they cannot just grab things whenever they want ... keeping them away from outlets (like my toddlers always go for)....a child uses their hands when picking up something (or sticking things in outlets!!).. they dont use their bottoms... when you smack a childs hand they learn that they cannot use their hands to put objects into outlets.... i think that smacking a hand should be the last resort but when you have a child who continues to do the "no no's" even after time outs and such, they have to learn somehow.. like in my case, the outlet thing..my daughter ALWAYS messed with the outlet. i finally smacked her hand because she wouldnt leave it alone (mind you this was after time outs and distracting her with something else)...now she doesnt bother it anymore.. im sorry, but i'd rather smack my childs hand than to have her die from getting electricuted<br>  <br>  Uhm YES I have heard of outlet protectors. But how the hell am I supposed to put them into an outlet whenever I have something plugged into it???? I have protectors on my unused outlets. I am talking about things that are plugged in.. like my lamps for example.|`|axOJ2XUIaa	Hitting is hitting.  But only smack a hand if the child is reaching for something dangerous as a light socket or something.  Then you are saving a life.  Otherwise, refrain.  I know it is hard when you are mad.  Just go in your room, shut the door and count to 10 -- it works wonders for the temper!|`|60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	I would love to know<br>  <br>  ETA:  I had a son w/ an electrical outlet fascination too.  There are other ways.  I'm not trying to criticize you, just sayin' that those are not the only 2 options.|`|cAtWxJG1aa	yeah, i had the same reaction.  face, hand, bottom ... i really don't see a difference.|`|145RUNQHaa	Why would anyone think the best option for a child who is reaching out to an electrical outlet would be to smack their hand?i find that very odd surely the best option is to hold their hands away or pick them up and remove them doesn't that make more sense?it's like when i hear people say a smack saves a life when a child runs in front of a car.i think the child would be run over while you wasted your time trying to smack them.if my child did that i would be concentrating on picking them up and pulling them to safety.like you say electrical sockets should be covered and you should be on the ball to re direct from danger same with running into a road.a child really should be holding an adults hand while near a busy road.no smack necessary.it's much better and more sensible to take the time to teach instead of reacting to a knee jerk reaction.|`|AA12190953	No difference you are teaching a child it is ok to hit other people.<br>  Outlet protectors are what go over electrical plugs to deter a child from placing a foreign object in them so they dont get hurt.|`|eu6UQElYaa	The difference, one smack is on the hand and the other smack lands on the rear end.  Other than that the differences are just made up in the mind of those dishing out the hitting.|`|AA12145826	Other then location, I'm not sure what the difference is. Maybe some people are uncomfortable with touching their child's bottom so they prefer the hand, who knows?
7rCeCVl2aa	I breast fed my children for a week before I started pumping for another 2-3 weeks. I have a pituitary gland tumor and it inhibits my milk production. <br>  <br>  So basically I gave them as much as I possibly could before I dried up to a drip and then I switched to formula.|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	At 3-4 months your child should be getting either breastmilk or formula, not milk. They shouldn't have that until their around a year old, because they're systems are not ready for it yet and it can cause allergic reactions. With solids, some introduce them at 3-4 months but most doctors recommend waiting until 6 months. <br>  <br>  I nursed my children past age one because I wanted to, and so did they. Even after they were on solids and cow's milk, they still got comfort from nursing when sick or for bedtime and naptime.|`|ccd9bacbf1ad616406e98ebf61adc6dcaa	I was originally planning to nurse for at least the first year, and then pumping so I could give it to her in a cup. I wanted her to have the best start in life, and a year is really not a big sacrifice. Unfortunately, when she was 6 weeks old, I broke a tooth and it got badly infected. The breast friendly medications weren't working, so I had no choice but to turn to formula. I even tried to pump and dump so I could resume nursing later, but the meds obliterated my supply. She's taken well to the formula, but I totally miss the bond we had while breastfeeding. So if you're able to nurse, try to go as long as possible.|`|ROJans2Taa	well I breastfed my first till 2 1/2 mths, then I freaked one day when she wouldn't stop screaming and thought she wasn't getting enough and started a bottle I was uneducated in the matter and young, my second I was determined to at least go to 6 mths, but had real bad latching problems and he wasn't gaining back his weight and then I started supplementing and things got out of control and now he's on just formula at 6 mths, I would have loved to breastfeed exclusively till even 8 mths, I think it's wonderful but im not into judging others, the only time I would is when you have a 3+ year old breastfeeding im sorry if it offends people but it creeps me out. I see it unnecessary, but each to their own|`|AA12193113	3-4 months is NOT old enough to eat "normal" milk or foods.  If you stop breastfeeding, the baby will have to drink formula.  If your going to breastfeed, good for you. I hope you have a good experience with it.  I am a mother to a 8 month old son and he has been breastfeed exclusively since day one.  I plan on breastfeeding until he is at least 18 months old.|`|vue9NOhYaa	I would encourage you to do a bit of research.  There is nothing abnormal about breastfeeding a baby who 'can' drink milk.  And really, a 4 month old CAN'T drink milk or eat 'normal food.'  A 4 month old, if not breastfed, requires formula (milk specially modified so that it resembles breastmilk) and, if he can eat solids at all, they need to be pureed and fed with a spoon.  Those solids don't meet the nutritional needs of a young baby, and are purely for fun until baby is close to a year.<br>  <br>  <br>  There is NO medical/nutritional justification for weaning a baby that age.  EVERY medical and nutritional organization recommends breastfeeding (if possible) for at least a year.  (At which point baby CAN be weaned to regular milk and 'normal food.) <br>  <br>  I had plannned to breastfeed for a year, but ended up going for about 14 months.  <br>  <br>  Your baby, your choice, but please make it an educated choice.|`|T0gv52CDaa	I nursed my first son until he was 13 months, and I plan to nurse my now 4 month old until he is at least a year.  I do so because it is important to me to give them the healthiest thing for them.  Babies can't have anything other than breast milk or formula until they are at least 4 months, and even at that age, their primary nutrients should still be coming from breast milk or formula with small amounts of cereal or baby food just to get them used to the texture.  As for giving them cow's milk, they can't have that (or any other dairy product) until they are at least one year old.  By the time they are one year old, table food is where they should be getting most of their nutrition from, but even then if they are still going to be drinking milk at all, breast milk is better for them and easier to digest than cows milk is.<br>  <br>  If you just don't like breastfeeding, then you should quit and switch to formula.  I know that breastfeeding is harder for some women than it has been for me, and even 3-4 months is better than not at all. Just don't give your child cows milk at 3 or 4 months old.<br>  <br>  As for what is normal, that varies from society to society.  I took an anthropology class when I was in college and studied a group where breastfeeding until your child was 5 was the norm.  That is a bit much for me, but I don't think there is anything wrong with it.|`|qFmOuXMXaa	I thought I would only want to breastfeed till she was 6 months old and now that she is 6 months I think I will keep going.My baby is not on any soilds yet and eats every 3-4 hours and weighs 15lbs. No reason not to......at first breastfeeding is not easy and you think that is all you are doing some times every hour on the hour but believe me when I say it gets SOOOOOOOOOOO much easier and around the time you want to stop.lol<br>    What I did was I started giving my baby a bottle at 5 months once a day and still do now, just so when I may feel like breastfeeding or you want Dad to feed baby he can or if you just want to get out of the house for more then 3 hours you can without baby, you can. It works great.<br>    Stop when you feel is right but really give the old collage try, good luck.|`|AA11476782	That's great that you plan to breastfeed, but your reason for stopping around 3-4 months is silly.  For one, a child *can* eat baby food at 4 months, but it's not recommended till 6 months, to my knowledge.  Also, breastmilk doesn't stop being beneficial at the time when they can have food or milk (which, by the way, is at one year).  I am planning to continue nursing until my baby is at least one year old, at which time she could drink whole milk, possibly longer.|`|aWkp6AJOaa	i will probably breastfeed until 1yr.  some people like to do it until 2 or longer.  it's better than formula & you can still do it without introducing food.  we just started rice cereal & she is almost 5mths.  you do what you feel though & don't let anyone make you feel inadequate for doing something other than breastfeeding.|`|UXoTCL98aa	well you should never give children regular cows milk before the age of one.<br>  I've been reading up on it and it is actually proven to be linked to diseases later on in life like cardiovascular disease etc, and diabetes in children, or even overweight children.|`|OzM5P1TIaa	first of all congratulation on safe birth of ur child.its v nice if u feed ur child for two years.its better for better health of u and child.mother milk save child from many deseases and also save mother from breast problems.so keep on feeding ur child for more ime.best of luck.|`|oA8Rtyxuaa	Even when a child starts eating "normal" food (cereal around 4 months and jarred baby food around 6 months) they still need milk weather it be breast milk or formula. I breastfed my daughter until she was 13 month old.|`|DNygQdmVaa	I breastfef until my son was 2 months, I wanted to until he was around 6 months, but I couldnt any longer due to medical reasons.|`|0VUZacRTaa	I plan on breast feeding my daughter until shes at least a year old(not exclusively). It is VERY healthy for her. I plan on breast feeding, giving baby cereal mixed with my milk here soon, and giving her solids some when able to. I just think the longer the better. Im not going to continue for years and years or anything, but as long as I can I plan on it. There is nothing better for her.|`|sfn7RP1yaa	it is very normal to breast feed even when the baby can eat solids. Its just natural to breast feed your baby for as long as you can.And it has so many more vitamins then formula or solids. I breastfed my son for 15 months and im glad i did. Hes now 4 and very healthy.|`|JqvfrLTbaa	Your going to be a Mum .. oh my gosh looking at your answers to people questions you sound way to immature !<br>  <br>  I am you only have to see the answer to the question you gave in the link|`|115I5Polaa	I only got to breastfeed for 3 weeks before my milk dried up, but I did have enough in the freezer to last another 3 or 4 weeks.  I really wanted to breastfeed until she was 1, but that didn't happen.  Good luck!
DDFSITiYaa	Hmm I have to try to express my answer to this carefully because not one of you know me. <br>  <br>    I love my kids to the nth degree and feel that I am raising awesome people.  Some of that I can take credit for and some of it is just discovery of who they are. <br>  <br>  <br>  However, it is not the single life or childless life I miss.  I miss not having to worry all the time about if I am doing ok and what I may be doing that they will remember.  I don't like to watch the news anymore because stories about child abduction, teen drinking, bullying etc just give me more things to worry about.  I worry about how the world will be in 10, 15 years when my kids head off to college.  I worry about how they will find a mate, about their happiness, their future.  I worry that I will die before I see them in comfortable happy lives.  <br>  <br>  I understand there is much joy brought to my life and to the world because of them.  There are such sweet moments in my life that I tear up just thinking of them.  But the worrying, I could do without.|`|AA10226047	You know the best part about being a mom, when your oldest is in college getting ready to graduate and your other two are about a year or two from starting.  Watching her walk across that stage will probably be my proudest moment of being a mom.  I loved them when they were little (before they start the back talking and sneaking out at night) but once they got older it felt kind of nice to leave them at home for a little while ( ages 15 and 17) and go off by myself.|`|lYZ71zYAaa	Mine are grown, married with children of their own, I would have never changed a thing, Wait until you get grandchildren, It is wonderful, and it starts all over again,this time you can say good bye see you later, and go about your life. You still worry about them but mom and dad have most of the worries.|`|7ee2e58a43d3c7214fd3e8cb1f2c131eaa	Yes it is a wonderful feeling to be a mommy.One of the best things that has ever happened to me..Occasionally,I look back to pre-baby days but the only thing I miss is the occasional break or extra money,nothing worth going back for..I wouldn't change it for a second.My life is so much more full now that it ever was before..|`|7rIAd6gGaa	I wouldn't give it up for anything. It is without a doubt the hardest thing I've ever done, but also the most rewarding by a long shot. I feel like it's the reason I am here. I know that sounds really corny, but it's true. I feel like my life actually has a real purpose now. :)|`|0QYIbn1saa	I've always known that being a mom is the best job out there for me....my dream came true 16-months ago....lovin every minute of it :)|`|gDrLtqOIaa	i dont know how does a mother feel.but when i get a mommy i will take care my daghter to be happy|`|FTwYckN2aa	My newborn is 3 weeks old. I have sleepless nights and sleepless days. Every time I sleep he wakes up. It's definitely tiring but I love him. Especially since I'm exclusively breastfeeding. (I'm extremely proud of myself for that.. I didn't think I'd last this long) I love being his mom. It's such a fulfilling experience. He loves and appreciates me. It's wonderful. Even when it's the middle of the night and all I've slept is an hour I drag myself out of bed.. but once I see his face I'm just so in-love and it's worth it. I love being a mom.|`|M9mjCEQpaa	Yes it is the best!  It is so rewarding and I just love the love that my children show me.  It is great to come home to a bunch of smiling faces that love you no matter your faults or flaws.  The other day I was angry and hurt and upset and crying because my husband and I were disagreeing with another adult who was acting very childish.  I tried to hide it from the kids, but my 19 month old could see the hurt in my eyes and the pain and she came and sat on my lap and she grabbed my chin to make me look her in the eyes and she kissed me.  She smiled and giggled and then put her head down on my shoulder and right then and there everything that was going on in the world didn't seem to matter to me any more!  God has blessed me with 3 beautiful children and a wonderful husband that helps me all the time with them.  I am so thankful and so blessed and it is really the best to be a mommy.|`|ZYlr9TSBaa	Being a mummy is the best thing that's ever happened to me. Nothing that can happen in my life will ever compare to that feeling of knowing you're the most important person to such a small little being.|`|pXSKSS3daa	I love being my son's mommy. All I need to do is look at him to know I'm doing a darn good job and it's so rewarding seeing this little person develop and grow, knowing he counts on us for everything and that we are providing.<br>  <br>  I'll be honest, though, I do miss pre-baby days. Especially being able to pick up and go without worrying about Noah's routine. I mean, our life isn't structured around him but it's easier to go out after a nap and feeding time.|`|8RfmosODaa	Yes it is the best feeling, from conception, to the baby belly to birth to then growing up. Each stage and phase is wonderful!|`|nmu6coapaa	Being a mum has made my life meaningful! I dont know how anything ever made me happy before! He really is my sunshine!|`|CVdcrY3kaa	Being a mom is more than I could ever ask for. I can't express how much I love it.|`|ccd9bacbf1ad616406e98ebf61adc6dcaa	It is the best thing I ever did in my life.|`|SaRDq9iLaa	Being a mommy is the best thing in the world.  My mom asked me the other day if I felt like I've always had Brianna.  I told her that I can't imagine my life without my daughter in it.  It doesn't matter if she wakes up during the night or early in the morning and if she has an off day- I love every second of every day with her!|`|7d84621e89c49bcba037226d3361c90baa	Absolutely.  There is nothing in the world to compare to the depths of feeling I've had since becoming a mother.  I can't even remember what it felt like not to be a mother.|`|EmYNUZcXaa	i love being a mother!! its the hardest, but most enjoyable and self rewarding responsibility i have ever had!! i wouldn't change it for the world. she means everything to me!|`|DNygQdmVaa	Sometimes I wish i could go out and do no children stuff, but Im very happy with my 3 kids.<br>  <br>  I feel so exhausted at the end of the day though.|`|AA11476782	Absolutely, without a doubt.  I have never wanted to go back to life before she came along.  She has given love a whole new meaning.|`|AA12251362	I agree 100000000%.....I could never imagine my life without my daughter right now. It's the most amazing thing watching a child grow up and it happens SO fast!|`|QCVzUC1baa	I never knew it would be such a hard job but I LOVE IT!<br>  <br>  I do my best for my son and always will.|`|gJlxZdL5aa	I don't have a baby yet but I know before you have a child you think having a baby will be a wonderful thing.....<br>  <br>  But if you ask my mother.....I ruined her life.   Its my fault she isn't where she wants to be and doing what she wants to do.  So for her no she would have rather had a glamorous career.<br>  <br>  She does look forward to having my sister out of the house though (i am already grown and gone) because then she can do what she "Really Wants to do with her life"<br>  <br>  (She got pregnant with me when she was 20 years old and unmarried, she enjoys being a mom to my sister more but that is because she is kind of living through her.....my sister dances and sings)<br>  <br>  But I think it will be a wonderful thing (my kid will planned)<br>  <br>  The difference in my mothers relationship with me and the one with my sister was my sister was planned
RwoN3E9Uaa	Only at nap and bedtime.  Every now and again she'll want to nurse just until letdown and then decides to stop (drives me crazy!). Other times she is way to busy and distracted to want to even eat for more than 5 minutes at a time.  Is it possible she is a little under the weather or has a tooth coming in?  Elyse always nurses more frequently when she is teething.|`|qFmOuXMXaa	So far she has never comfort nurse but she is almost 6 months old and I feed her every 3-4 hours, and she is on no solids as of yet. I hope she doesn't start.lol|`|T0gv52CDaa	If I let him, my son would just stay attached to a breast permanently.  I don't know how much of that is my fault though because when he is upset, and I can't figure out what is going on, I just find that popping a breast in his mouth is the fastest way to settle him, and I don't mind, so I do it.|`|LhV8D2Xeaa	OMG!! i know how you feel my son wanted to comfort nurse about every hour. Try to distract her if she isnt already screaming her head off. And if your not already then start on some baby foods.|`|bf6fb0f4caadf24cfa826edc2cc32d3baa	My son wants to anytime he is sleepy
cAtWxJG1aa	lol on the question, the example, and the suggested category.<br>  <br>  sorry, i just can't talk about toilets today because i spent too much time yesterday cleaning up the flood following my 3-year-old's proud announcement that he used the potty himself and took care of his own toilet paper (the entire roll).|`|j2mRop0laa	Omg.. this brought back memories.<br>  <br>  Daddy took the girls fishing a few years back. It was my youngest daughters first time.<br>  <br>  a couple days later I found her in the bathroom holding the fishing pole in the toilet. I said "What are you doing?" She just shrugged and said, "Fishin" <br>  <br>  ha ha|`|YuVSDBkzaa	When my daughter was about 2 1/2, she would discard anything she didn't like into the toilet. I've found bottles, old toys, etc. Fortunately, she doesn't do it anymore.|`|s4LWmcTjaa	My son.<br>  <br>  Seriously, he climbed in there about a year and a half ago and was just standing there smiling away!  Oh I flipped!  I think I washed him about 5 times that day, lol.|`|AA11210211	my flip flops and my phone.After he threw my phone in the toilet I locked the bathroom door so he couldn't get in.|`|MxhNzW7Oaa	I had to fish my cell phone out of it last week :(<br>  <br>  Needless to say I had to buy another one.<br>  <br>  ETA: I should add that it was me who dropped it in there, not my boys! I think the worst Tyler has thrown in is the toothbrush. But he knows he's not allowed to play in the bathroom and the door has to stay shut. My cat escapes outside through the small hole underneath our water tank in the wall (I live in a trailer ATM).|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	OMG I haven't even read all these answers yet and I"m dying laughing! <br>  <br>  Barbie - a jet tub! How creative! I love it! And the beaters ... I won't even ask!<br>  <br>  Let's see ... we've flushed a few things, namely a block that I still am not sure how it fit. Yesterday my son dropped the entire brand new roll of TP in the toilet. And once I accidentally dropped my cell phone in it and had to get it replaced. <br>  <br>  We have more of a problem with things going down the drain ... Matchbox cars, wash rags. ... our drains still don't sound right.<br>  <br>  LOL Des - I'm still not sure what my son did the other week, but it produced a flood. My husband was not happen. <br>  <br>  I guess it's karma, though, for that time as a toddler when I saw my parents emptying my diaper in the toilet ...I did the same thing and flushed ... and that was in the days of cloth diapers. Yuck.|`|eu6UQElYaa	We found a chain, the top of a toilet bowl cleaner brush, 2 trucks and small bouncy ball in our toilet.   The plumber was laughing hysterically.   I was laughing too, until I got the bill.|`|1s3nddaYaa	my son has threw the soap in the toilet that wasnt fun getting it out. We have to keep the door shut, that is also the first place he runs when its open lol|`|jG8b3Mz0aa	A pen, I still haven't found those spoons either. I think my daughter flushed them down the toilet.|`|lkhCeAdJaa	Underwear<br>  Had to have the Rotor Rooter guys come and snake the line. They pulled out a pair of Spider Man underwear size 4.|`|AA11327039	A rainbow colored poo.  (Think rainbow Goldfish crackers)|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	a baby duck the kids found in the yard ..they knew it needed water..OMG|`|796de2a4227333484ebac3deccc1937eaa	I don't have children yet, but when I was little my Mom found me standing in front of the toilet sticking my hands in the water and rubbing them together (there was nothing in there). She asked me what I was doing and my answer was, "washin' my hands". I had the right concept but not the right water source!<br>  <br>  The next story doesn't involve the toilet but the bathroom itself and the garbage can. When my little brother was born I was less then pleased to have a crying baby in the house. One day when my Mom stepped out of the living room for a minute I picked my baby brother up and put him in the bathroom garbage can. I then left him there and went back to my movie in the living room. When my Mom returned she asked where my brother was and I denied knowing a thing. She quickly found him but surprisingly he didn't cry. He just calmly sat there and waited. Needless to say, I was in timeout for that one! <br>  <br>  I loved reading the answers! They had me cracking up the whole time. Great question!<br>  <br>  Brit|`|ybexjS2Paa	Two rolls of toilet paper ( whole ones), socks, pens, my toothbrush!

A few quarters and some pennies.  I still have no idea why.<br>  <br>  Oh and gold fish food.  Once. My kids thought that the goldfish we flushed might be getting hungry.  They dumped the entire can of goldfish food into the toilet........but didn't flush it.|`|prqrQcd1aa	At my own home.. Children's toys! When i was younger and living with my mother. A dead mouse! We didn't even have any other mice in our house except that one..but i had drowned it's self. I"m just glad I wasn't the one that had to fish THAT out!|`|NI8D46J0aa	When my son was about 2 1/2, I told him to go throw his diaper away, and I found it a little while later in the toilet. Thank goodness he didn't know how to flush. lol|`|4lHJEq5Haa	My husband's pet iguana.<br>  One morning I'm walking into the bathroom half asleep and there chillin out in the toilet was Izzy the green iguana. I guess he was hot or something. I made my husband get him out. It was kind of funny though!|`|AA11089301	A candle, toy car, diapers, whole roll of toilet paper, toy boat and probably others i can't remember right now.|`|T52u1DVXaa	Worst thing I have had to fish out would be a silver locket.

tdNfQWaAaa	I'm sooo sorry to hear that. I know how you feel, but trust me, things will work out. They just have to. You just have to keep up your faith. I'm due to start my period tomorrow and I feel like I could any second.. We have only been trying 5 months, but it already feels like forever.. Just think positive and remember we are all here for you. Baby dust!!!! xxxx|`|wom2ER4Baa	i can understand how you feel but have hope and keep trying.if you have irregular period please consult with doctor|`|OmuE1MTBaa	do you know why your periods are irrelgular?<br>  eating certain foods can help i heard.|`|DN6XtoViaa	i know how you feel.. my period showed up full force like literaly right after i dipped a test in urine! lol, it really sucks.<br>  <br>  keep your head up though.. it will happen and this journey ttc will be very worth it when its our time :)<br>  <br>  good luck and may God bless you soon!|`|syrh8J6Vaa	Pregnancy symptoms and PMS symptoms are almost identical.

x647LeB2aa	That is such a difficult question to answer.<br>  <br>  My first born would have been 11 now but he died of leukaemia when he was six.<br>  <br>  My middle child is 5.<br>  <br>  My youngest will be 1 on the 12th of this month.<br>  <br>  Would I have things different?  Not have had a child who died?  To never have had him? Part of me says 'yes' because of what he had to go through: A BMT, surgery to remove his spleen, being wired into IV drips 23 hours a day for the last 12 weeks of his life, being doubly incontinent and a whole host of other dreadful stuff.<br>  <br>  BUT I did have five fantastic years with him before he was diagnosed.  He was the one who taught me to be a mummy.  I don't know if I would want to 'go back' and have the fact James existed erased and just have my younger two children.  I cannot imagine him to have 'never been' even though he 'was' for such a short time.<br>  <br>  Him being 'taken back' would mean that I would not feel the pain I feel every day of my life.  I could live my life in some happy oblivious bubble yet even knowing that, even if that were possible I would still do it all again.|`|cAtWxJG1aa	No way.<br>  <br>  But I wouldn't judge someone else for feeling that way.  I'd judge them only if they were somehow communicating that to their children.|`|EtCRnDJMaa	then maybe you need to get that in writing because she might do something she shouldn't to the kids.   She's a sick person for ever saying that.  <br>  <br>  I don't ever regret having any of my girls and would NEVER even say such a thing.  <br>  <br>  something is wrong with somebody who says that.|`|YkseyT7zaa	Seems the issue is with the BF and not the Kids.<br>  the kids didn't do anything<br>  The choice of having children should be weighed heavily and not just written off to some night of passion.<br>  <br>  it's the bed you made so now you have to sleep in it|`|j2mRop0laa	No, I wouldn't. That is very sad that she feels that way. Maybe she needs to talk to someone professionally. She sounds very depressed.|`|flqAr30laa	Not for anything in this world.|`|hKJIDdVqaa	Never would I take them back.  I really rather enjoy my kids. I love to watch them grown, and learn.  I love to see the look on their faces when they make a new discovery, or finally figure something out.  I love when they smile, and laugh, I even like when they are sad and wanna cuddle.  I love that my 10 year old son will still hug and peck my cheek even in front of his friends.  I like when they debate with each other over the silliest thing.  I could never and would never take them back.  I would be sad and lonely without them, they are part of my husband and I.|`|eu6UQElYaa	No I wouldn't.   My kids can be a handful and sometimes I think it would've been easier if I spaced them out further apart but that doesn't mean I'd ever "take them back".   <br>  <br>  Sounds like her problems are the result of her sh!thole boyfriend and not her kids anyways.  Maybe she should send his sorry butt back.|`|8RfmosODaa	NO I wouldnt change a thing! EVERYTHING happens for a reason. Thats just wrong for her to say that. If things were so bad then she shouldn't have been thinking of having kids but she did and she shouldnt want to "take them back" if she could!|`|T864ejaiaa	no. your sister is not happy with her life right now. she needs to get away from that jerk. get help and learn to cope again. i'll pray for her. god bless.|`|auUeI2Vnaa	Not for anything in the world.  I think your sister needs to ditch her long term boyfriend.  It seems like he's the problem, not the kids.|`|nmu6coapaa	Thats a horrible thing to say, my 3 month old son is a lot of hard work but I wouldn't be without him for all the world!|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	nope not a chance.  i can't imagine my life w/out my kids.  i am grateful for them every single day - even when they drive me nuts|`|7d84621e89c49bcba037226d3361c90baa	It sounds like she'd better get into some counseling.  Now.|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	Wow. That's kind sad, like she's punishing the kids because of the way her asshat boyfriend behaves. Why doesn't she do them all a favor and leave him? Who knows ... she might actually be ... dare I say it - happy! Who needs that? Why put up with someone who treats your children badly? Sounds like it's more her problem if she won't leave, then, and she's making her children suffer twice over because of it. Sorry ... that's how I feel. <br>  <br>  I think parenting, especially in these difficult times with this 'crazy world,' is what you make of it. Yeah, we're approaching some pretty desperate times, but I'm having my third baby and as difficult as it might be to bring another life into this world, I'm doing it anyway. It's all in how I make the most of my time with my kids, what I teach them, and how I teach it to them. My faith helps me a lot and I don't know how people can live without it - but to each his own. I suppose if I didn't believe in God, then yes, things would seem pretty hopeless. <br>  <br>  Maybe you need to schedule an intervention for your sister. She needs some help, it sounds like.<br>  <br>  ETA: And even at the worst of times, I would never send my kids back. I can't imagine anything without them, and don't want to bother trying. Today we just learned that a colleague of my husband's has died - he was barely in his 40s and left behind several children. It's the second of his colleagues to die this year - the other one left behind a 4 year old and an 18 month old, so life is fragile and should be handled with care. You just never know.|`|iHJuXKBiaa	I can't say that I regret having my kids since they are my life, but occasionally I feel like I should've explored my options with being single when I was younger. I've been with my husband since I was 16, and I didn't get to do a lot of the things I would've liked to have done then.<br>  <br>  But to say I never should have had them...NO FN WAY!|`|sVdQSMvJaa	I would NEVER NEVER NEVER EVER take back my daughter....she brings a joy that is beyond understanding in to my and my husband's life!  Everytime I look at her I see the goodness of my Loving Heavenly Father and I would never want to erase that from my memory.|`|DNygQdmVaa	No I never feel that way.<br>  <br>  i wish my mother was still alive so she could care for her boys.<br>  And itd be easier i wouldve waited longer to have Cameron.<br>  <br>  But life is what it is, and I wouldnt have it any other way.|`|Mapm6AI8aa	holy crap i think she's nutz, guys. hu wuld have kids if this was for what? i wuld MURDER MYSELF  if i had such a mom. but thnz, anyway. u show me that ihave to b thankful of the mom i have... not u.<br>  ;D|`|prqrQcd1aa	No way in the world would I. I've been through my trials and tribulations with my own 7 year old, and her issues but I wouldn't take her or her sisters back for anything!|`|ENANtueuaa	Of course not!!! I love my daughter to death! <br>  You're sister needs to ditch the boyfriend if he treats her kids like crap! That's awful!|`|130816e5bf662924b68497e6577df429aa	Your sister and her boyfriend need some parenting classes NOW. He is a horrible person for taking out his anger at his children (especially if it's not even them he's mad at). She is a horrible mother for allowing a man to treat her children like that. If she doesn't protect her children's mental and physical health, who will?  They both need to realize that no matter how they feel toward each other, their kids need love and encouragement. What a sad situation for the kids- they can't do anything to improve their situation or protect themselves. They're being mentally abused and they don't deserve it. I think they'd be better off out of that household, what with a father who takes out his anger on them and a mother who regrets having them. If I knew who your sister was and where she lives, I'd report her to Child Protective Services. People like her and her boyfriend need to realize what a gift children are.|`|5edd13b91e6ca6a91c699a9220d74413aa	to be honest, i feel that way some days.  two of my three kids have life-threatening diseases (the first was diagnosed when we were expecting the second) and it's going to be rough road for them, including the one who might be left alone if the other two die.  i also lost my parents to a drunk driver, and our family is dealing with mental health issues.  i have to stay home with the kids and i hate this job.  all this came up after the kids were born.  sometimes i think if i could go back and know then what i know now, i wouldn't have brough them into this mess.|`|7jXChfBNaa	i love my daughter more than anything in this world. she is my rock and my pride of joy. i would never in a million trillion years say a thing like that. that is the most horrible thing i have ever heard. those poor twins. it's not like it's their faults it's hers cause she got freakin pregnant! that is truly an awful thing to say. i think you are going to get a lot of negative input on this question and a lot of angry parents.|`|XPnCeJ29aa	I feel like that sometimes.<br>  But more so because I feel that I am not in the right place in my life to have a baby.<br>  But he has brought more happiness (and struggles) than I could ever ask for, he has made me a happier me, and a stronger me.<br>  We will get to that place in life together.<br>  <br>  -Thumbs downs dont hurt, although they seem offensive.<br>  But I know I am the best mother my son could ask for. I give him the world and more. Emotions are emotions. My actions speak volumes.|`|hOGAgVASaa	you know i could really see both sides cant you?<br>  i mean if i was put in her position i might think of that yet i know that is an awful thing to say an i know i wouldn't want my mom saying that about me , i suggest she ditches the scum bag and works it out on her own and get a baby sister,or w.e it may be,once the eldest one gets older it will just get easier , she will be on her own more,<br>  but as you were saying i agree not a nice thing to say but i could see her side!|`|sfn7RP1yaa	I to had a daugher at a young age. Now she is 7. And there were times when she was a baby that i wished i had waited. My theory though was that I would "take her back" only if i knew for sure that i could get her back in the future when i was ready. The bottom line that is very selfish thinking. I completely understand where she is coming from though she hates him probably but cant leave him cause he is the father of her children and financially takes care of them right? Either she has to leave him and go it alone or suck it up and take it. Either way it will be hard. And this is her life weather she chose it or not. This is what it has become and now she can just make the best of it. And trust me if it ever came down to it and she was really offered offered that chance i doubt she would take it! Just tell her to take one day at a time and start bettering herself. Now is the time to make sacrifces to have a better life in the future! Good luck to you both!
AA11564277	yeahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. us teens dont look at it that way.<br>  we are focused on getting our own apartment with friends, staying up late, and drinking, and well the other thing too.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  jsut kidding, at least that is not what i am thinkiing!|`|axOJ2XUIaa	I'm not sure what your question was, but it sounds like you did a good job.  Feels good, huh?|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	thanks for the update ..we were all wondering|`|JILkhKjJaa	Your question is???????????????????????????????
zATQaiwIaa	to start off - you have to realize that some of the 'no no's" they tell you about are just stupid.<br>  <br>  Exersice can begotten many different ways - even just moving all day counts, I dont count me not physically going to a gym not exercising....I have a 4 year old to chase after i work all day.<br>  <br>  Yeah so equal is not great - but it is better than those pregnant women that smoke - not judging those that do but its the honest truth. <br>  <br>  Caffeine in moderation is fine, especially if your body is used to it - i drink 2 cups of coffee or the equivilant every day, my daughter was born 8lb10oz and is a healthy 4 year old.  I am almost 37 weeks and still drink 1-2 cups a day.<br>  <br>  i ate lunch meat through out both of my pregnancies (including this one)<br>  <br>  I dont drink diet soda though, but i still use my laptop!<br>  You cant listen to ALL the hype - you have to be able to seperate the BS.<br>  <br>  Congrats and best of Luck|`|215dfe0c283eb141a2ed0b4dcb32274caa	The only one I can think of is stomach sleeping. When I wake I often find myself lying on my stomach! I know, I know...but it really isn't something I can control!<br>  <br>  I had a conversation with my OB yesterday and she thinks I may be exercising too much, so I guess that's another one! I am like an exercise junkie, if I do not exericse I do not feel right. I feel restless and cannot sleep and I feel fatigued. It's not good! So I am going to try to slowly cut back and see if that helps me gain weight, that's the issue I am losing instead of gaining.|`|f1e593fccac158ae80c8df2916388085aa	I'm currently 5 (yes only 5) weeks with my 1st and I just can't seem to kick the soda habit.  I have limited from 1 2liter bottle a day to one 12 ounce can a day.  Boy do I miss Coke and Pepsi! But it's worth the wait since I have been TTC for 2 1/2 yrs.  Maybe the caffeine is why it wouldn't happen for me in the 1st place!|`|ITu6gONdaa	Im 39 1/2 weeks and....<br>  <br>  I dont exercise an hour a day<br>  I splurge on KFC every now and then<br>  I love hot cocoa<br>  I lay on my back sometimes (by accident)<br>  I will fall to the occasional soda<br>  I <3 Ho-Ho's|`|dRo89MsYaa	my pregnancy no-no's are:<br>  sleeping partially on my stomach<br>  drinking caffeine<br>  using a lot of salt<br>  not exercising much.<br>  <br>  as far as foods i eat, the doctor gave me free reign except for the dangerous things like tuna.|`|J2glFOkhaa	I have been craving ham and cheese sandwiches.. and have been giving in!!

OY.<br>  <br>  oh, i pick my son up ALL the time, even though everyone gets mad and tells me i shouldn't. oops, what am i supposed to do? he's 2 and i'm alone with him all the time.<br>  <br>  i drink tap water. <br>  <br>  oh, and worst of all, i forget my vitamin for like 3 days at a time...pregnancy brain, i just COMPLETELY forget about it. and i think i took it, but i didn't. and then i'm afraid to take it, cuz i don't know for sure that i DID'NT take it. how dumb is that. lol.<br>  <br>  ADD: about the laptops/microwave comparison....does that mean you shouldn't use laptops - period? cuz the rule about microwaves is don't use them, or when using them leave the room or stand at least 5 feet away. you can't use a laptop from 5 feet away.<br>  <br>  i don't get the comparison. i get if there bad, all electronics give off heat, some radiation...but nothing like a microwave. i used a laptop on my lap, with my son. with this pregnancy, i try not to use it on my lap, or if i do- i prop it up on a pillow...but neither of those things would really help in a microwave comparison. kwim?|`|483e49b9ba8ea322e76bb65dc8f82a66aa	Ha, lets see, I have drank several glasses of wine, I took dayquil and nyquil in the first few weeks (did not know it was "bad" then), I lift and carry heavy stuff like kids (I am a nanny) and I have been moving boxes in a closet to make room for baby stuff. I hardly ever eat fruit and am lucky if I get one serving of veggies a day. I eat whatever I want, soft cheese, lunch meat, whatever, I can't take fast food anymore though, makes me hurl right away. I forget to take my prenantal sometimes. I lay on my back or stomach if its comfortable. I never exercise. I use my laptop on my belly every day. I stand right in front of my microwave and wait for it to get done. I know there is more "bad" stuff I do but I cant think of it, I am not worried, my baby will be 100% normal, so far I have had a perfect pregnancy, have gained perfect weight and his measurements were perfect:)|`|1aHchY9raa	I drink tea with caffeine, every other day<br>  I crave for vinager, with lots of salt and pepper<br>  I dont exercise, I only walk<br>  I do eat some lunch meats once in awhile<br>  I sit with the lap top on my stomach somtimes<br>  I drink alot while im eating.. I neeeed to<br>  I always eat as healthy as possible though =)<br>  Im 19 weeks and 2 days pregnant.|`|KNxs4PrZaa	lol i have and continue to commit all of those sins, i have also eaten blue cheese dressing and dont tell anyone.......eaten a piece if sushi! i know! shameful!  with my first i was so paranoid i didnt even look at one thing on the bad list the whole time and frantically read ingredients and checked things online to make sure they were ok.  this time i have been feeling guilty because i have been so relaxed about it.  but so far no problems.  :)|`|Vf4w8dNNaa	I have to have a small cup of coffee every morning.  I try to stick with decaf though.<br>  And excersise?.....well I'm not doing as much as I should thats for sure.<br>  And I havent been drinking enough water.  A lemon helps, gives it some flavour.|`|s4OtfZ7Gaa	i drink coffee every few days. i'm on 'pelvic rest' but i still have sex occasionally. but that's about it.|`|eDmdkUO3aa	By the 5th month I quit exercising. I had lunch meat here and there. Sounds like you are having too much caffeine/soda.|`|Eqln1jmNaa	caffiene, peanut butter, lack of enough excercise and soda occasionally|`|fPAlfokHaa	im not eating that healthily :(<br>  but i dont smoke drink or do drugs..<br>  but we're pregnant not saints, they can't expect us to be perfect :(<br>  and i love fizzy drinks :( and chinese :(|`|hxcv75FIaa	im 32 weeks and had soft boiled eggs today!|`|PwhrTNZraa	I'm pretty much the same as WolfGirl, in a nutshell.  <br>  <br>  And Lez L -- GOOD for YOU!!  It's great to eat all healthy and stuff but when you don't have an appetite, it gets to the point you just go ahead and eat whatever you can get down and keep down.  I've dropped 16lbs and finally now at 19weeks, I've been able to put 2 back on.   <br>  <br>  I go through phases lol, I HAD to have McD's for about 4 days, thankfully that bad habit only lasted a short time.  Now my current "no no" is sugar.  I need those darn marshmallow easter eggs, thankfully that no no is passing quickly as well.  I have a tea every morning, and usually one in the afternoon, fortunately I don't like strong tea, and this no no is not about to pass soon.  I try for decaf but I think I need the boost lol.  I am most comfortable when sleeping partly on my stomach, can't seem to break that habit.  <br>  <br>  This is my second pregnancy, and like the first one, I just go with the flow and do what feels right for me.  My daughter is a VERY healhty, energetic and smart 3 1/2 year old.  I agree with what someone else said::  We are pregnant, not saints.  We SHOULD be allowed to indulge every so often, so enjoy it!|`|KWJ7ju6qaa	I ate lunch meat; the odds of listeria (sp?) are very low!<br>  <br>  Also craving a hunk of blue cheese, will probably give into that.<br>  <br>  Occasionally have a soda; as i love the carbonation and seltzer water is getting old.|`|4e67Pdfvaa	I forget to take my prenatal every other day.. I feel terrible about it, but just keep forgetting!|`|QMxEjCpiaa	I am 15 weeks 5 days pregnant <br>  I drink a caffinated drink once every other day - sometimes a few days in a row if they are going bad, I sleep 1/2 on my stomach and 1/2 on my left side, I also sometimes sleep on my right side, I eat healthy but could eat a whole lot more healthier. I cross my legs above the knees and I sometimes carry the heavy groceries in from the car. Sometimes I skip my pre-natal vitamins ... not on purpose though, I just forget.|`|SnanuNKiaa	i'm drinking a 32oz McDonalds tea right now. Caffinnee no no. i don't excersize, but i didn't before hand either. and i try to eat right, but fast Food is so much easier. plus its hard to cook during a 10 hour shift. And if im eating dinner i'll have some pepsi. other than that i drink water. I'm cheating today though|`|QSodlfMraa	omg i do the lap tap on my lap too<br>  i drink caffeine ever once in a while<br>  i eat hot dog for lunch every chance i get<br>  they is so much more<br>  i feel so guilty about it.|`|3X0t8JrXaa	Lets see...I have yet to take a pre-natal vitamin because I was lucky enough to skip morning sickness and feel that will be my downfall (I drink Ensure every day to try and compensate), I drink 2 sodas a day (which my doc said was okay), my tummy is the best place to rest my laptop (until it burned my stomach one day (yea I was a loser and didn't even realize those things get hot, duh!!!), I don't exercise anything but the hand I use to turn the TV (I feel walking to my car when I get off of work is plenty exercise), and I rarely eat dinner because my stomach doesn't seem to appreciate it and the heartburn seems to want to get rid of it (not as tasty the 2nd time down).  I think we all deserve a little slack.  I go to my doctors appointments regularly and baby is fine and healthy.  Now I commend anyone who is doing the best for their baby but I can't believe someone would get on a high horse about it and lecture us all.  You know the parents that overdo stuff and follow every book to the detail don't make their babies any smarter or healthier...they just make themselves feel special really.  (rolling my eyes)  Just following the advice of normally a man who has never had a baby.  Its advice not laws.
HYGPyxAHaa	I am 29 weeks today and I feel less movement as well. I asked my doc yesterday and he said just make sure you feel everyday. I get nervous though so I will lay down when I can and wait for her to move. Its funny how used to the movement you  get. I really rely on it as a source of comfort that she is doing okay. <br>  But like the others have said this seems to be normal. My doc does not have me do kick counts but I am going to start doing them every night to make sure all is well. Take care happy May Baby!|`|eV7rtxmuaa	I can only speak from my experience... When I was 28 weeks my daughter was still very active... She started slowing down around 34 weeks because there was hardly any room left. Everyone is different. If you have concerns definately bring them up with your doctor.|`|8RfmosODaa	Ive heard that since there isnt much room in there the baby cant move as much. If you have any concerns call your obgyn.|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	yes less room|`|Y1Lb5f4Eaa	I've noticed my son has big movement days and not so big days. Some days I'll realize I've gotten so busy I can't remember him kicking. Seems like when that happens he kicks right away. Like he knows I'm worried about him. I have noticed I'm not getting them as frequently as I was before, but his little kicks and stretches are just as strong as they ever were when I do feel them.|`|dRo89MsYaa	i'm only 14-16 weeks along, but according to what some of my friends who've been pregnant said, it's normal because the baby doesn't have much room. try talking to your doctor just in case though. they keep telling me that when I feel normal movement to report any changes.|`|PwrF9OtWaa	totally normal. the baby is getting bigger and there is less room for it to move around in. just make sure there is a healthy amount of action going on in there, which it sounds like there is, and you're all good!|`|qJBMdL7gaa	Yes...thats normal...As your baby gets bigger, its too cramped in there for them to do alot of moving! Just as long as you feel him/her moving at least once a day...I wouldn't worry!|`|SoRLHQeRaa	yes, they have less room x|`|uCnmYEPBaa	I'm 31+ weeks pregnant and my lil boy is still moving like crazy. I swear sometimes I think he is practicing for the olympics.<br>  But yes normally as you get farther along the movements slow. But keep an eye on them and as long as you can feel at least 10 kicks/movements in an hour every day then you should be fine.|`|eu6UQElYaa	It's normal for them to slow down some as they get bigger because there is less room to move.  As long as it still moves then there is nothing to worry about.
ROJans2Taa	LOL I started getting annoyed as well, mostly with my first, I was pretty young and kept getting glares and people thinking they had the right to tell me how irresponsible I was,lol. take it with a grain of salt, it only gets worse once you have them, I sometimes drone them out, go away in my head to a peaceful place. luckily it seems you have people who care enough to ask, think of it like that. best wishes|`|v3LnJycKaa	oh just smile... when people make comments I just say, Oh yes I spoke to ny dr about that and he says it is a myth... <br>  <br>  sleeping on your t ummy is fine as long as you are comfortable... your body will let you know enough is enough... peanut butter can cause allergies if given to a baby before the age of 1 (might be 2 cant remember, but same with strawberries) not a fetus... <br>  <br>  When are you expecting? everyday I would hope<br>  <br>  When are you due, just give them a season, it works for stars, Early summer, late spring, etc... <br>  <br>  are you going to find out what you are having... well we know it is a baby. <br>  <br>  any names... nope... <br>  <br>  people wan to be involved and act like they are helping, it is ok to play kate them a touch dont ya think????|`|43a27c0e1eef30eef2164c4c15242ab3aa	Just smile and nod lol and it doesnt end when the baby is born it gets worse!!!!  I usually just listen to what they say if I feel confrontaional I go back at them or I just smile and nod.  I have a 19 month old and I am 20 weeks pregnant and STILL get unwanted advice I just dont listen anymore.|`|7d84621e89c49bcba037226d3361c90baa	Welcome to the world all mothers have to go through. lol.<br>  Seriously, the best thing you can do is just smile and say "I've got everything I need to know from my doctor, thank you for your concern, though."<br>  <br>  Just understand that as irritating as it is, they mean well.|`|8WRnqs08aa	Welcome to Motherhood - this must be your first!<br>  <br>  Everywhere you go, there will be people who'll throw their unsolicited advice out to you. They do it to Moms who already have children, too. Pregnancy is just one of natures wonders that is so miraculous and women love to share their pregnancy stories with others, especially the first timers.<br>  <br>  It's pretty difficult to get away from, but you need to trust your own instincts. As far as allergies goes, studies are actually leaning towards the aversion of such foods, as the culprit for one developing allergies. I love PB & if it were bad for pregnant women, WIC wouldn't give it us!<br>  <br>  It is frustrating, but somehow you'll manage to deal with it. It does get better!<br>  <br>  Best of Luck & Congratulations!!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Mother to 4 beautiful children with Twins due 09/2009 (Babies #5&6)|`|KRE5oflKaa	LOL.....you sound like me when I was pregnant with my first.  The one I hated most was when someone out of the blue would come up and put their hands on my belly.  One time at Walmart, this lady came up to me and grabbed my stomach and started talking about the baby.  Oh,....did I flip out on her!!! "What do you think you're doing? Are you crazy?  Whats your problem? Dont you have any common sence not to go around touching people??  I dont know you! I dont know where your hands have been! Get your slimy, greasy hands off of me!!" Wow did I make a scene.  I hated when people touched my belly without my permission!!!  YEah, a big fat pregnant women!!!!!!!! BIG DEAL!!!!!  Leave the belly alone for cry'in out loud.|`|dCLnLlsCaa	Yes I feel your pain!  The most annoying part for me is that most of the unwanted advice is coming from my friends who have never been pregnant!  This is my 2nd pregnancy people, I know what I'm doing! <br>  Anyway, best you can do is just ignore it and "don't sweat the small stuff".  It's not worth the energy it takes to get annoyed.  If it really bothers you, then just say you know what you're doing and if you need advice you'll ask.|`|s4OtfZ7Gaa	hehe, i understand where you are coming from. i eat tons of peanut butter. you just have to accept it as their way of trying to be involved and that they care. just be thankful that your family and friends are close to you and care about you and the baby. when you dont want to deal with it, just dont answer the phone for the day, that's what i do. they will leave a message and if it's an emergency you call them back|`|dRo89MsYaa	i know how you feel. sometimes you just have to politely point out to them that you can't take the advice and you will come to them if you need to. <br>  btw, just for the record, i'm pregnant too and eat peanut butter and sleep partially on my stomach. right now it's the only way i can be comfortable at night. the doc says it's fine, so tell them not to worry.|`|7KEW7fxxaa	I am 33 weeks with my first for me and my husband and I have tons of them people to. They started from day one and our still going. Just tell them you dont want there opinions right now. People have opinions and they seem to have alot to say about if i get him circumsized or not or if i have an epidural all sorts of stuff. I just learned to ignore them or when they start change the subject. I hope you enjoy your pregnancy because it is a fun and wonderful experience. Even with having GD and falling like a clutks it has been awesome.|`|B6Mfx5fUaa	I know exactly what you mean...I'm experiencing the same with my mother-in-law, and numerous other people.   It can be very annoying, but you just have to keep in your mind that they only care.  Best of luck to you!!|`|1cFA5hpfaa	I don't know but I would love to hear this!   I am almost 12 wks right now.  Thank goodness we haven't told anyone yet!  although, there is someone that I know that still gives the advice even though no one at work knows!   My favorite has been "you are going to be so sick throughout your whole pregnancy, you are going to hate pregnancy".  Wow, that's helpful.  But, I just smirk because here I am pregnant and not even a touch of morning sickness.  Well, I guess I just proved her wrong!<br>  <br>  I am just going to try to remember that most people that I know mean well.  If I don't know them, I am going to make crazy things up to amuse myself and watch them squirm for asking a personal question to someone they don't know.|`|9979bb6f0e03a8d3d1be61eab96d087daa	I agree with Trixie on this one.  After I found out I was expecting 7 months ago - everyone was excited and asking questions and loved giving advice.  What was their advice?  Not sure, I just nodded my head, smiled and thanked them.  They mean well and it doesn't hurt to listen to them, you don't have to follow any of it, but don't be rude and act like you don't care.  Just say 'thank you for the input, I've been reading my baby books and it tells me all of the do's and don'ts, but thank you for tellling me"<br>  <br>  Pregnancy is a time of joy and learning - you never know, some of that advice might come into play.<br>  <br>  If you don't want people excited for you and happy about your new baby - then you need to close yourself off in a room and wait for it to be born - other than that - learn to live with other people and the attention you will be getting from here on out.|`|yPNvecc7aa	People asking you questions only means they care. I think it's wrong of you to voice out loud that it's annoying. Yes it's annoying, but if everyone ignored your pregnancy, you'd be singing a whole other tune.<br>  <br>  As for the "experts", just contradict them. I find it's always the same people who tell me "do this" or "don't do that". It works to just tell them you do the opposite and your doctor doesn't care.<br>  For example last week, someone told me I shouldn't be sleeping on my back. I told her right clear, my doctor hasn't said anything about it and when did she get her medical licence? The next time she has a bowling ball in her stomach and tries to get comfy in bed, I'll listen to her opinion.|`|d3jtRA8caa	Well I personally try to enjoy the questions of when are you due, and if I want to know the gender. Just tell the person who is giving you advice that you know whats best for you. Follow your instincts thats what I suggest. You'll know whats best for you.
24a78cc0007d10093367ee4cc375a0f6aa	Give birth at a different hospital is you aren't comfortable with the situation.|`|HXfHkoSHaa	You can go to a different hospital.  No one can force you to give birth there.  I gave birth a a non-teaching hospital, yet there was still a nursing student there.  I was asked without pressure, and it was a woman, so I was ok with it.  But I understand where you're coming from.  No way would I want a Grey's Anatomy scene in my hospital room!|`|c73QkZ2haa	Even at a teaching hospital you have the right to refuse students being in the room. Its your privacy and if you do not want to be seen by students you dont have too. <br>  Mine was a teaching hosp to and i told them flat out i respect that this is what you do but i would be more comfortable without tons of people even if they are doctors in training.|`|7bdhpvc9aa	Just come plain out and tell them that you only want so many in the room at a time. I would call now and tell them that you only want your doctor and two assistants in the room. You should be given that decisions. If they say it isn't possible then you can change doctors and hospitals. Good Luck & Congrats|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	Switch care providres.<br>  <br>  Sorry but that's the nature of teaching hospitals. And that's why I birth with a midwife and even she's only in the room during birth IF I request it.|`|yPNvecc7aa	You should talk to the hospital ahead of time, obviously.<br>  Or switch hospitals.|`|Od73sfkxaa	When you go to fill out your paper work, look through it carefully. I believe that you have to sign a paper, to allow interns to watch.<br>  <br>  One time I had a UTI and I ended up in the hospital. I was in so much pain and I didn't realize what I signed...turns out it was for an intern doctor to watch them give me a pelvic exam...I was sooo embarrassed and confused.<br>  <br>  Just watch your paper work, and give the hospital a call and talk to someone. There may only be 1-2 interns, I doubt they would have a whole class there to watch you give birth.<br>  <br>  I wish you the best!|`|df378c28318ff6097f7f272b0367e6cbaa	I'm a nursing student and before we are allowed to see any new patients our instructer ALWAYS asks permission.  If I were you I'd make my intentions clear right away, that you do NOT want students watching or preforming procedures.  It is your right to refuse.  I know that nursing students will be in the OB unit in the next month when I deliver, and I too will refuse.  There is no way I'm letting classmates practice on me and my baby!|`|n4kIQYchaa	You should be asked and give verbal or written approval. If you didn't know they should still respect your wishes I would say to talk to your doctor and see what he can do. I allowed a student to come in while I gave birth but it was only one and although I'm not at very comfortable with my body either I really hadn't noticed anyway with the number of nurses coming in out anyway.|`|qKEKLOaEaa	I would talk to your OB and see if there was a way to make sure that no students would be attending. Be honest and just say that you didn't see the fine print and the idea of strangers being around you for this very personal event makes you  uncomfortable.  Your Doctor should be in your corner on this one. No one should be able to deny you of your privacy. I would be very uncomfortable with this as well.|`|iQcd37Goaa	well ask them not to but if they won't help you .<br>   you might want to change hospitals|`|KyFCYs0Yaa	Although I can understand why you may be self conscious about it, from experience, labor and delivery will probably take away any and all inhibitions you may have. I almost delivered my daughter while being rushed from the triage, to the delivery room. I was uncovered, and there were at LEAST 10 people in the room when my daughter was born (it was a fast delivery) and I couldn't have cared less. I am usually a very private person. But in that situation, all I really could even think about was delivering my baby. You really don't notice everyone watching, unlike a breast exam. (I could see that being a little too much!)<br>  Good Luck, and if you don't think you want to deliver there, it isn't too late to change doctors, or hospitals! Congratulations on your baby!|`|G2auAv1Saa	The hospital I gave birth at has to ask your approval to be treated by a student or to have student observations. <br>  Discuss it with your doctor before you go into labor and see what your options are.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	Yeah, I gave birth at a teaching hospital. During my c-section, I got to hear the OB quizzing the student assisting him on like, parts of my uterus.  Apparently I asked one of the nurses to tell them to shut the **** up.<br>  <br>  My only advice is that while it's going on, half the time you have no idea who these people are anyway.  And after it's over, you don't care that much.|`|IlyS8KGzaa	I don't know what to say.  At the hospital I was at, the students HAD to ask for my permission to be in the room.  I agreed to let them in because they had been at the hospital all week and had yet to see a baby born.|`|oUtEVKDHaa	Either way A LOT of people will see you naked I'm sorry to say. Not soo many but more than you wish too. and honestly I was like you too but at the moment you really don't care who see's you as long as you get the baby out. that's what i think|`|K2jT1z5jaa	if your not comfortable about it, You dont have to do it. Switch hospitals god bless x|`|AA10624857	I live in Michigan, too. I don't know what hospital you are going to deliver at, but my youngest was born at U of M Hospital in Ann Arbor, a teaching hospital. I've given birth 4 times and truthfully, I think it reaches a point in the labor and delivery process where you really don't care who sees you naked you just want that baby out. My prenatal care was also done through the high risk clinic at the hospital since I was 38 and had Gestational Diabetes. My whole entire pregnancy I dealt with different doctors, nurses, and students. Maybe because it was my 4th baby, it really didn't bother me. If you are in an OB practice with just one doctor you can speak with him/her about having limited people present during the birth. However, if your OB care is being done in a multi-provider practice you may very well have your delivery done by someone you don't know well or haven't even met. When my youngest was born, I went into labor unexpectedly as a result of a bad reaction to a prostoglandin gel insertion. I had people in and out of there on a regular basis and I don't think I could have told you who any of them were. I never had the same doctor at my prenatal visits, but if you do, then that would be your first place to start. I always am baffled by the people who are going into nursing or medicine who feel it was fine for them to learn on patients when they were students, but when it comes to them being patients they are adamant about no student learning on them. I think it is hypocritical thinking. Student doctors and nurses aren't there just to get a free peek at a person's private parts but are there to learn so they can become good doctors and nurses. Some doctors have priviledges at other hospitals and maybe your OB can deliver at a smaller non-teaching hospital.

fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	Keeping him on at least 20oz of formula should help a lot.<br>  <br>  Otherwise emphasize meats, as they have protein, zinc, and iron as well of fat all of which are needed for adequate growth.  Meat is not a common allergen however if you are concerned then turkey (preferably dark meat as its more nutritious), lamb, and goat are considered the least allergenic (ironically I was allergic to poultry fat as a child so dark turkey was usually ok unless I ate a lot *lol* but some people are, of course, allergic to turkey)<br>  <br>  Also avocado and olive.<br>  <br>  Please insist on getting a referral to an allergist though they will have much better advice.  Normally I recommend egg yolks, coconut, and ground flax or flax oil.  But I'm not sure any of those are an option in your case.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.westonaprice.org/children/nourish-baby.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.westonaprice.org/children/nou...</a><br>  Don't Fear Fats!<br>  <br>  Pediatric clinicians have known for some time that children fed low-fat and low-cholesterol diets fail to grow properly. After all, a majority of mother's milk is fat, much of it saturated fat. Children need high levels of fat throughout growth and development. Milk and animal fats give energy and also help children build muscle and bone.1 In addition, the animal fats provide vitamins A and D necessary for protein and mineral assimilation, normal growth and hormone production.27<br>  <br>  Choose a variety of foods so your child gets a range of fats, but emphasize stable saturated fats, found in butter, meat and coconut oil, and monounsaturated fats, found in avocados and olive oil. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://kellymom.com/nutrition/solids/toddler-foods.html" rel="nofollow">http://kellymom.com/nutrition/solids/tod...</a><br>  Good non-dairy sources of fats include soy and safflower oils, flax seed and flax seed oil, walnuts, fish and fish oils, avocado. Adding fats to cooking and baking can work well, for example, stir fry in safflower oil or make mini-muffins with soy or rice milk, oil or butter, and eggs.<br>  <br>  =========<br>  Edited to add:<br>  <br>  I meant to mention I love hummus but you should check the ingredients.  Many contain tahini/sesame seeds and sesame is one of the top 9 allergens, though ironically not one you hear about.  Mind you I'm one of two people in my family allergic to sulphites and that's in the top 9 and no one has heard of that either.<br>  <br>  Another thing you might want to avoid is annatto which is a "natural" food dye that gets used a lot in toddler foods because they can use it and say its all natural.  But its as allergenic if not more allergenic as synthetic dyes.  Because its used in such small amounts it can be a hard to detect problem.<br>  <br>  And finally, milk protein -any food labeled Pareve does not contain milk products of any kind.  Part of Kosher rules is that you can not mix meat and dairy.  Pareve means it is free of meat and dairy, and various regulatory bodies that certify things as Kosher are very, very serious about such things.<br>  <br>  You can see the various symbols commonly used: <a href="http://images.google.ca/imgres?imgurl=http://web.mit.edu/burton2/kosher_symbols%255E1.jpg&imgrefurl=http://web.mit.edu/burton2/studybreak.html&usg=__DGDeILLTyQ0e4ve2BmthTDih7bk=&h=538&w=553&sz=51&hl=en&start=1&tbnid=isqjsS8QCC4PRM:&tbnh=129&tbnw=133&prev=/images%3Fq%3Dpareve%2Bsymbol%26gbv%3D2%26hl%3Den%26sa%3DG" rel="nofollow">http://images.google.ca/imgres?imgurl=ht...</a>|`|930a625eb301aae633a9b9d8e18e0752aa	Olive oil on just about everything, avacado is good. Its a fattier food. Can he do hot dogs and sausage? If you cut them up small he should be able to. <br>  Bread and fake peanut butter. It tastes the same as peanut butter, but no real peanuts. It's made with chick peas.|`|FLpMShKNaa	My son was below the charts at age 1 as well-17 lbs, now at 14 months he's gained around a pound and a half. Pediasure helped but it likely has some dairy. I think there are ways to mix formula to up the calories but you have to be very very careful, I'd inquire with the doctor first Hummus is great, I have also tried adding flaxseed oil or olive oil to foods if you can. Its easier with pureed foods or maybe the beans? All the allergies really limit your options-I think there is a product called doucal  you can add it to foods to up calories? Good luck. :)|`|f298053ebd42df4c5da5f85a6ead96d4aa	Avocado, olive oil, and ground flax seeds or flaxseed oil. Use olive oil in most of your cooking - everything except baking. I also put ground flaxseeds in a lot of foods, from smoothies to oatmeal to using it as an egg replacement when baking or making pancakes. <br>  <br>  Also, I learned recently that it is important to make sure that toddlers are getting at least some refined grains in order to increase their caloric intake. Whole grains make you feel fuller faster, which is great for adults watching their weight, but can cause toddlers to not consume enough calories. <br>  <br>  You might also try leaving snacks out at his level for him to graze on all day.|`|hhWDHmfyaa	First, time to change doctors as anyone having the information you gave would be an idiot to suggest milk to your child.<br>  <br>  Rice milk.  We are a lactose intollerant family and my daughter lived off this.<br>  Cheese.  Hard cheeses have the lactose almost knocked out of him.  Try those instead of the soft ones.  <br>  <br>  Sorry for the slam.  I removed the vegan bit.  <br>  It is a recurring theme with all my child's sports and schools.  You will see it at about the time your little one enters kindergarten. The vegan kid is the sickly one, failing to thrive, uncoordinated, with all the learning disabilities and attention problems while that mom is telling the rest of us how wrong we are for including a few meat products in our healthy kids diets.  The vegan teen seems to do much better. It is the young years that seem to matter.  Good luck!|`|LhV8D2Xeaa	Try just adding more calories with juices. also rice milk is yummy. i would feed him more meat and potatoes too.  just increase his calorie intake and make sure he is getting enough protein. also if he isnt getting vitamins from the milk i would ask your doctor about a multi vitamin he can take so he will have strong teeth.|`|5e07813cce25cc51bdab8ac80e59c66faa	any fish allergies in your families? Salmon is a very good food! My son is 11 months and loves to eat it! You can find the pre-packaged filets for around $4 for about 4-5 of them.  I wish i had  more ideas for you.

Ybo6HS8Caa	I think all of us moms are guilty of over buying for our kids, and under buying for ourselves.  I recently started a new job, and because it was a complete career switch (I had been working as a CNA, and am now working in the corporate world), I had to get new clothes.  My husband, who absolutely hates shopping, took me out on Sunday and spent 6 hours shopping with me!  I was so proud of him for doing that, when I knew he wasn't having fun, and for giving me honest opinions about the things I tried on.|`|AkFag8tNaa	Yes! It's funny because I was the quintessential spoiled teenager. I slept in, thought money was for buying clothes, tickets to the movies etc...and didn't bat an eye at buying things for myself.|`|Pf9fyEyQaa	I am guilty of this.  Anytime I buy myself anything I just feel terrible about it and want to bring it back to the store.  I don't spend a lot on clothes or anything else I may want because the guilt sucks.  <br>  <br>  But it is okay to treat yourself every once in a while.  Taking care of kids is a job of it's own and you deserve a little something every now and then!  That's what I'll have to tell myself when I'm a mom!<br>  <br>  I can't answer the second part of your question exactly...but my SO always has to remind me that I'm entitled to get a little something every now and then and he truly enjoys when I spend some money on myself!  If it weren't for him I wouldn't have half the things that I do haha.|`|AA11109728	Yes!  My mom reminds me of that, as I'm a single mom and I feel guilty spending money on things that I don't 'need', such as a new cd or a new purse.  She reminds me that I do everything on my own, and that I deserve things for myself once in awhile.  All my bills are always paid on time, I have no debt, and my daughter and I have everything we need.  So I do buy something here and there on rare occasion that there's something I actually want.  As far as clothes, I'm lacking and can't seem to get there.  I get jeans when I need them, but it's hard finding ones I like that also fit right.  Same with tops.  My mom will watch my daughter sometimes on the weekend for a day so I can go look at things for myself and be able to try things on.|`|jG8b3Mz0aa	I'm guilty of it. I will buy something for the kids in the drop of a dime. For me it takes a while to realize I need to be spoiled as well. Sometimes my husband will say go out or call some friends and go shopping (that's very rarely). He knows me well since I haven't really gone shopping in awhile, I might go on a shopping spree. Not to mention it seems I've gotten I don't know wider (maybe)...seems like nothing will fit properly. I'm a small person to begin with and now I hardly have anything to wear. This baby weight needs to come off quickly.|`|nfzQkvqraa	Every year at Christmas my husband buys me a gift card with a significant amount of money to a clothing store.  He chooses stores I like that DO NOT sell kids clothing.  <br>  <br>  I have a habit of over buying for my kids, and under buying for myself.  That's his way of letting me know that it's okay to spend on myself.  And it's my way of being able to do it guilt free.|`|T52u1DVXaa	My problem is more buying food for myself.  I can go shopping for groceries and pick up many things my son, and my husband, enjoy, not to mention the applesauce my daughter loves.  But I come home and realize I've not bought a thing I like.<br>  <br>  My husband himself will often go and pick up a shirt or something for me if it catches his eye and he thinks it'll look good on me.

RwoN3E9Uaa	Vicks causes breathing problems in babies - I wouldn't use it at all.|`|BypjotRpaa	Vick's make an infant rub..its not as potent as regular Vick's but it is not harmful to the baby... also if you can buy a humidifier made by Vick's that takes inserts that will fill the room with Vick's . it really helps them to breath better. another tip is put the baby mattress on an incline to help the mucous drain. and you can also pick up some saline that helps to break up mucous, it made by little noses.|`|CzKrqgmgaa	i wouldn't try to use a mixture of the full strength stuff. i'd use Vick's baby rub. its fairly cheap and you don't need to use much of it. it has all the same aspects of the regular Vick's but not burning on baby's skin.|`|QOvUS6xVaa	there is baby rub by vicks for babys,, at night i mix a dab of regular one on his chest|`|Nux5S6oVaa	I would ask your physician- I'm a pediatric RN and I would say No.<br>  At 4months old babies skin is ultrasensitive.  I would sit in the bathroom with the babies with a hot shower running for the steam effect to help losing the congestion or use a vaporizor in the babies room...they make those plug in nightlight vicks vaporizers ( I saw it on Tv the other day.)  You could us a little vaporub in it to circulate in the air, but I wouldn't rub on the baby.<br>  <br>  Also try placing a rolled towel under the mattress to elevate the head alittle so the baby isn't lying flat.<br>  <br>  Massaging or little cupping (cup you hand an pat like you are burbing) on the back is helpful too!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|LY2LSzPJaa	I would just buy the baby Vick's , put on her feet then put socks on , it works , sounds weird but it does the job. <br>  Also at wal mart they sell this tab you put in the shower and it lets off vapors , its like $3 buy that and put in shower with hot hot water on and sit in there with her. <br>  Also there is a Vick's plug in you can buy and it lets of the vapors of Vick's also very cheap , its perfect at night , they breath it in ll night and you do not have to worry about skin sensitivity. <br>  Ok another one , buy chamomile tea and give her some , my mother in law told me about this and it works , anyway feed her chamomile a few times a day and she will poop out all the mucus. Its nasty but ive done it and I swear by it!|`|tk2AOZU5aa	NO, NO, NO! Saline drops for nose, followed by suction with bulb suction (the one they used when the baby was born to suck out nose and mouth). Cool mist humidifier in the room. <br>  <br>  You can use the saline drops and suction as often as necessary as it is basically just salt water and there is no medication in it. Vicks is never recommended even though they make one for "babies."|`|Z6CJApzJaa	Vick's makes Vaporub for infants. I've purchased it at walmart. If you wanted to mix it surely 50/50 would be fine.

HA HA the old lady behind me swears it will work !|`|pXSKSS3daa	You can just use Vicks Baby rub. That's what we use, pretty much like the "adult version" in consistency but geared towards little ones. I get ours at Walmart.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	Use baby rub by vicks. (Or any other similar product)<br>  <br>  Vaporub contains camphor which is highly toxic if ingested and even applying it to the skin of a baby can cause overdosing (though not as likely after 4-6 months).  <br>  <br>  It can also be far too irritating to a baby's delicate respiratory system.<br>  <br>  There is a reason it says very, very clearly on the bottle not to use it on baby's under age 2 years!
kaqPSgTVaa	My doctor tried to listen for it around 10 weeks with a dopplar, not via a vaginal ultrasound and she coultn't get it. Your uterus is still below your pelvic bone at this point so it's hard to find if she's just using a dopplar. The only heartbeat she could get was mine. :)|`|zSABr7praa	You can SEE the babies heart beat as early at 6 weeks, but i'm not sure as far as hearing goes!  I was able to hear mine at 9 weeks, but I know people who couldn't at 10 weeks and almost had a heart attack..  I wouldn't even suggest trying until you where 12-14 weeks along.. if the doctor wants to do an ultrasound you'll get to see the little heart beat flickering :)|`|f9d25be9a86bcb470e6b157992207144aa	I heard it for the first time at 9w5d. I had a vaginal U/S at 5w3d and that HB was not strong enough then to be heard then.|`|uFrqC4Y2aa	Yes, you should, but don't get upset if you don't. Not everyone is able to at 10 weeks.|`|wFe7L1XJaa	Im pregnant with number 2 and i saw the heartbeat through ultrasound at 8 wks 6days|`|215dfe0c283eb141a2ed0b4dcb32274caa	I hear my first child' heartbeat at 10 weeks but could not hear my seconds child's heartbeat at 11 weeks so my OB got out the ultrasound machine she has in her office and we took a look at the baby and saw a heartbeat! With my current child I was in at 8 weeks due to some stomach pain (too early to hear the heartbeat) and then back in at 14 weeks and we heard it loud and clear at that time. My OB says that it is easier to hear the heartbeat early on thinner women but sometimes the baby just doesn't cooperate with the position he/she is in, so it really depends on your size and the baby's position. But I think chances are good. The reason my OB has me wait until 10 weeks to have a first OB appointment is because at 10 weeks the heart beat is suppose to be able to be heard on the fetal doppler. Good luck, I hope you get to hear it-it's such an amazing thing, it really makes the pregnancy seem "real" at that point!|`|5puE2Qfpaa	Yes, I was so amazed to hear mine at 5 1/2 weeks. Then I heard it very strongly at 7 weeks 4 days. It was so strong that it read 145 with a vaginal ultrasound by then. Yes, you will be so excited to hear it today your first tear of this pregnancy will drop with joy!!! Best-Wishes!!!|`|5RvTXdmUaa	Usually I think it's 11 weeks. But depends on your dr, he/she might try. My doctor said she'd only try after 12 weeks. It can be scary if they for any reason can't find it. Which is very possible at this point. But cause un-necesary worry.<br>  Congrats!|`|Tj5WkS6haa	Probably not.  Even if your very skinny 10 weeks is a little early.  They usually try to listen at 12 weeks and on.|`|edLbogmYaa	Um I don't know why people say you can't because I heard my babies heart beat at 7 weeks!!!! Congrats and good luck!!|`|ZbnxGIsnaa	Definitely!!!  Now, they probably will wait till you are further along to let you listen to the heartbeart though.  It's stinky poos!  You could always buy a prenatal heart doppler like they use at the hospital or rent one.  You can listen to your baby's heartbeat from 8 weeks onward!<br>  <br>  Let me know how your appointment goes!  Awww, 10 weeks!  How time flies!
32a259f59d3088d2227a70c4bed9c8e6aa	Sounds hormonal to me...when you first get pregnant your hormone levels rise really high which will give you headaches.  Then after you have the baby- your body kinda freaks out cause your hormone levels go down. But I would keep an eye on it...if they dont stop in a week or so I would call the doctor.|`|ndO6MiQaaa	ya it could be or it could be tiredness or highblood pressure but id get it checked out|`|AA11099527	It could be hormones or low iron levels. i had both not fun.|`|3CG3rby0aa	Did you get an epidural done when you were in labor?

Morning sickness is only the name, but it can occur all day or just in the evening or just in the morning.|`|JgSX5jsUaa	Some people get symptoms right away and some don't get symptoms at all. It all has to do with hormone levels in your body. Morning sickness can kick in at 4 or 6 weeks and sometimes as late as ten weeks.

That's what my son drinks and he really likes it (he wasn't a fan of cow's milk and ended up being allergic anyway).<br>  <br>  If she doesn't drink any of that, just make sure she is getting enough HEALTHY foods like veggies and fruit - especially dark green veggies. For calcium, try calcium-fortified foods: pastas, bread, cereals, juices (etc) ALL have a good amount of calcium in them and that is one of the main reasons that milk is the main thing doctors suggest milk for.

6jcEtPPKaa	Hi,<br>  Wow, you have a lot of work to do, but it is very crucial that you stay strong and keep a positive attitude. Family is a package deal. Like it or not. They are given to us and we have to learn to deal with them. You are now an adult and you need to start worrying about yourself more than your parents. First off get a job if you don't already have one. Be outgoing and open to new people. Don't let your insecurities get the best of you because you will live a miserable life. If you don't like the way you look, well...... save up and go to a gym, buy better clothes. Don't let your parents control your life like that. And the whole "going back to Poland" situation..... sit down with them and tell them how you feel. If they don't listen, save up money and move out. <br>  Hope this helped.<br>  PS - I am from Romania. I came to the US when I was 12. I am now 20 and I love my life. I have a job, a good boyfriend and I go to college. I have also moved out when I was 18. I became Americanized while my parents are still stuck in Romania mode. lol. My father was here for 40 years and never adapted the American way of life. I am telling you this because I want you to know that you are not the only one dealing with foreign parents. My mom has been taken care of ever since we came here, and didn't know anything......except driving and a little English. After my father passed away, I got tired of helping her and I left her to do things on her own. She was forced to learn English and do things on her own. The only reason your parents are not learning English and are not more independent it's because they know that you will always be there.|`|Pwh9bDdKaa	I haven't been enrolled in college but i went to a open house type thing last year at my cousins college, really social there don't worry about that, I met a lot of cool people without introductions by my cousin etc. just walk the campus and spark a convo.|`|yJZeRu5Vaa	well they should be fine on their own once they go back to poland. and dont you make any friends at school or anything? you could invite them over to hang out since your parents are so nosy when you go out.|`|n9bmRv6iaa	GET A JOB!!|`|q2SEEXeqaa	go to the navy and be all you can be|`|89HhKWuIaa	Get out and meet people! Join local clubs and groups, eventually you will meet tons of new people, you have to come out of your shell! <br>  <br>  As far as your parents, sit them down and tell them how much you feel they are depending on you and it shouldn't be like that for you, this is the time of your life when you need to experience what else is out there and make it clear to them that you are serious about having your own life!|`|MkZ3hzTEaa	Sweetie pick yourself off of your pity floor and step up and be you. Want to make friends, then go make them. Go and be the best you. I know that's corny but it's true. As far as your parents, sit down and tell them what they are doing to you. Simply tell them you are a man now and must act like one. So stand up, dust yourself off and get ready for the new you. It's all up to you know. So what are you going to do.|`|f7c5471c72f7f084411ee3f3f3e4b818aa	Well, you want to be independent and i wanna lose some independence (it can be a real turn off to most guys..anyway...) For the most part I can understand why your parents don't wanna learn English. It's hard to learn and after you've reached a certain age you get comfortable with the way you are, you leave new things to younger people and you enjoy your retirement not having a care in the world. this is much easier since they have you so they feel much more comfortable. <br>  <br>  If you haven't told them how you feel then you need to do so. I know it can be a drag going everywhere with your parents...because it takes a lot of time out of your personal time. It's also a drag because what they're doing might not necessarily be interesting to you. <br>  <br>  You're 18. A man now.I can understand your parents keeping track of you though since you're not American and you seem too be the only one, as a child, around them.<br>  <br>  In order to gain independence you need to show people that you can handle it. Maybe that's why they rely on you and keep track of you so much; because you still seem like their baby. Start with taking over simple things. Like doing your own laundry, buying your own clothes, choosing your own hairstyle. Show them the individual in you and I assure you...you will gain your independence little by little.<br>  <br>  And., if you ever wanna chat you can send me an email! no prob! Good luck.

Firstly your child should not be in this position at school and secondly , as far as I know, children at 11/12 are considered to be legally responsible.

Its pretty hysterical watching women sniffing and inspecting "poopy" diapers :)  Also, there is always "The Price is Right" on common baby items, give everyone a clothespin and it gets taken if they cross their legs or say the word baby, cut a string to the length you think will fit around mom's belly, unscramble the baby words, a question game on "how well do you know the mom-to-be", sample the baby food and guess what it is, and oh so many others--you can do a google-search and find tons of sites!

0wTzlG2haa	The best I can tell you is to try as hard as you can to just relax. I was really stressed going into that ultrasound too...but there is so much that they show you and can tell about the baby by that stage that it is really cool. Also, keep in mind that they will most likely not find anything of concern. AND...if they find something that concerns them they will run more tests to determine if there is a real problem. From my point of view, I wanted to know if there was something to be concerned about because then I could prepare for it as much as possible.|`|B6Mfx5fUaa	I hate to disappoint you, but you are going to be worry for at LEAST the next 18 years or so!!

With the medical advances of the last century the risk of death in childbirth has been virtually eliminated.<br>  <br>  I worked nights in an ER adjacent to a Labour Delivery Room for a quarter century, and I do not think we lost a single mother.  I would have heard.  Whether by midwife of doctor, childbirth is a generally safe and uplifting (although messy) experience.<br>  <br>  Afterwards, you will ask yourself why you were worried.<br>  <br>  In the meantime, I hope you are not smoking, drinking or using drugs.  The real risk in modern pregnancy is poisoning your future child.  Your womb is like a computer:  if garbage goes in, garbage comes out.  Foetal damage will ruin your life, because your child can be damaged from the start.<br>  <br>  So eat well.  Take care of yourself and everything will be fine. <br>  <br>  After the birth, I recommend the La Leche League or its local equivalent.  They are a group that works to promote breast feeding, but my experience as a single dad with an eighteen month old the more experienced mothers there were an invaluable resource.  They already knew what I needed to learn and shared information willingly.<br>  <br>  Don't worry about a thing.  You are just fine.

Tvcn83Adaa	I feel that schools should have a broad range of sex education.  Including, being able to go the the school nurse, and getting information on birth control.  I have no problems with the nurse having condoms on hand to give to the student if they have talked about the risks, effectiveness, and best uses.  The nurse should also be allowed to give the students the contact information of a family planning clinic, so the students have other options for birth control.<br>  <br>  However, many of my friends are in total denial about their teenage children.  Having to face the reality that their kids are having sex is very difficult, and condoms at school make it all too real.<br>  <br>  On the other side, I do not like the idea of a bowl of condoms sitting at the front desk either.|`|v3LnJycKaa	If I was your schoolI would make them available in the nurses office, right next to a stack of pamphlets about tenn sex stats, and std stats... I would also make every child who stepped into the nurses office sign a waiver.|`|DRb4Qlypaa	Hmm. Well I live in Kentucky and graduated last year, too. My school provided condoms free and free no question pregnancy tests. The middle school did this as well, which was controversial. Someone tried to sue the school system for making it available in middle school because her daughter got pregnant but it never went to trial, her lawyer dropped her because he knew they wouldn't win. This was in my brother's 6 grade class. Sickening.<br>  Schools are limited at how early the can talk to kids about sex. Parents are not. My mom talked to me about sex when I was 7. I also got my period then, though. She started talking to my brother about it even earlier (I think about 5) and as a result, I didn't believe all the b.s. kids at school were putting around like if you have sex with the girl on top she won't get pregnant. I KNEW better, and was glad I did. That is the only way to keep kids from getting pregnant so early, talking to them years before they find their selves in the situation.|`|xc8bnpCvaa	I think it is BOTH the school and the parents responsibility. If the school wants to offer condoms, they also need to teach a Modern, up to date and thorough sex education program. Have parents sign a consent form for their child to be given protection. For those of them who don't want their child given protection, have them sign a waiver of responsibility for the school and the parent can take full responsibility for their child's actions. <br>  <br>  My son is 14 and my daughter is 9. I have already spoken to them both about sex and the risks as well as the responsibilities that come along with it. I want them to be well informed, more so than just being shown how to slide a condom on a banana|`|MPQCX5yhaa	It is the parents' job to teach their children about sex. Imo, this case should get thrown out.  I wish thee  school board could counter sue for something because this is pure foolishness. If the parents want to sue someone they should sue themselves. Nobody wants to take responsibility.<br>  <br>  Parents need to take their heads out of their butts and properly educate their children. Sex goes under life lessons that should be taught by the parents.|`|VWWowNiMaa	well i think they shouldnt cuz having sex at teenage years is bad|`|X6as2nOAaa	If I was on the school board I would make condoms available to them because whether you put it out there or not they are going to have sex alhtough I think if they want the condoms then they need to get a few lessons about sex before they can have them.|`|QSodlfMraa	yeah the school send home a permission paper for parents to sign if they do not want their children under 18 to have condom given to them, but if the kid is 18 and over let them have the condoms.

I am so jealous of the mom's who get to stay home and would really love to know what their husband's do to be able to afford to stay home! My daughter is at the "monkey" stage...monkey see monkey do and she repeats and does everything I do! Sometimes I obviously have to watch what I say now but I love that her little mind is so quick to repeat something and we do crazy dances together and it's just absolutely amazing!|`|nuBRcuwvaa	When people say "it gets easier" it doesn't mean within days or weeks.  It can be longer than that...<br>  <br>  I had the same experience... but my son is almost 2.5 now and he LOVES daycare.  He talks about his little girlfriends and he brings home all sorts of art projects for me.  He learns new songs and loves to sing them for me.  Etc.<br>  <br>  Now its easier... I can tell that he likes going to daycare, which we call "school." I think it is hard at the beginning because you worry that they are terrified without you.  I'm sure she misses you... and seeing you after work is her favorite minute of the day - I'm sure.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

Theres only a few of symptoms that come early, and you get very tired and start taking more naps then usual, and start getting more hungry, but morning sickness varies, because some women get it early and some dont get it at all. so you should start getting signs around 4 weeks on..|`|4ZbJhWuxaa	it depends on the woman as to what she gets and when.. nausea frequent urinations enlarged tender boobs. try googling it..|`|h6vqu7mjaa	I have 4 kids.

K2SOMH6iaa	when i was a little kid, i was a little freak, and i could NOT sit still ever, i was really crazy too, and my mom didn't do drugs or anything when she was pregnant with me, and it turned out that i was allergic to a TON of stuff, like wheat, and tomatoes, and onions, and eggs and dairy. so maybe she's allergic to something, or a lot of stuff.<br>  <br>  also, though, my brother is really hyper too, but his deal was that his birth mother (he's adopted), she didn't do drugs while she was pregnant with him, but she did take a lot of perscription medication when she was pregnant, and that caused him to kind of freak out sometimes, but i hope this helps, and if not, i hope you figure it out!!<br>  <br>  also, she's two years old, she's very young, so it really honestly might be something she'll just grow out of it, kids are really hyper sometimes, especially when theyre young.|`|TDgesvqpaa	My husband is going on 40 and still acts like that.

My daughter is 19 months old and never seems to slow down either. She'll sit down a read a book every once in awhile but only when she's sleepy.  I'm sure by the time she is three the doctors will be trying to push some kind of medicine on her...my suggestion is jsut find more activiities that she can have space and be able to run and get out some of the energy...there are just some kids that are overly hyper and you just have to read books and research different ways to exert that energy.|`|KmC0K59taa	I think this is perfectly normal.

Of course the absolute best thing to do is to check with a lactation consultant.  Besides from the La Leche League, most nurses in pediatrician's offices are LCs.  Assuming that you have picked a pediatrician beforehand, you could call there and ask.<br>  <br>  A little web research found this link of expressing colustrum by hand, which seems to be the preferable way since it is thicker and also there isn't much of it:<br>  <a href="http://forums.llli.org/showthread.php?p=462106" rel="nofollow">http://forums.llli.org/showthread.php?p=...</a><br>  This is a LLL website, so they are prejudiced,  but the several others I found all strongly suggested the moms express the the colustrum. This is from the CT medical center site:<br>  <br>  "Colostrum has extra high levels of several very important substances. These substances protect your baby from infection and promote the growth of your baby’s intestines. Babies can even benefit from tiny amounts of colostrum in their mouths and on their lips and gums. The anti-inflammatory, infection fighting substances in the colostrum are absorbed from the GI tract, and start working to protect your baby right away. " <br>  <br>  They also go on to suggest that you start pumping w/in 6 hours of giving birth if you want to establish a good milk supply later on.  They make it osund like your milk comes either way, but the supply is better established in a long-term kind of way if you pump/express from the very beginning.<br>  <br>  As far as taste goes, if your baby had trouble adjusting you could always mix breast milk and formula at first, then move more and more towards breastmilk. <br>  <br>  Hope this is at least mostly impartial :P It does seem to be a subject that people just won't even listen to the other side on...|`|e6jrBORRaa	Well, it's hard not to tell you how good the colostrum is, but I'll try to restrain myself on that point.  ;-)  <br>  <br>  You should pump right away or you will dry up.  It happens so quickly.  I know this because I did dry up pretty quickly.  I had to pump because my son didn't have a good suck reflex.  I worked with the nursing experts in the hospital and he just wouldn't latch.  He would barely even suck the bottle.  I mixed the colostrum that I could express with the formula (there's an option for you to consider) and I tried to keep up the pumping at home, but it's not the same and I did dry up eventually.  Within a month, I didn't have any milk left, but I didn't stay on the schedule with the pumping.    <br>  <br>  I'd say in 2 days, you really won't have much milk left.  Even if you are formula feeding, if you do plan to express milk later, go ahead and pump to keep it going and have a good amount.  That's the other part:  If you don't keep it up, you really won't produce enough to feed your baby.  <br>  <br>  Oh, if you are going to pump, seriously look into renting the hospital grade equipment.  The Medela pumps you buy at the store are just not as good.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!  :-)|`|LhV8D2Xeaa	I wouldnt do that. You want to get the milk out or your breast will swell up huge and they will be hard as rocks.man it hurts so bad. i suggest directly feeding the baby for a few days then switching to the bottle.  Ya the baby will take the bottle if the milk taste differently. i breast fed for 13 months and i dont ever want to do it again. its painfull and it ruins your breast. my honest opinion is to just give them formula. it wont kill them|`|0VUZacRTaa	what i would suggest is to formula feed and also pump and feed the colostrum, that way your milk is going to come in. Do that until your milk comes in and then pump that instead of formula. any particular reason you dont want to just breastfeed?|`|jivtit0Eaa	My son wouldnt latch to my breast so I had to pump and I pumped all the colostrum no problem . The colostrum is suppose to be very good for the baby.So you will be fine pumping if that is what you wanna do.|`|zJ483z2kaa	Well, i think we all know that breastfeeding for the first few days would be best, but you already expressed you don't want too, so..<br>  I say try it. If the baby is hungry, it will drink either!|`|SNVauR3laa	Why are you so hesitant to breastfeed? I think once you see your baby, you may change your mind. I don't think that your milk will dry up if you don't breastfeed the first few days, because they don't get much the first few days, but when your milk does come in - if it does, I am sure that your supply will be compromised. I think that you do need to at least use the pump to stimulate production even if you don't plan on using the collostrum. I can't imagine why a pump would have trouble getting the collostrum out anyway. If you have a good one, it should not be a problem. I know that you are not looking for this opinion, but as a woman who both breastfeeds, and pumps, I've got to tell you that feeding her from the tap is much nicer than using the pump. She is more efficient than the pump, and it is a real time saver. Also, I don't have to worry about temperature of milk, or milk storage. If we are out and about, I don't have to worry about my milk letting down, because she is there to feed. <br>  <br>  Once you have your baby, I am sure that you may change your mind. The bonding that comes with breastfeeding is amazing. <br>  But if you don't just know that there is always a chance baby will get used to the formula taste. If she takes formula, then rejects your milk, try mixing the two, then increasing the amount of breast milk in the mixture until she is off formula. Good luck.|`|ROJans2Taa	in order for your milk supply to come in fully you really need to pump or breastfeed, im not an expert but I don't think your milk would come if you don't start stimulating it one way or another, my advice find a listing for a consultant to make sure, if you want to pump all the power to you, I did it when I had latching issues and I will say it's alot of work, trying to feed then pump, best luck|`|7d84621e89c49bcba037226d3361c90baa	In order to get your milk flowing properly, you do need to put your breasts to work. lol.  You can pump colostrum, but yes, you're not going to get very much.  When you pump the colostrum, give it to the baby.  It's the healthiest stuff out there for him.  You can give him that and formula, too.  Give every drop of what you're able to get to the baby.  Even just a little bit is really good for him.<br>  <br>  There are lactation specialists at the hospital who should be able to help you and tell you what to do.|`|eV7rtxmuaa	colostrum has nutrients that your baby would benefit from so I would suggest breastfeeding. Iv breast pumped exclusively for my daughter and i wouldn't recommend it. Breastfeeding from the breast is better for you & saves the hassle of washing and sterilizing all the bottles and equipment before and after each use.|`|bMvAmMTaaa	i think you should express for the first 2 days anyway and give baby as much as u can, i was told in the hospital that baby has maximum nutrition for the first 3 days after birth...hard to explain, but dont start on formula or you would have to stay on formula.|`|oA8Rtyxuaa	I don't think your milk would dry up since it doesnt really come in until a few days later but I would ask a lactation consultant. You might try to pump the colostrum, Im not sure if it would be to hard to pump.
bowLvYY4aa	..I have a 5 month old and I was a little apprehensive about breastfeeding as well. ...the thought of breastfeeding, an infant sucking on your nipple, I didnt have that much of a problem with, but most people are like "oh my gosh, how does it feel, its gotta be so wierd, I dont think I can do it" .. . and all's I say to those people is "you dont even realize it" .....and you really dont, you'll just forget about it. In the hospital, all the nurses were trying to help my son to latch on, and I thought I'd be all nervous and embarassed because I hated people seeing me naked, or vunerable in any way...and you really just forget all about it...breastfeeding is the best thing for you, and your baby. I gained 85 pounds during my pregancy and Ive been on a 10 pounds a month loss becuase of breastfeeding..you really do loose weight so much faster because your burning an extra 500 calories a day!! And my son, hasnt gotten sick once yet..and he's around sick people all the time!! ...his immunity because of breastfeeding is ridiculous, and Ive been sick!! And he hasnt gotten sick from me! and Im the one around him all the time! <br>  I am strickly breastfeeding..on the nights lets say, my husband and I have dinner plans, I have pumped milk in a bottle. Dont listen to what people say about the baby not latching on to the nipple or the bottle because he or she get confused...thats not true. In the beginning, its hard for them to take to the bottle nipple, they have no idea whats going on, its kidna funny...but stick with it, you express some milk on their lips so they get a taste of the milk, and they will eventually suck on the bottle. My son has been doing the bottle (with breastmilk) and straight from the nipple...with no problem..and he was SO hard to get to latch on, but the key, is persistance and not to quit. So many women quit breastfeeding becuase its too hard and frustrating, if youre willing to do it, you will!! <br>   It will get very tiring just pumping, I will tell you that much. In the beginning, I was pumping and feeding because I wanted to stock up on my breastmilk in the freezer, and it got tiring! VERY tiring. Its 20 minutes here, 20 minutes there...and then you have to actually feed the baby. Imagine that in the middle of the night at 2am, 4am, 6am..becuase that's what its going to be like..so one feeding at 2am..you will have to wake up, pump (even if you have milk already saved, your boobs will be killing you because they are full of milk, so you will have to pump), thats 20 minutes, then you have to feed the baby, thats another 20 minutes, then you have to burp, and change him, and get him back to sleep..by the time youre done, you'll be already awake for the 4am feeding...just telling you this so you can make it easier on yourself. <br>  As for feeding in public, i have strickly been breastfeeding, and not once have I had to feed in public. Not once. I've had to pump in public, and it was only a few times, in a bathroom stall..haha..not fun, but I always made sure I was going to places where id be comfortable pumping or feeding my baby. <br>  Good luck to you tho. Let me know if you have any other questions, hope this helped.|`|bf6fb0f4caadf24cfa826edc2cc32d3baa	You aren't annoying. <br>  <br>  Babies do fine with both the bottle and the breast.|`|AA10088149	Pumping milk is a lot more hassle than letting them breast feed...<br>  Although everyone is different once the baby is in your arms you might feel completely different ...I am amazed by what I will do for my children. Every so often I suddenly catch myself doing something that I would never have thought I would be able to do ...probably the worse thing I can think of is sucking the snot out of her nose when she was a few weeks old and really struggling with a blocked up nose in the middle of the night - yuk yuk yuk when I think of it now but at the time it was almost instinctive (and I guess I was half alsleep).  <br>  Try and let baby latch on as soon as possible after birth -when your feel good hormones should be sky high.<br>  Also don't worry too much about 'nipple confusion' - I was devasted when the hospital gave my second child a bottle of formula when she was only two days old -they said she was jumpy because I'd let her sleep too long and she wasn't strong enough to feed herself - afterwards I realised the jumpiness was probably because I had bought normal coffee instead of decaff (the packaging had changed and I got all confused!). On the way home I bought formula and bottles thinking she would never breast feed again - but as soon as we got home she started nuzzling in and never looked back - I have just stopped breast feeding her on her second birthday..and she isn't too happy about it!<br>  My first daughter had bottles every day at nursery from 12 weeks and breast fed upto 18 months..<br>  Finally feeding in public - you already have lots of good suggestions about cover ups and clothing - and if necessary going into a private place - but once you get a little practise, check yourself out in a mirror and see just how discreet it is -a friend of my partner once embarassed both of us by peering over the blanket and staring at the baby before, after several seconds, he realised what was going on!<br>  Also it is so convenient - no sterilising involved and you don't need to plan how long you will be out for or where you can heat a bottle -also perfect for night feeds...|`|ASVR6HHIaa	In the very begining that is true, if you give him a bottle he wont want to breastfeed because the bottle is so much easier. After about 6-8 weeks then you can do both. I have the same problem you do, I couldnt even hardly handle the thought of breastfeeding but after having 4 kids I can tell you, the baby feeding doesnt hurt as bad as the pump. It is actually less painful to let the baby feed. after the 2nd or 3rd day you get very sore but it goes away pretty fast and your nipples will toughen up and get completely used to it!!|`|DzPZ8EEkaa	I am NOT being sarcastic here ......but you should buy the book, "Breastfeeding for dummies."  I bought it myself because I am planning on trying to breastfeed my daughter.  I didn't BF with my first for MUCH of the same reasons you're stating in your question but I had a change of heart 3 weeks after he was born and it was already too late.  Anyway, I bought that book and it is really great.  It doesn't have all the sappy, it's so natural stuff but is more of a how-to and very straight forward.  Good luck!|`|HS6sFJPjaa	Stores sell cover ups that go over your shoulders and cover your chest area. The easiest way though is to slip the end of the baby's blanket through your bra strap and use the blanket to cover yourself. If the baby is latching on well after the first couple of weeks you can express milk and bottle feed without fear of "nipple confusion". My baby does both bottle (expressed milk) and breastfeed. He didn't like the bottle at first but after introducing it consistently (once a day), he became more use to it but still prefers the breast.|`|b99kfMPcaa	From my personal experience, my babies had no problem switching from bottle to breast, and going back and forth.  Just try to get a bottle that has the closest nipple to resemble your nipple.  As far as going out in public, breastfeeding is in and people are more open minded to the idea.  There are lots of cover-ups you can buy, or just use a blanket to drape over you while breastfeeding in public.  I've been shopping in the grocery store and walking down the isle with my son attached to my breast (covered up of course).  I've also gone into a public restroom and fed him there without having to worry about covering it up.  Just don't touch anything in there!  <br>  <br>  My best advice is to try breastfeeding your baby, and if you don't like it, then keep expressing as much milk as you can.  But if you do, only breastfeed at home, that way when you are out you can use the bottles.  Good luck and good job mom!|`|uCnmYEPBaa	I know babies who are comfortable with both breast and bottle.<br>  My son took both and had no problem, my daughter on the other hand wouldn't touch a bottle and finally was weaned at 14 months old.<br>  You can breastfeed in public, just carry a blanket to give you and baby privacy.<br>  It's a matter of choice on your part. But you CAN use both breast and bottle.|`|vue9NOhYaa	When you go out in public, ideally, you nurse your baby.  It's 100% possible to breastfeed discreetly, anywhere you happen to be.  You can wear normal clothing (2 piece outfits that allow you to lift your shirt from the waist) or, if you are more modest, you can toss a blanket over your shoulder or buy a special cover-up.<br>  <br>  If you opt to pump and give bottles in public, you can do that too. (Though if you're out for more than a few hours, you will get engorged and leaky.)  If that's your choice, then introduce a bottle at 4-6 weeks, so baby can learn to drink from a bottle and switch back and forth as needed. <br>  <br>  I would urge you to pick up (buy or get from the library) a couple of books about breastfeeding.  If you hope to succeed (whether you choose to nurse or exclusively pump) you really need a good grounding of information.|`|1270a2c558de1c5ce444bf6f3447f4beaa	Its good that you're thinking about this now and trying to gte prepared.  It increases your chances of being successful!<br>  <br>  as far as feeling weird, I thought I might too.  I don't at all.  I don't think about it really.  You'll be amazed at how much your child nursing will NOT feel weird when you actually do it.  You have the right frame of mind - give it a try and see how it goes.<br>  <br>  It is absolutely possible for a baby to both nurse and take a bottle.  My son is proof of that.  He takes a bottle or two of breast milk five days a week from his child care provider, and when I'm with him I nurse him.  He has no issues going back and forth at all.  I was told to wait until my son was three weeks old to introduce a bottle or a pacifier, to help make sure nursing is established.  That can help reduce confusion.  What i do is try to schedule around nursings, and if i can't, i make sure to bring a receiving blanket to use as a cover to give me some privacy.  I've headed out to my vehicle to nurse for privacy if I've been in a public place without anywhere I was comfortable.  As your baby gets older and goes loner in between feedings and has a moe regular schedule you'll be surprised how easy it will be for you to work around their feeding schedules.  It comes as second nature for me now!!<br>  <br>  Good luck and congrats on the new little one!!|`|4e67Pdfvaa	Ussually if you are in public, you find a descreet area to sit and feed the baby (covered up if possible)  Combo of bottle and breastfeeding is confusing for the baby.  You may thing right now that it is wierd or feels gross to have a baby latched on, but once you have the baby, this feeling will most likely change.  Its human nature... most likely nature will kick in.  Good luck<br>  <br>  ANd I have NO idea what i said was soo controversial to get a thumbs down?? I successfully breastfed my 3 kids, what i say is from experience.|`|FLpMShKNaa	Babies can switch from breast to bottle, just wait a couple weeks to offer a bottle-my son always preferred the breast-you won't be up for going out much then anyhow. I was like you I thought nursing would be awful, but after struggling the first few days it was actually easy and even relaxing. You are free to nurse in public, but I usually just found a secluded place to go, like a ladies restroom with a lounge. It wasn't as much of a worry as I thought. Don;t feel bad for asking questions-I could never have breastfed if I didn't have a lot of help early on.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	Most moms nurse when they are out, if you are ...err shy for lack of a better word you can nurse in family rooms, dressing rooms, your car, or even the bathroom -if that's what it takes to feel comfortable.  There is also the "hooter hider", shawls, blankets and the "slurp 'n' burp", nursing tops, etc etc.<br>  <br>  You can use a cup to feed expressed milk, this is done for infants with latching problems.  Cups (or paladais if available are better) don't cause nipple confusion and they don't increase the risks of ear infections.<br>  <br>  Many moms do use bottles with out serious problems if they start after 6 weeks.  Some don't, nipple "confusion" can occur at any age.<br>  <br>  Many articles on nipple confusion:<br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/bf/start/concerns/pacifier.html#confusion" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/bf/start/concern...</a>|`|6hA0O06xaa	you can do breast and bottle.  I did.  But with one caveat, you shouldn't try and introduce a bottle until breastfeeding is well established, like 4-6 weeks.  By that time your baby should be a pro at nursing and a new nipple (bottle nipple) can be introduced with less chance of nipple confusion or your baby then prefering the bottle and refusing to learn how to nurse efficiently.<br>  <br>  If you can last the month or so without being away from your baby or home for more than an hour or two, then you can introduce the bottle.  <br>  <br>  Pumping is a pain if you are also nursing because you can't pump right after you feed (barely any milk left) or close to a time when your baby might want to nurse (they'll get frustrated and cry when the milk isn't flowing as fast as they'd like because you took the "let-down gush" when you pumped).  You have to time it right and when they're nursing every 2 hours round the clock and need to be held the rest of teh time, it's hard to find a 15+ minute break.<br>  <br>  So basically, I just always topped my son off before we left the house, even if he had just nursed 30 minutes earlier.  This way I was confident we'd get back home before he'd be hungry (and he was more likely to sleep peacefully the whole time we were out).  "topping off" worked for about 4 months.  Then he wouldn't nurse unless he was due to anyway so I had to juggle leaving the house a bit more.  But also by then he was really good at nursing and I didn't need a pillow for support or anything, so I would just bring a nursing cover and do it in hthe car or a quiet park bench if needed.|`|BtxQogSzaa	Don't panic!<br>  I think its lovely you want to breast feed, and everyone has these fears! I always said i wouldn't breast feed for the reason i hate my breasts! But once i had a chat to my mum and realised its a lovely way to bond with the baby, i came round to the idea. I personally don't think for a first time mum anyone knows what to expect with breast feeding.<br>  Firstly you will be shown how to do so by the midwife after having your baby. you can practise with a doll bgut nothings the same as doing it with you own baby. then once you have been shown how you are 'meant' to do it you will sopon find a way that you and your baby feel comfortable to do so.<br>  First off do the breast feeding with your nipple, you'll find it harder to express milk in the early days anyhow, so just see how it goes. second, you must only do what you want, we can advise you but NO one should tell you you should do it this way or that way only YOU can make that desission. <br>  With the feeding in public issue...well theres lots of options, you can feed you baby where you want...i myself would feed on a park bench if my baby was hungery i didnt think twice to feed him....i would latch him on and put a blanket over, so no one actually knew what i was doing, only me and my baby. It just looked like i was giving him a cuddle...of course you'll always find the snooty people who will shake their head in discuss, but stuff them...breast feeding is the natural thing in the world!...or of course you can express some milk and feed your baby that way....<br>  <br>  Seriously don't worry about it! Once you have your baby you will find that its easier to choose or find out if you feel happy to breast feed.<br>  <br>  But good on you for trying, and remember your midwife is there to be asked about all these things, she should be able to help you with everythign you need to know...<br>  Good luck with the baby and i hope ive helped you in someway :)|`|LhV8D2Xeaa	A baby can learn to use the breast on the bottle. At first it is hard for them because they get nipple confusion but eventually that goes away. Also if you want to just breast feed go in the bathroom or get this breast feeding sling wear you cant see the baby nursing. Buy nursing bras and nursing tank tops. Also you will need breast pads and lanolin for the sore nipples. If your breast ever get sore from feeding use a ice pac first.(frozen wet diaper works great). Dont feel uncomfortable about the baby suckling its natural its not like you doing something wrong|`|PNPg9Ytkaa	I don't know about the other moms opinions but if you were planning on pumping it is MUCH more awkward than a baby being latched on to your nipple.. it tugs much harder and actually gets less milk... just thoughts for you... not all babies have a hard transition  my babys doctor suggest I wait to introduce a bottle until 6 weeks so she doesn't get that nipple confusion and would hopefully prevent her from not wanting to return to the breast.. Not all babies have that problem but its a very common one... Just my opinion and what works best for my family (I'm a full time on campus student) is to breastfeed when I'm able and then pump only when needed when I can't breastfeed (If I'm in class or whatnot)<br>  <br>  Good luck! I hope you find what works best for you and your family|`|WPI0Z47saa	With a lot of babies they get nipple confusion if you do both breast and bottle at the same time early on. It is harder for a baby to draw milk from the breast and requires them to work harder. Bottles flow more easily so that they don't have to work to hard. That being said, if you offer a baby both in the beginning before they are used to working to get their food, they will more likely choose the easier way and turn down the breast. So it is usually not recommended that you give your baby a bottle before they are well established with breastfeeding which is very tricky to both the mother and baby in the first several weeks sometimes a couple of months. Some babies do fine from the beginning with both but that is a risk. If you are in public then you just need to feed your baby when they are hungry. You can buy a breastfeeding shawl or cover up with a blanket. You could also go back to your car if you have it with you or try your best to plan your errands around the baby's feeding schedule. As far as feeling funny having a baby suck on you nipple, if you never did it before then yes it sounds weird and a lot of things run through your head about how strange it may feel, but n reality when it actually happens, it is totally different. They hurt a little in the beginning but you don't really get any sensations. Your nipples will roughen up and you won't really feel much of anything. You will be so involved with your new baby and so amazed by them that you won't think strangely about it. It will become natural. Hope this was helpful.|`|gEyCvH1kaa	well my experience from breastffeding was that i started out giving him formula at first because i felt like nothing was coming out of my breast the first couple of days and i was very scared of my baby having malnutrition because he started out only 5 pounds. so anyway a few days later my milk came in and that's when i started breastfeeding and at first i did have a hard time gettign him to latch on.. he looked at my breast like what the heck is this but within 1 or 2 days he latched on well but still didnt seem full so i supplimented with formula and he took the bottle comfortably with no confusion. if in public and ur baby doesnt take bottle, then like everyone says a blanket over is good. good luck =] i hope ull stick to breastfeeding because it was very fustrating for me.. and i made the mistake of giving him formula so i never made enough milk.. and eventually had to go to formula completely|`|oUcLSDZ6aa	My daughter had breast and bottle, as did my Godson, and my daughters best friend. And we never had any problems. My daughter actually had bottle before breast. <br>  <br>  As for public... most public facilities have "family rooms", specifically designed for nursing mother. <br>  <br>  When the time comes, and you are actually faced with feeding your child, you'll do what's right for you, and your baby, no sense in worrying about it now, everything changes once you hold your baby for the first time. <br>  <br>  If you are going to try boobs and bottles, pick a bottle that is designed to feel, and flow like a breast. There are a lot of bottles that are designed to imitate the breasts. And as for your concern about not going back to the breast after having a bottle, a lot of people have the opposite problem, and their babies won't take a bottle after being on the breast, making it stressful for mommy to try and get out every once in a while. <br>  <br>  You'll figure it all out though. Plus there will be lactation consultants at the hospital that will help you figure out a routine that works for you and your baby. <br>  <br>  Congrats!|`|rdpZrBc9aa	For a while you pretty much don't go out in public, because the baby's too young.  You probably won't feel much like it anyway for a week or two!  Wait a few weeks, like maybe a month, before you start the bottle.  Let the baby get nursing firmly established first.  <br>  <br>  When you do go out in public, very often there are places you can nurse discreetly.  I do most of my shopping at a Super Wal-Mart, so I just went to the dressing room when we needed to nurse.  My son found the other baby in the mirrors fascinating!  I always wait until the end of my shopping anyway to get the frozen foods and milk.  Just take a blankie with you for privacy.<br>  <br>  You may also want to consider using formula for the times when it's not really convenient to nurse.  Church and football games come to mind.  I did that by putting enough powdered formula in the bottles to make up 4-oz amounts, then using bottled water. <br>  <br>  Pumping can work, and I actually know a woman who fed her son entirely with breast milk in bottles, but pumping is MUCH less efficient than nursing, and less comfortable.  I promise nursing is much easier.<br>  <br>  Talk to the lactation specialist at your hospital.  They may even have breastfeeding classes.  Good luck!
f4zg7LHLaa	well as you're from the UK, i'd say Bonjela. that coupled with calpol if she is having a really tough time. Reece just popped through his 1st tooth, and is having trouble with another atm, and we've been giving calpol and bonjela. <br>  you could use the teether things, but we have this stick thing with a rubber biting bit on the end. got it in a set from mothercare before he was born, and it is actually a godsend! :)|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	My second can't take acetaminophen,  I don't know if its a true allergy or what but usually before he finishes taking the whole dose it all comes up, and it always all comes back within 15 minutes.<br>  <br>  I have broken out all the "old" remedies.<br>  1/4-1/2tsp of table sugar works great<br>  <br>  Rub children's or infant's tylenol (remember children is more dilute) directly on the area.

DNygQdmVaa	My son will be 15 months on the 11th,<br>  he has 7 full teeth, 4 on top 3 on bottom. and 1 more coming in on the bottom.|`|0wTzlG2haa	Our twins both had slightly more than 8 teeth at that age. Probably between 10 and 14 or so each. Essentially they both had almost eveything except the molars that come in later. Don't worry about the gaps that you might see. The dentist told us that it's kind of a good thing if toddlers have some gaps between their teeth now. Adult teeth are larger and having the gaps with the baby teeth means that there is room for those teeth to move in.|`|MxhNzW7Oaa	My son is 15 months and has 11 teeth with the 12th one coming in any day now (the last of his 4 molars).<br>  <br>  He had 8 teeth at 12 months and the other 4 have come in VERY slowly these past 3 months.<br>  <br>  ETA: It's completely normal for that gap to be there. When the rest of his teeth come in, it will close that gap. My oldest had that and he the gap closed when the rest of his teeth came in and my youngest still has a gap (because he still has more teeth to come!)|`|WtTUNC8Naa	The might straighten out, that is something you should bring up at your baby's next pediatrician appointment. My son at his 1 (3 months ago) year check up had a full set of teeth. He started teething when he was 2 1/2 months old, and by the time he was 3 1/2 months old he had sprouted two teeth (the upper two front teeth). Ever since then he has always been constantly teething, and his teeth always came in, in pairs (2 at a time).|`|LhV8D2Xeaa	its good that kids have a gap because it means they have extra room in their moth when other teeth come in. they are meant to be gapped all my sons front teeth are. when i was younger i had a gap but i dont anymore|`|oA8Rtyxuaa	They might straighten out, they might not, just remember that baby teeth have nothing to do with how straight or not straight the permanent teeth come in!|`|29I3YjjPaa	ha my monster is the same he has a mouth full of teeth and he has a gap between his front ones nothing huge just a lil one my dentist said that they will close when all his teeth get into place and that even if they don't straighten out remember there baby teeth and that his permanent ones might not be like that!|`|tx8OTfFUaa	My 9 month old has 6 full teeth, two on bottom, four on top!
4IVWMgp7aa	I would have pronounced it Jah Na, not Jay Na... Knew a girl with that name once.|`|TCpPdqcBaa	Hmm... If you like that pronounciation, maybe you should spell it differently. Jana would be pronounced Jan-nah. <br>  <br>  <br>  Maybe Jayna, Jaina, or Jaena...<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|dd8cb229ee241de8ca385f84ec4b33d7aa	Yes, I think it's very Pretty<br>  <br>  Jana is a beautiful name|`|igvUbqkyaa	I prefer it pronounced like Hannah but with a J. I don't like it Jay-Na. But pronounced the other way it is okay.

IRFbj0G9aa	I had dark brown spotting in my first pregnancy as well, it didn't last as long but this is what I was told: That usually dark brown is not a bad sign that it is probably from implantation of the embryo.  At least that is what they told me with my pregnancy, mine happened if I remember correctly in my second month, just after we confirmed a heart beat with our first ultrasound.  And to be on the safe side I was given progesterone pills for a couple of days.  I wouldn't freak, but I most certainly would not ignore it.  In my opinion when you see blood whatever shade it may be the safest and most prudent thing to do is contact your obstetrician immediately.|`|fUK9y3Qkaa	I have had the same thing for a week! But i also have cramping.......|`|FsFUo4VJaa	Left  over blood I had it too dont worry about it.|`|9osFXKPyaa	I WANT TO KNOW THE SAME THING|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Brown bleed = old blood. I would ask your doctor about it when you go in for your confirmation and first appointment as long as it doesn't continue for more than a week or doesn't get heavier or more red.|`|nwHqblWiaa	Definitely don't want to scare you..I had dark brown spotting for about 3-4 days before my miscarriage started. I found I was pregnant on a Tuesday and the spotting started on Friday.. ;[ It's definitely smtg you should bring to your doctors attention..and try to rest and take it easy for the next couple days or so. Good luck sweetie.|`|GZn5VNlSaa	If you're early on, like 5 weeks and under, it could be implantation bleeding. Or it could be a mild period. Some women do get periods while pregnant.|`|sVPToYvKaa	I know this doesn't answer your question, but I am due November 1st.<br>  1st Child on the way :)<br>  <br>  I'd like to chat cause our due dates are close together!<br>  <br>  caramelx3x3@yahoo.com|`|Hu9yquP4aa	I get that same spotting the day after sex.|`|vGHaYp6Naa	i think as long as its not like a full on period, you should be fine. just call and ask your doctor
pXSKSS3daa	Naked ones are my favorite(of my son, of course!), I also like catching him when he isn't looking at the camera. I have one of him while not looking and his on his belly in the grass. Oh, and I like when his back is turns towards me but he's turning his head to look at me. And then I also like taking pictures of just his feet or hands.|`|tapFZBowaa	Maybe looking at someone off camera and catching a smile?|`|ASVR6HHIaa	My kids have lots of black and white photos, those are my favorite, not sure what age your baby is but black and white bathtub pics are adorable, and my son got his pics taken when he was 6 months and they laid him on the table in nothing but a diaper and he was on his back and grabbed both his feet, it is adorable!!|`|FTFd3AQAaa	we really need a bit more info to answer this appropriatly... how old is your daughter? can she sit/stand? does she hold objects... that kind of thing
ibeYAlwpaa	I LOVE dr. Browns bottles. The problem withWith them is that there is several pieces to make up one bottle. && if you happen to have other bottles the pieces do not interchange and cause leakage. They will also leak if the tan piece is missing from the bottle (if you try to just put the lid on without it it will most defly leak everywhere.) It comes with a little brush to clean the clear tube and brown piece which can be a pain making simple bottle washing even more annoying….lol…. wow that doesn’t sound much like I like them, but really I do!! My little girl was not a gassy baby and I attribute that partially to the bottles! She also refused to burp for the most part and her tummy didn’t get upset and I think the bottles helped.<br>  <br>  I fully plan on using them again for this baby!!|`|KyFCYs0Yaa	I know some people swear by them, but I have always had trouble with them leaking. I have experience with many different types of bottles. I worked in the infant room in a daycare for about 5 years, and I think for gas, playtex vent air bottles are great! The vent in the bottom of the bottle  lets the air come in through the bottom, eliminating the bubbles that go through the milk when the baby sucks. although recently, I have read about the markings washing off of these.<br>  I have ALWAYS had trouble with leaks when using Dr. Browns. <br>  Good Luck, and I hope your little girl isn't gassy at all! :) Congratulations by the way.|`|tk2AOZU5aa	I think you would be wasting your money with these bottles. Really any bottle will work. These claim to make your baby less gassy, but really baby's have gas and colic in relation to the formula, and acid reflux is due to immaturity of the cardiac sphincter of the stomach and resolves over time. Good burping, and sometimes the use of Mylicon drops works best for gassiness. If you are looking at buying bottles though, I would suggest ones with disposable liners as they do not collect bacteria over time, and it is like having a brand new bottle with each feeding. <br>  Congratulations!|`|LY2LSzPJaa	I hate them ! alot of friends of mine love em but I never liked em plus you pay to much, for both children I used to vent air , I loved them and they are easy to clean , they come completely apart , bottom to top , they are awesome. <br>  When they are older like 6+ month maybe younger ( when they want to hold it them selfs) get the Ansa easy hold bottles , they are the circular type ones I guess , they have a whole in the middle they are hard to find but google it , they are cheap I got 8bottles and 4sippy cups for $25 and they come in all different colors. ( change the nipples though) <br>  Dr, Browns are hard to clean and they leak I do not recomend them. Like I said Vent Airs are great for new borns and it does the same things dr. browns does , prevents air!|`|D9oFLRdwaa	I started using these bottles for my son when he was around 5mos after using avent bottles. They were highly recommended by friends that their children had acid reflux and bad gas. They really do help he still kind of uses them and he is 15mos now. He had really bad gas even after changing him over to soy which we realized was due to the air in the bottles. They do leak if you shake them or fill them too much and they are sort of tedious when it comes to washing them because of all the parts but I would definitely recommend them they are great bottles. I hope this helps|`|Oq2B7I4faa	Even I wanted to know the answer for you question.  I just bought Dr. browns glass bottle last week and even though they very expensive my husband wanted me to get those because  I am planning to warm the water in the microwave to make formula and my husband says since it's BAP free and glass bottle there won't be any harm to the baby.  With my first daughter I bought playtex vent air bottles and I really love those but this time we want to try the glass bottle.|`|Ojgqd4xNaa	I thought they helped a ton with my daughter.  And I've had no problems with them leaking.  Once or twice if they were filled too much, or I stupid loosened the cap too much, but that's it.  The only thing I hate is having to wash all the pieces.  I'm very anal about how they're  washed, so it takes forever.  I tried to switch to different bottle, my little girl is 5 months, but I still think I need to wait a little while longer.  Just because you your first one had bad gas, and reflux doesn't mean this one will.  You might want to try easier to deal with ones, like the drop-ins first, and then if your daughter does need them go out and get them.  Just get a couple of the Playtex Drop-in ones to start.  I love the Dr. Browns, but they are a pain, and if they aren't necessary, then it's not worth all the aggravation of washing them all.<br>  <br>  Good Luck, and Congratulations on your new bundle!!|`|ccd9bacbf1ad616406e98ebf61adc6dcaa	My first daughter had reflux, and the Dr. Brown's bottles helped her immensely. They did leak (but not a lot), and they are a pain in the neck to clean, but she didn't spit up as much, and she was easier to burp. I've also heard good things about Playtex Vent-Aire, but I haven't tried them myself.|`|7bdhpvc9aa	I one of those who swear by them. We never had gas problems with our son. They never leaked. They come with leak stoppers if the bottle is already filled up and you want to take it in the diaper bag just put one of the leak stoppers on them and off you go. The only thing that I could see wrong with thenm which didn't bother me was that they have more pieces to the bottle than other bottles. More pieces means more cleaning time which doesn't really matter if your baby is doing good on them. All in all they worked great for us.|`|215dfe0c283eb141a2ed0b4dcb32274caa	I used them with both of my children and have no complaints. I pumped my milk exclusively and bottle feed them and neither had problems with gas. The only thing I disliked about them is how difficult they are to clean. I never had any leaking problems. I am going to try the playtex drop-ins bottle system this time around as it seems pretty easy!|`|ME62Mtv4aa	they were ok at first but started to leak and they are a pain in the butt to clean|`|QOvUS6xVaa	i tried it and it leaked,, i never bough one again,, i use drop ins
q4tTabfjaa	Keep a brightly coloured bag special for Michael's needs only and have it ready before you start packing and make sure you always know where it is.<br>  In that bag, the must haves are all those special toys, Michael's nappies for the move, feeds etc. and something new too.<br>  I would even tie on some bright ribbons and pieces of material that make it the special move bag.  Michael may remember it at a later date in his 20's perhaps with affection (after he has used it as the special crayons and paper bag etc...).<br>  I do not agree that the room should be the same as the old one, but do agree with sticking to Michael's routine needs (times he eats, bedtime etc).  I remember as a child moving into a different house and remember seeing this strange orange and brown wallpaper and picking daisies (my sister told me that the wallpaper I was describing was in the house we moved into and it was covered over shortly after we moved, I was less than 2 years old).<br>  Maybe that is why I am not fazed by change, because they made it an adventure and there was a lot of smiling faces.|`|OD3FqMaKaa	try to lay out his room in the new house the same as it is in your flat then if he wakes up he will see the same familiar things around and he hopefully wont notice he is in a different room<br>  <br>  keep to a routine the same as now as that reinforces to him that nothing has changed|`|614b1b4d6af3f9c82b8515ac1f60f2fbaa	We were lucky and able to leave our little girl at my mum's for two nights while we decorated the room in exactly the same way as her old room was decorated.  Her room was laid out differently as the room was differently but decorating it the same helps if you have that choice and we took her to the house a couple of times before we moved so that it wasn't completely alien to her- she was only 13 months.  We had no massive problems with her and the move and still think it was down to this.
XlhBBZPxaa	well it will be a change but just talk to your little man and start explaining what will be taking place he will understand maybe not in words but your facial expression should make it ok for him|`|uP08b6K4aa	If at all possible, it might be a good idea if you could have a relative to care for him whilst you move all the furniture from one place to the next simply because it's hard enough work shifting all that stuff without having to worry about the baby getting agitated, and if you get uptight, so will he making the whole move harder than what it already was.<br>  <br>  Children change to suit their environment so I really wouldn't worry about him being unsettled for perhaps the first couple of nights, he'll soon get used to his new surroundings and provided you make it as comfortable as possible, you can't go wrong.  Make sure to have a great big smile on your face perhaps when you carry him into his room pointing out all the nice new things, or the paint on the walls, he'll pick up on your happiness and copy you.<br>  <br>  You could perhaps take him to your new home and show him around before you move your things in so he can relate a little to it then give him a big surprise when everything is in place, I'm sure he'll be just as excited as you are.<br>  <br>  Good Luck with the move and I hope you'll all be very happy in your new home x
LIVkGLa5aa	Its just your ligaments all stretching to allow for the growing womb chick!  Cograts on the baby and by that heart beat I recon its a girl! xxxx|`|B6Mfx5fUaa	I'm 17 weeks and have been experiencing what sounds like the same "pinching feeling" for quite some time now.  I believe it's just your body making room for baby.  Just stretching and all that other fun stuff.  Best of luck to you!|`|yKS2UI87aa	Your baby bump will be getting bigger. It sounds like your skin is stretching. I got that when I was about 10-15 weeks and then down the right side of my stomach at about 6-8 months.--He liked my right side I always looked lopsided.|`|kbIkVS0raa	I had that and my doctor said it was my belly getting ready to stretch and grow. No worries you will feel a lot of that from this point on lol good luck and congrats|`|OuuYoSBeaa	this is most likely just your body/uterus stretching and growing. During pregnancies you will find alot of differnet feelings, cramps etc that are all completely normal and just your body changing with the pregnancy.|`|QSodlfMraa	that is your uterus making way for your baby by 12 to 13 weeks the baby will be in your pelvis.<br>  <br>  congrats:)
sEihaeLNaa	try the blending the banana with ice a lil bit of sugar and Nestle quick, my son hates milk but he loves that. also try blending frozen strawberries with a lil bit of sugar. top them both of with Cinnamon. If that fails you are going to have to buy some Omega 3 liquid vitamins and put some in her juice. It is very good for kids.|`|nQyJFOMZaa	Umm maybe mix it with the formula she used to drink(or breast milk) whatever you have been giving her and slowly make it all milk. Maybe that might help. <br>  I.E= mix up the formula like usual and then add like .5-1oz of milk so she gradually gets used to the taste. Or the same with breast milk|`|oA8Rtyxuaa	maybe she just doesn't like it? I wouldn't worry about it too much, just make sure she gets her calcium from other sources and mention it to your doctor. No need to rush her to the doc in my opinion though!|`|7rCeCVl2aa	When it comes to things like this I am pretty firm with my kids. You eat or drink what I give you or you get nothing else. It may sound harsh but my kids are not picky eaters now so it has worked very well.<br>  <br>  The way *I* would fix this is offer him the milk and nothing else. If he is thirsty he'll drink it.<br>  <br>  <br>  Another option is ask the doctor if you can give him calcium supplements.|`|uCnmYEPBaa	My daughter wouldn't drink milk at that age either. She is 5 now and still prefers to drink water over anything else.<br>  When she asks for it, I give it to her, but if she doesn't, I don't try to force it on her.<br>  She may not like the taste. Have you tried whole, 2% and 1%?<br>  Maybe the whole is too thick, get a half gallon of the others and see if it makes a difference. If not, don't worry about it. Make sure she eats cheese and yogurt if you are concerned about the calcium intake.
3X0t8JrXaa	Yes its possible...my OBGYN said on average it takes 3 months for bcp to get out of your system.  I stopped mine (after 10 years) and 3 months later I was pregnant.  For me 5 days after a missed period I got a false negative...3 days later I got a positive.  I'd personally wait a week...so for you maybe test on the 6th or 7th.  Good luck to you!|`|SR0hYSqGaa	If youhad unprotected sex you could be pregnant - full stop.  Will it show on a test yet - probably yes as they are very sensitive now.|`|uFrqC4Y2aa	No you can take a test now! Good luck!!|`|0756dc620f7e85830cd5e318d021d602aa	The pill gets out of your system VERY fast so you very well could be. Its posible you are a few weeks pregnant.|`|7d84621e89c49bcba037226d3361c90baa	If you missed your period, then it's not too soon to test.  Go take one.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|rNYddVHxaa	Paps meres doesn't stop your period from coming so there is a chance that you can be pregnant. I would go ahead and take test, you have already missed your period so it is not too early. Good Luck!|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Take a test. It's the only way to know and it should have been enough time.
yB5go5wbaa	The sharp pains are not braxton hicks (unless you feel your whole belly bump tightening up while the pain is happening).  It's your cervix thinning out.  That happened to me and would it stop me in my tracks sometimes.  My bet is at your next appointment, you'll be somewhat effaced or dilated.  It's normal and nothing to worry about unless it starts getting more frequent and is accompanied by fluid leaking or blood.  You're close though, momma, good luck and hang in there!|`|eu6UQElYaa	Sounds like you are getting muscle spasms and braxton hicks contractions.   That's normal this far along.|`|ROJans2Taa	I had that a few days before I went into labor, in my opinion I think your body's preparing itself, I would guess your going to be going into labor within at least the next week, I could be way off, just my experience, if the baby engaged it could explain less movement, best wishes|`|eDmdkUO3aa	The cramping are Braxton hicks contractions. If you were active today, that is likely why you didn't feel anything. If you have a device to hear the heartbeat, why not check it again?????|`|yKS2UI87aa	The pain could be from too much running around or Braxton Hicks. I would sit down for an hour and count how many times you feel the baby move. 10 x or more per hour is normal.|`|rdpZrBc9aa	Are you timing these pains?|`|qMYbGqiwaa	Babies movements slow down during the last couple weeks, they are just too cramped up to move.  Also the period like cramping sounds like contractions, at least thats what my contractions felt like.  It sounds like you are close to the end- good luck!
mf3OOagMaa	Yes, being under severe stress can cause a miscarriage - do I think that you had one - no.<br>  The dizziness was likely caused from not breathing right - you were crying a lot, which means that you were not getting enough oxygen. If you noticed any blood, then yes, I might be more inclined to think that you had a miscarriage. However, even though most spontaneous abortions (that is what it is called) occur unnoticed, I still do not believe that you had one.<br>  It takes a lot of stress / duress to affect the body that severely - 20 minutes of crying is likely not to have made any differenence other that worry you. I would try to avoid the source of this stress - because on many levels, not just for the baby - it is not a healthy thing to be around.<br>  I am glad that you have a doc appointment today - they can reassure you that everything is okay and if you "let them in" - can refer you to someone that you can talk to about the things that are upsetting you: these folks can help teach you relaxation techniques and tools for dealing with the stress in your life. You are not alone - let others help you!|`|4VDWKHX3aa	For the first 3 months of my pregnancy, I cried almost EVERYDAY because the father didn't want the baby and kept telling me to get an abortion. I work two jobs, couldn't focus, was sad, mad, jealous, emotional... ALL the things you can think of. I was strong to finally just get it out of my mind. I am now 5 months pregnant with a healthy baby. I have my u/s next week and I'll know what I'm having. The dad finally came through and accept the baby but of course, I wont forget how he didn't want it. 20 minutes of crying won't do any harm.|`|KNxs4PrZaa	you will be just fine.  excessive stress and emotional upset throughout your pregnancy can have negative effects on the pregnancy however a few good crying breakdowns are not the end of the world. part of pregnancy is the emotions that come with it, i was all over the place emotionally at the beginning of my pregnancy and cried alot and eveything was fine. next time you feel yourself getting that upset try to distract yourself by going for a walk or taking a bath so you dont get so upset. but dont worry one heavy crying isnt going to harm an otherwise healthy pregnancy.|`|yKS2UI87aa	First Trimester miscarriages usually are due to chromosomal defects, not anything the mother did. Emotions run high while pregnant but try and not let them run away totally. I think you'll be fine but if you start to cry again (which you probably will), remember to breathe normally so not to cut off any oxygen to the baby.|`|7rIAd6gGaa	I'm sure you're fine. I am a very emotional person, and when I'm pregnant it gets crazy. Several times during my pregnancy with my daughter and this one I had crying fits where I pretty much got hysterical, couldn't control my breathing, etc. I did not miscarry. Crying can't hurt the baby. Stress affects you, which could in turn affect the baby (if you don't eat right, take care of yourself, etc) but it's not going to cause a miscarriage. Try not to worry. Those hormones can really do a number on you!!|`|Y1Lb5f4Eaa	Gosh I hope not, because I've cried for like two hours straight once since I've been pregnant. If you're really concerned ask your doctor, but I think you're probably ok.|`|rUC7WHLVaa	I think you will be fine..crying is good, its stress that is not good! I bawled like a baby while I was preggo for no reason..Just try to not stress and you will be fine.|`|dRo89MsYaa	i don't think getting too emotional will cause the baby harm. I tend to cry a lot. It's part of being pregnant. :)|`|d3jtRA8caa	If that's true then I should have lost my baby a long time ago. No, but if you stress yourself out then you have a chance to lose it. But usually crying releases stress.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	No. :) A lot of pregnant women get emotional like that and are fine. The doctor will tell you the same thing but make sure you bring it up so that you are worried about it later as well.|`|ROJans2Taa	I was an emotional wreck during my last pregnancy I had experienced a miscarriage 4 mths prior and then started to cramp and bleed around 5 weeks, I would sit on my bathroom floor with the door shut and just bawl my eyes out, I was so convinced I was losing this baby too, I couldn't think straight it hurt so bad, turns out my baby was fine, he is 6 mths now, they say stress isn't good for any pregnancy, but I haven't known any moms yet that never had stress while pregnant, my sister was pregnant during the time my dad received the news he had cancer, he died 3 mths later, all during her second trimester, needless to say it was an extremely stressful time. try not to let things eat at you, im sure though your baby is fine best luck|`|eV7rtxmuaa	Being emotional during pregnancy is very normal.

w4zjmhxoaa	My son's was like that when he was around 8-10 months old.  It's not a bad thing!  I think it has to do with eating too much beta carotene.  Does she like sweet potatoes, mangos, carrots, bananas, etc?  I googled this when my son had the same problem.  I forget the entire list of foods high in beta carotene, but it's long!  Just try to vary her diet a little more and it should go away|`|17cd02c243ad95cd0a7ac5eee0305905aa	My sons was the same way, it just went away after we got a new camera.

No worries... my son's nose did this too.  I think it was the lighting.  A jaundiced child will have yellowing skin and eyes.  If you're worried, bring it up with the doc, but I assure you, it's probably just the lighting.|`|b7Z3OSRwaa	talk to the doctor.  May be some jaundice.
LhV8D2Xeaa	i started around like 6 months strt of with fruits and steamed veggies. and if the baby has teeth their ready to chew. and they naturally know how to chew on their own. stay away from grapes hotdogs and corn these are known baby chokers. also you can feed him like chunked up meats.( small pieces) And if the new food causes constipation apple juice is always good|`|ld14iRCeaa	you can start when u feel comfortable. both my girls hated baby food. i have an 8 month old who has been eating table food for weeks. just mush it up or cut it into tiny pieces and feed slowly. but to be more official, gerber says that when a child can crawl, stomach off the floor and can grasp food between the thumb and pointer finger and lift it to their mouth, they are ready for starter food.) good luck!|`|tx8OTfFUaa	We just took our 9 month old to the Dr. today and he said he wants him to eat as much puree as he would take and to start food that has "lumps".

However, there is good reason to believe that babies are at less risk of choking if they are in control of what goes into their mouth than if they are spoon fed. This is because babies are not capable of intentionally moving food to the back of their throats until after they have developed the ability to chew. And they do not develop the ability to chew until after they have developed the ability to reach out and grab things. The ability to pick up very small things develops later still. Thus, a very young baby cannot easily put himself at risk because he cannot get small pieces of food into his mouth. Spoon feeding, by contrast, encourages the baby to suck the food straight to the back of his mouth, potentially making choking more likely.<br>  <br>  [...]<br>  <br>  General principles of good nutrition for children apply equally to young babies who are managing their own introduction to solid foods. Thus, 'fast foods' and foods with added sugar and salt should be avoided. However, once a baby is over six months old there is no need (unless there is a family history of allergy or a known or suspected digestive disorder) to otherwise restrict the foods that the baby can be offered. Fruit and vegetables are ideal, with harder foods cooked lightly so that they are soft enough to be chewed. At first, meat is best offered as a large piece, to be explored and sucked; once the baby can manage to pick up and release fistfuls of food, minced meat works well. (Note: babies do not need teeth to bite and chew – gums do very well!)<br>  <br>  There is no need to cut food into mouth-sized pieces. Indeed, this will make it difficult for a young baby to handle. A good guide to the size and shape needed is the size of the baby's fist, with one important extra factor to bear in mind: Young babies cannot open their fist on purpose to release things. This means that they do best with food that is chip-shaped or has a built-in 'handle' (like the stalk of a piece of broccoli). They can then chew the bit that is sticking out of their fist and drop the rest later – usually while reaching for the next interesting-looking piece. As their skills improve, less food will be dropped.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9646449" rel="nofollow">http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9646449</a><br>  Parents elsewhere in the world certainly take a more freewheeling approach, often starting babies on heartier, more flavorful fare — from meats in African countries to fish and radishes in Japan and artichokes and tomatoes in France.<br>  <br>  The difference is cultural, not scientific, says Dr. Jatinder Bhatia, a member of the American Academy of Pediatrics' nutrition committee who says the American approach suffers from a Western bias that fails to reflect the nation's ethnic diversity.<br>  <br>  Bhatia says he hopes his group soon will address not only that, but also ways to better educate parents about which rules must be followed and which ones are only suggestions.<br>  <br>  [...]<br>  <br>  Rayya Azarbeygui, a 35-year-old Lebanese immigrant living in New York, isn't waiting. After her son was born last year, she decided he should eat the same foods she does — heavily seasoned Middle Eastern dishes like hummus and baba ghanoush.<br>  <br>  "My pediatrician thinks I'm completely crazy," says Azarbeygui, whose son is now 13 months old. "But you know, he sees my child thriving and so says, 'You know what, children in India eat like that. Why not yours?'"<br>  <br>  How to introduce healthy children to solid food has rarely been studied. Even the federal government has given it little attention; dietary guidelines apply only to children 2 and older.<br>  <br>  [...]<br>  <br>  The lack of variety in the American approach also could be a problem. Exposing infants to more foods may help them adapt to different foods later, which Ludwig says may be key to getting older children to eat healthier.<br>  <br>  Food allergy fears get some of the blame for the bland approach. For decades doctors have said the best way to prevent allergies is to limit infants to bland foods, avoiding seasonings, citrus, nuts and certain

hSJnaysiaa	He was out of line, not you. They are your children and it was your house, not his place to comment or judge.<br>  <br>  I think so many people are afraid to discipline their kids these days that kids are becoming totally out of line (and too sensitive when someone does try to show them right from wrong).<br>  <br>  Abuse is wrong of course, but a slap on the hand or bottom is a good way to show your child that you mean what you say.|`|45nSn7Rcaa	You did nothing wrong.  That is a perfectly good way to teach a child that they can't touch something.  Spanking is perfectly good too.  <br>  The world is filling up with more and more people who don't think you can discipline a child anymore, they don't think you can tell a child no, they don't think children should have to do anythinig for themselves and the parents take care of everyting, they basically give the children the role as the person to run the household.  It is ruinning society.|`|FhlmiI7daa	she cried because it hurt not because it made a noise.  How would you like it if someone smacked your hand hard enough to leave a redmark everytime you made a bad decision.  Guiding your child isnt about punishment it is an opportunity to teac them something.|`|yPNvecc7aa	Most kids start to cry if you just yell or just tell them "no", so of course they'll cry when you swat their hand. <br>  He should have minded his own business. It's not as if you smacked her clear accross the head or anything.<br>  <br>  I don't think you should feel guilty about it.|`|nfzQkvqraa	He was just asking you a simple question.  I don't see the big deal.  He saw you hit your child and responded that way probably because it caught him off guard.|`|T864ejaiaa	he had no right. some people don't spank their kids.|`|prqrQcd1aa	I'm not anti spanking, and i'm not pro spanking, but there are other ways to deal with this type of thing when a child, especially one that is only 15 months old is doing things! You are, alas, entitled to your own way of doing things, but i will tell you i've seen children this age have the same thing done to them, then the parent wonders why they go around hitting everyone...<br>  The man was proabally shocked at what you did, maybe he doesn't agree with it. I'd simply say what you would have said to me when you read what i just wrote!|`|sr7jX2wYaa	It is isn't  a matter if  he had the  right,  It was a natural question  for someone who finds physical discipline of  any kind unorthodox. they do say hitting  of  any kind  teaches  children to hit. I personally  think smacking a hand & causing  a minor  amount of pain  is better  than have  them grab a steaming  bowl of  something or a  Hot cup  of coffee off the table & scald themselves & possibly scar them for life. I know that is not  what she was grabbing  but  who is to say that  next time she tried it  that may be  what it was*|`|510MC9SVaa	Spanking is not the most effective way to teach a child not to do something. Sure, it can be effective, but it is not recommended unless the child is doing something that may harm themselves or another. <br>  <br>  Your house should be childproofed to the point that your daughter can play with the things on the table and it be ok. If it is not to that point, and you don't want to make it that way, then you should pay more attention to her and redirect her when she tries to get into something you don't want her getting into. Too many parents believe that hitting their child makes up for the parents not doing their job. Your job is to protect your child and teach your child how to behave. You are teaching your child that the attention she is guaranteed to get is by getting into trouble. She gets yelled at and hit if she gets into things and probably chose to do so to get some attention. You were paying attention to the coworker of your husband and not paying attention to her. <br>  <br>  Someone needs to spank your hand and yell at you.<br>  <br>  bad girl|`|AA12005445	If my kids deserved a smack they got one no matter what other people might think. Now they are both grown up they have both mentioned that it done them no harm and that it was their prefered method of punishment as it only hurt for a wee while.  Just long enough to remind them that they had done something naughty. Neither would of lliked me to shout at them which is what happens a lot nowadays and shouting at the kids is something I dont beleive in for a number of reasons. My kids realised that if they did something naughty then they had to suffer the consequences. <br>  My 2 grown up daughters are a credit to me and have never brought any trouble to my door and they are happy sensible women so it doesnt seem to of done them any harm.  Actually they both agree with me.|`|dAsrWr3Maa	There was nothing wrong with you disciplining your child, especially in your own home.  I am a firm believer in spankings.  As long as they are not over done and you are not abusing your child, it does not give anyone a right to second guess your action.  She is your child and not his!!!  I'm sure you would not visit his home and ask why he doesn't spank his children when they are misbehaving.  Kids now-a-days are getting out of hand due to the lack of discipline whether it be punishment i.e. time out etc. or a pop on the hand.|`|ovxQ8HLuaa	Some people just make me laugh because they are so ignornant.. im talking bout those who think smacking a childs hand is abuse!!!.. I am guessing you don't even have a child??? I mean, smacking a child's hand when they are constantly going for things that are "no no's" is the only way to teach them. My 1 yr old is constantly going for outlets. I have tried distracting her with something else .. I've tried everything actually.. nothing worked.. so I smacked her hand the last time she did it and she doesnt bother the outlets anymore. i'm sorry, but i'd rather my children not get electricuted because I was too "perfect" to not discipline my child. I was spanked as a child and I turned out just fine.... I dont spank my children but i do not see anything wrong with smacking their hands when they are doing something that can take their life.... <br>  <br>  Now to answer the question.. I think that the guy had no right in saying anything. You did not abuse your child. now if you had smacked her bottom or anywhere else but her hand then i could see where he would have spoken up and said something.|`|xApAWlshaa	You hit your child?<br>  Smacking is a form of violence regardless of where its done. im speaking my mind just as he has.Now you can get mad all you want of my response but dont take it out on your child by smacking her.and making her cry.also i dont think she cried from the sound.because well shes 15 months old.at that stage if fireworkds dont scare a child i dont see how a pop noise could.|`|60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	No offense but he probably only said it b/c he was concerned.  Some people know that swatting a toddler on the hand only encourages/ teaches them to swat and that swatting is okay.  I doubt he meant it to be insulting.|`|cAtWxJG1aa	If you're confident it's not abusive, then you can confidently answer that to someone who inquires.  But I don't think it's out of line to make an inquiry of someone who hits their toddler hard enough to provoke them to cry or to "leave a red mark for a while."<br>  <br>  <br>  *eta -- don't ask if you don't want an answer....|`|uCnmYEPBaa	I've popped my children on their hands for not listening after I've told them not to touch.<br>  Obviously that person does not have children of their own otherwise they would know why you did it.<br>  You were not beating your child, just giving mild discipline because she did not listen.<br>  You were fine.|`|IFDfpbFJaa	People think they know everything. Had you pulled her down and pulled her pants off and spanked her butt...that would be bad, but a slap on the hand is not bad at all....just brush it off and hope his child gives him a run for his money. He might even spank his child harder than you did but never admit to it....people are weird.|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	Of course he has a right to speak his mind.  <br>  <br>  To answer your question re: why someone would freak out over seeing you swat your daughter - I would say that for some people seeing someone hit a child is just as disturbing as seeing someone hit an adult.|`|SnQvsOPwaa	Whats the difference between hitting(popping) the hand and hitting(spanking) the bottom?
Ot8lxaMEaa	Yogurt is the gentlest dairy product and would be the best to start with. Yobaby makes a yogurt brand that is plain, banana, peach and pear which are easy for them to digest. You will just have to try it and see how it goes. Give her a small amount and wait a few days. If theres no reaction, try giving it to her in larger amounts. The next thing to try would be cheese. If she does fine with that, she more than likely will be ok with milk but not guarunteed. Her system may have matured enough to handle dairy. Its all about trial and error. There is always soy, rice or goats milk if regualr doesnt work. Good luck|`|iQcd37Goaa	well my cousin was like that and they switch him to whole milk when he was 1 year and he did great now hes 2 years and has no problems with dairy..good luck|`|w4zjmhxoaa	You don't have to give her milk (dairy).  You can go straight to soy milk.  My son is lactose intolerant, and I noticed these problems when I was nursing.  I couldn't eat anything containing any form of dairy!  He's now 20 months old and still can't have any dairy.  He's also allergic to soy, so I give him goats milk, or rice milk, and he does just fine!  <br>  Yogurt, I would wait until she's closer to a year, since she's had dairy problems in the past.  Just to give her digestive system a little longer to develop.  Dairy can be hard to digest! <br>  Good luck!|`|846b3af290613f2b0cdb0b7edc68ce91aa	I was a soy baby.  I'm allergic to any dairy products.  As a baby in the late 70's, it took a whole lot of testing to figure out that milk was making me sick.  But as I grew up I still couldn't stomach it.  She might be allergic like I am.  Unfortunately, the only way to be sure if she is, or if she's lactose intolerant, is to try her.  If she gets fussy or gassy or constipated ot diarrhea, then she is still not going to be able to eat/drink it.  I was 13 yrs old before I could even handle 2% milk, and I still can't drink much of it without problems.  Although dairy based foods are ok now for me.  I have a 12 yr old daughter with the same problem, though hers is not as severe as mine was.  My advice would be to talk to the dr. before introducing any dairies, and get his opinion. He may have a suggestion about which would be the gentlest products to try and what to watch for in the way of reactions.<br>  <br>  Good Luck. I hope she does better.
Z8Ui1ugLaa	Definitely ask the dentist at his next visit, they will probably refer you to an orthodontist.

cxcDP97qaa	Just because you have kids doesn't make you a nutrition specialist (talking to military mummy).  *rolls eyes*<br>  <br>  Fresh fruits and veggies are always better.  You have to think too, they have to HEAT these V8 juices to make sure it kills bacteria (which is bullshit...but whatever).  But where is the logic in, "it only kills bacteria"?  When you heat stuff up, you denature almost everything.  That's why people say "cold press" is better.  So just because the nutrition label says it contains stuff, it doesn't mean your body can actually utilize it.<br>  <br>  And honestly, I wouldn't contact your medical doctor.  Yes, you heard right.  If anything, find a nutrition specialist or a chiropractor.  MD's take 3 credit hours of nutrition, yet people still think they know everything?  It's ridiculous.  Yet, nutrition specialist...SPECIALIZE in it.  Chiropractor's also love to take seminars that all the nutrition specialists take so they are also very wise when it comes to health (most of the newer chiropractors though; most older ones are ignorant to that part of the health field).|`|mLbydsVIaa	of course. all v8 is is blended vegetables w/ added vitamins anyway. its easier when theres no vegetables to eat and it good when your on the go.<br>  i drink v8 fusion. its a mix of fruits and vegetables and in every 8 oz glass of it you get 1 serving of both!! plus its good...it tastes more like fruit than vegetables...you can hardly tell theres veggies in there<br>  but if your still conderned jsut ask your doctor<br>  good luck and hope this helps! :)|`|UEAzzroAaa	Supposedly, but fresh fruits and veggies are better.

My sons doctor says he fine...just a healthy big lil boy..lol...hes 2years and 2 months by the way.|`|365d70b021fb625020b0fa8e63533e37aa	the nurse told you<br>  listen to her|`|OF7ZHq19aa	If he is bigger than others hi age my son is 2 and he weighs 26 pounds|`|9ptIuJ8uaa	I have the same problem! Small world- I just posted a question for the same reason a couple days ago. My son is 3. The doctor's office gives you a percentile- which just means that is where your son is when you compare him to other kids his age. My son's weight is in the 80th percentile which means he is heavier than 80% of the kids his age. He is 39 lbs at 3years and 3months. I think he is healthy but he could stand to lose a couple pounds. If you are happy with how he is don't worry about what others think- just keep him healthy!|`|aSLw2vInaa	I have three  children who all weighed between 34 and 36 pounds at their two year check up. My children were also all atleast 36 inches tall. I dont think it's so much the weight but maybe the height to weight ratio. There are websites that let you calculate the percenteges and your childs BMI. This is one that helped me.|`|XGx9WORLaa	that nurse should be fired she has no right to say that your child is not overweight my son is almost 16 months and he weighs 25 lbs and is by no means fat If I were you i would be finding a different doctor to bring my child to that is absurd|`|KNX2sKr7aa	Kids grow at different rates.  I don't think 30 lbs for a 2 year old is a big problem.  I think that's actually the high end of normal.  Nurses like that are why kids end up with eating disorders.
88da4fce02503c5761f7a46fae092803aa	Why not. They are your children. Then when they are older, you can let them know that there is a story behind their names. Also it lets them see you as a person, on what you liked at that time when you were pregnant with them.|`|tboBarP7aa	Some of the names are pretty.. But that's a little much to name them because of the series. Not to mention how many people do you think have already done this and will continue to until the twilight fad is over.|`|HhmBbaRPaa	Embry, Jasper, and Alice i think are the best..but id keep in mind youre probably not the only person whos going to be naming your kids after these characters :D Theyre all great names though with or without them being from a book.|`|i3FgiLENaa	Don't even!!!!! <br>  Especially not renesmee. I hated when bells did that. I read the books, and yes they're very good but don't do that, its so ridiculous!!<br>  Ughh|`|5OJ5WUUdaa	Emmett|`|Yx1xNa9Maa	try that which increases child's X factor|`|bfuMcrR4aa	i like renesmee!! she was so cute in the book. and rayne is a beautiful name. I also like bella.|`|dIZ9Enimaa	Please don't name your child Renesemee!|`|5QtseYWuaa	I like Rayne|`|E4tsKFMMaa	Can't you be original?  Try to pick something that isn't going to make your child one of 6 'Bellas' in grade school!!!|`|ku5NPnkfaa	That is so dumb to name your baby after a movie/book that is just a fad about vampires.|`|TCpPdqcBaa	Why don't you try naming your children after something that acutally matters rather than a stupid fad book series that will be forgotten in 5 years...|`|215dfe0c283eb141a2ed0b4dcb32274caa	I have the name Emmett on my list for our third child. I do like the book series but that i snot the reason I like it. It's a nice, normal, masculine name that can grow with the child! I also think Embry is a cool name even though I would never use it!|`|igvUbqkyaa	I like Alice and Emmett most. Rosalie is okay but I much prefer just Rose and the nickname Rosie or something. I don't love any of them, but those are my favorites.|`|ppE0GtkIaa	I absolutely love the name Jasper (Jasper Jax) if I was to have a boy :o)|`|IvkNTqDMaa	Jasper is my two year old DOGS name!|`|HtiI05Tmaa	you would say that.. but just remember your child is going to have to stay with that name for the rest of its life and your going to name ti after twilight .. when your child askes where their name comes from you have to say twilight .. its a movie and there going to say wtf?? are you on crack ?? lol ahhaahahaha ily =]<br>  j/k <br>  Rosalie is a pretty name =]]|`|iyEYXiq8aa	Don't you think it's a bit obsessive? <br>  <br>  I've always loved the name Jasper and maybe you could do Rosa/Rose instead of Rosalie. Alice is also ok but  don't like any of the others.|`|61NKzPzMaa	I like Jasper, Alice, Emmett, Rosalie and Embry.<br>  <br>  You spelled Renesme wrong lol.<br>  <br>  I don't like Irina or Quil.|`|edLbogmYaa	You are not mature enough to have children! Naming your child after the characters in twilight is a bit obessive and nutty! And also Jasper is my cats name...|`|fMKPp6qkaa	i like...<br>  Jasper<br>  Emmett<br>  Rosalie<br>  and Reneseme|`|VEkkn2Otaa	Call Embry, Embryo<br>  Those are horrid names!|`|nOzQUsToaa	I'd name my Twilight babies Esme Bella and Jasper Emmet.

WIeCX71Daa	I couldn't care less what a parent did to earn money to look after their kids as long as the kids are well looked after. If the children are repeatedly dirty, messy, hungry and have holey clothes and the parents are scraping together money for smokes then I will judge.<br>  <br>  In my opinion, people who work in the Adult industry in what ever capacity are no different from people who work in banks or who are overweight or that could be the next governor.  It all comes down to the kids. How they look and behave, if they are fed, clean and tidy (which of course I'm not talking name brand clothing that is brand new). But you can tell a child who's parents take pride in their offspring even if they are short on money, their kids still look neat and tidy.|`|T52u1DVXaa	No, I'm not that type of person.  I know people don't follow the stereotype for their jobs.  My husband does not fit the stereotypical lawyer mold at all.  And I'm sure when someone sees you work in adult material they'll assume you're a porn star, you have orgies in front of your children and leave your sex toys where they can find them.  I just don't feel you can judge someone based on their career, especially comparing career to childrearing.|`|4lHJEq5Haa	good question! But honestly, I've never thought about it before! Although I do admit that sometimes I make judgement calls on moms who are getting Medicaid, WIC and other freebies while trying to concieve baby #3... <br>  As long as your profession is stable and your kids are happy and healthy, I have no reason to judge anyone. And to be honest, I'm way too wrapped up in my own family to worry about anyone else's job.|`|0QYIbn1saa	Nope, I think that's fantastic!  I don't judge people, unless they are being outright rude and closed-minded pricks.  Then I'll get my guns out, lol.  I admire people that are different and don't see everything in black and white.  :)<br>  <br>  And if I need to borrow any adult material, can I e-mail you? :P|`|IawZ34MXaa	I only judge parents that work in the welfare and foodstamp lines.|`|LwbwMFX9aa	as long as youre not on the goverments tit draining our country dry and NOT doing anything illegal I dont care|`|ba91f39977984e4e7308c5858b127eeeaa	no, but you must live in the sfv area right?|`|1tmX7xbRaa	well, the first decision i make when it comes to thinking if someone is a good parent or not is if the children are happy, healthy, clean etc. other then that i don't think much else matters. i think that a parents work CAN effect a child but only if the parent allows it to. like you said, you keep your work separate from your family life, which to me would mean that what you do at work stays at work when you leave and when you are home you are with your family. that's quality family time. so no i don't think you are a horrible parent.<br>  now somebody who deals drugs and takes their kid on the car ride to deliver it...bad parent.|`|G7tFsXWZaa	sounds like you're a pretty good parent. it really doesn't matter what job you have... if you're taking good care of your kids than it doesn't matter where the money comes from. just be careful that when your children get older they don't get ridiculed becasue of the job you have. i don't personally judge but i know middle and high school kids do.|`|Ybo6HS8Caa	I do not make judgements based on occupation.  I know a couple of strippers, who are very intelligent women, and were stripping because the money is good, and that's how they were putting themselves through college.  I feel like if you are doing what you have to do to support your family, then more power to you.  It is only when I see what I think is "bad parenting" that I might judge, but not occupation.|`|hKJIDdVqaa	my opinion of your job occupation has nothing to do with my opinion on your parenting skills.  I will have an opinion if your child comes to me and says you are not feeding, loving or properly providing for them or abusing them.  Until then my opinion means nothing.  Regardless of the job, it should be a separate entity from the home life.  My husband owns his own construction company and we still keep that separate from family life.|`|mx3gFmIKaa	Ashamed to say that I am guilty, I tend to assume that blue collar worker parents are more likely to spank and holler.  Terrible I know, and I know its not true.<br>  <br>  Judging is horrible and I really really try to keep an open mind.<br>  <br>  I am not at all a prudish person and have no pre-conceived ideas about women working in an adult industry.<br>  <br>  No I would think you are a saavy parent.<br>  <br>  Honestly I am one of the least judgemental persons anyone could meet, but I am a work in progress because I catch myself sometimes and I really don't approve of judging others.|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	my opinion - if you love your kids and you do whats best for your kids, you are most likely a good parent (you as an euphemism)<br>  i don't judge other parents.  i don't have enough energy to care about what someone else does for a living or even what kind of parent they are.  i personally try and see the best in everyone and believe the best in the majority.|`|flqAr30laa	if the kids are fine then no.<br>  <br>  My motto is " You set the example all of the time" so I wouldn't be dabbling in any job that dealt with hard core adult material. But that's just me personally.<br>  Every decision I make , I make with my child in mind.|`|dd8cb229ee241de8ca385f84ec4b33d7aa	In my town, there are a lot of judgments made on what school in the town you go to<br>  <br>  It does not matter if your a doctor or Lawyer or work at subway<br>  If you live in the north end of town, the south and east part looks down on you.  You could be a doctor living in the north end, and someone works at subway, and lives in the east part of town, would be consider a better parents and can support their child better<br>  <br>  I like the school my daughter goes to, she has children of all races and economical situation.  Most of the time, our children are better behave<br>  <br>  No, I would not look down on you
7PdqcUsiaa	Try to use this ovulation calendar tool.<br>   <a href="http://www.softorbits.com/awc/" rel="nofollow">http://www.softorbits.com/awc/</a><br>   to trace your cycle and find the date of ovulation|`|7pU5yTtzaa	Hi I am the same I fluctuate from 27 days to 34 and I have been trying for 9 months. I have now started to try the ovulation tests and I am now on cycle day 21 with no positive its so frustrating... I do however have an aching pain in my right ovary for most of today so maybe this could be my body preparing. You are supposed to take average of the last 6 months but to be honest I would advise you take each cycle as it comes and use ovulation tests to be sure. Good Luck to you :o)
xp4mhkqgaa	I work 17 1/2 hours a week (2 days one week, 3 days the next), and when my son was in nursery he went to afterschool on the days I was working.  It was mainly for school children, but they did take in some kids from nursery, too.  <br>  <br>  They picked the kids up from nursery, took them to their afterschool premises, then gave them lunch and kept them up until the parents finished work (or 5.45pm at the latest).  <br>  <br>  It was a council run place, and it was great.  It only cost me a few pounds per week.  They had a few different rooms - art room, gym etc, so the kids had a great time playing there, too.  <br>  <br>  You should check and see if there's any in your area.  I haven't used it for a while now, as my son is 11 and just comes home from school, so I don't know if there's still a lot of them running.  The way they're shutting down schools these days, I wouldn't be surprised if they were closing down a lot of the afterschools as well.  But, good luck finding somewhere.|`|bspRfskYaa	Not my personal experience but a friend of mine has a childminder who picks up a number of children from the nursery and takes them home with her.  She gives them lunch and doesn't charge a lot.<br>  Alternatively could you arrange with another parent to take it in turns to pick up the children and bring them home for the afternoon?  You might be helping out someone else with the same problem and it's only going to be for a few months as the little one will be able to go all day the following september.|`|U5iot8qfaa	this probably wont help but work and babies do not go well together. my wife stopped work when she gave birth, child care is too hard to organise and most of the time is not cost affective, parents are always the best to take care of the child.
suP3ajmxaa	The same thing happened with me with both of my kids I'd have to pee so bad but nothing would come out I went to the emergency room and they said it's completely normal and not to worry about it Then at my next appointment with my doctor I asked him and he told me the same thing|`|gJ2vPKqsaa	Having to pee constantly is one of the symptoms I seem to get when I'm pregnant, so it's probably just that.  Get used to it because it doesn't go away until you give birth! :P|`|yPNvecc7aa	You might have a urinary tract infection. It always feels like you have to pee but you don't. You'll have to check with your doctor.<br>  Either that or it's just pregnancy. It's normal.|`|Hu9yquP4aa	sounds like a UTI|`|mc6YtaRbaa	You could have a UTI or a tilted uterus. A tilted uterus usually fixes itself during the 1st trimester but you can see your Dr. and they can try to move it for you. A UTI if left untreated can lead to a kidney infection and many other problems and should not be ignored.

48b2b41f5c4a3bc51bd8f89661550c98aa	We used Avent bottles and my son took to them very well.  Whatever bottles you use, just make sure you get the slow flow nipples.  Babies will start to prefer a bottle if the flow is faster than the breast flow.  We never brought bottles when we were out in public.  If I felt uncomfortable, I would go into the bathroom to nurse.  I found bringing bottles along is very inconvenient.  The mall had a family bathroom/nursing room, so I didn't have an issue there.  For the most part we tried to work our schedule around his eating schedule.|`|IyWnHqPuaa	When I was Breastfeeding and pumping for when I was at work I bought my baby bottles called BREASTFLOW they are designed so that baby will have an easy time switching back and forth. I bought them at babys r us.
AA11865684	Caitlyn is my fav.|`|RZQHB0g8aa	I think Caitlin is good as it's the original way of spelling that name. Personally, I prefer it spelled with a K so the nickname can be Katie.

nmu6coapaa	My 15 month old cousin does this too! They think it's hilarious! She's probably just messing about|`|ENANtueuaa	She's playing with it...my daughter did this too. Just tell her "no, that's not what we do, we drink it," or something along those lines...if she continues you can take her cup away for a few minutes, and tell her she needs to drink right. She's fine!|`|AA11109728	If she's smiling, it's most definitely on purpose!

I tell her no and that makes her do it more.  I would think if she really had a problem swallowing, you would know it by now.|`|WOHc22Xiaa	My son did that now he just takes a sip and spits it back in the cup.

My daughter and the girl I watch both do this off and on, I think it's just the sensation of it on their chins lol!

Also, if you do end up with food poisoning, it doesn't affect the baby only that the precaution of dehydration is really something that you should be careful with. Was the sausage cooked properly? If anything, I am more concerned about listeria. Please cook, hot dogs, deli meat, cold cuts and sausages thoroughly so as to avoid listeria and any bacterial growth.|`|9tMFZ0Jsaa	Its highly likely, that being over a week out of date that you have ingested some form of E.Coli bacteria. If you're lucky you will not develop septicaemia, but if you do, you could lose your baby.|`|SRzswqTeaa	If you feel fine, that is the only concern.

axOJ2XUIaa	This is the father asking this question?  You should NEVER hit a kid.  At this age, you could have her taken away from you and that seen as child abuse.  Let me ask you a question?  Would you mind or believe a bigger person who hit you?  Have you been hitting her all of her life?  Because that is probably why she doesn't mind you, or care what you think.  I never hit my girls, ever, and they grew up to be terrific adults.  Try sitting down with her and taking the time to talk.  Ask her what is bothering her, why is she doing these things that can obviously hurt her.  Let her know that you are worried about her.  (This is a good thing.  All kids want to be loved and worried about).  Tell her how you feel, but let her do most of the talking.  Do this every day or every other day and the bad behavior just might dissipate.  Good luck.  Remember, no violence.  You will just make it worse.|`|BzYbEa6Taa	I'm calling you out you troll. This exact same question was asked yesterday and i mean exact word for word. Her eis the proof"How would I spank my daughter? Spank her hard?<br>  How would I spank my daughter?<br>  Hello, I am the mother of a 15 yr girl. Latey ive noticed that shes been very impatient with me. never telling me were she is going, or letting me know when she is coming back home. She also has been called me a *****, which I find very offensive form my own daughter. I think she deserves a spanking. How would I go about doing this? Please respond. Thank you."  <br>  <br>  <br>  Here is my Answer: "If my daughter ever called me a ***** i'd swat her just hard enough on the mouth that she would know better than to ever do that again. <br>  <br>  As for spanking her she is too old for that and i doubt it will have the reaction that your looking for, now I recommend taking her cell phone away, radio/Cd player and any other technological devise that she might be highly attached too. then let her know that she is to come home after school and is grounded from all to her activities till further notice..<br>  <br>  after a while she might start to show some respect and trust me if she wants it from you she needs to give it to you."|`|FhlmiI7daa	you can't spank a 15 year old.  I think that you are lucky that she didn't turn out worse if you are parenting with this much ignorance.   You should try talking to her about the way you feel and ask her what is bothering her enough to act out.  You could also try grounding her or taking someting away (i.e. cell phone, computer).|`|acf19784c47b1f7b60623f6016329936aa	you are sick under no circumstanses do you spank a fifteen year old girl espessially if your male.........................ugh pervert!!<br>  if i knew you were serous and had your adress i would have the social services in a flash<br>  i dont believe in physical dissapline but it ussually stops at around 6|`|JILkhKjJaa	You should not be spanking a 15 year old girl!!!!! Punishment works better. For a teen girl I would suggest no phone, no computer, no video games. That will work better. Or if you can think of something else that she thinks she can't live without. Maybe a boyfriend?|`|bMvAmMTaaa	how about don't spank her at all! talk to her and explain what she is doing is unacceptable, if that doesn't work, enforce some strict discipline and stick to it e.g. grounding her.<br>  <br>  VIOLENCE IS NOT THE ANSWER TO ANYTHING, IT ONLY MAKES THINGS WORSE!|`|UoIdE0rSaa	She'd hit you back.<br>  Don't hit her, she'll never forgive you. And then she'll realise that if you want to play violently, that's what she's going to do.|`|H0fXySX9aa	if you hit her she would hit you back|`|xApAWlshaa	It's simple really.I would tell you not to spank but since you believe spankings will work i will tell you how.i think what your asking is how do i make spanking effective and or how do i show at the same time i spank out of love not anger.Well learn when to spank and how hard so you dont become abusive.also learn self restraint dont make spanking your #1 go to move or you may get into a habbit and may end up doing it in public which can cause alot of problems.But really just assure her before during and after that you are spanking her out of love not out of hate or anger.trust me swearing.impatience and disrespect all together deserves a spanking.|`|IzIVxV2Yaa	Spanking someone who is 15 is still assault even if you're her father. Try threatening to take away her privilages such as tv in her room, barring her from calling her friends, or something else along those lines. Let her know her behaviour is unacceptable, perhaps try to find out why she is behaving the way she is and look at why she called you what she did. Have you had a good relationship with her previously? Try talking to her in a calm reasonable manner, avoid shouting if possible. either way, resorting to physical violence isn't the answer. Good luck.|`|jKHLP2RWaa	spanking your daughter at this age is inapropriate and will not and cannot make her respect you <br>  try leveling with her, treating her as an equal when possible and maybe giving her more freedoms will keep her from feeling like she has to sneak around <br>  work on reigning her in rather than physically punishing her|`|SNVauR3laa	Why do you want to spank her? To prove that you are more powerful than her. She is 15, and she is doing what is normal. She is becoming an independant thinker. Now she needs to learn that although she is her own person, she is still your responsability, and she still has to respect rules, and adults. Spanking her is not going to teach her that. You have to demand respect, and punish her when she breaks the rules. You have to be consistent, and punish her every time, so she sees she is not going to get away with it. If she can't tell you where she is going, then she can't go. If she goes anyway, call the police, and let them know she is unruly. If you can't drag her home, they will. Know her friends, and their parents. When she says she is goign to Stacey's house, call Stacey's mom, and make sure that your daughter is really going there, and an adult will be there. She'll get the clue.<br>  <br>  For talking back, I would take away phone priveleges. If she can't speak with respect to you, then she won't speak to her friends for x amount of time. I would say you will have to do this four or five times in order to see a result.|`|hKJIDdVqaa	at 15 you now want to start spanking her.  My kids when they were babies would get a "pat" on their diapered behinds if they did something naughty.  That in-forced the fact my voice meant business.   Your daughter should know to listen to you by now. You cannot spank a 15 yr old it is ridiculous.  I mean I guess you can, but what purpose does that solve?  Find another method.  Further more a 15 year old has NO Business being in a situation of leaving the house unattended.  She needs to be home doing homework.|`|AA10720479	To late for spanking, that should have been done when she was younger. She is a normal teenager, they all do that to some extent or another. Just sit down and talk to her, and say name calling is unacceptable, and you need to know where she is in case of an emergency. If she doesn't want to tell you were she's at 9 times out of 10, she is doing something less desirable of a young lady.|`|T864ejaiaa	isn't she to old to spank? just ground her butt. if she refuses to listen call the cops on her. i had to do that once with my 15 year old girl. she walks the line. the police told her if she couldn't listen then they would take her somewhere where she will listen. good luck|`|cf5961a316debfb7203fffd630bd740caa	um, spanking a teenager is dumb and abusive. spanking a child of any age is abusive and stupid. why not ground her?|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	reporting you

AA11760500	My son had tubes put in when he was a year old.  We too suffered constant ear infections, respiratory infections etc. until the tubes.  They fell out about a year later and he (knock on wood) has been so much healthier.  He even has been wearned off ALL of his asthma meds.  Turns out the ear infections were the cause of it all.|`|cxcDP97qaa	Getting tubes in the kids ears was probably the worst thing in the world to do, yet the MD's still do it.  I don't understand it.  Your kid is going to have problems now, for the rest of his life...which sucks.  MOST ear infections are caused by milk.  Stop giving you kid that BS cow's milk (plus, it's not good for him anyways).  Getting the kid off of gluten and if you want to be extreme, take him off of wheat products.  90% of the population is allergic to wheat in one way or another.<br>  <br>  Take your kid to a chiropractor and explain everything about your kid to him/her.  They are usually good and helping with things like this...it would have been a lot better to go to a chiropractor first so your kid wouldn't have gotten tubes in his ears :(|`|aZXnW6AUaa	not too long see a child specialist.
9580a1e44dd3d2bae7d2f867611ab353aa	? Baby sitting, dog walking, lawn mowing.|`|rOfFOcwpaa	Breathing, it pays 0 cents per hour though.|`|AAbP4H9Kaa	Hey there, I myself was once 14-15 and looking for a job. and I had a job when I was 14. and then I also had one when I was 15. <br>  <br>  My first job was at a telephone survey company. Where you basically sit there and the computer dials numbers for you and you read off the screen. you need basic computer knowledge and communication skills. It pays pretty good. Usually a dollar or 2 above minimum wage. <br>  <br>  My second job was in chinatown. I am chinese and I looked older that my real age. Another reason why I why hired was because of family connections. Which leads me to my next point. <br>  <br>  For a first job, ask your parents if you can help them at work, it works well mostly when they are self employed. Or maybe you can volunteer where they work to gain experience, example, at a hospital is a good place to volunteer if you want to go into health. Maybe in a couple of years you could work where you volunteer. Or you can ask your parents if they know anyone who needs help. <br>  <br>  There are many places that could use your help, just remember, don't try too hard ( i.e. applying to shoe stores), but then again anything could happen.|`|AA12094570	Grocery stores, fast food places, babysitting, odd jobs.<br>  That's about it.
NZid2d1Paa	yeah it sounds like you are pregnant, the first signs are usually breast tenderness, and acid reflex, and being tired all the time. And if there was a faint line on your pregnancy test then yes you are pregnant, it doesnt matter if its light, if its there then you are, and the brown spotting is probably just implantation bleeding. happens around the time you get your period. Congrats and good luck.|`|g9TxgMlwaa	Could possibly be. I suggest you see a doctor. They'll be able to confirm it for sure.|`|GBBRH9y0aa	It is possible, really hard to tell, you may be about to start your period, boobs get tender then, but it does sound like you could possibly be pregnant|`|IYULF7NDaa	yes you are def pregnant! Same thing happened to me. I had 4 test show up that way. I'm now 2months:) Congrats!!
vue9NOhYaa	Tap water is perfectly safe. There's NO reason to be spending lots of money to buy bottled water. (Most of which is just tap water put into a bottle anyway.)<br>  <br>  The chlorine in tap water is there to kill bacteria, and is harmless.|`|jNgh3e3Faa	Boil it. I hate tap water. (MINE SMELLS)<br>  Wait for it to cool and drink it.<br>  Yummy.<br>  Or get your parents to get a faucet mount filter.....cheaper that way.<br>  Good for you drinking lots of water.<br>  Natural juices are good. (Juicy Juice...etc..)|`|qJBMdL7gaa	With both of my children I drank nothing but good old tap water...and they are happy healthy 5 and 2 year olds :)|`|AA10495188	If you boil your tap water then it is just like the distilled water that you would buy. (it helps get rid of all of the yuck from tap water).
IfKTQME0aa	Some suggestions:<br>  Check with your doctor about the tylenol dose for your baby's weight.  Our daughter was large and we were giving her too little.  But make sure Dr oks it.<br>  <br>  Cold washclothes help when you can supervise<br>  <br>  Give a passie or teething ring in the crib (especially if he can find it and reinsert it)...they can at least chew on it.<br>  <br>  Ibuprofen worked better than tylenol for my daughter and I would give it about the 1 hour before going to bed.<br>  <br>  But the truth is, if they are in pain the waking is probably going to happen and it truly is miserable on your sleep schedule.  Finally, if the tooth has broken through usually the pain is gone so it may be best to double check with the Dr to make sure there is nothing wrong....like no sores in mouth etc... Good luck...this will soon pass!|`|jivtit0Eaa	I dunno how much this helps but when my son was teething his doctor told me to let him sleep inclined like in his bouncy seat strapped in and if it vibrates that's better . Also Vanilla extract if you rub on his gums relieves the itchy pain in his mouth because there is no baby that likes orajel .<br>  Ps. humidifiers always soothe them to sleep too. It really works wonders my son has slept with a Humidifier since he was 3 months and he is almost a year now.|`|LvbizUcwaa	It is possible for him to be teething. but if baby orejel or teething tabs don't work id make a appointment with ur doctor. if he was a big boy at birth then yes its possible that he is teething, my friend has a 9 pound baby and at 3 months he was starting to teeth.|`|DDFSITiYaa	Teeth should not cause this much problems.  Most babies only feel a little discomfort from time to time from the pressure.  There are some that suffer more but it isn't the all out consuming pain that a lot of people seem to think.   In addition, if none of the remedies work, that would also mean it is not teeth.  Finally, with them already through the gum, that means the worst of those is over.  It is cutting the gum that is the most uncomfortable.  <br>  <br>  Is he cranky during the day?  Does he fuss all the time?  Is it restricted to night time?  Does he settle quickly when you just hold him?  He may not want to nurse because he isn't hungry.  <br>  <br>  Have a ped check him out but you also may need to work on sleep training.|`|Qe9rXFm0aa	Yah I am going to have to agree with everyone else..<br>  My daughter is a constant waker..and even at 7 months she only woke maybe 4 times during the night while teething..15 times is pretty extreme.<br>  <br>  I would think even a call to the DR would help..he could probably give some medical advice, that we may not know about..or this may be a red flag for a reason he may need to be seen.<br>  <br>  Good Luck, and I hope it gets better for you guys!!|`|t9S0dqfLaa	This is just a guess but maybe it's not his teeth at all.  A trip to the doc wouldn't hurt.
AA11538461	Yes, I had gained 6 pounds by 6 weeks and I felt stretched tight.|`|UEAzzroAaa	Ut oh, take it from me. Watch what you eat and cut back on the sugar. You may not be eating more, but everything you are eating is being absorbed to the baby. Sugar makes the baby grow really really fast (my doctor said so). <br>  <br>  EDIT: yes the first answer is right, your hips and pelvis are expanding too. So that could be the case.|`|JgSX5jsUaa	Yes, I had a similar experience. I am 11 weeks and at 4 weeks my clothes were already tight. I was looking a little pregnant at 6 weeks and now at 11 weeks people can definitely tell. Bloating this early is really common but if you don't feel like you're bloated don't worry. Every pregnancy is different and some women show really early...and apparently both of us are that kind of woman.<br>  <br>  You also show earlier if it is your second child.|`|x68MbXVLaa	I am 6 weeks pregnant too. Some of my trousers are tight too, try not to worry! As long as you are eating healthy food and taking pre-natal vitamins - you (and the little one) will be fine. My problem is my BBs - they have already grown by two cups sizes and are feeling very tender.<br>  <br>  As you said you aren't eating anymore than usual - I'm sure that the 4lbs must be some bloating .....and all that extra blood that our bodies are busy making.<br>  <br>  Good luck for the next eight and a half months :o)|`|hlycbIjPaa	I felt my pants get a bit tighter, but they didn't get painfully tight until last month, when i was around 12 wks.<br>  It could also be your mind playing tricks on you.<br>  But don't worry your belly will be big enough soon!|`|SiIuJXvwaa	the reason why your trousers feel tight on you is because your pelvis is making room for your baby so it might be better if you get trousers that have a draw string for comfort
iIVnndPzaa	lol|`|113FoyMFaa	Getting a tattoo of grammar tips?<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  please?
AA11208683	here is a couple of ways to get labor started by yourself... it would probably be better for the doctors to say when baby comes because they know better, but 37 weeks is far enough along where the baby will be fine born now... <br>  -nipple stimulation - this has to be done several times a day for hours at a time, and switch from nipple to nipple every 10 -15 mins or so. but just to warn you this one might make the contractions stronger and longer.<br>  - castor oil - it has been done but is not the best way to get labor started because it causes major problems... major cramping and vomiting and diarriha.<br>  - walking - if you are dialating and ripe, this will start labor faster. but don't over do it.<br>  - sex - semen contains something (can't member the name) that will soften the cervix which will help with starting labor and dialating.<br>  - bumpy roads - not sure if this really works but i was told if your body is ready to have the baby this will help it along faster just like the walking.<br>  - some herbs and teas <br>  - spicy foods<br>  hope this helps... good luck!|`|JMI40MHpaa	try castor oil .. there's a bit of controversy surrounding it but i used it for my son twice .. the first time it didn't work but the second time i went into labor about 4 hrs after .. i like it because it only works if the baby's ready .. and my son was born healthy <br>  w/e you decide good luck and congrats|`|g9vw4ovGaa	I delivered my daughter three days before her due date and she is perfectly healthy.  Babies will come when they are ready. Their lungs emit a hormone that puts you into labor, when their lungs are ready, they will come. The way I was always told is drink lots of fluids and walk around quite a bit. I walked miles and miles, which in turn kept me from swelling and made my delivery pretty smooth, 6 hours long! Also, sex can put you into labor, its an old wives tale, but it turned out to be true for  me. My poor husband just had his wisdom teeth taken out, and he was a few weeks til deployment to Iraq. We knew we would have to wait 6 weeks before sex and by that time he would be gone. So we decided to have sex the night before she was born even though the doctor said it wouldn't be a good idea for him. That morning at 9 am I went into labor, by 4pm she was in the world. Just give your body time, that baby will come when he or she is ready!
uFrqC4Y2aa	YES! It's very annoying. ANd I'm constantly clearing my throat and blowing my nose. I was told by other women tha had it that it clears up the day after you deliver. Weird.|`|wTYh7DiSaa	Yes, I had an attack of sinusitis just 2 weeks ago. I was given Claritin and saline nose spray plus lozenges. I would highly recommend talking to your OB about your symptoms and maybe they will also prescribe you something for it (i.e. if you have allergies etc).|`|zHy0z7sAaa	Thats totally normal.My nose was either runny or congested the entire time I was pregnant.My ears were also stuffy.It's due to the increased blood flow in your body and to your respiratory tract lining.All of its caused by those dreaded hormones.And everyone thinks pregnancy is so easy :0)
AkFag8tNaa	While it sounds odd, butter is part of what gives cakes and breads their fluffiness and it imparts a much better flavor.|`|AA10624857	Do you have any applesauce at home?  Applesauce can be substituted for the oil in muffins with very nice results plus it makes the muffins more healthy.  You can also use mashed up bananas or other mashed fruit.  Use equal amounts of applesauce as what the recipe calls for oil.  Don't use butter, melted or otherwise as it will change the consistency of the batter and they will not bake properly.  Olive oil would be your closest substitute for vegetable oil, but the flavor will be different and possibly not a good flavor depending on the type of muffins you are making.  ADDED:  Actually, I just double checked and you should use 1/2 as much applesauce as oil.  So, if the recipe calls for 1 cup of oil, use 1/2 cup of applesauce (or other fruit puree).  Check out the link below for some correct substitutes.  My aunt is a culinary arts instructor at the college level and I've learned a lot about how ingredients work together in recipes from her.  Solid fats like butter are going to change the end product in a recipe that calls for oil.  Butter and oil are not interchangeable when it comes to baking without causing changes in the end result.  Here is another website with baking substitutions  <a href="http://www.foodsubs.com/Fatsoils.html." rel="nofollow">http://www.foodsubs.com/Fatsoils.html.</a>  If you have solid shortening at home such as Crisco, you can melt that and use in the muffins.  I encourage you not to use the butter since it will make baked goods spread more as well as brown more.|`|nuBRcuwvaa	I think that olive oil is more of a "cooking" product, not baking.  It has a certain taste that goes great for grilling or frying, but not sweets.<br>  <br>  I would definitely use butter.|`|7lmtBhdMaa	Olive oil has a 'flavor' and is not good for making muffins . Use butter.or shortning. Your body isn't going to be ruined by a muffin made with butter. Use it..|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	Personally, I'd go with melted butter.  I believe olive oil has a distinct flavor that would not go well with sweet muffins.|`|Z8Ui1ugLaa	butter, it will taste better.

F12ekJ7Saa	I know how it feels to try and try again and still no baby. I tried with for 8 months and now we are going to start trying again sometime this June. First of all you should stop drinking caffeine (soda, coffee, etc). You can also try doing some exercise like squats... something that will strengthen your leg muscles and the muscles around that area. Make sure you are taking vitamins. Eat fruits, vegetables, and dairy. For your husband, make sure he doesn't ejaculate without 48-72 hours. By doing this you can raise his sperm count and then when you have intercourse you have a more likely chance of becoming pregnant.Another thing you can do is to relax these couple of weeks. Stress is a big factor and if you are stressed it can cause your period to be late. If your period is late you will think you are pregnant which in reality you are not. Sad I know but just think positive and sure enough it will happen. I wish you the best of luck!*Baby Dust*|`|o9Xh4ix1aa	Definately not too soon to start planning.  My Dr. has had me on prenatal vitamins before we start "trying".  They do say being in the "normal" weight category ups your chances... but I think that being underweight hurts your chances more (sometimes you'll stop ovulating then).  <br>  <br>  I've read the following help sperm count.  Eating tomato products, zinc, b vitamins- and a well balanced diet of dad.  Making sure he doesn't constrict his area, keeping cell phones out of his pocket/belt, and no wasting his boys while you are trying (no alone happy time).  <br>  <br>  I've read this helps women: taking geritol and taking cough syrup while you're trying (it thins mucus and makes it easier for the boys to swim).  <br>  <br>  Good Luck!!!!|`|FzHaIu8laa	No hot tub for him, no caffeine for you both, you both eat healthy, start taking prenatal vitamins for you and folic acid, both of you drink plenty of water, water is good for your cervical mucus, no stress and let it happen naturally, keep track of your periods. It is never to soon to start planning, the sooner the better depending on age. Best wishes.
hVVALFAPaa	That is normal. Sometimes his urine is diluted, sometimes not. He may also have more urine at some times than others which would give a stronger smell.<br>  <br>  Some diapers absorb the liquid with a gel-like substance. It is a powder, but turns to gel when the liquid hits it. These diapers do not have as much of a smell because the urine turns to a different form. Other diapers simply soak it up with cotton-like material, which will preserve the urine smell.|`|q4rG5Dwtaa	Yes i have noticed this in my baby too. I think its normal.
XYBHM8aSaa	Yes, you could be pregnant.  <br>  <br>  Go to the drugstore and buy a test.  Then you will know for sure.
CUanPEmeaa	I would definately test. I was told if your temp doesn't go down than there is a chance of pregnancy or a chance you didn't O at all. You need to test though and maybe even a blood test to confirm either and than you may need some provera to get your cycle started. Really hope you get that BFP.|`|dtZ3tmoRaa	I wish that I could help you out with this hun, but I have no idea. Sorry, and I hope you find the answer you need and LOTS AND LOTS of baby dust to you!!|`|9Y0LAUn1aa	sorry i dont know, but im showing you that i read it! =]|`|savIDjYyaa	I'm sorry hun.. but I do not understand how you or anyone ready that bbt chart.. you should try fertilityfriend.com.  It is way better or at least it was for me.. I got prego when using it.  I would just take a test to be on the safe side b/c by the looks of your symptons you may have some symptoms of pregnancy. Good Luck sweetie..
dlOFWcU4aa	Hey Ashley!!!<br>  <br>  I think that you are pregnant!!!  I am SOOOO hoping so anyway!  I am praying for you and gathering baby dust for us both!!!|`|wom2ER4Baa	hope you r pregnant..take a test and keep us updated
4V4m2uZ5aa	Your symptoms sound alot like mine. It's weird you mentioned "itchy" boobs because mine have been too. Also the pinching in your stomach that's something I have felt.<br>  To me it sounds like early symptoms. I wouldn't let the bfn get you down it's probably to early. <br>  I think the answer about the cervix is right. I wouldn't worry to much about that.<br>  I would get another test and take it tomorrow. Definitely with first morning urine.<br>  Good Luck!!!!!<br>  Lots of Baby Dust!!!!!!|`|L9Yzg5IWaa	You won't know until you take a test.

Im not to sure on checking the cervix as not that far into research on TTC, but from what another answer said it might not necessarily be a negative sign. <br>  If you cant wait until AF is due then maybe call your doc and ask for a blood test to ease your mind.<br>  Fingers crossed its your BFP :)<br>  Baby dust to you x0x|`|9a3sNrEqaa	hey hun!!!!!!!! Okay here is the thing, some people have great luck figuring out if pregnancy has occured by checking their cervix but its not a definite indicator of pregnancy. My dr says that your cervix can change postions throughout the day ect ect. Everyone who gets pregnants cervix is not high and soft right away. Thats why they say its not a good idea to be checking cervical postioning for possible pregnancy. So don't let that rain on your parade!!!!! I mean yes for some people that works but some it just doesn't and they turn out to be pregnant! It sounds to me like you are hun!!!! WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO TAKE A TEST?!?!?!? ull have 2 keep me posted!!!!! I am hoping you get your BFP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! TONS OF BABY DUST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Fh4B88ZGaa	If it's early "each month" then it's not really early, that's your schedule.<br>  <br>  If you were late one month but still got your period, you are not pregnant.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	It's not early each month if you get it at the same time each month. That means you are regular. It's also very very normal and very very common to be late sometimes. Of course if you think you may be pregnant it's best to just take a test.|`|xWyXbsw6aa	if you have been having unprotected sex then its possible - but periods never do what they are supposed to ! wait until next month before you worry about it... or take a preggo test - what've you got to lose?<br>  <br>  you can still have your period if you are pregnant... its not that uncommon to have it still....<br>  <br>  but i'd say you should be ok, but if you are worried then go get a sneaky pregnant test just to clear your mind.|`|PeEIuzP5aa	Yes, i was the same way one moth it would come early and the next it would be late. it depends on your body and you, if you are stressed out a lot then ya, but don't get down on your self because of this it is normal.<br>  good luck.
CdJtH0xdaa	She might have to go to jail. This is a really serious situation. Whatever happens to her, she needs to learn about what happens to criminals who do this. Maybe a few years in jail will straighten her up, because this is serious.|`|aac7c6d4d79683e9cae0fe6a541bbccdaa	She started a fire.  It makes no difference if her dad presses charges or not, that is arson and is a felony crime.  Charges will most likely be filed regardless of how the father feels.<br>  <br>  I am sure that if she had a mental evaluation, the results of that will be taken into consideration along with her history-grades, behavior and the like.  They will determine what is the best course of action, including what kind of sentence.|`|lTsPX04jaa	thats what she gets for beinga moron. she is going to have to learn some day|`|1thzSbS8aa	It is a criminal matter. Arson is an extremely serious crime, a felony. It is not up to the dad to decide whether he will or won't press charges, it is up to the district attorney.<br>  <br>  Chances are she would be charged as a juvenile. If she were over 18, she would be facing huge fines and years in prison.|`|Fm7z09Kwaa	Girl your friend is a threat for the community and for herself, thank God the fire didn't spread out, she could had killed someone, I don't think it matters if her dad presses charges or not, i think the city itself is gonna press charges and she's likely to be locked up till she's 21.|`|d7kGopYxaa	Wow shes a psycho... don't interact with her.|`|91jTS7Epaa	Whether or not this is normal for her, she needs help.  Wherever the system has her right now is for the best because if she snapped (whether it was building up or sudden), she needs help.

Sometimes you might be under stress and not know it. I honestly have no explanation for this weirdness but i wish you the best with trying to concieve!|`|CluUMpHwaa	I would just go to the doctor.

I dont know how your dealing with all this but i imagine its tough. Good luck though!|`|BCNsuqgRaa	Well, I myself could never condone to abortions.

OBVIOUSLY YOU CAN'T CARE FOR THE CONSEQUENCES!|`|L9Yzg5IWaa	I hope you've been checked by your doctor already.  You have to take RU 486 before you're 8 weeks pregnant.  Otherwise you'll have to have a tradtional abortion.  If you're under 18 you might have to get Mom or Dad to sign off on the abortion too.  So you need to get organized ASAP!<br>  <br>  Here's some info about the abortion pill:  <a href="http://www.fwhc.org/abortion/medical-ab.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.fwhc.org/abortion/medical-ab....</a><br>  <br>  Continuting or ending the pregnancy shouldn't be related to wheter he "kinda cares"  about you.  This decision should be made independent of his emotional attachment to you.  I wouldn't worry about if he'll "hate you".  If he loves you, he would have already asked you to marry him.  <br>  <br>  In the long run you are the one who has to make the decision and live with the consequences of that decision.  If you don't want to carry this child to term you need to act quickly, but you need to make sure it's what YOU want to do.  <br>  <br>  Just remember that you are making a decision about a potetnial life that is already growing inside you.  You aren't making a decision about keeping or breaking up with a boyfriend.<br>  <br>  Now if you aren't ready to end the pregnancy because you want to play the "does he love me game."  Then you need to have a heart to heart with yourself about adoption.  I'm assuming that if you want to abort that you don't want to raise the child either.  Talk to an adoption agency in your area.  <br>  <br>  Make sure you are comfortable with whatever decision you make.  You'll always second guess it (abortion, adoption, or raising the child).- <br>  You need to make sure it's what YOU want to do.  Don't worry about what he thinks or if he still will "like" you.<br>  <br>  I would't tell him anything.  If he wants to know he'll contact you.<br>  <br>  And no I don't think he'll want to be friends.  People either want to be in a relationship or they don't.  If he loved you he'd marry you.

9580a1e44dd3d2bae7d2f867611ab353aa	? He will eventually get interested in solids, keep offering it to him, but don't force the issue either. A few bites here in there is fine as his age, since he is still getting his vitamins and main nutrition from his milk. It takes time, be patient.|`|KWJ7ju6qaa	They are just learning to eat at that age, not fully understanding how it works.  Just be patient and keep trying, but don't force it.<br>  <br>  Your 5 month old weighs 20lbs?|`|vue9NOhYaa	Sounds like he still has the tongue thrust reflex, which means he isn't physically ready. (Being 'interested' in you eating doesn't mean he's physically ready, any more than a toddler playing with toy cars is ready to be handed the keys.)<br>  <br>  He's obviously thriving on milk alone, so there's no rush.  If he is able to eat 1-2 bites well, you could offer those 1-2 bites, but stop as soon as he loses interest.  If even those bites are a struggle, just stop for a few weeks.<br>  <br>  He WILL learn to eat.  He's only 5 months old -- most babies dont' even start solids until 6-7 months.|`|1dueLOdvaa	My youngest son was the EXACT same way.<br>  <br>  I stopped feeding him solids for a little while. He wasn't ready yet.<br>  <br>  I started about a month later and he did great.|`|AA10624857	Even though your doctor has given the OK to offer solids this doesn't mean that your son is ready for them. Every baby is different when it comes to making a transition from having only breast milk (or formula) to having some solids introduced to his diet. At only 5 months, he just may not be ready for it yet. Some babies are gung-ho at 4 months eating from a spoon like a pro while others are 9 months old and still refusing solids. The majority of a baby's nutritional needs are met by breast milk (or formula) for the first year of life with solids mostly be used for practice. Babies are born with a tongue-thrust reflex that subsides around 4-6 months. That is what causes food on a spoon to come back out. Since your son is pushing the food back out his tongue thrust reflex is still strong. Forcing him to eat won't do anyone any good so don't do it. Instead, continue to offer him solids. If he isn't taking to it well, wait a couple days or a week then try again. It is rare, but some babies reach their first birthday with little to no interest in solids. Typically, most babies will be eating something other than breast milk (or formula) by the time they are 6-9 months old. Give your son a little time to get used to the idea of solids and the spoon and eventually he'll get the hang of it.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	Of course your baby will learn to eat when he is developmentally ready -unless you actively prevent him!  <br>  <br>  Watching and imitating are normal behaviours, they have nothing to do with being ready for solids, nor does the baby's weight.  Its clear your son still has a tongue thrust reflex and he turns his head that means he's not ready.  Fussing is his way of saying "what, didn't you hear me I don't want it".<br>  <br>  Leave him be, when he is truly ready he will feed himself.  Its obvious he's thriving without solids or he wouldn't be 20lbs.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.askdrsears.com/html/3/T032000.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.askdrsears.com/html/3/T032000...</a><br>  I'm not sure if my baby is ready. Should I try offering solids anyway?Is your baby both ready and willing to try solid foods? Here's how to tell. If your baby eagerly opens his mouth when he sees a spoonful of food coming toward him, he is probably both ready and willing. If he turns away, he's not.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.llli.org/FAQ/solids.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.llli.org/FAQ/solids.html</a><br>  Before that time, you will notice some signs that your baby is changing developmentally, in preparation for beginning solids in a few months. You will notice that:<br>  <br>      * he becomes more sociable, playing and holding "conversations" with you during a nursing session<br>      * he has a growth spurt and nurses more frequently for a while<br>      * he imitates the chewing motions you make whilst eating -- he is practicing!<br>  <br>  You will know that he is really ready to start solids when:<br>  <br>      * he is about six months old<br>      * he can sit up without any support<br>      * he continues to be hungry despite more frequent nursing which is unrelated to illness or teething<br>      * he has lost the tongue-thrusting reflex and does not push solids out of his mouth<br>      * he can pick up things with his finger and thumb (pincer grasp)<br>  <br>  Babies who are ready for solids can usually feed themselves. Mothers often report that they knew their babies were ready when they picked up food from a plate, chewed it, swallowed it, and wanted more.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://askdrsears.com/faq/bf4.asp" rel="nofollow">http://askdrsears.com/faq/bf4.asp</a><br>   I also have found that some infants are not developmentally ready for solids until 8 or 9 months. You can click here to read about what signs to watch for to determine when your infant is ready for foods. Breast milk is nutritionally complete for at least the first year of life. This means that infants can go for at least a year on breast milk alone, without eating any foods, and be nutritionally complete. Offering foods between 6 and 12 months of age is simply for social development and to get infants used to eating.<br>  <br>  I encourage parents not to try to coax their 6 month old into accepting solids before he shows many of the signs of being ready. This can create a picky eater and negative feelings about eating. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/nutrition/solids/solids-when.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/nutrition/solids...</a><br>  Signs that indicate baby is developmentally ready for solids include:<br>  <br>      * Baby can sit up well without support.<br>      * Baby has lost the tongue-thrust reflex and does not automatically push solids out of his mouth with his tongue.<br>      * Baby is ready and willing to chew.<br>      * Baby is developing a “pincer” grasp, where he picks up food or other objects between thumb and forefinger. Using the fingers and scraping the food into the palm of the hand (palmar grasp) does not substitute for pincer grasp development.<br>      * Baby is eager to participate in mealtime and may try to grab food and put it in his mouth.<br>  <br>  We often state that a sign of solids readiness is when baby exhibits a long-term increased demand to nurse (sometime around 6 months or later) that is unrelated to illness, teething pain, a change in routine or a growth spurt. However, it can be hard to judge whether baby’s increased nursing is related to readiness for solids. Many (if not most) 6-month-old babies are teething, growth spurting and experiencing many developmental changes that can lead to increased nursing – sometimes all at once! Make sure you look at all the signs of solids readiness as a whole, because increased nursing alone is not likely to be an accurate guide to baby’s readiness.<br>  <br>  [...]<br>  <br>  There are many myths and outdated information regarding how to tell if baby is ready for solids.<br>  MYTH: Baby's weight has reached a "magic" number<br>  <br>  Just because your baby achieves "x" number of pounds, or has doubled birth weight, (or however much your baby weighs) does not mean that she is automatically ready for solids - particularly if she is under 6 months.<br>  <br>  The American Academy of Pediatrics/World Health Organization recommendations for starting solids at 6 months or later has no exceptions for babies who weigh more. The research that I've seen on the health benefits of starting solids at 6 months and later holds for all babies, no matter what their weight.<br>  <br>  It's the maturity of the digestive tract and baby's developmental readiness that makes the difference, not baby's weight.<br>   <br>  <br>  It's rather interesting to note that moms are told to start solids for both big and small babies. It's not even uncommon to hear opposite arguments for both sides from the same person!<br>  MYTH: "Your baby is big so you need to start solids."<br>  <br>  Moms might be told to start solids for differing reasons when they have a large baby.<br>  <br>  Some are told that since baby is big, they won't be able to produce enough milk to satisfy baby. This is quite untrue - almost all mothers have the ability to produce enough milk to exclusively breastfeed twins and even triplets. If you allow your baby to nurse on cue, your body will make enough milk for your baby.<br>  <br>  Other moms are told that baby is eating too much, so mom should reduce baby's intake by limiting nursing and/or starting solids. There is absolutely NO evidence that a large breastfed baby will become a large child or adult, and limiting nursing can be quite dangerous for a baby. Read more here: Is my exclusively breastfed baby gaining too much weight?<br>   <br>  MYTH: "Your baby is small so you need to start solids."<br>  <br>  Another reason often given for starting solids is because baby is small (see Normal Growth of Breastfed Babies). I really don't see the sense in this. Ounce for ounce, breastmilk has more calories than most baby-safe solid foods and significantly more nutrients than any type of solid food that you can feed your baby. In addition, starting solids will quite possibly reduce the amount of milk that your baby is getting overall, rather than increase overall intake. One of the first recommendations for a baby who genuinely has slow weight gain is to decrease or eliminate solid foods and nurse more often. <br>  <br>  [...]<br>  <br>  Is there a "window of opportunity" for starting solids?<br>  <br>  There is certainly a "window of opportunity" for starting solids, but this varies widely from baby to baby. At some point (usually around 6-8 months) baby will become developmentally ready to eat solid foods (able to sit up, chew, pick up food, etc.). At around the same age, the gastrointestinal tract is physiologically mature enough to handle a diversity of foods. At this point, most healthy babies will be ready and willing to eat (even if it's only occasionally and in tiny amounts).<br>  <br>  Occasionally, parents will be told that baby must start solids by 6 months (or 8 months, or 10 months) or baby will have problems learning to accept and eat foods that require chewing. This "limited window of opportunity" idea is widely believed, but unproven.<br>  <br>  I've not been able to find any research data to support the idea that there is a limited window of opportunity for introducing solids in normally developing, healthy children. There does appear to be some limited evidence that babies who have been tube-fed long-term or have serious developmental delays may have problems learning to eat if they don't get a chance to practice eating solids between 6 & 10 months. A small study involving case studies of several mentally retarded children was done back in 1964 (Illingworth RS, Lister J. The critical or sensitive period, with special reference to certain feeding problems in infants and children. J Pediatr 1964;65(6) part 1:839-48.). This study suggested that there may be a "critical and/or sensitive" period for introducing chewable textures to these children, and if solids are not introduced during this time, an important developmental milestone may be missed (possibly leading to rejection of solids later on). This study is the only one I've found referenced with regard to the "limited window of opportunity" claims regarding the normal development of children.<br>  <br>  I asked a speech & language pathologist I know about her experiences with this. She has worked with many young children who have feeding problems, including developmental delays and problems with chewing and oral texture aversion. She said that she could not think of any reason that delaying solids would cause feeding problems, and said that the the problems in the children she had worked with had generally started at birth or relatively soon after. None of these children had a feeding problem caused by a delayed start to solid foods.|`|97nXJF24aa	don't force him if his not ready his not ready|`|zRQmWC5saa	no b/c their lil stomachs have not delveloped yet, u can make his stomach hurt and have some kind of disabilty later in life. u can try something  like a half jar of applesauce but dont try different foods all at once.
bMvAmMTaaa	yes i think you tested too early. it is a minimum of 2 weeks b4 pregnancy can be detected, but that's even pushing it. take it around the 16th march onwards and that should be a more accurate result.|`|OuuYoSBeaa	yep you tested to early. dont test any early then monday if you want a more accurate result... some even take up to a week or two after a missed period to get the positve.|`|lwaSJn3Gaa	yeah you did...wait till it gets closer to your period. to get the best accurate answer test the day of your missed period or a day after because by then the hcg hormone will be detected|`|5puE2Qfpaa	Yes, so now I would get a 5 day test that has 2 in the box so that way if your curiosity gets the best of you. You can take one Saturday then if negative take the other one Monday.|`|Fh4B88ZGaa	Too early. You need to wait at least a week after implantation, or about two weeks after intercourse. Wait until the weekend and test again.
nmu6coapaa	I know exactly how you feel! It's got to the point where I get nervous when it's nearing feeding time b/c I dont know if he's going to take it or not! I really dont know what to tell you, we just try to settle him down as much as possible and shh him while he's sucking the bottle!|`|EmYNUZcXaa	i was told by my pediatrician to feed her in an upright position and not to lay her down on her back for a good 15-20 minutes. our dr. also said that there really isn't much you can do about it other than that. she'll eventually grow out of it. my daughter is 3 months old next week and still has reflux. its not nearly as bad as it used to be, but she still has it. our dr. said babies can have it as long as 9-12 months of age. i'm pretty used to it by now...it usually gets more on me than anything else lol. hang in there!!|`|DDFSITiYaa	Is it true reflux?  Is she on medication?  Reflux is when the stomach acid is over produced and backs up into the esophagas and throat causing burning and pain.  Babies anticipate the feeding which causes the stomach to react by starting up the acids that will be needed for digestion.  <br>  <br>  Putting her on Zantac per your ped will inhibit some of the acid production which will lessen the amount in the stomach.  Once we started this with my son, it was much easier to feed him.  <br>  <br>  Just also too, if you position her differently on the side that causes her more reaction, it may help.  It may be on that particular side she in a position that causes more back up.|`|M9mjCEQpaa	Yes the first poster is correct!  Also on your lap if you bounce your knees and rub their back too!  Also what else works is go to the store and buy a bouncy seat that costs like 25 dollars at Target and it has a vibrator in it.  My son loved that and it helped him so much.  He is way better now and doesn't cry all the time like he did in the beginning.   Plus this gives you more time to move about and get things done.  My pediatrician gave us some medicine too.  Also he put my son on Alimentum, the most expensive formula, but only until he is six months and it has helped so much!!!|`|OBU1eDUHaa	Is she on medication?  Do you prop her up after feedings for at least 20 minutes?  I know my daughter will seem like she's doing great for a couple of weeks and then she starts crying/arching her back again.  We go to the MD who tells us she's gained enough weight that she needs a higher dose of her medicine.  Once we give her the higher dose, she seems fine.  Have you cut everything out of your diet that you can?  Spicy food, onions, tomatoes, broccoli, etc?  I know when I do eat those things the next day it does bother her.  My son had to have 2 medications, not just one.  Maybe your daughter needs one.  Good luck!|`|oA8Rtyxuaa	make sure you don't lay her down flat after her feedings for at least 15 minutes, this helps the food digest a little and helps it not come back up as much. Good luck!|`|AA10226047	One person told me to hold the baby like a football (lay her flat on your arm with her stomach down) and then rock her like that.  It helped them.  Also someone else told me to get a big rubber ball (the kind that pregnant women sit on when they are in labor) and lay her on her stomach and rock it back in forth.
onPm56glaa	It sounds as though it could be her teeth, just because you cant feel teeth, does not mean that they are not there!  However, if you are giving her liquid ibuprofen and that is not making any difference, then I would suggest that it is not her teeth!  I have used liquid ibuprofen on both my girls 2 & 10 months, for teething, and I have found it to be fantastic! Because it is an anti-inflammetry, it takes the pain right away!  Also, it is around this age that they start to experience seperation anxiety, which would mean they would cry when you leave the room and be all happy again when you return!  If this is whats happening it is nothing to worry about, it will pass, you just have to reassure her that you are coming back, although this would not make her cry in her sleep all night.  The only other thing that springs to mind is that she might be hungry, is she getting enough food/milk during the day?  Is she going through a growth spurt perhaps?  The only time my girls ever cried through the night (after they started sleeping through) was when they were teething or growth spurts or were hungry due to teething cause they would not eat meals during day so they were hungry at night.  When this happened, I just gave them extra milk to make up for the solids they were not eating!   If it has been going on for 5-6 weeks, maybe you should take her to the doctor, rather be safe than sorry!  Hope this helps|`|cUJbhspDaa	our 2 year old cries all the time and is dead clingy|`|IPoaeWXPaa	Probably just teething and maybe she's just at the age where she doesn't want to be left in the room alone so thats why she cries when u go out the room. My son is 8 months old and cries when i leave the room but he just gets told to shut it (lol not really!) but i just leave him crying as i'm not wanting him to get used to me running to his every whim every time he turns on the water works, it might sound cruel but he is just doing it for attention as when i do go and see what he's cryinig for as soon as he sees me he starts to laugh which makes me laugh cause he's so cute! I know it can be v v frustrating but also if u htink its his teeth buy some ashtons and parsons, it works wonders!!|`|SLph9RX6aa	my 7 month old has recently started behaving in the same way, i'm sure its teething, he has never sucked his thumb now its always in his gob and he is chewing away. ashton and parsons is good, when it gets really bad at night i give him baby paracetamol. during the day when he is constantly whining we go for lots of walks. i am praying for those teeth to come|`|EzTh60uIaa	i tend to think it could be her teeth, is her mouth watering a lot....but YOU need some time out for yourself. can you get a relative to take her for just a few hours a week.|`|q4rG5Dwtaa	could it be her ears? I know mine whined alot and I brought him to the Dr. and he had a bad ear infection. He's also teething too so that made it even worse.
1795e9adbd644bbbce946795cd052957aa	Most children drink supplemental milk after age one, even if they continue nursing.  There's no harm in letting your child have human milk for as long as she needs it.  There's probably no harm in letting them have supplemental milk either.  There was with my daughter though.  Cows milk constipated her.  If I were to do it again, I'd skip the cows milk and only breastfeed.<br>  <br>  My daughter weaned at at four and a half years.  I have not seen, nor experienced any downsides to letting her choose her time in weaning.  it's only been beneficial, and I would definately let another child self-wean.<br>  <br>  To respond to some of the other comments;  older nurslings eat regular foods just like children who drink cows milk do.  The difference is in the source of the milk.  Remember, cows milk is the substitute; breastmilk is what the child is expecting.  Also, children past the age of two definately still need their mothers; for comfort and nourishment.  I sang lullabies and rocked and cuddled and kissed and hugged my children; all the of above for my 10 yo son last evening (he weaned at age one and had attachment issues for it).  Is it fair to tell a child that they can no longer have kisses, because they are old enough to shake their hands?  Someday, they will reach an age where hand shakes and hugs replace kisses (maybe), but we, as parents usually let them guide that decision.  Why is it different with nursing.  At age two, they still rely on us for nourishment too, and to make choices for them in their nourishment.  Bovine milk or human milk for human children?  It's amazing how society has caused us to lose all sense of logic and common sense here.|`|YuVSDBkzaa	I weaned my daughter one month before turning two. My mom BF my youngest sister until she was three and I have another friend who nursed her son until he was 3 1/2. They all started eating solids and drinking juice after age one and they still wanted to nurse. The only thing I noticed about extended BF (and this is not to say EVERY child will be like this, only the my sister and my friends son were like this) is that the children remember quite well and tend to talk and want to touch the breast. My sister would even do this with other woman, it was like she developed a fetish for it (I know, it sounds weird. It took several months for her to break this habit). The last time I visited my friends house, her 4 year old son made a comment about my boobs. Apparently, I bent over and he saw some cleavage. <br>  <br>  Then again, many people are saying "oh, there's nothing wrong with nudity, we should be more open about it and not make our children feel ashamed about their bodies, just look at the Europeans. They have public nudity and they're fine!" So if these same people who say that nudity is fine and then gawk at breastfeeding, you can tell them to shove it up their...<br>  <br>  Personally, I'll nurse my child until he is 2 if I can.|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	I let my children wean themselves and they all chose 3 yrs old to stop|`|eu6UQElYaa	In our culture it's not really best to breastfeed up to 8 years.   Past 6 months you don't need to breastfeed exclusively you add other forms of food and other drinks to the baby's diet so I'd say other milk supplements (or at this point even regular milk) would be just fine.   <br>  Breastfeeding for very prolonged periods (past age 2) can get complicated if you want the child to attend preschool or daycare etc.   Otherwise it's basically your choice.   I'm just not sure there is enough of a medical benefit to pursue it much past age 2 and it does carry a pretty hefty social stigma past age 2.|`|haabfMtkaa	I agree this is your baby and your body!! You will know when your baby is ready. I breast fed all my kids till about 2 & 1/2 . That is when they are almost ready for pre school and they really weren't feeding but at night and I think it was more for the comfort of it(witch I feel is perfectly okay). When your baby is feeding less and getting her nutrients from food and such you will know. She will start needing to feed less and using the breast for Comfort just like a bottle or pacifier use your mommy instinct. Don't let anyone make you uncomfortable for giving your baby a HUGE head start.!|`|xIlIbZJtaa	I demand breastfed ours up to around age 2 1/2 yrs because that happens to be when it felt about the right time to stop for each of them. Only you know when is right for you and your child. Many people thought that 2 1/2 was too old, especially for the twins, but it was right for us so that's what we did. <br>  One thing to consider is the social stigma of a child having a blanket, dummy, or breastfeed at school age and whether they will be affected by it. If you think they won't, then fine.<br>  The funny thing is that as your child grows, so do you and so does your relationship, which means that how you envisage two years time is not usually how it actually turns out to be. So even if you can't imagine not breastfeeding your child aged 4, when thay actually get to that age you might not dream of doing it.<br>  I think you are doing a great job - it's excellent to mix milk as your daughter is getting the best of both. <br>  Just be sure not to get exhausted and maybe take a supplement as well as a healthy diet. Even though you rarely realise while you are doing it, breastfeeding does put that extra demand on your body, especially as the childs appetite increases with age.|`|yJ7X3oEdaa	My daughter was 18 months when I stopped. My son is now 9 months and I plan on going at least another 9 months! Go as long as your feel comfy! Don't let negative people change your mind! You are her mother and you know what is right for her!|`|axOJ2XUIaa	Not past two.  They need solid food then.  Not 3 or 4.   Breastfeeding is only really important for the colostrum in the first 3 days.  8 years old is totally gross.  Who told your that?  That's crazy.  Maybe someone in a third world country.  I just saw a story on the news about a woman who is breastfeeding her 5 year old and they thought it was awful.  So do I.  When a child becomes a thinking, feeling person, you should have privacy from them.  Besides they don't really need you for that anymore past 2, do they?
zSABr7praa	Maybe!  My doctor wouldn't try before 12 weeks because he said women get so concerned (rightfully) if they can't hear one.  You will get blood work done again to check all sorts of things, including your HGC levels, so don't worry, your pregnancy will be re-confirmed!<br>  <br>  Morning/afternoon/night sickness didn't subside for me until I was 13 weeks.  They actually were at their peak awfulness between 8 and 12 weeks.<br>  <br>  Best of luck and congrats!|`|Ccq8zEcnaa	It will be very hard to her the heartbeat this early with the doppler... But you should be able to hear the placenta pumping oxygen and nutrition to the baby. <br>  <br>  You may not start improving with your morning sickness until you reach the second trimester, which starts at 14 weeks. And then after that some women still do experience morning sickness as hormone spikes occur late in the third trimester. If you think you are sick with a bug, get your doctor to check you out.. but usually you would have fever accompanied with the nausea and throwing up.|`|d6dzoHvvaa	You might be able to hear the heart beat, I heard mine at 11 weeks but dont be surprised or upset if they do check and you can't hear it, it might still be too soon to hear it. As far as the morning sickness goes, everybody is different, I had bad morning sickness from about 5 weeks up until the second trimester and it has subsided but every once in a while I get nauseas in the morning still.|`|vGHaYp6Naa	you should be able to. i wouldnt know for sure, my first appt was when i was 16 wks.|`|hXoUFWL1aa	we heard the heartbeat at 10 weeks so you might be able to.|`|n86nMfbtaa	You should be able to hear it... however, each doctor runs their practice differently. I heard my baby's heartbeat at my first prenatal visit (: and I even heard them tumbling around in my belly!<br>  <br>  For the rest of the first trimester, it just depends. Each woman is different... but from experience, I had my good and bad weeks. Some weeks I'd go without feeling sick but maybe once or twice, others I was always at the toilet gagging and hardly threw up. Hopefully, you just have gagging if you DO feel sick. It's a lot better than throwing up your breakfast (:|`|963a60ad2fe21d7cef6dc7185c595623aa	You might be able to hear it, but if you can't don't worry.  Before 12 weeks it is normal not to be able to hear the heartbeat on doppler.  Also, the nausea usually improves after about 13 weeks.|`|9osFXKPyaa	THANKS A GOOD QUESTION I JUST FOUND OUT I AM 4 WEEKS AND 4 DAYS PREGNANT AND I FEEL EVERY BIT OF SICKNESS....LOL I'M HOPING IT STOP BY NINE WEEKS|`|vU4haA31aa	Yes I heard my babies heart beat on my first visit....i hope you hear yours too its a once in a lifetime experience....may bring tears of joy to your eyes!|`|AA11542929	If they do an ultrasound yea.. and maybe.. i was 11 weeks when i had a nasty flu.. but i managed to get thru it..stick to water and stay hydrated|`|UDENYO4raa	There's no way of knowing whether or not you'll be able to hear the heartbeat.. I went into the hospital at 6 weeks 4 days when they confirmed my pregnancy, and didn't go see the doctor until I was 18 weeks because our insurance didn't kick in until then. When they put the doppler on my belly, they couldn't hear the heartbeat, and she said we'd do an ultrasound and not to freak out. When she left the room, I looked at my husband and we almost cried, because we were prepared that since it had been so long, it was always a chance... But sure enough, when they pulled her up on that screen she was bouncing all over and they found a strong heartbeat! I HEARD it on the doppler that she put on my belly for the first time when I was 24 weeks. I know.. It's one of the most amazing sounds ever, and it stinks that you might have to wait so long!<br>  <br>  As for the sickness.. I have to say that I didn't get my sickness until I was about 7 weeks pregnant and it got worse and worse... It doesn't really get better until at least the first weeks of your second tri-mester normally... I got better around 14-15 weeks. Even now, I still have to run to the bathroom sometimes, even if there's barely anything that comes up. I constantly gag at certain things, and if you're used to morning sickness, you never know if that's gonna actually come up. Haha.<br>  <br>  Good Luck and Congrats! :)|`|kaqPSgTVaa	You MAY be able to hear the heartbeat. If they just use a hand held dopplar then probably not because your uterus is still tucked under your pelvic bone and it's pretty hard to pick it up.<br>  <br>  I'm on my second pregnancy. With my first I had morning sickness the first few months but never really threw up. With my current I've been nauseous 3 or 4 times and it's all been after the 8 week mark. Pregnancy symptoms aren't set in stone. It's very possible to get a little morning sickness a little later in the first trimester or even the first few weeks of the second.
J5TbYvVZaa	I was struck by your word clever to describe him. That's my son and we started potty training the beginning of January. I knew I would have to take a somewhat different approach because he's so clever. So everything I did, I did making him think he was making the decision. I started a week ahead of time telling my son (28mo) that he was going to get to go potty in 7 days. We counted down- everyday reminding him that in X days he was going to get to go potty. On the day before we started, I let him help me color a potty chart and let him pick out the stickers for it. We even went to the store to pick out what treats he wanted. I also had him help me put things in his 'potty box' - puzzles, books, trucks that went in the bathroom. I had already purchased underwear and put them in his drawer - where he could reach so he could pick them out. On the morning of the big day, we put all his diapers in a box for the baby (his little brother) and took them out of his room. We used a timer the first few days, so he knew that when the timer went off we were heading to the potty. We bought a child urinal - Peter Potty. We had both pottys in there and told him he could pick which one he wanted to use. The first couple days were accident after accident. When he asked for a diaper, I reminded him they were gone. By day 4 he was accident free. We did dances and sang songs when he went. He also got to call daddy, grandmas, friends when he went. He really thought that was neat. We put on 'nite nite pants' (goodnights pullups) and never said diaper again. The other thing I did was keep a log of when he would go to the bathroom and by day 7 we were out and about because I could schedule small errands around his potty schedule. I know all kids are different but I think it really helped him that he was involved in everything and felt like HE WAS MAKING THE DECISION! Good luck and be consistant.|`|Pi8KfmOxaa	lol my son was the same,infact all my kids prefered them stick on seats on the toilet. with my son i got him out in the garden in the summer and he would p in the drain  then he used the toilet|`|p07RwZK2aa	Don't force him. <br>  I suggest buying a special little kids' seat which goes on top of the normal toilet. <br>  Also have you switched from using diapers to 'big boys' pants? That way he will wet himself when he doesn't pee in the toilet and that is a horrible feeling so hopefully he'll stop.|`|cPlDc7I1aa	My son never used the potty to wee in, he wanted to use the toilet (stood up 'just like daddy').  And he refused to poo in the toilet or use the potty.  I was always putting him in a nappy when he needed to poo. But it got to the point where i was getting fed up with using a nappy just because he wanted to poo so i told him enough was enough and if he needed to poo he'd have to go on the potty.  Well, he held himself for 3 days (pacing until the feeling went away) until finally he had no choice but go.  He sat screaming on the potty (with me holding him down!!) but he went in the end.  It was the same the next time, but i bought one of these electronic kiddies keyboards with all the different animal sounds and instrument sounds and distracted him with that while he was 'going'.  I told him he could only play with it when he was going potty (which also resulted in him faking it a few times just so he could play with it  lol!!) After a few rather stressful attempts we got there in the end.   Persevere is all you can do i'm afraid.  <br>  <br>  Best of luck!|`|ovzUvTifaa	I just wanted to second Heather's idea. For his age and his intelligence, you have to work it up. Stop for a little while - maybe a week or so to let it wear down if he really is that upset about it - then make a huge deal about it and build up the excitement. Let him decide that it's a step he wants to take and make him a part of every decision - right down to the undies, the toys and the stickers! :)|`|3dxwK9v3aa	There is no rule that says a child has to be ready to be potty trained at 3 years old or any age for that matter. In my experience, your son will do it when he is ready. Just be sure that you keep showing him what he is suppose to do with his waste and he will do it when he is ready.|`|QbJ04Zqiaa	Tell him he can't go to school like a big boy until he does.|`|MtU2yH3gaa	My daughter is almost 3 and very smart so I was shocked when it was so hard to potty train, but this week I took her to the store and let her pick out big girl undies and a dora potty that hooks onto the real toilet. Then, we went and she got to pick out 2 goldfish, but I told her she can only keep them if she goes on the potty. I did that on Monday, and she has only had 1 accident since then! I do keep pull ups on her at night until she can get into the groove, but it seems to be working pretty well. Good Luck and stick with it, I know it can be frustrating, but in all honesty, he will do it when he's ready.|`|onPm56glaa	My daughter is 2 years and 3 months old and has been potty trained for just under 3 months.  We told her that if she went in the potty, she would get a chocolate, that is her 'favourite sweet'.  She would get 1 chocolate if she went pee pee in the potty, and 2 chocolates if she went poo in the potty.  We used dairy milk whispers as her treat and it really worked brilliantly, within days she was telling us when she needed to go!  And within 2 weeks she was forgetting to ask for her treat!  When she did not ask for her chocolate, she did not get it! And of course, if she did not go, she did not get!  She tried at times to fool us by saying she needed to go but then did not do anything!|`|ndiIy0vpaa	My sons the same age. I was having the same problem. It does help if you bribe them offer them sweets, stickers and lots of affection to show how proud you are of him. But even still they can still play up. My son was very good he understood what he had to do in two days, which i was shocked as i thought it will will take few weeks before he realises how to hold and to take himself to the loo. <br>  <br>  But i realised its not just all my doing it helps if there are children similar age like brothers, cousins or even friends. As children pick up things quick by watching other children learning and playing even copying what their friends do.|`|SiIuJXvwaa	this is what i done with my two boys, is there a man figure in his life because he can only help him first then you can take over    put a ping pong ball in the toilet make him pee on it you have to make a game out of it or there not interested  or put smarties in to the loo and get him to wash the colour of them and he will be a big boy very quickly and he will want to go up all the time|`|AA11025762	u have to take the plunge.. put him in big boy pants and if he wets them he will learn how horrible and uncomfortable it is..<br>  <br>  this is what i did with my boy<br>  <br>  also he is quite old, so maybe he wants to use the toilet.. with a seat and a step up instead of a potty.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  i just read some of the other answers.. from what i have seen with friends and alike.. never go back.. once u start that is it.. no more nappies except bedtime! otherwise they will know u will give in and they will get to wear a nappy.|`|AMsT9wxbaa	when I trained my children, I would offer them  a couple of m & m's if they did their business on the potty.  Only give them to him when you get results.  just tell him that if he does it, he will get the candies.  good luck!|`|xuSg10Tmaa	Bribe him. I know it sounds aweful, but it helps. If you don't want to bribe him take things away. At my house we have a toy jail. That is were the toys go if one of my kids misbehave. Best of luck.
MxhNzW7Oaa	Awe poor Sean :(<br>  <br>  I probably wouldn't use it but I would call his doctor and see what they say first. I would also tell them them one of them started bleeding and that you can't find anyone to do surgery on him so young.<br>  <br>  What did they other surgeons tell you about what age they would do it?|`|aEpPt9koaa	I wouldnt gived him a pacifier.  You probably should keep everything out of his mouth except food and drink.  If he already has mouth trauma a pacifier would probably make it work.  Just stay on the safe side and not give it to him.|`|ZyXTngiCaa	Hmm...I would think you should ask the Dr. Rosie. I don't know, but kinda have a hunch that it might further aggravate the situation. Hugs to the babby. That is tough!|`|41980ab28e587a42197eea5a921bca4aaa	Yikes!  I think that would probably not be good.  He's 9 months, right?  Maybe its a good time to get him to stop using it.  Poor thing!|`|pXSKSS3daa	Poor little guy! :(<br>  <br>  I'd call his doctor, honestly. The rubber on the nipple while he's sucking on it may cause further trauma.|`|KWJ7ju6qaa	I would think that would only make things worse; but i'm not a doctor, so it's just my motherly opinion.
ovzUvTifaa	I hear you. It is hard being a SAHM because when your child is in daycare they have constant companionship and stimulating activities. At home, it is him and mommy. Your son should be able to play by himself occassionally throughout the day. When you are getting your chores done, involve him if possible. Give him an option: Mommy is going to put the laundry in the washer. Would you like to help me or would you like to play by yourself with your trains? <br>  <br>  My son is just one and it is trying because I have to make meals and snacks, clean them up, wash the dishes, take a shower, do 1-2 loads of laundry per day (etc) and he simply doesn't understand yet. BUT... he is getting a little older. If I am doing something that he can't help with (or can't understand not to mess with - like when I'm sweeping stuff off the floor or unloading glasses from the dishwasher) then I walk with him to his room and play for 5 minutes then say "I will be doing x and will play again when I'm done." He doesn't always understand and sometimes I have to walk him back to his room - but he's beginning to. I let him play by himself when I have to take a shower as well (in a ridiculously childproof room, of course, with a monitor turned on). There are things like sorting laundry and picking up toys that kids can definitely help with though. :)<br>  <br>  If you're anything like me, you will always feel guilty when you tell your son you're busy. I feel like I'm at home to be a "Mom" and give my son quality time all the time, but there are other things that go into being a mom - like keeping your home clean and safe & having food on the table for him to eat. He will learn that and if you include him then he will learn that cleanup/showering/etc are regular parts of everyday life - for you AND him.|`|Q0ExafZzaa	Shouldn't he be in kindergarten at age three? He needs some structure in his life, and so do you. Learn to manage your time more effectively. Stopping every 30 minutes whatever you are doing is not good. You have some grown-up responsibilities, after all. You probably feel a bit lost losing your job recently. Good luck in getting back on track.|`|1enIWBGnaa	Give him chores to do while you're doing yours.  There's no reason in the world why he should NOT be helping.  STOP allowing him to interrupt you.  Sit down with him and tell him YOU are the boss and he needs to do things on his own.  Plus, you will set aside time, each day, for just one-on-one with him.|`|vCq3dR40aa	As much as possible, involve him in your chores.  He can mix things when you cook, vacuum, sweep, dust, help set the table (start with one piece of silverware at a time and after a few days add another one.) Pick up his toys, unload some of the dish washer. . .   As you complete these chores, you can include counting, sorting, pattern recognition, large and small muscle control, colors, just about anything. <br>  <br>  The benefit to this is he is kept busy and isn't making his own mess.  <br>  <br>  He can even do his paperwork.  Coloring picture for Daddy, drawing, painting with pudding paints - great snack time activity.<br>  <br>  Just don't worry if he doesn't do an excellent job.<br>  Then you will have time to play together.|`|MUVdG9n1aa	Since he is three you can try and involve him in what you are doing. Kids love to be included. You can have him help put the clothes from the dryer into the basket, pick up toys, dry (plastic) cups and spoons. Obviously he will not be much in the way of actual help but it keeps him entertained and lets you do get things done, especially if you make it fun, like a game. You can set him up at the kitchen table with crayons and paper while you clean, or outside with chalk on the sidewalk if you want to garden...|`|cyytemq5aa	Seeing that your child is three years old I would include him while you're completing your chores. I take my child around the house with me while I'm my chores. While I'm doing laundry I give them the socks to match up, while I'm dusting I give them a rag and have them dust big things like the couch or a chair, while I clean the bathroom I have them wash thier bath toys in the sink. I can always find something for them to do that is "helping" me. By doing this they learn responsibilty and they feel that they are really doing something with me, I always make it fun for them and they end up really getting something out of it in the end. If they don't like the task at hand I let them choose another activity to do, but I tell them that mommy wants to finish her chore before she can play, usually they want to help so I finish faster. I don't think there's any set time limit that's acceptable or not acceptable when it comes to time with your children, any time you give them is valuable. No one is going to say Oh you spent five minutes less with them today then yesterday therefore your a bad parent. As long as you make the time count (telling them you love them and really focusing on them) that you do spend with them that's all that really matters.|`|hKJIDdVqaa	yeah see I do not play with my children, very rarely did I ever play with them. I did not want to hamper their creativity with toys and such. I also wanted to raise them with independence in occupying themselves. Also that is the reason we had 3 kids, so they could play with each other. I read to them, sang to them, rocked them as a way of spending quality time together.  I help them with homework, go to their practices and games, talk with them, and we have dinner together.  But I very rarely 'played'  I was just never into being an entertainment staff. Certainly quality time is a must, but it cannot be all day.|`|FTFd3AQAaa	best is to have him 'help' you with your chores, now i warn you his help is likely to make things take longer but in the end it is for the best as he will eventually be able to take over chores on his own. when you need to do things he really cant help with... cooking for instance try to get him occupied before you start.. with a craft or tv show or something... also i'm sure that he wants all your attention right now cuz it is new to him to have you home all day
OCf7y5FKaa	I don't mean to compare, but it may help you to know: I am 16 - in 6 daays - and159cm.<br>  I believe I was 1.55m this time last year - at 14/15 years old.<br>  <br>  Are you male? My brother, 14y/o is 1.60m (1cm taller than mee), but then againnn boys are usually taller.<br>  In conclusion, I think you are very average, although there is a gargantuamn range of male 14y/o heights. Are you okay in yourself?|`|Fm7z09Kwaa	Your normal, and you're still in growing age so you will get taller than that in due time.|`|dDHtziQEaa	are you talking about your penis?|`|Mapm6AI8aa	ur just a tad short but ur fine...    :D|`|yGmHLe91aa	Ur very normal !! im 15 years old and im 1m70 last year i was 1m63 maybe..<br>  <br>  Hope it will help
e1fb375e8479e5154875d80338c91e3aaa	I'm curious as to the reasoning for the Lovenox.  This is a anticoagulant, or blood thinner.  How does this prevent a recurrence of pre-eclampsia?<br>  <br>  ETA:  That makes sense.  Unfortunately, this is the first time I have heard about that so I can't be of much help.  I wish you and the little one well!
8026ec062aaa229b35c5aceb76a16035aa	Some babies have different thermostats. My son is also always hot and has been this way since he was a baby. He is 5 now and usually he gets in the door and by the time he makes it to the kitchen (which is 5 ft away) he is down to his underwear. The boy hates clothes and still stays hot. We used to let him play in his diaper all the time and of course all the older people in my family insisted that he would catch pneumonia, but he has never had it and is a thriving healthy and happy naked little boy.|`|1c264470699c75f9ef21a75b4682539eaa	If he sleeps and wakes wet with sweat, it is a sure sign that he is dreaming intense physical activity. He is experiencing sub-conscience answers to conscience emotions. Real-time response to his conscience needs, in a satisfactory way, will quell his sub-conscience activity and slow the confusion of physical and mental growth. Engage your child more succinctly, with progression as the keynote to imbibe.This strategy is difficult for parents who like to dwell on matters of reflection and civic posturing. Now is not the time for such foolishness.Priority #1 is to meet and exceed your child's every destination of physical and mental prowess. He will challenge you at every moment to expand his capacity for experience. It is up to you to maintain the progression he demands as necessary to give him solice.|`|bf6fb0f4caadf24cfa826edc2cc32d3baa	You just want to make sure that you don't have him covered up too much or have him it too warm of clothing. My son has been the same way at times. Even if his arms or legs feel a bit cool to the touch, it doesn't mean that he is cold. You can feel of his chest to see if he is cold or not. If he is too hot it can also make him sick. Many times it is easy to think that as babies they need to be covered at all times, but this is not always so.|`|jivtit0Eaa	I am not real sure but is he teething. that could possibly be the problem.|`|tx8OTfFUaa	During the summer months, my husband and my son cannot sit together as the heat they generate together makes them both sweat BIG TIME!!  My husband is hot generally and his son is as well!|`|LhV8D2Xeaa	My friends son is always really hot when my son is just normal. i think some people are warm blooded and sweat more that others.  just put him in a cool cotton tee.|`|n3g9j1dHaa	ohh some kids are just hot natured. my 9 month old is like that too ill be cold and his back will be all sweaty and sometimes his temp is 9 usually alot! and they say some babies are jsut like that. my mom said my brother was the same way always just soo warm!
WXExyAlWaa	There are a few possibilities - they recommend you take a test with your first morning urine to get enough hormones, so it's possible the later one was a false negative and your "period" is actually implantation bleeding. Or there could be something else going on that caused a false positive. You could either take another one first thing in the morning, or go to the doctor for a blood test and ideas on what else it could be.|`|Tvcn83Adaa	You should see your doctor.  It sounds like a very early miscarriage.  False positives are very rare.<br>  <br>  If you are TTC, you may have a hormone issue and will need to take hormones as soon as you have a positive test to prevent a miscarriage.|`|LY2LSzPJaa	I have never heard of a false postive , only negative!<br>  call doc and get a blood test , or take 2 more and see , if you get more than 1 positive , then you are preggers|`|yRAU9MJDaa	Anything is possible.  Good Luck.|`|Heyz3xp9aa	you should see a doctor because you may have a different health issue, other than pregnancy|`|hNIof0lbaa	Sometimes that happens...one of my friends experienced the same thing as you. She actually took the positive test wrong. Those tests are very sensitive.. Also, did you have unprotected sex? If your really worried, give your doc a call and set a gyno apt up to be looked at! good luck|`|kaqPSgTVaa	You should see a doctor. It may have been a false positive (those are rare) or you could be having an early miscarriage.

Grab any valuables you can find and kidnap their youngest child. Take the time to write a ransom note from their own stationary. Feed the child canned pineapple from their own fridge for good measure. Take the child to a secure location and abuse it. When the ransom is paid, throw the body into the Thames River, and then flee to Mexico.|`|S2lIklhmaa	be a waitress? or you already tried that... they get really good pay i think
1thzSbS8aa	Normal, normal, and normal.<br>  <br>  It's old blood, you're just a bit irregular, and most girls get cramps.<br>  <br>  Just don't assume it's over yet, especially if you're cramping.|`|FiUprYsvaa	When I swam I didn't have my period from october till christmas christmas we had 2 weeks off so the physical stress was gone and then once we went back in jan I didn't have my period from january till end of february.|`|9zwSclnLaa	At 15 your periods are probably still just irregular.  It is normal to go months without having them and then once finally getting it again, to only have it for a day and not even.  If you are worried, you can go to the doctor.|`|d397dMRZaa	It could be that your periods are still irregular. Has anything happened recently to cause stress? Don't worry to much about it.|`|Heyz3xp9aa	As very young women sometimes our periods can be irregular from time to time but to be sure I would mention it on my next doctor's visit|`|f7c5471c72f7f084411ee3f3f3e4b818aa	How old are you? If you're a teen then there might be nothing wrong with you. Teen generally have irregular periods. When I was a teen there were times when I had no period for february and march every year. There were other times when I only had it for three days , some when I had it for seven. So don't worry too much. <br>  <br>  Also, I guess your worrying has stressed you about a bit. Especially since it's been three months. The stress can hold it back also. Anyway, if you still feel really pressured talk the school nurse or go to the hospital to the doctor.|`|sQCVoHt6aa	Have you been experiencing any stress lately? Stress can 'cause your body to skip a period or two. <br>  Also, most women (not everyone) experience lighter periods as they grow older, that's very normal, so don't you worry about that!<br>  <br>  Hope I helped!
f1e593fccac158ae80c8df2916388085aa	You just came over to the pregnancy No-no's question and basically kicked all of us in the behind for eating a little junk food here or there and forgetting a prenatal.  Personally, at 5 months, I think it is too much for you.  You should try and slow down a little.  I know you are proud and don't want to take handouts, but this is not about your pride right now, its about your kid and you want to do what is BEST for him/her.|`|bMvAmMTaaa	don't over work yourself, maybe you should cut down ur hours as it could be dangerous to you and ur baby. but use ur better judgment and take it easy! where is the father? he should be helping out so u don't have to work 2 jobs, but good on you for wanting to work and do it without government funding.<br>  <br>  you are an upstanding citizen!<br>  <br>  btw some ppl dont have a choice but to accept help from the government.|`|AA11109728	Technically, it's not recommended, but I did it.  My doctor told me to quit my 2nd job, she said growing the baby was a full time job in itself.  I sat there thinking, ok, yeah right, who's gonna pay my rent?!  I worked similar hours and jobs to you.   An office job full time, 8am-4:30pm, and fast food cashier 6-11pm or whenever I got done.  I was a closer, so I did a lot of walking around, stocking, cleaning, taking care of customers on my own, etc.  I guess that may be why I didn't gain a lot of weight, that was good exercise.  I never had any problems, no 'morning sickness' or anything, so I continued both jobs.  I cut back a day on the part time one eventually, I started getting more tired toward the end.  After I had signs of labor starting I quit the part time job cuz I didn't want to make my baby come sooner than ready - I kept my office job and worked it till the end.|`|WLLqdPXeaa	NO, it is not proper to work for such a longer period. Proper rest and sleep as well as exercise and nutritional diet is a must. Best of luck.|`|Vf4w8dNNaa	I admire you.<br>  I was considering getting a second job for the same reason, pay off old debt and just to have some extra money to spend on my little one on the way.  But honestly, I am too darn tired.  I work 9-5 mon-fri and come home and crash by 8pm.  <br>  Maybe once my energy kick comes in I can find something else, but by that point I think starting a new job would be pointless.<br>  If you can do it, and you feel it's not stressing you out to much I say go for it.|`|yKS2UI87aa	I had two jobs while I was pregnant but my second was only 1-3 nights a week (waitressing) (1st job was sit down) maybe cut down how many days but I don't think you need to quit. You do need to eat more than a salad but not all junk food either. Glad to see you are responsible! Well paying off credit cards will leave you more money per month and saving it will give you money set aside but you will still have your credit card payments. I would save at least one months worth of bill money so when you are off after the baby you have $$ and then use the rest to pay off the cards. Good Luck

Kudos to the parents!|`|kPl8TTzNaa	Taylor Madison - I hope you are a boy. Both Taylor and Madison are masculine boy names. Tailors were always male. Madison means SON of Maude; Matthew's SON. I immediately assume you were a boy, but unfortunately I bet you are a female.<br>  <br>  Katelyn Marie - Horrid, trashy spelling of the lovely Caitlin. Marie is filler and overused as a middle name. Even with the horrible spelling, she is the luckiest of the girls, to get a feminine, some what decent name.<br>  <br>  Arabella Shealyn - Arabella is gorgeous. Shealyn is made up and Shea is masculine.<br>  <br>  Bailee Rayne - Bailey is a masculine boy's name, regardless of the trashy spelling. Rain is horrible enough, at least spell it right.<br>  <br>  Caden Riley - Nice. Not a fan of the trendy Caden. At least your parents got his gender correct.<br>  <br>  Asher Keith - Love Asher. Not a fan of Keith. At least you parents got his gender correct.|`|ByVkqiSCaa	Cool names, except Arabella should go by Arab, not Bella.|`|N8DgVu9Aaa	all cool nice names<br>  <br>  but i L-O-V-E<br>  the name<br>  Bailee<br>  <br>  x|`|igvUbqkyaa	I love Riley, but that is it, sorry.|`|8iZU6zd5aa	they are all really cute and unique. not that may people have those names. but yours is the odd ball out. yours is very common|`|a3dce0605880850b6c3ecf557a2f663faa	I'm sorry, but the only decent name in there is Ash.

ASH6fsmoaa	I got a Maclaren Twin Techno when my second was born and my first was 15 months old. You can lie the seat flat so the baby can lie down and there's a foot cover which basically makes a little bed for them, totally protected from the elements and prying eyes/fingers with the hood up. The hoods are separate for each seat. It worked for me, but you can't put a car seat on it so it depends if you will want that option.|`|Tj5WkS6haa	I really liked the graco duo glider.

vue9NOhYaa	If you've been trying for 6 years, you're about 5 years past the time when you should have spoken to a doctor.  Odds are high that there is medical problem (either you or your partner) and will need a full evaluation and appropriate treatment.<br>  <br>  EDIT Your gyn can't possibly know that all is well without doing  a complete evaluation.  Sounds like  you need to see a specialist who will take you seriously. "It isn't meant to be" is not a medical diagnosis.|`|wom2ER4Baa	I htink you have to consult doctor..they will guide you properly|`|L9Yzg5IWaa	If you've been trying every month for 6 years then you need to see another doctor.  Has the doctor done any tests (blood work, ultrasounds) on you?  <br>  <br>  Are you sure he's still fertile?  Just because he had one kid doesn't mean everything is still in order.  I'd have him looked at by a doctor too.<br>  <br>  Is he ejaculating inside your vagina?  I hate to be blunt, but I've heard of people who thought they were having intercourse and the man was actually only ejaculating near the vagina and not inside it.  <br>  <br>  Find another obgyn in a different practice.

uFrqC4Y2aa	If you are 9 weeks you would have a positive result. Also at 9 weeks you should have seen a doctor by now.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Take a test. It's not common at all for women to not get positives if they are pregnant. Not common at all. Of course if you think you are pregnant and want to know then go see a doctor.|`|8RfmosODaa	Take one and if it says negative and still no period you need to see your obgyn!|`|A8k9NHigaa	if you take a home test, take it in the morning as soon as you get up, it should be more accurate. If it is negative, are you having any other pg symptoms? If, you need to go to see a doctor.|`|bMvAmMTaaa	if you take one it will tell you positive or negative, go to the doctors to ensure the test is taken properly.|`|R46f2nn9aa	Just do it, what could it hurt|`|2B6F5Zhtaa	I don't think that is true, and after 9 weeks, a test should defineatly show up results if you are pregnant. Worst coems to worst, book yourself in for a scan at your local surgery. They can check for you, and they are obliged to keep everything confidential, so noone has to be the wiser. :)|`|hlWdFTcjaa	The best thing to do is take a test! So then you can decided what you want to do if you are. Even if you are scared about what the result will be you need to know sooner rather than later. Good luck hun!|`|VLRZT9Foaa	You need to go to the doctor, who would certainly be able to tell if you are pregnant or not.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|nhm0tKyHaa	just take a tes....its better to know...and yhen u can make a proper decision bout what u want to do rather then leave it till its to late...<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|eYzuxqQaaa	take the test and if your still not sure then go see a doctor, thats what theyre there for. best of luck to ya|`|d3jtRA8caa	Take one, there are times where you'll get a false negative.

Good Luck!!!|`|rUC7WHLVaa	take one and do it fast..if you are get to the Dr. you should have already seen a Dr. by now!|`|NZid2d1Paa	Yeah i definitely take one now, if you think you are around 9 weeks, it should show up. I took one on the day i missed and the day after and it didnt show up, i waited a least 4 days after and it did show up, but it was faint, but I was pregnant, so take one and good luck.|`|Tj5WkS6haa	Take a test.  Whether its positive or not get a blood test done at your doctors office as well to confirm.  Prenatal care is very important and if you may be 9 weeks you should be having your first appt.|`|OvwQZ7Hraa	Go to your nearest planned parenthood. They give free tests usually and they are done in a lab, so you know that they would be very accurate compared to a store purchased test.
uFrqC4Y2aa	Just because you had a dream you're pregnant doesn't mean that you are. Good luck!|`|RV3oeESvaa	yes couple days back i had a dream that i took a pregnancy test<br>  but the funny thing was that on the test it said i was having a boy. ok so i took the test and saw that i was having a boy i started crying thinking that im to young(18yrs) dont want to disappoint my parents and that i haven't finished with college. so i went to the store and bought me another test it showed up i wasn't pregnant,.. well that was my dream because i woke up after knowing that i wasnt pregnant.lol<br>  <br>  <br>  and also i got my period on Feb 4 and on the 11th i was spotting so i was scared because that happened to me in '08 and i was pregnant. so right now im waiting for my period(i was supposed to get it today) and hoping that my dream wasnt a signed!|`|5RvTXdmUaa	Nope, can't say that I have. Not to be mean, and I know babies are "cute" But they also cost a lot of money and need to be taken care of. It isn't easy. Not that Im saying single parents can't do it because I was a single mother at 18. But you shouldn't want it on purpose at that age. You should get a good education, save money, etc before you have any babies.|`|tZ1XPd1paa	Before I took a test, my sister's pregnant friend had a dream I was pregnant. A few days later, I had a dream I gave birth to a little boy. A few days after that I got my positive :]. Well now I'm 20 weeks 3 days pregnant and I find out what I'm having tuesday lol. I really think its a boy. Well I hope u get the result your looking for good luck!|`|wUMrDRe8aa	I had the same.<br>  Probably the BEST dream I ever had. <br>  It's not necessarily saying you are pregnant, but there could be a slight chance if you are getting other symptoms.<br>  Hope this helps,<br>  Lisa.Rr x|`|dRo89MsYaa	I actually had a dream that I was pregnant two weeks before I found out I was. Sometimes it's just wishful thinking and other times it turns out to be true. Either way it goes, I wish you luck :)
Tj5WkS6haa	She will be fine.  Just make sure any medicines she is using is safe for the baby.  It wouldn't hurt to mention at her next OB appt that she was sick,  that could account for her not gaining weight.  Also make sure she is drinking plenty of gatorade and water to stay hydrated.|`|8RfmosODaa	You should let her obgyn know that she has the flu. I know that you have to be careful about having a fever when pregnant so you need to monitor that.
rNvXWMOMaa	sounds like her kids need a good spanking|`|hKJIDdVqaa	well, the child had to learn it from somewhere.  Siblings do argue and scuffle. However it is not normal for a child to go to school and hit etc.  The child is a bully and it better get rectified quickly.  Some schools have zero tolerance for bullying.|`|IRFbj0G9aa	This is pretty hard to answer cause there are alot of variables we don't know:  For example is the child suffering from a condition like a previous answerer asked?  Is the child acting out because his mother doesn't follow through with whatever corrective measure she has tried?  Is the child reacting perhaps to some situation you are aware or unaware of? I could go on forever cause as you must know because you are a mother it is never so simple.  Something I live by with my kids is consistency.  I always follow through, meaning they get a warning, they are told what the consequence will be and I always make sure it is something that first and foremost,  I can follow through on, and I always, and cannot stress enough the word always follow through if they do the deed.  However on the flip side, I do alot of praising, making sure they feel good about themselves, and like the following through on their punishments I also follow through on my promises for the good stuff.  Don't know if this has helped at all, I sympathize with your friend's situation.  Good luck.|`|NQcHRUbfaa	It sounds like it's not just at school,but everywhere they go.  Either he needs more discipline or you try asking the school for suggestions. Hitting is a sign of ADHD,but you don't say if this has already been ruled out. If nothing is working I would call the pediatrican.Spanking is not going to be the answer to this problem. And if you just keep letting it go the 4yo is going to think it's ok too. He's going to get harder to get under control as he gets older. If it's ADHD, the medicine combined with routine and sticking to schedule helps so much. I've got 2 boys with severe ADHD both diagnosed at 4yo[they are 5 and 11 now] and the medicine does help.My 5 yo still acts out and hits but it is getting better. He is not on medicine yet.  Call the doctor!
g9TxgMlwaa	Depending on the state you live in it could be months or years on the waiting list. I had to wait 6 months and I got preference (moved up closer on the waiting list) because I had a job over a year. You and your boyfriend need to get a job quickly. Do what you can for now. I know jobs are scarce at the moment but take what you can and find a cheap small apartment to live in while your on the waiting list for section 8.|`|AA10226047	Call Section 8 and get the address.  You are going to have to go down there and pick up the forms.  Once you fill them out, they will decide if you qualify for section 8 and if you do, you will go on a waiting list.  It depends on what state but the waiting list are usually from 2 years to 4 years long.  You can also go see if you qualify for any other assistance.  For example:  WIC, food stamps etc.|`|ZNhP3mpUaa	you have to contact your case worker. there is probably a long waiting list.
NZid2d1Paa	well I know my mother had a tilted cervix and she had 3 kids and no complications at all. We were all a couple years apart, and my sister had one also, and she has a 2yr old and a baby on the way.

Every woman's body produces a different amount of HcG there for you can not base how far along you are by the amount in urine. The only way to tell is by your last period or an ultrasound. SO if you are 13 and you are pregnant fess up to your mom tell her you had sex, telling her now is better than her noticing your growing belly and baggy clothes. If you're not really pregnant get a life and stop asking fake questions.|`|B6IEHw9aaa	Ok, First things first, YES, There is a pregnancy test that shows how far along you are.but it's not always right its called, 'Clear Blue' or something.

Plus, to tell your mum sit her down when she is in a calm mood and just say 'I'm going to tell you straight, okay, First of, Tell her your sorry, and Then just Say ' I'm pregnant' Maybe have a friend over when you tell her, it makes it more comfortable for you.

49d798aae69c40cbf0926ebc21291224aa	They are all crazy!!!<br>  <br>  There is nothing wrong with a double-barrelled name but why give all your kids the same first name?  I don't mind Mary-Ella or Mary-Etta (although if you pronounced that one fast, I assume most people would think it was Marietta) but they are too similar to be used in the same family.  Mary-Kimmy and Mary-Queenie just plain don't work.<br>  <br>  With the other lot, Lila-Rose Katherine Verity Joy are all nice names but what kid needs that many names?  They'd never use them because they'd never fit onto any forms.  The other two in that family don't work because none of the names match - they're a blend of trendy, traditional and crazy and none of them work together.<br>  <br>  Feel free to break the family trend and give your kids normal names!|`|9tMT4SQUaa	YOU aren't doomed.

I don't like all kids having first names which are the same even when hyphenated w/another.  Also, the other cousin who named her kids with 5 names is not helping them at all.

FjCnMJZPaa	It is a phase don't worry. I have a 3 year old so I have gone through that and he does very little whining anymore, he can now explain things to me better. I think it is so hard for them to get you to understand what they want, so then they rarely get it and it just leaves them really frustrated. Maybe get some books on communicating with your baby or look it up on the internet... Or perhaps your child might be in pain, from teething or something else?... but I am sure it is just a phase.|`|zlGb9NkZaa	don't give in to whatever he's whining about--make him at least try to talk. it's likely he's getting frustrated with his lack of communication so try to guess what he wants if he can't seem to say it.|`|1enIWBGnaa	Just a phase, however, to 'nip it in the bud', DEMAND he speak plainly and clearly for what he wants or he doesn't get i!  I had to do this with my youngest because his older sister was always speaking for him - it nearly drove me crazy until I demanded he speak plainly and clearly for what he wanted.|`|vCq3dR40aa	a couple of ideas. <br>  1.  When you are going to grand his wish, use counting to help him wait for it.  ex, 1, 2, wait for it, wait for it 3.  Here it is.<br>  <br>  2.  Teach him sign language so he can express himself better as he continues to learn to talk.  An advantage is that you might be able to understand more of what he is trying to say because he both signs it and says it at the same time.<br>  <br>  3.  Plus what everyone else is saying.|`|pfisYml0aa	it should just be a phaze that he is going through. what worked well for my svhildren (3) is helping them to talk....that is having my child point to what it is that she wanted, and then having her say the words for what she wants, correcting her. It should help, also tell him that isnt the way to get what he wants.|`|MUVdG9n1aa	When he whines get down to his level, look him in the eyes and firmly say "Quit whining. Please use words. What would you like to tell me?" Most kids whine when they feel they are not being listened to or getting enough attention. Listen to his response and then praise him for speaking without whining. Hope this helps
v5AOyYIGaa	i was on depo for 6months i came off  didn't have any other contraceptive as i was trying to conceive. i didn't have a period for 13 months after the last shot! then i had two misscarriages which broke my heart. so i would say be careful on depo.<br>  yaz my sister is on to regulate her periods and it works brilliantly for her as she had really irregular periods this worked for her.<br>  but as you said every woman is different|`|af2136bcacd19dc5b2bab9b0737163c9aa	NOOO!!! I was on the depo also and then took yaz and omg it screwed me up sooo bad it took months to get my cycle back to normal and just in dec it seemed to regulate and this past month (feb) i had a double period AGAIN! it sucks i've been trying to conceive since sept and got my last shot last may started yaz in June till the end of July and it's messed my cycle up sooo much I wish i would have never taken birthcontrol after i conceived my first baby, good luck hun!
rNsCkHEwaa	The fern test should have shown that your membranes had ruptured.  With my first baby, I had the same rush of fluid that I could not control when I went to use the restroom that you described.   My fern test showed that there was amniotic fluid present, even though the hospital staff could feel the bag as if it were intact.  The nurse said it was likely a high, partial tear.  <br>  <br>  Try to rest and conserve your energy because I think you will be returning to the hospital very soon.    Count your movements and contact the doctor if they stop.|`|ITu6gONdaa	I had the same thing happen to me last Tuesday...not sure what it was but they sure thought i was crazy...im still not sure|`|9QVjNaIPaa	i would have thought it was my water breaking as well. did anyone actually do an internal exam to see where you are at or monitor you for contractions? thats what i would be concerned with.|`|rdpZrBc9aa	Here she comes!|`|C1blHL9vaa	I say go back and keep going back until you feel comfortable. My sack rupture or "sprang a leak" so to speak. It was leaking for days but they kept sending me home telling me it wasn't that. The last time I went they found that there was no fluid inside (during ultrasound) and that my son's heartbeat was slowing down with each contraction. I ended up having an emergency c-section with in an hour. In one of the many times that I had went a nurse had said to me, after the intern left the room, to come back as many times as I need to. That I know my body better then anyone else and to listen to what it was trying to tell me. Don't let them have you thinking you are nuts!!|`|OuuYoSBeaa	if they tested you and it come back negative, then its really a matter of listening to what they are telling you. its possible you had an uncontroled bladder leak? Did the fluid run clear and have no smell...that would be amniotic fluid. Did the doctors do an ultrasound to see how much fluid you had left or still had?<br>  When my sac started leaking it was gushes that did not stop and it took a 5 second examination to tell me that it ruptured, but not fully.<br>  If the contractions are consistant, and getting more painfull to the point you can breath throught them or walk through them, then its time to go back to the hospital.|`|9f659dc664e9c92a14b677cd0b1a2e5baa	same thing happened to me but at the hospital they tried to say it didnt rupture i knew different though then like 15 mins the doctor checked it and it did the nurse tried to say i probably just pee'd liar! get checked agian!!|`|4ZbJhWuxaa	i don't know what a fern test is but i'm guessing its the test where they use a strip to detect fluids if thats it then no it didn't rupture it would have showed up.. good luck|`|fb8e2cf250a0e7a8ad6b9e89534114d1aa	My water broke the same way with a huge gush into the toliet and contractions never started.

vEv2YwWdaa	It means you are an idiot for having unprotected sex.  You probably have an STD.|`|rdpZrBc9aa	Take a test!|`|0694105119befee4909a716cdc301d75aa	CMF having unprotected sex is, most of the times, synonym of an almost certain pregnancy. You are right to be worried, for the pregnancy and for the bleeding. It can be related or not, and you need to check both aspects, asap. For YOUR health.
dAsrWr3Maa	You gotta remember you have two in there.  When I was pregnant with my twins they were all over the place.  High, low, to the right, to the left!  At first when they moved it did feel like gas bubbles (lightly said lol).  The bigger they get the better you'll be able to determine.  Its a cramped up place in there, you will have boxing matches in your belly until you deliver.  Remember to lotion your belly every chance you get and keep your skin hydrated.  It still has a lot of stretching to do.  The more hydrated it is the easier it will stretch and less stretch marks.<br>  <br>  P.S.- DONT SCRATCH UR BELLY!!!!|`|0wTzlG2haa	It is probably one of the babies. When I was pregnant with my twins I felt movement all over the place. If there was only one baby the movements might more likely be lower down but since there is two their placement can be significantly different.

FLpMShKNaa	Totally normal, my sons were just like this. Don't be surprised if he changes soon and then goes to having these types of BMs once every few days.|`|Z8Ui1ugLaa	Sounds okay, breastfed babies do have nasty smelly poops that are light in color.  The seedy poop does go away and it will get a little thicker but not much.|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	Sounds totally normal!<br>  <br>  If it starts turning brown, green or you see blood or mucus in it, it can also mean she has a cow's milk protein allergy. My daughter had this - and while sometimes green poop is a sign of less hindmilk, in our case it was the sign of an allergy. Once I eliminated dairy from my diet, she was totally fine and eventually grew out of it.<br>  <br>  ETA: My ped told me 10 minutes per side is usually sufficient to empty the breast.|`|wiAVa1H5aa	As long as it's orange or yellow you're golden (ha ha ha uh....), if it were green it would mean she wasn't getting enough hindmilk.   Green poop signifies bile being excreted and leaving the body instead of assisting in the absorption of fats in milk, which indicates not enough fatty milk - hindmilk.|`|LhV8D2Xeaa	That is the poop thickening. But if baby is older than 5 months they need baby foods. if your having latch issues go to a lactation consultant before your nipples get sucked off. lol i know owwwiiiieeee|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	In general babies that are making poop are getting enough fat and calories.<br>  <br>  And in general babies getting "too much foremilk" will have bright green poop from the excess lactose, though they will have "diarrhea" -so its obvious that a baby can poop a lot and not get "enough" hindmil.<br>  <br>  From my experience orangy poop is usually related to diet, mom's or babies.  And not in a harmful way, just like food dye can make an adult's poop change colour with no ill effects.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://mother-2-mother.com/normal.htm#NormalStools" rel="nofollow">http://mother-2-mother.com/normal.htm#No...</a><br>  It is normal for the stools of the breastfed baby to be mostly liquid, with small curds that resemble cottage cheese (some say it resembles runny egg yolks). It has very little odor. Usually the baby will have a bowel movement each time he/she nurses. It may or may not sound "explosive". These liquid stools are not diarrhea. Diarrhea in the breastfed baby is rare. A baby who has diarrhea would have stools that are very frequent, usually green and full of mucus (and/or specks of blood), and almost always foul smelling.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.drjaygordon.com/development/pediatricks/poop.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.drjaygordon.com/development/p...</a><br>  In summary, stools in breastfeeding babies are predictably green, brown, yellow or orange.  It is runny and has curds almost every time.  It changes color with viruses, may have a small amount of blood (call your doc) and may come once a day and even taper off to once a week or more after a few weeks of age.  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.squidoo.com/babypoop" rel="nofollow">http://www.squidoo.com/babypoop</a><br>  Tarry black poop, your baby's first poop, is called meconium. You'll never see it again once it passes.<br>  <br>  Mustard poop is common for breastfed babies. Supposedly breastfed babies make sweeter smelling poop. I don't know about you, but I've yet to meet a poop I'd call sweet.<br>  <br>  Green poop is normal in the realm of baby poop. "Green", "poop", and "normal" all in one sentence. It's so surreal.<br>  <br>  Orange poop is also par for the course. I don't know if it's a par 3 or par 4. It's definitely not a birdie.<br>  <br>  Yellow poop - hello yellow! (It's late, I'm tired, and I'm running out of cutesy ideas.) Yellow is normal.<br>  <br>  Multiple color and color-changing poop - as long as the colors are listed above (sans meconium reference), there's nothing to worry about. Baby poop changes colors on a frighteningly regular basis.<br>  <br>  Chalky white poop could indicate that there is no bile from the liver to digest food. Call the doc.<br>  <br>  Tarry black poop, when NOT the first poop, could mean there is blood in the digestive tract. Call the doc.<br>  <br>  Bright red blood in poop means blood has been expressed very close to the anus (i.e. no time to turn black.) Call the doc.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  ----------<br>  Poop colour chart (not kidding) from the Child Liver Disease Foundation:<br>  <a href="http://www.childliverdisease.org/uploaded/File/CLDF%20Stool%20Chart%20Bookmark.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.childliverdisease.org/uploade...</a><br>  (If that link doesn't work use this one: <a href="http://ncane.com/q2h" rel="nofollow">http://ncane.com/q2h</a> )<br>  <br>  -------------<br>  <a href="http://www.llli.org//llleaderweb/LV/LVDec97Jan98p123.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.llli.org//llleaderweb/LV/LVDe...</a><br>  However, the opposite can easily occur. Since feeding practices, ineffective sucking or other problems may diminish the mother's milk supply or prevent the baby from receiving an adequate portion of hindmilk, it is possible for a baby to be adequately hydrated yet have an inadequate calorie intake. Frequent urination remains one valid indicator of adequate newborn hydration from foremilk intake. Multiple daily stooling is an indicator of adequate newborn calorie intake from hindmilk. Both factors are needed to fully assess neonatal breastfeeding.<br>  <br>  Since a lack of daily stooling may be associated with inadequate newborn calorie intake, it is also a predictor of poor infant weight gain. Early detection of this symptom can be crucial for the baby's health and the continuation of breastfeeding. In severe cases, an infant's low calorie intake may lead to weaker sucking, diminished milk supply and critical dehydration. While less serious conditions may be improved at various stages of breastfeeding, it is much more effective to establish a generous milk supply and hearty weight gain in the early weeks than to have to work to achieve them in later months.<br>  Stooling Patterns<br>  <br>  There are many benefits to discussing normal stool patterns with each new mother. When a fully breastfed newborn baby is having several yellow or tan, seedy stools each day, Leaders can emphasize this is a reassuring sign that breastfeeding is off to a good start. What a wonderfully observable proof allaying a new mother's fear of inadequate milk supply!|`|cRoIhjNzaa	Everything is ok .  My daughter is a month old and I was worried about the same thing.  Fact is that breast milk is the best milk for your child because it does have the right vitamins in it. Just not Vitamin D which very essential, so you may have to give your baby multi- vitamin drops.  But if you're worried about her not getting the right supplements from the breast milk eat better.  Drink alot of water, juice, fruits, still take your prenatal vitamins as the vitamins are necessary for the baby.  try to avoid or reduce any consumption of caffeine, spicy food etc.  Hope this helps..|`|4dXI8kuVaa	I don't think you should worry.
9104bb285d8b87b92fe87a09510fdbfdaa	I used castor oil with one of mine and although it wasnt too bad I have been told that it can cause baby to release meconium, and it give your little one a chance at breathing problems once born if it does happen! <br>  maybe you should wait it out a little and then try it closer to 40 weeks!<br>  remember baby will come when s/he is ready!!|`|OuuYoSBeaa	its not a good idea. if you are uncomfortable and crabby now, it will be 10 times worse if you try that option. Just take walks and rest and try sex if you want to help out. No matter what you do, it is only going to help if baby is ready to come so you are best to just let it happen naturally.|`|vcxdTXbraa	I did castor oil three times and still went a week and a half overdue and ended up being induced. It may or may not work. It taste like s***. Just hang in there|`|mzeEo7wraa	well it won't harm you or the baby so why not...my mom gave us castor oil for everything lol|`|OGCohFyNaa	I don't have any personal experience with castor oil, but from what I've heard and read I don't think it's a great idea. The way I understand it is that the oil can stimulate your bowels, which often times can cause cramps and/or contractions, but it doesn't do anything as far as effacement or cervix dilation is concerned. So, basically it could make you start contracting too early - which is basically your uterus squeezing your baby for no good reason, as s/he has no place to go until you're effaced and dilated. <br>  I know it's uncomfortable and I know it sucks. But you're already having contractions - so there's no need to try to induce contractions by taking castor oil. If I were you and having contractions like that, I would call my doctor and ask him/her if there was something I could do, or if I would just be forced to sit it out. There are plenty of other safer home-induction techniques you could try.<br>  Best of luck to you, and congrats on the upcoming bundle of joy!|`|AA11089301	6th? geeeez you need a new hobby....hehe j/k  <br>  you and hubby should go out to eat mexican.....go to the mall and walk  a couple miles.....then go home and have sex....if that doesn't work you'll just have to wait :)|`|KY6tgDa4aa	I would try sex over caster oil. Caster oil will make YOU sick too, and it is NOT good being in labor for hours, and feeling like you want to uke the whole time!!!|`|hAXJ47iAaa	Ugh, I did this with my 3rd child and all it did was make me throw up and uh...have backdoor issues! lol<br>  I would just wait and see what happens...try nipple stimulation|`|Fh4B88ZGaa	No. All it does is give you diarrhea, which will only make you more crabby and uncomfortable. Let your body do its job naturally.|`|yB5go5wbaa	nooooo, it'll just make you stuck on the toilet while you're huge, uncomfortable, and really really crabby. diarrhea doesn't sound fun at 39 weeks.  if you want to try to naturally induce your labor, try walking.  in my opinion, it doesn't work (i tried everything because I went 2 weeks overdue), but it helps get the baby in a good position for labor.  yours will come when he's ready.
b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	Well, I would try a trial of labor and see what happens, then go with a section if need be. You might do just fine ... and it's your third - your pelvis is already 'proven' so to speak. If your doctor felt it was that dangerous, especially given your history, he probably wouldn't even give you an option. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoulder_dystocia" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoulder_dy...</a><br>  <br>  It's sad that you really can't find any research on it that isn't linked to the website of an attorney willing to sue the doctor. How absolutely pathetic. <br>  <br>  The second link might be TMI for you as it's geared more towards doctors, but takes a 'don't panic' approach, which might make you feel better. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0CYD/is_19_34/ai_57006550" rel="nofollow">http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0...</a><br>  <br>  The wiki link has info on it and different positions you can try if doctors think you are heading in that direction again, such as the Gaskin Maneuver (getting on all fours and doing a cat stretch to widen the pelvis). <br>  <br>  I would take a wait and see approach .. things might work out differently, and you usually have some time before things get too hairy - if you have access to an OR immediately in your hospital you should be fine. Ask your doctor, but don't feel selfish for wanting a vaginal birth when a c-section could be avoided ... it's nothing to take lightly, that's for sure. <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|WWfL5tMvaa	I know some women right now schedule their C section just cause they don't want to hurt them selves so take it easy and do what is best for the baby which i guess would be the C section<br>  wish you the best of luck|`|UEAzzroAaa	Well, a sono can tell how big the baby is ROUGHLY. If you have a tiny baby, try vaginally if you want to. But personally i would go for a c-section.<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT: Mouse said it better. I like her answer.|`|LY2LSzPJaa	I would do a c-section just to be on the safe side.|`|PLgNsOF9aa	I would go for C section. If you have a chance of injuring your baby during delivery, why would you chance it?|`|fyTBaGLEaa	I would suggest the c-section.  You've already taken a chance twice with your first two and besides with the c-section the only negative I can think of right now not knowing you rhealth history is the scarring.  I really wouldn't want to take that chance again with the vaginal delivery knowing the possible outcome.|`|cteS3vjJaa	I would go with the c-section just to take one risk factor out of the equation.|`|KNX2sKr7aa	If it were me, I'd have the C-section.  Since you've already had 2 babies with shoulder dystocia, the odds are increased that your next one will be in the same boat.  Shoulder dystocia is extremely dangerous.  It's one of those things that doctors live in fear of.  There is a serious risk of death or permanent brain damage to the baby if the doctors aren't able to "free" her in time.  It sounds like you've been lucky so far and there is no way of knowing if this baby will have shoulder dystocia or not.  I guess your decision depends on how much of a gambling girl you are.  Good luck.|`|0wTzlG2haa	Does this condition cause potential harm to you or to the baby? I would want to find out how likely it is that this problem will occur again. I'd also want to find out what they can and will do in the delivery room if you opt for a vaginal birth and this problem presents itself. <br>  <br>  Beyond that, if your insurance will pay for the C-section and you are willing to deal with the additional complications and recovery time that are a part of a C-section; I was say go with that option. Particularly if having a vaginal delivery might cause harm to the baby.
2ibfQbLcaa	You should not say ANYTHING because that would make you a rude friend. It would be one thing ios she was beating her kid and you had something to say. letting him stay up late may not be the greatest but it isnt gonna injure him or anything like that LOL.. Please, If you are already a parent you should know its not up to other people to raise a child. its up to the PARENT. So let her parent how she wants its her kid!!  Dont worry yourself with it.. Tell her that sleep is great for them look up some healthy sleeping articles. but if he goes to bed that late and waked up at 8 hes getting the right amount of sleep, I would be pissed if someone tried to tell me i was wrong about something so dumb.. sorry.|`|hKJIDdVqaa	my kids go to bed at 8:30- 9:00 on school nights. Occasionally if they have a late basketball practice it is 9:30pm.  I do not care when they go to be on weekends, as I never have problems getting them to go to bed at their bedtime during the week.  As for 11:30pm on a school night it would NEVER happen.  Our schedule works for us, my 10 year old is high honor smartest student in his grade.|`|Z8Ui1ugLaa	Well what's the story?  Occasionally, every night, school the next day, no school.  I personally don't think my son could stay up that late on a school night even if I asked him to.  The latest on school nights is 9pm and that's when he's already started prep for bed at 8:30pm.  Weekends, he's stays up a little later around 10pm but I don't wake him in the morning so early.  I think the latest he has stayed up was midnight on New Year's Eve.  <br>  <br>  My friend's son stays up late like that every weekend and goes to bed late during the week while he has school, but who am I to tell them my opinion.  Good Luck|`|rSWX0CZ7aa	Does she let him/her do this on school nights, or just on the weekends?  If it's only on weekends, I guess it's not that bad IF the kid sleeps in pretty late.  But that's way too late for a school night.  Kids that age should be in bed by about 8:30 or 9 pm on school nights.  If they don't get enough sleep it can really affect their mood and how well they function during the day.  They will be more likely to not be able to concentrate in school and might start getting poor grades.  If you notice that her child seems grumpy and/or tired, you might just want to mention it to her.  But it's her child so you can't really tell her what to do.|`|7d84621e89c49bcba037226d3361c90baa	It's not healthy for her child to stay up that late.<br>  <br>  Even getting just one hour less than recommended per night can set a child's cognitive abilities back years.  Their brains are growing, and sleep is a very important part of brain health.<br>  <br>  The amount of sleep a child gets affects academic performance and emotional stability, as well as things that people have previously assumed to be entirely unrelated, such as obesity epidemic and the rise of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. A few scientists believe that a shortage of sleep during childhood can cause permanent changes in a child’s brain structure. It’s even possible that many of the hallmark characteristics of being a tweener and teen—moodiness, depression, and even binge eating—are actually symptoms of chronic sleep deprivation.<br>  <br>  Seven year old children should be getting 10-11 hours of sleep per every 24 hours for optimum health.  He should be going to bed at 7:00-8:00.  Not 11:30.<br>  <a href="http://www.webmd.com/parenting/guide/how-much-sleep-do-children-need?page=5" rel="nofollow">http://www.webmd.com/parenting/guide/how...</a>|`|zgBelCROaa	no way! the child needs to go to sleep He is tired and grumpy and will try to stay awake but is a major strain on him whether he lets it show or not. Children must also learn healthy sleeping habits. Like going to bed early and getting a full 8 hours. In my opinion your friend is neglecting her child and being a poor mother.|`|SEzIkGNiaa	No.  7-12 year olds need 10-11 hours of sleep per day.  I think 8-9 sounds reasonable.<br>  If her child wakes up at 7 every morning for school, thats only 7 1/2 hours of sleep to prepare for a 6 hour day at school!|`|bz5nbn4baa	Well Im 14 and i go to bed at 10 on school night and half 10 on weekends. I go to bed at this time cause if i have lack of sleep i will probally end up waking up with a headache or feeling sickly! lol x But i think that is too late because a child at that age needs a lot of sleep as they are younger and are more active. My brothers at 7 and 9 go to bed at 9 usually at the latest and my brother who is 13 goes to bed at same time as me but my sister goes to bed 8-half past x   I hope this helps!|`|547Ln6rNaa	I let my six year old stay up as late as he wants on occasion in the school holidays.  I don't think 11:30 every night is a great idea, but nothing bad is going to happen if she lets her stay up sometimes. Didn't we all keep them up past midnight on New Years Eve?<br>  <br>  When I briefly lived in Italy, in the south, they often expect their children to stay up with the adults, it's not unusual for little children of two and three to still be running around outside on summer nights at 11pm.|`|irLnPW4aaa	Well the answer is: it depends.  It depends on what time the child needs to get up in the morning.   If the child goes to bed at 11:30 PM and needs to get up at 6AM, it is obvious that he will not have adequate rest.   However, if the child doesn't need to get up until 9:30, then there shouldn't be too much of a problem.  At that age, about 10 hours is probably right, but again, this varies by individual, some kids seem fine with less sleep, others seem to need more.<br>  <br>  Really, there is no reason for you to be telling your friend when her child should be going to bed.  If it works for the parent and the child, then it is none of your business.<br>  <br>  Personally, we homeschool our kids.  DH and I are both night owls, and so are our children.  My husband routinely works until about 8PM and our children don't get to  see him much until then.  So we all tend to stay up quite late, but we also (except for DH) sleep late in the morning.  My kids go to bed around 11, but they sleep until about 10am.  They are well rested, and it works for us, so I don't care what anybody else thinks.|`|1enIWBGnaa	Allowing a child to tell you what to do is plain and simply WRONG!!!<br>  A 'school aged' child MUST be in bed no later than 9 pm.  If a parent allows a later time - then it's the parents fault!|`|5CtCgbENaa	Here's your answer...<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.babycenter.com/0_how-much-sleep-does-your-child-need_64915.bc" rel="nofollow">http://www.babycenter.com/0_how-much-sle...</a>|`|LCHnUuS6aa	Yes, she should let her daughter stay up until 11.30, because we all have different parenting styles and it's none of my (or your) business.|`|sB5dyaczaa	No. That's way too late. A 7 year old needs their sleep.|`|etHC9ajHaa	because its crazy.... kids get very tired and grumpy if not enough sleep|`|axOJ2XUIaa	No, when they are very young they need their sleep.  They only grow when they are sleeping, for one thing. Your brain sorts your daily experiences when you are in REM time when you are asleep.  This child should be in bed by 8 pm, no later.  You were right.  (I'm surprised the child can function at all).|`|jUlsH8Myaa	No!!  Children need atleast 8 hours of sleep each night.  They are constantly growing and maturing, their bodies need that precious time to rest!  If they go to bed at 11:30 they will not have enough time to get the rest they need by the time it is time to get ready for school.|`|ZTbcCAn5aa	no your friend shouldnt let her 7 yr old child go to bed till 11:30pm....because she aint nothing but 7 yr old...she needs her sleep|`|yJ7X3oEdaa	What time does the child need to wake up? Usually 7 year olds need at least 10 hours of sleep!
9580a1e44dd3d2bae7d2f867611ab353aa	? Yes.|`|kDvKc3npaa	Yes you can.<br>  The hymen is just a little piece of skin that semi-covers the vaginal opening.<br>  It is possible to have sex without breaking the hymen, therefore it is possible to get pregnant without breaking it.|`|1thzSbS8aa	You can absolutely get pregnant with an intact hymen. It's not a barrier of any kind, and it's certainly not birth control. A hymen will not protect you from disease or pregnancy.<br>  <br>  Some women don't lose their hymens completely until they give birth.|`|Fm7z09Kwaa	Yes there are cases in which the hymen is too elastic and it doesn't brake at the time of the penetration.|`|d7kGopYxaa	yes/ Even if his Dck was just a tiny bit in your vagina if the sperm leaks u could get pregnant
LCHnUuS6aa	It's a possibility with partial penetration and sperm in the vagina.  They are good little swimmers given the right conditions.|`|wiAVa1H5aa	That's how Mary, Christ's mom, got pregnant.|`|4e67Pdfvaa	well... I hate to be vulgar but i am sure, there are some pretty small guys out there! LOL|`|kT7GVOosaa	I don't really know how but I am sure it would be possible. very unlikely tho.|`|mLbydsVIaa	yep..i dont remember mine breaking and im 29 wks preggo|`|Sofk2yO8aa	yes i think so|`|Tp795k5taa	You don't always know when your hymen breaks, for some women(girls) it breaks before the first time they ever have sex! But yes, you can. If he didn't penetrate you deep enough to break it but ejaculated inside you they can still swim to your eggs.|`|u1lcZZYfaa	Uh...I really don't know. Like the first person said it depends on the situation. How do you know it wasn't broken? women don't always bleed the first time they have sex.|`|Heyz3xp9aa	I think this could happen if they get pregnant through a way other than intercourse|`|s05BJFkbaa	yes, it's also been biologically proven|`|BcdbR6iSaa	Maybe, it depends on the situation. <br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|ndO6MiQaaa	no
WPI0Z47saa	Yeah it was damaged. You shouldn't have ANY lines before you use it. The windows will start off blank. I wouldn't use it or trust the results.|`|NWv9hOFYaa	maybe somene used it and returned it if you saw a hole in the foil!|`|Y2WMKpHjaa	it sounds like a bad test ! since there was already a hole in the wrapper and a negative its a bad test . <br>  <br>  go get another one and test with that one ! <br>  <br>  best of luck and baby dust to you !|`|syrh8J6Vaa	I would get a new one.  If there was already a line there then it is definitely not reliable and must be faulty.|`|9QVjNaIPaa	it should have been clear so if it wasnt then it was faulty and you cant rely on it to give you an accurate result. buy another one.|`|af2136bcacd19dc5b2bab9b0737163c9aa	Yeah it was damaged hun take another one. I suggest clear blue that's been accurate for me good luck!|`|wnQRhfczaa	The website peeonastick.com has several examples of tests like this and they were all +/- blue dye tests. The site recommends using different tests - have a look on it, I found it really useful.<br>  <br>  If you have the money I would recommend using a digital test.|`|sUBFp1oIaa	Just to be sure you should get another test and retest, sounds like you maybe had a screwy one that either was tampered with or faulty.|`|wom2ER4Baa	i think it is damaged get new one and try it|`|M3xE3V2Baa	Ive never had one like that...so I would say to take a different test.
aac7c6d4d79683e9cae0fe6a541bbccdaa	Most parents have an ultimate goal of wanting the best for their child, so a normal, loving parent will do everything in their power to love, nurture, and teach that child.<br>  <br>  In addition, a parent knows that child better than anyone else-his or her strengths and weaknesses, likes and dislikes, and little quirks.  That intimate information makes it easier for the parent to teach the child in a way that will best benefit him or her.<br>  <br>  We teach our children to walk, talk and a lot of other really difficult things without a "professional" doing it for us.  <br>  <br>  I chose to keep teaching my children myself, and they are homeschooled.  The same reasons I listed above are the reasons that I am my children's best teacher.  I may not know everything, but in that situation I would find a resource that could help my child.|`|1enIWBGnaa	Until a child begins school - the parent is the only educator for a child; walking, talking, etc.  A parent knows their own child better than anyone else; behavior, etc.<br>  Once a child begins school - the parent must still be involved in their child's education until that same child reaches adulthood and moves out on his/her own.|`|oZV7ukGqaa	That is a question that I think all parents ask? We want to be the best teacher possible for our children. So if your asking what makes a parent the best teacher for their own child, or even how to be the best teacher for their own child, I think the answers are similar. For me, it makes since that naturally the parent is the best teacher for our children. We know them the best, we know what makes them happy sad or motivated. We know when they are having a bad day and just making excuses to not do the work or they just plain don't like the work. To be the best teacher for your child, we must teach by example and never expect them to do something that we would not do ourselves, example (when we say you must always keep your desk area neat, we must then teach them by always keeping our work area neat). We must listen, encourage explain and then have the patience to explain a second, third or even a fourth time. We must be gentle with our expectations and at the same time firm. Above all we must practice unconditional love and reward them for all of their efforts.
gzaVGE4Qaa	Low birth weight is the least of your worries with exposure to narcotic pain medications. The baby can get brain damage (I have an ex-friend who shot heroin through her pregnancy and the baby is just over a year now and has serioius emotional, social, and mental problems - he is in a foster home now, thank God).

bmoCpcdraa	sounds old fashion, dear|`|TCpPdqcBaa	I like Ella better. When I think of the name Ella, I always picture a sweet, kind, generous girl.<br>  <br>  It is such a sweet name.|`|Ya1zZORIaa	Ella is a gorgeous name. It sounds like a gorgeous girl with long wavy hair who would have the sweetest personality in the world. She would probably be a perfectionist in school and go to med school or something.<br>  <br>  I have never met anyone named Aili. But it looks like it would be pronounced ale-ee. The "ail" part makes it look like it would be pronounced that way because many people pronounce words that way with that combination: sail, bail, fraile, jail, etc. Maybe you could change the spelling to Isleigh, Islee, Isley, Isli. I personally like Isleigh the best. Everyone knows that "isl" makes the "eye" sound: island, isle, Isla Fisher lol.|`|igvUbqkyaa	Aili - always dying her hair different colors, pretty face but very different looking, long/thin legs, chubby upper-body, very nice, an activist<br>  Ella - red hair, fair skin, flawless skin, freckles, average size but not athletic, not very personable, a bit snobby, very wealthy, rarely smiles, smart|`|tboBarP7aa	Ella would be a good choice.<br>  I always associate ella with this delicate sweet little girl.<br>  I was actually thinking of naming my baby ella as well :)
ENANtueuaa	Yes, that's normal. The reason she lost the weight is because she grew so fast. My daughter is also 5, and just had a huge growth spurt. I bought her size 5 jeans at Christmas time, and she's already outgrown them! I swear i can't keep up sometimes lol but, she's always been on the tall side, and thin.|`|Oq2B7I4faa	Yes it is.  My daughter had her 4 year checkup yesterday and she grew 2 inches in 4 months.|`|IybV1Enwaa	Normal. Just make sure she is eating well and sleeping enough. When kids grow fast these two things matter a lot.

You dont want a baby unless your married. and see where that conversation takes you
nVSuER8Paa	Sit him down and have a chat with him. Spend more time with him also.<br>  <br>  he may get jealous due to the age difference and you may be paying more attention to your 4 year old without realizing it.<br>  <br>  Just take some time out from your day and spend time with him, don't push him to open up, because he will shut you out.<br>  <br>  Or you could give him a journal or something, that he can write anything he wants in it.  When that journal is full, he can either bury it in the yard or burn it.<br>  <br>  Jking about the burning part.<br>  <br>  Or if you see him look angry or something, have him do some free writing.<br>  Give him some paper and tell him to write whatever comes to his mind, wether good or bad. Tell him to write how he feels, than ball up the paper and burn it in the sink.<br>  <br>  This was recommended to me, when I got angry. I wrote what I felt and burned the paper afterwards (parents watching me burn it)<br>  <br>  I felt a lot better, plus my parents started to spend more time with me, and balanced the time out between me and my sister.<br>  <br>  <br>  Rotate the weekends, one weekend take your 12 year old out wherever he wants to go (that is reasonable) and take him, you will be surprised that he may just start opening up to you|`|N6cuuDAmaa	It's not that big of a deal... It can't cause much damage to his brother since he is 4, and he's just getting older and could be starting to go through puberty, that could be it... just tell him that he needs to stop doing that and if you find him doing that again that he'll be grounded from tv or video games or his cell phone (if he has one) for a week... that should help... and don't worry... you didn't do anything wrong!|`|T864ejaiaa	my 12 year old daughter slaps on my 9 year old. she says you love baby girl more. it's called sibling rivalry. if it happens again, pray that it don't. just have him see a counselor.|`|l00Lo2zDaa	Sounds to me that your 12 yr may have anger issues or something of that sort. Try to sit down and have a reasonable talk to him about abuse and the effects it has on children, not just shaking baby syndrome but mental affects from child abuse, not to mention the physical abuse. There is no telling what the extent is when you aren't home and you don't know what is going on. Also try to have a talk the best you can with the 4yr old to find out exactly what is going on.|`|e1ae2fbad2e2e19da95432269bb0ccd0aa	My 12 year old daughter is normally a great sister as well.  We have her, and two boys, 3 and 1; however, there are times when she gets so frustrated with them that she ends up being mean.  I have never seen her physically abuse them but there are times I worry about that.  We have just started her on counseling.  Since she has only gone one time, we don't see anything change but the counselor told us that her reaction to the younger siblings isn't uncommon.  I recommend doing the same for you son.|`|5veU5nSwaa	Well a 4 year old isn't exactly an infant but I agree with giving him the literature, personally I would get him into counseling, clearly there is an issue, maybe it is small and won't take long to resolve.|`|AA11785285	Hard not to wish to slap him silly, isn't it?<br>  <br>  Time rather for you and he to have the big talk about abuse.|`|d5479b73829d5fa0818d9eec2850a058aa	You haven't failed him, he's 12 years old and he knows right from wrong.  Remove his priveliges for a couple of weeks and give him plenty of housework, gardening and cleaning the cars.  See if he has the energy to be shaking anybody then.|`|iCexBHclaa	take him to a counselor.<br>  tell him that what he did was wrong and<br>  if he EVER does something like that again <br>  everything will be taken from him. <br>  toys, tv, friends everything <br>  after that i don't think he will do something <br>  like that anymore.|`|TcAqU8XXaa	have a talk with him, hes going threw that time (puberty), and 12-14 year old get really short tempered, give him the talk. Your probably a great parent.|`|zRQmWC5saa	u need to never leave ur 4 year old with him alone again. and also u need to sit him down and really have a long talk with him and the lil 4 yr old. tell the 4 year old , if brother is being mean to u to holler!|`|nLsd1MUYaa	Talk to him about it! Tell him if he does it again that he will be grounded from something for a week! You haven't done anything wrong, he's probably just going through puberty or something!
xWyXbsw6aa	you should be fine, its your body's way of letting you know your not pregnant, plan b throws your body out of its 'normal' cycle and will prob be out of whack for a couple of months before its returns to a more stable routine, <br>  <br>  plan b has worked for you - if you are still worried, please take a pregnancy test - just to clear your mind :)|`|jqueOakiaa	Yes its normal. I took it and about 4 days later i had the same thing happen to me. Its normal and it will probably throw your cycle off for a couple of months.
0wTzlG2haa	My godson (who is now 18) also has hydrocephalus. He was diagnosed almost immediately after birth. They were able to give him some medicine that helped some, but it didn't go away. When he was almost two they made the decision to put a shunt in. Yes, there is the potential for problems but I can tell you that my godson has had very few problems. He has had to have a shunt revision...but that happened two years ago. After he had his original shunt for about 14 years. I can also tell you that while he was doing "okay" developmentally before the shunt his development skyrocketed after the shunt began to take effect. He has other developmental issues but after the shunt he learned to walk, to talk and numerous other things that they didn't think he would ever be able to do. This is due in large part to his parents and how invovled they have always been in his development and learning. <br>  <br>  My best advice, share all of your concerns and fears with the neoursurgeon and/or with your neurologist if you have one. Ask for some honest answers to your questions. Also ask if the neurosurgeon has any parents who have been through this who would be willing to share their experiences, positive and negative, with you and your husband.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|HXfHkoSHaa	I would be worried as well.  It's only normal to feel this way.  Is there any way to see the degree of severity on the ultrasound?  Maybe this can help in your decision making.  I wish the best for your family.|`|WrUTuQdlaa	Rarely if ever goes away on it's own.<br>  The cases in ultrasound diagnosis were not confirmed, just suspect.<br>  Sorry, wish there were an alternate way.<br>  Best of chances.

However doing so just to gain in your finances is what is wrong with people today. Having a child is a deep and wonderful gift and to do so without the love is ungrateful. Just think for a minute of all those women out there that can't have children and do nothing more but pray and cry for one. And now think about what you want to do. Please PLEASE think long and hard about this for a minute, do you really want to bring a child into that kind of environment? The only one hurting in the end would be that baby. Please think about your decision.|`|L9Yzg5IWaa	I don't understand your question.  Are you trying to be funny?<br>  <br>  You can only get pregnant if you have a womb.  If you were born a guy and get a sex change you won't be able to carry a baby because your internal parts will still be male.  You'll just look female.<br>  <br>  I have no idea what you mean by getting money.  I'm pregnant and have a kid and I'm not getting any money.|`|b99kfMPcaa	I would go through sex education before thinking any further...  it seems like you have no flippin' idea of what you're talking about... troll|`|dlOFWcU4aa	Yes.  That is exactly what you should do!|`|URbMCRFLaa	If you are a male to be changed to female, you still won't be able to carry a child because you will only have a surgically made v a g i n a and c l i t o r i s. You would need the rest to do it and as far as I know, doctors can't do that. I think you may be talking about doing it to become a paid surrogate, but unfortunately this is not an option for you even with a sex change. There are better ways to make money in these hard times! Good luck with everything!
KmC0K59taa	I never had my baby's but peel.  We use Bordeux's Butt Paste.  Might be spelled wrong.  Lots of people swear by it.<br>  <br>  I would let her go without her diaper for a few mins and let the area get some air.  That will help it.|`|ENANtueuaa	Are you sure it's a diaper rash? It could be a yeast infection. My daughter's bottom has never peeled like that. You should try Aquaphor, by Eucerin...you can find it in the baby isle. It works wonders on diaper rash. Within hours you'll already see improvement. It's more like vasoline, not the zinc oxide type. If it doesn't work, you should take her to the doctor and make sure it's not a yeast infection. Hope this helps!|`|9ptIuJ8uaa	I think the skin is peeling because it is dead skin cells. If it is healing then she may have some peeling. It is ok. Don't wipe her with a baby wipe until it is completely heeled or you will set her butt on fire! Wipe her off with a warm damp washcloth and make sure the area dries completely before you put her ointment on. If it is not dry the ointment will hold the moisture in and it could make it worse. Put her in cloth diapers while awake and let the area breathe. It may be inconvenient for you but it will get better quicker and you don't have to deal with her being mad.|`|WOHc22Xiaa	I always use a&d ointment so I dont know but it kinda sounds like it wasnt a diaper rash. It could have been a yeast infection and diaper rash cream usually makes it worse. Try taking the baby to the doctor just incase.

It is nice to be able to discuss our children with people who are sincere (I know I am at least). There is no better advice then that from someone who has been there. I hope I am talking to real parents not some weird hacker who is PRETENDING to give a S@#!|`|cAtWxJG1aa	heavens, who has time for another parenting board?<br>  <br>  actually i do read two local boards for my town, one relating to preschools and one relating to issues facing elementary and older kids.  those boards and this one are pretty much night and day.  the parents on the local boards are a heck of a lot more polite (on average ... there are polite people here, too, but you have to look for them), and also a lot more liberal.<br>  <br>  there's something to be said for time spent with a totally different crowd, though.  toughens the skin, opens the eyes.....|`|s4LWmcTjaa	This is pretty much the only parenting board I've visited (other than Cafe Mom).  I have to say I enjoy this board much more.  I know it will sound stupid, but I do have friends and acquaintances on this board that I am very fond of.  <br>  <br>  So I suppose I could answer you question as no given my own experiences, but then I again I don't visit any other parenting board.  Good question though.

Dilating is the opening of the cervix and effacement is the thinning of the cervix.  So you might be 2 cm dilated and 50% effaced which means the cervix is open 2 cm and thinned half way.  When you are 10 cm dilated and 100% effaced then you are ready to deliver the baby.|`|xc8bnpCvaa	when the cervix thins in preparation for opening for childbirth|`|njgHAiBiaa	It comes from the French verb "effacer" which means "to erase".|`|X6as2nOAaa	I don't know thinning of something I believe.|`|bIvsLrCUaa	the thinning of the cervix.

T864ejaiaa	well, my 12 year old was hanging out with 2 other girls in school. they stole 2 cell phones and makeup. my child had to go to court, pay $145. and went to alternative school for 4 months this was in nov. this monday she went back to regular school. when i got the call i had to go get her. she was crying. i told her in front of the officer and principle she was grounded for a year. i don't care what anyone has to say about the year. she is my kid. i have to raise her. she will obey the law and me until she leaves my home. she goes to school, comes home. does her home work. she can't leave the house except for dr's visit, school and if the house catches on fire. i have taken nothing away from her. it did not help before. so i grounded her for the year. that hurt the most. right now it seems to be working. sometimes we have to turn love into tough love.|`|iCexBHclaa	once i got in trouble for calling my<br>  german teacher a B*tch and the <br>  school called my parents and when<br>  i walked in they were sitting on the <br>  couch with the "look" then they talked<br>  for like an hour and i just sat there and <br>  had to listen.|`|6xmIPYimaa	ask them what happened. give them a chance for their side of the story to be heard :)|`|AA11210211	It depends on what the bad thing was.
427abcdfcd8e012fe37537ef1426e40faa	I don't know that it's ever appropriate to purposely hold off just for the sake of teaching the child a lesson.  Yes, there are times that you can't respond immediately -- you're going to the bathroom, tending to another child, getting something hot out of the oven, etc.  However, you do the best you can.  <br>  <br>  The nature of the cry also makes a difference.  No matter how old the child is, you should always respond to a hurt or scared cry.  A little fuss or a frustrated whine, though, probably doesn't require immediate attention.<br>  <br>  I figure that there are plenty of naturally-occurring events that will give my children opportunities to learn patience (and there have been).  There's no need to start waiting a few seconds or minutes to respond to a cry.  <br>  <br>  Children will grow up, and they will become independent if you allow them to.  They do not need to be forced into it.  <br>  <br>  For what it's worth, I have responded regularly to my children's needs throughout their lives.  My 5-year-old happily trotted off to preschool at age 3, and she's now happily in kindergarten.  She handles herself very well and can even fix her own breakfast (Eggo waffle or cereal) without my help.  My 4-year-old is right behind her, and even my 18-month-old will happily stay with trusted family/friends without needing me to constantly be by his side.<br>  <br>  Children always need your love -- hugs, kisses, and reassurance that all is well.|`|df805281ce1bc1c7c3de30c04dbcb458aa	When there newborn etc I think it's a mothers instinct to react quite quickly. I  think in a matter of weeks you have obviously both built a strong bond. <br>  What you do not want:<br>  My sister in law has a 7 month old, she phones my brother and he is in my car. She says can you hurry home now..I need to go to the toilet! <br>  I said to my brother 'why do you need to be there for her to go to the toilet?'<br>  Answer: because he will cry when she leaves the room!<br>  Unbelievable to say the least!<br>  Thats the extreme in my eyes. You have to live too and cannot be there every minute of the day..so try and teach them patience and give them lots of love too.
IGwX328eaa	You in no way are a bad mother. Just tell your MIL the symptoms or colic then see if she has anything to say it doesn't sound like your daughter has colic these are the symptoms:<br>  <br>  Your baby may have colic if he or she cries excessively over several days. Although this crying can occur at any time, it usually gets worse in the late afternoon and evening. Colic usually appears in the first few weeks after birth and the cause isn't known. It generally lasts for three to four months.<br>  <br>  Although colic isn't thought to be due to pain, your baby may look uncomfortable or appear to be in pain. Babies may lift their head, draw their legs up to their tummy, become red in the face and pass wind. Colic is not a serious condition. Research shows that babies with colic continue to eat and gain weight normally, despite the crying.|`|7bdhpvc9aa	Ughhh...The "in laws" sure know how to put there two cents in everything don't they. If your baby had colic then you would definitely know. Nobody knows your baby like you do. My MIL used to tell me the same thing but that was only because my son would cry everytime she held him. I would immediately pick him up from her and he would smile. :) Sounds to me like you are a great mommy and you want the best for your child. If you ever think something is wrong with your child then it takes a quick phone call to the doctor to clear things up. Good Luck & God Bless|`|vvB0Etysaa	Hi:<br>  <br>  My daughter had colic.  Trust me you will know.<br>  The baby cries all the time even when it is full.<br>  <br>  The doctor would be able to tell you if she did by asking you certain questions.  Make sure you burp the baby sometimes babies need more than one burp.|`|w4zjmhxoaa	Then she doesn't have colic! <br>  <br>  Colicky babies are terribly fussy and will cry for hours at a time.  Yours sounds wonderful =)|`|mbshLuFfaa	I think your M-i-L and s-i-l are just jealous.A colicky baby cries a lot and scrunches up their faces,and has wind.Just tell your in-laws to 'butt out'.|`|9ro8fiKvaa	Yeah, your baby doesn't have colic. If she did she would be crying as if she were on fire for 24 hours a day. I had colic as a baby and my mom told me that it was so bad that she put me in the garage becuase she was going insane with my crying - the Dr had told my mom that there wasn't an awful lot that could be done - I was a 70's baby! Good luck and remember that only you know your baby better than the Dr knows her. Your mom and your sister only know about their own experiences! Good luck!|`|zHy0z7sAaa	Do not worry what other people are telling you about your child.They are not professionals and most people tend to think because they have had a child or know someone who has a child, they are experts on the topic.My daughter had colic and it was constant, no matter how well fed she is, how dry we kept her, how much we held her.If your baby had colic, very little that you did would be able to soothe her.And even if it was colic, which i highly doubt, how exactly does that make you a bad mother?Nothing you could ever do would be a reason behind colic.I'd explain to my MIL precisely what colic was and remind her that babies do cry, sometimes for no good reason.Hope this helps.I'm sure you are doing a great job!|`|20c96a5e1e1d8742c7835d3700704d38aa	From what I understand of colic its when the baby pretty much cries constantly. Your In laws sound a little paranoid! Next time you take her to the Doctor ask them but it sounds like you have a perfectly happy bay and they might just be trying to make you feel like a bad Mom. Shame on them and good luck.|`|OF7ZHq19aa	Fussy and whiny|`|bf6fb0f4caadf24cfa826edc2cc32d3baa	Constant Screaming|`|A7w2Zg95aa	i dont why they are telling you that naybe there are some other sighns go and get a check up from the doctor to make shur|`|AA10186411	If a baby has colic, trust me, you know!  She would be crying constantly, and have bad gas.  If she isn't fussy and rarely cries, then she does NOT have colic.  Tell them to shut the hell up, because they obviously don't know what colic is.

gJ2vPKqsaa	Are you breast feeding?  I know if you are then it can take a while for your period to regulate, possibly even until you wean.  But if you're not I'm not sure.  The pregnancy symptoms could be from ovulation.  I haven't had a period yet since giving birth (8 1/2 months ago), but I've had pregnancy-like symptoms for the past 2 weeks but I'm not pregnant and am assuming that I ovulated and should get my period soon.  I've heard that can happen from someone I know.|`|L9Yzg5IWaa	Are you breastfeeding?  A lot of women don't get their periods until after they wean their babies.  I've even had friends who didn't get their period until months after they weaned their babies.|`|URbMCRFLaa	I don't know how much 14 kilos is in pounds but from my experience... I gained 55 lbs when I was pregnant and my first two periods after birth were a little "off". I did have a c-section so it could be different if you didn't since they usually suction out a lot after c-sections and vaginal births bleed it all out (after birth and beyond). Gaining a lot of weight can change your periods, as can stress and poor nutrition. BUT, the things you are feeling now sound like pregnancy symptoms. If you were sexually active without protection in the past 2-3 weeks, you should go buy a cheap preg test at Dollar General or the Dollar Tree and see if it says positive. Buy a few for your medicine cabinet and if it's negative, wait a week and try again. The great thing about the dollar preg tests is that they do work (I've confirmed 3 pregs with them) and you can buy a few and not feel so bad testing too soon when you're anxiously waiting to test. Good luck!|`|f7lWwZeAaa	If ur doc says no go get a second opinion if u feel sumthin wrong, but I honestly don't think u r but good luck!

Putting more expensive things on there doesn't mean anyone is obligated to purchase them for you. It's just saying "Hey, I need this too." A lot of people may go in as a group and buy one big ticket item. After all a registry is just a wish list.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	I think it depends on who your audience is.  If you know you have people in your circle who are either intending to buy you a large gift, or go in on a large one as a group, then I don't think it's tacky.  I would be conservative though.  I didn't put furniture on my registry, but I did put a few "big ticket items" - pack n play, swing, etc. because I knew that some friends and family members would be looking to buy something substantial.

Maybe you come across that way to him, and to him you aren't even married yet...perhaps he just wants to focus on the wedding...or maybe he's just as frustrated and that was his way of saying something. <br>  True, he could have said something different or nothing at all...but you shouldn't be putting him down on the internet to ALL these people you don't know.<br>  <br>  If he is insensitive to other people, then you knew that, and you know that going into this engagment...so you can't really expect him to be sensitive to you.<br>  If you don't like it, then you need to leave it at the door BEFORE you get married and have kids.|`|KWJ7ju6qaa	Very insensitive; but lets face it, guys don't always think with their brains.|`|537fb036f0d7f523891b1281ae7d57d1aa	I agree it was really mean for him to say.<br>  <br>  I disagree with anyone staying with anyone who treats people (ones they even love) that way.   <br>  <br>  Do you want the father of your future children saying mean things to them?<br>  <br>  You should change your question to "my ex-fiance is a jerk?"
CIZjK2rAaa	As hard as it is, I think you should wait.  If AF doesn't show in a few more days, go for that blood test.|`|ioTPGLRwaa	i too am 16dpo and two bfn today!!!!but my af isnt due until 19dpo.........good luck just know you are not alone|`|yPNvecc7aa	I would wait. The spotting is probably your period coming on. Best to be sure you really missed it before going through the trouble of booking an appointment.<br>  <br>  Good luck!
dY5fM2vTaa	well i know you can have periods all throughout pregnancy my mom did with my brother. I would take a test or go see/ call your dr to ask questions|`|sgMnPDpUaa	If you are getting ur period, then u r probably not pregnant (sorry, I know ur trying). The change in pattern in ur period might be due to stress, change in eating habits, weight changes or anything really. Once, I got my period twice in 1 month! Chances are that u are not. take a pregnancy test and keep trying. Goo d luck!!|`|7RH1WmWOaa	Yes, I've had it a week early and a week late..if it continues to come a week early then you might want to get your hormone levels checked.|`|qdP5WAMgaa	i think that you are paranoid
bmoCpcdraa	don't care for it ,,,|`|nAOlBmzDaa	um, no|`|igvUbqkyaa	I think people will look at it quickly and think it says Conrad but I guess it is okay. It is more of a word in my mind as in a friend.  I personally wouldn't use it, but it isn't terrible.|`|9EdUCTwjaa	how about Conrad ?|`|pCbzhOrkaa	I think its cute!|`|SS87lbOCaa	i dont like it|`|ecNeN0staa	Well, now that Obama is president and we live in the USSA, it's only fitting that you call a child Comrade.|`|gseSpMCGaa	I definitely wouldn't choose it. If you like "Comrade" why not just use Conrad, it sounds pretty much the same, and it's actually a name.|`|9PfEKygaaa	if you are russian, and you want to call your son "friend"<br>  sure<br>  <br>  but might as well just call him "friend"<br>  <br>  but most people won't like it... its a nickname for calling someone a communist|`|006ed0be5fe4d5038edb0687a8ef5597aa	Well, I know that Conrad use to be popular, so I think Comrade is a good name and has a great meaning to it.|`|QmFfeSslaa	I think Comrade is cute! Although, nicknames for Comrade are kind of hard to find/make.|`|6b3TGvJ5aa	No.|`|Lm7LCpK9aa	nice name for a dog.|`|i3FgiLENaa	It's not Russia, we're not communist... So my answer is no. That's something that means friend, it's not a name.. Sorry|`|R08owgUtaa	i wouldn't name a baby Comrade. it sounds too much like the word comrade, as in friend. i don't think that babies should be named after words. if you want a similar name, try connor or conrad.|`|c8f8978bfae705ec30c276472d60b840aa	Hell yah best name ever <3<br>  <br>  ;)
DRb4Qlypaa	She probably would not told you anything if she wasn't certain. They may just want you to come back so they can get a good measurement of the spine.|`|QSodlfMraa	the farther in you are, and if you do the 3D or 4D it can be pretty accurate.|`|zRQmWC5saa	I think they all would be accurate. as long as the nurse sees what she sees. but a few times she has been wrong and it turn out to be the other. I had ultra sound done all 4 times and never once was wrong.|`|16f786290d793ae0cfafb186615cca8daa	Even with the 3D, I know a couple people who were told the wrong gender. It's pretty rare they're wrong nowadays, though.|`|wqbZbwpBaa	I'm not sure the exact stats, but after 20 weeks it's usually accurate. However, if they say boy it's almost always accurate. But if they say girl, there is a chance his genitalia (if it's a boy) hasn't formed yet and it could be hard to distinguish.<br>  <br>  edit : My brothers are 3 and they're triplets. We were told 2 boys 1 girl, but in the end they were all boys ;) As long as they're healthy, it's okay.
UDENYO4raa	My initial one was heartburn... Everyone will sit here and tell you that it's not possible to get heartburn that early, blah, blah, blah, but I swear! It was the KEY sign that I knew!|`|L9Yzg5IWaa	Nope. Sorry.|`|9a3sNrEqaa	i just thought I was getting my period!!! it was strange!!!!! GOOD LUCK HUN!!!!!!!!!!! TONS OF BABY DUST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|l3OWdPo5aa	no.sorry.|`|URbMCRFLaa	With my son, starting from a few days before I missed my period throughout almost my whole pregnancy all I wanted was milk. I never really liked ice cream before that and by my second trimester I fell in love with ice cream. It was weird for me :-)|`|WdvLcYaVaa	I remember being soooo tired even before I knew I was pregnant I would just about fall asleep standing up. I know that isn't a strange one, but I didn't know I was pregnant (we weren't really trying) so I just thought I was getting sick or something.|`|BeNazR8Jaa	lots of GAS
KWJ7ju6qaa	Just an odd answer, but maybe she thinks the gum is still stuck.  Next bowel movement, try making a fuss about how the gum came out and try to stick a chewed up piece in it.  Sounds gross, but kids have some wild imaginations.  <br>  <br>  Other than that, i would ask the doctor.|`|72SrLDQ3aa	Definitely talk to her doctor.|`|Al4U0Im7aa	Sounds like she thinks the gum is the hard poo. I would give her foods high in fiber to help soften her stool. If she strains too hard or has blood in her stool take her to the doctor. She could develop an anal fissure or hemorrhoids. If she cries when she poops, take her to the doctor. But I would just try food high in fiber first. Yogurt is great.|`|AA11327039	She probably means she needs to poop and she doesn't like how it feels coming out.<br>  <br>  Add Benefiber for Children to everything she eats and drinks.  Talk to your pediatrician about dosing.<br>  <br>  I have an almost 2 year old and he gets about 2 teaspoons a day.  One in the morning with breakfast and one with lunch.|`|9ptIuJ8uaa	Take her to her doctor. Try giving her some fiber to help regulate her. She shouldn't have to deal with pain when having a bm she's still little.
3e60b4b8a21cff4d800cdaf2499a3366aa	If you and Dad are going with them (which i would assume you are with that many little ones!) then i would go as Snow White (you) and the 7 dwarfs (Dad being one of the dwarfs).  Doc, Bashful, Happy, Grumpy, Dopey, Sneezy, and Sleepy are the seven I think, but you might want to double check their names.|`|0Ww9gRkSaa	my friends and i once were this family of ghosts. it was so funny. like the dad carried a briefcase and hat and the little girl had like piggy tails that i got a walmart. and se had like a little ghost dolly. it was great, you could have a dog, a cat, a mom, a dad, a baby, a little girl and boy, a grandpa, whatever you want! <br>  <br>  another thing that you could do was dress them up as different color crayons or something...<br>  <br>  or maybe like all dice and then like your husband or you could be the yahtzee board... haha i have no idea (:|`|xaWEdRNWaa	Wizard of Oz(baby can be Toto), Justice Leauge, Star Wars (baby can be Yoda), Alice and Wonderland, or Flintstones.  Good Luck!|`|S0GSFVswaa	well if you really want to stick with ur M&M idea just make the twins the same color:)<br>  <br>  ((That would be so cute:)ur family sounds nice))|`|f32Drtu0aa	something funny if i were to walk with you and you were snow white and you had seven dwarfs i would lol|`|a34e6b0d3635b089c5a7917078fe691eaa	in my opinion they should all be something different|`|TXddP0uxaa	Your kids are not a "set".  They are each their own individual person.  They are also all old enough (other than the infant of course) to decide what they want to be for halloween themselves.  Let them pick for themselves.
wzXJOSIeaa	From personal experience. YES! I actually got down to a couple pounds lower than my size before I got pregnant. It works and it works FAST. And not to mention how much better it is for your baby.|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	yes, for most anyway. it will help at least. you burn an average of 500 calories a day just sitting on your butt breastfeeding|`|oUtEVKDHaa	I lost a lot of weight i dont know if its because of that. but i do breastfeed|`|Lnt4u4q6aa	Yes, and also when you breastfeed it makes your uterus go back to it's original size sooner, so you also look more normal faster !<br>  Isn't breastfeeding wonderful ?   :)|`|690279cb7caa51056d2e306c73dae94faa	It seems true for me.  I lost all my baby weight due to breastfeeding and I still am losing weight.|`|98WKYtfwaa	Yes, you burn 500 calories extra per day when you breast feed.|`|jjQOvFyzaa	i delivered 8 days ago..ive been breastfeeding but giving a few bottles here and there b/c its soooo demanding but i weighed around 120 pre pregnancy..165 when i was admitted in labor and delivery and today only 8 days later i weigh 136 so i would have to say yes but since this is my only child i dnt know how fast i would of lost it if i wasnt breastfeeding|`|qKnE08Rxaa	Strangely, for me breastfeeding didn't help me to lose weight at all. I worked out a lot before the baby(like 40-50 miles of riding bike & running) & now I don't so much. I think breastfeeding isn't enough caloric burner for someone like me who used to burn so much before.|`|963a60ad2fe21d7cef6dc7185c595623aa	It does help.  Breastfeeding will help your uterus shrink back to its pre-pregnant size.  Plus breastfeeding takes extra calories and women usually eat healthier while breastfeeding.
z6IekuwSaa	She sounds advanced for being nearly a month early! I wouldn't think you have anything to worry about. If you want to help her develop the core muscles to roll over hold her hands and help her sit up that way.|`|mjz8JF9Gaa	if she is sleeping on her back rolling will happen a little later <br>  my sons doctor said that they may need to change the age of rolling over because many babies are doing it later and that is ok because she needs to sleep on her back and as 4 her hands shes probably teething and that's ok to|`|ROJans2Taa	my son is 6 mths and can still only roll from back to front, put him on his tummy he scrunches his knees does a belly flop, lol. he has been grabbing toys for awhile now, but I wouldn't worry, Ive seen my nephews all progress differently and all turn out fine, my daughter seemed to progress a little faster in ways then my son is, she is probably starting to teethe some and wants comfort, my son loves ramming his fists in his mouth as well, best luck|`|rjVALevtaa	Sounds completely normal. Babies (and young children) tend to accelerate in some areas more than others. For example, a baby who is trying very hard to talk may not be as interested in learning to walk.<br>  <br>  Your daughter sounds like a normal 4 month old. Since she was only 3 weeks early she probably won't be far behind other babies if she is at all.|`|Fy9S6hjIaa	I sounds like she's right on schedule, even advanced especially for a premie!  My son didn't roll over well until he was 5 months old.  At this age babies are usually more interested in putting their hands in their moths then they are doing anything else with them!  Its totally normal.  Don't worry!  It sounds like your little angle is doing perfectly fine!|`|8yTP3jO8aa	Sometimes girls develop their finer motor skills earlier than their larger motor skills.  It's not unusual to see girls who can do the really fine stuff but not the big stuff.  Boys are usually opposite.  Even at nearly 2, my little boy is great at big stuff (pushing, pulling, climbing) and his little girl friend is great at fine stuff (opening, twisting, picking).  This is kind of how you end up with 5 year olds where the girls can use scissors well but the boys can't.  So yes, pretty normal.  Plus, if you consider that her adjusted age is just barely over 3 months, she's doing great.<br>  <br>  I'm not so sure what's normal about giving a 4 month old premie (adjusted age just over 3 months) cereal, though, unless she has reflux.|`|FLpMShKNaa	her adjusted age is actually around 3 months, lots of babies don't roll until 6 months or later, 5 months is the "average" for most babies to roll one way. It sounds like she is doing wonderful. I think you have to lok at these things generally-if she wasn't doing any of the things expected for a certain age, then its cause for concern. But if she is able to sit well, get from side to side, and smiles, laughs, interacts, thats great.|`|g9TxgMlwaa	She's only 4 months old honey give her time. She'll reach her milestons when she's ready. Some may come early some may come later. As long as she's interacting then she's okay. Like you said she's getting distracted by toys. Bah.. just let her. My son walked at 10 months and at 2 years and 3 months he's BARELY learning how to say a few words. It's cause for no concern. I promise things will happen when it's time.|`|9FrBtCfDaa	oh honey this is normal. babies like to put things in their mouth. try putting the toy in her hand and when she grabs it I bet I know where it will go- right into the slobber! the mouth is the most sensitive feeler at that stage, the easiest way for her to determine what something is. And that's okay because soon she'll be teething and the best comfort for that is to have something to chew on.|`|oiJITSNZaa	My daughter too is four months old on the 2nd! She doesn't sit up yet by herself. And not doesnt' roll even from tummy to back. Not to mention she doesn't eat anything but milk yet. So if anything yours is ahead of schedule! the recommended age is 6 months for starting anything other than milk because their digestive systems are not developed yet and they have no need for anything but milk. Good Luck!|`|mAJZFmIEaa	my daughter is 4 months ( born 4 weeks early ) she does all those things and more but i was told that i should go by her corrected age and not how old she really is.<br>  your supposed to go by your daughters corrected age aswell so really she is advanced in doing alot of things that she does|`|wP0AjcQ1aa	Sounds like she is doing great! My son wanted to eat his hands at 4 months too and didn't roll over until be was about 5 or 5 1/2 months. He just started crawling at 7 months. <br>  <br>  You are doing great and so is your daughter!! Good job!|`|TvYX1yXWaa	my son is 4 months old and cant sit up or roll over yet. i put him on his stomach and he hates it .. he cant lift his head either.|`|VCCKfT3taa	Oh gosh, mine didn't start rolling over till after 5 months, and at 6 months she's finally mastered it. And yes, as she was learning she would roll to her side, lay there, wriggle and then get frustrated and stop. <br>  To her encourage her we would get on the floor with her and actually physically roll her a few times then act all happy and clap our hands like, "yay we're rolling!!"<br>  <br>  And your baby has hit the "sitting up" milestone before mine did! Mine is 6 months and still doesn't sit up very well for very long. It's going to vary a lot between babies. <br>  <br>  If she still doesn't roll from tummy to back by 6 months you should talk to your doctor. Just keep encouraging her and be patient with her. She's learning!|`|BwXJXeezaa	She is FINE!  She will reach that stuff, sitting up is early at her age by the way.... dont worry give it a few more months my 7 month old rolls around like crazy but that started about about 6 months old|`|zHy0z7sAaa	My daughter is almost 5 months old and like yours was born 3 weeks early.Also like yours she has hit all of the milestones yet she hasn't rolled over yet.She's like your baby in that she gets so frustrated, she starts crying and stops.I was concerned at her 4 month check up and her doctor said it was completely normal.All babies do things at different paces and some skip some of the milestones altogether.She has only recently within the past week started grabbing and swatting at objects.Sounds like your little girl is completely fine to me.
m0DgqEcjaa	If you can have an ECV, i would, although some people say it is painful, it is no where as near painful as a c-section!<br>  <br>  Good luck<br>  <br>  Had an emerg c-section with my first (couldn't do an ECV as my daughter had the cord wrapped around her neck)|`|0UzfNoA2aa	Hi i had to have an ECV done at 37 +6 for breech baby. I found it? rather painfull and was not a success as my baby was to far down in my pelvis. It also set my labour off 3 days later, so i ended up with an emergency section. If you do get the chance to have 1 tho i would def go for it as the healing time after natural birth is not as long as it is with a section. Good luck hope all goes well xx
ATyHswTTaa	she knows if she crys u all come running and give her attention.. if keep that up u will not have any time to do anything.. leave her cry for bit, she has to get used to it.. also try bouncy seat for her, or walker where she sits in, leave her entertain herself for while during the day so can do ur house work etc..|`|wiAVa1H5aa	Hold her up.    My oldest did that, actually he did it as soon as he was born - it was very annoying.   When she can sit up on her own she will be much happier (and so will you), and she won't need to be held so much.   Don't worry, the end of this trauma is near.|`|r52rfBkeaa	My son did this too.  I don't know why, but you couldn't soothe him if you were sitting.  It got better when he could sit on his own, but I would try a baby carrier.  She just wants to see what you see and not miss any of the action.  You can let her cry a bit, but it really won't help any.  It sounds mean, but suck it up and keep standing.  Do squats for your bum or sway to take the edge off your back.  The end is nearing!|`|KHZ0qwqfaa	My daughter did the same thing, and it definitely eased up after she learned to sit up.  Some babies don't like to be held like a "baby" My daughter definitely did not, I could not cradle her unless I was breastfeeding, she has to be on my shoulder or held on my hip over my arm facing forward so that she could see everything.  These are the "ones" that will move fast.  And if you go to any pediatrician they will say a 4 month old can not be spoiled they only know what they want, but if it does become frustrating do let her cry a little.  It is almost over, I suggest you get a Baby Bumbo chair, it helps babies learning to sit up, and she is almost there, that is when my daughter learned to sit up. Then crawling is gonna upset her until she can walk, and then run...After my daughter learned to walk the crying days were over, she is 2 and 1/2 and tells me everything she wants, and if I take too long, she goes and gets it herself...LOL|`|sWWX615gaa	i know this sounds mean but it sounds like the baby is spoilt and please dont pick that up the wrong way i did the exact same with my first he wanted me to be pasing the floor with him all the time when i would put him down he would start screaming but you just need to use tough love and i know that not easy with a small baby just leave the baby cry for a while before picking him/her up like leave the baby cry for 2 mins at the start and as time goes on increase the mins the baby will realise tat you are not going to stand up with them it worked for me.|`|AA11025762	welcome to the battle of wits u have for ever now with ur child lol|`|T0k5GxiLaa	Don't always react to her first cry! At this age children are identifying ways to get your attention. Mainly because they cant speak and tell you what they want. As you have been picking her up when she cries and sitting her up she has learned that she will get your attention that way. All children love attention but too much can be just as bad as too little. You do what you feel is right! You are her mum and as i work with children parents have many different parenting styles each is different in their own way. Do what you feel is best for your child.|`|xDEYAUwGaa	Ya I know its hard but you  need to set her down and let her cry a little.  Dont keep reacting to her first cry, just let her cry and self-soothe a little bit before picking her up.  She is just use to being held and up and walked around, so get her use to having fun on her own.  maybe get a play mat for the ground with toys dangling down that she can play with.|`|v5AOyYIGaa	my son did exactly the same thing i spoke to my health visitor and she said he being nosey lol he wants to no what's going off around him. she told me to put him down sit with him make him feel secure, play with him, it just take time to break a habit that's all.<br>  try putting her in a pushchair and taking her for a walk that always works for me as your out and she can see loads of things.<br>  Good luck xx
z6IekuwSaa	You do not have to get emancipated to claim yourself for the independent status on fasfa. You do have to pay a percentage of the bills and prove it, that means they have to actually be in your name. And with fasfa it is nearly impossible to claim yourself until you are 23. You can get loans without doing this. I got loans that covered my entire college without being independent and didn't have to pay a dime until 6 months after I graduated. The payment is only $42 a month. So don't stress about it.|`|wxEqpMrEaa	Well this is certainly a mouth full. Ok, if you have steady employment and you are old enough, then yeah you can,  you really sound sure you want to do this, but the question stands as to why you want this. You know when your really paying 90% or more, then it is going to cost more than what you described your making. The average rent is around $400 plus utilities i.e. electricity, water, gas... the average cost of one person to live in a month is $700 every month. Are you positive you want to do all that?<br>  <br>  Personally, I think it is a bad idea. It doesn't sound like you need to go away. So, if you do decide to do this, then God be with you. There are no breaks in real life. The bills come every month. So, on top of what you already pay, this extra $700 mo. can be overbearing.|`|Jo8nlGVsaa	I'd say go for it. As long as you have everything laid out, but be aware renting is VERY expensive
URbMCRFLaa	Because your cycle is not regular, it is hard to guess but the spotting you had could have been implantation bleeding. If it was, you would have to wait one to two weeks after for pregnancy hormones to show on a test. At least that's what I've found out from researching the same thing. My periods are regular but I had spotting that sounds very similar to yours about a week before my period. Never got my period and have had very light cramping and feelings in my lower abdominal similar to when I was newly pregnant with my son. If you started spotting around 2/18/09, I think you could take a preg test now. If it says negative, wait and try again in a few days. If still negative, either wait for another period or call your doctor to have a blood test done. Good luck expanding your family!|`|g9TxgMlwaa	Wow.. Your periods are so erratic I don't know what to honestly tell you. That discharge you had on the 18th of Feb could have be the ovulation time. I'm honestly not sure. The HPT you took on March 1st I believe after waiting two days after unprotected sex is definitely too soon. Unfortunately it's more about waiting. But with your periods all over the place. I'm honestly not sure when would be a good time for conception. I'm sorry I know this didn't help at all. But I guess wait a few more weeks if period is not here by 16th of March retake. I know waiting sux. but best you can do for now.|`|L9Yzg5IWaa	I'd wait to test until your period is officially late.  That way you should have plenty of the pregnancy hormones in your urine.  So if your normal period is due around day 33 then I'd take the test then.  <br>  <br>  Also if it's negative this cycle, I'd start buying an ovulation predictor test.  Your period should come 14 days after you ovulate.  This will help you know when to try and when to start testing. (It is the second half of your cycle that stays the same and the 1st half that's less predictable.)<br>  <br>  How long have you been trying?   Did you have irregular periods before your son was born?  Did you go on Depro after your son was born?  My SIL was on Depro and it did really goofy things to her cycle.  She had to go on medicine for a short time to make her ovulate regularly.  Then she got pregnant right away.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!
UuAV4wVNaa	Thats really pretty :]]<br>  <br>  <br>  I mean.. if you say it right.|`|LoP2CRE2aa	I love the name Alora! I think it is beautiful, classy, and unique. It sounds great with Dayanne.|`|cb5c699472c5114ed99da5404a38ca3faa	I like the name, what about Alora Rose?|`|igvUbqkyaa	Yeah, I guess Alora goes with Dayanna but I don't like it.|`|mP6ox5f3aa	Your baby will grow up and will possibly resent her odd name ( it means something like 'now then' Italian) Give your baby a decent name that she can grow up with. A name can be off - putting and somehow not appropriate. There are 2500 names in the Bible!<br>  Give her two.|`|TGUoZF63aa	I like it a lot! It sounds like the name of a princess :)<br>  <br>  also, try:<br>  Alondra<br>  Amelia (Mia)<br>  Lucia<br>  Simone<br>  Jolie<br>  Chessa|`|hkUzSsRZaa	That's a beautiful name.

I wish I had thought of that one! If I have a third girl, I may steal it!!!!!!! And you have a chance for a running theme if you want- Alora Rose sounds very pretty. I picked unique names for my girls as well, and for our second (to be born by c-section on the 20th of this month!) it was a little harder. We wanted unique, but nothing that would be more or less than our first daughter's name. So, we have a Jocelyn Renae and Temperance Isabelle! And, like I said, I may steal Alora! It will fit right in!!!!!|`|5Z4ivxpaaa	I really like the name.  Elora is also an option as Alora sounds like "alluring" might not be what you want... or maybe it is.  I like either one.  Maybe continue with the "flower theme" and name her Alora Rose or Alora Viola or something?|`|AA11876718	I'm so sorry! I also laughed when I saw this!! why??? because I know sanitary pads called alora!! oops! the only place I saw this name was in bathrooms! don't let her friends make fun of her at school when she grows up please!! Laura!!!!! ít's so close to this...ALORA plus it's a normal name!! Dayanna Lily and Laura!! what do you think??|`|6zCm65haaa	unless ya frm the uk u wnt understand wot term ppl use alora in like we will say god me u have 'alora' ants outside lol stuff like that but its entirely up t u wot u call your daughter i like <br>  <br>  eden rose <br>  <br>  ella mae <br>  <br>  ellie mae <br>  <br>  broadie lynn<br>  <br>  janay emmison <br>  <br>  latia grace <br>  <br>  hope i helped  let us no wot u decide plz|`|htfyL6I2aa	I knew an alora and everyone called her laura because the name sounds wierd|`|CTmWS6dMaa	Alora is a beautiful name|`|XaBR0Scyaa	alora new different and nice middle name taylor|`|DwkUUQqhaa	Yes, I love it!<br>  <br>  Congratulations, and have a wonderful day! <3|`|HMPdnhApaa	How about Aurora? Just a suggestion b/c it means "sunrise" and your other daughter's name has "day" in it. :)|`|KNX2sKr7aa	I like Alora.  It's pretty.|`|5Lw7feUkaa	It's nice... but my initial reaction was it reminded me a little of Aloe Vera... but I do like it!|`|f4ba47a2857db6a4c06027dd19f8455aaa	How about "Allura" (pronounced phonetically like Ah-loor-ah), so as to suggest that she was born so "alluring"?  That is a very psychologically reinforcing name that may make her feel more special and desirable as a full-grown woman, too! It is a better associative name than the original "Alora" one you had asked about here because of the similarities of spelling like the word Alluring, both on paper and when properly pronounced orally. Just changing the spelling a little makes it much closer to that word Alluring, which means appealing, desirable, and boldly sensual or sexy, which I believe all women truly want to feel. I read the comments about not giving your child a name that really is too different from the crowd but I disagree. Kids many times feel awkward until they reach adulthood anyway. No matter if you named her Sandy or Jane. My brother's name is Meinrad Joseph XXXXXX (pronounced like "Mine - raad" with a harsh sounding drawn-out short A sound like in the word Radical). He had an equally different nickname as we called him "Meinie" growing up (like "My-Knee"). Yes folks... there really is a Meinie, like in the nursury rhyme that starts with "Eenie, Meenie, Meinie, Moe... " etc.). He really likes to be a unique person with a unique name now as an adult and it is a very powerful sounding and very masculine sounding name, too, which is a great name for a 6 foot 5 inch tall, extra-large boned guy who is a private security policeman with a very commanding presence. As my mom used to say, "Whatever name you give a child seems to really fit and after a short time it becomes so evident that there truly could just be no other perfect name for that child". I trust my dear departed mom's wisdom.|`|bmoCpcdraa	alora rose,,,|`|RAxe7X3xaa	I saw that and I laughed.
hw3OMoeZaa	Sound like my first 6 weeks of pregnancy, take test, why are you waiting, id be peeing on a test ASAP!|`|AA12370001	could mean you have a virus, a UTI (urinary tract infection), IBS, etc.  Take the test and you'll find out.|`|dY5fM2vTaa	you need for sure to get a test seeing how its been past the time for your period to come and yet no period still and its now march. I would get a test and see what it says or get a dr apt|`|2jrffIoWaa	It sure sounds like it.  Take a test!  *fingers crossed!*
9580a1e44dd3d2bae7d2f867611ab353aa	? could be colic, but call the doc to have her checked out... better to be safe than sorry.|`|Fd4lITkvaa	Colic typically starts around 3-4 weeks. It's normal for almost all babies to have a bad night every once in a while and it's not always colic. Unfortunately colic is something you just live through, there are some treatments but they don't always work. You can try gripe water, you can get it at any pharmacy. If you have another bad night try bicycling her legs to get any gas to pass, swaddle her up and take her in the bathroom and run the shower for the noise only. Keep the lights dim and gently bounce with her, even try to give her a pacifier as well. My son liked us to pat his back firmly while bouncing with him, I don't know if it made his stomach feel better but I have heard from other moms with colic babies that said the same.<br>  <br>  My son had colic and this worked for him most of the time although we had our nights where he would cry from 6pm-4am solid. It calmed down around 10wks and was pretty much completely gone at 14wks.|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	yeah.. I agree that it sounds like colic. one things that helps is to hold her with her belly on your forearm and pat her tummy with your hand while rubbing her back with the other hand. Worked for my son!|`|AA10186411	Sounds like colic to me.  Is she breast or formula fed?  If she is formula fed, I suggest changing to Nutramigen.  Its a very good colic formula, and did wonders for my daughter.|`|oXzHvsBpaa	Theres a million reasons as to why she is upset. She could be constipated, she could be gassy, she could have colic, reflux might be an issue. I would talk to your doctor about it. I would also buy a thermometer when you get the chance because that is one item that is very necessary when it comes to a baby.<br>  <br>  As for the eyes rolling in the back of the head and them opening during sleep. Its normal. My son did that all the time. <br>  <br>  My son was upset a lot and it turned out hat he had reflux. As for the constipation is she formulafed or breastfed? If formula fed chances are its the iron in the formula can cause it. We had this problem with our son and ended up having to change him to a Gentlease formula.|`|vvB0Etysaa	Sounds like your baby has colic.<br>  You can surf the web.<br>  If your baby is passing gas its either<br>  a) her milk<br>  2) her food<br>  Try buying the right age bottle nipple. As these comes in different stages.  She might be drinking to fast or to slow which gives her gas.<br>  Make sure you burp after each feedings.  Some babies will want to burp again after 15 -20 after feeding.<br>  Sit her up and rub her back gently this will soothe her.<br>  Also, a good exercise with gas is lie her down on her back.<br>  Get both of her legs and gently pull up and down like as if you were riding a bicycle.  This relieves pressure and lets out gas.|`|oAIxqdfFaa	These are definite signs of COLIC or gas in a stomach. Try giving her GRIPE WATER.|`|lD0VcAlpaa	Could be colic, could be gas. I'd call the pedi for further advice, always call the dr. after an hour of inconsolable crying as a general rule. Good luck.|`|TB8Lrd9Waa	hello i have a baby boy of 4 weeks  now he was born on thr 3/3/09.  i read your story and it was exactly what i was going through. . i took him to the hospital and it turned out to be GASTROENTORTIES.  a bug in there tummy. . his poo was different as well... all the things your baby is doing mine did the same too.. .. .the kicking the legs hard and i could not setteled him at all. . . was nearly crying myself.  . . .

AA11296427	Build a 'fake friend' bridge and quickly get over it, that's all you can do.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  :]|`|wdnbwViFaa	just ditch her. she obviously isn't the same person she used to be.<br>  Good Luck :)|`|1ikl5q97aa	the other girl is right , when you hit high school it would be very weird if you didn't make new friends and let some of the old ones go , me and this girl (my neighbor) have known each other for 12 years and always have been best friend's , when we hit high school i think i've talked to her once . No biggie there are better people to be friends with out there . Juss don't talk to her and hang out with the people you want to hang out with .|`|Mjni0Np3aa	dump her! (i know you're not dating) but if she's going to be rude and fake don't put up with it. you have other friends and so does she. You don't need to keep trying to be nice to her if she's just gonna be a b**** back to you.|`|af2136bcacd19dc5b2bab9b0737163c9aa	Everyone changes when they get to high school hun that's just the sad truth, when i got to high school i made completely new and different friends than the ones i had in middle school and so did my other friends we grew apart and found people that were more like eachother but even with that we never stopped talking. Your friend may just be getting attention now by the way she's acting and she's enjoying it. Just let her go I would say everything happens for a reason you'll find much better friends TRUE friends. it's true what they say you meet your true friends in high school. good luck hun and best of wishes|`|qEfJvQBWaa	well one thing i fell bad for ya = [ because i know how you feel <br>  i have a lot of acquaintances in school too and i only have like about 2 people i can really trust as well<br>  first off in high school thats when everyone changes and finds out who they are or who they're going to become <br>  your friend must be going through A LOT to be acting fake and different she is probably trying to make changes in her life including what friends she has.<br>  A girl acting fake around other people obviously means she is insecure about her self and is trying to be something she really is not<br>  or she is either really jealous and is trying to be like you, or maybe just better than you<br>  I say she is being mean, and shes being the exact opposite of a friend, and honey you need to go and forget about her because she is being rude right now you gave her a chance and now you need to step away and find a REAL new BEST friend who will always be there for you when you aren't going through the best of times
9580a1e44dd3d2bae7d2f867611ab353aa	? Call doc or go to ER, babies that little really need special care when such things happen.|`|8yTP3jO8aa	It's not super dangerous as long as you can keep her reasonably comfortable, keep her hydrated, and keep any potential fever down.<br>  <a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_5284_treat-chicken-pox.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ehow.com/how_5284_treat-chick...</a><br>  <br>  One question and one comment:  did her big sister not get the varicella vaccine?  Just curious.  On an upside, you won't need to even consider getting the varicella vaccine for your baby later, because she'll already have an immunity.|`|AA11635397	WHAT!!!! wow i've never heard of a baby that young getting that. why would you allow her to even be around her big sister knowing she had chicken poxs. i'm not trying to be rude but seriously you need to be more responsible. serously|`|egPRQpYjaa	get to a Emergency Hospital fast it could be life treating! and come on letting your baby be by her older sister that has chicken pox! seriously life is fragile!!!! not only that you wait for an answer on yahoo answers! get to a EMERGENCY HOSPITAL HAS FAST AS POSSIBLE!!!|`|20c96a5e1e1d8742c7835d3700704d38aa	OMG call the Doctor immediately I have never heard of someone getting that at such a young age! That sounds VERY dangerous! Don't let contagious people around your newborn their two little and their systems are too weak to fight off illnesses!!!|`|aiDV9FgGaa	Very serious. Alert doctors immediately. They may want to hospitalize the baby.
oXzHvsBpaa	My son was also born on November 5th. So they are the same age. Yes she should be due for her vaccinations. Did she get any when she was 3 months? I know that my son did.<br>  <br>  Ah. I am from the USA so I guess things are different over there. I know that you do get vaccinations at 2,4,6, then a year.|`|pXSKSS3daa	Yes, she'll get them at 4 months and 6 months then again at a year. This is, of course, if you're following a "normal" vaccine schedule. If you're delaying or spreading out any then it will be different.|`|mjz8JF9Gaa	yes shots usually go <br>  newborn <br>  2 months <br>  4 months <br>  6 months <br>  9 months <br>  1 year <br>  and so on|`|f762b1b79baf609a926675240c6b2e95aa	When my kids were little (they are 10, 7 and 3 now) they had 2,3 and 4 month injections, not sure if this is still the case, each time the local health authority used to send notification through the post.  This may vary depending on your area.  They are only approximate guidelines so you may here something soon, if I were you to be sure I would give the midwife a ring in the morning.|`|heDtLdz5aa	i believe this is how my pediatrcian seen my son and gave him vaccines...2 months...4 months..6 months..he had a 9 month well visit but no shots...12 months 15 months...he will be seen again at 18 months and then 2 years...and then i believe his well visits will only be once a year...|`|Lnt4u4q6aa	WHAT DOES HER PEDIATRICIAN RECOMMEND ?|`|9ro8fiKvaa	Yup - 2, 4, 6, 12 months, 15 months & 18 months. Your best bet is to check with your Dr if in doubt.
fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	You know we have babies in Canada right?<br>  <br>  And we don't spend 10 months of the year inside.|`|oojO4WAraa	That will be fine.  Don't bundle her too much - baby's bodies are pretty efficient.|`|yPNvecc7aa	If it's too cold for you, it's too cold for her.<br>  If you have to cover her face over with the carseat blanket, what's the point of taking her for a walk?<br>  <br>  But if it's nice and you're comfortable in your own skin outside, then I don't see why not.<br>  : )|`|Lnt4u4q6aa	LOL I thought you meant COLD.  It is 15 degrees here today ! <br>  YES, I would take her a for a walk if it is 55.  Dress a baby the same as you dress yourself. Dont overbundle her.<br>  enjoy your walk|`|Ph3sh6Goaa	Take her out.  Today is was 25 degrees, and my daughter and I went walking.  She's used to it!|`|P7VdWn7baa	I would not. BUT...<br>  <br>  Could take her out. But put mittens, beanie, and a warm outfit with blankets. GL|`|9ro8fiKvaa	That's almost 13 degress celcius!!! OF COURSE IT'S OK! My god, we'd have NEVER gone outside had I kept my baby indoors for most of autumn, winter and most of spring time!!! Get outside! I had my daughter outside (bundled of course and with a weather shield on) in -10 C weather!|`|TB8Lrd9Waa	i have a 4 week old baby boy. .he loves being outside. . i say its great for them. .but have to be wrapped up well. .. i find my baby sleeps better at night when had all the fresh air that day,, ,, , , , enjoy your walk. . . . . x|`|2SllTEayaa	As long as you wrap her up warm and make sure she has a hat and gloves/mittens on she will be ok. Keep checking her temperature by feeling her skin and don't go to far, so you can get back home if you need too.|`|9nrJSRNTaa	its too cold.
8NihgPsMaa	if your on work experience you will not be asked to do anything on your own or be left alone with the children. you will not be aloud to change bums ect. just play with the children and ask the adults ther if ther is anything that they would like you to do. ( i work at a nursery 3months-4years and thats what hapens at mine)|`|Ph3sh6Goaa	preschool children?  Well, you'll have to comfortable changing diapers and peed-on clothes, wiping little behinds, wiping noses, etc.  The children will test the limits with you, so you have to be consistent with them.  But, they are a lot of fun to be with!  <br>  <br>  I'm a former preschool teacher
AA12089900	Take a test they're not expensive, obviously it's possible your preg or else you wouldn't be asking.|`|62pCvaXGaa	Take a flippin test.|`|0tslWNw4aa	Congratulations!<br>  <br>  You're pregnant. You should see a doctor though because it sounds like the pregnancy may have attached in your tubes instead of the uterus.|`|rFESfymOaa	take the test!!!
tcHkn0VIaa	How bad is the pain and is it your uterus? your apendix is on the right side so if you are having sharp stabbing pains I would go to the hospital. If it is your uterus it is more than likely round ligament pains ( your uterus stretching).|`|gRZT4pnUaa	Not trying to be funny, but it is probably just trapped gas.|`|46K4FtE0aa	don't worry as long as there is no bleeding, you should be fine, pains in pregnancy are normal, due to the ligaments stretching to make room for the fast growing uterus. just relax and enjoy your pregnancy.
QSybnIU3aa	yeah this is true apparently, i went to use it at my local gym the other day and wasnt allowed (and im pregnant too by the way). something to do with risk to blood pressure or something.|`|rUEBe7yPaa	I was told that as the baby doesn't have their own way of regulating temperature in the womb then , going in extreme heat such as hot tubs  or steam rooms or even really hot baths should be avoided as it can cause the baby to over heat and become distressed , its also causes your own heart to work faster to regulate your own core temp and as your heart is already working extra hard for the baby then you can feel faint or lightheaded.|`|v3LnJycKaa	go ahead, ask your dr, but i have always been told that if you stay cool and hydrated tubs and such are fine, drink abig glass of ice water while in there if you get too hot or uncomfy get out.|`|3kW6i3Vdaa	It's true|`|f762b1b79baf609a926675240c6b2e95aa	I think it's because the heat can raise your blood pressure, your advised to stay away from the steam room, sauna or spa at my gym if your pregnant.|`|AA10693194	they are not recommended when you are pregnant. any extra heat is not recommended|`|gRZT4pnUaa	It is probably true. I was told don't get in a hot tub!|`|BO28Mn8haa	you should not be going into that heat. listen to her.|`|TO2Gh7Rjaa	Ooooops !!!<br>  What am I doing here?<br>  I followed the pace of one of my contacts and what happens?<br>  I've found myself among those beautiful creatures, talking about pregnancy, heat and do know what ...<br>  Sorry ! Make as if I'm not here ... Just watching ...|`|Rcv1c1j1aa	Yes: Pregnant ladies must protect themselves from vicious Doctors who, under the guise of good samaritans, will only mislead you and your pleasures. Do what makes you feel happy. Do not allow your Doctor to abuse you.|`|tcHkn0VIaa	I believe this may be true just because it would raise your core body temperature and keeping your body heat regulated is very important in pregnancy. Good Luck|`|DRb4Qlypaa	You do not want to get overheated. This is not over the top at all. This could hurt the baby. You should NEVER get in a hot tub or a sauna (steam room).|`|sgMnPDpUaa	This is true. My doc said the same thing because a huge change in temperature is even more significant inside of u. this is the same with blood pressure.|`|4XfjUcvDaa	Probably true.  Extreme heat can effect your body and the baby.|`|LjdXApTIaa	yeah its true|`|LBdqqISCaa	not sure.<br>  google it
