QD03bB8Aaa	yes, i do. it will be wise for USA to recognize that china is faster growing,more organized, and potentially as militarily powerful. in fact, an intimidating equal. and the two economies are so complementary that obvious wisdom is for them to mesh for mutual benefit and growth - may be china will gain more than USA but the latter would gain too substantially.

HfsZisOdaa	In any group there are many variables and it would be hard to offer real solutions here. You are dealing with the issues of the meeting, the goals, the personalities, etc. I would suggest perhaps giving some topics out ahead of the meeting to a few of the folks and have them lead the discussion on those topics. For example "Cost Reduction" given to two people to team together on the topic and they can then make some proposals to be considered. <br>  <br>  <br>  ~

Canadians are really chill and like everyone - that's why they're Canadian.<br>  <br>  And why do I have the feeling that you're some villager who is trying to make Canada into THEIR OWN liking? Just because a few people don't like you doesn't mean that all Canadians suddenly hate you. Ever thought it's maybe just your personality?<br>  <br>  I agree 100 per cent in what zdotb is saying, but I'd just like to add one thing: all immigrants are not like that. Just half of them - who think that they're superior and "own" Canadia or shite like that. Who bring their old-time judgments/crap about things here and try to change the way we are.|`|EYbrRrtiaa	It sounds like its the other way around, you hate Canadians.

rpajoT0raa	I sympathise. That sounds really frustrating. When you say they give the job to someone else... who do they give it to? The grassroots bar industry is full of blokes.... you know what I mean.<br>  <br>  Perhaps it's time for you to raise the bar (hehe, 'scuse the pun) and apply to positions with larger and more posh establishments that will recognise your credentials over favouritism. Hey, what about the bar of the Hilton Hotel or Star City Casino? Places like that are constantly concerned about high standards of hygiene and organisation.<br>  <br>  It sounds like you know what you're good at and you know the business from the ground up... now might be the time to get a really flash resume drawn up and start shopping it around to places that you'd never dreamed of approaching before. <br>  <br>  Have the confidence and belief in your abilities and don't be shy. Throw on a nice looking suit and go to those interviews with your head held high. With that kind of experience, you are worth a much better paypacket and you are needed full time! <br>  <br>  Good luck :-)|`|096b7gBHaa	for a high standard of  hygiene and organization, systematic book-record practice, excellent customer service, prevention of  wastage and breakage while keeping a clean and tidy place  plus having trained new staff and helped them to achieve their managers certs- --these are usually the criteria seek by hotels, diners and restaurants. bars aren’t really into those stuffs, as they’re into somebody who’s more expert in handling  brutes and speed, I guess. <br>  <br>  <br>  could be that the reason the job you applied was given to someone else is out of chances; or condition. perhaps the other person has applied earlier, just that you didn’t knew it, or it could be somebody who’s closely related to the owner, whether as friend or relative, or maybe it was somebody who’s in need of a job more than you do (since you aren’t that jobless and desperate at the moment), or maybe the person who got the job was somebody who is more experienced or older, plus some other possible reasons such as personalities.<br>  <br>  if there’s a common reason people are into getting a guy as bar manager (or bar keeper?), it could be coz  guys are believed to be able to handle any upcoming circumstances better,  e.g. fist fights, problematic drunks etc. – although it isn’t that necessary for there can always be other people to handle things such as that. but who knows, if people wanna feel more ensured.  <br>  <br>  but if you really wanna make sure if gender is really the issue here or not, perhaps you'd get more from GWS|`|qL3dGTXDaa	Looks as if it time to ask around for investment money and open your own business.
