20090307102227AALX2hi	Consumer Electronics;Music & Music Players	How do I convert RealPlayer video files so I can use them on Windows Media Player?	I've seen someone else ask this question, but the sites people gave didn't work, or i had to pay for software.       I have used RealPlayer to download some videos for a project, and they've asved as flv files. I need them to be something like a mpeg to work on Media Player, so I was wondering how I can convert them without having to pay for software that I'll never use.

20090307103000AAX4jfd	Consumer Electronics;Games & Gear;Nintendo Wii	Any recommended Wii Action Games...?	For my boyfriend's birthday, I was thinking about buying him a Wii consuelo.  He already has Xbox 360, and I was thinking maybe he'll like Wii.   But if I buy the Wii, I want to buy him some good games he'll be into.   For his Xbox, he liked to play Grand Theft Auto and other games that were alot of zombies, and alot of weapons, and fighting.   Does any one have any recommended games like that for Wii?   And is their a website for gamers so they can blog or something and I'll see what games are in for Wii now?

Well i have AT&T now (formerly cingular) and i am sick and tired of seeing all these "hidden charges": that pop up on my bill. On top of that, I get little to no signal at my house (though it is fine elsewhere) and my cell phone bill is super expensive. So I want to switch carriers. So which one is the best?

20060713221917AAq0qwF	Consumer Electronics;Cell Phones & Plans	Razr cell phone question?	I just got a Razr cell phone and I have a question about the camera.      When I take pictures and try to use them as wallpaper they stretch out and become pixel-like.  I think it's because when the camera takes a picture it is wider horizontally, but when it's used as wallpaper it's longer vertically.      Is there a way to change the camera so it takes pictures the size of the wallpaper and not have a piece missing at the bottom where the options are?      I know that I can center the picture in the wallpaper options, but then it leaves and ugly border around it.      I'm sorry if that didn't make any sense.  Ask questions if you have any.   thanks.

To All my Friends and those who are interested:      this is to let everyone know that I am a very dissatisfied customer with the Apple iPod 30 GB 7500 songs PC + Mac. I thought this was going to be a smart buy but  you see it started giving us problems after 15 days but now I have to wait on Apple to let me know when they can do something.this has been a big disappoint in this company! Isn't this a pain, after spending all that money on it they can't exchange it or refund the money right away but when it comes to taking the money they do that very quickly. So think twice if you want to buy an Apple product. I will believe me and I would like for you to spread this to your friends so to all my friends I would like to get this out and spread to as many people as possible.let me know how many people you have told. I do appreciate all your help thanks to my real friends.   Tina

Doesn't need to be too high-tech, just so the pics won't be blurry and will look nice in a regular 4x6 print.      I've heard the Fuji F30 is good for low light shots, but any reviews I've seen focus on indoor.

It's the type that needs a memory card to store any/everything, and I've got a 1GB card.

But when I right click, and go to properties, it says that I've got at least 40% free space left.    What's up with that?    Is about 130 songs equal to 1GB? Is it full, orr........ could it be something else?   Thanks in advance.

20090227141848AA3J0Dn	Consumer Electronics;Games & Gear;PlayStation	PS3 problems can anyone help? (Disc reading)?	Hi all. We have a PS3 which is nearly 2 years old, been fine until this week. It loads the game but then stops mid disc, it doesn't freeze it just gets to a point where you need to enter another room or level etc and stops, where it usually flashes so you know its loading and then it appears, its flashing but not loading. Its doing it on all discs. We have reset to default settings, no difference. For example - Everybody's Golf - when you go to enter the lobby it says its loading but doesn't load and Midnight Club LA lets you race but then when it loads another one it says its loading but doesn't, any ideas as to whats wrong? We've checked all leads/settings and cleaned it.

My grandmother had an account with Virgin Mobile, but they ended up causing us chaos(LONG story) and we really wouldn't recommend them to anyone.       However, my brother's 8th grade commencement is approaching rather fast, and my grandmother especially does not want to send him off to high school without a phone because the high school he will be attending is pretty rough(I go there too).       So my questions are:       - How much do text messages cost, and is there a way to get unlimited texting?       - The phone he wants just happens to be a tracfone(he just doesn't know) and it says that it has a camera and supports picture mail. Is the pic mail feature an additional cost?      - If you purchase a phone online, how long can you let it sit without activating it? My gram was thinking of ordering a phone online and having it shipped to our house. She really doesn't want to activate it until June. Can she do that?      She wants to enroll in a monthy plan of $19.99 per month, if she orders the phone and doesn't activate it right away, there's no way that they can charge her monthly until she does activate it, right?      Thanks-   Isabel

I have two ps2 games i wanna sell, and a ps2 controller that i have used just once in my whole life coz i got it free with a game. The two games are 'gran tourismo 3' and 'crash bandicoot - wrath of cortex'. I have an xbox 360 so these games and the controller are useless. I live in london, so could anyone tell me where I could sell these games and the controller. I would preferrably want AT LEAST 10 pounds, so that i can buy assasins creed - preowned for myself on the xbox. I would rather sell these accessories instead of letting them catch dust in my closet.      I also have a gameboy advance with three games - 'star wars the old republic III', 'tom clancy's splinter cell', and 'need for speed porche unleashed'.. I have four more gameboy games, three have 15 arcade games each... and the fourth  one is pokemon yellow.      Can anyone tell me where i could sell all of these...or if anyone living in london would want to buy these from me??? ....i would be terribly grateful.      Thanks for any advice....   If anyone wants to chat with me, my twitter is 'adisonic', and so is my flickr

I have a really important question for my band and would be sooo thankful for your help. I have a Digitech RP350 effects pedal which i use for effects and recording different sounding guitars and such. I noticed that there are 2 microphone ports along with the usb which i use to plug into my computer. My question is, if i buy a condensor mic can i use the RP350 as a preamp? I am not sure how all of this works but i just want the best sounding thing i can get for my vocals. Will the RP give me a great signal or would something be better? I want to try to save as much money as possible, but the mic I would be plugging into the RP350 would most likely be a $400 Blue Bottle Mic. Please Help and maybe when i make it big I will pay you back =]. Thanks guys!
