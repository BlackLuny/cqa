20090307165411AADCOYE	Pets;Dogs	Am i the only one who thinks all the fuss about pure pedigree breeds is BS?	i find it discriminatory towards hybrids and its just like Eugenics (Nazi Germany policies to remove the weak, disabled, "impure", and slowly sterilise them, and then take "the clean, pure ones" and breed them)      how is a pure better than a hybrid? except for that they are purely meant to do a certain job and u gonna know wat type of behaviours to expect, but at the end of the day i think hybrids are diverse, they could get positive traits from both different parents and become better than the parents      to all those who believe in pure bred is better pliz explain

20090307172813AAxc7bR	Pets;Dogs	What are some behavior problems that can result from not 'fixing' a 10 month old male dog?	Hes getting annoying as all hell. It might be lack of training but he barks/cries constantly lately.       He has been 'growing up' lately I guess you could say. He pees with his leg up now and he marks his territory on every other tree when we go on walks. This is not the problem it just seems to be proof to me that he is not much of a puppy any more. Although he's not agressive at all and he's too chicken to bark at other dogs unless they're on our property.      But yeah he's always barking/crying. Hes not the stereotypical 'yappy dog' either. He's german sheperd/rott. But over the past few months all he does is bark as if something is bothering him  or he wants something. He walks all around the house and barks. Its not his mean protective bark its more of a puppy bark like dog use to tell humans things. (if that makes any sense.)       Even right after I take him out and he poops/pees he still barks. I know its not because he needs to use the bathroom.He also has food/water all the time. So that's not it.      We go for walks and play, so he's not bored. He sometimes even barks in the yard when im with him.  He also seems to be escaping the house a lot lately and often ends up and another dogs house.      So is he barking/crying/escaping because he is horny or something? Or because he needs to be fixed? thanks

We have tried everything, we have made my son hosed down the site after he picked it up, spray the site with lime after picking it up, clips the grass on the site, etc…   My next door neighbor is even starting to complain about the smell. They have two dogs for many years and never had problem. Since we live at end of the block and behind us there’s nothing but a empty land. we’re just really grateful that we have only one next door neighbor who we’re on good term with.    We don’t know why the smell kept on lingering and getting stronger every week.

He loves anyone who comes inside my house, even if he has never met you before. We go outside on or off leash and its like Dr.jekyl and Mr.hyde. I have to keep him on leash now. I try to correct him by distracting him with a squeaker from a tore up toy. If he starts to growl and bark i get in front of him and make him sit down until he is calm. If he actually lunges i will lay him down and force him onto his side. He doesn't seem to be learning that he's not suppose to do that. He's agressive towards PEOPLE and animals when we are away from the house. He was socialized as a puppy, so it makes no sense. Anyone have any ideas or techniques that could help? i could really use some help here!

Does selling or giving them away often work? I live in Oregon so I'm not sure if pet stores will take them after I've raised them a bit.      Any suggestions would be nice. I have two female guppies in total, so I'm sort of wondering what I could do. I still get upset when a fish dies and I wanted this to be a calming project, not a cannibalistic horror show.

20090307233807AAE7nGs	Pets;Dogs	Is it common to for a dog to have difficutly urinating after trauma to its rear?	My dog fell out of my car window today and was injured. He has been hobbling around some and in pain. I took him to the vet and he said he did not see the need for him to have an x-ray because he was moving so well. He is having trouble getting up and down, but the vet feels that he will be ok, just going to be a bit sore and stiff for a while. He gave him a shot of prednisone and sent me home with medicine for pain and more oral prednisone to give him. After we got home I noticed that he feels the need to pee frequently, but when he does it is taking a long time. It's as though he is really having difficulty doing so. I wondered if this is something common with trauma to his rear end of if there may be something more serious.

20090227121908AA7oiP6	Pets;Other - Pets	Experienced Hermit Crab owners only please :)?	I posted a question the other day concerning my small Ecuadorian hermit crab (Barbosa) that had been attacked, losing both pinchers and all legs except for 2...(which are both on the right side)  He seems to be doing really well now (he is in Iso so no longer in danger from other crabs) but I woke this morning to find him buried.  He wasn't completely covered since his two remaining limbs can only do so much.  I don't want to disturb him since he could be stressed or perhaps preparing to molt but if he's only down to hide out for a while I'm afraid he'll starve.  I'm having to feed him by hand, he can't access his food dish by himself if he gets hungry.  I think I may just leave him be for a day or two as hard as it is to do that...Do you think that is best?  Any advice is appreciated.  Thanks!
20070123121101AAVDtRX	Pets;Dogs	The vet said my dog needs to lose about 10 lbs. What is the best way to go about it?	The only advice my vet gave me was to look on the back of the dog food I feed her...and to go by the chart on it.      However, I don't think that is going to completely work. My dog doesn't eat much dog food anyhow...it's all the table food we give her (I know, we're awful at that). So, what I'm thinking about is giving her the said amount of dog food daily....half in the morning and half in the evening. Then as snacks, I could give her little cut up pieces of apples and carrots (she loves them)..though, not a lot. Is that a good idea?      Also, she is very lazy. She is beagle/basset and the vet said that characteristically these dogs love to sun bathe and so forth. And, she does! I take her for walks, but it takes us about an hour to get one block...she has to stop and sniff everything. So, how can she get more exercise because if I just walk her she only sniffs?      Any advice is appreciated...thanks!

If you look a little way up on a cat's lower leg you'll find another "pad" almost as if it's a sixth digit there are bones in it but no claw.   What part of the body is it and what's it for?

20090227124119AA8Jlhf	Pets;Birds	Why adopt when you can buy for the same price?	There is a legitimate bird rescue not far from me. They are a not for profit 501 IRS and have been around a good 5 years.  There adoption fees are very close to a full retail price.  While some of the birds may have required expensive rehab care the vast majority did not.  This rescue is complaining that they are just not getting enough applicants, not suitable applicats but no applications at all. I contacted them and spoke to them concerning their adoption fees such as $500.00 for senegal, $100.00 for a cockatiel plus their requirement that you must buy a cage through one of their approved sellers and you have to actually make the order and payment on the phone in front of them!  I told them other reasons why they aren't getting applications such as only adopting out within a 50 mile radius and they are in a very rural area!      My question is why would someone adopt a bird at retail price or higher when they could buy a bird for the same and often less?      I think this rescue is selling birds and turning a profit.    Please don't email me asking me who they are as I won't say as I'm not out to get them just asking.

Do they prefer having a partner or being alone? if i get a boy and a girl, will they breed fast? how can you tell between a boy and girl?   2. what is the minimum size the tank should be? i need to know if i need to upgrade.   3. what is the best breed to get and how big does it get?   4. what is the best way to set up the tank to make them happiest?   5. how much does a gecko usually cost?

20070709145325AA3yrbb	Pets;Dogs	What should I do to make my dog less of a "bully"?	I have a lovely 1YO female Papillon dog. I have but one big problem with her; she is extremely bully-like to my 3YO male Yorkshire Terrier.       She knows she is not dominant over me and I think she is taking all that "I want to be the boss" attitude out on my Yorkie. If I find him doing something bad and say "no" she will go and bite him on the ear, disciplining him for me! If he is doing something that I do not like my dogs to do (stealing shoes, socks, stuffed animals, etc.) she will bite him on the ear and discipline him for me, even if I do not say a word!      If I'm walking through a door and my yorkie happens to go out before I do, my papillon will nip him on the ear for something so minor.      She also hates it when I cuddle him. If she ‘thinks’ I’m not looking, she will even nip him for ME cuddling him. He does nothing wrong in this case! And then when I discipline her, she rolls on her back and squirms all weird like- even if I say a simple “no”.      Comical, but I don't like it.

20070720231015AAOTbY5	Pets;Reptiles	Can u keep fish in a turtle tank? (I have an Oscar in there)?	I know that they eat the smaller fish, but what about big ones?  I have had a couple gold fish in there that were too big to eat, and about a month ago I got an Oscar to put in there.  The girl at the pet store that day said he would be fine, but when I went in the other day to get more feeder fish another employee said that the Oscar's waste was bad for them.  She said that in general all fish's waste was actually bad but especially the Oscar.  Is this true because I haven't heard it anywhere else?
