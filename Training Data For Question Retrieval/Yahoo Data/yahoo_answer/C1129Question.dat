20090223163058AAxxb2j	Beauty & Style;Fashion & Accessories	Looking for store similar to Urban Outfitters only better quality?	I absolutely love UO clothes but from the reviews on the website they seem poorly made and rip or stretch easily.  Is this true?  This bothers me because the prices are very high.  If they were low like forever 21, it wouldn't be a complete let-down.      So does anyone know stores similar to UO style?  Please don't say the stores forever 21, h&m, or macys, or really other popular stores.  Thanks.      And this is really random but does anyone know where I can buy fox jackets?  (Other than fox-girls.com) thanks

There's this girl. I asked her to dinner and she says, "Ummmm I'm currently dating someone." but her Facebook says she's single and if she was really dating someone, she wouldn't be always bored and have nothing to do, right?      Here are the signs she was giving:      - Continuously stares at me.   - I walked up to her today and she GLARES at me, completely wide-eyed and starts acting REALLY nervous.   - She non-stop smiles at me and flirts with me.   - When we walk around she literally goes and tells everyone that I have the coolest name ever. The way she acts with me, all the other guys we run into immediately get pissed and walk off (so now you know how she acts around me).   - The other day she stared into my eyes and then swiped her hair back.         ALRIGHT. So today, I'm walking out of class. She follows me all the way down and is making fun of me and teasing me the entire way down. So I suddenly say "Hey, you got any weekend plans?" She says "umm, maybe. I don't think so though." And I say, "Okay, you wanna have dinner on Friday?"      And she goes "ummmmmmmmmm I'm currently dating someone...but did you mean it like that? Or just hanging out?" (Thats a lie. Her facebook says Single and she never goes out with a lot of guys)      And I immediately say, "Ah, nah I meant just hanging out. We're going to a party on Friday..." and I backed off.         Alright, what in the world is going on here???? Is this her way of playing hard to get? Or did she just reject me? We're both pretty good looking, so I didn't think that should was the problem?

I want a kit I can just buy at a store instead of having to order it offline and wait around for it. The design I want is simple and easy to draw, a do-it-yourself kit would be perfectly fine because it would probably be cheaper than a tattoo shop doing it for me and I have a friend who can put it on me if I get the kit.

20090222153330AAMHkRN	Beauty & Style;Fashion & Accessories	Please Help!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!?	Okay you dont have to read through the whole entire essay i know its long, but i need help on creating a concluding paragraph. have any ideas? Thanks alot!!       Throughout history a diverse collection of cultures have discovered a numerous amount of crops such as maize, sweet potatoes and pumpkins! Did you know that the Native Americans of North America congregated the Spanish at the Rio En Grande River and, offered pumpkin seeds as a peace offering. Maize was primarily planted by the Native Americans by which they planted in a conglomerate system, known as the three sisters. Sweet potatoes were initially grown in Peru but over time they made their way throughout the world specifically in parts of Asia, where precisely ninety percent of the crops are grown. For years experts have assumed that the people of North America used the slash-and-burn agriculture as well as many other farming techniques in order to cultivate these specific crops.      The pumpkin was one of the many foods used by the Native American culture as they entered into the new world. Not only was the pumpkin used for feeding aspirations but, also for purposes such as constructing mats which were created by drying strips of pumpkin which were then wove together using string. Pumpkins were also a significant component when droughts occurred considering the fact that they could be easily dried and stored. According to the Cultivation of the U.S approximately 1.5 billion pounds of pumpkins, are produced each year, making it the largest crop in the United States! Pumpkins are considered to be a fruit; as a result ninety percent of a pumpkin is water. They are also loaded with an antioxidant known as Beta Corotene which helps improve one’s immune system. Pumpkins are also a prominent part of a healthy diet due to the fact that it subsists of calcium, iron, magnesium, potassium, zinc, selenium, niccin, folate and vitamins A, C, and E.                                        Maize as we know today would not exist if it were not for the people of North America. Experts believe that the people of Mexico discovered corn 7,000 years ago! From Mexico maize spread into an abounding number of regions such as Peru and Southwestern United States. The Indians utilized corn in many different ways. For example, during one point in history corn was used as money in order to trade for meats and different kinds of animal furs. Early settlers grinded corn into meal, which they used to make corn bread, corn soup, corn cakes, and corn pudding. Eventually, corn was transformed using special cultivation techniques. Corn is essentially a type of seed which comes from a wild plant known as teosinte. Corn subsists of a large amount of carbohydrates vitamins B and C, as well as proteins. As you may know corn is a component of the three sisters. What exactly is the concept of the three sisters? The three sisters are the three main crops of the Native American regions, which are known as maize, beans and squash.      Sweet potatoes are a Native American plant that were used as the preeminent source of nourishment during the time of Christopher Columbus and the Revolutionary war. Sweet potatoes are an extremely nutritious vegetable; it contains calcium, potassium, vitamins A, and C and also proteins! Sweet potatoes were cultivated in the region of Peru as early as 750 B.C, when Columbus arrived   6 minutes ago - 4 days left to answer.

20090222142456AAveaEP	Beauty & Style;Other - Beauty & Style	Is he just being  a kiss azz?	So I never really wear make up or anything and I just usually wear a cute outfit that usually consists of jeans and a cute top or a skirt every so often.      And sometimes on occasion I take the time to get dressed up like in a nice dress and everything and make up and I do something cute with my hair. And I ask my husband "Don't you think I look especially beautiful today?" And he'll say "No. you're always beautiful to me you don't need all that" and I think the nicest I ever looked is on our wedding day and even then when he introduced me to his relatives he just said "This is my wife Ivette"       But when I'm wearing jeans and a tank top and little or no make up he'll introduce me to meet someone and he says "This is my gorgeous wife Ivette" And if we go out I feel so unattractive compared to other women,and I think ppl look at him and think he could do betrer. He always tells me "You don't have to feel inferior to ANYONE" Is he just kissing my butt when he says I'm beautiful when I just look normal,and could he mean it when he says I'm still pretty whether or not I'm dressed up??       And just recently I went to a salon and got my hair dyed from it's natural color and it didn't come out like I wanted it to plus the lady cut it shorter than I wanted,and I was pissed. It used to be red and it was down my back, now it's a light brown and just a little to my shoulders and he said I'm beautiful no matter what my hair looks like. I don't even say thank you because I think it's BS.       I have to wonder what he sees.Could he be biased and saying this because I'm his wife??
