20060610220357AAm3OUw	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	My wife (soon to be ex-wife) lies to me regularly.  Should I call her out on this?	My ex-wife will say or do whatever provided it get her what she wants.  She will either omit key information or spin information in such a way as to make it appear that she is not lying. Also, she holds me to a higher standard then she holds herself.  And she tries to get me to commit to things but she refuses to commit to anything unless it is fun.  It amazes me that she can get away with it.  I am not sure if she does it only to me or not but I wouldn't be surprised if she did.  Yet, she donates clothes to charity, she spends time with her mother and grand parents and she is a pretty good mother (even though she favors our son over our daughter).  In short, I question her integrity.  I know she is my Ex but I still need to deal with her until the kids are 18-years old.  So it is troubling to me.

20090202104843AAMNpyv	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	I don't know what to do... I'm so upset?	I'm so sad right now I am the youngest of six 3 brothers and 3 sisters My mom and I have always been very very close we did everything together.But for the past 3 years I basically have no relationship with her. You see my older sister who I have been pretty close to has a drug problem she has 2 small children 5 & 9 and children's aid took them away from her Yada Yada My mom's their guardian now and she lives with my sister and is basically her slave her nanny and house keeper.For the past 3 years nothing has changed my mom is still there and my sis was suppose to get random drug tests but she screwed them around so much they aren't coming anymore.And my mom is so stupid she won't listen to anybody and by the way my mom is 75 years old and should be enjoying her life not raising small children while my sister sleeps all day.My mom is the kind of person is always helping people (LOSERS) and they always take advantage of her.We get into fights all the time because it's never ending all the bull-**** I'm afraid if it ever does come to an end I won't want to or even care to have a relationship with her It'll never be the same we use to talk every day and we saw each other once a week now I never see her.She forgets me and my kids birthdays and there is so much more to this it's like a soap opera. And to top it all off my oldest sister who I'm very close to is dying of liver failure and my stupid dumb *** mother still can't pull herself away form that situation she says she wants to but never does. What should I do I try not to think about her but on the rare occasion I do talk to her I get very upset and angry.

20090202111348AAVstKW	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I got drunk and fell down the steps after I promised my wife I would stop?	I fell down the steps a few nights ago at my friends house while drunk, after I promised my wife I would stop?  It was a few nights ago, she let me get out of the house so she could spend time alone with our kids. Im 23 and she is 19, I was with about 7 or 8 of my other friends (they were all guys). I promised Ashlynn (my wife) that I would try to stop drinking so much. After I was extremely drunk I fell down the steps. I only twisted my ankle, and I couldn't walk on it at all. They called Ashlynn and told her to come get me before I hurt myself any worse. The whole way back home she didn't walk to me, and she still hasn't talked to me this morning. Every time I say something she ignores me or leaves the room. I really don't know what else to do.
20090202111355AAXCeO4	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What would be the best way to go about this...?	My bf has been trying to get me to have a 3some with him & another woman for a while now. At first I wasn't into it because I haven't done it before so I told him now, but now I'm curious to try it at least once. He wants me to pick the woman. He has however expressed an interest in one of my friends, but we keep going and back and forth about her because of her complicated personality and we're not sure if she's into it. We all run in the same social circle, have all the same friends and are at the same parties at least a couple of times a month. I told him that it would probably be best if we went outside of the circle because it could cause problems if we tried it in the circle. Like say I bring it up to her and she isn't into it then I'll probably lose a friend or she'll go back and tell everyone and then they'll be looking at us funny or if she is into it, she may try to see him behind my back without me there & that would be against the rules and could ruin the friendship. So is it a good decision not to involve a friend especially one that runs in the same circle as us? If so where would be a good place to meet people who are into this sort of thing?

20090202111735AAju8Zl	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Are there actually any GOOD marriages?	My parents are getting a divorce. They waited until I finished high school to do it but they have been fighting and my dad has been cheating for 8 years. My mom said their marriage sucked from day 1. So I know how it feels to live in an abusive unloving house, but I don't want to go through it again.       Now when I think about my future, I'd want more than anything, to be happily married, but does that even exist? I know there are ups and downs, but it seems like the downs greatly outweigh the ups. Also, I go to an all girls school and I don't meet guys outside so I have never had a boyfriend. I don't know how it feels like to actually be in a relationship, or to have one and then have it go bad.       So I'm wondering, do all relationships suck like that or does anybody stay happily married forever?

My fiance and I (as well as my family) are very into medieval/renaissance stuff, so we are having a theme wedding.      My long-sleeved overdress is ivory, while the underdress is white.  I want an opaque veil that is more fitting with the period, and am thinking about getting this: (look halfway down the page)    http://www.revivalclothing.com/index.asp...       Problem is, would white look OK if the outer dress is ivory?  I could get a cream veil, but I have a silver circlet... seen here:    http://www.medievalbridalfashions.com/ca...       I'm thinking that wouldn't look very good over ivory/cream...      One other thing I could do is layer 2 like in the picture, with white on top and cream beneath...        Opinions??

However she will only have sex with me in missionary style (with me on top) and spooning positions...I think the primary reason is she is uncomfortable with herself because i said you should be comfortable with me enough by now, and she said im comfortable with you im just not comfortable with myself. She has a nice body, shes about 105-110lb, C cup and nice booty...im trying to get her to have sex different ways and try new stuff...how do i convince her that i think she should be more comfortable with herself and try new positions...she also refuses to get on top. what do i do?

I started talking to this guy at a bookstore, and I ended up giving him my number. He called me the next day, and we went out that weekend. We had a really good time, have a ton of stuff in common, etc.       We've gone out several times since, but each time I've been the one to call him/set everything up. He's only called me to invite me somewhere once, and that was to a get together at his friend's house. He barely talked to me the whole night, so I mingled with everybody else.      He texts me sometimes, but never invites me to see him in person.       He's never tried to kiss me or anything.       I really like this guy, and I don't want to just write him off, but it doesn't seem like he's interested, right? The only reason I even need to ask this is because he's told me he hasn't dated a lot and is very shy around women. Could this just be shyness? Or, alas, is he just not that into me?      One last thing: In case it helps, we're both in our mid-twenties.

20090203164240AAWic4V	Family & Relationships;Friends	Guy needs girls advice on friend situation (this is long)?	In high school I was going through a lot of major and hard stuff outside of school that was causing me to be shy/distant/cold/aloof especially in social situations.This girl who was a friend of mine had and still has no idea about any of this.At the time this was strictly a superficial friendship meaning neither one of us learned much about the others life outside of school.      Throughout the time I developed some feelings for her, but I was well aware at the time that because of the outside stuff it wouldn't be wise for me to act on them.I knew I was in a bad enough emotional state that a relationship would not work for me with anyone.      Senior year rolls around, and she asks me if I would have gone to the school dance with her if she had asked.I froze and never really answered her because I didn't and still don't know whether that was strictly a last minute impulse of hers to ask,whether she had any sort of feelings for me or if it was just a I don't want to go type thing.      She and I lost touch shortly after because of college a couple of years ago, but just recently got back in touch via email.She never got the explanation about why I was so distant and all that.I really don't know how much that shell and the guard I had to have because of my problems hurt her.Nor do I know how her not knowing is affecting things between us now.      My question is after all this time does she still deserve to know the explanation, or if because it was a superficials type thing and some time has passed is an explanation necessary?

My boyfriend and i were talking one night and we got on the subject of what it would be like to have sex in a pool, hot tub, etc..now, before I go any further I am going to say that whenever we have sex we always make sure to use condoms...well we were wondering if after sitting in a hot tub for a while would the sperm die and we would be able to have sex without the condom and not have to worry about getting pregnant...in other words would the sperm be dead when he ejaculated while having sex?

20090203164134AAivbIk	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	I need an explanation of something please?	I recently moved to a new area and have been trying to make some new friends here. I heard about a group of Christian college kids that meets on sunday nights and I went to a meeting. I met a lot of really nice people and heard about a women's community group that met during the week, so I went and I liked it a lot. This was last week.    I friended a couple of people from the group on facebook. This one girl who I thought seemed really nice wrote on my wall asking me how things were going, and we were messaging back and forth and she seemed like she was trying to make friends so I wrote on her wall in a casual way if she wanted to hang out this week I would love to, and then she never responded again. It's been about 5 days, and I can tell from her profile that she's been back on several times and definitely seen my message.    So what does it mean that she didn't respond? Does it mean she doesn't want to do anything, or does it mean she'll contact me when she wants to do something?

If he's not inside the house, he's sitting outside of the house using the internet because he has no service.  I can look out of the window at anytime after he's off of work and he's outside.  I don't want to keep my son away from him and he's not a bad person but I need my space.  My son do want to see him and he goes over his house almost every weekend and spends the night.  I just don't want to see him everyday.  Even when he has him on the weekends he still comes over acting like he forgot something or has to pick something else up for my son.

20090203165323AA9vpHE	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	GIRLS ONLY: I need help in regards to talking to girls?	I have met a girl at work but I am unsure whether she would want to date me. I am new to the job and so is she but she is 21 and I am 19. The problem is I have social phobia and anxiety and I am bad around girls especially but I always end up fancying every girl I meet and feeling as if they are too good for me and that they have already made up their mind that they don't consider me dating material. That said I will still make small talk with the girl but that is it.   I really like the girl at work but I feel at 21 she is way more mature than me 19, and she is looking for different things in regards to dating someone than me, or maybe she has already made up her mind I am out of her league   I need help because I am like this around every girl that I meet, what should I do?
20090203164818AA0N4uM	Family & Relationships;Family	How can I relate to the brainiacs in my family?	Okay. Me, I'm not terribly intellectual. I don't know a lot about history, science, politics or "smart" subjects. I have little interest in becoming an expert, and I don't feel stupid because of my own interests. On a regular basis, it doesn't bother me at all.      However.      I'm finding that, more and more often, I am unable to participate in dinnertime conversations with my immediate family, because they're all so da mn intelligent! I try to contribute what little facts and opinions I have picked up, but I get made fun of or told I'm wrong, or even just ignored altogether. I love being with my family, and when we're talking about something "mundane" like movies or news, it's great fun. As soon as somebody mentions Republicans or Romans, though, I have to drop my eyes and play with my food.      Is there anything I can do to a) stop letting it make me feel upset or b) be a bigger part of things, without having to study my head off?!?!

20090203164937AALHHsd	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Is he lying to me and if so, why?	There's this guy that I have been friends with for about 10 years. I've always thought we got a long well, and enjoyed each others friendship. He divorced his wife in 2006 and it was at that time that I let him know I was interested. At first I had just a crush, but in the past year or so it has become more than that. I made the mistake in telling him that. Afterwards he began confusing me. One minute he'd flirt really bad with me, asking questions that I would think only someone who liked you would ask. Then he'd back off and say something like "He didn't want to ruin our friendship." Then back again. Recently I suspected that he had a girlfriend, and that this is why he really wasn't interested. Truth hurts, but hey. I asked him and he told me no. OK. I bought it. Then one day I came across several pieces of evidence that point to the fact that there was something going on between them. When I asked him again, he said No, he's not dating her and got all angry with me. He told me that he would tell me if he was. Which, from the past, I know this not to be true. He also blurted out to me that we would never date because we don't get a long. I guess how I see us getting along is very different form his view of us getting a long. Anyway, my question is would a guy tell a girl "no, he's not dating her" if he was actually dating her. If this question has me so confused, and I'm sure I have confused all of you as well.Thanks for your input.
20090203165030AA0uoZU	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Why is "love" so complicated?	I love my boyfriend. We've been going out with what feels like forever and I've known that I could fall for him since the night we met almost two years ago. This is both the longest, strongest, committed relationship that either of us have been in. My past boyfriends have always said "I love you" after like two weeks but I NEVER said it back because I know I didn't feel it! Well my boyfriend told his first (last) girlfriend that he loved her and they went out for like a month or so and I know she was just on the rebound. ( I know this because she my cousin by marriage. I know its weird but in my defense i liked him before, while, and after they went out and I have not stopped having feelings for him ever.) But it seems like he's bent from saying "i love you to her" because he says he knows he will love me, just not right now. At least he said that when we talked about it a month ago. He says he doesn't want to be with anyone else and we make each other so incredibly happy but I'm wondering if he loves me! so I'm just looking on how to go about what to do and everything.

Also if they're bored with no $ex in the relationship, can't they have $ex with a condom since vasectomies aren't 100% effective?      I'm asking because no birth control methods are 100% and I never want kids. I could be wrong about vasectomies.

However, there is one thing I look forward to--seeing this one man. I am married, and I know it's wrong. When I see him I get a little excited, and when I don't, I feel a little down. Nobody knows this secret. I'm pretty attractive and I notice I get checked out a lot. I've caught him looking a time or two, but of course he has done nothing inappropriate and I haven't either. I'm just attracted/infatuated. My husband and I are not very intimate lately, and we went through a rough time a while back. I care a great deal for him, but I feel guilty with these thoughts. Also, I want to stay at the job and my husband wants me to as well. What can I do to remedy this situation? I'm not a bad woman, not yet anyway.
20090202105518AAKkgvH	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I want to be inseparable with my boyfriend?	I am in a very serious and fast moving relationship of 9mths.  We are already talking about moving in together and marriage and children etc.  However he still lives with his parents at the moment and his priorities seem to lie with them more than they do me.  Maybe I am just being selfish but take this for instance he took a week off work and could only see me for 5 out of 7 days of it because he said that he had things to do around the house like helping his Dad out with abit of decorating and bits and pieces for himself that need to be caught up on.  I was abit disapointed really because as it is his first whole week off work since we have been together I would have expected that he would have wanted to spend the whole time with me.  I am a Mum with children and would have to part company every day at 2.30pm anyway as it is mad that time of day.  His parents are quite pushy and expect that he helps them with everything from decorating to their paperwork for their business.  I can see there being problems if we move in together.  Am I being an immature selfish idiot?  All I want is a guy to want to be with me every second of the day is this totally impossible?  He is getting moaned at by his parents and me all the time.

20090202080235AAYhc5S	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Moving on & not looking back ?	I was engaged to marry a man, but it all went really wrong, very fast; we broke things off about a year ago. I found out that he got married to some woman just 5 months after the relationship was over. I have no proof, but feel he had been cheating on me & at the very least, he was dishonest with me. I have (& still am at times) feel the emotional effects from this break-up & can't seem to move on without looking back on this experience. I'm back with my long-term Sweetie now & can see the break-up with my ex-fiance was for the best, but I still think about what happened, what went wrong & where he is no. I feel so used & lied to. How could he get married to some woman right after we broke-up?! I'm just hurt, I guess.      How can I move on & stop going back to the hurt I felt?   How can I stop caring about whet he did & is doing now?

20090203171410AA7HuM3	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	So I like this guy...?	There's this guy that I've had a crush on since like October. He is literally the only decent, non-perverted, funny, and smart guy maybe in our entire grade. Two problems. One: My friend likes him too. But i's basically good, because we both agreed that we can crush on him and he probably won't ask us out because of problem number 2 (see problem number 2). Only thing is, my friend flirts with the guy. A LOT. And I don't think she even realizes it. Maybe it was an implied thing in our crush agreement that flirting is allowed? I don't know, but I have to say, it does bother me a smidge. Does that mean I'm a bad friend? I certainly hope not... Problem number 2: It's not even funny how many girls in our grade also have a crush on this guy. I mean, it's plain ridiculous. Annoying, too, because they all fan around him. Also, I don't know if the guy does this on purpose or anything, but he is just always so charming. I'm pretty sure he thinks of all the girls as friends, but sometimes I get a bit suspicious when one of the girls giggles a bit too loudly...      Thanks in advance! :)

She just recently got a boyfriend, whose 5 years older than her. when i heard it, my heart broke. i didn't expect my feelings would get me. i think the right decision is to forget our friendship, and never to talk to her again. i know i'll soon be happier, when im completely over her. what do you guys think?

20090203170059AAM1wrX	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	What do i do when he's just a butthole?	ok i dated this guy and he was really nice. he brought me home to met his parents and they fell in love wit me. well he broke up with me (for his ex gf). i didnt talk to him or his parents. his parents showed up at my new house and we went and ate and talked. for the next week we would go out and do things. well me & my mom had gotten into an altercation and i needed a place to stay, well they took me in. my ex still lives here. im nice but i leave him alone. when he comes in, i go to my room. he's spread lies about me. so what do i do? he's made his mother go into the hospital b/c of so much stress and im the one who went and sat with her...not him.    should i move out?   or should i just keep doing what im doing?

20090203170248AAvta1f	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Hubby's temper is bad?	he gets mad easily and definitely does not like to be told what to do.  Even when I'm NOT telling him what to do, he sometimes takes it that way.  His temper is bad and he gets destructive when p-o'd.  He likes to break things like glasses on a dinner plate or floor, or throw stuff into walls. He has poor communication skills and this is how he handles his being mad or angry.  He (obviously) would not take any kind of suggestion to get help learning how to deal better with his frustrations.  He would, instead, say that it is I that needs to "not make him mad".  He wouldn't be that way or do that if I didn't piss him off.  I know this is a control issue.  For the most part, I know how to be and deal with it, but moreso, I just don't know what will piss him off anymore.    It's like he can go off for anything and I don't have any warning signs.  I can be quite pressing and annoying at times and know I push things too far when I should back off.  I need to work more on that.  However, he just HAS to be right, or protect his ego if found to be wrong--and I think his protection is the show of aggression.

20090203170320AAJyCSn	Family & Relationships;Family	I've been exiled because I have a slight cold. What am I supposed to do?	I can't take it anymore. Everyday I get beat down more an more, by everyone and everything. I'm constantly getting yelled at for something, no matter how hard I try to things right. I don't even see the point in trying anymore.      Today I got a slight cold- just a runny nose, that's it.   My mom tells me I can't practice piano, can't touch ANYTHING...because somebody might get a ******* cold.    It's like I have a fatal disease, or something.    What am I supposed to do now? I've already touched everything I normally do, and I will continue to. I can't cease my life because of a cold...because of my mother. I can't stand her constant PMSing any longer.      Suggestions?   (Besides moving out of the house...I can't do that for a few more years.)

I'm a very eccentric person and I love indie music, but lately I haven't been able to find love. It seems like I've lost my luster. girls seem to want want guys with skinny jeans, wild hair, and muscles. It normally doesn't bother me but sometimes when I see couples walking down the street I think to myself that I would trade all my instruments and everything for somebody to like me like that.      I've had some nibbles but no bites. :( I'd like to find a girl with some same interests. some-days it's kind of like being in a Pound and every now and then I get looked at but no one picks me. I'm sorry this is kinda long but I hope you'll give me some advice. :)
20090203170425AAqUVAd	Family & Relationships;Friends	My friend and i volunteered at a camp last summer as instructors and now they are going to hire me but not him?	last summer my friend and i volunteered at a camp, planning to get paying jobs this summer, now i heard that they are probably going to hire me but not him, and hire someone else instead. I think it is because he seemed slightly less mature last summer, but he has grown up allot since then, and i don't think it will be a problem... now if they hire me and not him ill feel guilty and he will probably be a bit jealous,  how could i ask the people in charge to reconsider their decision and say how i think he will be more mature without appearing aggressive, or jeopardizing my position? thanks!
20090203170440AAQUN5l	Family & Relationships;Friends	How can we stop fighting?	My coworker and I get on each other's nerves.      Anytime I try to discuss anything with him, he takes it personally and attacks me by cutting  me down. For example, I was talking about feedback I got on project of his and he laid into me -- calling me emotional, insecure, and all sorts of other bad stuff.  I wasn't saying those things about his work, I was telling him what other people said. I wasn't emotional about it at all until he started in with ad hominem arguments. He only wants to hear praise, I was trying to discuss a marketing strategy with him.       And, anytime I tell him I don't like to be swore at or cut down, he tells me I'm too sensitive and emotional. And, tells me its my problem, not his and that I'm too mental and that I get on his nerves. Anytime one tries to discuss accusations he makes, he deflects it by saying, "see you are too emotional, can't you just drop it?? Any serious discussion has him ranting about how I over analyze along with other cut downs. So that my needs are never addressed.       Here is an actual thing he wrote.. This is why we get into frivolous arguments and debates because of your irrational statements. And if anybody has a problem with my statement then tell then it's their insecurities that make them feel that way, the same insecurites you have with me. Maybe you all can get together and diagnose your insecurities      I've asked other people and everyone else can see it that it's him. He doesn't get it. You can't explain anything to him, He won't listen to anything you say, it's all about him and his needs, and anything you disagree with means you are mental screwed up and can't handle anything in his book.       I mean really, this man has gone off screaming and yelling, and even broken golf clubs -- and tells me that I am too emotional and he can't stand my insecurity -- meanwhile, I'll just be standing there looking at him, thinking what the hell is his problem. How can I be too emotional when he's the one freaking out?

Monday has passed so does that mean that they aren't going to? I'm freaking out, cause I don't know what to say and  I'm hoping DSS has decided not to.

And whats this claim about penis size?... are they so stupid that they are forgetting I have real life experience and know its totally false.  I guess, white guys have been peeking into bathroom stalls in order to get their stats.

20070526020359AAZcSsS	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Any coping strategies?	Last night i bumped into my ex with his friends. He was with a date, typical blonde tall chick. I spoke to him and his friends, i also said to him that i just wish he didn't have to be so cruel after we broke up and he's like that's how i am (for a 22 year old, i thought what a ******* tosser). After all i've done for him he could be respectful to me. Later on in the night i'd keep bumping into him, and at one point i was talking and laughing with my friends in front of him and he was sitting alone and kept looking at me. When i was around, he'd ignore his girl and ignore her advances.  Later on that night he sent his best friend to see what i was up to, maybe to see if i had a date, or to see if i was ok? I stopped bumping into him later on, but because unfortunately i'm still in love with my ex loser, i can't cope anymore, it's been 3 months and i feel like any progress i made getting over him has been reversed. I also think i heard someone knocking at my door at 3am that night,?

20070623062954AA4h2lE	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I have small issue i have a  male prospect for a relationship. From what i remembered from my past?	relationships i always had problem with my body. When it comes to a certain point in the relationship comes. I haven't dated nor had sex in while and my body not all that great. I'm afraid he will become distigusted with me and my body. So what can i do to make this experience pleasant, i know i shouldn't be so embarresed of my body. The previous time i held my head the whole time because the guys would never say anything about my body. I don't know if it would be good ideal for us to take and strip and tell each other what we like about each others body without sex i think i'll be self esteem with this and not being so rejected to sex from because he and i would have had an understanding be more comfortable with each other. And will not have such a hard being naked in front of him without being guilty of not having a body like a model. Can anyone help.

Ugh, the reason why I ask, is cause' my friend (who's a girl) and I made a bet and the terms were that the loser will have to be the winner's slave for a week.   Well I lost, so now I have to my friend's slave.  So i thought she'd make me do chores or something.  But then! she mentioned to me that she knows how much I hate feet and is going to make my week "so incredibly humiliating and disgusting, AND unforgetful!" She added that since she "owns" me for the week that she has the right to volunteer some friends of hers.  Ok so anyway, she mentioned how during my first day as her slave, she was going to have three of her girlfriends come over and use me.  What does she mean use?? she said something about her not going to take a shower at all..DOES THAT MEAN WHAT I THINK IT MEANS?!?       would any of you girls actually make a guy do this?

20090202090701AAB8tnT	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is he not that into me?	I have been seeing a man for about 5 months. We are intimate, and have a good thing going on. The thing that is bothering me, is that sometimes he does not call for a day or two, when he used to call several times a day. We saw eachother almost daily, and now once or twice a week. I know that he wants to take it slow, am I just overreacting? I was previously married for 8 years, and since my divorce this is the first man I have been with, and this dating thing is very new to me. Am I expecting too much attention from a casual date? Or could he be seeing someone else, and doesn't want to tell me. He has said before that I am his girlfriend, partner, what ever, but he does not really treat me like one. Half the time, i do not know where he is, or who with. And he doesn't think I need to know..hence the lack of phone calls....what is up? Or is he "just not that into me?"

20090202092329AAaF18o	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does anyone out there know what it's like to date a partner who has schizophernia and depression?	I am dating a guy who has mental disabilities such as depression and schizophrenia.It is tough to deal with his moodiness because we have a lot of ups and downs in one week. Whenever we have a good day, it feel like I would never want to separate myself from him. Whenever we're having a bad day, he is the worst person I could be talking to. One thing I don't understand is that this relationship is so emotionally draining sometimes, so why do I stay in it? I feel as though I really truly care about him and love him, but he is so  much to deal with. I wish he would go and get therapy but he is having trouble with having motivation. I want to help him, but I don't want the stress to get in the way of me having my own life. I feel as though I cant get away from him, because I love him so deeply, and I really want things to work. I feel bad that he has this illness, and not too many people have tired to help him cope with it. He has feelings of anger, frustration, and emptiness on some days, but on other days he's full of energy. I wish i better understood his illness, though, but at the same time I don't want to lose myself in the process. What should I do?

20090202101534AA68AM2	Family & Relationships;Family	Mother in law HORROR, pls help, I promise to be brief?	Hi guys, I'll lay out my problem in line format in the hopes it would make it easier and less of a bore to read      I've been with my husband for 14 years   We have 3 young children   I was stupid at 17 and married him even though he and his mother smoked weed TOGETHER and she treated me like dirt. (12yrs ago)   When my children was born she was there for me   She has since tried to be nice but has never apologized to me   She is money hungry (I even paid for her to move out of her house 13 years ago)   My husband no longer does that, he has a great career and more importantly is an extremely devoted loving father who helps with the kids and the house   The problem is, I don't TRUST and I resent the heck out of his mother no matter how fake nice she pretends to be, she doesn't even call her grandkids but pretends she loves them so much. whatever.   Anyway, due to this and mistakes of the past, she is regrettably my mother in law and my husband (albeit a great spouse and dad) is a momma's boy.      Why can't HE see what a horrible person his mother is. WHO DOES DRUGS WITH THEIR CHILD??      He still loves her to death and was mad at me because he finally realized I don't want anything to do with her anymore and I don't want my kids going over there even if she stopped years ago. (so she says)      He says I should never try to deny her the right to see her grandchildren especially when she made a cake for him (this past weekend) but I honestly didn't even care enough about her to feel bad they didn't go. (The kids didn't know what she did)      OK, not so brief but if anyone can read through this I'd thank you with all my heart. What do you think, I could use some advice. Thanks guys
20090202145446AAQeM0k	Family & Relationships;Weddings	What did she mean by this?	I told my fiancee I cheated on her and got another woman pregnant. I feel awful about it and I'm surprised she didn't hit more or anything.       Well when I told her she just stared at me for a minute before I spoke. I said "Look, it's probably best I just go."   She said "I never said go did I? I never said I was breaking up with you"   I replied with "What do you mean?"   and she said "It's obvious you feel terrible about it otherwise you'd have not told me. Besides if you aren't here I can't punish you for being a cheating B******."      Before I went to work she looked at me like everything was normal and I went to kiss her as usual and she slapped me and told me I wasn't allowed touch her until she could trust me again. I can't deal with her being like this, I know I'm getting off lightly but we're getting married at the end of march. Or we're meant to be.

20090202112546AASAXS9	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	One of the boys. How can I get them to notice me and that I'm indeed a girl? ?	I'm a 16 almost 17 year old girl. I've always wanted a guy to notice me. I'm only about 5 foot and most of the boys consider me one of them. It feels like they don't even realize that I'm really a girl. I'm not the same little girl they played soccer and baseball with. I still like these things but I've grown a lot since then. It's not fun when all they talk about is how cute or hot different girls are, it kinda makes me feel ugly. I almost never wear make-up and I wonder if the boys think that's bad. I just want them to notice me for once in my life and perhaps even like me as more than a great friend and someone that they can laugh with.      I'd be forever grateful if someone could give me some advice. (Sorry if my English is bad. I'm from Sweden.)

20090202112902AAstUTu	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I TOOK A PICTURE OF HER ****. ?	I have a question. I am a 22 year old guy and I study in London , I have a very  good female friend (she is 19) from Bulgaria that studies with me, she is very quiet and very shy with almost everybody  because her English is really bad, but we are very close, from all the girls I know she is my best friend.  Like one months ago I got angry at her because of something stupid she did, and I told her that I will not talk to her anymore (it was kind of playing, she knew I was not really mad, I was just playing). Anyway we went to this house party on Saturday and she came and try to talk to me, I didn’t say one word, then out of nowhere she just said “if you start talking to me again I will let you take a picture of my ****”, so I went inside the restroom with her, and without me telling her anything she took out her shirt and she was only with her upper lingerie. She start to make sexy position and laughing, so I start to take picture with my phone, I ask her if she was going to take her lingerie off and she started to laugh even hard, like if she was having a lot of fun. Then somebody started to nook on the door so we stop and we just get out of the restroom.  Then we separated and we didnt see each other all night.    My questions is : do you think that she let me take pictures of her **** because: she likes me ? she was just playing and having fun ? or she had a bet with another girl ?   PS: she is really hot, blond, blue eyes and her **** are perfect I swear, she could have any guy she wants believe me.        She was not drunk.    So what do you think ?

20090202115520AAxnFCq	Family & Relationships;Family	My cousins dad wont let her eat..What can she do?	My cousin is 17 years old, and her dad found out that she wasn't   a virgin and went over board.      He stopped letting her speak to her friends, (even me. her own cousin   who lives 2 states away) Wont let her out of her bedroom (she's home    schooled. So she doesn't even leave for school)   And he wont let her eat.      I know that he has every right to not let her talk to her friends,   or not let her go out of her room (even though I think it's way over   board) But he can't just not let her eat. That's wrong in so many ways.      He wouldn't let her have food for 2 days, and then she snuck out   and left home about 2 weeks ago. She wants to go back bc she   misses her mom, and doesn't want to leave her younger brother.   But her dad says that when she comes back home he wont let   let her eat for 24hours as punishment.   She already have diabetes problems.      Can he legally do this?   And if he can't, then what will happen to her if she calls the cops?   (He also beats her. I've even seen that myself)   She's afraid of being put in a foster home..But will it come to that if   she does call the police?
20090202122454AAjEoXI	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My boyfriend is dying (long. Please read)?	he's been my best friend for 2 years, but he's only been my boyfriend for 6 weeks. He went to his doc last week cause he wanted a physical and yep, he has all sorts of problems with his lungs/liver/pancreas. Too much to list. The doc said he has 5 years at the most. I've been crying ever since. He's 45 and I'm 31. He won't return any of my calls now, because he wants me to move on....he wants me to marry, have kids, and just move on instead of "wasting" my early thrirties away on a man who wil never be able to get married or have kids. it feels like a part of me has died. i miss him so much. i will never be able to move on. i want to see him through this. my dreams of having a husband and a baby aren't in my radar and I will never be able to date and marry anyone else, especially while the man I have always loved is dying. i want to be with him. but he isn't returning my calls. My dilemma is this now: My lease is up in 2 months. I have the option of renewing, but if he sin't going to allow me to be a part of his life...I'd rather not stay here. I'd rather move back to my hometown and be with my friends and family. I don't know what to do. What if he calls me in a month and says I can he a part of his life now....a month is too late. I have to make the decision now as to whetther I am going or staying. But if I stay, *hoping* that he calls, and I sign another lease, and he never calls......I'm stuck here without any friends/family. I will sit in my apartment by myself and wonder about him. Not healthy. Please help, I am so sad and so confused. What would jesus want me to do?? What should I do?? Again, we have only been bf/gf a short time, but BFF for a very long time. We have talked on the phone everyday for 2 years. This is so hard.

If you'd already planned a date with another woman, is it fair to cancel because you found someone else?      Isn't it like saying that she was just your back up, there to have fun with until you found someone worth committing to?

20090202123408AAhAqzg	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	If a man makes a hurtful comment about your breasts, and trys to claim he was just joking, was he really?	The first time my boyfriend saw me naked, he made a hurtful comment about my breasts, and then tried to say he was just joking.  He said he was trying to picture me with DD's, and then he said the neighbors would say you finally grew a pair.  Now I am a 34B - I have a pair thank you very much, and am quit happy with them including their size.  This really hurt me, and made me feel uncomfortable with him.  He said I took this out of context.  I'd like to know how? If I made a comment like that about his penis, I think that would make him feel uncomfortable. He's tried implying that he's not into big breasts, but has made comments since then to imply otherwise.  Not to mention he's never tried to counteract his so called joke by giving them a compliment, such as saying they are nice, etc. He says he touches them a lot and that should tell me something.   When I asked him what he thought of them, he said don't get mad at me when I tell you the truth, and then he just said they were small, like it was a negative thing.  Was he j

20090202123811AAR5SgM	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does she like me? Did I handle this ok?	Me and this girl in school are becoming friends. We've been talking alot, and have been spending alot of time together. We had dinner at her place, watch TV together, and chat after school. I think she likes me, but I'm not sure. I know I like her.      We had a disagreement over something. She wanted to go to a party with me. So we went. But I didn't tell her that I had to leave early the next day for something else. So she had to get a ride with someone else back home.       She was mad at me the next week, and we didn't talk too much. Then she messaged me. She wondered if we could talk sometime, alone.      So the next day in class we went down the hall, where it is private. And she said that she was a little mad and hurt that I left the party, and that I should have told her I had to go. I agreed, and apologized again.      Then she said that I try to be friends with everyone in the class, even with this group of girls who never seem to want to do anything with me. She wanted to know if I liked her, and if I wanted US to be friends, or if she was just another person to chat with sometimes.      I told her that I really liked her, because I can be myself around her, and not have to act all social, when I'm actually shy. And I said that I'd like us to keep getting to know each other better. She smiled and said yes, and we hugged.      So I think this is past. What do I do from here?

One morning my very bestfriend in the entire world came over to my house in the morning. She told me about her depression, a fight her and her mother had gotten into, and how she then continued to try and hang herself. This was her third attempt at suicide. I decided to deliberately stay with her, and skip school to comfort her until the next day where I eventually told the school and she recieved medical attention and was evaluated by professionals. We were caught skipping school and my friend and I were both given saturday detention from 8am-12. I was punished for doing the right thing. My mom told my school principal to give me TWO saturdays, while my friend only recieved one. I am so livid I could punch something.       Sidenote: Our school health textbooks instruct us to stay with someone who is suicidal until they recieve medical attention.

20090202150700AAFM7Ii	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Georgia Divorce: 50-50 custody. Child support.?	Does anyone have any knowledge. on GA divorces?  Me and the STBX are going for an uncontested divorce and we have agreed on all the property stuff, and child support.  We agreed that i would not pay child support but would handle all his bills like medical insurance , medical and other fanancial needs. As well as any money needs during his days with me.     My concern is that i am afraid even if we go through a mediator and she agrees to no child support will the courts over turn this decision?
20090202154759AAVAqT9	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Whats a good way to get your guys fantasy out of him?	Ive asked my husband his number one fantasy and he says he doesn't really have one ; /...kinda has me a bit surprised.  I always thought everyone had one, maybe not.  Now he does tell me going down on him is a fantasy, but geez, i mean, ive done that plenty of times lol.  By fantasy i mean FANTASY...im just not really sure how to get it out of him, i would do anything he wants ;)...just looking for some tips on how to find out.
20090202152802AAwrIJ0	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Please Answer, about a fantasy, is it weird?	I love my husband very much, but ever since I hit puberty (give or take), i have always fantasized about having sex, and being forced. I dont want to call it rape, bc i cant imagine how horrible it would be for that to happen. Its actually a very particular fantasy, more along the lines of being wanted so much that he just couldn't help himself if you know what i mean. Anyhoo, ive discussed this with my husband many times, and its almost as if hes afraid of it, so unfortunately its never happened. Just wondering if maybe this fantasy is too much to ask of him. I totally understand about maybe being uncomfortable with it, but i totally love and trust my husband and i know he would never hurt me. Guys and girls how would you react if your partner asked this of you???      Again i stress that i dont mean any disrespect towards anyone who has ever experienced being raped or anything along those lines...and i dont condone anything like that. Its just something that i always wanted to experience with someone i love ;)      Ive asked before, but not getting alot of responses, ill let it go after this one lol, and just come to the conclusion that im weird lol.

20090202152304AAVHida	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Does this count as abuse?	My dad is always getting really angry and can never control it. Whenever my mom does something wrong he shouts really loud and is constantly telling her she is an idiot and ruins everything. He has also slammed doors repeatedly so much that I think they could break and has broken some things. And all the arguements they have had are over really trivial things. I'm worried about the effect this is having on my mom, who now has really low self esteem. Are most families like this and what should I do about it?

We are the same height. Most people say i'm prettier then her in the face. She has anger issues, and I'm mellow. She has no butt and is an A cup, while I have a butt and i'm a C cup. She is kind of wierd, although I kind of am too. Shes shy, but she has outbreaks where she screams something random like " nur shaw plane". I don't. I have more guy friends then her. She farts really loud all the time, and she never thinks twice about it. Yet, she gets really cute guys to like her at the drop of a hat, while I find it very hard.

20090202152633AAe6nzQ	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Have you been emotionally blackmailed/scammed by your wedding photographers?	Hi there,      I was married last year, and went through a very bad experience with our wedding photographers. Basically, we agreed to an album of $2500, however were deceived in the final pricing until it was too late to pull out, and effectively emotionally blackmailed into paying more than double the price. Their package details and pricing was very deceptive, not specifying how many photos are required to make up an album, therefore charging for more. We ended up receiving our album 8 months after the wedding, after numerous excuses made by the designer of this company pushing back appointments. Their customer service was appalling, and was by far our worst experience through our wedding.      Since having gone through that traumatic process, we have now discovered a few other couples who have been through the same sort of emotional blackmail, and even as bad as being held in the studio against their own will until papers were signed. This is absolutely outrageous, and we do not want this happening to any other bride & groom planning their perfect wedding.      Due to certain risks, I don't want to mention the name of this company. However, if you have been a victim of something similar to this with a photography company in Malvern East in Melbourne, please contact me. On my few visits to their studio, I was able to speak to a few other couples who seemed to have been going through a rough time with the photography couple, though I now wish I had exchanged details.      Please contact me or reply to this post if you think you have been involved in the same form of abuse by this company, as with a number of similar stories, hopefully our action will save other couples from going through this like we have.      Thanks!   Sally ;)

20090202150203AASv7ZL	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Have you ever liked someone for more than four years?	i like a guy very much, or i think 'used' to like him therefore i'm asking this question now, and i only see him from time to time. he likes another girl i know and it is universally known. no one else knows that i like him. yet, at most times he likes to talk to me and sometimes he looks at me in a strange way for a long moment where his face would all be smiling and his eyes stay wide open. and he treats me with respect and sometimes also he teases me like touches me and so. but that was a long time ago when we used to spend more time together (not alone). but also sometimes, he acts weird like he wouldn't talk back to me when i try to make a conversation, he would talk terse and so, and sometimes he's cold.    so i know there's this weird, very weird relationship. I don't know what's going on. the problem is he's way younger than i am.    with this other girl, i have always wondered what i could be to him, if anything?   thx for reading this.      Also we have the same interests but i dont think that's important.

20090202145921AA8N13d	Family & Relationships;Friends	My friends mooch my cigarettes A LOT?	As we all know, smoking is a pretty expensive habit. Every time I pull out a cigarette, i have a few friends who ask for one too. I dont really mind sharing every now and then, but I have these 2 friends who overdo it. Neither of them have ever bought a pack in their entire life, they just mooch cigarettes off me, and I actually BUY my own with my own money. Its gotten so annoying, esspecially since they dont even smoke them. They both have asthma, so they admit to just holding the smoke in their mouth then blowing it right out. Its a waste and im tired of paying for it.      So basically, how can i tell them to knock it off without being really rude? Cause they are still my friends... Im just so tired of it.

20090202153143AAfN3ze	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I want to get married at sixteen?	My girfriend and I are both sixteen, in our second last year of high school, and engaged. We've been engaged since the beginning of grade ten. We've never really talked about when we want to get married, but both know we want to. Anyway, all of a sudden we want to get married right away.       We are both christians, and both our families support our decision to get married, but they don't know that we want to do it right now ( i mean get married, not have sex, cuz we agree to only do that after we are married). We've talked to a couple in our church who got married at sixteen, and they said it would be hard to make it work, but not impossible.       She says it would be wierd to go to school as a married couple. I know that some of the guys already make fun of me for staying with one girl for so long. My closest friends support us.      The questions I have for you are....      How do we tell our parents?   Do you think we should wait until we are older?   Where should we live.. her house, my house, or rent an apartment?   Is it even legal to get married at sixteen in Ontario, Canada?    I love her and want to be with her for the rest of my life, she is the one for me!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

When is it ok to date?  Some people say wait till the divorce is final, others say once your separated it's a go!        My thoughts are if two people agree the marriage can not be fixed and a divorce is the best thing why wait 6 months for a piece of paper.  Start your new life ASAP.       BTW... we have been separated since November.

20090202150355AAHkIUw	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	This girl is confusing me?  Please help (long)?	OK, so there's this girl that I work with at Publix, and we're both 18. She's gorgeous, friendly, funny, everything I could ever hope for in a girl.      After a couple of months of working together, we became pretty good friends. I eventually asked her for her number, saying...   "Hey, let me get your number. You know, so I can annoy you whenever I want to."   "(Laughs and gives number) Now, you have to give me your number, so I can annoy you back."      A few days later, while I was working and she wasn't, I played a joke on her through text message. She told me, "Haha, your so mean! But I still love you!" Then later on, she came into work and jokingly hit me on the back, telling me how "mean" I am. As she left, she made her mom stop the car so that she could yell "BYE (My name)" out the window. Another worker that was nearby told me, "Man, you're so lucky. She definitely likes you." Oddly enough, that same day after I got off work I went to the mall with a friend, she was there. She saw me, and ran up and hugged me so hard it nearly knocked me over. That night, we were having a good conversation through text messaging.      The next day, I tried texting her again, but her responses were really bland and uninterested. Almost as if I were annoying her.      About a week later, there was a concert coming up so I invited her to come along with a friend and I. She said she couldn't, because she was going to be at her dad's house. (Seems like an odd excuse to me. :/ )      A couple weeks after that, I was in the aisles of Publix, stocking shelves, when she came back and started talking to me for a while. Then she said she was leaving, gave me a hug, and left. When I finished stocking, a friend of mine asked,   "Hey, are you and (the girl I'm talking about) going out?"   "No, why?"   "When I asked her what she was doing, she said she was looking for someone. Then she walked back to where you were. She likes you, man." (Note: This is a different friend than the one that was convinced she liked me before.)      However, the other day I offered to give her a ride home (she can't drive yet), and she said that she didn't need one.      About a week later, she mentioned,   "Man, I hope I don't have to walk home in this cold."   "Oh, I can give you a ride home if you want."   "No, that's okay. I have a ride, I just hope it doesn't cancel."      We're good friends, and we're always hanging out and talking to each other at work, and I've gotten to the point where I can't stop thinking about her.      She has my number, but has only texted me without me texting her first a couple times. I've texted her a few times, but I don't do it a whole lot so I don't seem desperate.      Where should I go from here? I really can't tell what this girl is doing, so any help would really be appreciated.      Thanks you for all your help! :)

20090202150405AAkcaWw	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Is it ok to have this girl as a friend even though i have a gf of one year?	Is it ok to have this girl as a friend even though i have a gf of one year?   Saturday i went to a party with my bro and we were there for a while and this girl there liked me and she was really cool, she gave me her number and ive been talking to her on the phone the past couple days, i dont want to have a relationship with anyone else but my gf and we do plan on getting married in a couple years but i dont know why i did not say i was seeing someone,idk she was so cool i guess but i only want to be friends with her just someone to kick it with or whatever on a friendship level. My gf is real insecure and i know this would be a huge problem with her. I would feel bad in a way if i just drop this friend i have even though it probably would be the right thing to do. Would it be wrong to just have her as a friend? I used to have like 3-4 other girls beside my gf then i stopped that a few months ago because she is really good to me and i love her and dont wanna ruin things.

20090202151522AARdDxd	Family & Relationships;Friends	I need help getting a real friend?	I just moved for the first time.  I'm a shy and quiet person.  I've been trying to be extra friendly at my new school, but I haven't really clicked with anyone.  Everyone's nice and some girls have been kinda talking to me, but everyone seems so stiff and extra polite around me.  I've been feeling a little depressed because I can't find any real friends.  I try to reach out and be nice, but I'm not used to being funny, loud, or comfortable.  Whenever I talk to anyone, I can't think of anything to talk about, my mind blanks out.  It feels like my "buddy" (the girl that shows me around the school) is just being nice to me because she has to, not because she wants to.  How can I make more friends?

20090202150820AAirIkg	Family & Relationships;Weddings	How do you avoid a guest at a party?	There is to be a party – a ‘re-taking of the wedding vows party’ and it has been arranged to take place on a train which sounds rather exciting. Three private coaches have been hired for the occasion and all the guests know each other.      There is plenty of booze about and party games have been organised etc. I am on board at the moment with my laptop and everyone is here ready for the off in about an hour.      Thing is, I have just found out that there has been a late invitation sent to a twin sister of someone I know called Hattie. Now, no-one has ever met this twin so I can’t understand why she was invited but if she is anything like her twin I would prefer to avoid her if I can – difficult on a train I know but her twin is really wild.       I mean, don’t get me wrong – I like to have fun like anyone but her sister would always take things to the extreme and I’m concerned that she would probably do the same notwithstanding the fact that she is considerably older than the rest of us.      Is there any way at all that I could avoid her on a train? Any suggestions would be appreciated. Thank you

20090202150842AAGkRqY	Family & Relationships;Friends	How do I get over a broken heart? (Please help)?	This going to be rather long. Anyway, my boyfriend of 5 years was incarcerated for 2 years in February of '07. I made the choice to stick by his side. He told me that he didn't expect me to be faithful, but don't fall in love with the guy. So anyway, the whole year of 2007 I worked and went to school and got my degree. The following year I got laid off from my job. I didn't get a job until May of 2008. Anyway last May I was bored and so I decide to contact some of my old high school classmates on myspace. Some of my classmates added me some of them didn't. The last classmate I added and he responded immediately. He gave me his cell phone number and told me to call him.He told me that he was a marine and stationed in North Carolina. However, he was coming back to our hometown in Aug for good. I swear I have never ever had chemistry like I did with him. He even said it. He was like you know I don't know what is about you, but I'm really drawn to you. So anyway I told him I had a boyfriend that was incarcerated for 2 years. I showed him recent pictures of me and he said I was very pretty. He was reluctant to become my friend since I had my boyfriend. But we ended up talking every single day for hours on end. However, we decided that we would have sex only one time when he got back home since I haven't had sex for at least 16 months. I admit I loved talking to him. He had a very soothing personality. He would literally call me everyday to tell me any new updates in his life. So as the time got closer for him to come the more I got nervous because I never ever cheated on my boyfriend. At first I decided not to do it, but then I changed my mind. When he got here the first night we rented a hotel room and sex. From the time he got in my car we couldn't stop kissing each other. We agreed that we would only have sex once. However, it didn't stop there. One night on my way to work he called me and told me that he needed to meet me some where to talk. Anyway, he confided in me what was bothering him. Then we ended up having sex in his car. The last time I saw him was in Aug. He invited me over his efficiency he was staying at since his parents kicked him out. He loved cuddling with me when I was in his presence. We spent the day together watching movies, buying lunch and dinner, talking, and we couldn't keep our hands off each other. He was like why do we keep seeing each other I thought this was one time thing. I told him I don't know. I guess after that he decided to distance himself from me. However, he told me what apartment complex he was moving to and I told him I was happy for him. Then he called two weeks later and told he was sick and had bronchitis. I asked was he alright and did he needed anything. He said no he was fine. So told him I would call him later on to see if he was alright. When I called him he answered the phone immediately. We chit chatted a little bit and was like he was waiting for me to say something because there were long pauses between our conversation. A month goes by (Oct) and I see on his myspace that he's a new uncle. So I him texted congratulations. He texted me back immediately and said thank you so much. Two months goes by I sign into myspace (I get on myspace once a month or every two months) and I swear as soon as I signed he put a picture of him and his new girlfriend. I was hurt, but, said well he found somebody and I respected that. Then last month he sends me message through myspace stating to call him on his cell phone and typed his number in. However, I didn't get the message till 4 days later. So I sent him a message asking him was he ok and was it ok to call him. He sent me a message right back stating naw that wouldn't be a good idea I was drunk and mad at my girlfriend. sorry.. I found it to   be b.s. because 1. he has at least a 1000 friends on his myspace page list and I'm like on the very bottom of the list. 2. I changed my name to my nickname two months prior and I never told him my nickname. 3. How did he know that I didn't have his cell number. Plus has drunked dialed and texted me a few times and he when he did I couldn't understand anything he said. So my response to him was yea ok and I haven't contacted him since. I noticed while we were on myspace he took his picture down of him and his girl. I must admit I do miss him very much and I think about him a lot. I was trying to get over him since my boyfriend is getting out like at the end of this month. Why the hell do I miss him so much? He's the only guy I ever considered leaving my boyfriend for. It feels like brick landed on my heart. We're both 26 yrs old. Thing of it is. I'm the one who told him we should only have one sexual encounter and that's it. We did talk about potential relationship, but I was so scared I'd be making a big mistake. He once played a joke on me and texted me that he was not coming, because he reenlisted in the marines. I texted him how long has known this. He said two weeks ago.

20090202150923AAlya3k	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Two guys at the same time...?	I have been dealing with this issue for the last few months. I am not sure what to do. Maybe you can help.       I feel like I love two guys at the same time. One of the guys is my current boyfriend and the other is one of my ex-boyfriends. That sounds terrible and you would have to know the WHOLE situation to understand. But, I am not sure which guy is the true "love". They both have qualities that I adore, but both have qualities that I can live without. You will probably say my ex is an ex for a reason (I did not make him my ex), but the time we have spent apart has almost made us grow closer. I am at the point in my life where I am not really "dating" anymore, I am looking for someone to spend my life with. I want to give the right guy my undivided attention!       In my head, I know what I WANT to do. But, I am too afraid to do it. I am not one to take risks. Nor do I want to make a mistake or regret something.       My current boyfriend is a religious guy (something I look for) w/ a great family! I know he cares about me, but I feel like he cares more about himself. He is a personal trainer-has a great body! He can get upset easily and doesn't go out of his way for anything. And he doesn't have REAL conversations unless it is about something he is interested in. We do a long distance relationship (very hard!). He is back in school and we have less time to talk AND no idea if he will ever move closer to me. He tends to talk and not do. He is a romantic guy ( a major plus!).      My ex-boyfriend is a great guy, but does not go to church (he is Catholic, though). He comes from a very easy-going family. He will do ANYTHING for anyone. He has always been that kind of person. But, he doesn't like to go out very much..a home-body (I am not!). We still even as friends have arguments. And I can think back to our relationship and remember a lot of that. He is somewhat romantic. I can tell him anything!        Please help me! I DON"T know what to do!!!! I am so confused right now.

20090202151352AAt2jQd	Family & Relationships;Friends	Why is everything against me?	Ok, lemmie start out by giving some background. I am a 10th grade guy, asian, and pretty quiet. I am trying out for the tennis team. I did not make it last year.      Last years varsity team seems to not like me very much because I wasn't good at tennis. When I arrive on the first day of tryouts, one guy says "Hey kid, the asian bus is that way!" and he points at the short bus.      So tryouts continue, an underclassman friend of mine is there, 8th grader. We were in orchestra together and we were kinda each others friend's friends, but we never really talked to each other that much. He is pretty, well...mediocre at tennis, but hey, hes my friend so I go easy on him at tryouts. Let's call him Justin.      I am a pretty quiet kid at school, but theres a 10th grade friend of mine who always seems to be there, funny, and always keeps my spirits high. His name is Chris. And his little brother, 7th grader, Bryce, is trying out for the tennis team too. I baby them because neither is very good at tennis, but I never notice when coach walks by and he always sees me playing extremely bad and he thinks im as bad as I used to be.       Theres a friend of mine at school, lets call him    to be continued.

20090202151913AAmOQ2i	Family & Relationships;Weddings	How to tell your parents you are getting married?	We got engaged on Saturday, and he made me very happy. This is what I have wanted for a long time :) We have kind of talked about it, and now it's really happening. I'm very excited!    We are not in high school anymore, hell, we aren't even in college anymore! Now, I consider myself to be lucky and accomplished. I graduated from high school at 17. I graduated from college at 20 with my Bachelor's in Computer science, and I got a high-paying job within 2 months of graduating. He also has a high-paying job and has his degree (we met in college).I have been dating my man for a little under 2 years, and I feel I am ready to take the next step..the BIG step. I love him with all my heart, and want to start a family with him...eventually.    Now, the dilemma: My mother HATES my fiance! She always has. He wanted me to marry my last boyfriend, who I didn't think was right for me. She loved him and was extremely disappointed when I broke it off. I have tried to have her accept that he was not the person for me, and she doesn't understand it.      Every decision my fiance and I have made together, she has lectured me and told me that I wasn't ready and it was a bad decision. The 2 biggest ones were when he decided to stay in this state instead of moving back to California. My mom hated that. Next, we visited his family for Christmas, and my family didn't like that either. I'm afraid she won't be happy for me.  My dad, on the other hand, really has never said anything -- good or bad.    My options:  Rude -- call on the phone or send an email, lol.  What my fiance could do--take my dad out to dinner and ask for his blessing, then tell him we are engaged.  What I think is best--- take them out to dinner and tell them together. I want my mom's support and my dad's blessing and it is very important to me. I want to tell them this. I want them to be excited with me and help me plan.     We are planning on doing whatever I decide this weekend. So, anyone have this same situation, or any advice? Thanks!

20090202154401AAiaL2U	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Girls, do you like bad boys?	I have always been more attracted to the so called bad boys and I even married one. It has worked thus far but I always wondered why dont the all around nice guys excite me at all.    I am not a dramatic person and dont get into fights etc and consider myself to be more of a 'good girl'    So do you rather date a 'bad boy' or the ' nice guy'?

20090202152109AAaUQ9W	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	The date was nice, but then....?	So, I met a guy from an online networking site.  We first met (spur or the moment) at a public place in the middle of the night.  We talked for about 2 and a half hours until we were told we had to leave.  He had work the next day, so we decided to call it.      The next night, he invited me to come hang out with him and some of his friends at a bar near where he works.  He and I were the only ones not drinking, but everyone seemed to have a good time.  We laughed and talked.  I had a blast and really enjoyed meeting everyone and hanging out.  A few different times during the night, he got really snuggly with me, but never kissed me.  He seemed like he wanted to, but didn't for some reason.  (I know it wasn't my breath because I stay on top of bad breath and bo. lol)      After the bar closed, we sat in my car and talked until security told us we had to leave. lol  I hugged him goodnight, and he told me to text him when I got home. (He didn't make that request the first time.)  When I got home, I found that he had texted me saying that he had wanted to kiss me, but he was unsure and that he was glad that I came out.  I replied in agreement and went to bed.      That was the last time I heard from him.  I texted him once on Saturday and once on Sunday.  I don't want to feel like I'm stalking the guy, but he had invited me to more events after that night and even texted me afterwards sounding quite positive about the night.  So, what gives?      I'm not the clingy type of girl, and I generally don't even bat an eyelash whether a guy keeps in contact or not, but in this case, I kinda like the guy.  I've reached the maximum number of unanswered texts that I'm comfortable sending without feeling like a stalker.  I guess my question is: Does anyone have any ideas about what may be going on? and What's the best way to just let this go?      Thanks for reading.  I know it was quite a lot to read.

20090202152138AAfMxyP	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Confusing situation with this girl?	Ok I'm in college and theres this shy girl who really doesnt talk to a lot of people but she has a few friends. She started talking and I can tell she really likes me by the nonverbal communications and how I catch her stairing at me, now I just found out she has a boyfriend back home. When we talk she only mentioned him once. Now I told her that I liked her but I knew she had a boyfriend and everything and she acted so differently to me after that it was actually really awkward. Then she text me saying she was sorry i got that impression and she loves her b/f but i am confused because she did like all the nonverbal signs that a girl likes a guy and would stare. All I said is that I thought she liked me so wouldnt a normal girl with a strong relationship with her b/f say "I'm sorry I led you on and we can be friends? So why is she avioding me and not talking to me?

20090202152158AA6WGuc	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Was she uncomfortable? I can not tell...?	Last time when me and my girlfriend watched a movie, I was holding her hand while that same hand was wrapped around here body. Our heads leaned against eachother and I would kiss her on the side of her head every so often. Then she would move the hand holding her hand closer to her breast throughout the entire movie, it drove crazily more attracted to her. When the movie end, we started to make out. I thought that she wanted me to put my hand on her breast because of the movie thing, so I do slowly. She does not resist at all. I move my hand back down so I do not seem like that is all I care about. But then I return, the same happens. Then on the third time, her arm is in the way, I slowly try ease up, and she does not move it like she doesn't wants me to grab it. I then head down to her butt, but once I go over that once she turns it over to where it is unreach able, we are laying down. I was not being to agressive with her breast, I was barely even caressing. Now I feel really guilty as if I violated her. What should I do?we have been going out for seven months if that helps...

20090202152724AALExN4	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Invite his high school sweetheart to our wedding?	My fiance and I are about to finalize our guest list for our wedding. A few nights ago we were watching some wedding shows on TV and he asked me "what is the most expensive wedding you had ever been to?" I answered him "I haven't been to many weddings but I would have to say my sister's was the most expensive." He replied "my high school sweetheart's was the most expensive one I have ever been to." After that comment he gave me this look like he just had a brilliant idea and instead of facing what I thought he had to say I changed the subject very quickly.      Though I don't know what he was actually going to say I have a feeling he was going to ask if it was okay to invite her to our wedding. I'm not sure that I would be comfortable with that. I need opinions on what I should do or say if this question does come up when we are finilizing our guest list.      Side note- yes they do consider themselves as friends to one another. They don't talk on a regular basis, but they'll talk once or twice a year to catch up with each other.

20090202153055AAN0vuW	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	When two people are married, an one wants out....?	how does the other one cope with the rejection. They have hurt one another many times in their 4 yr marriage. He wants the divorce, she doesn't. Said he hadn't loved her for two years, they had a planned pregnancy of this child during this two years. He was always with her at all her appts.Why did he want the child then, if he claims to not have loved her during this time. Now, a child has to suffer, not having a father and a mother both in the household. Bringing a child into the world doesn't correct their mistakes. He won't go to counseling, says he is done. Have heard from many that they both ask about each other, but they are unable to communicate. Actually, he told one of her friends that he was divorcing his crazy wife.   I want to help her, but I don't know where to start, except to just be there for her. He has broken her spirit, and soul. He said he would never get a divorce, they would always work things out. She believes in her vow in the sight of GOD. For better, or worse, in sickness, and in health. Guess he doesn't, everyone I speak with says they don't understand, they looked like the perfect couple. That he has turned into a person no one understands. She read her devotional bible daily, hoping GOD will show her the way. The divorce will be final soon, and he think he made the right decision of filing. How can I help????? She loves him more now than before, but he has blinders on. Can't see past the pain they may have done to each other in the past. I just feel her pain, an don't know how to ease it. Or how to get him to listen.

20090202153606AAApIJg	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What do you think he thought?	I've been hanging out with this guy that I really like, let's call him Mike. Mike's got a friend named Scott that I've been liking a lot lately too, but Scott thinks Mike and I have something, which we kinda do, but nothing we want to announce to everybody. Mike, Scott and I had made plans a couple of weeks ago to go to the movies yesterday. Well, last Friday, we were at a party and one of my girl friends started flirting with Scott. I got very jealous but didn't say anything to anybody.      Then yesterday, Scott txt me that he invited my girl friend to the movies with us. Then Mike txt me that he doesn't feel like going to the movies, so I txt Scott and told him that I didn't know if I wanted to go because Mike wasn't coming with us. He then said "we'll be there, come if you want to" and I said "ugh..no, I don't want to spoil your date." I felt bad after my girl friend txt me to ask me why I wasn't going and she convinced me to go with them, and I convinced Mike to come and at the end, my girl friend ended up leaving because Scott wasn't paying attention to her, all he wanted to do was talking to me about whatever!      I wonder what he thought when I said that I didn't want to spoil their date, my friend thinks that Scott now thinks I like him because I said that, is that true?

20090202153629AAX0Tuo	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do you think he is lying? (long)?	I have a boyfriend. It will be a year Feb 17. Well, Everything was great until about 8 months in. Literally we never had a single fight, not one! I was so happy with him. I do still love him. I am only 17. he is my first serious boyfriend and I don't want to hear about all this it's only high school drama blah blah whatever. Well, around 8 months in he was texting my best friend (he dated her a long time ago) and telling her he missed her and stuff. and he liked her. well she tried to tell him to stop and stuff. then around November he started talking to a girl that he hasn't talked to for years. He goes to a tech school for part of the day (he is still in high school too) and thats where he seen her again. They started talking and stuff. Well the end of December he was talking to her about kissing her and stuff he shouldn't say to anyone but his girlfriend. (did i mention she has a boyfriend) We broke up and got back together but htings weren't working so we broke up again for about two weeks. we still said i love you and stuff. i do love him. then we decided to get back together and the next day i looked a his phone (i know!) and she had texted him and said how she doesn't understand how things went bad after they had sex. after what they had together and stuff. he didn't really deny it when he was talking to her. but he did to his best guy friend and to me. i want to believe him. i do but everyone else, all my other friends don't. I don't know what to do honestly. i can't go through breaking up with him again. it hurts so bad and i love him. i want it to work. i don't know anymore. i want to believe him!!! god i do so bad.

20090202153939AAkvb4F	Family & Relationships;Family	I think my mother has found out I've been using her camera, and I'm a little nervous to talk to her?	I'm 18. My stepfather and mom own a digital camera. Sometimes I use it when they're not home to take pictures for school projects, ads, or for photo editing. They won't ever let me use it, that's why I go behind their backs. AND i know why, it's because they have pornography pics of themselves on the memory stick, but since I accidentally viewed a picture when i was twelve, I never click on their picture files, I only upload them to my computer, then delete them from the memory stick to remove all traces of my using the camera, and then put it back in their room the way I found it.       However, a few days ago I used their camera, and I think I forgot to delete a picture before I put the camera back, although the picture I forgot to delete could easily be regarded as an accidental photo (it's very indistinct and blurry/white). Anyway, today I got an email from my mom saying she "wants to talk to you. Don't reply on the internet. I want you to be serious.". I have a feeling it's gonna be about me using her camera, or maybe about finding my box of condoms and asking if I've had sex in the house. Anyway, can you give me some advice, I don't want to fault under pressure and make it seem like I'm lying.
20090202154023AAt2nxO	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I am over-reacting or is this going to ruin a possible relationship?	I've been talking to this guy for about a year and we both like each other. However, we both don't feel like we are quite ready for a relationship right now. We have really great connections and many similarities but not too many that we are the same person. We both have messed up older siblings and that has affected both of our lives greatly.       However, on Saturday night, he told me that his older sibling has tried to kill him when she got mad and I've been in the exact same position. Will this make us closer, or will that kind of thing possibly ruin our future relationship?      This isn't an ongoing problem for either of us, and both happened years ago, so please don't answer anything about calling the police for them endangering us or something like that.
20090202155251AAt6mVf	Family & Relationships;Family	How do you deal with people making comments about you being a single mother?	I made some bad choices when I 17 and 18. I dated a real scumbag but now I have 2 wonderful kids out of it. Their 4 and 5. Recently I started dating a wonderful man. He is white though and I think that is why I am hearing some of these nasty comments. Unfortunately he is also from the burbs of Chicago. I think people from the burbs are alot more ignorant then people from Chi town. The other week he took my children and me out to an arcade type of place like gameworks or something like that. Well I kept hearing comments from other white women saying that I was just using him for his money or that I was just trying to get knocked up again so I can get more money. And plenty of other hurtful things. I know they were saying it just loud enough for me to hear. It almost made me cry. Then even people from my own race will make comments (black men). My bf keeps telling to F*K them and who cares what they say as long as we have each other. But it still makes me really upset. Why do people have to be like this? I mean for months I thought that no other guy would even want to come near me because I had kids and I was so depressed about it. Then I met Mike and everything changed. But now I am getting depressed and sick of people making such ignorant hurtful comments. Is there an easy way that I can just ignore all these people?

20090202154422AAhqayc	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Need advise on spouse who had cheated?	I need some advice on what to do in my situation.  I have been married for almost 7 years.  I have 3 children (5yr, 3yr, 2month).   I love my wife very much and have always been faithful to her.  About a year ago I found out that she cheated on me, I confronted her and she lied about it and finally I told her that I was willing to forgive her if she told me the truth.  She said she only slept with 1 guy and I told her I forgive her and we move on.   She said she was over that and it would not happen again.   Fast forward to recently, she told me that she really slept with 5 guys and wanted to have a sexual experience with another woman.   I told her that I saw that as cheating and she did not think it was.   I told her that I needed her to be committed to only me for me to stay married to her.   She told me she was unsure if she wanted that and eventually told me she loved me and wanted to stay with me.         I want to stay and hope to God it works for the kids, but I am very scared that I am just getting ready for more problems.  Let me know your thoughts good or bad.  Thanks

20090202155753AApHTO4	Family & Relationships;Family	I feel as if my life is pointless; what should I do?	I feel as if my life is going no where and that there is just no point to it. Everyday I wake up, go to school, come home, do my homework, and sit in my room all night, go to bed, and repeat. My family is not close at all, none of us ever really talk. My parents fight frequently, although it was more when I was little than now.   I can't even get out of the house if I want to. It is freezing outside with lots of snow, and everything is at least a 40 minute walk and I can't ask my parents to drive me anywhere because my dad is always at work or drunk, and my mom can't drive. Even if I did get to go hang out with people my age I don't have any money to do so, my family doesn't have much to begin with and definatly nothing to spare.   I thought of signing up for something, but the only after school club I could join only runs one day a week for an hour after school, so I go to that, walk home and repeat my daily life.   I just don't know what to do anymore! I get picked on in school, and even more through honesty box on facebook. I know I am not pretty, and I have kind of accepted it, but I have in no way learned to love the way I look, I just don't see how it is possible. I am embarrassed of my dad's job, and our income, as most people at my school are much better off. I try to be thankful but it is honestly really hard ...   I just don't see how I deserved this life.. I am as kind as possible to everyone I meet, I keep good grades in school (All A's with the occasional B). I am turning 16 next month and I won't be able to get my drivers licence because there is no way to afford it and I can't even get a car to drive in the first place.

20090202160057AA9rYlv	Family & Relationships;Friends	Am I asking too much from someone I consider to be my best friend? Do I need to let go?	I've been friends with a good friend of mine for a year. In that year a lot of things have happened, both for the good and the bad. He is someone I have considered to be my best friend! When we first became friends, he would always make time for us to hang out, we would go have dinner, go to the movies, or just go and talk, slowly we got closer and began hanging out more. He would call me and text me and want to hang out pretty much every other day. Then his girlfriend went on vacation for the summer, and we started hanging out even more. During the summer, we would hang out talking for hours, going to lunch or dinner, going to the movies or the drive in. Just hanging out, and we grew really close. Later his girlfriend who I have never met, decides to randomly send me a really wierd message telling me to leave her boyfriend alone the he was hers. I replied back nicely being like what are you talking about. She replied back talking crap to me, and I replied back telling her who is she to judge me, she replied back saying that I was judging her and she started saying more crap to me. I got upset and without thinking much of it, replied back telling her to F**k Off B*tch. I told my friend what I had said and although he told me he wish I hadn't said that, he was cool with it. The next day he stopped talking to me for 4 1/2 weeks because his girlfriend made him. We were later able to work things out and talk things through, but things have never really been the same. Before the fight, if we ever had an argument he would always want to talk and fix things, if he knew something was wrong, he would get me to talk to him about it. But after the fight, all we would do is argue about stupid things. Then we went for about a 3 month period where things were going really well, we were talking more like before, we weren't arguing, things were good. I went on vacation for a week, and that whole week he was constantly texting me and calling me, and couldn't wait till I was back. The first day I was back he was wanting to hang out and we hung out the whole day. Things were really good. But then for some reason he just started pushing me away again. Not sure why. I've talked to him about it, and he says nothing is wrong he just doesn't have time. Before he used to make time for us, now its like he never makes time. He gets upset with me because I get upset about the fact that he isn't making any time to hang out. I understand he has his own life and he has a girlfriend, but am I really asking for too much for him to make time. At least talk on the phone or text message me. Something! We work every weekend together like we always have, but I want a friendship outside of work too. Is that too much to ask for??? One thing that I found out about recently is that he had made a promise with me not to drink, I later found out he was drinking behind my back and lying to me about it. He later admitted it, but now I don't trust him completely about it, and he gets upset when I ask him if hes been drinking. Another thing that just came up, is we made a promise to not have sex, and he broke that promise too, he told me he didn't want to but his girlfriend wanted to, so he couldn't just tell her no. I somewhat think that him losing his virginity is part of the problem, thats when he started pushing me away. He wants me to be cool about him having sex, even though I'm not. What am I supposed to do, just go about it as if nothing happened and its ok for him to be doing that? I don't know! Do I care too much??? Am I asking to much from him??? I really think things would be different if his girlfriend were not in the picture, but it doesn't seem like that will happen.      FYI, he has been with his girlfriend for 3 years almost off and on. He has also cheated on her, but has never told her completly.      He is 17, I'm 21!      He also has told me he doesn't think much of friendships anymore because he's been hurt in the past!      WHAT DOES EVERYONE THINK ABOUT WHAT I'M ASKING????

20090202160155AAeMFGb	Family & Relationships;Family	Whats your opinion on a stingy grandmother?	Ok, this is kinda long but i wanna hear wat you guys have to say:   Ok so i'm going on this trip. I was suppost to sell raffle tickets for it which i did. 1st place was a 26' plasma tv, 2nd place was a coach bag with a value up to $300 and 3rd place was 2 basketball tickets for a professional team. 1 ticket is $5 and a book of 5 is $20. There was like 39 of us selling these tickets through out our neiborhoods all spread out through this state. Each person got 200 tickets each (not sure). i sold most of them and had my daddy buy the rest because hes paying for the trip anyways so i figured he might as well try to win these prizes since hes going to have to pay anyways.Ok so the drawing was a couple days ago and my raffles won the first 2 out of the 3 so i was like yeah. My friend won the tv and my grandmother won the coach bag idk who won the basketball tickets. Oh yeah Not to mention that i was asking 4 a coach bag for christams and i didn't get 1. My grandma isn't even into coach so wateves i was like ok so she could give me the bag since she doesn't even know what to do with 1 but no.  Also She didn't even want to buy the tickets in the first place, she had a big stink about it so my aunt who bought like $60 tickets for herself bought another $20 book 4 my grandma meaning she bought was like $80 in tickets being4 books.My aunt was like fine i'll buy ur ticket but let her(grandma) write her name on the raffle and she won but she didn't even buy her own ticket meaning techinally that the coach bag is my aunts. Got all this   Ok so yeah my grandmas really stingy and mean and a b**** about $ and she has alot of $  so moneys not a issue with her shes just really cheap and shes single idk waht her deal is. Ok so she won and shes all like im getting a free coach bag going on there website picking out the bag that she didn't even deserve to win. so i was like g-ma can i have the bag since i've been dying to have 1 and u know wat she said to me?   u can have it as long as u give me $100 4 it.   i was like grandma but it free but she was like so i need $ even though she doesn't. My own grandma was gonna charge me 4 a bag that she was gettin 4 free wats with that and shes like that with my mom, aunt her sisters, everyone that probably y she has no friends. but you'd think because were family she'd give us slack but nope. Whats your opinion on this?????????????????? and the whole thing in general???

20090202115507AAxcLWy	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	What would be the best way to go about this...?	My bf has been trying to get me to have a 3some with him & another woman for a while now. At first I wasn't into it because I haven't done it before so I told him now, but now I'm curious to try it at least once. He wants me to pick the woman. He has however expressed an interest in one of my friends, but we keep going and back and forth about her because of her complicated personality and we're not sure if she's into it. We all run in the same social circle, have all the same friends and are at the same parties at least a couple of times a month. I told him that it would probably be best if we went outside of the circle because it could cause problems if we tried it in the circle. Like say I bring it up to her and she isn't into it then I'll probably lose a friend or she'll go back and tell everyone and then they'll be looking at us funny or if she is into it, she may try to see him behind my back without me there & that would be against the rules and could ruin the friendship. So is it a good decision not to involve a friend especially one that runs in the same circle as us? If so where would be a good place to meet people who are into this sort of thing?

20090202163846AAgrlRu	Family & Relationships;Family	How to cope during a Family Tragedy?	My dad recently passed away after being electrocuted and falling off a ladder at work. His accident was very unexpected and has devastated our whole family. I am only 19, and I never thought I would lose my father so young because he was a really active healthy man.       I am also very worried about my grandma (my dads mom)...she is 85 years old and was staying with my dad while this whole tragedy happened. She is now back home (Europe) and all alone. She is completely devastated and I am worried she will die from sadness. My dad and grandma had such an incredible bond, and he did EVERYTHINGGG for her, and she is in shock that he has died before her.      But we cant let her live with us because we have our other grandma to deal with (she has Alzheimer's). Dealing with my other grandmas Alzheimer's has also been extremely stressful while we are trying to grieve.      Please help me get through this terrible terrible family tragedy. My dad was the greatest man to ever live and I still cant believe that he is gone.

He went to his doc last week cause he wanted a physical and yep, he has all sorts of problems with his lungs/liver/pancreas. Too much to list.  The doc said he has 5 years at the most.  I've been crying ever since. He's 45 and I'm 31. He won't return any of my calls now, because he wants me to move on....he wants me to marry, have kids, and just move on instead of "wasting" my early thrirties away on a man who wil never be able to get married or have kids.  it feels like a part of me has died. i miss him so much. i will never be able to move on. i want to see him through this. my dreams of having a husband and a baby aren't in my radar and I will never be able to date and marry anyone else, especially while the man I have always loved is dying. i want to be with him.  but he isn't returning my calls.  My dilemma is this now: My lease is up in 2 months.  I have the option of renewing, but if he sin't going to allow me to be a part of his life...I'd rather not stay here. I'd rather move back to my hometown and be with my friends and family.  I don't know what to do. What if he calls me in a month and says I can he a part of his life  now....a month is too late. I have to make the decision now as to whetther I am going or staying.  But if I stay, *hoping* that he calls, and I sign another lease, and he never calls......I'm stuck here without any friends/family. I will sit in my apartment by myself and wonder about him. Not healthy.  Please help, I am so sad and so confused. What would jesus want me to do?? What should I do??

I understand that accidents happen and sometimes boyfriends and girlfriends end up having kids together and things still work out.

20090202163657AAmyfN3	Family & Relationships;Friends	What is happening between me and my best friend?	Basically I've been best friends with this guy for about 2 years and we've got on really well, seeing each other more or less every day, until now. In the last couple of months we've only been seeing each other at weekends, it seems to take me like a million texts to persuade him to come out or come to town or whatever, it's not like I keep bugging him because it's just the same as it ever has been and I don't text him that often. Now he only ever seems to want to see me for a favour or to borrow something, he doesn't want to see me for me if you get my drift...      Today is a prime example, he asked if he could borrow my xbox memory card and I said yes, he popped round to pick it up and stayed for about two minutes before going, about an hour later he came back to me with a group of about three other people, he wanted to use my back garden as a safe haven as he had just thrown a snowball at a car and didn't want to be caught. After being in my garden for a few minutes two of the lads with us went home leaving me, my best friend and another dude who I get on well with also. This guy needed to go in for dinner and as soon as he did, my best friend went in as well, it's like he didn't want to be with just me like he has done for years.      What's happening? Is he going off me or is it just like a bad patch?      Should I say something to him?      Cheers guys.

20090202161324AALpVUB	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Should I make her a bridesmaid - or just invite her?	I am very good friends with a girl I go to college with. We have been friends for a year or so. We see each other almost everyday, email each other back and forth, etc. We go to college together but we are from different towns. She's from a town about 2 hours away from mine. She is definitely invited to my wedding, but lately I have been thinking about making her a bridesmaid. I'm not sure though, because she doesn't know any of the other bridesmaids or anybody in my family. I would hate to make her feel out of place or uncomfortable since she will not really know anyone but me at the wedding. Of course she can bring someone along, like her mom or a friend.    What should I do? Should I make her a bridesmaid, or just invite her? Thanks in advance!! :)

I told him I was.He replied,"Ok.Stay there.I'm coming to get you.I’ll show u the way,just stay put." 5 mins later he pulled up and I followed him to the party.Now,he drove bout 5 miles round trip to find me,in his truck that’s a gas guzzler,when he could have stayed @ the party & watched the national anthem--I would have eventually found the road.Why did he do it?I've known brad 4 bout a year,but we're not like close friends.Was he just being really nice or does it sound like he likes me?We r both 17,btw.

20090202160512AAR4YEF	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Stupid... or just me? *prom and general question*?	Alrighty, so I've met this guy through some friends and we've been "dating" for since the end of last year... we haven't talked about being exclusive- I have just assumed so. (aka I have been asked out and turned them down..) anywho.   I want to ask him to prom, and I'm pretty sure he kinda knows I will. I'm a senior (he's younger) and so he is probably assuming that I might.. I don't know when or how to ask him. I mean, I could just turn to him one day and be like- hey do you want to go to prom with me? I am not shy to ask him, and it's not like I won't or anything. But if I hear any ideas...      I was also wondering how many other girls get in this situation and wonder when/if they are going to decide to "commit"/establish the relationship.. is he just too young still? or trying to get to know me first? (I'm not expecting you guys to know, it's just a few questions I ask myself)   I am really just looking for anyone with an idea or experience as a pick-me-up. THANKS!

20090202161724AArKDz8	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I Take My Ex-Girlfriend Back?	I was going out with a girl for about a year. Most of the time until the end it was long distance. I cheated on her early in the relationship and I revealed it to her months later. She and I were trying to get past it and 4 months later she broke up with me. Saying she wanted to focus on school.     A week later I asked why again and she said it was because she couldn't trust me and we were always fighting.    Fast forward to now (2.5 weeks after the breakup) and I'm basically over her but she is begging me to get back together. She's telling me she loves me and she made a mistake, massive crying, etc etc. A few problems though:  1) She has a new boyfriend who she's been having sex with and I can't get past that.  2) She made out with another guy besides her new boyfriend    Basically the fact that she moved on and HAS A NEW BOYFRIEND and having sex is making this difficult for me. Any help?

20090202161812AAFxtL0	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Are virgin men a turnoff?	This is especially targeted to women that are no longer virgins. Would it be a turnoff to date a guy that is still a virgin. I'm a 20 year old college sophomore and have never had sex. I'm 6'7" 245 lbs pretty good looking with a muscular/athletic body, I'm really smart, nice and friendly. Sometimes I feel like a girl wouldn't want to date me because she's had sex and wouldn't want to wait for me to be ready. I've had chances with drunk girls, but I want my first time to be when I'm in a very serious relationship. So would it be a turn off or not to date a guy like me because I don't plan on having sex with you until we've been together for awhile? Or is it a good thing?

20090202162222AAecNJv	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I am getting ready to take my ex-wife back to court full full custody of our three children.  ?	My ex-wife and I have been divorced for two years.  We have joint custody of our three children ages 13, 10, and 8, with her having physical custody.  She lives five hours away and the kids come to visit me every three weekends.  For the past two years I have watched her parenting skills crumble.  She has kept doing numerous little things causing me to question her lack of judgement as a responsible parent.  Some examples to name a few, she has had 2 live-in boyfriends within the last year, she allows my 13 year old daughter to hang out at places where little or no adult supervision is present. I also caught my daughter with a Myspace page, which had totally inappropriate vulgar, violent, and sexual material on it.  It was me who had to inform my ex-wife about this- she was oblivious to it.  She exposes my children to a shady clientale of people, one of which told my 10 year old daughter how babies are made.  She and her friends frequently drink around the children.  When the kids come to visit me I have to trim their toenails and fingernails because they are filthy with dirt.  My son's toenails even begin to curl around due to neglect.  The children's clothes are dirty, worn, and too small.  My 10 year old daughter came to visit last spring with a pair of underwear that were size 2T.  Keep in mind that I pay support in the amount of nine hundred dollars every month.  These things are light compared to her latest episode.  Last weekend she and a group of her friends were drinking in front of the children.  She got into an argument with my 10 year old daughter and locked her out of the house at night in cold temperatures.  When she locked her out of the house, she threatened to get back together with her ex-boyfriend who my daughter does not like and yelled **** you at her.  My daughter was locked out of the house for nearly an hour.  Later that night, my ex-wife and her friends went to a club in a neighboring state and left my two daughters ages 13 and 10 home alone.  When my daughter told me this story, my heart absolutely broke for her.  I knew it was time to step up and take a stand.  I have to get all three of my kids out of that environment.  My youngest two children want to come live with my wife and me, and they are willing to tell this to the judge.  My oldest daughter will want to stay with her mother, who is playing the part of a "big sister".  My wife and I both have excellent jobs, own a home, and can provide a very stable and safe environment for the children.  My ex-wife does not have a good job.  She has moved to three different rentals during the past 2 years, she has a shady group of friends, has had 2 live-in boyfriends, and recently even got into a drunken brawl at a night club.  I've always heard that it is almost impossible for a man to get full custody of his children, and that a judge will rarely ever take children away from their mother.  I have already contacted the police and DSS about this incident.  Based on reading this, what do you think my chances of receiving full custody are?
20090202162049AAHbigq	Family & Relationships;Family	Should I come out to my mom and sister about being a cross dresser?	First of all, I'm 15. I'm completely 100% straight and not transsexual. I still love girls, I still love sports, and I still love video games. I have no desire to be a girl, I just like wearing their clothes. I only cross dress at home when no one but me is home, but for some reason the pressure has been building up inside and I feel like I have to tell someone now or I'll explode. Plus, I've been stealing my sisters panties and clothes, but it doesn't feel right anymore, and I'm hoping if I come out to them they'll except it and maybe get me some of my own girl's clothes.       Also, the fact that people discriminate against cross dresser's pisses me off. I don't understand what people's problems are. Girl's wear guys boxers, pants, sneakers, shorts, shirts and sweatshirts,and its completely fine. But it's completely weird if a boy wears panties, bra's, leggings, heels, skirts and dresses. I hate that. I think society should just except cross dressers, because who cares what we're wearing, they're just clothes.      Anyway, I need help. Should I tell them, or should I still keep it a secret? And if I do tell them, how should I do it? Serious answers only.
20090202162114AAs3jtI	Family & Relationships;Family	Why does my boyfriends 11 month old seem to not like me?	My boyfriends 11 month old daughter is very cuddly, playful and loves to smile...she plays great with other kids and LOVES her dad.  She is great with me when he isn't around or when she can't see him, but the second she sees him in the room or she knows he's there she screams bloody murder...she doesn't want me to hold her, she won't me let me feed her or change her, and sometimes if he has to go to work and I take her she screams her head off, sometimes until she finally falls alseep.  If I try to comfort her sometimes she screams even more.  I just don't understand, John and I have been together since she was born so she knows me just as well as him, and even though she's not my daughter I treat her as if she is my own.  I'm just totally beside myself, babies usually love me, but I just feel like she HATES me...please help.   :(

As I stand there telling my students to get ready I quick, glance over at my toughest student, Thus what I see is, Eyes filled with such sadness, such terror, and a face with so much hatred; A mouth with so much to say but little to speak of, ears filled with so little praise, but so much horror, thus words spoken to that should have not, A black whole mistaken for her heart, A body with so much ache so much pain thus inflicted in, And with little sound I hear her quiet screams of pain from past, I see past tears drip from eye to neck never to be wiped away, I look into her mind, what I find is a look into the past. I see her running, trying to find a way from her mother. Thus I look away and onto the next...      What do you think Is it bad? Is it good feel free to criticize I can take it I promise.

20090202162254AARRZKE	Family & Relationships;Family	What should i do about my annoying mother?	im fourteen years old, and my parents got divorced in august.  I Was Alright With That, Though.  They Sent Me To Counseling- Which, I Didn't Really Need.  Buut Then.  Just two months later, my mother told me her boyfriend would come to stay with us.  I mean seriously- After two months? WHOORE.  Really.  she even later admitted that she was dating him before my parents got divorced.  But my mother, is a huge Bittch. I Don't Mean Normally.  She'll Try To Think Of Ways To Get Mad At Me.  When i stay at my dads house on the weekend, and before i went, i'd left the dishwasher dirty.  i came back, it was clean. Wasn't emptied.  and other jobs, like sweeping the floors, and cleaning, wont be done.  then im supposed to slave away on my own time.  every time i confront her, she says the same thing  "I Pay You For The Jobs. Remember (My Name goes here), Adults Are In First Class, Children Are The Third Class".  Really. It means that we are forced to work our lives away, while she sits back? i told my old counselor this, and she said it wasnt right.  i don't talk to a counselor Anymore.  i only did for about a month. Anyways, my mother makes me cry myself to sleep, because honestly, i have only a little bit of love for her.  One night, she called me a failure, And How she was dissapointed in me.  i want to live with my father, and have tried to, but she honestly tells him lies- and he'll join her side, human nature.  When they first got divorced, I Was allowed to chose who i lived with, and once i chose my dad, she cried her eyes out, saying i had to live with her.  i also don't mind her boyfriend, but she's making him her life, and i'm afraid if he leaves her, which he might, because of how she is, she might commit suicide.  she's the kind of person who would.. she's even practically said she has.  I Want to live with my dad, shes ruining my life, im going emo because of her..  How do i make this stop?  Sorry it's so long.

20090202162557AAsO8ZS	Family & Relationships;Friends	My friend claims she was raped. I don't really believe her.?	I have a friend named who claims she was raped . She dated this guy for 3 years and have now been broken up for a few months. She is now dating another guy. So she tells me she goes to a party one night and her ex boyfriend is there. She gets drunk and fools around with him. He goes further with it and wants sex she says no. He still forces himself on her and she starts to cry.      The next day Ashley calls to tell me what had happened. She doesn't seem upset about it but I decide to believe her. She tells me she hasn't told any of her friends and also declines to call the police or anything. I can still believe that as many rape victims don't want others to know what happened. I advise her to be honest with her boyfriend and tell him what happened, because she did cheat on him whether she was raped or not, they fooled around just before the rape. So she tells him and he gets really mad and breaks up with her.      So this is where I get really suspicious. As the days go by she doesn't even seem a little upset. I called the guy that raped her at her request to tell him to leave her alone. Yet, after me doing this she is starting to talk with the guy that raped her. She never took her myspace/facebook pictures down of her and the guy who raped her. She never unfriended him either on either of those sites as well. I asked her how she could talk to that guy after he raped her. She says well my boyfriend isn't going to take me back so I see no reason to not talk to him again. So basically she is friends with a guy that raped her like a week after it happened because her boyfriend that she cheated on won't take her back.      I find this too unbelievable and she is always in bizarre situations like this. I decided to end our friendship. Does this story sound like a lie to you? Was I right to end the friendship?

I need some designers or websites that sell really beautiful, princess type wedding dresses. The styles I like are these and anything similar     http://www.rebeccahatton.co.uk/mediac/40...     http://images.della.com/wc/fash/dressima...    Plain white is fine, but I do like beads or embroidery or even flowers in the dresses. I also like this color blue:  http://www.flickr.com/photos/polarunner/...    so if you have come across a dress with that color as an accent color and you know who designed it, that would be great

20090202163247AAgcJBn	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	I miss her so much i want to kill myself!?	A year and a half ago I met the absolute girl of my dreams while I was in Mexico. She had a bf at the time so nothing more than just heavy flirting developed but now she is single and we have a great chemistry and friendship. We talk on the phone and write each other now. She says she really wants to be in a relationship with me, but the distance is obviously a huge problem. Not to mention that her family likes me, but wouldn't want us together. I want to be with her but I don’t se how it could happen. I don't see how I could live in Mexico for financial reasons, but I would move there if necessary  if I could find a way. And it will be a while till she will be eligible to come here. Maybe sneak her in? What can I do to give this a chance? I will do next to anything to make it work out. Any good advice will be appreciated.

20090202163330AAIpCP6	Family & Relationships;Family	FAMILY SITUATION - NEED INPUT PLEASE!!?	Hello -      I am a mid-twenties female and I live at home b/c I cannot afford to live away from home (I am disabled).  I want to note that I do everything in this 2000 sq ft. house (vaccuum, mop, clean 3 bathrooms, grocery shopping, etc.).  My situation is this...      My father has his own office in the basement.  Me and my mother have ours upstairs.  I suggested to him that since my fish died I could move the aquarium out and he could move his computer up to our office - but instead he just bought a desk and moved his laptop - he still has his desktop computer and all hardware and main computer stuff downstairs.      Anyway, This upstairs office is communal.  It is a shared office.  My father will listen to CNN, and BBC online and Youtube things which I hate.  However, If I play Madonna or Celine while he is in the room he has a cow and starts to make my life hell.  It is like I have to listen to his garbage, but he won't give a little for me.        Also - my father snores terribly and most nights he will crash on the desk with his computer and snore and I will wake him up and tell him to "go to bed" and he will get mad at me and tell me "I am heartless".  My feeling is that "the desk is a desk and NOT a bed!  If you want to sleep that is what your bed is for!"        I know this is my folks place, but is this unreasonable of me to expect a little bit of respect from my father (RE: go to his bed to sleep so I don't have to listen to him snore.  And understand that this room is communal and  that everyone is going to listen to things that the other may not like)  I mean if my father really does not like this, I feel he should not have taken my suggestion to move into "Mine and my mothers office" and should just go back to his in the basement!        How many people agree with me???

20090202163835AAFuc0T	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I Punched A Boy In The Face?	I currently love this extremely shy, cute, and sweet girl. She acts..different with me, since I was forced to ask her out. She is even more shy to me, stumbles, nervous, gets serious when her friends mess with her about me. I'm in Eigth grade now..    Well, today, this asshole went up to her, and she wouldn't do his homework. If she didn't do it, he would get detention, but she didn't want to do it. So, after school, he had after school detention.    He called her very, mean, cruel, racist, and cruel things. He made fun of her asian heritage, with racist words like, "Chingy." and even decided to call her things like flat-chested, and a (insert word) sucker.    But, she started to cry when he called her "hairy legs.". I got angry, and went up to him, and I just bashed him between his nose and eyes.     The girl looked shocked, as did everyone else watching because the "Depressed Boy." (I take anti-depressants.) Slugged someone square in the face. When he got up, he started to cry, and told the teacher.    So, I have detention too, and his detention is extended. Sure, mine is unrightfully longer, but I don't care about that, I care about her. Did I do the right thing?

20090202164058AAB7t1T	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Can anyone give me an advice?	I am in 11th at my local HS. Lately, i've been doing really bad, at school. As well as, i have had a lot of absences. I am failing most of my classes, and am sure i might have an "NO CREDIT" in some of them. Anyways, the reason i have a lot of absences and failing the classes is because i really get sick at school. My stomach hurts, i feel like throwing up, and just feel really bad. I really do want to learn , and i do kind of like school. I'ts just this problem that i have that doesn't let me pay attention, or even feel confident. I was thinking of any other alternative to school, since i don't think i can take this much no more. I thought about homeschool, but my dad doesn't think its right, and he just doesn't understand. He thinks am making all this up, just because i don't want to go to school. Which am NOT! They are like that, they always think bad of me. Even, if am 3 min late to my house, they start wondering and thinking bad. I just wish they would understand. There is another program that you can buy of your HS diploma for like 400 bucks, and it is completely legal. But i dont know, if that would effect me later on. What could i do? i need some help? I Mean am really going to school for nothing because am failing and don't even pay attention. It's not because am dumb, it's just that a health-freak. Am not a bad kid, I don’t smoke, I don’t do drugs, I don’t even go out. But still my parents don’t hesitated to think wrong of me. I mean I have done some bad things, but am not like the other rebel kids. Am truly not, but they just don’t see that. Can anyone give me an advice?

20090202164241AASMlDg	Family & Relationships;Family	Adult Child with emotional problems living at home with parents?	My sister lives at home with my parents and has never lived on her own.  She works part time a few hours each day and does not pay rent or pay for anything.  She is 30 years old and has had emotional problems since she has been in her early 20's.  (not yet diagnosed because she won't go to the doctor, but I think it is anxiety related) My parents do everything for her including making meals and washing her clothes.  My sister has become a recluse and has no friends and no social life.  She has a dog that she looks after, her job and goes on facebook daily.  Both myself and another sister have tried to figure out what to do about this and even went to counseling ourselves.  We concluded that it would have to be our parents that would have to help my sister who lives at home, so that she can get better and move out on her own.  Since my parents are getting older, I am concerned that as they get older my sister will not be capable of living on her own, as she has no idea how to even pay bills.  Both my sister and I have expressed that our sister who lives at home needs help and have said this to my parents but my mom will not do anything.  If you confront my sister about anything she will cry and get emotional.  She barely speaks to anyone as it is, no even having conversations with my parents.  I also feel my mom will not do anything about this situation because she is using my sister as a buffer between herself and my dad who is an alcoholic.  My mom is enabling both my dad and sister in their problems.  So sorry this is long, but any advice, I am at a loss.

So my husband and Todd vauguely know eachother. After I hung up the phone, my husband was behaving really strange, quiet and sulky. He's aware that Todd is having relationship problems and that Todd always seeks my advice from a female perspective. Then my husband was sarcastically accusing Todd and i of flirting, making derrogatory comments that even though this was a sensible conversation, he "knows" that we don't talk like that when he's not around.

Well i'd be louder if i had more friends in that class, but since i have only one, i cant really be loud with one friend, and she's not really that talkative either. So i'm very quiet in that class. He's got many friends in that class and is very talkative and loud. I dont know if he still likes me. He doesnt seem to pay any more attention to me like before when i was mysterious and not in any of his classes. I'm not sure anymore. What do you think? What do you suggest?

20090202164747AAJSCcO	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Should I stay married to him, or go back to my ex? ?	I am 20 years old and married. Sometimes I actually regret marrying him. I am Bavarian (Bayern, Germany), he is Afghani. The only reason why I married him is because I fell in love with him and he should get to stay. I married him after 6 months. My parents, my friends and everybody say that I made a huge mistake. My husband is controlling me. He doesn't work and I work full time at the local pub. He still expects me to do all the housework. I live in a small village with 1200 inhabitants. He is the only foreigner there and I am scared that the rumors about he controlling me are spreading fast....... I am not sure if I should divorce him or not. Where should he live? He has no job. But I am tired of having him in my house. He is controlling me all the time and he is jealous because I have got three male best friends, Hans, Fritz and Otto. Me and Hans have been in a relationship before I met my husband. We have been very much on and off and it has been both Romeo/Juliet-romantic and just full of lust. I do love Hans and now we are just best friends. My husband refuses me to talk to my three male best friends and he barely allows me to go out alone. I have to meet them in secret. Three days ago, Hans gave me a love letter. He mentioned how beautiful I was, how sexy I was, how much he loved me and..... that he wanted to lie upon me with something hard inside me. Hans, Fritz and Otto do understand how he is treating me and they are always telling me I need to throw him out..... Should I let him live with me BUT divorce him and tell him I decide for myself?

Anyway my friend told here that I liked her and pretty much asked her out for me without my consent.  She now says that she has a boyfriend and I have no idea what to do next. I really think i love her and for all the right reasons.  How can I get her or what should I do??   Thanks a ton
20090202165011AAX5Mmz	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What does my ex want from me!!!!!!!!!!!?	Ok so its been about a week since me and my ex of 7 months had broken up... She is 17 and im 21, she broke up with me one day saying she needed space and not sure that she loved me anymore, so i gave her the space she wanted and then she ended up calling it all off. So I've been extremely upset because she seemed much more mature for her age and she ended up winning my trust and my love and I felt like we were going to be together for awhile. Now that all this has happened im trying to move on I had already told her i wasn't sure if i could just be friends like she wanted and that i needed time but now she keeps reeling me back in starting fights with me about stupid things like my friends removing her from their facebook and found out that i went out to some bar told me that at least she wasn't hooking up with random guys already because she heard some girls had been hitting on me... She gets mad at me when i don't text her or pick up her calls and yells at me that i don't care about her cause all my friends hate her and i make myself look like a saint... She's mentioned things before like I dont know how ill feel in a couple months and that maybe she want to come back and if it happens she hopes i wont be a typical guy and tell her to **** off.... I don't understand what she wants, she was the one that dumped me ARGH

20090202114008AAvOmlR	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Family problems...Should a couple still be together if the guy abuses his daughters?	Im having HUGE family problems. since I was a kid my father would come home drunk and hit me, my sister and my mother. He would yell at us for different reasons. Sometimes because of bad grades, other times because we had our cousins over to sleep, others because of normal fights with my mother, and he would always turn the problem into a bigger problem and just fight/yell/hit for hours. I'm 19, my sister is 15 and my mother is 54 (my father is 44).theyre not married but mom says hes the love of her life and that she doesnt want to be alone, plus she says we need him around for money too. Right now he lives somewhere else (although hes here from 10am-1am) and he is gonna move back in.We tried counseling, didnt help, and I have no money to live somewhere else, I have to pay for my studies. Please help, I need to know how to act too this, Im not happy, havent been happy for the last 2 years and my sister is the same.
20090202114053AAAKjjK	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Give me a hand sorting my life out, please?	Ok:   I used to self harm, but never told anyone, except recently my boyfriend. I got through this on my own, which was extremely hard, but I keep getting the urge to cut myself again.   My parents hardly ever let me go out of the house, except to college and to see my boyfriend sometimes - they say I should be staying in and working, and that I'm lazy, even though I'm a straight A student. Because of this I don't really have any friends. I'm really lonely and I just feel totally miserable.      Every day my mum tells me how rubbish I am... none of my 4 brothers and sisters ever get this, except me. I know this sounds a bit teenager-ish, but it's true (and they agree with me)   I've tried talking to my parents about how low I feel, but they either laugh or shout at me, or walk away. It really upsets me and I don't understand why they treat me like this.      My relationship with my boyfriend is starting to suffer. I've been with him over a year and a half, and I love him very much, but he gets frustrated with me being upset and crying sometimes, although he usually gives me a cuddle and says he understands.      I just truly don't know what to do...       I'm a 16 year old girl by the way... and I've never drunk too much or taken drugs or anything,... I just don't understand!      So... gimme a hand?   Thanks.

I was curious how common it is to not hear from your wedding guests again (presuming you thanked them for coming and all)?  You've attempted to stay in touch, but they didn't.  Or alternatively, if you've attended a friend/family member's wedding but they/you never stayed in touch.
20090202114330AAnghcZ	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Should I try and outdo the bride?	My sister is getting married on my sixteenth birthday and I'm being forced to go, AND my mother told me that I have to get a dress and that I have to pay for it with my own money, I have no choice. She also told me that I'm not getting presents, and I'm not allowed to even acknowledge that it's my birthday. I'm not even a bridesmaid and my whole family honestly does hate me, they've called me a fat whore to my face and have told me I don't belong in the family yet my mother insists that I should be glad to spend the day with people who actually love me. Should I just get totally dolled up and outdo her or should I dress like a total skank? I'm not sure that I want to just sit there and pretend it's not my sixteenth birthday and dress down like she wants me too because I'm prettier than her. She already has tried to tell me what to wear, and it sounded uber disgusting.

20090202115407AAWm08t	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Should I throw in the towel?	My husband and I moved to florida for him to attend  school after getting out of the Army. We are a blended family.  My oldest son has bipolar and add problems (I have two from my previous marriage 12 & 13). I have a son 20months old with my current husband.  He has three (two daughters and a son 15,14 and 12) with his ex-wife whom his mother (mother in law) totally adores because she has the only grandaughters and they seem to click.  Anyway, the summer we moved, my stepson came to live with us and was very manipulative and got physical with my other children.  He always put me down and never wanted to try anything that I had attempted to make us feel closer with.  Anyway, my mother in law called my husband saying that I was being mean to him and apparently twisted a whole bunch of stuff around.  The final blow came last oct. when it got physical again between the boys and my husband and I got into it where he pushed me with the baby in my arms.  I called the police and basically what it came down to was I left and drove with my three sons to california to live with my mother.  I have been here since and now have a good job with benefits everything is going better.  But I still miss my husband the way it used to be. He says he is going to move out here but wants to wait until he is done with school in 2010 but says he will transfer to phoenix and we can see eachother on the weekends.  Knowing now that his mother is telling him he is stupid to do that and he should have me move out to florida if he thinks the marriage is worth saving.     I don't want to move because I do not want to loose benefits for my kids and my oldest son wants nothing to do with my husband.  The stepson went back home with his mother for christmas for good because apparently now he hates his dad.  The only problem I have now is I am lonely and miss how it used to be. My older sons have been at their dads more often and I feel like I am losing them. What should I do?

20090202115626AAeqiQ7	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Why doesn't my boyfriend ever do anything romatic  we don't even have an anniversary?	My boyfriend and I have been together for a little over 4 years and we have a child together.  I wanted to know what exactly does it mean if he never really does anything special for anything.  He's done it in the past a couple of times but that's it.  We don't have an anniversary so nothing special there.  Birthdays I dread bad enough because my family is, well lets just say water is thicker than blood, but nothing special ever comes of it from him. So why doesn't he do anything or put effort towards a birthday, valentines, anything relative like that?
20090202115622AAPeYz9	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Army wife: Do I stay or try to make it work?	My husband and I have been married for a little over 6 years and have 2 beautiful kids, a 2 yr old son and our daughter turns 5 in less than 2 weeks. I knew he was unfaithful when I was pregnant with our son...he got caught and FINALLY owned up to it 2 years later, then on his second deployment in 2007, I found messages on myspace between him and a girl. There was evidence in the message that they knew each other and come to find out, he was not a virgin when we were together. He was my first and I thought he was mine, but this was not the case. So after 5 years of marriage, and mind you I had asked him if he had slept with someone before me (womans intuition) and he always said no...so I found out, he came home from Iraq, we pow-wowed had tears and worked through it.       Now its 2009 and its turning out to not be such a great year. I found a phone# on his phone with WAY too many texts to be army related. I noticed that he had been leaving earlier and coming home later, granted they are training for a 3rd deployment but still.      He left last night saying he was going to a sports bar on post to see the Super Bowl. After confiding with a friend my thoughts, we called the number on her phone and it went straight to voicemail with a girl's voice. I went to Rocky's and he wasn't there, called him and it sounded like he was in a bathroom...he lied...he was going to see her. It has been going on for a few weeks now, but after much debating and yelling he finally told me (after I basically pulled it out of him) that he slept with her...phone records show 2 and half hour long phone convos while he was in the field at night, and 2 minutes with me...      Of course he is sorry now, he says he wants to be with me...even fed me some BS line that he was going last night to end it with her...I love him, but my questions is...before when I made it work, I was told I was "a strong woman" for standing by my man....but at what point does that strong woman just become stupid?      I will never know if he is REALLY sorry, or sorry because he was caught...
20090202115655AAhbiic	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Question about child support payments made and proof?	I have a question concerning the payment of child support.  My husband pays child support to his ex-wife twice per month (this adds up to the lump monthly sum determined by the courts).  His divorce decree states that payments are to be made directly to the ex-wife.  He tried to have his wages garnished in order to ensure that there was a record of her receiving the payments; however, his employer never seemed to accomplish this, so he has paid her in the form of checks.  We keep all of the copies of the checks signed and deposited by her.        Two weeks ago, we gave her a check and she has yet to cash it.  I am concerned that she may claim that we never gave her the check.  My question is this: Other than having his wages garnished, is there any way that he can make a payment to her and have proof that the payment was made to her regardless of whether she cashes the check or not?
20090202115726AACgsYZ	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Help me! I have no idea what I'm going to do with my life!?	So I recently turned 21. I moved from Texas to California about 2 years ago. When I first moved here I attempted to go to college, but that didn't work out. It was good for the first two or three weeks. But then I started meeting new people, drinking everynight, and not being able to get up for class. It got to the point where I just dropped all my classes. So a year goes by and I don't associate with anyone anymore. I was deppressed as heck and felt like my life had no direction. A couple months later I found a fulltime job and got my own place. It was then when I met my girlfriend. She just turned everything right side up for me.  Things have been really good, and I was perfectly content and happy. Up untill recently things have been great, untill that is, my gf decides to move and go to a different school. She also admitts, she wants to see other people, but added on the side, " can I still see you sometime?" WTF!? To top it off she is moving in with her best friend, who recently broke up with her bf, and was sleeping in bed with another boy, while she was talking to me on the phone(****?). Not to mention Two guys already live in the apartment with them. Now I find myself thinking about my future, and I'm scared. I can't go back to school becuase I owe hella money for out of state tuition. I'm about to get fired from my job, becuase of low sales and the economy. I really want to persue music, but the odds of me being succesful are slim. Although, I am better off then I was this time last year, I'm still not. I feel like I'm back to square one. Once again my life has no direction. The person that I cared about the most just up and left. Makes me think about all the time we spent togther and how it had to of meant something. But by her doing this, it really didn't. What should I do?? please, any advice would help. I was considering the navy?? but kinda at as a last resort. I'm so clueless..

20090202120507AAzM3Fv	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Have you ever felt trapped in your marriage and don't know why?	Lately, even though I love my husband, I feel like I just want to get in my car and get away for a few days and be alone.  Sometimes I think if it wasn't for my three boys I would.  Even though my husband really hasn't give me much reason  to do such a thing, sometimes I feel neglected.  He is always on the internet from the time he comes home from work til he goes to bed at night which is sometimes not til 3:00 a.m.  A couple months ago I caught him looking at (what I felt) was inappropriate material on the internet.  I told him "so that's why you don't ever want to spend any time with me".  Since then he has stopped doing that but now I can't even go to sleep at night until he does because I don't trust him anymore.  He totally ignored me for it.  Now, I feel like nothing will ever comfort me and sometimes I wish I could just run away from it all.  Even though he is nice to me and the kids, sometimes I think if the apartment was on fire he would save the computer first.  What do you all think I should do?

So far today I have been told to move the wedding to where I'm living now or elope. I don't understand what happen.

20090202121445AAL2UfR	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Do you think my ex still cares?	Hello. FIrst off, me and my ex dated for 2 1/2 years, we did the whole long distance college thing for most of our time together. We had a great relationship. He is the most amazing guy that I know. We broke up because he wanted to "explore the waters". I understand that because I was his first girlfriend/love. Well he dated, and I dated. I am very close with his family still.  He keeps contact with me and we see each other and we both look at each other and smile. He got a new truck and came to my work with his friends, which he never does, and showed me it. He tries getting up with me to do "stuff".. I always wonder why he asks me and not other girls who he has been with. When we were together, whenever i got in his truck I always turned on the seat heater to warm up the seats cause they were leather and cold. When I met up with him recently (we have been broke up for a year and half) he had turned the heat on in my seat for me.. just little stuff like that that he still remembers.. I dont know.. but anyways he says that he doesnt want to be with me but why do all that he does for me to stay active in his life? I would drop everything I have to be with him again... I just want to know what others think if yall think he still has feelings.. I dont want to keep meeting up with him if he doesnt. Please help.

20090202122435AAH3Bep	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	I can't take this anymore!!!!?	I am 15 and am really stressed. I have so much homework and I just don't want to do it anymore. I am pretty smart, but this year I have just been failing test after test. I don't know what's wrong with me! Sometimes I tell myself it's just school and it's not going to ruin your life. My point of view on life is that you have a life enjoy it. Try to experience the life and have fun because your never going to be a teenager again and you have to make this the best time of your life. But then I know it's a little wrong to look at it that way, but sometimes  I just want to forget school and do what I love doing! Being an actress, being the crazy me, write stories on end, outgoing, funny, being the star on my basketball team, hanging out with friends, helping other people and volunteering and doing everything I love doing best. I am also very thankful for being really pretty and one of the most popular girls at school and I feel like I'm wasting that too...   I know I have to focus on school too, but I can't. I hate it and the grades just put me down and tell me to not care, so that study less and less test after test. My parents aren't any help because they don't believe in what I believe in. They'll just tell me and make me study more.    I do want to do well in school but I also want to have fun and I feel like school is taking over my teenage/having fun life.    What do I do? Please help!
20090202165224AAZ1i9q	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I HATE THAT I LOVE HIM...why is he letting me?	I told him I was catching feeling for him...we agreed to keep it casual.  It didn't work on my part so I told him I wanted to spend less time with him so I can get over these feelings (my past relationship was abusive and i'm just not ready for these feeling or commitment).  He said he wont push me away and our interaction has continued on the same path as before...    Does he WANT me to fall for him or something?  He's doing the bass akwards thing
20090202165244AAnSupV	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Guys and Ladies, Need your opinions on this.?	Well.. I've been talking to this guy for about a month now. He's really nice, sweet, funny, and smart. We have some things in common, which is always good to have when you're getting to know someone, but I'm not really sure what I should do. We've gone skating and went to the movies together, but with a group of friends.. Soo we haven't exactly been alone yet so we could actually hang out and get to know eachother more.. I'm not sure where exactly would be the best place to go to actually do that?      All opinions are welcome. thank you :)       Ps: I pretty much have this huge crush on him and he's told me he really likes me too. Sooo I'm not really sure where to go from here?    I'm not the type of girl that just rushes into relationships. I like things to work.
