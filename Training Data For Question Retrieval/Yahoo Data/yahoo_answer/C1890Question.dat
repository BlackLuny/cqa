Despite googlin' and finding maps of SE Asia, I can not seem to find one I can post on my website. When I go to drag it to my website it turns into a link.

Almost as quickly, it's gone. I don't have time to click on it or check what process it's related to. It happens regardless of whether I'm connected to the internet.      I have a HP printer installed, and it does something similiar; only instead of Toolbar, the HP logo appears on the Quick Launch near the clock. Maybe the Toolbar window is HP also?      I have Windows XP, is this related to Microsoft? Or a Virus? (I have rolledback my computer often, and remember this from before.) What do you think this is?

Sigo sin poder hacer q naveguen al mismo tiempo.Entre en la configuracion del modem-router y puse mi user y pass y tampoco funciono.Tambien probe deshabilitar DHCP y usar IP fijas.      Es logico q cuando se conecta una con el user y pass la otra no pueda conectarse con el mismo user y pass y es rechazada.      Es correcto poner el user y el pass de mi ISP en el modem-router? Ya no tendria q conectarme a travez del icono de mi conexion a internet?      Se q me esta faltando algun detalle de configuracion ya q la red funciona bien.      Saludos

After I choose the users, I click OK and it goes to the next page. It says 'WinRAR self-extracting archive.' It tells me to choose the Destination folder, and I choose My Documents. I'm not sure exactly what a Destination folder is. I click install, and a popup says "'C:/Documents and Settings/[my name]/My Documents' folder is not accessible." It also says in the box above right when this page shows up; "Cannot open C:/Documents and Settings/[my name]/My Documents/My Downloads/avg75free_467a1008.exe.

Le pc a donc une entrée pour connecter soit un cable d'antenne soit une petite antenne fournie avec le pc pour capter la tnt. Lorsque je lance l'application, le systeme me dit qu'il ne trouve pas de serveur (apres recherche bien sure). J'ai esseye avec l'antenne tnt fournie mais egalement avec mon cable d'antenne (relié au cable et non pas à une antenne rateau). Quelqu'un sait il ou le probleme se situe? Je dispose de 2 files de cable. 1 qui est analogique que j'ai relié au pc et un autre numerique qui passe par un decodeur que je laisse connecter à ma TV principale. Pour info, le cable analogique que j'ai utilisé sur mon pc permet de capter sans probleme les chaines cable et tnt sur une TV classique. Merci par avance

20081114062459AASnnDx	Computers & Internet;Computer Networking	Does anybody have experience with Bradford Network that runs wireless?	Two days ago my laptop stopped connecting to the internet, so I took it to tech support and it worked during midday. The next morning it didn't connect again, so I took it to tech support and they fixed it. Today I woke up and it isn't connecting again. I am so fustrated. It won't connect to my schools wireless. I don't think my universities tech people know how to fix problem, because there has to be an underlying problem as to why it never seems to work the next day. My roommate's computer works just fine, so I have no idea why it as started happening. If I were to take it to an outside source, such as Best Buy, would they be able to fix the problem? or is it more than likely a university problem?

20090309190425AA43iOq	Computers & Internet;Other - Computers	Hey, I really hate it that sometimes when I can be here or somewhere else and mistype badly enough, _________|?	suddenly my computer SHUTS DOWN WITHOUT WARNING! What the CRAP? I have one of those keyboards that has a shutdown key right "kitty corner" from the backspace key! So let's say I mean to be erasing something with the backspace key but instead go up and to the right a little too far and hit the shutdown key--well, since I wasn't prepared for it by copying and pasting and saving my stuff from a form like this one, I lose it all when my computer decides to shut down WITHOUT WARNING! If I were in a word processor or paint program, etc., I think the computer would ask me if I want to save my work before closing and shutting down. But not here!   IT'S SO FREAKIN' ANOYYYYINGGG!!!      How do I set my keyboard up so that pressing that key will either WARN me and give me an option to really go through with the shutdown or not, or just do nothing at all?      I've looked in the control panel already, and there is no option under Keyboards in there. So I have to dig deeper for a setting liket hat. Where is it?      If you want to say something complex like using the registry editor, you don't need to tell me the path to get there; just the path to get to which REGISTRY key(s) might be edited. Or if you want to tell me something about the computer management area, you don't need to tell me how to get there, either, but rather, just which paths and options to take once I'm in there.         Will you please come back a little later to see my responses to your answers? Thanks, if so.      Mike

Core 2 Duo @ 2.13 GHz   4GB RAM   Radeon HD4870 1 GIG   Vista home premium, 32-bit.   650W PSU      ok well, my computer is running slow... and i'm at my wit's end to figure out what it is...      i upgraded it about a month ago, it was 2 gigs ram, and a radeon x1950 pro extreme, and upgraded the 350W PSU to 650W (everything else the same) but i also bought a 17'' LCD monitor      before the upgrade my computer ran faster then it is now... so i really don't know what to do anymore.... it's most noticable in gaming... on my previous system loading a BF2 map took about half as long as it's taking now...      i've cleaned my computer, both with air duster on the components (yes heat sink included) and with spybot search and destroy, AVG, ccleaner, regseeker, and defragged. i've updated my page file size after upgrading my ram, i never have background programs running, all my computer starts with is what is needed to run the OS, i've fixed the 'heat issue' with the 4870 (the temps were within what the manufacturer said was safe, but still, those temps (50c idle and 80+ load) were worrisome. [they say the card is made to run at 90c or above])      my new PSU even is far more ventilated with a 120mm fan, i've watched temps, so it's not temps...      my computer is clean as can be, and still i'm experiencing alot of lag...      FIRST i need to know what my page file should be set at (total, i have two HDD's...just incase i put the wrong size)       next maybe someone can help me figure out what the problem is...

Mi spiego meglio,   se un amico sta chattando con me, e invita qualcuno alla conversazione senza prima chiedermi il consenzo:      a) il nuovo arrivato potrebbere leggere cose che ho scritto che non vorrei leggesse e soprattutto potrei non accorgermi della sua presenza e quindi continuare a scrivere.      b) nel caso si trattasse di una persona con la quale non voglio parlare, non ho la possibilità di escluderla dalla conversazione.      Quindi mi chiedevo se c'è un impostazione o qualunque metodo si voglia per impedire al mio conversante di invitare altri contatti alla conv..o per lo meno impostare una richiesta automatica di msn.      graziemille in anticipo.

After I gave her my address, she told me her boyfriend was in a gang and was in prison for murder. Do you think I should have given her my home address? I gave it to her thinking that I could trust her, but I'm not so sure anymore. I am very worried because I gave her this info. What do you think I should do?

I can print a nozzle check page directly from the printer but, when I try and print a document, nothing happens and the status changes to "Error - Printing". That's all I get to let me know something is wrong. Nothing comes up on the printer.       I deleted the printer and Windows isn't detecting it when I plug it in. I have to use the "Add a local printer" option and it finds it fine.       So - the printer is there. It works. Yet when I try to print a document, it gives me the error. Please help!

I have tried everything I can think of from updating drivers and re-installing the driver to trying to adjust the "switch" that contacts in the headphone jack...I can NOT figure out what is going on......any ideas???

20090309210727AAfX3yJ	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Other - Hardware	If I format my hard drive, will that stop using bad sectors?	So recently I accidentally dropped my laptop and I'm fairly sure my hard drive has a few scratched sectors on it and it fails SMART. I mainly use this laptop for testing unknown software so the amount of space on the hard drive really does not matter. The issue is I think a few key components of Windows existed on those sectors as Windows freezes every few minutes.      The question I had was if I format this hard drive and reinstall windows, will the reinstall of windows avoid the bad sectors? Will I be able to use the majority good sectors that are left on my machine?      I'm trying to avoid buying a new hard drive because this thing is out dated which is the reason for this question and I don't want to buy a new laptop if I don't have to.

I went to a small private school for a couple of years where everyone knows everyone (heck, when i was a junior my art class had sixth and seventh graders ...). this might not seem like a big deal, but since i was student council president last year and have been the one who does morning announcements for two years, many in the school know me. this isn't bad, but on facebook i've gotten friend requests from 5th,6th, - 11th graders. some of them aren't too bad but going to college next year i really want to sort of get away from that HS world and feel like since a majority of my friends are lower school kids ... it might be bit hard.      i feel like FB is turning into a popularity contest and people are just adding people who they know. i want to make a new one for college but don't know how to do it. i don't want to delete many of my 'friends' on there because they'd probably notice. id also hate to ignore friend requests because ive done that before and they keep requesting me and in a way it seems like you don't want anything to do with them. should i wait till the summer to make a new one and only add a few select friends? should i keep my current and make another with close friends? any advice?      thanks.

20090309203856AABngpW	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Desktops	Replacing faulty hard disc and setting up son desktop computer?	Hi, My sony vaio VGCRB34 desktop stopped working. When ever I start it I get the message to boot from the correct boot device. I sought online support from Sony and they took me through various diagnosis steps and concluded that the hard disc is faulty. They recomended to buy a new hard drive from them and use the recovery disc to bring back the computer to its previous working condition. My question is that if I just install a new hard drive and run the recovery disc, will it bring back the OS (Windows XP) back to my computer or should I have to buy the OS disc from Microsoft again? Is there any thing else for me to know to perform this task? I will really appreciate any informaion provided. Could someone please help me with the step by step procedure to make my computer working again?   Thanks in advaance   _Sm

(Again what brand).   * 4GB RAM (What brand and is it better to get 4 x 1GB, 2 x 2GB or 1 x 4GB?)   * A motherboard which supports HD?   * How many fans should my case have?   * How much power should my power unit supply?   * Anything else.
