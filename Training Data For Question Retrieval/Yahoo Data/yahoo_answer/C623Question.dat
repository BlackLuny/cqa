20090220081135AAIzfN1	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Best answer gets 10 points.please!!?	I just want you guys to tell me what you think. i dont want no rude or stupid answers. . but  when i was with my ex, i didnt have much, i just got out of school and i didnt have a job, or a car and anything you know. i was starting on my own and everything, but we were together for a year or so. and we were serious n happy. and he ended it because he wasnt ready for the commitment of how serious we got!. i was living with him... But now that were not together, i gained alot. and i am more independent now than i was when i was with him. and all i want is for him to be proud of me you know, not to get him back. but to be proud. i work for a big insurance company, i have a car and i have my own apartment, im living on my own. and i did it all by myself, i want him to be proud. do you think he is??. his family still love me and i stil see them occasionally. **** i even Get invited to family stuff. But I don’t go to them.. so his family obviously told him all the stuff I accomplished.   Do you think he’s proud?. Its not like we hate eachother, just stay away cause of the feelings.

20090220081508AAXh0Eg	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Have I Ever Really Been On A Date?	I have been married, it was sort of arranged....we did not date beforehand.    I have met a guy for coffee and a guy for a sandwich. (after my marriage was over, of course.) It was not planned to meet for a sandwich but he wanted to get him one and we stayed in the parking lot. (I declined food and drink myself.) I also did not stay long. Perhaps because one was a horn-dog and the other one was an idiot.
20090220081457AAWxeuH	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I am not afraid of interracial dating my parents hate it?	I don't happen to see a problem with it.

I happen to like a girl who is white, it doesn't even occur to me that she is she is beautiful, so why should her race matter?

20090220081503AAr2kgL	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is it ok for my girlfriend to text random guys who leave their number for her?	My girlfriend works at a restaurant and guys leave their numbers on the bill for her sometimes. She thinks it's funny and likes to keep the numbers in her little restaurant book. Awhile ago a kid left her his number and she told me about it and said he left her a really nice tip.   That night she text him back saying thank you for the nice tip. Than they text back and forth and she was asking his name and where he went to school. I got pretty upset about that and she does not understand why. She said she just wanted a friend. Am I just being jealous or is that a bit odd? If it is wrong how to I tell her about it?

20090220081834AAyqIgS	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I have a HUGE problem.. (long)?	i have been dating my current boyfriend for 4 months. i have an ex that i dated for a year but we broke up 7 months ago. i really thought i was over him, until about 2 weeks ago. i started thinking about him all the time & whenever i saw him at school all i wanted to do was go up & talk to him again. one day me & my ex didn't have school but my boyfriend's school did, so i texted him & told him to come over, because i wanted to tell him i was still in love with him. i was so happy we were friends again that i got scared to tell him because that might ruin our friendship. then i cheated on my boyfriend. :/ i felt terrible. my ex told me he wasn't going to be my friend if i kept dating my boyfriend, so i broke up with him. he still doesn't know i cheated. my ex came over again, & this time we acted just like we did when we dated, & he told me he liked me again. i'm not sure if he wants me back or not, but i know we can hang out & act like we're dating, which makes me feel alot better. i love him so much. but my other boyfriend was so nice to me, treated me right, & we never fought. he said he would wait forever for me to come back to him if i wanted to. he's in love with me, but i heart still belongs to my ex. me & my ex fought all the time, we were very jealous & didn't have such a good relationship. but if we tried it again, i think it would work this time. my ex is still "attached" to me, but he didn't mention love. he gets jealous of my boyfriend & every other guy i talk to, which i guess means he still cares? should i be with my ex that i love, or my other boyfriend that treats me right that's i don't love?

20090220081746AAGRKnU	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why Do I Miss Being Married So Much?	Was it because I was loved (supposedly), protected and got frequent sex?   I like being a housewife.

20090220081613AAtZ5xf	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My b/f promised a promise ring, 7 months later it's still not here?	My b/f told me he was going to buy me a promise ring. The first couple months he had a lot of speeding tickets and car payments so he couldn't get it. Then he got a new job and is making lots of money. He would say I will buy it for you next pay cheque, next pay cheque. This has gone on for around 2 months now and I told him that he let me down because he has had more than enough money for it and that I didn't want it now. I told him that I don't need a ring on my finger to know that he loves me but I feel very dissapointed and let down. He's let me down a lot to the point where I don't know if I could not be bitter at him anymore. Should I break up with him?

20090220082702AA8szga	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I make bad first impression when getting to know someone in a pub?	I go out frequently but do not pick girls that often, I usually mess it up when we start conversing.   .   Maybe it is the smile, or the way I do it, think too much, feel insecure. It is probably one of these or a combination.   .   I am nearly 30 and want to learn the skill of starting a conversation in similar settings (I have no problem in other e.g. work related situations) and not messing it up in the first place. I had a number of girlfriends who I met in other places than those with "direct" social interaction and everything worked fine. Even when someone introduces a girl to me, it is usually ok.   .   I studied some theory but I think thinking too much does not help. I believe it is the way I feel, comfort and realistic goals what I need.   .   Please tell me your opinion and any tips how to acquire the skill I mentioned. Simply "do" it does not work, as I feel insecure. And, I am a light drinker and do not use drugs (none believes me but is is true and I know it would help :) ).

20090220082144AA5HWva	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Lifelong crush, just broke up with his girlfriend, How do I comment on his facebook relationship change?	I've liked him and he's known since I was in 1st grade, he's 2 years older, I don't see him that often so we're not that close as friends. We were really close once, but that stopped after we didn't talk for about 3 years. He just broke up with his longtime girlfriend, and all his friends (who I don't know) are commenting on his "now single" thing on facebook. I never met his girlfriend, don't know her. I just want to comment on it as well to console him like a good friend, but I don't want him to get the wrong idea that I'm hitting on him or using it as an oppritunity to try to get him to go out with me or something. Like I said, I just want to tell him as a friend that I feel sorry for him. He knows that I don't have a boyfriend and thinks that I still like him (I do, but truthfully I like another guy more) So, should I comment or not?
20090220082148AAaUyea	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	He is acting very odd...what do I do in this situation?	My boyfriend and I moved to a new state together for his job about 8 months ago. He went home for three weeks in Jan. after he got laid off. Out of the blue he says he is going home again because his brother is going to prison and his debit card had been compromised. He bought a plane ticket without even asking me if I wanted to go or discussing it with me first.       I know he is a big boy and can do what he wants but it really hurt my feelings....plus he only got a one way ticket and wouldn't tell me when he would be back. Now, we love each other very much and have been togehter 1 1/2 years but I got very upset and yelled at him to just not call me while he was gone. And he hasn't called me! Nothing. Its been three days. What should I think? What should I do? At this point I don't know if he not calling because of what I said or because he just doesn't care to talk to me.

Im still talking to the guy  but i was just wondereing do you think he actually did have his cousin call or did someone elso do it just jokinly?

Decided to text this girl I just met who I thought might be interested in me (well I did her number). I think she responded pretty positively, some laughing (like after I addressed her as babe), and pretty quick responses. She never asked who I was so she obviously remembered. But I don't know if it's because she's interested or because she's just being friendly, so wanted to see what other women think (it's easier for me to make a move when I know the girl's interested). Thanks.

20090220084659AAQIWiO	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How to get boyfriend to give you a real spanking?	My boyfriend loves to spank me.   A little slap here, a little slap there.  And I love it!  I've told him that I have a spanking fetish, and he agrees and doesn't mind.  However, I've always wanted him to just put me over his knee and give me a real spanking...past the point where I'm telling him to stop.      He's afraid of hurting me.  He was spanked hard and often as a child...he is sooo afraid of hurting me...but he likes to spank me too.  Any ideas on how I can reassure him that it's alright, and I enjoy it?
20090220084742AAZWHNM	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I give up or be patient? About a guy.?	I found this guy on Myspace that I thought seemed cool, so I messaged him and we have been talking for about a month now, but haven't officially met in person.   The thing is that he left Cali, where we live, to go home to Michigan and stay with his mom so he could save some money in these rough times.  He says that he plans on coming back, but he is unsure of when that might be because of the money issues.  I asked if he really is gonna come back and he said yes, because all his stuff is here and his dog too.   I like him alot, but I dont know if I am wasting time waiting for him or if I should pursue someone else.  I still go out and meet other people, but I havent met anyone else that I like as much as him.  He calls and texts me all the time and makes me laugh so much.  Not to mention the fact that he is really hot too.  He expresses lots of interest in me too. What should I do?
20090220084836AA7aUNO	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Can anyone give me any advice on finding a nice boyfriend?	I have been trying to find the right boy for the past year now, and I have had no luck. I have had around 2 or 3 relationships with boys in the past year, but I didn't feel that any of them were the right ones.      Also, one of my disadvantages is that I'm quite shy, but when I get to know a lad I'm more confident around them.      I know what I like in a boy, I like them to be sweet, caring, protective and quite good looking, but their looks don't really matter.      Does anyone have any advice on ways of getting a really nice boy?

20090220085955AA4jStL	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I pursue him or will it just hurt me in the end? (please read)?	So my boyfriend and I have been seeing eachother for two months now. He's 17 and I'm 15 and we are CRAZY about eachother. We're always together and even though it's only been two months, I feel like he knows SO much more about me than anyone else and I feel sooo comfortable around him. I actually feel that I may love him. But....this whole relationship is somewhat temporary because he IS leaving for college at the end of the summer and it affects our relationship a lot. We plan on never having sex because he wouldn't want my first time to be with someone who I couldn't pursue for longer...and I wouldn't want that either...BUT he is someone that I would love to lose my virginity to. I feel like our relationship is going to have no problem lasting until he goes to college, but everyday the fact that he is gonna leave is becoming more and more realistic. I feel like I'm gonna be torn soooo much when he leaves, so for my own sake I don't know if I should get myself even more attached, but on the other hand, I really don't wanna miss out on him and this whole experience. I feel like him and the relationship in general could make me grow so much in the end. UGH! what do you think of all this???

He didnt approve or deny it till today when he approved it. We ended on awful terms bc I took him for granted. (I did NOT cheat) we broke up nearly a year and a half ago.

20090220092158AA5XUOZ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why do I seem to attract married men/men in relationships?	After a long term relationship, I've been single for a little over a year or so. I've gone on dates, have met a few nice guys, nothing serious.      BUT the guys that actually pursue me, talk to me daily, want to be intimate, have ALL had someone else in the picture. I dated someone for the last 6 months only to find out he had a girlfriend. Before that, same situation. I was seeing someone 4 months and saw him with his "girlfriend" at the bar. Recently, was asked out...and found out he was engaged. Even friends of mine ask me out after a break up--  probably just to take their mind off of the other girl. And I always get the same story when I confront them-- I'm so amazing, love hanging out with me, I deserve so much better, blah blah.      I don't understand. I'm nice, down to earth. I have morals, not a wild party girl. I'm against infidelity/shadiness. very open, honest. And am looking for the same things in a person. Why do I only seem to attract people that are already attached?

She takes hours to answer texts at times, and is terrible about making plans. Am i being crazy? Am i getting played? Should i play harder to get? Anything would help, this is driving me crazy.

20090220092032AAgAmc3	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do you back off of someone without making them lose interest?	Okay so I've been dating this girl for a couple of months and things seem to be going really well. Earlier this week her friend warned me not to "smother or bug her" but it came up in a way that leads me to believe the girl ive been dating complained about it. Her friend said go at her pace let her text me first, etc. My fear is that she will lose interest in me if I change my behavior and not communicate with her. I understand I could cool it a little bit, but I dont want to change everything thats been working for me so fast because as far as I knew she liked it when I would text her. If all of a sudden I'm more distant and stop texting her aren't I risking her losing interest? I just dont get it because she would always say she likes my texts and they make her day bettter and make her smile whenever she gets them (said that like a week ago multiple times) and now it seems like its annoying and I havent changed my behavior at all since we started dating.

20090220085231AAPZnTA	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why women insult decent folk like me?	I'm a 19 y/o guy.      I never kissed, hugged or held hands with a woman. I'm a virgin (I don't find it that a big deal), I'm not interested in sex or using women. Not bothered about that, I have better things to do like saving my money.      I've never had a girlfriend, hence the latter.      I rarely drink.      I've never taken drugs or smoked.      I've never been in a fight with anyone.      I rarely talk to any girls in my daily life (only on MSN but most tend to block me I dunno why?) LMAO the shallow buggers.      I'm a kind and caring sort of guy but I try not to show it.      I've been told I'm good looking. I dunno maybe for a joke f*ck knows?      I have a heart condition it isn't that bad; most girls who are interested in me tend to block me once I tell them for 6 or 7 months. LMAO even more shallow.      Well, I'm sort of introvert and a bit nerdy lol.      I listen to classical music, I know women hate that type of guy because he's 'gay' and 'boring'.      I sound innocent but I do stick up for myself.      Other than that, I rather money over women. Women don't have respect for themselves any more. Money buys you a house, car and food. Girlfriends don't :P      I'd rather money :P mmm... crisp bank notes and nice clean cheques. Women just waste your money.      I'm not having a women so she can have my money and then cheat, f*ck that!      These days women are a bunch of using sl*ts.

So sweet of her.... !!    hehehe      Anyways, I am trying very hard to cheer up, went to malaysia to chill. But can't get her out of my head. Sometimes it feels I am in love with her because a rejection never got me so upset. ( not that I get rejected a lot)       Please don't tell me that there are a lot of better girls out there. Something else. .......

20090220090503AAXXMpJ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Whats more important... my self esteem or letting my bf be addicted to porn and make me feel worse bout myslf?	OK... so, I have been with my bf for 8 months now. When I first met him I was 4 months pregnant with someone elses baby that was out of the picture. I was fine with porn in the beginning of our relationship but as time went on, I started to feel insecure about it. Sometimes when we argue we say alot of things to each other that we don't mean or just that we know will hurt the other person.. weird I know!  Anyways, so I had my son and soon after that we got into a arguement and well I was packing my stuff as I was leaving him and he said " you need help?" and I responded "NO.... Im a big girl" and his response to that was " You sure are a big girl"!!!!! Just because he knew I was insecure. Im not a big girl in any means but not small either.  That killed me and I can't seem to get that out of my head thinking that he actually meant it. A few weeks later I was going out with a friend and he was mad bc I was going out and told me "good luck finding anyone... your so ugly noone will want you"! So now not only did he say I was fat but ugly too! So, I am totally insecure about myself and I caught him looking at porn again!!! It made me feel even way more insecure at the point I just want to get fake boobs and become anorexic! I told him how I felt about it as he already "knew". And for some reason he acts like he totally understands how much it is hurting me. He even had me put a lock on his porn on demand with only a code I know bc he says he don't want to hurt me like that anymore. I feel kind of bad about it and feel like I am being selfish, controlling, and a horrible gf bc of it. I made him a promise that when I love myself again I won't care about him watching porn but until then it just hurts me beyond belief and I can't hardly look at myself the way I should. He told me that when I love myself he will watch it with me only. Should I feel bad about this bc I know all guys watch porn and I use to also as a woman. I just cant help but think of the things he said to me to hurt me and don't know how in the hell to get those out of my head bc he said he didn't mean them and it was just bc he knew I was insecure about myself and knew it would hurt me.       My question is this... should I feel bad about having low self esteem bc of the things he said to me to hurt me and feel bad about putting a lock on his tv when he asked me to..? I feel horrible and feel like I shouldnt feel insecure but HE MADE ME THIS WAY! I was always alittle insecure but nothing like I am NOW!
20090220090755AAJwO3m	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I'm TERRIBLE at reading signs from girls, can you help me?	This girl that I know is a friend of a friend. I don't formerly hang out with her. But when I see her we have good conversation, flirt, etc. The thing is that she's subtly touching me everytime I am near her. Things include.      -she noticed I worked out and insisted on feeling my back   -I walked by her one time and before we passed she put her hand and grazed my stomach, when I looked back she looked at me and smiled.   -we were at a bar for a Valentine's Event our other friend hosted (we didn't drink) and she grabbed my hand to dance, and after that she grabbed my hand because she wanted to take pictures with me in the photo booth.   -everytime she looks at me she smiles.      I know her enough to know that this isn't common behavior (probably hung out as a group about 10 times). Is she into me? What are signs you girls show that you like a guy?

20090220090754AAqnUQw	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How often do you give your man money?	My boyfriend of a year and a half has been in my pockets like crazy. He does sales and b/c of the economy his funds are really low. So being his woman I feel it is necessary to keep him on his feet. I don't make much money and he asks me for everything and if I say no to anything he catches a bitche fit. I pay for his canabis(which he refuses to conserve), cigarettes (which I've asked him not to smoke around me many times but he doesn't listen), I pay $1000 in bills a month, fill both our gas tanks. etc.      So now his car stereo broke and I helped him buy a new one and he is going to pay me back. But he asked me for $50 to get it installed.       I'm tired of living check to check and I'm tryna save so now he calls me stingy. He's a big spender and I'm not so idk what to do.      He says he hates being told no. It makes me feel like I have no choice but to give him the money. I told him I have to set boundries b/c if I didnt he could walk all over me. He got mad and said I don't trust him. :(      I've never been in a situation like this please help!
20090220091510AANHIgL	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is it rude that he didn't answer this text message?	A guy who I met when I ran with the track team last fall has been flirty with me over msn. He invited me to go to one of the track dinners on St-Valentines (even though I haven't really run with the group in a while) and we talked together the entire evening. He's been flirty-texting me a lot during the week too.      Well tonight we were supposed to meet for the first time alone, and play pool. Two days ago though, I got food poisoning, and it really set me back in my school work. Yesterday he texted me a greeting, and I wrote him back that I was sick and probably wouldn't be able to go out the next night (which is tonight). He never answered me all day!!!      Today, just to make sure he got the message, I sent him a text telling him that I am still sick, and that I definitely won't be able to make it, but that I am looking forward to the next time.      No answer....      Why?      He's 22, I'm 20.      Is this rude? Should I say something about it? I know it's probably part of the whole 'game'... but..???      What should I make of this. I hope we can retake our date on another night.
20090220091531AAlXecY	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I have a jealous boyfriend and we're in a long distance relationship. How can I make this work?!?	I have been dating my boyfriend for over seven months now.  I'm in college and he's working full time back home.  I go to school, work out on occasion, and stay at my apartment.  I never go out and never hang out with friends.  I do this because he has trust issues and insecurity issues due to his former relationships.  I get very lonely and feel somewhat socially alienated from my friends.  But I love my boyfriend and I want to do whatever it takes for him to get over these issues of his so we can have a wonderful relationship.  I see him every weekend.  It mostly involves me going to see him.  When we're together, everything is AMAZING!... But when i'm at school and he's at work during the week, he gets jealous or upset every time I say I need to work out.  He thinks the trainer will feel on me and flirt with me, which he doesn't!  He constantly asks who i'm with, when i'm with nobody!... I could be buying books for school or just getting groceries.  He has to know where i go at all times.  If i don't update him, i get in trouble.  I fully and completely trust him and he says he trusts me but I don't get that vibe sometimes.  We get in a fight about once a week over his issues.  He constantly compares what I do to his past relationships.  He thinks if something I do is even remotely close to something that let to a breakup in his past relationship, that what is happening between me and him is leading to the exact same thing!... I'd never hurt him.  I want to be with him for the rest of my life.  I need help.  I do anything and everything I can to have him feel that i'd never do anything to hurt our relationship, but somehow he finds ways to make me feel like i'm not the best girlfriend that i could be.  Please don't get the idea that he's a bad boyfriend by any means.  He is a wonderful boyfriend!  He never raises his voice at me, always opens every single door for me, drives up to see me and surprises me with flowers, writes me poems, and is always affectionate towards me.  He's just jealous and insecure.  PLEASE HELP!!!

20090220091608AAWEs34	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What the hell is wrong with me?	I don't know what the hell is wrong with me.  I have the sweetest, coolest, girlfriend.  We have a blast together.  We laugh together.  But most importantly, there's no drama.  She's just a very cool person, and I care about her a lot.      However, I still think about my ex-girlfriend quite a bit.  I think about her even though she's mean, narcissistic, doesn't appreciate anything, and didn't make me feel good about myself because she was such a miserable person that felt the need to make everyone else around her suffer.  Why am I such an idiot.  Why do I still have feelings for such a negative person who is obviously no good for me, while I am fortunate enough to have someone who obviously is right for me?  Any suggestions.  I don't wanna be one of these morons who always seems to do things that are gonna be bad for me, and throw away good things.

20090220091656AAgeXUA	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Women: If this happened to you --  how would you react?	This situation happened to me recently, so I'd like to know your thoughts if this was role reversed:      Say you recently met a guy online and started talking to him for months and months.  You develop a strong liking for him and you decide to meet him to which he tells you the picture that he posted is not of him and shows you his real picture which is less attractive.      My argument is: logically most women at this point would stop communications and if asked why they would say "I don't like liars"  but the truth of the matter is it's purely your loss of attraction for them because they're not attractive than their fake photo.  It just seems that the "lie" is more of a convenient excuse to cover up the truth.  Think about it this way, if you liked the guy so much and you loved everything about him; once you find out his one flaw (fake photo), why would you forget about all the other things about him that made him great and just focus on that one flaw and assume that everything about him is true NOT just the photo.  In this case you never TRULY liked him for who he was and using this flaw would make the perfect excuse to leave because truly you are not attracted to his looks.      This happened to me but the girl is the one that was fake.  I ended up liking her so much it didn't matter if the picture was fake.  I stuck with her, it was the best decision I made.
20090220091820AALZ4PM	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I stay with my boyfriend and who do I believe?	My bf and i have been together for a 1 yr and 8 months. Last night I found out that when one of his friends, thats a girl, came over to his house to say goodbye before going back to college. He hugged her goodbye and then they ended up kissing. My bf's side of the story is that she kissed him and he said what are you doing, I have a gf? and she said sorry and left. But I asked the girl he kissed and she said it was mutual and she is the one who said wait, don't you have a gf? My boyfriend has been literally on his knees begging me not to break up with him and swears he is telling the truth and that he loves me and wants to have a future with me. But before he finally confessed to kissing her after he denied it for like an hour. Recently, my boyfriend and I have been the best we have ever been in our relationship. What do I do? Advice!

20090220092009AAPU0Za	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Whats wrong with him?	So...Me and my boyfriend of almost 3 years is leaving, me and him have had a ROCKY road, but have managed to make it this far. We have broken up in that time for a period of 8 months realized we still cared for each other, got close again and got back together. Its been 10 months since then.       He is leaving to Costa Rica for 3 months and then traveling to Peru and Panama for another 2 months, on a surf extravaganza.       He has had this planned since August of 2008.    We both agreed that when he leaves we are ending the relationship, he doesn’t want me waiting for him and I don’t want to wait/put my life on hold. We both don’t know what’s going to happen when he gets back. if we will be together or not.       He leaves the 28th of this month (February)   This past month has been horrible.    All of the sudden he is angry at me for everything. And I mean my very existence in his life makes him angry.    Things like calling to say goodnight, he thinks I’m checking up on him,    Putting a bowl away in the wrong place, makes me disrespectful.       I was having a trouble with my boss, who happens to be his mother, he was helping both of us cope with the defining lines in the working relationship and then gets mad at me like he’s piggy backing me and how I am not cooperating and basically put the whole issue on me.       Me and him have had the same argument many times. He always thinks I’m Naive or depend on him. Can’t live without him. He thinks he’s responsible for my happieness. etc      Just this last Tues he invited me to hang out with a group of mutual friends. (Well call this the JLo’s)   He had left to go play the drums at another friends house (Well call him Mac) and was going to come back.    Me and Jlo’s were hungry and thinking about ordering a pizza, so I called my boyfriend to see what he wanted to eat. After I got his order he said he was on his way back and was leaving Mac’s (who lives down the street from his house), and was going home to change real quick.       Well 45 minutes later everyone was asking me where my Boyfriend was, so I texted him. (Now the Jlo’s house and my boyfriends house is literally a 3 minute drive at the most)   He never responded I waited 10 minutes and called him, he picked up and said im outside right now ill be there in a second.       He came in and was acting funny to me. I had one of my best friend 9 month old baby sleeping on me and I was playing a game on my cell phone and my boyfriend asked me what I was doing “I said playing a game” he told me “Your boring”. I let this slide bc I wasn’t about to act like a 10 year old.       Later on in the night we were going to take the party to another persons house. I had been talking to one of the girls that lives there all night about it.    My boyfriend decided he wanted to go and came up to me to tell me he was going to go up ti the other party and I said cool I’ve been talking to so and so about it but I cant stay the night bc I have to work tomorrow so I’m going to drive. He basically got super upset at me and said he didn’t want me to go and that’s not what he was hinting at,        Well the night ended up this dramatic thing.    He says I’m ruining his last few days here   I’m smothering him   Basically me and my existence sucks      We haven’t spoken since.    We aren’t together anymore   I see him every day due to work.      Then yesterday he came in the office and ignored me   When he left he said a general goodbye to everyone. And I didn’t say anything back   He texted me saying “that goodbye was directed at you to”   I said “sorry….Bye, it just didn’t feel natural”      10 minutes later I called him thinking maybe he was ready to say sorry and talk about what happened but instead he cut me off and said that he  didn’t want to talk, no conclusion was going to be made of it. He said he doesn’t like feeling angry   I just said ok well when you’re ready to talk you can call me.       And left it at that…      I didn’t want to say goodbye to him this way. He wanted me to come down and visit him in Costa Rica and talked so excited about keeping in touch with me and so on.    All the sudden it’s a complete 180, he doesn’t speak to me he’s angry at everything I do or say. And every time I’ve tried to conform to him and he just finds something else to attack at. AND it all is petty stuff. I just wanted to say goodbye on a happy note in the hopes that things will be comfortable when he gets back and while he’s gone and just all these things.    I don’t care that we broke up. It was going to happen anyways in a week and I was prepared for it. It just hurts that he’s choosing to make things this way.       I planned a huge goodbye party for him tomorrow and everyone tells me to go anyways, and to say goodbye to him the way I wanted to and let him be the way he wants.    I feel like he is trying to push me away. And when we had are big blow up I mentioned it to him because I can’t find any other reason for him to be angry at me all the time.    He just said ”you just ma

20090220095441AALK2BP	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why Why Why do women take the....?	ABUSE????       You ask if you should leave your abusive partner....he hits you...verbally abusive....emotionally abusive. Yet you come in this public Q&A website, and you actually ASK if you should leave this person. THEN, someone answers "You really have to even ask this question?" And then you report their answer.       Ladies - its common sense, if a man is being any type/form of abuse towards you....LEAVE HIM!!! He doesn't love you, he WON'T CHANGE, and IT WILL NOT get better!!!! What will it take for you women to understand that???? When you die?? Or get physically scared??? Have you never watched Oprah with the abused women on there?? Get some friggin self esteem, maybe a make over and go find a better man that is going to treat you like the Princess you deserve to be!!!! STOP BEING SO STUPID!!!!!! And I know some people are going to answer, "Well, if shes a biat*ch then she deserves it......No NO NO....no one deserves to get abused, in any way.       Bottom line - men or women - if you are not happy in your relationship for any reason, get out. Life is way too short to waste your time on people that don't love you and don't make you happy in some way.

20090220095108AA2V9cW	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Guys...Please answer? I need more than 2 opinions...?	Back round information: This guy and I are both 17 and juniors in high school. We are pretty close friends.      Story: I was standing with my group of friends (before the bell rang to go to our first class of the day) talking and what not. And this guy and his friends were standing maybe 3 and a half meters away from us. And this guy was leaning against a wall facing away from us. Every now and then he would turn around and look at our group. (I'm not sure but I think he was looking at me). And, when he did this I looked him in the eyes a couple of times and he looked away when he caught my eye. Then my group and I had to walk by to go to class and when we did I saw out of the corner of my eye that the whole entire group (not an exaggeration) was staring at us. And when I was a foot in front of him I got this creepy eerie feeling that they or someone from the group was staring at me. There were only 2 girls in our group that day and one he is not interested in (he did say this). And I'm the only other girl. Then when I was walking to my second class of the day (He is in it) I sat down and he stared at me off and on for a while. It's really weird as well because he's not really the type that really stares at girls he likes.      Also when he gets the chance to look down my shirt he looks away...(Which is weirds because, not to sound slutty, most guys like my boobs).      What is going on with him?   He never stares at me like he did today...

20090220100713AAziMYC	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I pursue him or will it just hurt me in the end? (please read)?	So my boyfriend and I have been seeing eachother for two months now. He's 17 and I'm 15 and we are CRAZY about eachother. We're always together and even though it's only been two months, I feel like he knows SO much more about me than anyone else and I feel sooo comfortable around him. I actually feel that I may love him. But....this whole relationship is somewhat temporary because he IS leaving for college at the end of the summer and it affects our relationship a lot. We plan on never having sex because he wouldn't want my first time to be with someone who I couldn't pursue for longer...and I wouldn't want that either...BUT he is someone that I would love to lose my virginity to. I feel like our relationship is going to have no problem lasting until he goes to college, but everyday the fact that he is gonna leave is becoming more and more realistic. I feel like I'm gonna be torn soooo much when he leaves, so for my own sake I don't know if I should get myself even more attached, but on the other hand, I really don't wanna miss out on him and this whole experience. I feel like him and the relationship in general could make me grow so much in the end. UGH! what do you think of all this???

We are both 17,& a few months ago without telling me one of my friends ask one of her friends who she likes and her friend said sum guy from another school, then he asked another friend and the friend said she likes no one and is waiting for that special guy, which now makes no sense to me and im confused.       (Earlier this year she told me to write I luv her in my msn nick cause it would be funny:S then the she did the same for hers. ppl started asking us if were dating then she said she when I asked her why she removed her nick she said because she was tired of people asking if we were dating:S, On facebook she left a message on facebook and had bro in it.      We started talking less after prom & for A week in the summer she had a Bf but I didnt really think she liked him that much because her msn name was the same while his was he loved her and less than a week after she broke up with him.This summer we didn't really talk until she left me a message on facebook telling"Wats Up Long Lost Home Dog I miss U with Smily Faces ,      Recently She started saying Hi to me less but in gym I see her looking at me alot, .and recently when she says hi she makes her best friend say it to, also if she sees me talking with sum1 she will wait till Im done and she will say she woulda said hi earlier but didnt want to interpt me,& when I walk bye her class she will call me and wave with her cute smile:).       *I was at my bustop 2day and when she saw me she yelled my name so then I went to go talk 2 her , she then asked me if I get annoyed that she says Hi everytime she sees me and I said no its np. And when I got on the bus her & her best friend saved me a seat.

20090220103405AAoGAc5	Family & Relationships;Family	Food allergies and Inlaws...was I wrong?	Hello,   To start I have severe nut allergies...I can't be around them at all. My fiance and I both avoid it because if he eats something then kisses me, I could have a reaction.       So on to the problem... My mother in law doesn't like me because I am takeing her son away. Her words, not my own.      We were invited to a family dinner, and cards at my inlaws. She is not very good with allergy friendly cooking and no matter how much I try to educate her, she has almost killed me 8 times. My fiance called and told her that we would be there for cards after they ate because of the lack of understanding with my allergies. She is blaming me, and she told to my fiance to reconsider what he'll be giving up. He just wants to keep me safe.      Now I feel guilty that we won't be there, but if she cooks anything with nut byproduct in it, I get rashy and my throat swells.      She's blaming me for him not being there to eat. Am I in the wrong here? I didn't want to be rude or anything, my life is on the line.   Based on your question, we think it

20090220094426AABZHyQ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Can we still be friends after all of this?	My ex and I were together for about 6 months on and off. It gets complicated but basically he didnt want to be tied down in a relationship so he broke up with me. He insisted that we remain friends because he didnt want to lose me and we hung out a few times since the break up. He would make plans for us to have dinner and stuff but then never called and went to go party. I finally had enough and whenever he called or texted after that, I didnt reply. A month later, I saw him and he asked why I was ignoring him and I said I have been really busy. This was the last time I talked to him, over a month ago. I think I am pretty much over him (I have been kissing this other guy haha but he is a manwhore so it will go nowhere) but I have really missed his company and now I feel that ignoring him was a mistake and that he is still immature but maybe I should be patient with him. He was my first so I dont want him to simply disappear out of my life. I know his schedule and I want to "accidently" bump into him and see if he will talk to me and if he still wants to be friends. Is this a good idea?
20090220101822AABtZ0e	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	NOW he's begging for me to come back!?	My ex husband basically saw an opportunity with his ex while we were married. He started calling her, and told me he didn't love me anymore. Long story short, we were officially divorced on Jan 7, 2009. We have joint custody of our 19 month old son, and now I have my own apartment. I do feel better and I can enjoy my son more these days.    His ex came into town a couple weeks ago, and suddenly he is begging for me to be with him again. Apparently, they are incompatible. She is still at his apartment, but supposedly has been sleeping on an air mattress and is leaving this weekend.   I feel like the damage has already been done and I don't love him anymore. He's been texting me like crazy telling me I'm the one and he screwed up and he's going to die trying to earn my love again. What the hell? What do you think?

20090220100739AA5P8lW	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	SOMEONE ANSWER MY QUESTION :(?	A guy I have been casually dating for a long while now has asked me several times to meet my mother. She comes to visit me a few times during the year since both of her kids are now away at college. The other times he has said this, he never made plans to meet her. I let it go because we're not exclusive, and it was his idea in the first place.      She's here again, and this time he's been insistent, saying he really wants to meet her (I don't really know why.)      Last night he actually made plans though, and asked to come over today. I invited him for dinner with us and he agreed. Then I let him know what time, because we still had to pick up my sister from the bus station later tonight. We were texting, so to that message he never replied back.         It's almost one o'clock now, and he still hasn't responded or said anything about tonight, but he's one of those guys that doesn't have to keep confirming plans, if he's said he's coming, he always comes. But I'm still worried.         Could he be flaking? Or is it still early enough for him to text me back? I don't want to text him again and annoy him, considering this wasn't really my idea in the first place.      Also....why would a guy you're casually dating insist on meeting your mother?      Should I even bother saying anything if he doesn't come?

I'd never actually slept with him back then. But I had had feelings for him when he was with his last girlfriend and I thought they had dissipated until low-and-behold we became friends with benefits unexpectedly (it wasn't discussed beforehand, just happened and continued to do so..). The feelings have come back now because we've been seeing each other a lot more than usual and I just think he's a great guy.   It's not a good feeling either. We know a lot of the same people and none of them know and I just feel a bit like a dirty little secret.  We never even discuss things, except sometimes he drops in a compliment like "You've got a great body". Should I break this off and if yes, how could I go about it without screwing up the friendship because we are really good friends.

20090220093402AASpTQ7	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What do you think about dating a guy older than you?	Ok, I'm about 5 months from being 18 and I'm not the type to talk to guys like that or definitiely talk to guys who are older than me.However, I talked to this guy who is 22. He's wonderful, but I cant see him like I would like to. We've gone out about 2 times and it was wonderful. He's successful for his age, and he always showers me with affection. If I tell anyone about him(especially his age), the first thing their going to say is that he wants me only for sex. We didnt even kiss on our first date!      But anyways, I dont know what will happen when I do turn 18. I feel like moving in with him. But I know thats probably not a smart idea, for I dont have a car yet.        On top of this my dad knows of this guy, but doesnt know we're talking.   That day will be extremely awkard. He will probably disapprove or be disappointed that I never told him. I dont like lying to my father but I'm just following my heart.      Anywho, how do you feel about older men? We already say that we love each other.       He has stopped smoking and doesnt even go out to the club with his friends just for me. I didnt even ask for that.       The only thing I dont like about him is that he tends to be really emotional and clingy to me(like he wants to talk at 2 am in the morning when I have to wake up for school at 5 am). and is kinda has some control issues....is that normal at all?

Well there's a girl who i used to go to primary school with, and in like year 4 or 5 (cant remember) she asked me out. becos i was only young i said no. which turns out is my biggest regret ever. we went to separate high schools, and now im in college and shes at sixth form at my old high school. i found her on facebook, and iv been talking to her alot and i realised i really really like her, but i dont want to ask her out in case she says no, its not the fear of getting rejected i just dont want things between me and her to be awkward and dont wanna lose her as a friend. Im not sure but i THINK she likes me, the other day we had a chat for like 2 hours untill midnight, she askes about how im doing and about me and my family and everything, so..does she like me?
20090220102112AA84mBe	Family & Relationships;Family	How can I tell my mother this?	My mother is planning on moving to Kansas because she found a house there fairly cheap and is going to buy it. I already know she wouldn't be mad at me for wanting to stay where I am now, but I just can't seem to find a way to tell her. She just helped me get a truck and has helped me numerous times, but she also has been saying she has been wanting me to move out for a while now, And i have also had it with my little brother being as he won't listen to me or anything. So how can I tell her that I'm staying? And normally I'm straight to the point when I tell anyone something, but I just can't seem to find the words or the right time to tell her.

20090220101333AAD551R	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is it easier for girls to get with girls then it is for guys to get with girls?	I know a girl who's bi. She told me she has social anxiety but it seems like she has no problem getting with other girls. One time at a resteraunt I saw her walk up to a random girl she liked and got her number in five minutes.  This makes me guess that it's easier for women to get girls to give it up to them. Is this true?

I really like this girl that is one year older than me and we go to separate schools. The only way that I can talk to her a lot is on MSN Messenger. However, the problem is that I do not talk to her a lot because we never get past:      Me: Hey   Her: Hey   Me: Whats up   Her: Nothin much you?   Me: Nothin really      and thats pretty much it.

20090220102301AAcrJjh	Family & Relationships;Friends	I be myself,I don't try and fit in, is that a good thing?	I be myself,i don't try and fit in to things like other girls do at my school.Theres this one club called Catty Cats and it's these girls who wear pink short short skirts and white beaters,they told me i had to dress like them in order to be in it.They are very popular,but i don't worry about popularity.My friend said we should join it,but i told her no thankyou im not interested,so she quit talking to me and joined Catty Cats.Ever since then she's been different.Dressing like them ,talking like them, and acting like them.One day i was sitting at lunch with my other friends and they came up to me and said "you should have joined,we don't see why you wouldn't you still can if you want" and i told them no thanks I find being my own expressive way more better than acting the same.       Should i have done that?was it worth losing a friend for? I actually thought of making a club about being different "Club Differ" were everyone is anyone! should i make it?
20090220094453AAHQteT	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why is my girlfriend acting like this (10 points for best answer)?	Alright me and my girlfriend are young I'm 19 and shes 16 but we are really close, closer then most couples are at that age. Meaning I get a long with her family and all that good stuff and its getting serious. So we love each other and we tell each other all the time, she constantly talks about our future together.      Last night went great we had a really good cute conversation, and ever since then everything has weird since the morning. First off we made plans last night for her to come over, she was going to come over and we were probably going to have sex and she would never pass on that chance usually. But anyway this is what happened.      This morning I don't get text from her first thing like I usually do. She usually texts me before school before 8am. And didn't hear anything from her, so I ended up texting her around 10:30, didn't end up hearing from her until after 11 where it was almost like she was talking to me differently.      Instead of being cute like she usually is and say I miss you so much, she just said miss ya. Then we were just talking about whatever over text and shes like oh I'm going to a party tonight with my girls what are you doing. And I had plans with her but I didn't want look like an idiot and say I thought we were doing something. So I said I don't know I guess I will go to the bar almost like I tried to throw it her face considering she can't go to one.      And then she started saying stuff like that if you go out don't act stupid. When you do... you get me mad and I want to break up with you. Then I'm telling her yea I'm not going to mess around don't worry and shes like good boy or else. And I told her I don't want to lose you so I wouldn't put you through that. Told her I loved her and she has not responded to me in like the last 40 minutes.      Well actually as I just finished typing this she did send me a message saying I love you. But there is still kind of an issue here in my opinion.

20090220095214AAnSvLV	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I move on? Advice please...?	Me and my current partner keep fighting about the same issues. We can't seem to compromise on anything. When there is something that bothers me he seems to find away to twist it and make it look like he's right and i am wrong. He tells me that he isn't obligated to take me out for dinners and movies. He says he also isn't obligated to call me everyday if he doesn't feel like it. He continuously compares me to his "guy friends and girl friends", saying that I'm the only person that expects things from him and that he is young. In last nights argument he said that we should take a few days to ourselves. He basically implied that he is waiting for me to give in. All I ask is that he if makes plans with me, he keeps them and doesn't go hang out with his friends instead. Or if he says he is going to call me in 20 mins he does. Its so simple but yet he tries to make it look like i'm expecting more than the obvious. I love him but I'm not sure if i can live up to his standards. What should I do? Advice Please.

So the night before Valentine's day, my boyfriend and I were doing laundry together in the laundry room of our apartment building, where there are multiple shared washers and dryers. We had just come back from dinner and as part of his valentine's day to me, he had cleaned the entire apartment.As we were putting clothes in the dryer, I pulled out a girl's camisole that was definitely not mine. We were both speechless, and I just threw it away and walked upstairs, not knowing what to say. We are together almost all of the time, so I really want to believe him when he says he has no idea where it came from. Nonetheless, it was a horrifying discovery. I have tried to give him the benefit of the doubt and not dwell on it, but I can't get it out of my head. I can't prove that he did anything, but I can't prove that he didn't either. HELP!

But I know if he goes alone, he won't let what happens there, stay there. I just want to know how to let him know how I feel without seeming closed minded.

20090220102342AAHD9b4	Family & Relationships;Family	Why won't he do things with my family?	Iv'e been going out with my boyfriend since November. I am falling really hard for him and I think he is for me too. He invites me to do things with his family all of the time. I am a very shy person but I really like him so i always went when he invited. I went to their christmas dinner, spent new yrs with him, and his moms dinner with his cousins over. I invited him over my house to meet my extended family twice. But each time he made an excuse. One of the times it may have been a good excuse but the other he said he had "band practice" which they practice EVERY DAY so if he really wanted to he could have called off and came. I believe im important enough. Why do you think he is making excuses? Also, another time i invited him to come out to eat with my family and he made some excuses including saying "well i dont want to keep them waiting, bcuz it might take a while for me to come....u should go without me" but i told him it was too early to go out to eat now anyway, and he agreed to come.    My question is why does he make these excuses? What is the reason he does  not want to come spend time with my family? Is he shy? I can't see that, because i am very shy and he is more outgoing than i am and i still go to his family stuff. Plus im going to myrtle beach with his family this summer. Why wont he do things with mine? Thanks.

Now heres the thing his mother sends my social my id and birth certificate back in the mail. BUT WHERE IS OUR MARRIAGE CERTIFICATE. I am pretty sure he kept it but why??? <<<Thats one of my main questions. HERE is the other question the curious one that leave me stunned everytime since that day. Ok so here it goes saturday feb 14th the day my husband left me. He was in north carolina but funny thing is that following week on tuesday late afternoon i found some papers and trash that were in his car on the street sidewalk in front of my house just sitting there in a pile. Now i know i don't sound crazy but if his mother says he is in north carolina and she did send my important stuff back how the hell did the worthless papers and trash that was from his car end on the sidewalk in front of the house? is my husband trying to tell me something when he left those papers and trash that was in his car? He hasn't contacted me since he left me on valentines day no messages nothing? I asked his mother and asked her if he wanted a divorce and she said she doesn't know but she did say give him time? Now his father and mother are divorced seperated and went there seperate ways and married other people. My husbands father is in the military and in the special forces his dad is stationed in germany. I talked to his father and he told me that he talked to my husband and said his son did mention divorce to him but hasn't since? I really don't know what i am gonna do? i need advice answers from anyone please? My husband still hasn't gave me my other stuff back or the phone i bought for him? does that mean he has my stuff on purpose is he punishing me? I wanted to save the best for last here it goes. My big concern is I know i messed up with my husband. I accused of cheating when he would get off work and come home all the time. My husband never went out he always stayed home with me and i wasn't the nicest wife but when it came to taking care of my husband i was there for him no matter what. I never left my husband. We never really had our own place except when i had my apartment and lost it. Well i am living with my grandparents right now. Funny thing is I was basically homeless when i was with him and he had a job a good job 1 grand every two weeks he made. But we lived off of the from hotel to hotel finally he got laid off his job and when we ran out of money we slept in his car. Well valentines day was the last day he picked up his paycheck and he bought me breakfast that morning and then i went into my grandparents house i  used the bathroom i came out and he was gone. I really think that he was so stressed out and emotionally drained not having a job or having a place to stay. I just wanna know why did he take off on valentines day turned off his phone and hasn't contacted since it has been a week i need answers. I spoke to his dad today and his dad told me that he hasn't sent the rest of my stuff back because he hasn't had the time and he is doing some stuff right now? I asked his dad once again if he mentioned the divorce and he said he is not working on that right now. so whats up
20090220103623AAeLU89	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do you think its worth it?	alright, the other day i went to my friends birthday (by the way we are all 14) anyway, at the party there was this girl that was nice, funny, polite, VERY pretty, she's single, and she is 1 month younger than me.      so we talked some and both liked eathother. i know she likes me, not so sure she likes likes me. anyway two days later i found her on facebook, and asked her to be friends, & she accepted. so we've sent about 7 messages to eachother about 2-3 a day, and i've pretty much decided i would defenately like to date her.       the only setback is she is my semi good friend's sister. i've know this guy for about 2 years. do you think it would be worth it to try and date this insainly amazing girl if it would jepordize my friendship with her brother?      also, i am defenatly friends with this guy, but not really good friends.

20090220104626AAMGHw8	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I think she likes me?	In addition to a few major other points that I recently posted which made people say she liked me, she also acts different when shes with her friends then she does when I just talk to her one on one, and talks to me about guys that when I ask her if she likes shes like "no, but w/e w/e" and she always puts me in hypothetical situations when shes talking about some controversy with a guy, even though she denies liking them most of the time.      The other things she does were being against me liking her close friend, how she said was slutty and drank to much, bad haircut, etc. She also confronted my old friend who Ive never talked to around her, and she asked if we were going out.      In a recent conversation she said I miss you, randomly asked if I liked anyone new, and said we should hang out soon - albeit not in a full out FLIRT way but not in a soley friend way.

Looking for advice from the teenagers here.....My daughter is a very smart girl, just very unorganized. From grade school on she forgets her homework, or it is in her locker, or she put it in the wrong folder...She never turns in her homework! I watch her do it every night (assignments are online), check it, see her put it in her backpack and leave for school. She has no absences. In grade school, they would always just let her go get it or turn it in late. High school is a different story. She is flunking algebra! She has been grounded forever, no change. What would make you change?

20090220105522AAFAbMD	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Rude to invite those who can't come?	We're working on the guest list and I have some people that I would love to have attend the wedding, but I know they will not be able to make it. These are people I'm not real close to but I genuinely like them and enjoy their company when they're around. I'm sending them an invite anyway, because I want them to know I thought of them and wanted them to come. One is a client of mine, an 85 year old woman who herds bulls around her 10,000 acre ranch with a Gator and a cane. She cracks me up, and I'd love to have her at my wedding, though I know she won't be able to make it.      A friend of mine is telling me that since I clearly know these people cannot attend, they will likely view my invitation as not so much an invitation, but as an expectation for a wedding gift.      Is this really something I should be concerned about? I know I've had my feelings hurt in the past when I wasn't invited to an event because the planners assumed I couldn't make it. I thought it was rude they didn't even bother to ask me. Now apparently it's rude to invite someone if you know they can't come?

20090220110631AAQhNRu	Family & Relationships;Family	URGENT advice needed about choosing a graduate program?	I have two choices for graduate schools in biology.       1. University of Michigan, Ann Arbor (ranked 15th in nation)      2. California Institute of Technology (ranked 4th in nation)       I like both schools equally, but Caltech has more prestigious faculty and more focused research. Michigan also has its benefits academically, but it's undeniable that Caltech is the more prestigious/more intense of the two. The money situation is also the same at both schools- they are paying for everything and I get a $26K stipend (same at both schools but goes a longer way in Michigan than LA, obviously).       The biggest question is: Michigan is very close to my family, while if I moved to the LA area I'd only get to see them once a year. Graduate school for me will be 5-6 years (PhD), and I'd like to be near my family since my younger brother is just starting middle school and will go through a difficult stage in life starting now. I'd also like to spend more time with my family, but they are (at least upfront) willing to sacrifice this so that I can go to a better school.       Is it worth it to go to a less good school to be near family for 5-6 years? I know this is ultimately a personal decision, but what do you think?

I am almost going to be 18 and me and my boyfriend are thinking of marriage. we are both going to begin attending community college. We are thinking of getting married in like 3 years or sooner. What questions should i be asking myself? if you got married at a young age, how was life like? financially? how did you get ahead when times were hard in your relationship and when you were struggling financially? do you regret it? I know i should be asking these questions with my boyfriend but i wanted to hear from others who actually got married young.

She had an odor much stronger than I've ever come across. It made me lose my erection. Before I could stop she figured it out. We both knew and she said, "sorry..." and looked away. Then she ran to the bathroom.      While she was in the bathroom I knocked on the door and said, " Hey sweetie, don't be like that. Its OK and I'm sorry. If you want, we can talk about it..."       She went silent for a while and then said, "I'm really sorry. I don't wanna have sex anymore. You're grossed out by me now".      I mean, I was a little grossed out by it but  I was open to accept the fact that females body work differently. Was I a good BF?       Oh and the week prior, we woke up in bed. (I have all white sheets, blanket, pillows).  When she got up.....her side was all red. I told her its ok, I can buy new sheets.

20090220104849AAP42TA	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How to make things work, when it doesn't in the bedroom? 10pts?	My fiancee and I love each other deeply and immensely. we have alot of the same interests and are extraordinarily compatible. we often know what each are thinking and feeling.      In the bedroom, we're very openminded, share all the same wants and needs, and are rarely bored, which is impressive considering the frequency of our intimacy.      no matter what we do though, one thing keeps getting in the way, and makes me go wacky off and on, which I know wouldn't be the case if we didn't have this problem. the basic fact is, that he's not big enough for me. he used to be, back in his hayday, long before we were together, but now, its impossible. we do all kinds of things, crazy fetishes, s&m, darn near anything you can think of (with only the two of us) and nothing works for me. Its all wonderful, but I have to keep going until I hurt too much to function, walk, or continue further, just to get close to being as satisfied as I'd be if his anatomy was bigger.      we're both somewhat nympho, I guess..so you'd think everything would be fine, but its just that his equipment has shrunk from it was 4yrs before we met.       point being, what do we do now? we've been together for over a year, and though this has been an issue the entire time, it wasn't until the novelty of being together wore off, that it took over as the major concern.      anybody else in a relationship with a man who's not big enough? what do you do?      Also, if anyone suggests simply leaving him, I may not take you seriously. I love him, and he loves me, and he's been to the doctor already who told him that other than a multi-thousand dollar surgery which has worse problems in the long run, there's nothing that'll actually fix this.

20090220103645AAjCvWF	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do I back off without causing her to lose interest?	Okay so I've been dating this girl for a couple of months and things seem to be going really well. Earlier this week her friend warned me not to "smother or bug her" but it came up in a way that leads me to believe the girl ive been dating complained about it. Her friend said go at her pace let her text me first, etc. My fear is that she will lose interest in me if I change my behavior and not communicate with her. I understand I could cool it a little bit, but I dont want to change everything thats been working for me so far because as far as I knew she liked it when I would text her.. she told me it makes her smile and her day better whenever I text her. If all of a sudden I'm more distant and stop texting her aren't I risking her losing interest? I just dont get it because she would always say she likes my texts and they make her day bettter and make her smile whenever she gets them (said that like a week ago multiple times) and now it seems like its annoying and I havent changed my behavior at all since we started dating.
20090220105524AAKFgbW	Family & Relationships;Family	Why did I do this to my mother?	Ok this is my story of what happen....    (very sad story)      My mom only had one eye. I hated her... she was such an embarrassment. She cooked for students & teachers to support the family.       There was this one day during elementary school where my mom came to say hello to me. I was so embarrassed. How could she do this to me? I ignored her, threw her a hateful look and ran out.       The next day at school one of my classmates said, "EEEE, your mom only has one eye!" I wanted to bury myself. I also wanted my mom to just disappear.       I confronted her that day and said, " If you're only going to make me a laughing stock, why don't you just die?"       My mom did not respond...       I didn't even stop to think for a second about what I had said, because I was full of anger. I was oblivious to her feelings.       I wanted out of that house, and have nothing to do with her. So I studied real hard, got a chance to go abroad to study.       Then, I got married. I bought a house of my own. I had kids of my own.       I was happy with my life, my kids and the comforts. Then one day, my mother came to visit me.       She hadn't seen me in years and she didn't even meet her grandchildren.       When she stood by the door, my children laughed at her, and I yelled at her for coming over uninvited.       I screamed at her, “How dare you come to my house and scare my children! GET OUT OF HERE! NOW!!!”      And to this, my mother quietly answered, “Oh, I'm so sorry. I may have gotten the wrong address,” and she disappeared out of sight.       One day, a letter regarding a school reunion came to my house. So I lied to my wife that I was going on a business trip.       After the reunion, I went to the old shack just out of curiosity.       My neighbors said that she died. I did not shed a single tear.       They handed me a letter that she had wanted me to have.       “My dearest son,       I think of you all the time. I'm sorry that I came to your house and scared your children. I was so glad when I heard you were coming for the reunion.       But I may not be able to even get out of bed to see you.       I'm sorry that I was a constant embarrassment to you when you were growing up.       You see when you were very little, you got into an accident, and lost your eye.       As a mother, I couldn't stand watching you having to grow up with one eye. So I gave you mine.       I was so proud of my son who was seeing a whole new world for me, in my place, with that eye.       With all my love to you,       Your mother.”
20090220103722AAvdmFi	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	OWI Charge............?	My boyfriend of 2 years just got charged with OWI on friday the 13th.  At first I felt a bit sorry for him since he first fell down and smacked his head on the pavement, then got in his truck and rammed into a pole and then got arrested in front of his house for being over the limit.  After a few days I'm just mad as hell because I am carting his *** around everywhere and what makes me so bitter is I complained over and over about his drinking habits.  So tonight I have to drive 60 miles and pick his daughter up, which is making me even more mad.  I am planning on telling him tonight, I'm not going to be the one who you can rely on for transportation this next 6 months because if he expects me to, I'm just going to be bitter.  Do I need to show him some tough love here?

20090220104159AAiUKJV	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Ladies, what do you think of a 40 year old man working at McDonald's or Jack In The Box?	Would you date him or even give him the time of day if he tried to speak to you?  Let's say you didn't know where he worked at first then he told you later?        What if that was the only job he could find in this economy?      I was on another message board and read the story of a guy who was let go from his full time job a few months ago.  His company is contesting his unemployment and the only job he could find was one that allowed him to work out of his house for 3.5 hours a day diong at home customer service work.  His girl was complaining that she felt he had it too good working from home while she was out working 40 hours a week.  He can take a shower at 2 PM if he wanted to.  Had his mornings free to do what he wanted and only had to work 3.5 hours a day.  This is part time with no benefits.        The other women were also complaining that he was a lazy bumb and in the 3 months since he was layed off why didn't he go to work at McDonald's or somewhere like that to make some money?  One guy replied that these are the very same women who are complaining that he didn't work at McDonald's but the minute a 40 year old starts working at McDonald's to bring some money home they are complaining he's too old to be flipping burgers.      What's your take on it?

20090220104707AApYy9a	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What would you do in this situation? did I make the right choice?	Ok this is really awkward. I met this guy last week at random, and we started talking, and I guess he really liked me and kept telling me how hot I was. (I'm 19 and he's 21 btw) Anyway, he's been bugging me to go out with him, but I've been putting it off. (honestly, I just dont feel like I'm that interested in him)      So anyway, this morning he told me hes going to be in town today, and he wanted to see me. I was starting to soften, and I thinking that maybe I should give him a chance, when out of no where, he said he just wants to make out with me. And I was kind of puzzled, and said that I would go on a date with him, but I dont know about that.       THEN he started offering me money! He said he would give me $5000 if I would make out with him and let him feel me up! I freaked out! At first I thought he was kidding, and then he started saying he`d go get the cash before hand and blah blah blah.       Anyway, I pretty much lost it on him, told him I`m not a prostitute, I dont want his money, and I was really offended! He just kept saying "I dont think ur a prostitute. Its just making out thats all I want. I thought you could use the money for school." (which is true)       Anyway, did I make the right decision? I thought that was really really suspicious. And I feel really really dirty now just for being asked that! I can't believe he would think I'm like that! What would you have done?

20090220104736AAtMEze	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	(points to the best answer)What are things girls like to talk about with guys they just met?	I need something to start a good conversation with a girl I like.I like being able to keep a long conversation because it means she's interested in at least knowing who I am.I don't want to be the guy friend that talks about girlish things.I want to be able to make a connection with her like I did the first time we met. Maybe something to get her interested in me. She is a exchange student from China, and even if I can't make a connection with her as a girl friend I at least want to have another friend. It is hard to talk to girls that I like or any girls for that matter unless I see past the fact that they are girls. Sometimes it seems as if we are from two different worlds(men are from mars and women are from venus etc.)and that psychs me out of talking.

20090220105342AAPN4Xx	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Fathers.. Do you still think your wife is sexy after she had a baby?	I had a baby a little over a year ago and I am having a very hard time losing the weight. I was VERY skinny before I got pregnant and gained too much weight during the pregnancy. Now I have a belly and stretch marks and feel completely unsexy. I don't really feel like having sex all that much because all I am thinking about is if he thinks I look gross. He tells me all the time how he thinks I am beautiful but I have a hard time believing it. Men & fathers... do you still think your wives are sexy even if she has a little extra weight or stretch marks? I think if I knew how other men felt, it might help me get over my insecurities during "the deed". BTW... I am SLOWLY losing the weight and plan on being skinny again but I think no matter what I am still going to have some tummy issues (loose skin, stretch marks, etc.).

I have a boyfriend that i have been with for almost 2 years. We love each other very much. He is my ray of sunlight. I can't stand being away from him. We have faced some very ruff times and have gotten by each once I have had sex with him one. I don't regret having had done it being that I love him so damn much. I don't want to lose him but Sex has become a big issue. I'm scared to do it again for the following reasons:      . I'm a Christian and it took a lot of me to do it the first time. I don't want to have to live a life in sin. I want to change and serve the lord the way He deserves.       . I'm Scared of getting pregnant.       My boyfriend feels we should make love because he loves me and I love him as well. I however, see it a different way i want to have sex and not have any worries. I love him with all my heart and would be heartbroken to lose him. I DON'T WANNA LEAVE HIM and i don't want him 2 leave me and i know he loves me cuz he shows me each day how much he does so what do i do? Sex is becoming a problem. He says he cant be Celibate for much longer and he doesn't know if he can. I understand he is a man and that men crave for sex...i just don't know what to do...PLEASE HELP ME voice ur opinion or advice thank you very much....

20090220110406AA7pHTr	Family & Relationships;Friends	There is a devil in my life....what would you do about her....?	So long story short, I had this friend(ashlee) I got her a job at my work, set her up with my best friend, and slowly she has ruined friendships. She has hurt everyone of my friends by making rude comments, she has put us in danger at bars by trying to start fights with guys. She got my punched in the face by a guy at the bar because of her loud mouth. She has never said sorry for anything, her bf and my bf lived together and were best friends. They are now no longer friends because she got in the middle she got my bf kicked out of there house so she could move in. She now still works with me and I need for her to get fired! I cant stand looking at her everyday of my life. oh yes one more thing.....everything is a game to her,, she messes with peoples heads to get what she wants....what would u do to get her outta your life.....by the way we are all joined with the same group of friends....so we will always have contact in one way or another.
20090220110651AAnFxqL	Family & Relationships;Friends	How To Deal With A Troubled Best Friend?	My best friend is having a lot of issues at home. I have a feeling it involves her parents and drinking. She's a very good girl, an excellent student, but very quiet. It took us a while to establish any sort of relationship but we are very close. I offered my help and insight, but she turned it down, upset. She got very angry and told me that I can't relate to her and make her feel better. I always do try to help her or make her feel better by ATTEMPTING to relate, and maybe that's my own mistake. I can't push her into telling her what's bothering her, so I decided to let her come to me.      Another thing is she thinks people think her house-hold is sane. My father and mother are very insightful people and told me they new otherwise, they've known for a while that things weren't quite right. And I personally think that their cover up tactics have become tired. You can only lie so much to people, and perhaps my best friends mom and dad have friends who are blind and not very astute, but I know what I've seen and I can surmise a great deal through behavior and actions.      I guess what I'm trying to ask is how can I get her to be more open with her emotions. I can't stand walking around on egg shells or seeing her in pain, her family obviously needs to work out these issues because it's tearing her down along with her siblings. I don't think she can consider me someone to come and speak to because I can't relate to her predicament. That burns me down because I'm a very loving, passionate, and warm person-even if I can't relate, I can always listen without helping.
20090220110958AAk8qX2	Family & Relationships;Family	Would you stay or would you move?	Ok, here's the background.  I'm from NY (not the city, the middle of nowhere) and I went in the military.  Got stationed in CA and met my husband.  We had our first son, got out of the military, and moved to GA when my son was 7 weeks old.  I had some family there and thought it was between my family in NY and his family in FL.  Life outside the military was harder than we thought it'd be so GA didn't work out.  We moved to FL where my husband had a better job opportunity just before my son's 1st b-day.  In FL was all of my husband's family and a cousin for my son.  There were some issues between us and part of the family, so I started missing my own family really bad.  I loved where we lived, there was plenty to see, and the weather was almost always nice.  We decided to move to NY because of missing my family.  At that point my son was almost 2 1/2 yrs old.  So we move to NY, have some more rough times, but I'm happy because I have some of my family.  (My mom and brother live in GA)  I hate the weather and there is almost nothing to do around here unless you drive an hour+ and spend a lot of money.  Well my husband gets a good job, everything gets settled down again, we have another baby.  My sister leaves NY and joins the military.  Now all that's left are my parents and younger sis and brother.  Well my brother is probably going to leave soon too and my parents keep talking about moving an hour or so away.  I really miss where I was in FL and I'm sad that my sons can't be around their cousins.  None of my sibs have kids yet.  I hate the winter and I don't like where we live.  I want to move back to FL and so does my husband.  It's been almost 3 yrs since we moved to NY and my sons are of course very attached to their grandparents.  I want to convince my parents to move down to FL.  They don't have much family up here, they hate the winter, and they hate their jobs.  So, would you stay where you are or would you move?  What if you could convince your parents to move too?  Sorry it's so long, but I wanted to explain all the background.
20090220110931AALjkuZ	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Is it just me or is this weird....?	my SIL wants to bring her children to my lingerie shower next week. she texted me asking if it was ok, but i haven't replied yet. is it just me or is that weird?? that side of the family is super dramatic, so if i told her to get a sitter, she'd make a big deal out of it, but i don't want kids there!      any suggestions?
20090220112239AAAroGj	Family & Relationships;Friends	How many friends do you have that are nothing like you/?	Let me try to explain what I mean.   It's easy to see people like ourselves, either by age, race, religion or financial status, and relate easily  to them and hit it off.  Even people whose life resembles our own fall into the category of being easier to relate to.     For example, I am  a married mom with children.  It is pretty easy for me to become friends with other married mons with children, but how easy is it for us to befriend people who aren't just like us?   Granted, I know no one is JUST like us, but you get my point.   The question is how many friends do you have that are not very *like* you?  How easy is it for you to be friends with people who are VERY different than you.     And then the flip side is do you think it is a conscience choice or circumstance?

We are best friends, he tells me he loves me and that there is no one else, and it's not about sex (we don't do it anymore),It's more of a mental connection, I feel that he means it when he says he loves me, is it because I'm overweight? it breaks my heart, I try to end the friendship, but he won't let me, there is no one else in his life, I'm sure of that, and he says he doesn't want anyone else, and that we have is more than enough for him now.... But deep down I want more... please help
20090220112205AAHzgMm	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I asked this guy I am talking to if...?	I was being a pain by contacting him. I don't want to seem clingy and that is why I asked.  I don't text him every day.  He will text me every now and then. If I don't hear from him in 3 days I will text him.  I know he has a busy work schedule. He is a cop and a volunteer firefighter. We hung out three times in the past month. I text him last night asking him when we can hang out and he told me that he was going away this weekend and then going to Miami for bike week and he will be gone for 9 days.  I then text him asking him if I was coming off as being a pain. He replied with - your not a pain at all. I just have to figure out a time. Between working nights and going away the days fill up. Less going out for him and he does make up for it when he does go out. (I believe he is telling the truth about me not being a pain, because if he thought I was then I don't think he would have responded.) He said he ends up paying for it because the times we have hung out together we will stay out all night when we both had to be to work the next morning with only a few hours sleep. His shifts change and aren't always the same. My question is, what should I say in response to his text?  I am interested in him.  I understand being a cop you end up having all weird hours (my brother is a cop) and that there isn't much time to socialize. I went out last weekend and text him to come by and visit me (he was working) and he did.  He met me outside for about 20 minutes.  I want to ask him if he is interested in me, but I don't know if I should wait longer to ask him. Should I wait to see where this goes or should I move on? We only communicate through texting.  To sum things up I was the one who approached him and he said that he never had that happen to him before.  We messed around and we both enjoyed it (he told me that he enjoyed it and that I drove him crazy) We knew each other before we hung out, but we weren't friends.  I met him from dealing with my ex-husband by doing exchanges at this guys police station.  He would always be there when I went there and we would talk for a while since I always have to wait 40 minutes for my ex to drop off the kids.  What should I do and what should I say in response to his text.  I am 30 he is 36.  Sorry that it's so long.

Okay, so I saw the girl I like for the first time yesterday when we went to the movies in a group. All my friends that know I like her told me I should make a move, but I am not confident yet, so I want to flirt. I was to tell her that she looked really hot, but I need a smooth way to say it. Also, her name means beauty(I was bored so I looked up the name meanings of all my friends' names)so I want to maybe use that too. What are some classy and smooth ways to tell her she looked beautiful?      Thank you, my friends   ~Templar Rock!
20090220113100AA3GAc3	Family & Relationships;Friends	Friend question!!! .....?	Okay, is it better to have a select few friends who are your REAL friends but you rarely see ( and therefore, have a lot of alone time or time just with acquaintences? ) or to have a group of friends who are always around but are NOT real friends at all...people who are judgemental of you, hard on you, manipulative, etc. So what's better...being a little lonely because you can only see the people you love most once in a great while, or having lots of people around who make your life more difficult??? Loneliness or hassle/drama???
20090220120040AA2yfZF	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My boyfriend called me naive, should I be mad?	We were arguing because I'm going to the movies with my friends and he says that I shouldn't be going on a group date, because I'm his girlfriend.      But its not really a group date, its just my friends and some guys. I don't even like any of them. But he says there just going to want to hook up with us, and I told him that he's just jealous.      Then he was like, "your so naive.."      So...what's that about? Is he  saying that I'm stupid and don't no anything? Should I be mad? Is he right?

It's not just a case of me wanting to have sex but I specifically want to do it with him.       I know that if I text him or something asking him to come over he would but there's a principle at hand. He treated me kinda badly but he was SO good in bed. In fact I had sex with him twice after we split. It's been a years since then and I want him so bad but I need to stay away from him.      What can I do? I'm at my wits end.

20090220120916AAd4xyM	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Please answer. I'm so confused.?	My best friend has made me fall in love with him by showing me all kinds of affection. He has a girlfriend and he claims that he doesn't love me. I told him...   "a lot of women only want one man and the biggest thing that they require of someone they're in a relationship with is that you remain faithful to them. Being faithful to your girlfriend shouldn't be hard unless you still have feelings for me."      He said "I think I just want your affection."   Then I said "You don't need my affection. I don't know why you want affection from me when you can get it from your girlfriend."   He said "You're right."      He still hasn't told me why he really wants my affection and I'd like to know why. Has anyone else been in this situation? I need answers as to why someone would do that to someone else.
20090220120052AATdYlE	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What's the difference - relationship girl + 1-night-only girl?	When a guy sees a girl, what makes him want her as a gf and what makes him think 'booty call'?    My friend told me how to 'act flirty' to attract guys, she showed me how to stand, what signals to give....etc and while she was demonstrating this, some guy comes up to her...she ends up having a one night stand even though she was 'attracting a boyfriend' which means she was giving the wrong signals so.......what are the right signals?

20090220120956AAd9M2j	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What kind of impression do I give off to girls?	Let's say you have a decent looking guy (thin, nice smile, works out, not overly tall.) He's kinda funny and his buddies enjoy his company. He obviously drank A LOT and seems only interested in having fun. When he talks to you (and he tries to talk to everyone at some point or another) he's friendly but not a doormat by any means and seems uninterested in pursuing anything sexual or flirting. He generally smiles a lot and enjoys a good laugh. Near the end of the night he becomes worn out, most likely gets sick privately, and then calls it a night without telling anyone.      At mornings he's composed. He's still friendly and  However, he seems to want to gather his friends and leave wherever he is. He still talks, although less, but seems more focused on his friends then on any girl. He does not try to get a phone number, facebook name, msn, or anything.      Anyway, I'm wondering what kind of impression do I give off?

20090220113140AAiNYWH	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Need some ideas for a FUN backyard bbq reception?	We are getting married at a different location near a waterfall but thought about having a backyard bbq for a reception where we live. We live on my fiance's grandparents farm. They have a really pretty red barn and we though about having our reception next to it. Plus they have an orchard next to the barn which we think MIGHT be in bloom at the time.       Here is what we kind of planned on having so far for our reception:      FOOD   Hamburgers (may substitute the burgers for brisket - looking at the price difference on that at the moment), Hot Dogs, Baked Beans, Potato Salad, Green Salad with choice of homemade Italian or Ranch dressing, chips, dip, maybe a veggie tray, lots of sweets including the bride and grooms cake.      DECORATIONS   Maybe use some real flowers from a grocery store for the tables. We thought about decorating mason jars and putting the flowers inside those. Then I would probably use silk flowers to dress up the black wooden fence around the barn. They have some pretty decent ones at hobby lobby and they always have sales on that kind of stuff.       We also thought of using those big galvonized metal looking tubs to put ice/drinks in.      I think I will either use gingham print table covers or I might just go with some other solid color. I really don't want to use white because it is so overused but I don't want to be tacky either.      We also planned on using bales of hay (they have a loft full of hay that we could use) for guests to sit on. We will probably still set up a couple of tables as well though.      ENTERTAINMENT   I think this is where we need the most help. We don't really have the money for a live band or anything so we will probably just do the ipod thing.       Should we set up games for people to play? I.e. horseshoes?           Any ideas are appreciated! I would love to hear some new, fresh ideas or anything unique. We really don't want the whole "formal" thing going on. I could care less if people make toasts and I actually prefer they don't lol. Also we don't want dancing either. We really just want something more laid back.
20090220113221AAbWHBF	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How can I enforce the removal of my estranged husband's possessions from our marital home, which I am paying?	We have been separated since July of 2007, impending a divorce that awaits settlement of the property on which I have been paying and maintaining.   His possessions continue to contain a good portion of my basement.   He feels that since we are still legally married he has the right to keep them in our legal marital home.   I have been more than fair- my attorney suggested I write a time of the essence letter regarding the removal of his possessions by the end of March.  My estranged husband told me I cannot legally threaten to dispose of his possessions if they are not picked up.   I am so frustrated!!!  What can I do???  Thanks in advance!!
20090220113559AAHmvhp	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Help! he is stalking me?	Ok, so ive been hanging out with this guy for about three weeks now and he has a big crush on me. Hes really nice and cute and he is the most popular guy in school yadda, yadda, yadda....and its now the holidays and he has been contacting me non-stop; texting, calling, emailing...at first i found it really flattering but now it has just gotten out of hand...seriously, i have gotten 60 texts from him since sunday and 37 missed calls since monday. ALL from HIM! I guess i am partly to blame because whenever he sends something flirtatious i cant say "back off" so i kinda flirt back. We've been on vacation for a week now and me calls me his girlfriend, hunny, sweetie.. he thinks we're a couple and i just cant take it anymre i had to turn off my cell phone because im getting physically nauseous.   We have a double date to the movies week with his friend and girlfriend and he told me he wants to make out the whole time. At first i was okay with it but yesterday he used the L WORD! this is just happening WAY too fast..like warp speed..and i dont want anything serious. We're only 15 for god's sake..   at first i considered telling him to slow down but he's kind of scaring me and i just want him to leave me alone. What should i do because school starts next week and i dont want to face him!!!

20090220111152AAVwdZU	Family & Relationships;Friends	Why is this happening to me?	Ever since I started year 11 ive somehow changed. I used to be good friends with a group of girls in my year but now I don't even talk to any of them, maybe '' hi and bye'' but that's about it. All they ever do now  is talk about boys, gossip about other girls and act plain rude.They have formed their own group and even have a name for it, which in a way makes me feel left out but i think i prefer it that way. I talk to a few people occasionally but now i keep my mouth shut because people tend to feel awkward around me or im tongue tied. I don't know what's happened to me, i used to be filled with life and yes i do admit i was sometimes annoying. But now i prefer being on my own, I hardly go out and even if i do its because im on the way to the library or the local shops. I am quite close to a girl that is in my year but she also has her own friends. I feel so weird, the thought of starting college in september has even freaked me out because of the way i behave now.       Why am i acting like this?

This is a debate with someone, who thinks Lust is part of Love.   This is her reply:   "Love doesn't 'beat' lust. Lust, and sex, are a PART of love"      But im just thinking thats not true, because people just love sex, and not love that person. Love & lust is two complete word... u can show affection, but its different from lust.      You should "Love" before u "Lust"

20090220111519AADEv50	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is this too much for a guy?	Ok. So I started dating this guy, we've gone out 4 times total...he is coming over t'nite for dinner that i'm cooking at my house. He had given me a really sweet valentine's day card & present & a rose..in the card he stated he's really hoping that this is the "first of many v'days to come". Since then we txt/talk alot over the phone and he's always saying sweet things. Today he called to say good morning beautiful (aww) before i headed off to work, followed by asking if i still had his v-day stuff to give to him (i'd forgotten it at home that nite). So, given the circumstances, I found this card today, and here's what it says inside:      "With every moment we share, every touch, I become more certain that,in you, I've found something I've looked for for a long time. I don't know what the future holds, but I do know how much your touch excites me and how happy i feel when I'm with you...and for now, that's more than enough."      So my question is, this card, is it too much to give to a guy that i've been dating less than a month?      Thanks & 10 pts to best answer!

I am white, he is black. His mom is racist and HATES me. She does not think his daughter is his and refuses to say she is her grand-daughter. She says she doesn't want a white trash child in her house (speaking about our daughter). She calls me a whore and keeps trying to convince my boyfriend to leave me. Our daughter looks exactly like her father. My boyfriend and i have a great relationship and we are a happy family but his mother is causing fights between us. She always calls and says our daughter is not his and our daughter is too ugly to be her sons daughter. This is making it extremely tough. How do i cope with this? This is stressing me out to no end and i ball my eyes out. She has NEVER liked me and always says im a white trash hoe. I just don't understand why she won't except our beautiful baby girl. I've bent over backwards to get her to except me and my daughter but she won't. He does stick up for me and his daughter but his mom always makes him feel bad by saying "you just want me to die don't you!" or "you dont love me!!" and the whole process starts all over. He stopped talking to her for two months due to her treating me and our daughter like she has but then she calls and says " what if i died in those two months, how could you not care if your own mother dies!!" and stuff to that nature and it makes my boyfriend extremely upset because he lost his father 3 1/2 years ago unexpectedly.. I dont know what to do.. Please help?? I love him but his mother is CRAZY!

20090220112837AA3Fsq3	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Is he taking sides or what?	His place is very cold, I can't fall asleep when I'm cold. I usually wear socks and a sweater when it's that cold. I went over last week, at night I turned on the heater. He turned it off before the house was warm. He said he couldn't breathe. I got very annoyed and I turned it into a child..I turned it onn he turned it off, I finally left his bedroom and slept in the couch. His daughter came over the following day , they are 17 and 22. At night he told them to turn the heater if they want, they did and it was on all night. He never complained about anything. Why is he taking sides? Which means its not ok when I do stuff but its ok when his gilrs do. One more thing the other day around 8:30 they wanted Ice Cream and he drove to the stores to get it. They even told him what cups they want. So the next day I pretended to want something badly and asked him to go to the stores, but he refused. So what's the deal? Should I ask him why he does stuff for his 17 and 22 daugher but not me.
20090220111446AAZIf6X	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	We have been together for a few years now?	There has been so much said the last few weeks and I am so confused and hurt by most of them.  The day after Valentines he told me that he was going to ask me to marry him but I talked him out of leaving that night because he said that he was going to a different state to buy a house. Then I found out that he was talking to my father who he knows I am not talking to because he feels he needs to ba a man even tho my father is not a man. This morning he said sometimes he wonders if I would be better off with someone closer to my age, who can spend more time with me rather then all his time is at work. I told him that was ridicules. I love him even if he does work a lot. We are not to far in age either. 20 and 27. I have recently decided to go to school and he loves the idea. He says that he wants to marry me it is just in time. I also want kids and he is unsure of when he wants them. With him working all the time I wonder if we will ever do these things. What do I do? Am I wrong for having these feelings? What is going on with him?

I love him so much and I know he loves me. But he's broken so many promises...some tht r pretty bad and I've always forgiven him because I love him. Until now. We had a huge fight and he broke up with me. His best friend/brother then came over to comfort me, and that's when he admitted to me that the entire time my boyfriend and I were going out he has been in love with me...but he's going out with my best friend...and now my ex boyfriend is trying to win me back too. I told them both that I need time to think. I thought and I came to the decision of choosing neither of them cuz I don't think I'm good enough for either one of them...did I make the right choice? I love them both so much for very different reasons. What would you have done?
20090220120931AARqFvp	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Do you have a Prenup? (Prenuptial Agreement) Please share! Thinking about tying the knot w/ my partner.?	I want to hear from mens perspective and womens.        I want to hear from the person who originally thought it up    - how did you draw it up, how did you originally bring it up?   - what are the key points you chose to include?   - would you do it any differently?   - why did you do it? (insecurity in relationship, didn't want to lose your life's work or sacrifices you had made to accumulate a house, business etc)               And from the person who had it brought to them:   - what did you think when your partner showed it to you?    - had it already been discussed or was it a surprise?   - was it easy to swallow or did it make you bitter they would ask you to sign it?     -  was there anything specifically included that you really didn't like or was an issue?   - did it change the relationship or your view of your lover    - how did you go about interpretting it    - did they read it to you and explain it or just give it to you and tell you to read it on your own?   - did you bring it to a lawyer to have it reviewed?   - did you ask to change anything in it?   - was there a negotiation process to having anything changed and how did it work, was it just you and your hubby talking it over together or did you both draw it up on paper first and hand your terms back & forth until you could agree?  were there lawyers involved in negotiations?      Background info:   I have worked hard to get where I am, love my family, but do want to protect myself should things take a turn down an unexpected road.  Also, I am having trouble bringing up the idea of a prenup, and would rather not do one if we don't need to because I don't want to "doom" our wonderful relationship ( we have been through a lot, she has overcame drinking problems, debt lifestyle, etc and now we live within our means and now enjoy a somewhat simpler life).  I want to build our life together and have that take precedence.  But also make sure I don't lose all I've worked for should something happen.         ***Even More Notes(for those of you who really want to know)***   I love my partner, will always be 100% faithful and do plan on spending the rest of my life with them.  I want to get married, but we have had relationship issues (fine now) and am worried that if I don't get something in writing then I could wind up having to support them.  Heaven forbid that were to happen I have no qualms about paying my my fair share to make sure the kids have what they need!  But I wouldn't want to have to support an ex who chose not to work.         I am mainly worried about my real estate (that I do not own at this point but the deed is in my name and we live there now with our children).  It's only one house at this point, that has been bought while we were together in our relationship but 100% by me - I pay the mortgage and don't ask for any rent (it seems silly even saying that!).  For all intensive purposes - we are married and I work/ support the family while they raise the family and do not work.  We live in a state where cohabitation is not a common law.  How do prenups deal with one partner choosing to stay home and raise the children?  Is the law in most states such that partner who stays home supposed to be compensated by the other partner?      Parter does not have great credit (amassed debt before our relationship) and I do not want to be responsible for that though maybe theres no way around that - I have helped them pay this down a little at a time.  I do plan on buying more houses as a part time real estate business - owner occupied duplexes and such and then renting them out, but as they are owner occupied would my partner qualify as part owner if we were to get married and then split up even though her name isn't on the mortgage?

I have a 6 year old daughter and he has custody of his 8 year old daughter which I raise as my own.  He says he doesn't want marriage to be my idea and he wants to do it on his own.  We are both divorced.  He didn't want to really marry his ex-wife, but did and she turned out to be as would call a looser.  She never worked or took care of anything around the house or with the child.  I work a full time job and do all the normal household duties.        I am almost 30 and I am ready to remarry.  He wants to have a baby but says we don't have to be married to have a child.  Our relationship is good and we do not have any problems.  Is this normal for a guy or is he just not that into me?

20090220113636AAXlssb	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What do I do when I'm in a stressful situation and It feels like my relationship is ending?	I've been completely stressed out since the beginning of February. On the second week of February we planned a trip to see each other because both of our birthdays are next to each other plus Valentine's was a day after so we thought it was sweet. Some stuff had happened and the trip was pushed to another day. Once again it was pushed back and then calls stop coming often like they used too and I asked him why he doesn't call late at night like he used too. I don't recall getting a full answer. So I've begin getting suspicious and wondering whats got him acting strange and then he keeps telling me don't worry and just keep faith and stop being negative because its gone happen. Then I've begin to think he's holding off our trip for other reasons. So what should I do about this situation? I'm thinking to myself that I'm a fool in love or is it just I'm overreacting??? But then yesterday he says that Im very negative and he's fed up. He told me he loves me but I need to take the time out for myself and just get more positive like I used to be. But honestly I haven't been this negative about things until this happened cause it was just starting to look like I was never going to see him and I got frustrated. I even asked him should we just cancel the trip and don't worry about but he keeps giving me these mixed signals...What should I do? Should I spy? Should I leave it alone or should I just leave him? Which is going to be very hard for me because I love him.
20090220120830AABsJVC	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What can i do to get my husband's attention?	well I am 21 year-old college student. I am not trying to be cocky, but every body says I am attractive, ever one but my husband. The one and only I want attention from.   we got married when I was 19, I got pregnant 4 months after we got married, and everything changed!!!! My pregnancy wasn't a accident, we planned the whole thing.I gained only 23lbs, and 2 months after having my daughter I already got my body back.I work out, I tan, I put makeup on every day, I straight my hair everyday(i have curly hair) I do every thing for HIM, and only for Him, because I want him to want me....I dont know why, he just wont look at me as a woman. He spent $400 last month with porn. He was sleeping on the couch almost every night, and I didnt know why... I just realized when the cable bill came. He is always tired to have sex with me, but never tired to see whores on tv. I am so jealous of those women. My husband just dont see me as a attractive woman. why???maybe because i odnt have fake boos, and I dont act like a whore????    He used to like strippers, i didnt know that. his sister told me that these days.Do you think I should act slutty??that is not how i am but if this will make me get my husband attention I ll do it.   I dress up for him often,I do whatever he wants me to, but he just dont wanna have anything to do with me.    he is mean with words, and he hurts me really bad.   yesterday i wanted to talk to him because has been forever since  the last time we slept together,and  out of the sudden he said to me he is just NOT ATTRACTED to me anymore. he doesnt know why.he says he thinks i am beautiful, and hot but i dont turn him on anymore.i cried so bad and he told me to go to my room because i sounded like a l cry baby and I was annoying him.   why is that??   what can I do?

20090220112800AAIBru7	Family & Relationships;Friends	Do controlling people know they are controlling?	A friend and my mother are controlling people, they won't compromise or ask others what they want to do. No matter what I say I want to do in response to their email about a vacation, it is set that we are going to this location for this amount of time.  Do controlling people know they are being controlling? Also, controlling also seems to be another word for selfish.  Helping these people realize they are controlling may make things worse for the relationships.  Just minimizing the amount of time I spend with these people may be the only solution!
20090220112425AAXuQ1n	Family & Relationships;Friends	Could it be what we think it is?	I think my best friend and I are falling in love......and this can't be happening for either of us (details are not important)...but yet it very much is. We live 1000 miles away from each other and lead different lives...conjoining the two are impossible (possible but not the route we WANT to take) We talk to each other all day everyday, by phone, text, and by webcam come night time until the wee hours of the morning. Our friendship has progressed and we are both aware of this...but both seem to be stumbling around the words that we both want to say sooo badly. We both often talk about "making love" to each other, holding each other, and just enjoying each other so much.....does this sound like what I think it does?? Can someone give me some insight on what to do when you have fallen in love with your best friend, whom you can never have for too many reasons to name...?

20090220112538AAA6YEu	Family & Relationships;Family	Question about living with my dad? Please dont bash. thanks.?	Recently we have moved into my fathers home ( my parents are divorced). I am 25 yrs old my husband is 29 yrs old and we have a 6 yr old daughter. We moved into a apartment in sept of last year everything was great at 1st ( it was a little pricey but we loved it) turn to find out the place was infested with mice. We caught 14 and reported it in nov nothin done so in jan we moved out to move in sept we had just spent over 1,000 dollars. Ok back to my question lol . Is it tacky or werid to live at my dad's house so we can fix our credit to buy a house? This is going to take 1 yr and a half. Or should we get another apartment and have to wait for about 5 yrs to buy a home?? I just dont know what to do! Also wanted to add my husband has been on 3 day work weeks for about 3 months now. I work full time but I got a garnishment from a car i gave back to a bank and they take 25 percent of my paycheck. Oh and my dad lives in a 5 bedroom 3 bath home by himself. What are your thoughts?

I signed it, rather than put anonymous.     ...do you think she'll get the hint I like her, or are sending flowers to a girl too cliche in this day and age?
20090220113734AAyJlC9	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Why is she so worried about MY life?	Well this lady got custody of me when I was younger and I've been staying with her for quite a while. I'm 18 now so she's no longer my guardian. We never really been close and I honestly don't like some of the things she does. I now have a baby and I'm still with the father of my child. He used to work but they laid him off and now he plans to go to Job Corps. He dresses how he feels comfortable and she always talks about how he sags and basically just criticizes him.       She doesn't allow him to stay the night, barely eat, or shower over here. Which I understand because it's her house. I'm grown now and I want to have a real family. I want to move into my own place because I get tired of hearing her criticize him and I mean I can't even have people over if I want them to. I'm applying for public housing and I mean I know it's not the best place to live, but I just want to live under my own rules ya know?      And she was like so you're going to make the food for you and your baby stretch just to feed him? I was like that's the father of my child and he's a good father at that. If I want to feed him then that's what I'm going to do. I mean am I suppose to be selfish and cold hearted just because you don't like him? And then I was like he helps me with the baby and I appreciate that because it's not alot of men out here that do that with their children. And she said, "Oh so you're weak?" I was like no i'm not weak I can take care of my child by myself by all means! I just appreciate the fact that he's here for her ya know? And she said well I would think about my child first. And that it's sad that my child would have to tell her friends that I live in the projects.      I'm thinkin well damn are you going to pay 700 a month for me to get an apartment. No! Well then..keep ya comments to urself. I thank God for what I have now and I don't complain about what I don't have. Like I said I know it's not the best place to live but atleast my daughter and I will have a roof over my head.      Anyways, I'm just wondering why does she always criticize him and put her 2 cents in about what I want to do with my life? Do you think she's right or wrong? She's just ridiculous because one day I was going to bring my baby to her job so her friends at her work could see her and my baby's father was with me because he went to my appointment with me. And she was like are you just going to catch the bus home because I don't want him at my job saggin. I'm think.. why does he have to impress those people? Why does he have to impress you? He's not your man or your son so why are u worried about it!!!??      Please give your opinions on this I would really like to know how I can deal with this! Thanks in advance!
20090220113748AA1CqnY	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Dating again when i have a young child?	I've finally decided that leaving my boyfriend is the only way Im going to be happy and its the best decision for my sons well being. I know my son should have his father in his life but I dont want my son to grow up to be like his father at all. He's verbally abusive, very manipulative and pretty much just always trys to make me feel bad about myself. I'm not trying to take my son from him, but for my own sanity I need to leave. The only reason I've been staying with him is because im scared I wont find anyone else. After putting up with his bs for 3 years i'd rather be single forever than stay with him. Has anyone been in a simmilar situation and found someone who treated them right? Im still young so I hope i can find someone to love me and my son

20090220115028AAiTOMi	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Does this sound like there is cheating?	My husband and I have been on the rocks. I believe he is very critical of me. I recently went into a private work email. And foudn that he was going to help a woman that he works with. I was honest about how I found out and he said he was going to talk with me. I was upset he made arrangments with a woman without talking to me first.    I notice he is working out a lot, taking great detail into his appearence. Used to be when I called he would answer. Or when I would text, i;d get one right back. I feel he is ignoring me. He comes home at night. But during the day 9 am to 9 pm he works. he is often traveling through the day, so schedule could be flexible.    I havent noticed any weird phone numbers or numbers at odd times.    What do you think. gut? it tells me something is up. But I cant find anything.How do I get to the bottom of this to ease my mind.    I have asked. But lately all we do is fight. Btw. we never have sex. We used to almost daily, for a few months straight, now we are at maybe once a week if I try to initiate it

20090220115304AAYyd61	Family & Relationships;Family	Living with Mother In Law and constantly receive unwanted advice / grievances. HELP!?	My husband and I moved in w/ my MIL 2 years ago, because she was going to lose her home and is on a fixed income.  Our son is 1 year old and we are expecting our second child in a couple months.  Since I am a stay at home mom and she doesn't work, I have her for "company" ALL day.  My issue is that she is a little crazy (to put it lightly).  I constantly hear about the neighbor who is a cop doing things to her property from years ago and how every little thing (a broken tree branch, snapped pole, etc) is this cop, even though my husband will tell her that the tree snapped with the heavy snow we just got and that he broke the pole.  She still blames the cop and hearing about it all the time stresses me out to no end.  I've told her I don't want to hear about it, but she'll still continue on and on.   With my son, she constantly asks me whether I've given him his medicine, if he's been fed, etc (the common things parents take care of with their children).  He caught a bug from a playmate, and she is now sick.  She told me today that if his playmates are sick, that I need to keep HER in mind and not let my son play with them (they had no symptoms of sickness when we were together last week), and that she can't afford to get sick (she buys expensive supplements to make her "feel" better), that my husband needs to take better care of himself and not get sick, and that with my son being on so many antibiotics in his first year that we need to be careful (he's had amoxicilin and Zithromax due to bad ear infections, 2 times each).  I told her that the kids had no signs of illness and that he's only had 2 antibiotics and that he is just fine.   My deal is, how the heck do I get her to butt out.  I can't control when and how often he gets sick.  For peets sake, he is a baby and babies get sick.  With my next one coming, I don't want to have to deal with all the "advice" from her.  I tell my husband that we need to get out of the situation (we are newly married, but have been together for 4 years) and I am told that if we are to leave his mother will be on the streets.  I don't know what to do.  I will not leave my husband, but if something doesn't change I am going to lose my mind...      Oh, and I have plans to see my mom on her day off next week, and she doesn't want me to go because:   1. Kenneth may still be sick   2. She has to go to the Drs. and doesn't want to leave the house empty due to her paranoia (she thinks the cop is going to break in).      ARGHH!  I need some sound advice to either make the situation work or how to get out of the situation without hurting the relationship I have with my husband.   Thank you for your answers / advice.

Lately I've been trying to get my confidence up, and it seems like just when I start to feel good about myself, I'll remember some insult that someone said to me, it doesn't matter how long ago.  Like from girls I've had a few comments about my nose, that I look anorexic (I'm not, just naturally thin) and a few other just not so nice comments about either me in general or my looks.  I know people are gonna say focus on the compliments, and I have had people say I'm really pretty and stuff, but it's hard to focus on those especially when I feel like I don't get much guy attention or guys asking me out.  Help please?  I just want to feel good about myself and comfortable in my own skin. :)  I'm    in year 12, high school, if that makes any difference.

20090220123047AAMJ0T7	Family & Relationships;Weddings	+1 on invitations? Question...?	We're having very small wedding; would like to keep it under 40 people.      My question is this:      Several of our friends are 'professional daters' if you will, and although they never have a significant other for any length of time, seem to always have someone they are 'kinda seeing'.      Is it required to send these peoples' invitations '+1' ? Or should a +1 only be for those in serious relationships?

20090203041715AATDNZF	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What is wrong with me?	I am a 15 year old girl.  Academically I am quite successful (top end of a grammar school) and I do loads of drama and ballet.  I am not the most popular person at school but I am not really disliked by anybody but guys seem to take no notice of me whatsoever.  Is it because I am not pretty enough because if it isn't I don't know why i am ignored.  What am i supposed to do to be noticed or appreciated because i am at a loss.  If any guys are reading this do you always only look at the pretty girls or do you look for other things like intelligence or talent?  Do guys always prefer really skinny girls?

But my FSIL and I both got engaged within 3 weeks of each other and our weddings are going to be within 3 months. She is getting married first, but I got engaged first. Recently my FH and I found a church we really like and now she has decided she hates all the churches except the one we want. It just seems kind of annoying after she has copied us on EVERYTHING. And getting married within a few months of each other I feel like now his family is going to be like "Oh just another wedding at that church" when we get married. I'm really angry about it and I don't quite know what to do...there isn't really much I can do without being a b**ch. Am I justified in feeling this way?

If your dad dies or is just gone and your mom gets a boyfriend that yells and screams and calls her kids names...and drinks and is drunk all the time...and hits the kids mom and makes her cries all day...then he has to go to jail forever.   Then he can never, ever, ever, never get out to hurt the family..then the real dad has to come back home the way it was before.      i think we need this law

Okay so i've been going to my school for 4 years now, everybody in my year knows me as, well, the 'quiet' guy. I've sort of well come out of my shell this year and started to try and talk to people, make some friends etc. But, based on how everybody knows me already, it's not working too well. I attempt to make some small talk with anyone I can find, but they finish it up quickly, and go back to whatever they were doing with their 'group' of friends. I know it's not what i'm saying/my technique of delivery or whatever else you may think. Does anyone have any tips on what I can do/should do?      Thanks.

20090203030937AACvsZm	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why not let females be the husbands and males the wives for the next 100 years?	Why not let females be husbands for next say 100 years?  Now that we know that genders are equal, and that there is nothing in a name    why not let females be the husbands and males the wives for the next 100 years    In short.. why not recognise males as females and females as males, and keep the rest the same.

20090203030004AAWlh9m	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How to resolve argument with my bf regarding pregnancy?? (im not, just a what if)?	Ok so my boyfriend and I have been going out a year and recently had this huge argument about pregnancy. Out of the blue he asked me what i would do if i got pregnant. As i dont really believe in abortion unless its for the best of the baby/mothers health (this is just for me, dont judge others decision) i said that if i did not want to keep it/didnt feel i could provide for the child then i would adopt it out. I also said that of course I would talk to him about it heaps as it would also be his child. But it turned into this huge argument because he said he wasnt ready to be a father (even if it was adopted out) and would want me to have an abortion. To clarify, i am on a contraceptive pill which i take religiously and if we are concerned we also use condoms at times (i.e after ive had a virus).   So my question, anyone know why he would be so concerned when i have assured he there is no way i would want to get pregnant right now. And why not accept that i would do what i thought was best for both of us? i dont get it..

20090203021341AAWkApY	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is it over? Should I forget him and move on? Please advice.?	Hi.. I just wanted to ask your opinion... Im going crazy thinking what to do. HELP!  I met my boyfriend online, although we haven't seen each other we had a great chemistry and i know ours its true. we've been talking online and phone for about 5 months now. He had a vacation to see his family, before he leaves he call me to say bye and he message me once in a while. Since we have time difference i didnt get to answer his message. He said he really misses me and he loves me. Its been over 3 weeks now. But he hasnt message me after I message him. I called his phone and i think he got the call but no one speaks on the other line. I dont know what to do. He works overseas to, and i know he is a very busy man. I just dont know what I did wrong to deserve that treatment. Should I forget him or get over him? Coz clearly he disregards me now. I love him so much that i go crazy without him. But i know I cant do anything for him to stay with me if he doesnt want too. Its just its so hurtful what's he is doing to me. I wish he was brave enough to tell me things is over so I can move on. Its really bugging me, and I keep asking myself what I did wrong to deserve this. Please I just need someone advice.Thanks.
20090220130007AAYTU4z	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What do guys mean by "I can't believe you don't have a boyfriend"?	Okay, before I start.. its defo not a pick up line in this situation, or a slag, lol! Two guys said that ti me in the same week. The thing is, I just want to keep my life simple, and that is why I'm not seeing anyone. I usually hang out with guys rather than girls, for some reason I'm more comfortable around them. I'm not a hottie, lol, basically I look just like my avatar xD      So what do they mean?? Like, the last day on MSN, my friend was talking to me and said that. He said I'm really cool and it just doesn't make sense?! Then today, I was outside with a guy and he said the same thing. Its confusing like?! Its like they're giving out to me for not seeing anyone, lol.
20090220122537AAIIy98	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Guys would you be weirded out if a girl did this?	say if you really liked a girl and never had a chance to talk to her, she moved but then moved back in town a year later, you two see each other lock eyes but don't say anything.. few months pass by and she randomly calls you..      Now this is my actual question, would you guys be freaked out if your crush called you EVEN if you didn't give her your number and even if you guys did not speak for a long time.. I don't want him to think im a stalker or anything.. but i feel that I owe it to myself to just tell him, i see him everywhere or people that look like him.. and i just want to tell him and see if this means anything.. I mean for 3 years in high school we had so many chances to say stuff to each other but we didn't.. i am 99 percent sure he liked me.. but im not sure that since i left he hasn't found anyone new.. i mean i saw him about a few months ago he was looking right at me and he had that look on his face like " I miss you" type thing.. (we graduated in 08 btw) then i see this random car that looks EXACTLY like his pull up in my drive way... the doorbell rang for a while lol but i didn't answer it.. but it reminded me of him.. that happened 1 month and a few days ago      so should i just take the risk and call him? and if I do call him what should i say? what happens if his mom, sister or brother pics up??

20090203033209AAc1nvf	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I just want to die! Whats happened i was so happy.?	ITS LONGGGGGGGGGGGGG!!   so dont give me nasty comments please.      I don't wanna kill myself but I really do need help. My ex is making my life HELL. When he broke up with me (cos I found it hard to trust him cos he LIED before we got together) he promised he'd still always be there for me   & that he doesn't want another gf. But we ended up as mates just always having sex (STUPID!) & then me arguing with him because he started flirting with other girls & texting dirty things to them. & now he's close to some girl "friend" even though they both insist nothing is going on it still hurts so much that they're so close so soon & no doubt they will fall inlove! & he cut off all contact with me blocking me from his myspace (then adding loads of blondees with big boobs & in ther undies, which might mean he's not really into this "friend" of his??) & he deleted me off msn, but not off his phone. I don't use msn & myspace much I've grown out of it. But even cutting off all contact doesn't help because we go to the same college & at some point I will see him & usually I see him drivingg off from college with his new girl "pal".       Oh & he's been spreading stuff like I constantly text him sayin I LOVE YOU and that I wana S**K HIM SLOW & DEEP! & tells everyone that I'm a psycho bunnyboiler..      How childish!!   I've only ever texted him saying that I wana talk & be civil & that I do still love him but will leave him alone if we can just be civil.      Now I'm not bothering. But I feeeeel so horrible. Nothing anyone says can help, My college tutor said see the counsellor, I can't talk to my mum & dad & my friendssss are probably sick & tired of it all!      I just want my life to be over.   Valentines day is so sooon & I was looking forward to it. Now I'm just gonna be alonee & no matter what I do its gonna be horrible & no doubt he will be with his new girl "pal" just as "friends".      Why has he done this hurting me sooo much & making me jealous & saying lies about me. We're 18 for godsake not 12!      I'm not even bad, I mean I'm slim & not really ugly although I feel it, & I like to think I'm mature & nice & I was a fun gf I did EVERYTHING, i mean EVERYTHING.       Why is he such a W**KER & WHYY DO I STILL LOVE HIM!!!!

20090203030159AAUQYJS	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	For the Guys: Could I get your opinions?	Ladies opinions are welcome, too!       All serious answers, please. Best answer will be chosen by me, not voters.       My boyfriend and I have been together for over a year now, and things are going great between us. He's a wonderful man and he treats me better than anyone I've ever known. He spoils me, actually.       My question is this. I'd like to do something for him. Something special (not in the bedroom as we have no problem there ;)). I need something good, whether it be something just for him to go off and do on his own, or something we can do together. But I want it to be something that will touch him and let him know just how much I appreciate him and love him.       Being a woman, my first thought was of candle light and soft music but I know not all men would enjoy this. My man, well.. he's not exactly what you'd call a super romantic. He loves music (especially), and football and basketball. He also loves video games as well (being almost 30, it's endearing lol. Thank God it's not too much.). He's an avid boater and enjoys golf every so often. So now that you know a little about him, maybe you could give me a few ideas from a male perspective?       Oh, and money really isn't an object. But I'd like it to be something personal and thoughtful.       Thanks in advance!

20090220122951AAOUxvY	Family & Relationships;Friends	Who's responsibility is it to confront?	I'm good friends with my ex who I very recently broke up with.    I've started to notice that the drummer in my band might possibly have feelings for her. Neither my ex nor I are 100% sure, but we both sense it. She is not really interested in him that way, and I am not really ready for the drama and awkwardness that would cause.       One of our "rules" during our breakup is to get out more with friends and not hang out with each other as often. She and my drummer are hanging out this weekend alone. She's feeling weird now because we both have seen the signs that he wants more.      Who should be the one to step up and say something? Should she tell him she notices something and is not interested since it's her that he might be attracted to? Should I say something because I am the band member and it was through me that they met? Should we not say anything at all until things become more apparent, since maybe we aren't even right to think he likes her that way?

20090220121748AAE9okD	Family & Relationships;Family	My house isn't... safe anymore. At least not with my brother. Please read Idk what to do anymore?	Sure most kids feel that way and they don't like having to live under their parents rules but I have a real reason.      I've caught my brother more than once doing inappropriet things towards me. It's usually when he thinks I'm asleep or when I'm in the shower.    He used to put an actual camera in the bathroom but I found ways to get out without the camera being able to see me.    I showed my mom the camera but he convinced her that there was no tape and he was just kidding around. All she said was "If your going to joke around with her like that wait until she gets out of the shower."       So he stopped for a while.    Then he got a laptop with a camera in it. He must have thought I was stupid because he left it in the bathroom a lot and, again, I found ways to get out without being completely naked.    Then I told my dad and he convinced my dad that he couldn't afford the actual camera thing on his computer which made absolutely no sense but my dad belived him.   Now every once in a while I'll wake up with my door wide open when I know I closed it.    And a few times I could literally feel him touching me.       It's really gross and I don't know what else to do. I know that if I go to my parents they still wont believe me. My only other solution would be to find some other place to stay.    Is there anything else I can do? It's not safe here anymore and I'm really lost.

20090203041556AAlU8Z1	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Can I still get my ex back ? ?	Okay so me and my boyfriend ( now ex) were dating for 5 months, almost 6 months. He was acting weird for almost a week and last night he told me he though it was best if we broke up. He said he still loved me but that I deserved better...and that he doesnt wanna be with me anymore. Our relationship was soo good, we had amazing times together and i really believe we loved each other. Yeah we did have our hard times but we were able to fight for the love we felt. And its like all of a usdden he is done trying. I want to know if it is possible for me to make him realize that it was a mistake and that he should be with me ? Can i get him back ? and if so...how ?   I really care about him, im in love with him and i would do absolutely everything to get him back. For some reason i believe he still wants to be with me....but im not sure. He wants to keep my stuff ( pictures, etc) at his house still. Any tips or comments would be appreciated. thanks alot !!       By the way he is an aries and I am an aquarius.      Yesterday I went over to his house cuz he wanted me to come over so w could talk about the breakup in person. We cried and talked and blah blah. Then he said this " I dont even know what im doing" ( meaning breaking up with me), "im just stupid". I told him that if he did the right thing for himself he shouldnt have to worry, and im willing to go through the pain if its whats best for him. He said " but its not the best for me i think".   So now im confused, but i left his house, and he called me on my way home, and we havent talked since...So i dont know what to make of all this.   Then 2 days later, we talk on the phone for hours, same again with last night. Although we went all saturday without talking.    I want to make him see that breaking up was a mistake...i have a feeling he regrets it but wont admit it.
20090203014643AArz0Re	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How do I pick up the pieces?	I am American, and I have been living in England now pretty much fully since I was 9 years old (now 27).  I met and married my soon to be ex-husband in 2002, and we had a son in 2003.  I finally admitted to him the other night that I was no longer in love with him, and now after a few days of being in limbo about what to do, we have both decided it's for the best to seperate.      I'm planning on going back to the states, and we have agreed that it would be in our son's best interests to stay in the UK so he has the opportunity to have a better education (I would be moving to New Mexico, the second to last worst educated state in the U.S.).  We also agreed that if he wasn't getting on here, he could come live with me in America, and also when he turns 12 we're going to give him the choice to either stay in the UK or come to the states to go to High School.      It's hard, because he is my best friend in the whole world, and it is also hard knowing that I am leaving my son behind.  He will come visit me in the summer's during school holidays, and also every other Christmas.  I am also planning on coming over to visit on the off Christmases and whenever I can afford it really.      My husband and I don't own any property, unless you count the stack of bills we have on either side of the pond.  We decided that he will take care of the ones in England and I will take care of the ones in the U.S.        I suppose what I'm asking is, how do I pick myself up again and move on with my life?  How do I start caring about myself first again?  Does anyone have any advice on any of the issues I've put here?      Please, I don't really want to hear any bull from people just after a point, I'd really like to get some genuine advice from maybe someone who has experienced something similar.      Thanks

Mixed emotiaons about friends, family, school and life.      Why does everyone want to be emo? well not want to be. But dress emo, and dye there hair black; by doing this they then clam themselves as emo. They probably dont even cut themselfs.      Who has a logical explanation as to why someone would want to be emo? [fake emo]?      I hate posers.      {second repost}

20090203025346AAMHBw4	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does my boyfriend want to get engaged?	My boyfriend and I have been together for almost a year and we are both 22. I've never been so happy and in love in my life. A few weeks ago we spent a few days in Paris, and everybody assumed that he was going to propose to me - which I knew he wasn't because he got scared every time someone mentioned it! We had an amazing time in Paris and are closer than ever before and since we got back, he's spoken about engagement more openly, he doesn't change the subject, we've been shopping a couple of times and each time we pass a jewelers he drags me into it, saying we should look at rings 'for a laugh'. He tells me that I should have a really nice one. What should I make of this? Him proposing to me would be the best thing I could ever wish for but I don't want to build up my hopes.
20090220122117AAPJVOP	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What do I do about my wife's flirty friends?	My wife has a couple of girlfriends she works with.  Both of them are in miserable crummy marriages and they are terribly unhappy.  Once in a while we (me and the three girls) go out dancing.        While we are out there, the other girls are beyond flirty with me.  While my wife doesn't mind I find it a little creepy.  I mean yes it's flattering but I just wonder if these girls would act that way for their husbands, maybe people would be happier.. you know?      I mean we all have fun...  One of them is pretty convinced about my wife's and my "openness" in our marriage and my wife is convinced it's because she wants to "borrow" me, which I would NEVER do...       What is the polite way to deal with this?  I don't mind being slightly flirty but I hate playing a role of fulfilling a need that they are missing from their husbands.

Anyway, my dad works out of town a lot and has been gone for 2 weeks, he just got home yesterday. i came home from school about an hour ago and he had gone in my room while i was gone and completely moved around EVERYTHING and messed it all up. he unplugged my laptop and moved the plug to the other side of the room, and i was working on a paper on it yesterday and it shut off and i have to start all over now. :(   i can't find half of my shoes.   ugghhh its all messed up. i keep my room decent, and even if it doesnt look spotlessly clean to everyone i know where everything is. i'm so angry right now, he does this the first day he got back for god knows what reason and now i have to eventually fix everything again and REDO the first 4 pages of my research paper. :(      i just really need to get out of the house right now so i dont start yelling or something. i need to relax/ do something fun, but i'm a little too upset to hang out with friends tonight.      should i see a movie? go shopping? eat out for dinner? i need something to do that will take a couple of hours so that by the time i get back i'll have calmed down.. though i'm afraid my dad will mess it up more while i'm gone... oh well. thanks.

I recently moved to another town far from him, I no longer feel that vibe that was there btween us and communication from his side is punctuated at times. I went to see him after a while away from him but to my surprise he seemed a little shy and when it came to making luv, his erection was weak, he lost it a number of times. We talked about it and he said he doesnt know why it happened to him. At times I feel like we are drifting apart. Is it the distance or what could be lacking?

20090220135155AAAcqIR	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Can anyone give me some good advice here?	Something has been bothering me lately about my boyfriend of two years. He is always making comments on how I always watch tv shows that just bring you down like intervention, or I like to watch 20/20, and murder mysteries because it is just my thing. I like to learn about how mysteries get solved and it is interesting to me. It's not like I am this dark person who wants to watch murders. Anyways, I was watching Intervention the other day and its a show about people who are either on drugs or that have a disorder and their family brings in someone to intervene on their behalf. Now I like this stuff because I am studying to be a licensed clinical social worker and basically I will be working with people who have substance abuse issues and mental health disorders so this stuff interests me. Anyways, I was watching it and he was like "why do you have to watch this stuff it just brings you down" and he is the type of guy who never takes anything seriously and always likes to watch comedy which is fine because I like comedy too but why can't he respect what I like to watch? Why does he have such an issue with it?

20090220122206AAWkfQr	Family & Relationships;Family	What can I do about my sister who steals from me?	My sister is 18 and she has a serious problem. She not only steals from me but also from my parents. She has stolen hundreds of dollars from me in clothes. She also stole my digital camera and sold it, to a friend I'm assuming. (I checked local pawn stores). I no longer keep cash on me because she always steals it. She has stolen numerous gift cards as well. She takes my mom's credit cards and uses them and then puts them back. This morning, I had the last straw when I walked out to my car and found my debit card laying on the ground beside my door. I knew that it didn't magically fall out of my wallet AND out of my purse. I immediately got online and checked my account and saw that she used it at a gas station this morning. My mom called her and she said she swore she didn't take it. Then finally my mom had told her she was going to go to the gas station and have them pull the tapes and report it as credit card fraud. My sister admitted to taking it and said that she was so sorry but her car would barely even start because it didn't have any gas. My mom keeps threatening to send her to counseling but never follows through. I HATE my sister. I'm sick of it! What can I do?????
20090220122523AAHAsXx	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	My wife keeps losing weight, and attractiveness...?	OK, basically my situations is this.  My wife and I have been married about 1 1/2 yrs, and we were together for about a year before that.   We have a 1 yr old baby together and I am having a problem with the amount of weight she has lost since the pregnancy.  She was never a fat person, though she was not as thin as she wished she was.  I would say an honest 5'3" 135 lbs... Now she is currently about 105 lbs soaking wet.  I know she is happy w/ her wight loss, but I am now noticing that I am no longer attracted to her physically.  The image I had of her before the loss is what I fell in love w/ and now it is gone.. I understand that a woman's body goes through changes after having a baby and I do feel selfish for feeling this way, but it's hard.  Very simple things like cuddling are becoming troublsome when all I feel is her bones digging into me or when I look at her face and her cheeks are sunken in.   I have dropped hints of my dislikes and again feel guilt for this, but I don't know what to do.  I am afraid this is a peg that is being driven inbetween us and our relationship will suffer and eventually fall apart.  Lately I have not even felt stimulated enough to make love to her, and have emotionally withdrawn to prevent any misleading that I may be interested.  How can I communicate this w/ her so she understands and doesn't hate me for it?

20090220123007AAKoHDA	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Help me I've fallen for my male best friend, but we are both married, should I tell him?	We have been best friend for many years, lost touch and recently found each other.  I've since realized I have fallen so deeply in love with him.  I love my husband, but am not "In Love" with him, haven't been in years.  I KNOW he has feelings for me, but not sure how deep beyond friendship.  I don't know how he feels about his wife either.  She is the only thing other than my love for him we have not talked about.  We used to love each other so much years ago, but never dated for reasons unkown to either of us. We both say we wish we had though.  He is all I think about now and I'm going crazy.  I look at him and still see the younger, gorgeuos, sexy him I used to know, he looks great.  He is the kindest, sweetest man who I know would give his life for me and I'd do the same for him.  Should I tell him how I feel or just try to get over it?  How can I get over it?  He's so perfect.  Thank you in advance for helping!

Should I give her space and time to think this over and calm down, ( that's what I did last time she said bye, and it worked) or should I continue to argue my case? I have always said I'm here if you want me.

20090220130737AAFi8aG	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I poured my heart out now what?	I am in my late 20’s and have been with this guy for 6 months. He is divorced with no kids. He asked me out almost 6 months after the divorce was finalized but we had worked together for over a year (it was all platonic). After dating for about a month he had to work in a different state but we talked on the phone every day. He came back and we would go out on dates after about 2 months he told me he loved me. He knows I have problems expressing my feelings and has been patient with me. His job keeps him on the road but we talk every day I only get to see him about once every 2 months. Since I have trouble expressing my feelings in person and over the phone I decided that for his birthday this past week I would send him an email where I poured my heart out telling him I was in love with him that I missed him and what it was about him that I loved and missed but I have not heard from him in two days. All my friends say I did the right thing by telling him exactly what my feelings for him are but now I’m not too sure I did the right thing. By the way this is my first real relationship that has lasted more than a month or so and this is the first time that I have ever told a guy exactly how I felt. I have been crying for the past two days wondering if I should I have done things differently?        Left wondering in the USA

We are flat out doing it once a fortnight and it usually seems to happen when he intitiates it. I do dress sexy, drop hints, walk around naked, whisper naughty thing, offer him whatever he wants but it doesn't usually work out. Do you have any suggestions for how I can get him in the mood? I've spoken to him before about and he agrees that he does have a low libido and will make more of an effort. I just want it at least once a week - is that too much to ask!!!

I knoo my bf isn't commited to this relationship   But I don't care too much.   I'm having sex with my best friend tomorrow..

What r ur thoughts?
20090203025537AAj1tZp	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	He said that he likes me...How should I take this situation?	I've never really been in a relationship before, and I have never had a guy like me. He said that he likes me and I was all shocked, because I've never had another person, another soul or being, like me.,   Now, I'm unsure about my feelings toward him..      He doesn't know my age, because I DO NOT tell people my age.    He's 19, and I really like how he's good with his twin baby siblings, and he is so sweet, and mature but with a good sense of humor. He's all mellow and laid back, but expressive. He makes me smile. And I think he's amazing.      I've never had a guy my age like me, which is why I prefer older and more mature men.      I believe that I should share my feelings only with the person I will be married too. But ever since he came into my life, I'm having second thoughts.      This isn't about sex, or about liking someone for 8 months, or about making others jealous, or about bragging about boyfriends...    This is a decision that will cause a life changing experience for me, this is about me finding someone I want to share everything with. Regardless of age. And staying together until we become one, Until I have a spiritual bond with one man out of the other 4 billion. Finding my soul mate. Finding Love, Holding onto it with all of my being and all that it's worth.         Now, I may be young, but feelings don't have an age.   So, should I like him back?    Any advice, from adults?   or people with experience?       ;)

What are the causes that instil this kind of attitude in their nature? Is it the way their parents raised them? Or past experiences?  Is there a lable for this kind of behaviour?

20090203031414AAWhrLy	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	At what age are guys at their dating prime and appear more attractive?	I have realised that for girls, the younger and better looking they are, the more attention they get from guys, so it is only logical to put a girls dating -prime as between 18-22yrs, (women dont get offended here, i maybe wrong..i am 22yrs by the way) but it seems with guys it is different, boys dont appear (sexually) attractive to girls until they begin to develop more masculine features, and i am not talking about at puberty, but at later ages of about 23/24yrs....i may be wrong, and that is why i am curious to find out if girls too consider guys to be most attractive  within a particular age range....and why? thanks for answering (and could you please state how old you are in your answer?).

20090203033310AAlOpYj	Family & Relationships;Friends	I was intimate with my friend and now he won't talk to me, why?	First, I would like to say that your advice is much appreciated and please don't judge me.  I met this guy 7 months ago and we became dear friends--entrusting each other with alot of personal info. in our lives. I have been in a relationship for the past 13 years and I am only 27. So, yes, this has been my only relationship. I love this man with all my heart, but he has disappointed me time and time again. I have communicated this with him and tried to make it right.  I shared this info. with my friend (he shared much of his life with me as well). My friends is younger than I |(only 23).I am female and he is male.  I began to question his feelings for me--wondering if they were more than freindship. I began to feel this way when he seemed to have more of an interest in my relationship than other parts of my life. Also, friends began to say, "Wow, he really likes you." Even strangers who didn't know us would make such comments. I called him on this and he denied it saying we were just friends and that's it.  However, to complicate this more...we kissed one night in his car and than became even more intimate the next day. We did not have sex, but we were very intimate. I would also like to say that the occurance seemed much more meaningful than a horny (excuse my lang.) romp. He rubbed my hand, kissed my forehead, held me oh so tight. Everything from the way we kissed to the way we touched was very intimate and comfortalbe. When it was over, he acted as if he was confused. I felt like he couldn't figure out if you wanted me to go or stay--it was wierd! Since, I have text him twice, he responded very casually. I sent him an e-mail, but have heard nothing in response.  He has made no attempts to contact me or see me. This has hurt me in a big way. I never thought he would act this way and just discard of me and our friendship. Why is he doing this????????? Please any advice is appreciated.

20090203035824AAumkTr	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Love on xbox live. Any advise?	Well, a few months ago, a friend of mine introduced me to someone on xbox live. Now just about everyday she talks to me, and we have become very good friends. However, there are times when i think she wants to be more than friends.   Even though i think that is very sweet, and i do have some feelings for her, i really don't agree with online dating, for multiple reasons.   One major problem is our age, i am 2 years older than her (i'm 14, she is about to be 12), and i'm sure her parents wouldn't like that.  So even though my heart says i should accept her, my common sense is telling me that we shouldn't be more than friends.  I really don't want to ruin her life, weather its by making her rebel against her parents just to talk to me, or by breaking her heart.    I really don't know what to tell her, or how i should be feeling. Does any of you who have similar experiences be able to give me some advise?     And yes, i know online dating is dangerous. Please don't lecture me on that, because this is a little bit different.

20090203040010AA4IfQ9	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Invite old high school "friends" to our wedding?	My fiance and I are a little stuck in choosing who to invite and who not to invite to our wedding. He has basketball "friends" from elementary-high school, but only talks to a few of them now. He just talks to a few of them on a regular basis and the others he only sees when they all get together to play basketball together again, which is not that often..maybe every several months or so. So, he just feels that inviting some guys from his old team that he still talks to and not inviting the others would be rude or upset those not invited since they all used to kind of hang out as a group. He doesn't necessarily want all the guys to be there, he just doesn't want to offend anyone since the ones that aren't invited will surely hear about the wedding. Also, one of these guys (who actually told my fiance a couple years ago that he wants to be at our wedding when it happens) is just an icky guy, I don't like him much at all. And in high school he was always saying things to my fiance about other girls and if he wants to dump me for them! So I don't really want him there, but my fiance would feel bad since this guy actually mentioned he wants to be at our wedding, I don't know what to do! We are on a tight budget and can't afford to invite all our "friends" from high school that we haven't talked to for about 2 years now. Should he invite all his old basketball team members, or just the ones he still has a relationship with that goes beyond playing b-ball together every six months or so and comments every once-in-a-while on myspace?       Also, should I invite my "friend" that I haven't seen since high school grad parties and haven't talked to for about a year and half now? We became friends in 6th grade but once 9th grade came our friendship wasn't that strong and by the end of high school we had little in common. I tried calling her since high school after she moved for college and talked to her a couple times when she actually answered but I got sick of being the only one making an effort to stay in touch. So, now I haven't heard from her, or most of my other "friends", from high school in a year and a half. I feel I am not obligated to invite her, but I still wonder if I should. What do you think about this big mess? sorry this is so long.. I have a lot on my mind! Thanks!

20090203040711AAECabT	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	My husband constantly talks to other females. Should I leave?	am thinking about separating from my husband. We have been married 7 yrs and have 2 daughters, 6 and 1. We have had many problems, but the main one is him talking to other females on the phone. I don't mind him having female friends most of whom are coworkers. But he calls them all the time on a daily basis and tells me stories of them sleeping with other women's men. Tonight I checked his phone tonight(i hate doing it) and I saw where he called this new coworker right after I left for work. The other day he was talking to her when I called him and he lied and said he was talking to his brother. We have been going through this for years and I don't want to go into another year like this. Should I go? I don't know what to do. My heart is telling me to go before we start hating each other.

I really want the bridesmaids to mirror my own dress in style and fabric, strapless, wrapped, flowy satin-ish. I only have 2 bridesmaids (my sisters) and they are both tall and sort of lanky, so I'm not so concerned about bulging or shape concerns.

20090220134523AAwBsKl	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How do I  transition out of a relationship?	I have been with my SO for 5 years. We are unmarried, but do share a daughter. I have come to a point of belief that there is no chance of happiness in this relationship. I have not been truly happy in years. I know the transition will be hard. I do still love him, but am not in love anymore. I won't miss the sex because that is rare. I think I have figured out all the things we need to discuss regarding property and joint custody, but if anyone has suggestions to make this an easier transition, please share. Our daughter is 3, so I know it will be somewhat difficult to explain to her, but hopefully her transition will not be too difficult.

20090220141053AAQ7lh9	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Why wear white??????	First off, I have nothing against wearing white on your wedding day.        Ok, that said, why do most people think you're "supposed" to wear white on your wedding day?  I know it's traditional and most of the dresses out there are white and all that, but there are more and more colored dresses being made these days.  Why is it so bad to wear a non white dress?      Sorry, this is not an anti white or pro non white wedding dress campaign or anything.  I just realized I might be coming off that way.  It's just that something's been baffling me for the past week.  Last week I finally picked out my dress, I found "the one" and it happens to be pink.  I always assumed I would be wearing white, now I don't even know why.  But my friend saw the pink dress and wanted me to try it on.  As soon as I saw myself in the mirror, I knew that was the one I want.      Now I don't plan on telling very many people about the pink dress because I want everyone to be surprised.  In fact I've only told my parents, fiance, and FMIL.  But each one of them looked at me really funny when I said that the dress is pink, like I had three heads or something.  I thought my fiance was going to crap a brick when I told him.  At the end of the day I don't care if people think it's gay, because I march to the beat of my own drummer sometimes, but it just got me thinking when they all ask "why pink?", I say "why white?"

20090220121659AAGHerY	Family & Relationships;Family	Family problems?????????	Heres some things you should know about me first:   I am 15 years old, I live in Gary, Indiana (Just moved here), and I am 100% Indian.      Family problem:   Everybody on my dads side of my family hates my mom and her side of the family. My dad doesn't hate anyone on my moms side its just that each time they make fun of her he doesn't stand up to help her. My mom ends up crying and this has been happening for as long as i can remeber. My dad is like to scared or to nervous to do anything, im the only one who is the leader in my family since i was 10. I was the only one for years to stand up for my mom, and yesterday they got into a fight, i started screaming at my dad because he got me mad, because he was saying he did try to help my mom when she was in a depression because of his side of the family. And yesterday his side of the family came over (I don't consider my dads side family) and i was all angry that he brought them over, his grandma started tomake fun of my mom, and id didn't want my mom to feel hurt so i screamed at my dads mom and told to to Shut the hell up!. She told me stay out of it. And I said Theres no way in hell you are going to tell me what to do!. And then one of my dads nephews (same age as me) came into the room and pushed me, so i turned around and punched him in the jaw and before i know it he was crying on the floor and his two brothers came and tried to jump me, then my friends came out of my basement (we were lifting) and threw them of me, and someone punched me and i fell back and hit my head on a radio and i was blacked out for a half an hour or so, when i woke back up my mom was crying and my friends were trying to help her. I got up to see if my dads family was still there, but they were not. It turns out they came to tell my dad that his dad died. He was crying too, but i just didn't care. Whats your opnion on this whole dilemma? I need sme advice and help. I have two younger brothers and i don't want them to get involved with my dads side of the family.
20090220145658AAYkiBq	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	No Judgements. I need help deciding what to do.?	I am married to a good man, but he doesn't know how to treat me very well.  He drinks too much and is emotionally abusive sometimes.  We hardly ever have sex, but he wants to have a baby with me. And my doctor said he needs to quit smoking and drinking to help with that.  I feel like he doesn't pay attention to me or want anything to do with me. He says it's not me, but he doesn't know what it is. I've tried making it work.  Before I met him 2 years ago, I dated this guy for a while, but I moved away so the relationship didn't work out.  Now in weird circumstances we started talking again, and he's moving to a place not too far from me.  The thing is, I want to leave my husband, but I can't because I'd have to drop out of school and move back with my parents in another state. I still have really deep, really serious feelings for the other guy.  I'm considering cheating on my husband, and other than the whole u will go 2 HELL!!!!1111 argument, I can't think of a reason why not.  Do I just need attention or something?      No judgements please.

How do you deal with the constant lack of respect and intrusion of personal space and marriage! I live with my husband and his parents and we have two children. At this time we cannot afford to live on our own. His parents say that they want us to live with them and they wouldnt have it any other way. We pay them rent and utilites, and keep the house clean. Unfortunately, lately, they have been interfering with the way we are raising our children, and telling us how and when to spend our money, and they get angry if my husband spends any money on me. for instance, he brought me flowers yesterday and they told him he was wasting his money.

As it says in the title-   my husband and I are pregnant, currently expecting our first child to be born anyday now...   I was actually due to give birth on Monday, but I had a feeling that I'd be overdue      My husband has a very stressful job   and we are very fortunate that he gets paid paternity leave after the baby is born   so that should help with the transition      however, in the mean time,   its getting to be a bit much for both of us   I find myself feeling out of control- crying, sleeping...but that's to be expected   I'm hormonal, I can deal with my own craziness...   and it helps that my husband has been so understanding and so supportive throughout the entire pregnancy      what I'm really worried about is my husband   he's just so stressed out   I've had a couple incidents of false labor   (once with contractions lasting 9 hours at 10 minutes apart)   and of course the false labor is making him even more worried      we have excellent communication   and we talked about all of this...   but neither of us really knows how to help him through this...      it will be at least another week before we consider inducing labor,   but hopefully something will just happen naturally before then...      anyone else been there?   any ideas on how to help him stay relaxed while we're both just waiting?

My mom recently moved out (I posted a question about divorce before, this is totally different so bear with me)   anyway, she said it's cos she couldn't live with my father any more, I couldn't see why, because if you knew him, you would see he was the sweetest most gentle guy ever, seriously, ever.   any way, I was shocked to find a domestic violence card in my moms purse, and i know she's on prozac (anti depressant pills) and that she gets counselling now.   HERE'S THE MAIN POINT OF THE QUESTION:   I shouldn't of but, about 20 mins ago i found a file on microsoft word about the divorce, and I read things about my dad which makes me feel sick, I had no idea he was like this, i'm still literally shaking, i'm that shocked, its disgusting how he treat her physically but also financially.   Thing is, I live with him, and he treats me to things a lot more now etc, but I'm now having second thoughts, am I safe? should I live with my mom now? I don't know how to cope knowing all of this, it's like the most shocking news I have heard in my life...   idk how to cope, I hope at least a couple of you answer, if you have read this Q. then kudos to you! I really need advice.   I'm 16 btw.

20090220124019AA4VSuX	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Slightly confused about her behavior...?	So this past weekend I spent sometime with my ex, it was only one night but it was fun. We made dinner and dessert and drank some wine and just talked all night long. She lives in another city and I was nearby visiting my parents. We talked a lot and asked each other about dating and we both said we had but nothing had come of our experiences, she also told me about a guy she had been talking to in the city we used to live in but then told me nothing was going to happen out of it. She told me this quite a few times throughout the night. I told her it didnt bother me and she had to do what she had to do. Later on she grabbed my phone and  started to go through it and she handed me hers and told me I could go through it. I didnt go through hers because I didnt care too.       I ended up staying the nite but we didnt sleep in the same bed for friendship reasons. But before she went to bed she ran into my room and jumped on top of me and gave me a huge hug good night. The next morning she came into the room to wake me up and she was completely naked. Not a big deal to me as I have seen her before (3 yr relationship) and told me i needed to come take a shower and get ready for the day. Mind you she has 2 bathrooms in her place. So I did and that was that. She gave me a huge hug and told me she had a fantastic time and was looking forward to seeing me in a couple weeks. I am going back to visit her for the weekend.      This my seem like what she is saying here is obvious but its not so much, she tells me one thing and acts another way. I want to get back together with her, and I believe we can we just havent talked about it at all. We broke up 2 months ago.      What do you think she means by all this?

20090220130006AALXPNY	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do i tell if she likes me?	I'm fifteen and in ninth grade, and i realized about two years ago that I'm bisexual.    about a week ago, i met this girl. And i've been talking to her every day since then. I've realized that I like her. She knows I'm bi; and i kinda think she might be, too.  she dresses a bit boyish; and she did date a girl in eighth grade; but of course, it's possible she could be straight now.      In my opinion, she acts like she likes me. She does and says little things that are so cute to make me laugh, and she stares at me and smiles when i notice. and she always comes to talk to me when she sees me, even when her friends are somewhere else.       Today, i was leaving and she said "i know you're not going to just walk away". she wanted a hug :D          how do i really tell if she likes me?

20090220145555AAJlc8V	Family & Relationships;Family	My nephew wants more money?	He's been round scrounging money again. I usually don't mind giving it to him - he's my only living relative. I give him an allowance of ￡5,000 per month plus the occasional 'extra' when he needs it.      He wants an extra ￡15,000 this month to have a huge water tank fitted at his property (there is plenty of room) but he has recently watched the film 'Splash' and is deluded that he thinks he can have a mermaid as a pet.       Should I just humour him and give him the money or is it time to put my foot down and say no?

I spoke to him about trying new things in the bedroom  (i.e. oral - both) and he said sure....that was 2 weeks. ago and nothing- I don't usually recommend things in the bedroom - but he has in the past (1 year ago) don't you think he would have jumped at that. I guess I'm left with my normal missionary-  2 x per month sex...yippee.       I know a lot of people will tell me to initiate but I did by asking.  He complained in the past and now he won't put out. I feel like I give to the family 24/7 don't I deserve some care! Also I would like a little more affection at home. He thinks a kiss hello and goodnight is sufficient. I've talked to him before and I'll get a day or two of hugs.  Sorry to sound so demanding but I am 40 and horny!!!

I am having trouble reading the "signs" when it comes to this girl I like. What are some ways to see if she likes you without asking her to be your girlfriend to see? And if you say flirt, in what way, because apparently I flirt without me even knowing.       I know no method is full proof, but I would like to have an idea on where she stands before I ask her to hang out, etc.       Thanks ahead of time!
20090220125614AAnGvL4	Family & Relationships;Family	Am I overreacting about something dumb?	So my dad and his wife just had a baby (my half brother) and sent out birth announcements. In them were pictures of him and then one of him, my dad, and dads wife. That picture was in a homemade frame thing and on it spelled family. Well I wasn't asked to be in that picture and I am his sister. It kinda hurt my feeling because I feel like they don't think of me in part of that family. I love my brother and visit him when I can, but I just feel like I am not wanted. Am I wrong for being mad for not being in the baby announcements? I mean we are 17 yrs apart, but still.

What are his feelings?	i like this guy and i am in most of his classes. he sits in front of me in 2 of the classes and like behind me diagnally in another class. he has had many girlfriends before so yeah, i guess he can be a player. right now i think he's going out with this girl who i just met this year. he went out with her like last month too but then they broke up. anyway todat he said he loved me. i don't know if he means as a friend or more. today when he said it i was like no you don't and he's like i really do with a smile on his face. he has been talking to me more than usual. he always calls my name and when i look over he just stares me in the eye. i have a little cold so i brought cough drops to school. i kept them in my sweatshirt pocket and he kept bugging me for them. he swore that he really had a sore throat so i gave him one but throughout the day he was asking for more. i was saying no because i didnt want to run out. when i was at my locker he ran up and yanked them out of my pocket. i screamed because i felt someone touch me lol and i wasnt looking forward to that. so i kinda like tackled him to get them back [just held his arm to grab the bag] but he had already taken 2. oh and also he asked the teacher to sit next to me a few weeks ago because i said i was lonely but that was before he started going out with this girl. im not the type that tells people i like them although i know i should.       what do you think his feelings are about me?   do you think this will lead into anything?      thanks (:   *thank you so much for reading. i didn;t mean to make it so long D:

20090220124927AALGFrr	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	If you were to design a Barbie, what would she look like? (family)?	I have seen all these topics and stuff about Barbie. If you've never seen Barbie, you really need to get out more often (and look at:  http://www.barbie.com/  )      The opinions are many, her breasts are too big... her neck is too long... if she's so popular, why do you need to buy her friends? Much Barbie-bashing to be had, but here's the real question for all of you.      If you were to design a Barbie doll in the here and now, Mattel came to you to design the next incarnation of the world-famous doll, and you know you would jump at the chance of that! Don't lie and say you would not do it because that's not true. What would she look like? What color hair? What would be her bodily dimensions? Would she be made out of plastic, rubber or some other materials? How long will you make her legs?      Not asking you to design the whole Barbie Universe, just Barbie herself for the new generation.      So... what you got?

20090220112941AAiyN4V	Family & Relationships;Family	Advice on mother who is an enabler for sister?	I've recently been sent a letter from my mother making crazy accusations and making us choose between my dad & her. She has been divorced from my dad for 20 + years, but is recently going through divorce from second husband. Recently there was a horrendous disputer between my sister and my dad and now they've stopped talking. She keeps claiming that my dad is trying to take my sisters child (which would probably be best because my sister is a drug addict). She is acting irrational and sends letters stating things like "You'll never choose my side" or " I deserve respect" or" you can't have your cake & eat it to". She won't allow us to see my niece because she thinks we're conspiring to take her away from her mother(my sister) which is ridiculous! My mother takes her hydrocodone religiously and is taking more everyday to deal with her stress. She puts her needs before others and is willing to raise my 30 yr old sister and her child for the rest of her life. My sister is a "recovering" addict however I don't believe recovering = ingesting drugs. My sister steals from her including money and pain pills and my mom has paid for everything for my sister, cars, apartments, her habit, alcohol and continues to give more. Now my mom is going through a 2nd divorce and nothing we do is right. it seems that no matter what I say she is always finding fault or twisting my words for her selective benefit. Do I need to cut my ties now, but what if my niece needs us? What do I do?
20090220141858AAqVO6m	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Do you think my wife is out of line?	I have a wife who is 20 years younger than me (I'm 40 and she's 20) and we've been together nearly five years. I met her when she was 16 and she was homeless and she came from a really terrible family. She was in a really bad state when I met her, she'd been homeless for a couple of months. At first I just let her stay at my place so she'd have somewhere to sleep, but then we fell in love with each other.      Last year we had a baby together, and since then she's really gone off sex. We've also been arguing a lot, and quite often she goes out after work with friend's and doesn't come back till much later and doesn't even call me to tell me where she is. In arguments she has said it's because she doesn't want to talk to me because she thinks I'm jealous and controlling. A couple of times she's come back really drunk and I think she has taken drugs (I just want to say that this isn't a regular occurance). Also when she was 18 I got a tattoo of her name done on me, and she said that she'd get mine done on her, but now she doesn't want it done. Do you think she's being out of order? What do you think?

I'm like only 13 and my mum has had a mental illness ever since I was born, which makes me feel like it's all my fault. She has been diagnosed with summet to do with Skitzoprenia and is on medication. I've lived with it all my life and I don't think I can take it anymore. She's chubby, never stops eating, has got the IQ of a peanut and smells sometimes as well. I know these are pretty harsh things to say and I know it's not her fault but, I feel like committing suicide. She hears voices and shouts a lot and it scares me sometimes, even though she's got a heart of gold ! I do love her and so does my dad and I can see that he is craking as well. They are having more arguements now and I just want everything to be over. She's been in hospital twice for a good 3 months and I've had to live with my nan in that time. I kinda liked it there though.      Has anyone got a similar problem or has any advice, I need it quick !!!

20090220141552AAihKmi	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Boyfriend/Porn Disagreement: GUYS advice very welcome too?	I've been seeing my boyfriend for awhile now, and things are going great and we've looked at rings and are picking out a place, so everything is moving along great. He's a terrific sweet loving man and I adore him.      But theres one issue Im having problems with. He'd really like us to watch porn together. I have no moral issue with porn (hell, we made one of our own) but watching other people do it just isnt my thing. He says it'd be a good educational experience and would be hot.      My big issue with it is it makes me feel like Im not sexy enough or our sex life isnt hot enough to get him turned on on its own. I've voiced this to him multiple times and he says Im interpreting his desire to watch it with me incorrectly. Im not sure how else to take it. Im also irritated because a few weeks ago this came up and I asked if he was watching it anymore and he said no. Then today hes like "sorry babe I am I guy and I do watch it". When I asked why he told me he wasnt watching it anymore he said "well at the time you asked I wasnt". Caught me on a technicality.      Am I making a big deal out of nothing? Any advice? The whole thing just makes me feel very unsexy and un-needed

20090220141612AA8oUC5	Family & Relationships;Family	My evil grandmother, will my mother ever forgive her?	It all began when my grandmother tried to make my mother into a christian. First of all she tryed everything she could, but soon it got whorse. She began sending letters to convert her to a christian even though she didnt belive in anny god and later she tryed to make my brother and i to christians, by buying christian books with Jesus and bibles. She brainwashed my brother and convinced him that he didnt need to be afraid of dying and he could just go and drown right now, because it didnt matter. She told him sick things like that, but never got that far with me. She doesnt care about my family with me, my brother nor our parents. She wanted my father to divorce and leave us alone. Nether was my dad allowed to have anny friends as little because it should just be family, and you didnt need friends. My mother hates her, but in spite of that she is extremely dumb, she is not exactly sick in her head. My grandmother was extremely christian, she prayed to god if she got a splinter in her finger, but she have calmed down the last years. Grandmother hates my mom, because she's not christian and only cares about all my dads brothers and sister and the rest of the family, but not us. My dad wants to get friend with her again, because he doesn't have anny friends and family is the only closest thing to friends he can ever get. What can i now do, my mom hates her and my dad needs her because of the reasons as said but also because she is the leader of the pack. The rest of the family doesnt like us very much, we never have anny contact with them because of my grandmother and therefore my dad cant do annything with annyone in the family, because no one wants to have annything with us, and that he is very unsocial because of my granny didn't allow him to have anny friends...sick *****. Annyone, please help this has benn for years, soon 20 and my father lives in agony and deep sorrow. Oh, did i say that i got christmas decoration at my birthday or a glue pistol? Now thats how much she cares about me!

20090220141818AAMrKiv	Family & Relationships;Family	My step-son's first communion.?	I don't now how should I handle this. My husband's son is having his first Communion in May. His ex-wife makes a huge deal out of it. The discussions have been going on since November. First of all they do not get along, to say the least and had nasty divorce. I think I can handle watching them walking their son down the aisle together and sitting in the front row together while I am stuck in the back. Though it irritates the hell out of me. Then, she wants us to have a lunch together. Now, you can't pay me enough to sit down at the same table with that *****. First, my husband does not seem to understand why this whole thing is stressful for me. Second, I don't get why she is trying to put on this show of being a family when they can't stand each other? I understand this is important for my step son, whom I love very much. And he is the only reason I can swallow my humiliation and watch this whole thing in church. But how do I handle this "mutual luncheon" thing? Should I let my husband go (that bothers me a lot) and when I told him there is no way I'm ding it he said "Fine I'll cancel everything", which makes me feel guilty, as if i am depriving his son of smth important. And I am really not sure why on Earth she puts all this show on?

20090220142742AAThsZ4	Family & Relationships;Family	Can someone please give me some suggestions on what to do with my son?	My son is 21 years old and he does not work.  He will get a job, be late and irresponsible and loose it.  It has been almost a year and a half since he has held a real job.  I just recently purchased a house which has a guest house in the back.  I rent it to my 23 and 21 year old sons.  My 23 year old son is working consistently and my 21 year old does not work because he got fired from his job since I bought the house in December 2008.  He does not pay any bills because he does not have any money.  I tell him that when I leave in the morning he has to leave too and look for a job.  That lasted for 1 week.  I tell him that he needs to do work around the house.  He will do it but it is half ***.  He is a very respectful young man, he has never talked back to me but the bottom line is that he is lazy and I am very tired of going to work to pay the bills when he is just sitting at home making the bills.  A year ago he was surpose to go to the California Conservation Corps and live there.  My boyfriend a I took him and his girlfriend (she was going too) out to dinner and dropped them off at the Greyhound bus station.  Do you know that as soon as we left the bus station, they left too and went to her mother's house.  I was so angry.  He said that they decided that they could get their lives together here.  He has been back and forth from my house to his girlfriends house every since.  I am so tired and stressed out behind this boy not working and depending on me and his brother paying all of the bills.  I just got in remission from cancer one year ago and I really do not need the stress.  One last thing.   I told him that he needs to weed wack the weed and he did, but as soon as I took off to go to work his friend pulled up, he put away the weed eater and took off to Arizona to accompany his friend with only half of the yard done.  I finished it today but there is absolutely no reason why I should be out there doing any yard work when I go to work and pay most of the bills.  I'm really ready to tell him that he has to go even though he has no where else to go.    Please please can someone give me some suggestions on what to do.

20090220143122AAL41Rg	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do I ask him out? Because I don't usually do that.?	Well there's this guy (let's call him A) and I really like him. I talk to his friend a lot and when I was talking to his friend (let's call him W) he said that A didn't like me. Then the next day when I was at Volleyball he smiled and talked 2 me the whole entire time and he also put his arm around me. (Waist) But then 2day he came up 2 me and asked me, "How do you think of me?" then I kinda froze until he asked again for the second time. Then I said, "Well depends on what you think of me." Then he, "I sort of like you but mostly as a friend." then he said, " But I'll give you a chance." But when I was about to say yes the bell rang and I had to go to another class but it wasn't with him so I didn't get to tell him. Then while I was walking down the hall an 8th grader came up to me and he asked me out and I really didn't know what to say so I said, "I'll think about it." Then walked away but then he kissed me right when A was passing and now A doesn't like me. How do I ask him out now?

20090220151916AAU7nVs	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does she like me (for girls to answer)?	In addition to a few major other points that I recently posted which made people say she liked me, she also acts different when shes with her friends then she does when I just talk to her one on one, and talks to me about guys that when I ask her if she likes shes like "no, but w/e w/e" and she always puts me in hypothetical situations when shes talking about some controversy with a guy, even though she denies liking them most of the time.      The other things she does were being against me liking her close friend, how she said was slutty and drank to much, bad haircut, etc. She also confronted my old friend who Ive never talked to around her, and she asked if we were going out.      In a recent conversation she said I miss you, randomly asked if I liked anyone new, and said we should hang out soon - albeit not in a full out FLIRT way but not in a soley friend way.

20090220124055AA9b4gu	Family & Relationships;Family	Religion and the MIL?	I'm a catholic and my mother in law is pentecostal.  We've have disagreements in the past about religion and she's tried to push her religion on us.  Telling us what to do, what to believe, etc...      Anyway, the other day she is over our house for dinner.  My husband wasn't home from work yet so we ate without him.  Before dinner, I gave my mil and her nephew (who is 18) plenty of time to pray while I was in the kitchen.  I sat down at the table, grabbed my fork and was about to eat when she says...will you pray for us?  I looked at her and said...I don't pray before I eat.  She says, well...for me?      I said a short grace and shot her a glance.  I didn't feel like having an argument right there...but I thought it was inappropriate.      Any thoughts?
20090220124439AACuf8T	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Military husband abandonment....?	Here's the deal. Im married to a Marine, while he was deployed he decided he didn't want to be with me anymore. He took my name off of our joint checking account, so I couldn't pay our bills, or our apt, causing it to go into an eviction. I later learned he didn't want to be with me because he's started seeing someone else.    He came back from deployment 3 months ago, refuses to see me, and he took my only car. He won't see me to sign the divorce paperwork, because he said he wants to continue to receive BAH, and he doesn't even use it on housing, he stays with his friends rent free.    Right now currently, I have no car, no job, I had to drop out of my university, and I'm homeless. I stayed with my Dad for a month, then my mom for a month, but I can't live with family, its not an option, due to my families religious background they don't consider it appropriate for me (because im married) to be living with them.     I don't know what to do. I set up an appointment with JAG. I even called his First Sgt, and never heard back from him, anyon have any advice? I don't know what to do anymore...
20090220124536AAoVQ5X	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	My marriage worries me.  I need advice on what to do to fix a slump.?	I have been married almost 10 years, have two children but I have been unhappy for a few years now.  We have communication problems because he feels that he can't talk to me.  We argue and I feel better when he is not around.  I have to be there for my kids and I get down and can't function like a parent when we are together. Help?
20090220124539AAqqkQp	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Husband and i are at a loss...help!?	Our kids are good. They are sweet, they can be very helpful and so on, but like every other kid in the world, they get in trouble. My husband and I are at the breaking point right about now. Our daughter is 6 our son is 4. We try to step back and remember that kids will try to test the limits. We do try and stay patient and try not to go off the deep end. I need to know how it works in other families homes in these situations:  When you are talking to your kid(s) about something important, do they interrupt you and ask a complelty irrelevant question? LIke if you are trying to tell them that they need to remember to stay seated on the chair...and in the midst of your exlpaination they ask.... why bananas are yellow? We try real hard to keep our talks short and sweet, we know too much talking and they'll turn a deaf ear...We do timeouts, take away privledges...we've yelled, we've spoken softly....nothing seems to get into these kids heads. We have to tell them everyday the same thing...Don't kick the dog, Don't pick up the cat, Stop whining, Talk with a big boy voice, Do not touch that...I know this is what parenting is all about...but we have never had this issue with them before. They have always been easy to deal with. Solutions were not hard to find...and now...we can't seem to get ahold of them. Everything feels like its spinning out of control...I hate that I have to work because I feel like my job as the mom is to take hold of this situation. I've been back to work fulltime for the last year. Its only been the last few months that we haven't been able to get control of them. I don't know...This is the first time since they have both been born that I feel complelty lost. I know I didn't give much, but if anyone could give me some relief, advise whatever...but please spare me the insults and the disrespect...I'm a human, I'm not just words on a screen, We try hard to have a good happy life, we are not dumb@$$ parents, we are both intelligent...we're just at our point of AAgggggh!!

I realllly like this guy and I know he likes me but he said to a friend that he needs to get to know me better but that I'm awesome (translation sounds better in the actual language) and fun to be with. How do I "get to know him"? The only time I'll get to see him is with other people and he told my friend to give me his number.... I don't want to call first! And its weird cause I'm sure he got the hint that I like him lol. So how do I subtly say something thats not too obvious? JUST what do I do!?

20090220124855AAZES8a	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Rebelling against parents or life in general? (please answer)?	My best friend is 17 and a senior in a private high school. Shes beautiful, popular and the president of our year. Shes dated the quarterback of the football team and the best swimmer in the school. Last year she started hanging out with this girl and her friends from a public school and I told her that I thought the girl had a crush on her and my friend admitted to me that she was gay and had a crush on the girl. The two of them started dating a little while later. I dont care that shes gay, but I feel like the other girl made her gay. I don't get how she could go from dating "rich cute guys" to dating a public school girl. She never slept with any of her boyfriends, but after dating this girl for about 9-10 months she slept with her.

I think she is going to do this again or try to push me out. She says bad things to or kids about me that i am the fault. Can she have me ordered to move out and pay the mortage?

20090220130020AAU9L1j	Family & Relationships;Friends	Should I be worried about my friend or is she just seeking attention?	I'm really worried about my friend. Well she told me that she stopped cutting and I was very happy about that. But yesterday, she was saying that we shouldn't be too close because "something might happen to her". While she was still in her 'cutting phase', she was sort of suicidal and talked about killing herself. But she's also been very sick and something might be wrong with her. I feel that she isn't telling me something. I think she either feels that she might kill herself and doesn't want to hurt me or she has some disease.   I don't want to ask her about this because I think she might take it the wrong way. But I'm still worried. What should I do?   I also believe that she has some family problems. Not too major but something to look into.   Btw, I have never met her parents so I couldn't really talk to them. They also know about her cutting but they don't seem to do much, from what I know.
20090220130025AAzwiL4	Family & Relationships;Family	Ugh family crisis? please help me!!!!?	My sister is a sight oriented person, and so she likes to keep trash and junk because it comforts her. I know I am probably sounding selfish but she literally collects cardboard boxes, napkins that have drawings on them, jewelry box cushions, broken things, etc. but the thing is, we share a room, and it just piles and piles up with trash. He drawers are full of junk! I don't know what to do. I like having a clean room, not a dump. She's mad at me right now and started to cry because i was going to throw away a "fuzz" thing that she called "soft." And started to yell, so my older brother came in and said to let her have it. Well i really dont think he understands that its not just HER room, its partly mine too. She's younger than me by the way. she just turned 10 and im 14. He's always so quick to defend her and i dont know why. fine i just feel like i should start collecting beer bottles and putting them all over my room. it just really bugs. Any advice?
20090220130206AAZEgNK	Family & Relationships;Friends	Me and my friend crashed this girls car and RAN!  Will we get caught?	There is this girl I hate so much named Jane.  Do you know what she did?  She got a date rape drug and she put it in my drink at a party so I fell unconscious and somebody could rape me.  Luckily, no body did.      I am only 14!  Jane is 15, and her parents are spoiling her!  They let her DRIVE TO SCHOOL!  She lives super close to school though.  So anyways, in the changeroom my friend Courtney quickly swiped Jane's keys.      We decided we were going to drive her car to the plaza parking lot, and leave it there.  The cops would find it, but we would give her a good scare.  The parking lot doesn't have ANY cameras (a teacher even said and we checked and there are none)      I have 4th period lunch, Courtney has 3rd period lunch.  I have driven a car before at a party so I learned a lot...  So me and Courtney like put on scarfs and glasses and we wore ALL black and no one could see us.  We got in the car and we drove.  I was driving.  We went to the plaza and it was kind of hard for me to park the car but I got it.      Courtney told me to back up a bit then go forwards, to get the car in place.  So I reversed and then I went forwards but I was going fast and I was so close to the wall.  I hit the brakes (expecting the car to stop RIGHT away), but it didn't, so I thought I was pushing the wrong one, and I hit the gas by accident.  The car lunged forwards and me and Courtney screamed so much and it smashed into the plaza.  I reversed and I saw the car was so badly damaged.  BUT NO ONE NOTICED!      I quickly drove the car behind the plaza and I called my boyfriend.  I didn't want him to know what he did, so I made up an excuse.      My boyfriends dad owns a massive autoshop with a HUGE parking lot behind it.  I asked him the address for it, and I told him my mom needed it.      So we drove there and I drove the car so fast in the parking lot.  At the very end there was a ditch and some trees and tons of bushes and snow.  Courtney said we should drive the car into it so we did.  It hurt a lot and the car got more damaged and the wheels were stuck deep in the ground.  It was so hard to get out.  But we got out and we ran.      I wore a hat, gloves, scarf, ski mask, black leather boots, black pants, sexy white shirt with black jacket.      Will I get caught?      Courtney said we should go there and I am actually considering it!  Like, if the car is destroyed, all the evidence is gone right?  So what if we wash it completley, or throw fireworks inside?  Courtney said we should just throw a couple fireworks in it and run and it will probably destroy all the evidence so when they find it no one will realize.      WHAT SHOULD I DO!  I keep freaking out and I am so worried - more worried than I have ever been in my entire life!

20090220130453AAqmiAb	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does she like me, or is she just being friendly?	So there's this girl in my class i've had a crush on for a while, and I think she likes me, but I'm not sure so I thought I could get some advice here.   I sit in front of her in French class, and every class me and her start talking, and we talk so much tot he point that the teacher sometimes changes the seats of one of us. We also tend to hold hands a lot, link arms and she even pretends that I'm her boyfriend, and it's so convincing that some of our teachers and friends thought we really were going out. We're also really close when it comes to the "touch barrier", I mean, I sometimes hold her from her waist against me, I kiss her in the cheek all then time, I hug her a lot also, and she likes to put her head on my shoulder in class. She also likes to give me these little bites, and when I turned 17, which was like 3 days ago she said she would give me a kiss as a present, and that I could pick the place. And I also happen to know that she thinks I'm the 2nd best looking guy in my class, 'cause she said it to a friend of mine. And I don't think she's being a flirt, because I have never seen her do anything even remotely close to the things we do with other guys.   The reason why I'm confused is that she once told in class to some of us that she only dates guys that are like, 18 or 19 years old (she didn't say it out of the blue, she said it because we were talking about stuff like that), and because I also think she is kinda out of my league ( it's not like I'm ugly, I mean I have blonde hair and blue eyes, but she is just absolutely beautiful). So, what do you think, does she like me?      BTW, I'm 17 and she is gonna be 18 in a month.

20090220133719AA1gRHk	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Marriage versus job....?	If your marriage was on the rocks because of the lack of time together, you both work opposite schedules and in order to make your marriage work you need to make more time to be together and to be able to communicate to each other.  Thing is, you both have opposite work schedules so its impossible to maintain a marriage because you never see each other and never have time to talk.  So if it came down to this... obviously its so bad divorce is becoming the only option.      Your spouse told you, in order to  make this marriage work you need to make more time to spend together.  Would you look for a new job, change your schedule which would mean being demoted at your work, or would you keep your job and let the marriage go?

20090220133421AAFheX0	Family & Relationships;Family	Should i forgive him? seriously? (moms helpful!)?	well this is kind of my life story. i don't know if i should forgive my biological father who left my mom and I 3 times.         When i was still in the womb my mom was left around 5 months pregnant. She was left for another woman. Jeff was in the army and he was cheating on my mom. She went to the man in charge and told him about Jeff. He couldn't do anything about it, unless she had proof he was cheating. She couldn't find anything. But one day, the day she gave up she swore she heard a whisper in her ear. "look in the closet". she did, and she saw a duffel bag she never noticed before even though she looked in the closet hundreds of times. it was locked, and she knew it was the proof she needed. (to this day she swares that God told her) she took it to the captain he got it open. And they saw it was full of Love notes, flowers, chocolates, bears, ect. they were not for my mom, they were for Jeanine. He left. He left us on the Army camp. The captain made him come back and move us into an apartment, with our needs taken care of. He got us in an apartment, got some of our needs taken care of. My mom was in the hosp. when she reached 7 months. she was sick and weighed 75 pounds. She gave birth to me, and Jeff was in the Hallway talking on his phone to his girlfriend while my mom was giving birth to me. and Left. he said he was going on a buisness trip. He kept sending my letters saying im coming back, im coming back. i cant wait to see you and the baby. i love you... even though he was lieing. Then he filed divorce against my mom, and tried to take me away from her. He took EVERYTHING my mom had. except my mom fought only for me. She eventually met my "step" dad. except he is mor elike my biological father, he loves me, cares for me, and was my daddy growing up. i Love him SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO much! Jeff wanted back in my life when i was about 1. My mom and dad were happily married. and he wanted in. Jeff wanted me to call him daddy, and for me to love him. my mom asked him this: if u care so much, and you think you know everything about her. what color are her eyes? he said Blue, they arent. I allowed him back in my life around 6, (i was very mature for my age). everything was fine. kinda. then 4 yrs later when i was 10. he left me. again. for another woman...................................... my moms best friend. I am now a young teen. i have taken my dad's last name over my biological father's last name. im happier without Jeff in my life. its much less complicated. i now have two younger siblings. and 2 older. (one from my dad's previous marriage. and we adopted one from Kenya) i love my life! but i still have not forgiven him. should i? should i forgive and forget? forget him and just live my life. forgive him and let him back in my life. or let him ack in my life and don't forgive him. its really stressing me out, ruining my grades... and so on. what do you think? but he did leave me.      thanks so much to all who answers!!!    love Dallas
20090220133102AAw8ozf	Family & Relationships;Family	My mum makes my uncle and aunt food because they are housebound but he complained its...?	he complained that its not cooked properly. Last week he got angry because we couldn't deliver the food in the afternoon so we delivered it in the morning instead because we had to send our car to the garage. Sometimes he also asks my mum to make food for his 32 year old daughter and her 3 kids for when they come over. I told my mum to stop cooking for him because he is taking advantage but she doesn't know how to say "no". She has been doing it for 4 years because she wanted to help out to reduce the stress for my uncle as he is obese and has a wife to care for who has never left the house once (except for hospital visits) in 15 years.
20090220132746AAqpTBO	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What should I do about this ho that works with my fiance?	My boyfriend just asked me to marry him a week ago and he told this girl he works with and she got pissed and he's asked why she was mad and she said that shes good at breaking up happy homes! He works at olive garden and she's a waitress there. Then he said that laswt night he had a dream that he cheated on me with my sister but she lives in another state so i know that's not possible. But do you think that he's thinking of cheating on me with this girl. Should I confront her and how should i do it or just trust that my fiance has things under control.

Ok, so i like this girl who's really beautiful, and two of my girl friends suggests that they'd talk to her and see what she thinks of me. One of my friends talks to her, and says "isn't julio a cutie" and according to my friend she said yeah. Me and the girl i like barely talked to each other, except for face book but she'd always look at me during first semester, i barely see her anymore. Anyways, my other girl friend  asks during science with her "just wondering if you'd go out with him" and she says "i don't really know him that much". have i been shut down? she liked a boy who was half asian but he didn't like her back and i too am half asian so my friend says that she's into half asian boys so, i dunno.

20090220133012AAFR78x	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Ask much can a simple divorce run?	We don't have kids, and don't own a home. Really have nothing in a joint name cept electric and cable bill, oh and a joint checking account with little to no money in it. We have three animals and I am sure we wouldn't have a problem figure out who takes them. It wouldn't be a nasty divorce and really non of us has any assets.  I have a paid of 2001 truck with 100000 miles on it. Thats really it. It would be a pretty easy split minus the emotional part, I don't know if we would even need a lawyer. How much would a divorce like this cost?
20090220133442AABunVB	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Will the father most likely be the guy you had the most sex with?	Plz no rude comments. I got myself into a bad situation, guilt is eating away at me, and I feel so hopeless and don't know what to do. I am married, and I had a one night stand with a guy. I regret it alot. I am now pregnant, and Im not sure who the father is. During the time I supposedly conceived I had sex pretty much every day with my husband and once with the one night stand. I know that I can't know for sure until I do a paternity test, but I was looking for some advice and reasurrance. I really want the baby to be my husbands. I love him so much and I can't loose him. I know I was stupid and selfish, but I can't change it now. Are the chances higher that its my husbands since we had sex more? Thanks. Again, try not leave rude, mean comments. I am so depressed already. thanks. Also, plz don't judge me.
20090220133129AAO4VRt	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do girls/women think hitting guys in the groin is a joke?	A girl in school said that she wanted to try something. I said sure and she told me to stand with my arms and legs spread and close my eyes. I did and she kicked me in the nuts! It hurt like hell. The girl and her friends just laughed at me. The teacher saw it and she just giggled. When I told my mother about it she just laughed and said that it was the oldest trick in the book and she did it to boys too when she was young. She said that young girls do this for fun and I have to be smarter to avoid it or get used to it. Is this right? Should I just accept that girls can hit guys in the balls for fun?

20090220133431AArBc40	Family & Relationships;Weddings	My mother in law doesnt want to come to the wedding?!?!?!?	ill start from the beginning. So I started dating her son like three years ago, and at first his mom and i were BEST FRIENDS. i Secretly knew she was talking bad about me to everyone, but i let it go for the sake of the fact it is his mom, but we moved to vegas for his job. Then that's when i started to get close all the people in family and they started telling me " she is telling everyone lies about you" and telling them just talking really bad about every chance she got. I kept my mouth shut. so she came to visit i ignored her. I was sooo angry i couldn't even look her in the face( i was more hust than anything). then she and her son got into it about the fact she was doing all of these awful things to us. so we both stop talking to her. i sent her an email explaining Altot of things such as; iwasn'tt gonna arguewithh her and how if she hates me i cant  change that, and i explained that when she is ready we will be here (she cannot act like an adult) so then we moved again to california and. he proposed and we told his dad since we are not talking to his mom and she keeps telling everyone she is not coming!! i told everyone she is invited, but how do i get her to realize to let her grudgee down and come?
