20090129041739AA4I3g8	News & Events;Current Events	Here are ten media stories about the Safe Zone for civilians and why it is not safe. What is believable?	It is believable that the LTTE is distorting claims. It is believable that even though a news service dropped the story for inaccuracy that it still gets coverage in media. It is believable that a safe zone was created to protect innocent civilians. It is believable that LTTE is fighting in civilian garb. What is unbelievable is that the LTTE will not let the civilians go and that nobody that represents the Tamil Diaspora, not one of these men that spoke of your quest, will set the people free. The voices of the people and cadre that have managed to get to safety tell of how grateful they are to be safe and out of the clutches of the Tamil Tigers. No former cadre, no political ally, no funder of your "rebel" movement. None of your parliamentary proxies, not your children. You can find people to make movies, sing raps about destruction but in your entire circle there isn't one that can speak for the people that you pose to represent.

Over these past few years i have noticed that crime is getting totally out of control.    Before i used to live under the impression that London was the place to be ... Jobs, friends and a good culture too.    Now i don't live in London. I live quite far from it (thank God) ...   But i have been to London, i have seen the places ... Sure Kensington looks nice and so does Oxford Street too ...    But if you look at the other parts of London .. East London ... The underground late at night, it is just all so unsafe and i am now feeling uneasy and i no longer have the confidence that i once had.    I fear travelling to somewhere new now and this violent crime wave is NOT just in London i would like to add, it can also be found in Brimingham, Manchester and even Stoke-On-Trent too (Hanley has been called "chavs paradise")      I have seen other parts of Europe ...    Germany, France and Denmark too. Those places feel much safer than London, put me right in the heart of Copenhagen (Denmarks equivalent to London) any night of the week ... It feels safe!    But put me in the middle of London, Birmingham, Manchester etc ...  And i am not ashamed to admit i would be absolutely terrified.    Is there anyone out there that can relate to me?   Anyone else think it is a good idea to up sticks and move for another life somewhere else in Europe?

20090129052703AAMMECc	News & Events;Current Events	Would you wage a silent but stubborn struggle to celebrate your own culture? ?	As Chinese celebrate the beginning of the Year of the Ox with fireworks and family feasts, a silent but stubborn struggle is being waged over a similar Tibetan holiday.In the fallout of a brief but widespread uprising by Tibetans last March, the celebration of the Tibetan new year, or Losar, has taken on a new sensitivity. The traditional Tibetan new year will fall during the new moon in February this year, exactly one month after the Han Chinese celebration. The Chinese Year of the Ox began on Monday.    This year, some Tibetans, including exiles and intellectuals, are refraining from celebrating as a quiet protest gesture, and have urged others to do the same in heated exchanges on the Internet. Meanwhile, some communities that usually celebrate at the same time as Chinese have delayed their holiday to coincide with the Tibetan calendar.    "I'm going home to visit my parents this year, since they are old. But we won't have any outside celebrations, no firecrackers or anything," said a Tibetan peddler in Beijing whose hometown of Nagqu, north of Lhasa, marks the new year next month."That's because of the (Sichuan) earthquake in May, and also because of the March events."    In the mountains of Aba prefecture, also in Sichuan province, devotees circled a mountain on Monday, New Year's Day, and planned performances and worship at the monastery as usual."Of course we'll celebrate the new year, the Tibetan one. Everyone looks forward to that," said another Tibetan in Beijing.

JERUSALEM – Israel's chief rabbinate severed ties with the Vatican on Wednesday to protest a papal decision to reinstate a bishop who publicly denied 6 million Jews were killed during the Holocaust. The Jewish state's highest religious authority sent a letter to the Holy See expressing "sorrow and pain" at the papal decision.      "It will be very difficult for the chief rabbinate of Israel to continue its dialogue with the Vatican as before," the letter said. Chief rabbis of both the Ashkenazi and Sephardic Jews were parties to the letter.      The rabbinate, which faxed a copy of the letter to The Associated Press, also canceled a meeting with the Vatican set for March. The rabbinate and the state of Israel have separate ties with the Vatican, and Wednesday's move does not affect state relations.   --------------------------------------   No after having read this, do you think the chief rabbinate did the right thing? Completely severing all ties with the Holy See just because of one man's deluded opinion?

"Seven diners in northern Japan fell ill and three were still in hospital today after eating blowfish testicles prepared in a restaurant not authorised to serve the poisonous delicacy.      The owner of the restaurant in Tsuruoka city, who is also the chef, had no licence to serve blowfish and was being questioned on suspicion of professional negligence, police official Yoshihito Iwase said.      Iwase said the seven men ordered sashimi and grilled blowfish testicles at the restaurant last night.      Shortly after, they developed limb paralysis and breathing trouble and started to lose consciousness – typical signs of blowfish poisoning – and were rushed to a hospital for treatment.      A 68-year-old diner was in a critical condition with respiratory failure and two others, aged 55 and 69, were in serious condition, Iwase said.      "It's scary. If you go to a decent-looking restaurant that serves fugu, you would assume a cook has a proper fugu license," Iwase said, using the Japanese term for blowfish.      Blowfish poison, called tetrodotoxin, is nearly 100 times more poisonous than potassium cyanide, according to the Ishikawa health serv

I've tried recently to get a handle on how one's perception of Jews in general may change with the behaviour of the Jewish State, particularly recently (Gaza). Almost invariably, the responses go along the lines of "it's nothing to do with Jews--it's 'Zionists','anti-Palestinian Israelis' or 'the Government'. I don't know what this means--and every time I try to find out, I get waffle.   My question is simply "If Jews don't run Israel, then who the hell DOES?"   And if they don't, WHY don't they? Why would the Jewish State only elect NON-JEWS into their highest office?   I can understand how, if the Israeli Government WERE Jewish, that may lead to a lot of Arab deaths (as Jews and Arabs have an historical enmity). But if they're NOT Jews, then WHO are they, and why are they doing the Jewish State's dirty work? Are they political mercenaries? Thanks!

20090129053936AAEBw2n	News & Events;Current Events	Have you heard od PMSBuddy? Would you sign on? ?	Melbourne, Jan 29 (ANI):       PMSBuddy.com, a site created as an online reminder service, has seen one hundred thousand men sign up for its service.The site, which educates men on knowing when their partner is likely to be suffering pre-menstrual syndrome (PMS), is the brainchild of a 28-year-old man who has gone through most of the different phases with his partners.    The reminders include pithy messages of encouragement such as "She's on yellow - tread carefully, fella" - as well as tips for how men can mitigate the damage.It tells men never to ask if a woman has PMS, and if all else fails to buy flowers, deemed to be "kryptonite to PMS."    CEO and founder Jordan Eisenberg developed PMSbuddy.com after friends talked about the world-class diplomacy men needed to bring up the topic of PMS with their partners."It's hard for guys to know if they did something to piss of their lady and hard to remember when PMS is, and always awkward to confront and ask the question without coming off like a jerk," News.com.au quoted him as saying.    "One of the guys actually kept track in his daily planner, and from there we decided to automate this process and offer it to the masses," he said.    He also admitted that while functionality is first and foremost, some women may find the idea of their cycles being 'tracked' a little offensive."Certainly some do, but the majority do feel it is helpful, and the remainder at least get a kick and a laugh out of it," Eisenberg said."Those in relationships have been overwhelmingly supportive and many have actually signed themselves up to warn their boyfriends (or) husbands. If anything, we feel we can minimise unnecessary fights by allowing men to offer some slack," he added.    PMSBuddy started nine months ago and is now tracking the menstrual cycles of more than 100,000 women worldwide, including 4000 in Australia and 1000 in New Zealand via the site and a Facebook application. Eisenberg says the site's fan base is growing rapidly and has plans to launch an iPhone application in the immediate future. (ANI)

So really, I have watched the news release and read the articles about the nod this man gave the President when he passed by. What was so incredibly bad about it? It was a nice nod, nothing offensive at all and the man actually looked proud to have had a chance to do it.       We do not live in a Communist Country, yet! What is the big deal?      Thoughts...

20090129070658AAS73Vg	News & Events;Current Events	Why do representatives forget retired people when throwing out money?	Once again the retired population is ignored by representatives when giving out money. At least the senate plan calls for us to get 300 instead of the 500 others are getting.  Does that mean they too consider us inferior citizens.  We paid more taxes for more years that those now working but they do not understand that or we would get 500 too. If they can give wall street billions the retired should get the full 500.  Speak up and let your representative know how you feel about being ignored, again.

20090129070014AAyTeaW	News & Events;Current Events	Why should China pay for our mistakes?	Given that the US will only be able to fund the trillion dollars for the Stimulus Bill by borrowing money, we put China or any other investor nation into the ridiculous position of just having to continually buy our debt. If they ever cashed out, our government would collapse into bankruptcy.  Here's why: If China holds $1 Billion of US Bonds and it matures, then the US is expected to pay up. Well, we don't have the money! So we'd have to print some...which would devalue our currency, making that $1 Billion worth much less...so China's only option is to keep buying our Bonds. This prevents the Chinese from spending their own money on Chinese interests. Since this mess is the US people's own fault, Why should China pay for our mistakes? And if they should, how long is such a system sustainable?

Now it is a well known fact that if a person has ever failed to pay their taxes on time they cannot EVER work for the IRS. So why does Obama want Geithner to LEAD the IRS after not paying taxes for 3 years. And I don't believe it was just a "misinterpretation". No, it was covering up for fraud.

It seems like a daily occurence to read headlines like this and this is very disturbing to think that more and more people are going to opt to these measures as a solution to their problems.      There's always a way.  Why is it people feel they have to live by certain standards otherwise life is hopeless?  It's not.      I think it's time government sets up some counselling for people like this.      THESE people need bailouts....LIFE SAVING bailouts.        They shouldn't just fire people without making sure they are going to be okay.        When someone is the sole provider or two people lose their jobs, someone should STEP IN AND MAKE SURE these families are going to be okay!!!!
20090129073216AA3jO5m	News & Events;Media & Journalism	Is FOX news the most biased news network in the world?	Many Americans use Al Jazeera as an example of a biased news network.  However, form what I've seen of it, al Jazeera looks less biased than FOX news, since the commentators don't impose as many of their own views as they do on FOX.         http://english.aljazeera.net/        http://www.foxnews.com/

Israel has occupied gaza for 34 years. This is illegal and yet this part of the story is never covered in the media it's only mentioned when gaza has no Option to defend them selves therefore with no options but to fight back.       israel has stopped any aid Relief, medical attention food etc into gaza borders.       The palestinians are malnutrition, making them weaker which makes it easier for them not to retaliate again Israelis.       Israeli es are bombing and killing in prime result to wipe out the population so they can take over the land.       This is just a repetition of the Holocaust ... and no one is doing anything about because they feel guilty for letting the Holocaust happen in the first place.       The american media is controlled by Israel,  making all the stories in favour of israel. Controlling the views of americans.      THIS IS PROPAGANDA.      what do you think
