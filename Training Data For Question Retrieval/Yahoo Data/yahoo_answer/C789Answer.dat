alIO8ic0aa	Nope<br>  PLEASE NOTE that when substituting a solid fat, such as butter with a liquid one (vegetable oil) or vice versa, adversely affects the taste or the texture of your recipe. Melted butter cannot be substituted with a liquid fat because butter contains milk solids which set after the recipe has baked and cooled; oil doesn't. The rule of thumb is to substitute one solid fat for another (ie: butter for shortening), and oil with another oil (vegetable oil for canola oil). That's because when a fat is solid, it acts differently in a baking recipe than a fat that's liquid.|`|XzLUA7ataa	Yes, but it won't taste as good.  Just like baking cookies with oil rather than making butter cookies.|`|SnkaH7W6aa	You can try.  If you use anything, use butter.  Real butter, unsalted, will definitely be better than margarine......|`|MMcVXxAGaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  I don't think you can substitute butter with oil. I have substituted vegetable oil for olive oil, and on occasion (depending on the recipe) margarine for butter, but I wouldn't swap oils for spreads unless the recipe specifically states you can.<br>  <br>  I haven't tried nor known anyone who has, but my thinking is that butter is a solid fat at room temperature whilst oil isn't. If you used oil where a recipe required the use of butter you may end up with a sloppy mess or some other muck up with the consistency.<br>  <br>  My suggestion is to check a few different recipes for caramel popcorn online - you might find a variation on the recipe which suits what you want to do / the ingredients you have.<br>  <br>  Have fun!

PRzmwFfgaa	You have a good point.  But I am a meat eater so I guess that my opinion counts.  But I just wanted to say that your question should be directed toward vegetarians and not vegans.

They breed animals, often in horrific conditions. Many animals have no life outside a stall or cage. Some don;t even make it that far.

Simple.<br>  Nothing about humans is 'designed' for meat consumption.<br>  Nothing from our jaws, teeth, saliva, all the way down to our digestive tract.  Everything about is suggests that the type of food that we are 'designed' to mainly eat is fruit.  We are fruitavours by nature.

Biology 101.|`|8X3S2PGRaa	Some people argue that we are naturally omnivorous, that we have histories as hunter-gatherers. Others will argue that we come from primates, who are gentle vegetarians. Another important point to consider is that we are the only animals with consciences, cognition, philosophy, and in some cases, the power to choose what we eat, as well as intelligently modify our diet to be healthier. In that sense, you just have to weigh the choices and the information about health, preference, ethics (for yourself and industrial meat), and ecology. I've also heard the argument that human teeth are more similarly structured to herbivorous than carnivorous animals.  I'd be really impressed if you personally hunt and eat your prey.|`|aPscVrOoaa	The food chain is natural and part of animals/humans instincts. Some people choose to go against what is natural. Animals don't have that choice, they can't run into a grocery store and buy soy hot dogs.<br>  <br>  And....I would just like to add that people act like humans killing animals is so horrible. But what about the people in history (Indians, explorers, people that came on the Mayflower,etc.) that had to hunt and kill their own food? Just because our modern society allows us to buy already butchered meat at the store doesn't make us terrible.|`|entB7tPQaa	Because we destroy their environment and abuse them and cram them in small cages for entertainment.

The recipe I use is typically for a whole chicken, so I would substitute 4 - 5 legs and thighs in this case.<br>  <br>  Take the cleaned pieces and put them in a rectangular glass baking dish. Mix one small or 1/2 large bottle of Catalina Island French salad dressing with one envelope of Lipton's French Onion Soup Mix. At this stage, depending on your preference, you could add to the pan of chicken any of the following: Onions, 1 inch dice, red/green/yellow bell pepper, 1 inch dice, and/or pineapple tidbits. Pour the sauce mix over the whole thing and swirl it around to coat all the pieces. Cover with foil to keep moist.<br>  <br>  Bake in a 375 degree oven until the chicken juices run clear. You will want to make a batch of fluffy rice or mashed potatoes to soak up the delicious sauce from the chicken bake.

EMDNVrcjaa	TO SHAPE THE PASTELITOS:<br>  <br>  When using Pepperidge Farm:<br>  -Take the sheets of puff pastry and smooth out the folds a little bit (do not oversmooth it)<br>  -With a very sharp knife, make cuts across the sheets, as if you were drawing the lines for playing tic-tac-toe. You will have 9 squares per sheet.<br>  -Place filling (about a teaspoon full) in the middle of the square.<br>  -Fold down from top corner to lower corner to enclose the filling and form a triangle.<br>  -Press all around the two open edges with a fork to seal tightly.<br>  -Place pastries on a cookie sheet or jelly roll pan, not too close so that they can puff up without touching the next one.<br>  -Brush the tops with a simple syrup (sugar water-same amount sugar as water) using a pastry brush.<br>  -Place in 350oF oven on the middle rack. Takes about 20-30 minutes to puff up and turn golden and flaky (depends on your oven and altitude, so keep a close eye on the first batch to test your oven)<br>  NOTE: The less you handle the sheets of pastry the more it will puff up.<br>  <br>  FILLINGS:<br>  <br>  Almost anything can be used as a filling. The traditional filings are small dabs of guava marmalade and cream cheese, "picadillo" (*) style meat fillings, or a sweetened cream cheese filling.<br>  <br>  Other fillings I have used succesfully:<br>  Sweet Fillings:<br>  -Mango pieces cooked in sugar to form a marmalade.<br>  -Apple pie filling (I like the Comstock brand)- add a small dusting of cinnamon after you brush tops with the sugar water.<br>  -Cherry pie filling (same brand as above)<br>  <br>  Savory Fillings:<br>  -Cream cheese and fresh herbs such as basil or thyme. You need to taste your batch as you add the herbs to the cream cheese to make sure the taste comes through.<br>  -Picadillo style ground beef.<br>  -Cream cheese and ground up potted meats, such as Devil's Ham or Chicken. Once, in a pinch, I even used Spam ground up in the cream cheese. it worked, they were good!.

Thanks for the reminder though!|`|AA12336927	No unfortunately, we have to wait till around Mothers Day here in Oh-freaking-io|`|hHCdXq0Naa	When I lived in Southern California, I always had them planted by now.  Here, in north Texas, even though it's in the 80's now, we could likely get a few hard frost nights later (it snowed in March the last 2 years).  I have herbs in, but am waiting for veggies|`|532XA7lkaa	No way...it'll be May before I even try to plant tomatoes here in central Illinois.  We have had so many late freak frosts, and I've lost a lot of money because I plant a lot...that I just wait.  Once they are in the ground they grow like weeds, so I don't mind planting late.  I get tomatoes into late October...|`|TJOHxhEUaa	Eggplants, yes; tomatoes and peppers in just a few more days.  We're in Washington next door to Idaho and it got down to 15 degrees last night, so we have to grow everything indoors until at least May!|`|vYeS5mYnaa	Ha! i'm in new brunswick canada. <br>  still under 5 ft of snow.<br>  <br>  mmm tomatoes
alIO8ic0aa	POTATO ROLLS   <br>  <br>  1/2 c. lukewarm water (105 degrees)<br>  1 pkg. dry granulated yeast<br>  1 c. mashed potatoes<br>  1 1/2 c. potato water<br>  2/3 c. sugar<br>  1 c. shortening<br>  1 tbsp. salt<br>  2 well beaten eggs<br>  8 c. sifted all-purpose flour<br>  <br>  Allow yeast to soften in lukewarm water. Combine hot, freshly mashed potatoes (very smooth and free from lumps) with potato water, sugar, shortening and salt. The heat of the potatoes and potato water will melt the shortening. When cooled to lukewarm, add softened yeast, beaten eggs and 4 cups of the flour and mix well. Then sift in all but 1/2 cup of the remaining flour and mix until smooth. Rub the 1/2 flour into a bread cloth or board, turn dough onto the board and knead until the dough is as smooth as satin.<br>  A bit more flour may be sprinkled on the cloth in the dough is at all sticky, but don't work in a lot more.<br>  <br>  Round up into a ball and place in a well greased bowl. Grease top of dough well and cover with damp cloth. Keep cloth damp. Place in refrigerator.<br>  <br>  This is enough for about 4 dozen pan rolls. If you would like a dozen tonight, cut off about 1/4 of the dough before refrigerating. All this fourth to rise until double in bulk. Then roll out the dough to about an inch thick and cut into rounds. Brush tops with melted butter, let rise until nearly double, then bake in a hot oven about 20 minutes. To make rolls later on, cut desired amount off the refrigerated dough, make into rolls and let rise until doubled. This cold dough will take longer to rise. Bake in hot oven (about 400 degrees) about 15-20 minutes.|`|8ivnzNi5aa	Some mighty tasty bread.|`|hHCdXq0Naa	Potato bread has potato in the dough.

XK9RLaPeaa	It all depends on why you went vegetarian. If it was for animal rights, or welfare, then yes it is wrong to eat dairy of any kind. Animals kept on dairy farms or egg farms are kept in horrible ways, just like meat animals. Although they have to live in tiny confined cages for years before they are killed. When their milk or egg production slows, they are sent to the slaughterhouse. And the males of milk or egg farms are either killed immediately, or the calves are sent to veal farms. The dairy industry is just as cruel as the meat industry. So if you are for animal rights, the vegan switch would be a welcomed one. Dont get me wrong, it is great that you went vegetarian. But when you have had the chance to adjust to that life style, you should consider going vegan. It really isnt that hard once you get used to it for a few weeks. Good luck!|`|llkSmgLJaa	Eggs are not meat, the one's you buy were never fertilized. You could get a few hens to keep as pets if your concerned with their treatment. I used to have 4 hens, but now I'm in college I buy from a local farm where I know the hens are well cared for.|`|2zHq2XIMaa	It's not hard at all, you just need to do a bit of research. Numerous foods don't contain eggs.<br>  I don't eat them because I think they are disgusting. We have two animal companion chickens at home just really as companions but sometimes they lay eggs which are clearly not fertilized as they are both female, I still wouldn't eat them because I consider them menstrual fluid of chickens. That's really what the unfertilized one's are.<br>  And they are cruel from the industry.<br>  <br>  Do all you can, good luck!!|`|mfXDUkRYaa	Personally, yes.<br>  <br>  I don't understand vegetarians who eat battery eggs. Most commercial products use battery eggs over free range.<br>  <br>  But even free range isn't cruelty free. The male chicks are killed in such gruesome ways, and the hens are killed when they are past their 'useful' life.|`|AA10686973	Chickens produce more eggs than they need to reproduce.  They do this becasue in the wild laying many eggs would make sure some would make it.|`|BNnhs3QOaa	You need eggs, they have a lot of protein that you are not getting from meat. So does peanut butter.|`|7f669666355088ae28d6131d734f565aaa	Wow, I went through the same thing and this is a serious decision. Honestly, I think you should continue your eating habits. Change too quickly can be pretty harsh on your body, and personally I think that eating eggs is the least cruel way to treat animals. If the egg had been fertilized, there would be too many chickens for nature to have a stable balance, and plus it's much better then having another chicken live just to get fried painfully later on. You may think by going without chicken and eggs will stop chickens from dying, but it won't. There are millions of people who still will eat meat, but at least we can still keep trying so that there are options where animals can actually have a LIFE before dying. This might persuade people to eat food the natural way and less suffering would happen. I really admire you for going without meat. I would also go entirely without meat except I need protein and eat poultry, including eggs. Honestly, animals are not meant to live a life full of agony and suffering. Here is a website you might be interested in that I use:<br>  <a href="http://www.peta2.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.peta2.org</a> I don't think animals were created to be tortured.|`|khXGGBiTaa	I don't think it's wrong that you eat eggs. At the end of the day, it's your choice. Eat them if you want to.<br>  <br>  I, personally, don't eat them, because it's my choice not to eat them. And I've done fine without them for a third of a century. I have concluded therefore that they are unnecessary in the human diet, and even unnecessary in cooking, as there are things you can easily substitute for them in cakes, biscuits, pancakes, etc. (for instance, a tablespoon of treacle or golden syrup or honey or malt extract per recipe-egg in cakes or biscuits).|`|iBvB3Lvsaa	I'm a vegan and the transition to become a vegan was not hard at all. It is not hard at all to not eat items containing egg in it, PLEASE do not use that as an excuse. <br>  <br>  It is not bad that you eat eggs but I would def def def recommend you buy local grown eggs. Even from the local market I am sure they have state grown eggs and milk. It might be a bit more expensive (30 cents more if that) but it tastes better and they treat the animals better.|`|UlN4EACsaa	Since an egg is not an animal, and most commercial eggs never had a chance to become an animal, it is fine to include them into your vegetarian diet.<br>  If the idea of eating eggs bothers you then there are a number of egg substitutes available pretty much in any grocery store you might visit.|`|yHaGnT4gaa	There is nothing wrong about eating eggs when u are a vegetarian. i think that the eggs in the stores are the eggs without chicks in it. I am a vegetarian and I eat eggs very often. It is one of my favorite foods. Don't worry.|`|RU2Yz6jEaa	ive been vegetarian for a year now and i still eat eggs. i dont like them alone, but when they are in a product i will eat that product.|`|lcuxD3qlaa	No I do not think its wrong..you probably do it for two reasons right?

6SqxGQsqaa	why dont u cook the apple mixture separately, let them cool then spoon them into the won ton wrappers.  i would say to fry them, they would be best fried, but if you are running low on oil then just boil one, then when it comes out, brush it with a little egg, and finish it off in the oven for some color. good luck.

Sauté chopped onions in olive oil in the crock-pot on the high setting for about 15 minutes. Add chopped garlic and sauté for 5 more minutes. Then add the rest of the ingredients and let it cook on low in the crock-pot for however long you want. Nothing in this recipe needs cooking so its just a matter of the longer it cooks together the more flavor it will have. I live in Northern California and rosemary is a ubiquitous landscaping plant here so I have an endless free supply. I think it is prolific in other parts of the country too. You might add a little cumin or Tabasco sauce too. Serve with brown bread and a little parmesan cheese. <br>  Black Bean Salad – You need: 1 can black beans, 1 can corn or frozen corn, 1 lime, ~2T fresh chopped cilantro, a fresh veggie (I like green pepper or tomato or avocado if you want to splurge). Add all ingredients to a tuper-wear and juice the lime. You might also add some chili powder or tobasco. Let it marinate together for at least 30 minutes. Eat with corn chips. <br>  Pasta – You need: whole wheat pasta, jar of marinara sauce (I like Classico’s selections), chopped frozen broccoli, parmesan cheese. I like to mix all these ingredients together but you could eat broccoli as a side dish. <br>  Ramen Stir Fry – You need: 2 pack ramen noodles, green pepper, onion, 3 eggs, 2T roasted peanuts, stir-fry seasoning. Soak the ramen noodles in warm water while you prep other ingredients. Sauté onion and green pepper. Add 3 eggs and scramble in the same pan as onion and green pepper but keeping the egg somewhat separate. Add the noodles and seasoning. I like to season with a sauce made from soy sauce, ginger, a little sesame oil, a little brown sugar, and quite a bit of lime juice. <br>  Burritos – You need: Green pepper, onion, can of black beans, tortilla’s, cheese and salsa. Sauté green pepper and onion. Add black beans and season with chili powder, garlic powder, cumin, and lime juice. Serve on flour tortilla’s with cheese (I think grating is worth it) and salsa. <br>  Fried Rice – You need: Rice, frozen peas, 2 eggs, onion, garlic, soy sauce, and ginger. I like to make rice ahead of time on the weekend and eat it several times. I usually cook rice in chicken bouillon for flavor. So sauté onion and add frozen peas to defrost. Scramble eggs in same pan. Add rice, ginger, and garlic. Add soy sauce and some sesame oil to taste. <br>  Curry Mushroom “Chicken” - You need: Cooked chicken breast or fake chicken (I like Quorn), frozen chopped broccoli, cream of mushroom soup, lemon juice, curry powder, shredded cheddar cheese. Defrost frozen items in microwave. Add a scoop of mushroom soup, ? T of curry powder, some lemon juice and shredded cheddar to the bowl and microwave again. You could eat with brown rice. <br>  Baked potato – Baked potatoes are great because you can put so many things on top of them. Some of the thing I like to put on are Morningstar crumbles (fake hamburger meat), sautéed mushrooms (season with Worcestershire), broccoli, salsa, shredded cheese, or black beans. <br>  Salmon Cakes – You need: 1 can pink salmon, 1 can white/northern beans, lemon juice, dill or thyme, minced garlic, 1 egg. Mix all ingredients together mashing beans and salmon. Make into patties and fry in olive oil. Serve on brown bread and add a dollop of plain yogurt or sour cream if you like. <br>  Veggie Burgers – Buy a pack of frozen veggie burgers (Morning star veggie burgers will usually go on sale for about $.75/patty.) serve on wheat toast (b/c I don’t like to buy special buns) with thinly sliced cheese and mustard. <br>  Hot dogs – Depending on whether cheap or healthy is more important to me at the time, I will buy veggie hot dogs (healthy) or turkey hot dogs (cheap). We like eating them on whole wheat sandwich bread with sauerkraut and mustard. We usually have a can of baked beans on the side. <br>  Heuvos Rancheros – You need: 4 eggs, flour tortillas, black beans, salsa, and shredded cheese. Scramble eggs. Warm tortillas in the microwave. Warm black beans sprinkled with lime juice, chili powder, and garlic powder in the microwave. Top tortillas with beans, egg, shredded cheese, and salsa.|`|Z5ereta1aa	well what do you have?<br>  <br>  if you have a variety of fruit you could make fruit salad<br>  <br>  if you have crackers and cheese, crackers and cheese!<br>  <br>  salad?<br>  <br>  toast? <br>  hope i helped,<br>  and try to not eat anything too heavy, you'll have trouble falling asleep tonight!<br>  <br>  good luck and happy eating!|`|PzoePMcgaa	Pop Tarts.

Also, consider blending eggs with sugar and butter mixture to incorporate before adding the ricotta.

It will thicken as it cools and can be beaten with a wire whisk or electric mixer before putting it on your cake.

For the salad it really just involves leafy greens which you can pick up in a grocery store pre-packaged.  Then just get a dressing of your choice.  <br>  <br>  Steak<br>  - 2 - 3 nice cuts of beef steak<br>  - 1 Cup Beer<br>  - 1Tbls. packed brown sugar<br>  - 1/2 tsp. Black Pepper<br>  - 1 tsp. Seasoned Salt<br>  Place the steaks in a shallow pan, pour beer over and marinate for 1 hour in the fridge.  Remove the steaks from the beer, discard beer.  Combine remaining ingredients and rub evenly over steaks.  Marinate steaks for 1/2 hour in the refridgerator.  Grill steaks over a medium-high flame until cooked to your liking. (note: a light beer will produce a mild flavor where as mild/dark will produce a stronger flavor)<br>  <br>  Garlic Mashed Potatoes<br>  5 or 6 medium potatoes<br>  3 cloves garlic<br>  3/4 cup buttermilk<br>  1/2 teaspoon salt<br>  1/4 teaspoon pepper<br>  large pot of salted water<br>  Peel potatoes and cut into large chunks about 2inches in size.  Cook potatoes and garlic together in pot of boiling salted water for 15 to 20 minutes or until potatoes are tender when pierced with a fork.

You can buy a box of shells, not the little ones that are good for macaroni salad, get a box of shells that will fit in the palm of your hand.<br>  <br>  There is a recipe on the box  or get the recipe from the Internet.  You mix ricotta cheese, mozzarella cheese, a little parmesan cheese, one egg, and thawed chopped spinach and salt and pepper to taste.  Get a bottle of marinara pasta sauce (or a flavor that your boyfriends would enjoy.)  <br>  <br>  After you cook the shells, drain the water and rinse with cold water to stop the cooking process.  Place about a tablespoon of cheese mix inside the shell.  Place the shell in a lasagna-sized dish or an 8" square pan.  Spray the dish with non-stick spray, and place some sauce in the bottom of the dish.  Set each shell in the dish, with the opening up.  Cover the shells with sauce.  <br>  <br>  Buy a salad in a bag, some nice salad dressing, and if you like garlic bread, that would be tasty.  If you drink wine, get some of that, too.  Go a step further, and have candles.  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps you.

If you know how to do a pepper or mushroom sauce (gravy) for your steaks that accompannies what you have well.<br>  <br>  Your whole baked potato, should go into the oven first at least half an hour before you do your steak. Your potato should be basically cooked before you cook your steaks. I wash the potato, a light coat of oil, wrap in foil and place in the oven at 350 to 400F, after 30 minutes check with a skewer. If your able to pierce the potato with some ease, take them out, unwrap from foil cut 1/2" off one side, scoop out the flesh leave about 1/4" inch around the case (skin), with a fork mash the potato with butter, then add 1/4 cup of shredded cracker barrel cheese, I use a sharp Jack cheese, at times I add bacon bits also. Spoon flesh back into the case, put the hat on and place the potatoes back in the warm oven, the cooking process is completed. <br>  <br>  While you have been waiting for the potatoes to cook, to save time you should have your salad ready, and your dressing ready to be added at the last minute. My dressing is a tablespoon of Balsamic. level teaspoon of dijon mustard, pinch of sea salt, and freshly ground black pepper, commence to whisk together and add roughly two tablespoons of Extra Virgin Olive Oil. <br>  <br>  Now cook your steak omce cooked your ready to serve, remove your potato, add a dollop of sour cream, and a sprinkle of chopped chives. And plate it with your steak.<br>  <br>  Dress your salad by adding the dressing you just made,and leave in salad bowl with a pair of tongs or serving spoons.<br>  <br>  Your wine, I would recommend an Australian red wine I just been introduced to, when you go to buy it, it should cost no more than $17.00, it has a yellow label, called Wolf Blas, it is not sweet nor dry. You can get that slight background of the fruit of the wine.<br>  <br>  Don't forget the long white candles or red candles, and maybe dress the center of the table with a little arrangement of flowers.<br>  <br>  Desert, I would just go with a store bought melon or orange sorbet, coffee and nice Tawney Port to finish the evening.<br>  <br>  Good luck girl.<br>  <br>  Chris|`|BjCREgDXaa	What about a crab meat stuffed lobster for the two of you? <br>  <br>  Food network has a good recipe for you.

1KeJEHvYaa	Well because the mixture for frappuccino is actually a powder mixture that they mix with milk and or half and half, only when you order it is when the ice is added and they frap it up for you (my husband worked at Starbucks). To make it at home all you need is a blender for the machinery and a coffee maker. Make your coffee a little bit stronger than how you like it, cool it down to room temp just make sure it's not hot, put into blender add coffee, milk or half and half, sugar. If you'd like flavoring try extracts like vanilla or if you can get those gourmet coffee syrup add ins or flavored coffee. Just blend it till you think there's not many ice chunks. I can't tell you the amount of ice to coffee ratio to add, that's all on you to your liking. Good luck and enjoy.|`|ayMYfxcfaa	Sometimes when I have leftover brewed coffee, I'll let it cool and pour it into a clean jar with a scoop or two of vanilla ice cream, then close the jar.  <br>  <br>  I've done this in the morning and by afternoon it is nice, or I'll shake the jar to make it smoother.  More ice cream is more shake-like, less ice cream makes a thinner beverage.  I'm sure espresso would work as well as brewed coffee, but I've never tried it (I never have leftover espresso, actually... there's not enough).  It makes a nice treat.|`|e7961f3810d3e7b99d141a982ba1928aaa	I do a pretty simple (and tasty) version:<br>  <br>  Brew a pot of super-strong coffee, let it cool.  Add to blender with ice, and some flavored liquid creamer.  Blend.   Very simple, and tastes damn close to a frap!  :D

76652fe766b064dedfef1f9a09de248faa	The term "dog" has been used as a synonym for sausage since at least 1884 and accusations that sausage makers used dog meat date to at least 1845.[12]<br>  <br>  According to a popular myth, the use of the complete phrase "hot dog" in reference to sausage was coined by the newspaper cartoonist Thomas Aloysius "TAD" Dorgan around 1900 in a cartoon recording the sale of hot dogs during a New York Giants baseball game at the Polo Grounds.[12] However, TAD's earliest usage of "hot dog" was not in reference to a baseball game at the Polo Grounds, but to a bicycle race at Madison Square Garden, in the The New York Evening Journal [December 12, 1906], by which time the term "hot dog" in reference to sausage was already in use.[13][12] In addition, no copy of the apocryphal cartoon has ever been found.[14]<br>  <br>  The earliest usage of "hot dog" in clear reference to sausage found by Barry Popik appeared in the 28 September 1893 edition of The Knoxville Journal.[13]<br>  <br>  It was so cool last night that the appearance of overcoats was common, and stoves and grates were again brought into comfortable use.

khXGGBiTaa	Usually only the low-fat or no-fat yoghurts have gelatin in them. It's probably added because of the texture. Low-fat and no-fat yoghurts, without a thickener, would be too liquidy compared to normal, full-fat yoghurt, and thus less attractive to customers. I think it's the same deal with most brands of thickened cream (there are only a few that use vegetable gums for thickening). It limits the choice of dairy foods almost as much as looking for cheeses that don't contain rennet.<br>  <br>  If you're only worried about PORK skin/bones, then look for a yoghurt that specifies "halal gelatin" which is made from other animals than pigs. Otherwise, buy full-fat yoghurts!|`|lcuxD3qlaa	Yogurt is a dairy product produced by bacterial fermentation of milk.

They aren't chewy like traditional commercial pretzles but they were like a flaky pretzel. But like I said sooooo good.<br>  <br>  I guess it is a copy cat recipe for Auntie Annies Pretezels, I've never had Auntie Annies but I sure do like this recipe.<br>  <br>  1 cup milk<br>  1 pckage active dry yeast- I used rapid rise<br>  3 tbsp packed brown sugar<br>  2 1/4 cups flour-plus extra for when you knead it<br>  10 tbsp unsalted butter divided-plus more for greasing<br>  1 tsp salt<br>  1/3 cup baking soda<br>  2 tbspcoarse salt<br>  <br>  1. Heat the milk to 110, pour into a medium bowel and sprinkle in the yeast. Let it soften for aout 2 min. Stir in the brown sugar,  and 1 cup flour with a wooden spoon.<br>  <br>  2.

Commercial chips are very thin and cooked in a way to eliminate any moisture left in the potato.  If you can do that, then good.  If you can't, then I would cook them at the last minute so they remain at the desired crispness.  They should be able to be kept in such a way so as to maintain freshness but to also be ready to be cooked at a moment's notice.  Perhaps frozen?<br>  <br>  I believe that the proper degree of "thinness" will be the key.  I just saw a show about this on "How It's Made" on TV.

UYKJVlZ5aa	You could put the bread in the oven on Broil, but only for a short time, 30 seconds or so.  You'll want to watch it and take it out when it's toasted to the point you want.<br>  Scrambled eggs, you don't have to put milk in at all.  That's a personal preference, not much difference in taste.  You can put all 7 of the eggs in a bowl at once, then beat them with a fork or whisk, just make sure you break all of the yolks.|`|hKlsJgVSaa	Don't use peanut butter, but marergine is fine.

Keep folding them over until they are done.|`|X1ygowVQaa	For the cheese sandwich, I would stick with cooking it on a griddle or skillet on the stove top. You can definitely use margarine, there was a period of time where I was vegan and you can even use vegan spread and vegan cheese and it still tastes phenomenal. <br>  <br>  For the eggs, I never really measure how much milk I use. Not too much or it can actually make your eggs runny. Normally I make 6 eggs and I just do a quick splash. Definitely dont pour milk in. The time for cooking eggs depends on the temperature you are cooking at. It could take 4 minutes or 40 if you have it on low or high. Put the eggs in a greased skillet ( use some butter or Pam spray), put it on medium heat and stay by the stove. Take a spatula and slowly pull eggs from one side to another. You dont want to literally "scramble" them... just pull up the cooked part and let the uncooked part hit the bottom. Eventually it will all be cooked and delicious! Dont forget to season them a little during the cooking process..lil salt lil pepper. Cheese is an excellent addition to throw in at the last minute. And for some kick try throwing in a little bit of salsa, its delicious!

And assuming you're an average-sized male, 6-8 beers will get you up to about .14 BAC. The liver can filter out about .015 BAC per hour, which means that by about 8:00 you'll be mostly sobered up, though not entirely. It also depends on what time you start drinking; I don't know what time zone you're in. It's 11:00 here now. If you start at say 9:00 and have 7 beers, you'll probably be fine.<br>  EDIT: ogloc is wrong. You can DEFINITELY wake up drunk. Sleep does not automatically filter all the alcohol out of your blood. I have woken up drunk more than once. Also, I find that hangovers are not difficult to avoid, provided you don't drink really sugary drinks don't drink on an empty stomach, and drink as much water as you can handle, both while you're drinking and before you go to bed. And after you get up, for that matter.|`|mg9cpJ5Saa	if you go 2 sleep you cant wake up drunk. you might feel like shyt when you wake up but thats about it....ive never heard of anyone waking up "drunk" so i think you would fine for work =]

A girl in my class in school never ate meat simply because she said she didn't like it.  She never had any special diet or supplements or whatever to fill the "meat gap". There's no such thing as a "meat gap" simply because humans do not need meat.  So, don't worry about supplements or whether or not he's getting all the nutrients he needs etc.  Protein is found in everything -- it's the building block of life, you cannot avoid protein, so don't worry about that either. I became vegan for the purpose of enhanced athletic performance, so, speed, muscles, etc. are all in working order without any kind of protein suppliments or powders or fake meats or whatever -- as I said, there is no "meat gap".  Never trade food for pills.  Always use real food as the source for vitamins, minerals, etc.  And move towards whole foods, organic foods, and more raw than cooked foods, local foods, and your own garden, etc.<br>  <br>  That said, I personally include some flax and hempseed oil in my diet as sources of good fats, use extra virgin olive oil for cooking, use nutritional yeast to give sauces and soups that 'chicken' or 'cheesy' kind of flavour, <br>  <br>  Pick up some books such as Becoming Vegetarian or the other called Becoming Vegan.

EMDNVrcjaa	You can also dry the figs in the oven, but you want a temperature no higher than 140°F (60°C). And 115° to 120° (45°C to 50°C) is actually best for fruit. Many ovens cannot be set that low, however, so you may need to find some absolutely safe way to prop the oven door open a little to allow the excess heat to vent. Some people let you go as high as 160°F (70°C), but at that temperature the fruit may actually begin to cook, which is not your goal. Or the surface will dry out before the interior, trapping moisture inside, and leading to the development of mold. At a temperature around 120°, the figs will take between 8 and 12 hours to dry. If you use a dehydrator, follow the manufacturers’ instructions.<br>  <br>  After the figs are dry and leathery, you should “pasteurize” them to kill any insects that may be lurking in the cracks and crevices. You can either heat them in the oven for 10 to 15 minutes at 175°F (80°C) or put them in freezer bags and freeze them for at least four days. (The freezer method is a little less destructive to vitamins, minerals and texture). Afterwards, if you keep them in the refrigerator, they’ll last for 18 to 24 months. In the freezer, they’ll last for 5 to 8 years. <br>  <br>  OR:<br>  <br>  Preparation. Wash and remove stems. Large figs can be halved or quartered. Dry them with the skin down. Pretreatment. No pretreatment is necessary if drying in a dehydrator. Drying temperature. 106 F for 1 to 2 hours; reduce to 130 F until dry. Doneness. No pockets of moisture and leathery.

52cc7aea6be5f841604eaa406ced87e2aa	Well use all the juice that you possibly can and then get some brown gravy or homestyle gravy or pork gravy and mix it with the juice. Brown about a cup of flour with 1/4 oil into a pasty mixture and then add the gravy/juice to it and add water, salt and pepper as needed. You can also thicker it further if needed by mixing up some more flour with a low water ratio and adding it in. But remember that it takes a little bit to cook the flour and thicken up so stop cooking while it's still runnier than you want it because it will firm up. Good luck!

Add some water or wine and allow to boil vigorously, stirring all the while to bring off any residue from the pan (though not recommended with a non-stick pan.) add any dried herbs or Worcestershire Sauce, or mushroom ketchup to add flavour and then add a small amount of sauce flour, or corn flour to thicken.  If you want a really smooth gravy, strain before adding thickener.<br>  <br>  Can I come to yours for supper and I will show you how to do the gravy!|`|uDZZLH0Uaa	if your roasting this meat in the oven cover it with foil before roasting and you should see at least 1/2 cup of drippings if not more in the bottom of the pan. don't forget to put a wire rack in the bottom of the pan before putting the meat in. you want the drippings to fall to the bottom of the pan but you don't want the meat resting on the bottom of the pan as this will make it stick to the bottom. add a table spoon of cooking oil and a bit of water over the entire roast before covering with foil. when its don't remove the roast and veggies etc and put the drippings into a frying pan. add a about 1/2 hot water and then take a table spoon of self rising flour and place it into a cereal bowl and add a bit of cold water to it till its very runny like water stirring the mixture vigorously till mixed well. when your drippings  come to a boil add the flour mixture slowly while stirring drippings at the same time . you may not need all your flour mixture so you have to gage it by eye. this mixture will thicken your gravy so keep an eye on it . if it does get too thick just add a bit of boiling water to thin in to your liking. add salt pepper etc to taste. and enjoy<br>  cheers mystic|`|i4I0cuudaa	Use the vegetable water, pork stock cube and cornflour to thicken.|`|DKw2mBt6aa	bisto?-x
kAfZaLwraa	There is no real "title" there. It falls under the category of semi-vegetarian, which many vegetarians really hate and consider a serious misnomer (kind of like someone who says that they are "almost" a virgin). You could also try "almost" vegetarian. <br>  <br>  It's no skin off my back if someone wants to eat gelatin. If I ran into one (a person who was vegetarian except for gelatin), I'd probably tell them about the vegetarian alternatives to gelatin so they could go all the way veggie if they wanted to.|`|y9tMWuQjaa	I'd say they have more in common with a vegetarian than a carnivore, so we should try and be a bit more inclusive as they're obviously quite interested in our way of life and that's a step forward.|`|8IfePMa3aa	They eat animal products that killed the animal - they're an omnivore.|`|eAobNmUTaa	A hypocrite!|`|AA11525569	they would be called an omnivore or a bullshitatarian in my book<br>  <br>  and dont mind people who still consume animal products such as gelatin so much as people who do so and try to call themselves vegetarian or something of the sort.. thats the one that bugs me.. almost as much as vegans who go back to eating meat and by products.

If anyone wants to know what I really think or if I have secrets, all they have to do is get me liquored up and I start talking.|`|05aKFYl5aa	yes it does|`|utivEuTfaa	Often, yes; your inhibitions are lowered so you end up revealing things that you wouldn't sober. But in my experience, it also causes me to exaggerate. If I'm in a good mood, I tend to be very complimentary towards people. I've told girl friends who I didn't normally think were that pretty that they were "soooo gorgeous!!" and have flirted with guys that I wouldn't normally be interested in.  If I'm in a bad mood (or when I get drunk off hard liquor) I sometimes get mad about things that wouldn't bother me otherwise, or get realllly paranoid. <br>  Bottom line, if a drunk person says something to you, I wouldn't take it any more seriously than I would a sober comment.  You have to know how the person acts when they're sober in order to better evaluate a drunk comment.|`|l2XtZlPUaa	No, it just brings about the primal instincts in people. <br>  <br>  Many people strive to overcome their instincts to achieve the pinnacle of perfect gentlemanliness, drinking destroys such perseverance. <br>  <br>  Are we defined by what we think or our actions?

Often, I will just slice them up really thin and mix them with some onion and scrambled egg.  That's tasty.  Another thing my roommate and I love to make is potato pancakes.  I looked at a few recipes online, and then did my own thing.<br>  <br>  Shred up the potatoes using a food processor and squeeze/pat them with a paper towel so they are mostly dry, then add 2 eggs, some flour, and salt and pepper.  The flour should be just enough to make it into a batter without being thick.  Then get your pan hot, and cover it with maybe 1/4" of cooking oil.  Ladle out some of your pancake batter and spread it thin.  Once it starts getting golden brown, flip it.<br>  <br>  They are delicious with applesauce.<br>  <br>  <br>  Then there's baked potatoes and mashed potatoes-- I like them really creamy and soft, so cook them down a lot, use an electric mixer, and add a lot of milk and butter :)|`|UETAqR8Taa	gosh potato - favourite food.<br>  <br>  I have 3 favourites<br>  <br>  frittata<br>  au gratin - slices then coveredin milk and grated cheese<br>  baked in the oven<br>  <br>  special augratin - potato layered, then onion thinly sliced, then cream ,then grated cheese, then potato onion,cream,cheese,potato, breadcrumbs and parmesan on top baked till browned.<br>  yum|`|JITTMjasaa	I like red potatoes cut in 4ths with baby carrots, celery, onion, garlic, rosemary, paprika, salt, and pepper.

5zNwBQZHaa	Yes, it is cheaper to use than sugar plus it has some properties that help a product retain flavor for longer periods without changing.

The beef is almost baked dry, and the celery and carrots are quickly stir fried in the hot, spicy oil and the whole thing mixed together. This is very spicy, and very high in what I call the "Yum!" factor–it's one of those things you want to linger over. Adapted from Irene Kuo's Key to Chinese Cooking.... More <br>  <br>  <br>  1 lb. shredded beef<br>  Marinade:<br>  4 T. dark soy sauce<br>  1 T. dry sherry<br>  1 t. sugar<br>  1/2 c. oil<br>  4 dried chilis (I use 9)<br>  2 c. shredded celery stalks<br>  1/2 c. shredded carrots<br>  1 t. salt<br>  2 t. sesame oil<br>  1 t. szechuan peppercorns, roasted and ground<br>  <br>  Mix the marinade ingredients until the sugar is dissolved. Put the beef in a bowl, add the marinade, and stir until all the beef is coated. Refrigerate for an hour.<br>  Heat a wok over a high flame until smoking hot. Add 5 T. of the oil and swirl. Stir the beef to separate, then add it to the wok. Over high heat. stir and flip the beef for about five minutes, until all of the liquid has evaporated. Turn the heat down to medium-low and flip the beef about 5 or 6 minutes: The beef will look moist, but change consistency until it seems "chewy." That's when it's done. Drain and reserve, discarding the oil in the wok (you probably want to rinse the wok out and dry it, by the way–it's kind of a mess if you don't).<br>  Open the kitchen windows and turn on the fan. You've been warned.<br>  Add the remaining 3 T. oil to the wok, still over medium-low heat (this seems to reduce somewhat the chili fumes), and add the chilis. Flip them around until they are black, turn the heat high, add the vegetables and salt. Flip in the hot oil for about 1 1/2 minutes. Return the beef to the wok, and cook with the vegetables for another 30 seconds or so. Add the peppercorns and sesame oil, mix well, and serve.<br>  <br>  Spicy Orange Beef Recipe<br>  <br>  This is one of my favorite stir fry recipes.

mfhuNmBSaa	una de nuestras recetas favoritas en argentina son las empanadas de atun (mis preferidas)<br>  ingredientes:<br>  <br>  Para la masa<br>  <br>  - Un paquete de tapas para empanada para horno.<br>  - O, si se quiere preparar masa casera :<br>  - 750 gr. de harina común, una taza de<br>  - Grasa vacuna, una taza<br>  - Sal gruesa, 2 cucharadas<br>  - Agua hirviendo.<br>  <br>  Para el relleno<br>  <br>  Atún fresco, 1k<br>  Cebolla, ? k<br>  Ají morrón colorado grande, 1<br>  Huevos, 3<br>  Aceitunas verdes, 150 g<br>  Una varita de apio, una zanahoria, dos puerros, perejil, orégano, tomillo.<br>  Sal gruesa, un pu?adito.<br>  Aceite de oliva, 3 cucharadas<br>  Sal y pimienta, a gusto<br>  <br>  Preparación<br>  <br>  De la masa<br>  <br>  - Hacer una pirámide con la harina sobre la mesada, con un hueco en el medio.<br>  - Preparar una salmuera con el agua hirviendo con dos cucharadas de sal y dejar enfriar un par de minutos.<br>  - Derretir en una sartén profunda la grasa, dejar enfriar un poco pero sin que solidifique.<br>  - Echar en el hueco de la harina la grasa y algunas cucharadas de salmuera. Mezclar rápidamente, echar más salmuera si es necesario, hasta lograr unir toda la harina.<br>  - Trabajar hasta que se enfríe. Queda una masa bastante dura, hay que trabajarla para que gane elasticidad.<br>  - Estirar con palote bien fina, cortar discos con cortapastas o un platito de taza de té o similar.<br>  <br>  Del relleno<br>  <br>  - Colocar en una olla tres tazas de agua.<br>  - Incorporar el apio, la zanahoria, los puerros, perejil, orégano, tomillo y la sal gruesa, calentar y dejar hervir unos 10 minutos<br>  - Agregar el atún y cocinar unos 15 minutos.<br>  - Retirar, separar la carne del atún y cortarla en trozos peque?os.<br>  - Guardar el caldo para alguna otra preparación.<br>  - Pelar y picar las cebollas.<br>  - Quitar las semillas y nervaduras del ají morrón y picarlo.<br>  - En una sartén calentar el aceite y rehogar el ají y las cebollas hasta que estas transparenten, agregarles un poco de sal mientras se cocinan para que las verduras arrojen sus jugos y no se quemen.<br>  - Incorporar el atún y cocinar 5 minutos.<br>  - Descarozar las aceitunas y cortarlas en tercios o cuartos.<br>  - Hervir los huevos durante 10 minutos (huevos duros), pelarlos y picarlos.<br>  - Agregar al relleno las aceitunas y los huevos.<br>  - Colocar relleno dentro de cada tapa de empanadas, mojar los bordes, cerrar las empanadas aplastando los bordes con un tenedor.<br>  - Colocar en una fuente para horno untada con aceite y cocinar las empanadas de atún en horno moderado durante 15 minutos aproximadamente.<br>  <br>  Servir calientes|`|1a55863870af2317c5aaaa1080ee1286aa	todo lo q tiene que ver con Mariscos son una delicia mmmm ya se me antojaron|`|2efd65d9c9c3c91f9136865b143732e4aa	En Chile, pescado frito, (merluza) el pescado se parte por la mitad se puede o no sacar las espinas, se remoja en jugo de limón ali?ado con ajo, orégano y comino, luego lo pasas por huevo batido con cilantro y después por harina, luego se fríe por ambos lados acá en Chile con aceite de maravilla, o si prefieres a mi me parece más rico con Oliva.

miCJLOHYaa	Hey. Hey. Not all of us are mean. It's just the Vegans. They don't know the joy of ice cream. THE WORLD WOULD BE A BETTER PLACE IF EVERYONE KNEW THE JOY OF ICE KURREEEEEEAM.<br>  <br>  *cough*... That was partially a joke.<br>  <br>  I actually can't handle the protein... so if I eat meat I get sick.  <br>  Not like I ate it much anyways. I just don't.

THAT TOFU STUFF IS NASTY.<br>  <br>  There are bitchy players on each team though.<br>  <br>  *rofl, yea, I'm a picky vegetarian*<br>  <br>  Let's all sit down.. maybe say thanks to the cows.. and chow down on some sweet sweet ice cream? Sounds like a plan, okay, let's go! Woo!<br>  <br>  -Edit- <br>  Also, I'd like to point out that mud is rather cleansing on the skin. That's why we put it on our faces. Besides, it's much more gross that worms come out of their skin when you cut them open. The dirt's nothing compared to that.|`|Do2EkYvvaa	I made it a challenge lol many people told me I could stop eating meat so I decided to stop eating meat from one day to the other just to prove them wrong and prove to myself I could<br>  <br>  I have been a vegetarian for a year and 3 months now and  just this month I turned vegan for that same reason...its been harder but its possible<br>  <br>  So for me it was just a challange to see if im mentally strong :D<br>  <br>  O and im not the mean vegans lol cause I don't really do it for the animals XD|`|8a6a86c246f925349decf9ddd0a5a907aa	Because meat tastes like shioooot.<br>  <br>  I don't really care about the animals or any of that.

Not everyone in the world will be a parent so having kids and raising them is a waste of time. <br>  <br>  Just because someone doesn't believe in something doesn't mean its a waste of time for someone else.|`|OyBuEpOTaa	They are mean because they haven't evolved.|`|i2jNoGIKaa	I think that you are being unfair.

The reason why we don't give up is because if we did, then there would be even more harm being done to the animals. We don't want to give our money to the meat industry and support the cruelty that they cause. But continue down your path and head straight to heart disease, diabetes, stroke, and cancer. I hope you enjoy which ever one of those you get just as my as I enjoy a healthy veggie burger. Cheers!|`|YSsfesMyaa	I'm a vegetarian because the texture of meat and the taste make me feel sick.

I disagree with how chickens are debeaked, forced to live in small cages, and are then slaughtered when they do not produce eggs fast enough. <br>  <br>  I also disagree with the crowded and stressful environments animals are forced into; and <br>  the hormone-laden feed used to make them grow faster <br>  and produce more. <br>  <br>   <br>   I draw ethical boundaries in certain spots,  I am a  staunch vegan I wont consume yeast, wear wool, or even eat certain <br>  vegetables, such as carrots, that require killing the plant to harvest. <br>  <br>   it conflicts with my  dietary preferences. <br>  I simply do not like the texture <br>  and taste of meat; I also do not eat it because it is high <br>  in cholesterol and often contains high concentrations <br>  of hormones and preservatives. <br>  <br>  I also  cite <br>  environmental reasons for not consuming meat. I complain <br>  that the consumption of meat causes farmers to continually <br>  deforest land to create grazing land for cattle.|`|khXGGBiTaa	"Mean?" That's all a question of perception. I prefer to use the term "sarcastic" as it's a more accurate description of what I am.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure I follow your line of thinking: "i mean the whole world is never gonna be veg. so just give it up!!" - Try saying the same thing to the fundamentalist Christians and Muslims (about their choice of religion) and they'll lynch you. Say it to a gangsta cRapper about his choice of career "i mean the whole world is never gonna be cRap fans, so just give it up!!" See what that gets you. You're lucky you're picking on vegetarians and vegans, because at least we're not as violent as the other examples I gave.<br>  <br>  I think the "waste of time" was in you posting the question, me reading it and me replying to it.|`|KZ30PZZvaa	I personally don't want to support animal cruelty. It's terrible how the animals are treated and don't wan't to eat something that has been hurt in such a terrible way. <br>  <br>  I don't know how many vegetarians you have met or if you are just thinking of stereotypes and what not, but the only vegetarians I have met and nothing but nice. I don't really think that not eating meat can define you as being mean. Some people would think that by not eating meat, we are being nice. Nicer to animals. <br>  <br>  But hey, that's just me.|`|mJREgoWSaa	I'm not a 100% vegetarian because I still eat a bit of chicken, fish, and seafood. I only eat them to please my family because they're afraid that I don't get enough protein (which is not true of course because I get my protein from beans, tofu etc. They'll never understand this though...) It's beef, pork, lamb.....that I wouldn't go near. I personally don't concern too much for the animals honestly, it's just that I don't want to consume all those poisonous dead proteins and have my body digest it and then absorb every bits of it. I actually don't even think that's right for any human body. I don't think our body has the ability to fully breakdown what was once a warm-blooded living creature.<br>  <br>  Cause' you are what you eat!!<br>  <br>  Besides, I find better skin and health from not eating red meat!|`|y9tMWuQjaa	I don't really know?<br>  <br>  Meat = expensive, high in fat, animal cruelty, makes me feel ill touching it, it expires faster than vegetables, and generally I think evolution didn't intend us to have access to animals at every meal. We're not hyenas but we eat like them! I like the taste of vegetables more, and I think substituting a veggie for a bit of meat offers more nutritionally.<br>  <br>  I blame it for cancer and heart disease rates. I am trying to keep my diet as natural as possible, with the odd treat of course. I want to stay healthy for as long as possible. <br>  <br>  Another reason is that I find it easier to get my 5-a-day without meat.|`|494f917287bcb72589c802dc7322ca19aa	guys being mean is not our fault it's part of our DNA, it dates back to the cave man ages, and people that want to take it slow in life turn to veggies Haven't you watch a turtle :)|`|y5Dx7OBVaa	BECAUSE SHE IS VEGAN AND I LOVE HER !|`|DHiqm9Ojaa	I'm not a vegetarian, but I know that you need to calm down.

I really like the Tramontina stock pots and have them in about every size they make.  Real heavy bottoms and good solid pots.  It takes awhile to get one cooking but once they are going, they hold the heat so well you can turn a 22 qt stock pot down to low and still have a good simmer.<br>  <br>  Brand names are sometimes not what they're cracked up to be.  Buy pans by construction, feel and how you cook.  You want 18/10 stainless, riveted handles, helper handles on heavy skillets to name a few things.  A non-stick saute pan or two isn't a bad thing either.  I just prefer the stainless.....|`|O0AfxH9Eaa	Mine are Cuisinox and they are fab.

The hen makes up for this by adding a natural coating, but the government insists that eggs be washed and sanitized before being sold, which washes away the coating. The egg processor sprays on a thin coating of an odorless natural mineral oil to reseal the egg. But your cooking washes this coating away, as well, leaving a drafty shell once more, which is susceptible to the invasion of odors, off-flavors, and bacteria.|`|hKlsJgVSaa	Well shelf life is not really the right term.<br>  <br>  But I have kept mine for weeks and had no problem  with taste or bacteria.<br>  <br>  I would say about 2 weeks.|`|OAEuYZkZaa	I would not keep it more than two or three days and definitely discard it if it has been in the refrigerator a week.<br>  <br>  Doc|`|tMK9abumaa	One week, in the refrigerator.

Easy would be what you have.  Brown the sausage like you would ground beef. Make the gravy according to the package directions and there ya go.<br>  <br>  However, if good is what you want it's best to start from scratch on that gravy.  Country gravy or Milk gravy is not really that hard to make.  First what you need is some of the grease left over after frying the sausage (about 2 Tbls or so), about 1/2 cup of all purpose flour, milk, and salt & pepper.  In a medium to large DEEP skillet add the sausage grease.  Start adding the flour a little at a time to the grease mixing it together until you have a crumbly kind of paste.  Now turn on some heat.  This is one of the tricky parts.  You want to keep this grease and flour mixture moving in the skillet.  This allows the mixture to brown but not become chuncky.  When the flour mixture is a dark golden brown remove the skillet from the heat.  Now pour in the milk while stiring the mixture at the same time.  This prevents the milk from clotting and the flour mixture from lumping on you.  As far as how much milk...pour in milk until the skillet basicly stops sizzeling.  Now stir until the flour mixture and milk are well combined (you shouldn't have any flour lumps).  Return the skillet to the heat: stir CONSTANTLY.  When it begins to thicken, turn your heat down to a medium/low; continue stiring.  Add salt and pepper to taste; continue stiring.  When the gravy is just slightly thinner than you want it to be turn off the flame & add the amount of the fried sausage you want.  Have your biscuits ready and spoon or ladel the gravy over the biscuits.  The gravy will continue to thicken up a little more as it cools.<br>  <br>  Now I know that sounds like a major task but truely it isn't as bad as it sounds.  Each time you make it it becomes easier too.  I first learned to make this when I was 6 yrs old.  It is also good served over soft fried potatoes.  The most noticable difference between real country gravy and the package stuff is taste.  The package stuff usually tastes a lot like paste.  The reason the real stuff doesn't is because of the browning the flour.  Good luck!!|`|B3NfKQHJaa	SAUSAGE GRAVY  <br>  <br>  1 lb. reg. sausage<br>  Salt and pepper to taste<br>  1 tbsp. sugar<br>  3/4 c. flour<br>  4 c. milk (more or less depending on desired consistency)<br>  <br>  Fry sausage until crumbly.

Cook the sausage and leave the grease in the pan. Then add  little flour and stir until it makes a paste..which is called making a Rue. When you have the paste add milk and stir it to make sure all the lumps are out, the mixture will start to thicken as it boils, season the mix with salt, pepper and your cooked sausage and remove from heat when it gets to the desired consistency, if it gets too thick add a little more milk. The whole process takes less than 5 minutes.|`|YrnCZ2Abaa	smush up the sausages until they turn mushy.... yum sausage gravy...chunk chunk|`|OAEuYZkZaa	First thing you do is throw the gravy mix in the trash.  It is nothing more than seasoned flour that has been sitting on the shelf for months.  You can season your own flour much more cheaply and it will taste better.<br>  <br>  Then crumble your sausage in a heavy skillet and brown it over medium high heat.<br>  <br>  Remove the sausage and to the drippings add enough all-purpose flour to make a thin paste.  Turn the heat down to medium or medium low.  Use a whisk to stir it constantly.  Cook the flour for a couple of minutes.  If you want a brown gravy you can continue to cook until the flour begins to color and add water for a brown gravy.  For a white gravy, do not cook until the flour starts to change color.  Add milk and constantly whisking bring to a boil.  Turn the heat down, return the sausage to the gravy  and simmer the gravy until it is the thickness you desire.<br>  <br>  Doc|`|PxJXJKCpaa	That depends on your gravy mix.  Brown your sausage and follow the directions on the package.  I love country gravy with sausage, but I know how to make my own as well.  Hope you have Grands for the bickits.  They rock with sausage gravy.  Add a tad of beef boullion to your gravy mix for a real kick a** full flavor gravy.

oLj0VTX5aa	For rice, you need a large bowl - it really depends on the amount of rice you are making, but you want to use 1.75 times the amount of rice of water, so for example, 2 cups of rice will require 2 1/2 cups water.  <br>  <br>  You will need a bowl that is twice the amount of rice, at least, because it will boil over in the microwave.  <br>  <br>  If you are cooking 2 cups (which is what I used in the past), it will need to cook for 12-13 minutes, with a microwave safe plate on top, so the steam can escape.  You can add seasonings to the rice, too, first.  <br>  <br>  You want there to be no water in the bowl, so based on the power of your microwave, you may need to adjust the time... <br>  <br>  <br>  When the rice is done, DO NOT REMOVE THE GLASS PLATE for at least 2-3 minutes!!!

HFCS is made by adding enzymes to corn syrup, changing it on a molecular level. <br>  <br>  Adding corn syrup to diet soda would make it sweeter, but I don't think you'd like the flavor much, really. Also, if you're going to do that, it would make more sense to simply by the regular soda instead of diet- you're going to be ingesting sugar and calories anyway, so why buy two products instead of one?|`|ILpp3ncYaa	yes|`|5zNwBQZHaa	Corn syrup and High Fructose Corn Syrup are very similar - both contain a lot of calories because they are almost 100% sugar.<br>  <br>  Diet pop does not contain any kind of corn syrup - but may contain things like Splenda, Nutrasweet, Ace-K, etc as those are artificial sweeteners that do not have calories in them.<br>  <br>  You could try adding corn syrup to diet pop - but I think it would taste overly sweet - not like normal pop at all.<br>  <br>  Does that help?

3kZN4T7caa	That would be awesome! =)|`|llkSmgLJaa	It takes 5 to 8 times more land to feed a meat eater then it does a vegetarian. If the USA went Vegetarian we could replant forests and still have enough extra land to grow corn (ethanol) for powering out cars, and and become energy independent.<br>  <br>  FYI: I'm for freedom of choice, but when and if the government takes over health care meat eaters should start to worry. Meat will be taxed like cigarettes and there will be no more farm subsidies.|`|Vi8RDbhUaa	I'm sure that we could sustain our population with vegetables if we stopped farming meat. However, the VAST majority wouldn't even consider the thought of not eating meat including myself. So, It really is a mute point, but interesting none the less.  I hope you're not saying that I shouldn't be able to make that choice for myself?|`|wlEBP4HEaa	25 gallons of water to produce 1lb of wheat & 2500 gallons to produce 1lb of meat <br>  1 acre yields 165 lbs of beef or 20,000 lbs of potatoes <br>  If everyone went vegetarian upto 90% of land used for animal farming could be taken out of production & used to replant woodlands, leisure activities etc.|`|fHG29qT4aa	I don't think those stats are right because I have seen lots of slaughter houses and cattle ranches and they are not that big to support that much growth not to mention all the equipment that is needed for farming like a combine for instance that cost $100,000.00 for a cheap one. it is hard to say but you can get a good chunk of this info from the agricultural department at your state collage or the F.F.A future farmers of america. that might be a good place to start.|`|MqYG3oFJaa	even if it did have an effect on the amount of crops produced, you could always grow more crops. It would mean more farms but that would equal to more jobs for jobless people.|`|CDyHU3Qaaa	most of the vegetarian people I know look skinny and sickly so I would think not|`|96djwZCgaa	Your friends are living in the 19th century, or earlier.  <br>  <br>  Sure, it used to be that one could graze cattle on land that was unfit for growing crops.  Back then, therefore, ranching was the only efficient use of such land.  With modern irrigation, fertilization, pest control and other farming techniques, however, much more land is arable then in previous centuries.  <br>  <br>  People's  image of cattle grazing peacefully on a hillside is no longer an accurate one.  The truth is, most meat is "factory farmed" and most of the soybean and corn (maize) production goes to feeding cattle and pigs, not for human consumption.  So we would require less land for farming if everyone went vegan, not more.|`|kSZstQ6Paa	i don`t know if the animals could survive my answer is all i have|`|0eef821e877b14d3114ed09c28394a80aa	Factory farming is wasteful, pollutive and 6 mo's worth of showers to produce 1 stupid 1lb. of beef. It would also have the environmental impact of driving your car 25 miles in your car. Also the grazing land could be used for growing crops. Going veg saves 3 acres ost being cut down to raise cattle each year per person....If the whole U.S. went vegetarian a lot less ppl. in 3rd world countries would go hungry b/c the U.S. takes an unbelievable amount of the world's resources like 40%......That's just a *little" unfair don't you think?.....If anything is a sin to me, it's waste & waton gluttony, esp. at the expense and detriment of others & the planet.|`|NRvTj9gJaa	There are too many variables to answer this accurately.  First, what do you plan to do with the animals that are already here on earth?  If you plan on castrating all the males, so that they can't reproduce, your plan *might* work (but, you can't really be for animal rights if you decide to eliminate the existence of a species, now can you?).  However, if all of the world's current animals are simply put into the wild and allowed to live their natural lives in nature, then no, the world can not be sustained on vegetation only.   The reason for this is, those animals will reproduce, and if they are not being killed for food, their numbers will eventually exceed current numbers.  Then, these animals will ravage crops looking for something to eat.  Also, overpopulation will lead to sickness and disease, which is much, much more horrible than death by butchering.<br>  <br>  Not to mention, much of grazing land is not suitable for growing crops (rocky, mountainous, forest, etc.)  Yes, the land can be changed to make it crop land, but it's not good for the environment to do so.

xrRZeROmaa	pfannkuchen, or Berliners  (In Berlin, they are called Pfannkuchen.  Outside of Berline, they are simply called Berliners)<br>  <br>  <br>  BERLINER PFANNKUCHEN<br>  <br>  30 grams (1 oz) fresh yeast<br>  about 3/4 - 1 cup warm milk<br>  70 grams (2.5 oz) sugar<br>  400 grams (14.1 oz) flour<br>  2 eggs at room temperature<br>  65 grams (4 1/2 tablespoons) soft, unsalted butter<br>  grated zest of 1/2 lemon<br>  1 dash salt<br>  strawberry jam<br>  oil to fry the Berliner in<br>  fine granulated sugar<br>  <br>  Break the yeast into small pieces into a bowl. Dissolve the yeast and some sugar in some tablespoons of the warm milk.<br>  <br>  Sift the flour into a big bowl, form a crater in the middle of the flour, fill the yeast-milk into the crater and dust some flour onto the mixture. Let rise for several minutes in a warm spot.<br>  <br>  When you see cracks in the flour you dusted onto the yeast mixture, combine the flour, yeast mixture, eggs, butter, lemon zest, salt, sugar and as much milk as the dough absorbs without getting to thin (so it might be best to spoon in the milk as you knead the dough so you can see when you added enough to have a smooth dough). Knead the dough until it stops sticking to the walls of the bowl. Butter the bowl and roll the dough in the bowl to cover it with a thin film of butter. Leave the dough in the bowl, cover the bowl with a clean dish towel and let rise in a warm spot until double in bulk.<br>  <br>  Briefly knead the dough again.<br>  <br>  IF YOU WANT TO FILL THE BERLINER BEFORE DEEP-FRYING THEM:<br>  On a flour-dusted board or table roll out the dough to 1 cm (2/5 inch) thickness. Using a biscuit cutter with a diameter of about 8 cm (3 inches)cut into rounds.   Place half of all the dough rounds onto a board and place a little bit of jam into the middle of these dough rounds. Moisten the edges of the rounds with some water and place the remaining half of dough rounds onto the prepared rounds. You should end up with something like "raw dough sandwiches filled with some jam". Cover them with a clean dish towel, place them in a warm spot and let rise again.<br>  <br>  Heat the oil to 180oC (360oF). Place 2 - 3 of the risen dough rounds into the oil at a time (more dough rounds placed into the oil at one time would lower the temperature of the oil to much, so stick to 2 - 3 at a time). Fry the Berliner doughnuts until golden-brown turning them only once while frying them. Remove from the oil, let oil heat up to ideal temperature, before placing more dough into it again.<br>  <br>  Drain the fried Berliner on paper towels and roll them in sugar while still hot.<br>  <br>  IF YOU WANT TO FILL THE BERLINER AFTER YOU FRY THEM:<br>  You proceed almost as said before, only roll out the dough thicker and omit filling half of the cut out dough rounds and placing other dough rounds on them. Instead cut out rounds from the dough and let them rise. Fry them until golden brown, turning them once in the hot oil.<br>  <br>  Drain them on paper towels then fill them (bakers use something that looks like a big metal soap dispenser that is filled with jam, they just insert the nozzle of this jam dispenser into the fried Berliner and press down on the nozzle - as I said looks and works almost like a soap dispenser you have at home - and then they cover the doughnut with sugar.|`|TAgAnfIbaa	try foodnetwork.com|`|3Y2kEMInaa	never heard of that one sorry =(

But, it is their party - you only toiled until your knuckles were raw and you haven't slept in a week and...on the other hand, it's probably your money. Sit your graduate down and come to an understanding before the event and review each person's expectations. Do's, don'ts and I could live with that's. <br>  <br>  BUT Don't get carried away with constant activity. Make sure your the party is a relaxing and fun event with time to socialize.

uauJyxJNaa	I would wait until you are unpacked and set up to entertain.  The entire idea of a house warming party is to show your friends your new digs and break in your new home.<br>  <br>  PS - A July cookout would be PERFECT!!  Three months is not too long.  It gives you enough time to settle in, get things unpacked, painted, etc. if you need to fix a few things up, and will be great weather to celebrate!!  Good luck and sounds like FUN!!|`|eL268hETaa	Until you've unpacked your stereo for music, kitchenwares to hold the food, and have enough chairs for people to sit on... ;-)|`|CDyHU3Qaaa	I would not invite strangers into my house , house warming partys are no longer in vogue, and merely invite theft.<br>   or people may think your trying to show off- not good|`|1AyRPRSOaa	One month|`|hHCdXq0Naa	That depends:)  If you're doing alot of renovating and/or decorating, you'd certainly want to wait until you're done.  So, I'd say that up to a year should be fine.  People shouldn't expect you to throw a party until you're settled in your new home......|`|FhKfyxWlaa	It's tacky as sin to throw yourself your own housewarming party.  You're better off calling it an "Open House", this way people don't feel obligated to show up and give you a gift. Asking for gifts for yourself is tacky...generally people don't give their own birthday parties...get my drift?
56VRs1GFaa	You don't need to get the most expensive ice creams. Look through your paper's grocery store circulars and see what is on sale.You didn't say how many ppl you are inviting, but get enough flavors to make it interesting. Definitly vanilla and chocolate and the rest is up to you. Then get (or make)  hot fudge, hot caramel, strawberry sauces. Whipped cream, cherries, nuts, sprinkles. Some bananas for banana splits. Do you have any sundae and banana split glasses? You can pick these up very cheaply at second hand stores.<br>  <br>  Hot Fudge Sauce<br>  1 (12 oz pkg) chocolate chips<br>  1 (13 oz) can evaporated milk<br>  3 Tbsp butter<br>  <br>  Combine all ingredients in a 2 qt. saucepan. Cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until chocolate is melted and mixture is thick and smooth. Serve warm.<br>  <br>  Strawberry Sauce<br>  <br>  Slice 2 cups strawberries and add 1/2 cup sugar. Let stand 1 hour until strawberries become juicy. Mash lightly with a fork.<br>  <br>  Hot Caramel Sauce<br>  <br>  1 cup of sugar <br>  6 Tbsp butter <br>  1/2 cup heavy whipping cream<br>  <br>   Heat sugar on moderately high heat in a heavy-bottomed 2-quart or 3-quart saucepan. As the sugar begins to melt, stir vigorously with a whisk or wooden spoon. As soon as the sugar comes to a boil, stop stirring. You can swirl the pan a bit if you want, from this point on. As soon as all of the sugar crystals have melted (the liquid sugar should be dark amber in color), immediately add the butter to the pan. Whisk until the butter has melted. Once the butter has melted, take the pan off the heat. Count to three, then slowly add the cream to the pan and continue to whisk to incorporate. Note than when you add the butter and the cream, the mixture will foam up considerably. This is why you must use a pan that is at least 2-quarts (preferably 3-quarts) big.  Whisk until caramel sauce is smooth. Let cool in the pan for a couple minutes. Serve warm.|`|hHCdXq0Naa	Just buy 1/2 gallons of Breyer's, Dreyers (could be Edy's there), Blue Bell or Blue Bunny - whichever is on sale.

Beer is a stand alone drink you do not mix it, that's not what it's made for. Liquor is what you mix, but not beer. And mixing alcoholic beverages is never a good idea, unless you know what you are doing and are following a drink recipe (i.e. mimosa, mojito, mudslide, etc).

xrRZeROmaa	about average.|`|GI27dKIkaa	It's about three times the strength of an average beer !|`|62EycWp5aa	Wine will have alcohol content ranging between 8% to just over 15%.  Fortified wine can have alcohol content over 20%.  Chardonnay is typically between 12% and 13.5%.  So, your 13% bottle is pretty average as far as alcohol content goes.<br>  <br>  .|`|AA10622261	That's the top percentage of alcohol for a normal unfortified wine, it doesn't get any higher because the sugar fermenting yeasts can only produce that much alcohol. <br>  <br>  But fortified wines, sherry has around 15% and ports around 20%.|`|u13dNQz5aa	13% isn't really that strong, more average i think the strongest wines can go up to about 18% but i'm not a massive wine drinker either so my knowledge isn't too good|`|f0cc5e63f059355277741ad22fdfc852aa	Most wines are between 12 and 14%, so 13% is average|`|LJz26gg1aa	Yes. 13% is strong for a white wine. I'll bet it was Australian. Great stuff!<br>  <br>  White wines (unfortified) vary from about 8% to 13% or so.<br>  <br>  !5% is about the maximum possible for an unfortified (fortified wines, like sherry, have alcohol added).<br>  <br>  Hock, as you mention is much less strong and many German wines are under 10% of alcohol. The French call them lemonade and worse!|`|wswcdiiraa	Most white wines are between 11-13%, with the occasional 14%, so your chardonnay was just about average.

102555dc612c1f9848aff8e2810e3e6baa	Hi there, How fun- you are hosting a Passion Party! I am a Passion Party Consultant myself. The first thing I would advise you to do is to speak to your Passion Consultant to see if she has any games planned.The parties alone are fun. Something about a room filled with women, talking about sex and toys- i guess. LOL<br>  <br>  I have a book filled with passion parties games. Perhaps you can work it so while your consultant is taking orders the girls can be playing a few games. This way the presentation itself doesn't take too long. I like to do the "porn star" name game, as a way to break the ice. Pick up some name badges at walmart and as your guests arrive tell them they are not going to be "themselves" tonight, in fact they are gonna be a porn star, make them pick a sexy, dirty word, that starts with the first letter of their name, and put it in front of their regular name. an example would be g-spot gina,...Then make sure that all the girls call each other by that name. I have another came called the lap dance game that is fun too! If you want email me at<br>  karen@yourpassiondiva.com and use the subject games and i will email you some. Too long to post here. I wish you luck with your party. Hope you get lots of great freebies, and if for some reason you don't have a consultant or have a problem, feel free to contact me.
hHCdXq0Naa	Be aware that the average coffee cup is actually only 6 oz (not 8 oz).  For each cup of coffee that you make, you should use 1 TB of ground beans; plus an additional TB "for the pot" for every 4-6 cups that you make.  However, I like strong coffee, so you might want to use a little less:)  It's easiest to buy an actual coffee scoop (less than $1) for measuring...|`|SYTXuwsDaa	The general rule is one tablespoon per cup. Personally, I think this is only a starting point. Experiment until you find the quantity that you like best, and that is the right amount for you.

eL268hETaa	Powerade is not soda and not an energy drink.  It is merely flavored water containing electrolytes like Gatorade.  It does not contain caffeine of energy drinks, and is not carbonated like soda.  Gatorade was developed as a sports drink for the champion University of Florida Gators football team to replace essential nutrients during stenuous activity and prevent dehydration.  If your Gatorade or Powerade tastes salty, then you don't NEED the electroytes.  If it tastes sweet, then your body is telling you that you needed them.  It won't hurt you to drink it, but it may just taste nasty at times.  Keep some on hand for the next time you get sick with the flu or a stomach virus.  It comes in lots of flavors, and you can even get it in cans of POWDER that stays good for years.|`|GqUFQmBkaa	pretty much, and isnt salt and electrolite, soda has salt|`|XbFEFJsgaa	no soda doesnt have electrolytes, and powerade doesnt have nearly as much calories or caffiene or sugar.
AA11077726	It will be very close to that of water.  Maybe slightly more dense due to the sugar it contains.  I'd say maybe 0.95 g/mL vs. 1.0 g/mL of water.

BGuMKW3jaa	I think you should definitely invite the first lot of people...it's a great way to start hanging around with them outside of school if you're not sure why you never do-might break the ice a little and stuff.<br>  <br>  As for the people you haven't seen in 5 months or so, weigh up the pros and cons of having them there-if they've screwed you around think about whether it's likely to affect your party or what kind fo time you have-if it might cause problems then you might wanna just forget about asking them but if you don't think it's relevant to the occasion and they're good fun then go for it...<br>  <br>  The most important thing is that you invite who you WANT to invite and don't be influenced by who you think you 'should' invite...life's too short to spend time with people you don't want to be with!<br>  <br>  Have a good party!<br>  :)|`|tqcvN5laaa	I think it would be great to invite them to your party, i mean why not?<br>  If you're low on people to invite maybe you should look into making more friends and by inviting these people to your party could be a good start.

Also, since there's always a chance that some people won't show up, it's nice to make sure that there is a good amount of people coming.|`|TcO3QxV3aa	if u wanna be popular then hell yeah, if u wanna stay true to urself (i wouldn't) then dont|`|5UmEAE24aa	I say the people from school|`|jv0xjt1Iaa	you can invite me sexayyy.|`|F9Mrquc5aa	the more the merrier and variety is the spice of life .<br>  just make sure you got good music and ample food and drink <br>  and everything will be great.|`|Toqu9lTqaa	Yeah you should, if you want more people at your party including the ones you haven't talked to for 5 months.<br>  My sweet 16 is coming up and im inviting people I don't even talk to on the phone.<br>  The more the better. But in the end its up to you.|`|u5nYlVMxaa	Invite the people from school. It's a chance to get to know them better.<br>  <br>  Don't invite the people who screw you around. I promise you, in the end it will not be worth it.<br>  <br>  <br>  :)|`|iSQkOotZaa	invite everyone :) its better than having them find out later that they werent invited.|`|cqGQcCN8aa	its up to u really
482oQASHaa	Does your city have any  Chinese Restaurant near you.. if your not sure search for them on google..  you could probably find a phone number from them, and they will  deliver food for you. that is if  they do deliver their food. that's why you have to call them|`|qLAI3GG2aa	Do you have a Jimmy John's in the area? They deliver delicious sub sandwiches.|`|jv0xjt1Iaa	ASIANS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|1K8NPRUOaa	most chinese restaurants do deliver free if you are within a certain range such as 4 miles.|`|njHgfl99aa	Try ethnic cuisines.
njHgfl99aa	Vegans can't eat dairy products or anything associated with animals.   Vegetarians can.|`|A5gfxSyzaa	A vegetarian is a person who does not eat meat or slaughter bi-products.  Simply put this is anything that kills an animal.  This includes meats like beef, chicken, pork, bacon, turkey, fish shrimp, clams, etc.  It also includes "hidden" things like gelatin (made from the collegen of dead animals) which is in Skittles, Starbursts, many yogurts, jello, gummy bears, some soups, etc.  Rennet, a chemical from the lining of a calve's stomach and found in many cheese.  Lard.  Beef fat, found in McDonald's fries (this is not an urban legend but a fact confirmed if you e-mail the company) and Hostess products.  Chicken stock, found in many soups (even vegetable soups) and raman noodles.<br>  <br>  Many vegetarians are lacto-ovo vegetarians which means they consume dairy and eggs in addition to vegitation (food that grows like fruits, veggies, nuts and grains.)  Some vegetarians also do not use any products that kill an animal (leather, tallow, etc) but that's not part of the definition strictly speaking.<br>  <br>  Veganism is not just a diet but a whole lifestyle.  It means someone that does not use anything from animals at all.  Not only does this mean the things above that a vegetarian that does not eat but it also means no dairy, eggs, honey, etc.  It means no wool, ivory, fur, etc.|`|YQTBQ5xyaa	Vegetarians do not eat meat but can eat eggs and dairy products.  Vegans cannot eat any animal products, including honey or sugar that is processsed using bone-char.  They won't wear leather.<br>  <br>  There are subcatorgies of vegetarians and vegans:<br>  <br>  Fruitarian- vegan who only eats nuts, seeds and fruit in order not to harm plants.  Hardcore fruitarians eat only nuts, seeds and fruit they find on the ground.<br>  <br>  Raw Foodist- vegan who will not any food heated above 110 F.<br>  <br>  Breatharian:  Only drinks water.  Supposedly, breatharians get their nutrients from the rising sun.|`|8dfca7e2b1f09cef17816b68835e11f5aa	Vegans choose not to eat any products that are derived from animals, including milk, lactose, lard, eggs, butter,cheese, gelatin and honey. They also don't wear fur, wool, angora, mohair, silk, suede or leather.<br>  Vegetarians come in different groups but avoid eating all animals.<br>  Those who "only" eat seafood or chicken are NOT vegetarians!|`|9Zq4VWGDaa	Vegans exclude eggs and other dairy products that are animal made, vegetarians dont.
krgtMHx7aa	Pro choice and vegetarian, isn't that a bit hypocritical?  Don't eat meat, meat is murder, but go ahead and kill your baby because that is your choice.|`|TJOHxhEUaa	Vegetarian for a lot of years and pro-choice.|`|ZhiYghZ1aa	pro-choice,|`|wlEBP4HEaa	I disagree with every single one of you. I do see your point tho.|`|jZRtTpZiaa	I'm vegan.  In the law, I'm pro-choice for being vegetarian or vegan,  and I'm pro-choice with regards to abortion.   I'm also pro-responsibility and pro-education to make sure fewer women ever are faced with making that awful choice of aborting a pregnancy.   That goes for the guys too!  Take responsibility.  <br>  <br>  There are enough people in jail without making everything illegal.  Can you imagine telling a young girl who was raped that she must have the baby of the monster who raped her or else she goes to prison for murder?  I cannot.   But I do not personally believe in abortion, and if I was a woman, would choose to not abort a pregnancy.  You get to make the choice,  But, it's also my right to try to convince you that treating animals horribly on factory farms is wrong, and that abortion is wrong.   Stop eating animals, and stock up on cruelty-free condoms (or else keep your legs together)!  :-D|`|tAR4T60aaa	I'm a vegan, and I'm anti-abortion but pro-choice too. I could never, ever get an abortion myself, but the way I see it, who am I to tell a woman she can't get one? Women are always going to be getting abortions, whether we like it or not. No one can stop them, not even the government.|`|fZEVgFe8aa	Veg but sometimes LOVE-veg and Pro-Choice.|`|W9DnNNjOaa	I'm a vegetarian and pro-choice<br>  <br>  btw? how can you be  anti-abortion but still pro-choice??|`|xuO7wXNSaa	pro-choice|`|eo0DKI0qaa	I'm a vegan and I'm pro-choice|`|3R2eHvpUaa	im vegan and im pro-choice|`|FicyC2TXaa	Nobody is pro-abortion; abortion is a hideous experience that nobody undertakes lightly and that nobody would wish themselves or anyone else to go through - and I speak from experience<br>  <br>  It comes down to pro-choice or anti-choice really, not pro- or anti-abortion.<br>  <br>  I'm 100% pro-choice; the decision to terminate a pregnancy should rest with the pregnant woman and nobody else. And this should be the casewhatever the circumstances of conception - whether it was joyous consensual sex or rape.<br>  <br>   I am strongly in favour of women being in control of their own lives and destinies, and part of this is control over their own fertility.Yes, prevention is better, and education about safe and effective contraception would prevent the need for some abortions. But with the best will in the world contraception sometimes fails. <br>  <br>  I'm pro-choice because I value life - the lives of the thousands of women who would die without legal abortion, and the lives of the countless numbers of women who die when they cannot obtain abortions.<br>  <br>  In countries where abortion is illegal, women have abortions anyway - dangerous, life threatening and sometimes fatal abortions. This used to happen in countries where abortion is legal, and still does where it is legal but in reality hard to get.<br>  <br>  For me it's a class issue too. It is women without the money to buy safe abortions - something wealthy women have always been able to do, legal abortion or no - who died and continue to die. I care about their lives so I'm pro-choice.<br>  <br>  I'm old enough to remember the time before abortion was legal in my country, and I remember the whispers about a friend's teenage cousin who died following a botched illegal abortion, and friends par-boiling themselves in hot baths because they feared they were pregnant.<br>  <br>  Stories of knitting needles, coat hangers, and other implements being used by desperate women to self-abort are not just horror stories, they are true<br>  <br>  I'm vegan because I choose to minimise my contribution to animal suffering. I'm pro-choice because I value the lives of women and their right to choose. I don't think the two have anything to do with each other, except that I think in both cases my views are humane, compassionate ones
CDyHU3Qaaa	toxin is in the hair, not on the hair so no kind of wash is going to hide anything.  there is nothing that can be hidden from a hair sample ...nothing. unles the hair is grown and cut after  several months|`|EGnDovaqaa	no that wont work, ive tried that BS<br>  <br>  you gotta rub dry ice over your hair and pubes, dry ice is scientificaly proven to remove alcohol toxins
9Zq4VWGDaa	Why would you want to drink warm salt water? You should use it to gargle when you have a sore throat as it kills the bacteria. Salt water is nasty tasting which maybe why it makes you want to throw up..

DomvY3gdaa	change labels or you going to be in trouble|`|Wn3LGHTvaa	You can but bottles are cheap. Go to a place that sells beer by the case; you can buy a case of empties for the cost of the deposit. You just have to clean them very carefully before you sanitize.|`|axxQzOCHaa	Being that homebrews are different than what's in stores, I would get properly sanitized 12 oz bottles from a shop that rents / sells supplies to home brewers.|`|4YKqJquxaa	I have. It worked fairly well, in the sense that our gasoline-beer did indeed brew in the 2L bottles. So, in short, yes, you can.<br>  <br>  But, you're going to have to clean them, sanitize them, and be totally sure that there is no traces of anything left in them. Also, the lids have to be 100% airtight.|`|Gt8o7ICLaa	My uncle loves to homebrew, and he just asks his buddies for all their longnecks, steams em in the dishwasher and reuses them. but i dont think a 2 liter would work. the 40oz might though.
XzLUA7ataa	Generally about six months, not more than a year. Watch for freezer burn (ice crystals forming on the product).  Label items as you store them in your freezer with the date and contents.  Rotate items putting the fresher ones in the back and pulling the previous contents forward.|`|jv0xjt1Iaa	do an expiremtn..and cut off your hair and put it in baking soda and oil then take it out a week later and see how soft it is.|`|k5RVJxliaa	It wont go bad unless its like something that has an expired date like cut vegetables wont go bad if you keep it frozen
