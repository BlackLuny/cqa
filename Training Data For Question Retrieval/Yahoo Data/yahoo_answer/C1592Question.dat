20090219075754AANGUeq	Travel;New Zealand;Other - New Zealand	Internship for recent U.S. college grad?	I'm looking for an internship in New Zealand (possibly Australia) after I graduate with my degree in Recreation and Tourism from my university in May 2010.       I love to travel and have been to NZ before. I was planning a return trip sometime in 2010 and to Australia with a traveling friend from England. But she asked if we could push the trip back to 2011 whenver she graduates: I'm guessing either May or June or whenever U.K. universities get out.       I work for the U.S. park service. My original timeline was graduate May 2010, work for the park service May-end of August, travel NZ beginning at the beginning of September, then do my three month internship required by my university when I got back from NZ and then enter the workforce. This would have been around January/February 2011 that I'd be looking for a permanent job.       But now I'll have to push my career back another 6 months or so. There's no way if I got a job in January that they'd let me take two months off starting in June.       I want to try to occupy my time until June 2011 and was thinking another internship working for a resort or tourist company in New Zealand. I looked for them, but it seems that you have to go through travel companies to find these. They're primarily focused on profits though. For example, the one I found is a company from New York. They arrange interships in New Zealand. But charge nearly $4,000 for four months--this doesn't even include food or housing! Yeah, they do pay you at least $1,200, but that still won't cover my expenses. I'd basically be paying to work! I'm thinking trying to find an actual business in New Zealand such as a hotel or resort and going directly through them and avoiding these American middlemen. Do you have any suggestions how I could find one of these or recommendations of which ones I should look at?       I'd still really like to go on the trip with the British traveling friend. Once I start my career; I'll probably never have the chance to tour NZ or Australia like this again. As long as I'm building my resume and gaining experience I don't mind delaying my career another half year or however long it actually will turn out to be. Plus, it's important for me to have an impressive resume because I have a high functioning form of autism (Asperger's). I do well in college and whatever jobs I have, but my interviewing skills are lacking and can't communicate my ideas as well as other people so I need any advantage I can get. I'm considering any international suggestions and thanks for your help!      The link to the arranged NZ internship which seems like it's a rip-off but the idea I'm looking for:         http://www.workingabroad.org/intern/inte...

I don't why Americans think that and I am American myself.      2) war-weary Canada   I think this is insulting to Canadians it is like portraying Canadians as cowards or the usual insulting jab that Canada does not have an army and depends on the US for protection.      Does this stereotype with the second point more about putting Canada down bother Canadians at all?      Is this why Canadians have this inferiority complex that even Canadians talk about?
