rHwE5Rkbaa	The Coast Guard is one of the five armed forces of the US - but is the only one NOT in the Department of Defense, we're in the Dept of Homeland Security.  Our core mission is keeping people safe - whether we are maintaining buoys on the nation's waterways, doing armed drug interdiction, doing environmental protection, or doing armed boardings of vessels in the Persian Gulf to enforce the UN embargoes... it's all about safety.  We do Search and Rescue and Homeland Security missions stateside as well as overseas.    The biggest thing that sets us apart, is the fact that we are TINY!  With just under 50,000 people, we're smaller than the NYC Police Department (55,000), and even the cast and crew that works at Disney World in Orlando (60,000 employees).  The next smaller service is the Marine Corps with about 180,000 Marines.    I agree with the above, go to www.gocoastguard.com and get the answers for which you are looking.  We're pretty approachable, but be warned that we have significantly higher standards to enlist than the other services.  Our minimum ASVAB score is 46, while the minimum for the other services is about 36.  Annually, we only enlist about 3000 people TOTAL.  We have so many people trying to get in, that we can afford to be more selective than the other services.|`|1bfd6f647a73749c637495a4c269b837aa	The answer to both questions is "Talk to a recruiter."|`|rYNM67oyaa	http://www.gocoastguard.com/|`|BMkVOR0caa	Go talk to a recruiter about joining.|`|u8io9Ecdaa	1 877 NOW-USCG to talk to a recruiter near you    www.gocoastguard.com  www.myspace.com/cg_ro_little_rock_ar  www.uscg.mil

9TXrJ32Daa	The chances of Mass extraditing you is unfortunately slight to none.  I have over my years, stopped or encountered many people that are wanted in the Commonwealth and unless it is extremely violent or unusual, they will not come and get you.  That said, if you decide to go back and encounter a law enforcement officer, the chances of you getting arrested are very good.  With your license, they may have suspended it already so if you go to the DMV in WA and they run you and find that you are under suspension, your problems may just be starting out there.|`|ggpf6AZuaa	yes mass can extradite you be a man and face up|`|HZy629kLaa	Probably not but they may take you to jail in WA if you ever get pulled over if you have an outstanding warrant.|`|9NVexqv6aa	Doubt they would go to the trouble|`|JHO6DlH0aa	When a warrant is issued it is entered into CJIN  by the originating agency / court fnd it will list what the extradition limits are.  You could contact the court and inquire if there is a warrant and what is the extradition limits (if any).  Then you need to stay away from within the limits and you should be left alone.  However, if you get arrested for any other crimes you may not be released on your own recognizance. (OR) because you have a flight history.

Maybe you will get a full picture of what is going on.|`|AA10075828	No. That kind of show has a hard time attracting advertisers. Here where I am, the local AM radio station has had to replace its local version of Hannity with a show selling discounted goods from local vendors. This is that show's last week and over and over again the ultra-right wing host is pleading with listeners to support shows like his so they can survive.    Listen carefully to just how many local, PAID FOR ads are broadcast during Rush, Hannity, etc. They get national advertising (but still not a lot--not on radio), but not much local stuff at all, except in certain southernish enclaves. Truth be told, the numbers aren't really with the far-right. Most listen to those guys for entertainment, not ideas.|`|uGeo5zfSaa	If you don't like it, then watch The People's Republic news network.

I think it's sad and scary that there are those that are going to such lengths as to censor/silence any viewpoints they don't agree with, which is what the Fairness Doctrine is doing. How fascist is that? Talk radio is a branch of the media that is conservative, but most every other part of the media - newspapers, newsmagazines, cable news networks, TV, music, Hollywood - are left leaning. So what in the hell are liberals complaining about?|`|WL3KcegWaa	PSA's are run by the station carrying the program.      Are all liberals smart like you?

It means that Governments do not give a rats azz about its people, the same people that financially support and put Governments into power.    Today we have a figurehead like the one in Egypt--(Pharaoh) The Vatican and The International Bankers (Rothschild) And the British Accreditation Regency, also known as The American BAR Association.    Below that are Pharaoh-like puppets known as Governments.    And Below those are the Governments puppets, all the way down to the last butt kisser. The Military Industrial Complex (M.I.C.)  Too much of a coward to do something to get court marshaled for, picks on the little guy, too timid to get aggressive with the big guy,  usually full of "IT" and has excessive amounts of Uric Acid running around its blood, due from red meats, dairy, peanuts and brazil nuts.  These foods are said to be the   1 "Cause" of Arthritis, and causes stress in the body.    When we get stressed and emotional, we stop thinking clearly. (Disadvantaged)     Their Military Slogan should actually be::  "Join the Military, See new places, Meet new People, and Kill Them!!"  Because thats what they actually do.    I have a friend who is a Vietnam Vet.  He refuses to pay taxes.    He wrote "to whom it may concern-- I will pay taxes if you can give me a 100% guarantee that my tax dollars will not go towards the killing of innocent people, women and children.

As usual, you are misinformed.|`|5d9pCmjyaa	You're stuck between a popular party that does not serve the ideals of conservatism and a marginalized party that does.    But there's hope.    Any time a small party starts to gain momentum, the big two always looks to them to see if they can "steal" a plank or two (and the votes that go along with them).  So even if the libertarian party loses, if they gain enough votes, the GOP will start taking their planks.    Which is what most true conservatives want anyway.|`|35ZJauLkaa	Only if they can convince the dems to pass the liberal side of their platform.

Instead of     nominating a moderate liberal (which McCain was),  next    time they will get a real strong conservative.|`|9FI7zaKraa	I can only hope that the Libertarians can find a pretty face to run. Sad, but elections seem to be about who is "prettier" rather than who is better for the job. Look at the past 3 presidential contenders:  BUSH  1 VS Clinton- Clinton was younger, better looking  Clinton VS Dole- Dole looked 120 yrs. old, face it no contest.  Gore VS Bush2- W, edges out Gore, just as the election was close, so was this beauty contest but Bush wins with personality edge.    McCain VS Obama- Obama younger, in shape, nice smile.  the libertarian candidate was Bob Barr. the  man never smiled, thus he never had a chance. This was the year the libertarians could have really made an impact if only they had a better package to represent the party. If only Walter Williams had of run, we would now have the first real black president, but one that is worthy of the job and very smart.   So i for one hope we can find that "pretty" face with Lbertarian values to help take this country back in 2012.
3MM64geHaa	1. The House Democrats' bill will cost each and every household $6,700 additional debt, paid for by our children and grandchildren.    2. The total cost of this one piece of legislation is almost as much as the annual discretionary budget for the entire federal government.    3. President-elect Obama has said that his proposed stimulus legislation will create or save three million jobs. This means that this legislation will spend about $275,000 per job. The average household income in the U.S. is $50,000 a year.    4. The House Democrats' bill provides enough spending - $825 billion - to give every man, woman, and child in America $2,700.    5. $825 billion is enough to give every person living in poverty in the U.S. $22,000.    6. $825 billion is enough to give every person in Ohio $72,000.    7. Although the House Democrats' proposal has been billed as a transportation and infrastructure investment package, in actuality only $30 billion of the bill - or three percent - is for road and highway spending. A recent study from the Congressional Budget Office said that only 25 percent of infrastructure dollars can be spent in the first year, making the one year total less than $7 billion for infrastructure.    8. Much of the funding within the House Democrats' proposal will go to programs that already have large, unexpended balances. For example, the bill provides $1 billion for Community Development Block Grants (CDBG), which already have $16 billion on hand. And, this year, Congress has plans to rescind $9 billion in highway funding that the states have not yet used.     9. In 1993, the unemployment rate was virtually the same as the rate today (around seven percent). Yet, then-President Clinton's proposed stimulus legislation ONLY contained $16 billion in spending.    10. Here are just a few of the programs and projects that have been included in the House Democrats' proposal:    $650 million for digital TV coupons.  $6 billion for colleges/universities - many which have billion dollar endowments.  $166 billion in direct aid to states - many of which have failed to budget wisely.  $50 million in funding for the National Endowment of the Arts.  $44 million for repairs to U.S. Department of Agriculture headquarters.  $200 million for the National Mall, including grass planting.  $400 million for "National Treasures."  11. Almost one-third of the so called tax relief in the House Democrats' bill is spending in disguise, meaning that true tax relief makes up only 24 percent of the total package - not the 40 percent that President-elect Obama had requested.    12. $825 billion is just the beginning - many Capitol Hill Democrats want to spend even more taxpayer dollars on their "stimulus" plan.|`|6cf45f1e4b4887d9df5323037a43c464aa	http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/01/15...|`|dGNoPSyjaa	Doesnt it feel good to ask this question......the goverment isnt so secretive like they use to be.....I wonder what happened|`|H1yiC98yaa	obunghole says recovery.com will show us the money trail. i just saw it on the news|`|hhJrwRNdaa	Knowing what useless spending will be done will not stop it.

First, you've been lied to and you don't seem to care...so why should we give up tons of taxpayer money to support your foolish choice ?  The experts said the earth only had 20 years left and the oceans only had 10.....20 years later we are the same.  They tell you polar bears are drowning, but 75% of the polar bears actually live in Canada, and the population has quadripled since the 50's.  They show you pictures of receeding glaciers...but neglect to take updated pictures when they expands again.  They tell you the ice sheets are melting but neglect to tell you about the underwater volcanoes.  They will show you a laboratory set up to 'prove' the greenhouse effect, but it hasn' t materialized in the real world.  And that Ozone hole ? they can't explain on the global warming side of the question why it was the largest in 1956 before the use of CFC, but the credible scientists back in the 80's attributed it largely due to the extra cold weather.  The fact is, we, no matter how smart we think we are, can't comprehend the workings of the weather , all the effects and how the planet automatically compensates for things that change.  So if you wish to be ignorant and blieve other people's lies...well...that's your option, but just how long are you going to believe those that openly and can be proven to have lied to you before you question it ?  And if Carbon is sooo bad, why is Al Gore getting so rich by "trading" it rather than reducing it ? Who designated that political hack as the authority to give and take carbon credits ? If we traded "pollution credits" back in the 70's rather than clean up our water and air, things would be just as bad as they were back then.  Don't fall for the hype, get educated.|`|qy9imvEcaa	Al Gore is an idiot Obama is another stooge.

3734b5f7e7c27b91d0268c00d9e7ed41aa	I heard the Obama-mobile, was going to visit my neighborhood, and Obama himself was going to throw pennies and nickels from the passing car, and yell..  "America? This is change WE can believe in!"    Current highlights from the Obama/Democrat approved 'stimulus bill'?    $44 million for repairs at the Agriculture Department headquarters in Washington.    $200 million to rehabilitate the National Mall.    $360 million for new child care centers at military bases.    $1.8 billion to repair National Park Service facilities.    $276 million to update technology at the State Department.    $500 million for the Transportation Security Administration to install bomb detectors at airports.    $600 million for General Services Administration to replace older vehicles with alternative fuel vehicles.    $2.5 billion to upgrade low-income housing.    $400 million for NASA scientists to conduct climate change research.    $426 million to construct facilities at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.    $800 million to clean up Superfund sites.    $150 million for the Coast Guard to repair or remove bridges deemed a hazard to navigation.    $6.7 billion to renovate and improve energy efficiency at federal buildings.    $400 million to replace the Social Security Administration's 30-year-old National Computer Center.    So far? 15.246 Billion of the 'economic stimulus, has already been uncovered as unrepentant government PORK.  Who will bet, that that number will only go up, as the over 600 pages of this bill, that is being streamlined through congress, will end up resulting in more than 100 to 200 billion in overall government WASTE?    But wait? Some will say....  It has been claimed, that this bill, will save or create some 4,000,000 jobs?  Really?  and most of those jobs will pay around $15-30,000 per year, but will cost more than $206,000?    You know?  Barack Obama and the Democrats saying, they want to save America, and bail us out of the economic crisis, sounds so very familiar to O J Simpson, offering a reward to find the "true killer", don't they?|`|xeEOTsyYaa	good luck w/ that...|`|eu6UQElYaa	That's actually pretty clever.|`|aQ8utQOeaa	That would be pretty funny.  Can I send a pink one?|`|JLayHNZCaa	Nope, we (the U.S.) needs this stimulus plan, I just hope it works.|`|4zijn0cgaa	Yes and we could put 2 pennies in them, that is the only way we could get our 2 cents in.|`|qy9imvEcaa	You're on the same page a lot of are.    LOTS OF PORK GOING OUT.|`|HGnWKRzyaa	What will it do exactly?|`|xHcQSLiVaa	amen|`|OLCnQkmBaa	Letters to your Congressmen they have to notice and pay attention to signed constituent letters we vote them in.|`|oOVAbKPmaa	Sure, why not? There are plenty of " swine " there, anyway...|`|MNqwUHypaa	the congress approved that one today. day late and a dollar short, my friend.|`|r6JskEtxaa	And then Barrack Obama could sell them to help the economy. Good Plan!|`|vHpI0M41aa	Hold that thought!  It might ACTUALLY work if everyone contacted their Senators...think?  We do have that capability and if all the whiners would get off their butts and speak up, it's not too late to keep this "stimulus" package from becoming a further burden to the taxpayers.|`|SXeEvt9Qaa	what do you like and dislike about the stimulus package?|`|mgVrAqpkaa	nope.|`|AA10928202	Put on a gorilla mask instead,  Barry might kiss you.|`|wEOJyEw0aa	you would have some money in it if it wasn't for Bush Lets go back to giving Corporations tax breaks it's working so well i can tell  by the unemployment rate|`|rOWMQuVVaa	That'll do it Ray.
BIQrsl4paa	Yep, another way for social leeches to get rich for doing nothing except having even more illegitimate children. Notice that nothing was said about the deadbeat dads?|`|5d9pCmjyaa	Yup, looks like a system in need of some renovations.|`|1219d6000cca01c9f3c4489d1c7b4a16aa	Looks like an example of badly worked out policy that was taken advantage of by some clever people that didn't want to get a real job.    What they did is perfectly legal though, the solution is to patch up the loopholes and hope that lawmakers in all states and the federal government are more careful to not create more such loopholes.|`|hhJrwRNdaa	Just one of the many programs of Liberalism.    When will the American Citizen put a halt to the Liberal's worthless spending.|`|pNKAfY4Eaa	that's three sisters over three years...did you do the math?      $540,000/3 Sisters = $180,000/3 years = $60,000/Sister/Year    Yes, $60k/year is a lot.  But, that is for a total of 17 children.    $60,000/17 Children = $3529.41/child per year.   Now, a child definately costs more than that per year.    $3529.41/52 weeks = $67.87/week per kid.    After food, school supplies, and any after school activities, this really isn't a lot of money.  I'm not saying they shouldn't close the loophole, but when you break it down, it's not as bad as it seems.
AfaFCiKxaa	Amen.|`|AA11598520	Noooo....He APPEARED to reach out to them. Remember the: "I won so it's my way" thing? That cuts off all discussion because what would really be the point if he's not receptive to it? You people will fall for anything, won't you? You, sir, are in La La Land if you honestly believe that package is stimulus. Allow me also point out that there was NO mandate for Obama if he only got 53% of the vote.|`|ioCiw5zlaa	Unsure. When Bush was in office they claimed the president had no power to help or hurt America.    Now that Obama is in office he will destroy humanity, that is according to them.|`|i5F2jwvhaa	thanks for falling for our plan    Now when this stimulus doesnt work( trust me it wont) the blame is 100% on the democrats|`|vHpI0M41aa	The only thing I expected was fiscal responsibility.  I believe that this entire mess was made by people on both sides of the aisle.  But throwing good money after bad has never worked.  What kind of stimulus, for instance, is 500 million dollars for the study of greenhouse gases going to accomplish? And what about the $500 million for federal vehicles?  There's other pork in that "stimulus" bill as well.  Hopefully, it will get drastically cleaned up before becoming a real headache to the American taxpayer.|`|IiPlkjNMaa	The government can't save the economy...this is a stunt to serve the people he elected.    What are bush's failed economic policies?...the economy grew 20% during his tenure, and unemployment was below 5%.    The current economic crisis is a result of the housing crisis...if you can tie that into some legislation that Bush passed during his tenure, then you can blame him...the truth is deregulation of the financial industry has been slowly occuring since the last major recession in 1981 (Glass Steagal Act passed in '99 is a major piece of legislation)    I'm not a big Bush fan, and I was against the initial stimulus package as well & the auto bailout...they're already used up that money and are asking for more...this is a failed policy already.    http://www.data360.org/graph_group.aspx?...|`|1219d6000cca01c9f3c4489d1c7b4a16aa	Where do you get your information?  Yes, he did reach out to them the other day, I've heard nothing but praise from Republicans in congress for Obama's attendance and input.  I would not call that a rejection of his gesture.    Read Pete Hoekstra's twitter page, where he blogs on his experiences as a Republican house representative, read his comments on Obama:    http://twitter.com/petehoekstra    Obama hasn't signed any stimulus bill and I have hope that he will not pass the giant earmark that congressional Democrats are preparing for him.  Either that, or he's a total hypocrite, because he promised us an end to pork barrel politics.    And for all you talk of Bush's failed policies, I bet you can't name one.  If you want to see a failed policy, just wait until they pass this stimulus bill.|`|dGNoPSyjaa	This topic is getting old......it's simple......Obama looked Good...Republicans Look Bad.......Stimulus Does Bad...Republicans Blame Obama......Stimulus Works Well....Republicans Start Blaming Each Other.....as always......in the End Lets Hope America out does China in EVERYTHING|`|0e4fea790f4ea59363811798798d53a0aa	Wow you are an idiot.|`|64SObnr5aa	This is a power play, the repugs were simply saying, we are not going to play ball -- this time.  They had nothing to lose.  The passage of the bill was a forgone conclusion.  That is less apparent in the Senate and the dems and repugs know something will be passed, but what we do not know -- is it going to be loaded with pork, or not?  Is it going to be just a whisper of the house version, or something else?    We simply do not know.    All of the needs be hammered out over the next two weeks if it is going to reach Obama's desk by Feb 15    Time will tell.    I am looking for Obama to continue to reach across the isle, even if the repugs are trying to play a losing game of hardball.    Peace  Jim    .|`|8zelZj3Aaa	The fruits of your victory will soon be apparent. We shall all cry together.|`|bIOf9lv7aa	I am glad they did.. It will be very well publicized that Republicans HAD NOTHING to do with this stimulus.. So in two years, when the country is in absolute ruin,what will CNN, NBC and all the little libbies say then??????   There wont be any Bush to hide behind this time..LOLOLOLOL.. It will ALL be on Obango|`|OAyXEtIoaa	the failed policy here was the liberal backing of the housing industry to push loans on people who couldn't afford them, starting the domino effect of our failing economy.

After that you would be assigned to a hospital, base clinic or on board ship.   All of those facilities have physical therapy.

The secret to success is graduate high school, don't do drugs, and don't get pregnant till you are married.    Poor people are poor because of bad choices in life.    The Capitalist market works just fine, competition allows more choices at lower prices, just look at WalMart, the cheapest prices to help the poor, and $4.00 prescriptions, now the government cannot even beat that.|`|WYPEG8l7aa	Everyone rich today at one point was dirt poor or had an ancestor that was and decided he didn't want his life and the life of his children to be like that forever.|`|DAMZKbpDaa	Most of America's millionaires had parent that were not rich.

Certainly I see that it seems to have been increasing since around the early 70's. The loss of high paying American manufacturing jobs overseas, coupled with the rebuilding  of devastated countries after WW2 are  major factors. I'm no economist, but this all seemed to coincide with the Vietnam war. The billions of dollars we spent there probably hastened this trend. Statistics show the wealth is concentrated more and more into a very small percentage of the population.|`|DlQd0m0Daa	Democrats already have their rich ruling class. Are you in it?

When he entered office it was at 5.7 trillion and when he left office it was at around 11 trillion.

Take your pick.  There will always be poor people, because when taxes go up, people dont work.    Realistically, the choice is not between the poor starving and communism.  For every dollar someone is below the poverty line in america, we spend 15 dollars at the federal level to bring them up.  It doesnt work, clearly, but lets not pretend we are capitalists.  I dont mind aid to the poor, but I dont want a massive government controlled economy.    Every dollar we spend on poverty makes much more than a dollar poorer because it reduces the incentive to work, drives our business to other countries, and does not add to the cumulative compound rate of growth of this country.  Data supports me 100% of the time and you 0% of the time, but you need a degree in economics to know that.    1% of growth isnt a big deal.  But 2% growth makes us twice as rich in 35 years, while 1% makes us twice as rich in 72 years.  Taxes are the death of prosperity for everyone in the long run.    I pay 60% in total taxes.  Most of that goes to social programs.    I disagree with each of your specific arguments, but nobody has time to hold your hand and go through them with you.  What can I say?

This country has never in recent times had pure raw Capitalism.  The closest it got was in the pre-Teddy Roosevelt times when sweat shops 18 hour days and working for pennies on the dollar to get profits for the "Robber Barons" that lived like kings in Newport Mansions in the 1920's.  Markets nowadays are regulated to stop that profit margin via Union wages, and state, federal, and local taxes.  Big businesses CEO's pay 60% of their gross earnings to the tax gods.  America's corporate tax rate is the highest in the developed world.  2.   Socialism puts us all in a forced pay scale, but people say why bust my a.s.s to get the same pay as the slackers.  Also why save money when it is not your savings to plan on medical expenses, college, or retirement?|`|TttP1sENaa	The simple fact is that some people don't or can't work to accomplish what others can.  There are lots of examples of people with all the odds stacked against them who succeeded.  It is senseless to argue that the government needs to take from me and give to the less fortunate in the name of fairness.    Philanthropy is a great thing - preferable to rewarding people for bad decisions (dropping out of school, having children you can't take care of, making bad investments).  I choose my causes and champion them - everyone should do that.    As for scams - why is it up to creating another branch of government to address the problem?  If these people are so vulnerable then their families should be helping them make decisions.    We need to go back about 100 years when people took care of each other.  That's the incentive for education and better decision making.|`|xy7Zjsu1aa	My grandfather died at 93. He worked at GM in the 30's on through the 70's. Th unions came about for many reasons, but to listen to him it had more to do with simple treatment than anything else. According to him supervisors would literally tell a female employee it was "their turn". If they refused they and any family members lost their jobs. Unions are out of control.    Enough about unions.    Tell me where socialism works/has worked please, can you?    It doesn't. Take a look at unemplyment rates of ANY place you think is better...socialist only of course. You can use any of the major European countries you like...Canada...whatever.    During these so called "unprecedented economic times" we are STILL better off.    That is why capitalism works.    I explained this recently to my daughter, because she thought it made sense...    She and two of her friends work at a local dairy farm. She shovels stalls all day, friend 1 washed them down with a hose, and friend 2 uses a fan to dry it.    She makes $10, her friend 1 makes $6, and friend 2 makes $5.    Socialism says take $3 from her and distribute it it to others "less fortunate". So she has $3 taken and distributed so they all have $7. And of course her brother says he can't find work, so they all have to give up $1 so he at least has something.    Now it's of course tough to swallow when she/they work all day and see her brother just hanging out, but he is trying, he just can't find a job he likes. He could work at McDonalds and make $4, but that just isn't enough, so he'll keep looking.    If she is 15 and gets the point why can't you?    We do not see a problem with helping those who really need it... I am NOT republican, I am PROUDLY SICK of ALL of them, but I am sure I am one of those you are talking to.    Distributing wealth does not work. It has been tried all over in many cultures and it fails every time. It has failed here for 75 years. If it worked the problems it seeks to fix would get better. Human nature is a funny thing. People will nearly always choose easy, even if it means they do not do as well.    If you handed someone $5K and said you can keep that or you can bust your butt al day and I'll give you $7K most people walk with the 5.    Back to my point...    SHOW US WHERE IT HAS WORKED

I also understand the whole chant about change, and it is definitely what this country needs. I do believe he can bring change, because these past 8 years under the Bush administration has put this country in the hole.

Out of the 500 promises he has made during the campaign, here is his score card as of day 8    Promises kept 5  Compromise 1  Broken 0  Stalled 1  In the works 17    I am waiting with baited breath.    For now, I like what I see.    Peace  Jim    .    ==================    Assuming he addresses each of those issues, at 22 per week, then all 500 should be in the works by the 23 week of his presidency. Of course that is a pipe dream, some of the issues are going to be very hard to get through, or under our current economic conditions, not wise.    ==================|`|H2h8fnTpaa	Don't focus on his supporters.  He appears to have more sense than to pander to left wing extremists so far.  Give him a chance and ignore his supporters, they will turn on him when they realize he is really not going to support their extremist views.|`|WNh56ZCWaa	He's got everyone in a trance.     His supporters look more and more like cult members every day. Screaming and crying when they touch him, falling to their knees, etc.     If you've ever watched people listening to him speak, their eyes glaze over and seem like they're being hypnotized.      And to be honest all the blind sheep like following is scaring the crap out of me, with all the posters of him that look strangely similar to those of other charismatic dictat - er, world leaders...|`|cWmx0J4jaa	NO, most are not "cult members". They are simply idiots!|`|AA11148986	If you think George Bush is the greatest president ever, and believe that Rush Limbaugh speaks nothing but the truth, you might want to look at the definition of a "cult".|`|JQwL50JMaa	I agree with most of what you say.  They are definitely a cult of personality.  That's why they were called Kool-Aid drinkers during the campaign.  They're brainwashed, and will follow him regardless of what he does to this country.    I wouldn't say 75% of them are that way, though.  It may have been that way during the campaign, but since he was elected, I have seen many Obamabots change their mind.  I would say roughly 45% of the people in the entire population (of partisan sheep) are that goofy now.    His policies are insane and scary.  The people who blindly follow him are just downright disturbed.    Now bear in mind that I am talking about the people who BLINDLY follow him...not regular, everyday Democrats.  I respect that Democrats have different opinions than I, and they can be very reasonable people.  I am talking only about the people who think he can do NO wrong.|`|xfv6526Gaa	Oh there going to get change alright!! I give the democrats 1 year and the better part that voted for osama are going to be extremely unhappy!! He's already got alot of the black ministers ticked off at him as well as alot of die hard liberals that voted for him are already unhappy with him. It's the young people that put him into office you know the ones that don't own homes or pay taxes as well as the welfare people they all think he is going to give them handouts, young and naive is what it is all about...Wait til some of these college kids that voted for him can't get their student loans. A lot of people are going to wake up this year!! Actually Obama took the slogan change from Hitler and look where that got everyone as a matter of fact it was also the young people that voted Hitler in office!!|`|9NVexqv6aa	The borg actually built big cubes and so did something constructive.

dJnRFpWWaa	The GOP is operating under the delusion that their collective stand against the economic stimulus bill will lead to political gains in 2010. Apparently, Rush Limbaugh is the de facto leader of the GOP, and we all know which college awarded him a degree in economics. Don't we?    This is rich. A man who claims to be a guru of the political party that was broken apart because of their uncritical adherence to his political and economic advice continues to give the same advice to a vastly diminished GOP. And they continue to listen to him!!!!! The GOP either isn't smart enough to figure out that Limbaugh is a blithering idiot on all political and economic subjects, or they refuse to concede the point out of a misplaced sense of pride. But in any event they are marching to their own Waterloo at the bayonet point of the village idiots that populate talk radio. It's a sight to behold.    They have no plan, so they will continue to be obstructionist until they lose even more seats in 2010, at which point you might see some change. But even that cannot be assumed.    Take care.|`|KiLGNvLeaa	It will be better than Georgie, he's the one that left us in this mess. He's smiling , because the economy doesn't affect his wallet.

It took 8 years to screw the economy up, yet you have no problems with Bush, but you criticize Obama for not solving it by now? My goodness where do you people come from?

I do think and have so far been proven right, that his election will be a pandora's box of racially charged rhetoric and nonsense though. Everything associated with Obama (from the dress Michelle was wearing at the inauguration to any disagreement about his policies) will become all about race and race baiting.  But I don't think it will suppress white people.|`|r6JskEtxaa	Not at all.|`|A6q6Ravhaa	no  nothing is  going to make them want to do any more than they have to|`|vHpI0M41aa	Well, they do if they were mentored by Wright, as obama was...think about that one!    It doesn't look like this election will make any positive difference in race relations in this country.  That is due, in large part as usual, to the view of the black people who further create the racial divide by constantly bringing it up.|`|AA10460376	OMG!.....Don't you see how this has affected your boyfriend already?....The fact that you can say that "BLACK people will get more of a say is evidence that your "WHITE BOYFRIEND" was aware of the fact that black people was at least "OPPRESSED" in the area of POLITICS and that your "WHITE BOYFRIEND" is concerned with whether he will become second rated to "BLACK PEOPLE" now that Barack Obama is President.....I never really knew the "HIDDEN" racism that is so deeply rooted in some of us and when we try to suppress these feelings of racism it comes out in other areas....AND YES you are correct...Most black people blame whites for the things that happened in past history because the WHITE MAN WAS TO BLAME....If you cann remember the race of people who were "OPPRESSED" and the RACE of people who were IN POWER then maybe this will help you....Being in DENIAL about the hardship that the white man put on others only serves to satisfy you for the moment....BUT GUESS what? It always come back to HAUNT YOU because that is the GOD in your spirit that responds to the GOD in the OPPRESSED and say that maybe I have a responsibility to rectify the WRONG that my ANCESTORS IMPOSED ON OTHERS.....But, to make you feel better, I cannot say that you have been called to such a respnsible duty because you are only doing what you were told to do, but there are many of your race who knows that they have a duty to do something to "RIGHT" the "WRONG" that has been imposed on other races but......

I'm glad the smart people will have more say in politics    I'm glad the idiotic views and opinions will be seen as just that.|`|a5cb58a8106c34d8f182eaa2e2377a36aa	Well, african americans have always thought that white people had it better than them- but white people have had to work for things, and all of the african americans I know get food stamps and dont have to work for them- even though my hubby is disabled and i take care of him, and im pregnant- we have not been able to get any at all because I cant work while taking care of him...yet all of the african americans i know get food stamps and the office never turns them down...so they have it easy as heck. they already get so much handed to them so the country doesnt look racist and so they dont bring up what happened years ago. Personally, I really think this will just make it easier for african americans and a heck of a lot harder for white people.    If a white woman who is taking care of her disabled husband, is pregnant, and living off of less than $900 dollars a month for the both of them(plus a baby when shes born in 2 weeks) cant get any help at all, yet all minorities can get free handouts all the time without having to even lift a finger, than I cant see how things can improve...    Honestly, I could care less about race...but im sure its obvious to everyone who gets more special treatment, and who will get more now that an african american is president- otherwise, his color wouldnt be the main focal point in this whole election and inauguration.|`|C46DNX11aa	The new media is bias. They always go into the ghetto and ask black people why they voted for Obama so that they can point out some of their lack of knowledge on the election. I am proud that they got out and voted. Some for the first time in their lives. I think that maybe whites were to blame for slavery a long time ago but " it's a new day" and while there is still tons of racist. I do not use them as an excuse in today's society as to why some blacks can't prosper.We have a lot of smart, intelligent black men and women. Some just choose to use their intelligence in a negative way.Gotta love em though!|`|NsYPUHOcaa	equal rights in Los Estados Unidos...|`|DK6kYxmGaa	Just to let everyone (who doesn't know already), President Obama is not the first African American President. Fact: He has a Black dad, and a White mom which makes him bi-racial; therefore not a true African American (a person who has black parents, or came from Africa and become a US Citizen).   Based on the logic, Congratulations President Obama for being the first Bi-Racial President of the United States! :)

I would think that most people have heard of it and anyone alive at the time would remember it.|`|Ikd9cppcaa	I have.|`|QskM0Mfsaa	i remember it like it was yesterday|`|dMBSE8ilaa	What? Where those college students were shot because they protested the war in Vietnam? Yeah, I heard about it.|`|repO76qoaa	I heard of it. It is referred to as the Kent State Riots.|`|0eFSeap5aa	After the Murrah building in Oklahoma was bombed by some anti-government fanatics any number of somewhat less violent groups came out of hiding to announce their aversion to the government as well.    I was with a group of rather left-wing folks who got to chattering about how ridiculous these people's claims were and spent a great deal of wind talking up the wonders of the government and all it does.  It should be pointed out that everyone in this group was either unemployed or a government employee.    I casually remarked that the claims of these fringe groups was ridiculous and that if you got them talking they would have you believe that the government shot and killed several college students during a protest.  They all scoffed at that notion, though the one graybeard in the group pauses and says to me "You are talking about Kent State aren't you?"|`|lvBUl3Zdaa	You only want to know "heard of"? I have more than heard of it.|`|AA11739944	It's in history books sooooo...everyone should hear of it.|`|lhH7vynGaa	You mean that terrorist attack on those innocent Americans?

bkav003oaa	Fantastic. Helps hundreds of thousands get quality, affordable health care.|`|92iuiuZKaa	It's a good thing.    Because I heard it's a really good insurance. It covers alot|`|q4EXFhV7aa	Great. 9 million of our elderly, most of our Veterans, all of our permenantly disabled, out of work citizens, and all of our foster children (3 million) desperately need Medicaid.|`|AA10168935	Good.  You shouldn't die from lack of help if you can't afford the care.|`|82e3eb215485ac8bca5c7c3854ee30ecaa	Good if you need it because you're out of work/underemployed.  My son was in intensive care when he was born, and now he's healthy.  I could have never paid that bill.   HOWEVER, living on social services is NOT a career choice!  You have to keep going.|`|AA11942937	It has it's good use and bad abuses.  Just like all gov't programs that are not strictly supervised.    I know some who are more than deserving of the help.  The would be dependent on some kind of family support (which may not be there for them) without it.    I know some who are on medicaid and should not be.  they are just too lazy to work.  They could if they had any gumption to them, but it has been suppressed by the free check they get.  Why work when they beat the system and got on medicaid...now it's free ride time. (I happen to know one that fits in this category very well.)|`|102c9ffa3c2464456b10393b0da76065aa	Bad. It is abused by drug addicts who run to the ER every day for no reason than for drugs that we pay for or for attention.|`|AA10466438	They should get rid of it and replace it with something that works.|`|3GXYel3Kaa	Do you mean Medicaid or Medicare?    I can't really speak to either, since I neither use them nor am I completely familiar with their requirements. But I will say that in a very recent discussion with my doctor, he was a big fan of Medicare and hoped that it would be the basis for extending health care to all if there is a national healthcare system put into place.    Why? Surprisingly (for I thought the system fraught with corruption) the system works well for doctors and they lose considerably less money and are able to provide better healthcare to their patients than with those on PPO's/HMO's.      True, Medicare is focused more on the over 65 population and it is funded strictly through federal funds, whereas Medicaid functions to serve all those in low income categories and is jointly funded with states. Medicare is thus more limited, but it does a much better job of coverage.    I would say that if a doctor who has worked in several countries for forty years has a good sense of what works well, he might well be worth listening to.    Cheers.
aVEVchFxaa	You seem like a very thoughful person. : ) First of all, do your homework. There should be someone at the prison who is the head of pen pal management. Contact that person first to get some information or background on the prisoners housed in their facility. And sad as it may sound, but you can't just communicate with just any prisoner all willy nilly. Some like you have said or beyond help and quite sick. Also look online for pen pal do's and dont's. I think there's a website out there for that. And last but not least, wishing you good luck with that. Could use more like you out here in this cruel world that we live in.
lvBUl3Zdaa	Holding feet to the fire, why don't they just heat my house for me?|`|TsjqzanQaa	Government spending is always frightening.    Many in our government are corrupt, and want to find ways to channel the money to cronies, special interests, family and friends.    Government waste is monumental, and once they get their hands on the money, they waste it as quickly as they can, and then clamor for more, more, always more.    Each little government department is like a little kingdom, and they use up their budgets as thoroughly and quickly as possible, so that it won't be known that they can actually do things more efficiently and effectively on a much smaller amount of money.    Bailing out the banks is ridiculous.      Now they're living high on the hog, with bonuses, expensive junkets and more!    They'll never learn.|`|Ikd9cppcaa	The Democrats will keep up with the paybacks, pork and earmarks until they have totally devalued the dollar and we are forced to go to some kind of World Currency.

The only reason why they didn't ask for all of that money up front is because it would completely outrage the American people (as if it hasn't already).  They will spend that much to try and fix it, mark my words, expect another 1 or 2 more $700 billion bailouts over the next 4 years.|`|SS1VReF0aa	The first 750+ wasn't needed...they are just delaying the inevitable. They can keep throwing good money at the problem and watch it burn in the fire...or they can just let things take their course and the fire will die on it's own.|`|RPeqzomsaa	"Government is not the solution to our problem, government IS the problem." -Ronald Reagan at his first inaugural speech, 1981.|`|18167e6cb8bb213b37ad670e7870b7fdaa	I'm not real happy about it, but it's going to happen.

Our Economy generates about 14 Trillion in GDP each year. The bailout for banks was 700 Billion. That is 5% of GDP or nothing. There are 3 Trillion in Sub Prime loans made from 2004-2008. Sure the banks need more, at least 2 Trillion just for sub prime and another 2Trillion for A,B,C+ paper.    Yes they will be back and back and back and back until the lemon heads in DC understand how big the problem they created is.     The Banks should fail, Stock/bond holders lose their bets, the Trillions used to start new "clean" balance sheet banks so they can lend without worrying about going broke tomorrow.|`|ghHpGlVDaa	It will be interesting to see where the money comes from and who America is beholden for the loan of this money.

91f4faf8ec7a7bfd7cbf79b84af56d5eaa	Actually you are incorrect. China's currency has been rising against the dollar. This makes Chinese products more expensive to import to the US. They are losing alot of their manufacturing to countries with lower costs like India.    I have been to China many times myself as an exporter and the Chinese are in big trouble. In fact, there was recent article about a mass exodus from one of their major exporting cities, Guangzhou because many of the factories were going out of business because they were losing US customers. People have started moving back to the farmlands because there is no longer any opportunties.    China is in trouble...|`|ZOXoPgJbaa	This is a good thing for us. Considering we buy everything from China, this would shrink the trade deficit, and leave more money to be circulated in America's economy.    Oh and we are manipulating our currency much more than they are ....|`|SS1VReF0aa	China's economy relies on us as much as we rely on them.|`|UHHioi1Xaa	Republicans care about one thing, lining their pockets.

213f666773cffd74c8011aef2ba50f81aa	You'd have to be making less than minimum wage not to pay any Federal Income Taxes and absolutely nothing at all not to pay any mandatory federal taxes on income, such as Social Security and Medicare.    If a part-time worker, let's say a senior citizen or discouraged full-time employment seeker, makes less than $13,000/ year (still too much to completely eliminate an individual's federal income tax burden) but pays >$500 in social security/medicare I do not see a problem in refunding their payroll taxes in full.    By the way, to all you people screaming "socialism:" Ronald Reagan --taking an idea from Nobel Prize winning, free-market conservative economist Milton Friedman-- implemented the Earned Income Credit (tax rebates for low income workers still in existence today) as part of his "workfare" idea to replace welfare.  Were Reagan and Friedman "Socialists?"|`|Ikd9cppcaa	Because we have entered into Socialism. This is when you work hard and your money is stolen and given to the bums and illegals that don't like to work. It's not fair that you have more money than you need and you need to learn to share.

Get back to us with the response you get from Hamas, something tells me it won't be positive.|`|ZOXoPgJbaa	concerned is an understatement. Im terrified.|`|SS1VReF0aa	I'm worried about our government for one reason...there was a time when our government lead the way. We said, this is how it should be done and we are going to do it our way...recently I have been hearing all this bs about "they do it this way in Europe" "the world hates us" etc.  The world can f' off in my opinion. The world profited from our prosperity, but as soon as we come upon hardship they blame us for their shortfalls...Countries around the globe complain about how we handle foreign affairs, but do you notice that we are the only ones handling these affairs? What would happen to the rest of the world if the US just said, "forget it, we are done?"    All governments have corruption, they all make mistakes...but at one time we weren't afraid to do things our way. Doing it our way is what made this country great, so why all of a sudden are we thinking we should change that?|`|LROaxvV8aa	Yes.Ever since the LBJ years.

Take a look back into history. If you all take a look at the things that went on you could see that our government is falling apart.  First, you can see that the government is changing. Some for the good, some for the bad. But what I want to point out is that if we are not careful and take a stand as a nation, all our rights will be taken from us. The thing that makes me scared is that we as a nation are just allowing the government to take our freedoms away. We need to make a stand to keep our freedom. If we do not stand up for ourselves then later down the road we will have no right to say anything because we could have prevented the government taking compete Control of our freedom. To if you look at what the bible says the world is going to have one currency  and end up with one government that first we will love then we will hate, we are heading that way anyway. One currency, do you not understand that the world is almost there with that one. Think what does almost everyone have in their wallets. PLASTIC. If you want to keep your freedom and don't want to go under on rule then make a stand and let them know how we feel about them taking our rights slowly and us not doing anything to stop it
6iI4xhFbaa	The first issue is that the United States must ensure she meets requirements for a visa, including that she is eligible.  This includes background investigation, medical screening for specific contagious illnesses, etc.  Second, USCIS (Immigration) wants to be reasonably satisfied that the marriage is not a sham marriage.  This factor will be looked at closer two years after the date of marriage, but it is a legitimate concern for USCIS since we have lots of people wanting to come here and will commit fraud to get here.  Third, USCIS is inefficient in conjunction with having a whole lot of applications and only so much resources to process all of them.|`|qzZAIijJaa	You have to take into consideration that marriage frauds has happened quite a lot in the past in order to gain citizenship. That's why immigration has become more difficult and scrutinizing of every applicant especially from third world countries which is sad because not everyone is dishonest. I'm from a third world country married to a Canadian. It took 6 months (from the date of my interview) for the embassy to give me my visa.    Even if you have submitted the necessary papers, immigration still does their own investigation to make sure the marriage is not a fraud.|`|kNscpF4Faa	I am not knocking you but you do know that MOST foreign women are TAUGHT to go for guys like you on purpose so she is taking care of and gets green card.  think about it..They even tell smokers to say they are non-smokers to potential men.

ab11c77db248f05b2e7090761918cc61aa	Well...for the past 8 years or so it's likely because the Bush's are very good friends with both the royal Saudi family and the Bin Laden family.

You make an appointment to see the principal and discuss it with him or her. Why would you immediately think of lawyers?|`|z88IMXNFaa	Yes, the teacher was insensitive and you might want to speak to the principal about this.  However, consider the possibility that your son smells bad.  Take him to a doctor and have him checked out.  It could be the sign of a medical problem.  In any event, he needs the problem resolved before his classmates start ragging him about it.  Kids can be extremely cruel.  It's your responsibility as a parent to give them less to be cruel about.    Oh, and you do not have a lawsuit - not even close.    Send the kid to class.

JDltTREfaa	Why don't you put a block on your phone to prevent receiving blocked calls?  Every phone company has different names for the phone blocking services available. Explain to the phone company what you need, and they should be able to give you all the available options.    Chances are pretty good that the police would give you this same advice because they just don't have time to investigate every dumb kid who makes crank phone calls.  It's a nuisance.  It's annoying.  And it IS criminal behavior.  But it's not going to be anything of a priority to your over-worked under-manned local police department.    In the alternative, what I would recommend is that you answer the phone the next time you get this type of call and say the following in a very clear and calm voice:  "Please remain on the line.  The police are tracing this call because I have informed them that I want to prosecute you for telephone harassment."    95% of the time the crank caller will have a total OSM, will slam the phone done, will NEVER call you again, and probably won't make any crank calls to anyone else for at least a week.|`|56c3916305365c5f7b6879c899c6e5efaa	umm that happened to me, verizon didn't care,they told to call the police, and they have better stuff to do, they won't care|`|rbKJF1FLaa	artemis d: cell phone companies do not have an option to block restricted phone calls. you can only block them on landlines

So are you telling me that they where anti -american?|`|3FtC9D40aa	Liberals are now a shadow of their former selves. They now drink their own kool-aid.|`|9qJPfpRpaa	The number one priority for any real liberal is to advocate complete and total individual freedom. Look it up in that dictionary you seem to be so fond of. This is why you don't see true liberals proposing laws to limit free speech, or ban people from marrying who they like.    Furthermore, just because a person is a Democrat doesn't mean they are a liberal. The world is not that black and white, though you would like to think it is. SImilarly, most Republicans are not conservative.     But hey, I just spoke truth, so I fully expect to have dozens of thumbs down.|`|sO9SpUo4aa	Liberal does not stand for liberty. The liberty in liberal is that government is liberal in its handout if you become dependent on government. Then you will vote for a liberal and the USA will become more socialist. Therefore more government therefore more liberal.|`|LZw4JntHaa	Bravo. You have summed it up well. Today's "liberals" are the antithesis of true liberals (Jefferson, Madison, et. al.), who promoted liberty. Today's liberals want to control and restrict more and more of our lives in order to promote their notion of "equality". The result of their goals can only be disaster.|`|O1Unx5RUaa	Who the **** needs liberty?  We need a Communist revolution.  The Government should take care of us and we should all be loyal to King Hussein.    They say "give me liberty or give me death".  We'll give them death alright.|`|9jDBKKw7aa	Bingo!|`|NQYKzv7faa	Give me liberty, or give me death!    Dont take my freedom by making me pay for things i dont believe in.|`|ycNxVrUfaa	Within WHOSE party? Do you realize there isn't a "Liberal" party?  You're pretty damn unAmerican if you won't even give our new president a chance. America is great and I'm grateful to be an American. I'm glad I got to vote for the person I thought would help with the horrific conditions we're dealing with. I voted Obama.
AA11450062	Well I don`t know about police and fire cuts. The point is that we would not have to make cuts if Republicans did not give our industrial might to China and the debt from the Republican Iraq war. That is why they are cutting.|`|q4EXFhV7aa	Source for the 'worthless programs that ONLY help lazy people..."??     The postal service is requesting that they go from 6 to 5 days, not liberals. Further, the postal service isn't making money largely due to the internet, again, not liberals.|`|Ikd9cppcaa	Because then the voter is much more likely to go along with their stimulus package if they think the essential services will be cut off otherwise.|`|70DZWz2Baa	Because they need more money to spend to do nothing. and my aunt is one of them(can't stand that fact).|`|ayhDyb16aa	Liberals and Democrats never earn a single vote they simply buy votes using other peoples money. ----------------------5.2 billion to ACorn, 400 million to AL Gore, 335 million for condoms|`|I6dcRgD6aa	I don't need to get mail everyday but I wish they would cut it on Wednesday rather than Saturday but I guess businesses prefer Saturday which is understandable.  When I see people say that people are lazy I know that you don't know anyone who is collecting assistance or you would know how rude this is to the veterans or handicapped, etc. I would rather have no mail service than for someone to die from not affording heat which just happened to a 93 year old man. That is why, compassion, decency. True Christianity not the fake stuff.|`|3yXhtBSxaa	Cutting the mail down to five days a week instead of cutting out useless pork programs is ridiculous.  How in the hell is THAT going to stimulate the economy?  First the USPS will cut down mail delivery, and then they will start going after people's jobs.  Mark my words.    Actually, now that I think about it, didn't they start eliminating jobs within the USPS across the country a few months ago?  Someone feel free to correct me if I am wrong, but I vaguely recall some cut backs being made.    The world has truly gone mad.|`|3FtC9D40aa	Lol because that is their voting block.    Most people who earn a paycheck every week knows quite well that all those free handouts aren't exactly free.|`|3DOQG6hEaa	Source for your idea that they support cutting police and fire rescue (as these are state services, and the Federal government does not fund them) since your premise is false, this question is pointless.|`|AA10253095	Because the Democrats pretend to care but they are so full of lawyers that love to defend killers, rapists, molesters as well as trying to force the American public to love Abortion and gay marriage.|`|RtHq6y78aa	Because they want to have promiscuous sex so they NEED $350 million for STD prevention!|`|XoAwzQ5Yaa	For the person somewhere above me (neocons can't think): Police and fire services are paid by the state, which gets a large chunk of its' funding from the federal government. Most states are getting 20-30% less funding, and an expected additional 20-30% decrease come next fiscal year (July). So, yes, police and fire services are being cut due to federal funding. I work in law enforcement, and we're already laying off people, so are the local fire departments.|`|FIXKYCIGaa	You obviously don't know how the budgeting for the USPS works or how it differs from other government agencies and I'm not in the mood to educate you.  Consider this a homework assignment.|`|JLayHNZCaa	Your important services are another's pork spending.  You just don't get it do you?  On the one hand, people claim everyone needs to pay their own way, yet if it affects something they hold dear, it is liberals wanting to cut important services.   If we are going to turn our country around, some things we have accepted as untouchable, will have to be cut somewhat.  You can't have it both ways.|`|7KJcMpl9aa	Here in Canada we don't get mail on weekends, and it seems to work out fine for everyone.    Deal online if you're in such a hurry to get things done.    (BTW, welfare is a good idea for some people.)|`|Z7W6FRoSaa	What other programs, exactly, do you mean? Obama is going to bailout the banks at our expense, just as Bush has done.|`|587533eca4604b2d23fa382dc6204d59aa	Because that's more scary so people will think tax increases are badly needed.  In every Democrat-run city, county & state and when they have Congress, EVERY year at budget time they ALWAYS tell us we need to pay higher taxes or lose BASIC services. Your city cops will have to be cut if you don't open your wallet, but you can bet your *** the Labor Day parade won't be scaled back, nor will ANY entitlement/welfare program be.

Underprivileged youth? Ivy league schools (with shockingly enough Pakistani roommates) and coke wasn't cheap - don't snipe at me - read his books - did a lot of blow smoked a lot of pot - class act. Then traveling to countries where Americans weren't even allowed. . .hhmmmnnn then on to become a "community activist" (read Chicago hood) to the law firm where he worked briefly with  his family friend Ayers wife (but he didn't know them) to a state senator who barely showed for votes without a liberal agenda on to congress for a couple of months to running for our highest office to the grand coronation - it's good to have the right friends I guess.|`|KiLGNvLeaa	yes he's slightly well off. as for his commitment only rich people have the commitment to be President of The United States Of America.

This isnt about looks on peoples faces.  It is about what is good for america.   Youre way off here.|`|AA11598520	First, only fools care what the world thinks of us and our President. The rest of us care what he's doing for us since we employ him. Second, it wasn't a "vast" majority of America, considering he only got 53% of the vote. Hardly a mandate. I'm not surprised, though, that you don't know this since you are more in love with the idea of his being the messiah than his work as a President. Indeed, it IS priceless! Further, it truly is sad that those two things are counted as "the best moments of [your] life." If that is true, you need to get one.    Oh, and one last thing....Obama's nomination and his winning the presidency DIDN'T happen on the same night, but, rather, months apart.|`|t4YoOX1paa	If that was one of the best moments of your life you must not have a very full life  .

Here is a link you might find helpful for your state's laws:    http://www.handgunlaw.us/|`|dda37e592e7a473ae883df834ad9805faa	Well you didn't say what state you live in and therefore it's not possible to accurately answer you question.  In states like the one I live in there is no registration requirement at all, the government here still has some trust in the people.    Check out this website for a summary of gun laws in all states and links to each state's official site for full details.    http://www.handgunlaw.us/|`|P4vRH5Ufaa	Local Laws vary greatly.  In my home state of Indiana if you are 18 you can get a carry permit or a target permit for handguns at your local sheriffs dpt. (provided you can legally own a firearm.)  Indiana does not require registration of handguns.  Furthermore, if you do not intend to leave your home Indiana does not require you to have any form of permit.  Depending on where you live you should simply call your state and municipal law enforcement agencies and inquire.|`|vzGPL7lhaa	Each state has its own laws about gun ownership. Some states are much more rigid than others. Indeed many states do not require a permit at all. Therefore it is impossible to offer a general set of rules that apply everywhere. The only common denominator is that a federal background check is required in all jurisdictions before a gun can be sold.|`|Xn0Lh8T3aa	Go to this link and click on your state:    http://www.nraila.org/gunlaws/|`|yLQ2rUHnaa	if your state isnt california, take the pistol to the local sheriff or state police office have them run the serial, if it is good, take a concealed carry course(most pawn and gun stores have the info on where,who,how much), pay the state fee and sit on your *** and what for the paperwork.|`|arXHFPcTaa	In the state of Tennessee, as with most other U.S. states, there is no registration.  Assuming your father-in-law lives in Tennessee, if he gave it to you, you legally own it, and nothing else is required.  If you want to carry it anywhere other than your private property, Tennessee requires a handgun carry permit.  You have to take an 8 hour class from an authorized instructor, then you apply to the Department of Safety, and a month or two later, you receive your permit.  Once you receive the permit, you can carry any handgun you legally own or posses.    There are authorized training schools all over Tennessee.  If you're interested in that, try the following link, try a google search for Tennessee handgun training, or feel free to contact me directly if you would like.  I'm a TN handgun training instructor and I would be glad to recommend someone in your area if you tell me what general area you are in.  If you contact me, I won't ask you for any personal information, other than just your general area of the state.    http://www.state.tn.us/safety/handgunmai...    http://www.rrmemphis.com  - my personal website
gwHmR2LWaa	Dude,    Yes, BUT, If this is your very first traffic violation (traffic violations such as this is an infractions), and if traffic school is available to you, consider doing it.  Here's why:    1) If you complete traffic school, and report back to court with       proof that you successfully completed it, it will not go against      your record; and your insurance will not go up.    2)  You can plead "No contest" (its the same as a "Guilty" plea)       However, it'll be a mark against your drivers license privileges       This will mean your auto insurance may most likely go up.       Avoid it if you can.    So, consider  1 before  2.    Now, as you stand before the judge, ask him if traffic school is available for you.  If it is, considering doing it.    Hope this helps.|`|7HoI6diYaa	Sure... but it won't help you win your case.  Kind of stupid if your trying to prove the police wrong...|`|9e9bmwJ2aa	pleading no contest is the same as a guilty plea the only difference is that a no contest plea can not be used against you in a civil suit. so in your case it wont help you.if you had gotten in an accident and someone was hurt you would want to plead no contest so that it could not be used as a guilty plea if they sued you. hope this helps and good luck|`|349430e91043395f31bd69026affa76eaa	1) If you did in fact commit the offense ( you obviously have at least one police officer as an eye witness against you) Confess, pay your fine and move on.      2) More likely than not you would have been found guilty anyway.|`|T6nmD3X9aa	sure you can, it is just like pleading guilty (but only because you have to, cant prove you didnt do it & too much evidence against you)    If your lucky, maybe the cop wont even show up to court and you will be free~    good luck!

sO9SpUo4aa	Lets see.  In no major conflict let alone War has any opposing force surrendered to any General except for an Army General!  Navy is the transporters of the Army. By the way, the Army has a larger fleet of ships since they cannot trust them.  Marines Bad *****s but still part of the department of the navy. Their job is to go from hostile waters to land in a hostile shore. Make the beach safe for the Army to land and win the war.  The Coast Guard enough said.  The same with the Air force, A transportation asset for the Army.  The Army has more Aircraft and pilots than the Air force by the way  Now that you see that the Army is the best ask which is better of the elite force   Army Rangers, Special Forces Airborne or Air Assault|`|AA10025824	Don't worry about boot camp.  And if you're confused and disoriented right now you should join the Marines.  (just kidding).    Look at what kind of job you'd want to do and what would interest you.  I went in the Navy and spent several years on a Submarine and thought it was a great experience and I'm glad I did it.  There's a world of opportunity and you have the chance right now to pick what would be best for you.  Their websites will show you a lot.|`|hexzaIGgaa	You also need to learn how to compose an English sentence. Can I ask what college signed you up?|`|Ejp10ZEtaa	Marines. Semper Fi dude!|`|bfxerFkeaa	the army.  they give better sign up bonuses and more chances for promotion.|`|DKfScL8taa	I'd say any one you want to except the Air Force! If You're pretty fit, you can go on to be a navy seal, an army ranger, special forces, but I don't think air force has an special forces. I am an army vet, and would totally recommend the Army. They have a WAY better budget. You'll get paid the same in all branches, but your equipment will be better in the army. Allthough I have heard that the airforce  has really nice facilities, so just talk to all four recruiters, and make a good decision!|`|fZCfJWpOaa	My husband is in the Army.  He wasn't sure which branch to choose either, so he looked at the benefits each provided.    His reasons for choosing the Army was because you were promoted through the ranks faster, had better pay and bonuses, and good benefits for the spouses and children (dependents).  I think his second choice was the Air Force but shhhhhh.... I didn't say that. ^.^    As for boot camp, everyone is scared when going into it, but don't worry.  Just remember that everyone in the military has been where you are there.      Start working on running 2 miles without stopping to prepare.  The army's quarterly physical training test has you doing that, timed.  I think Marines have to run 3 miles for their test.  You can look at the physical training scales online, I'm sure.  There's running, push ups and sit ups.  My husband trained before he went to basic, and he said it made his stay there MUCH easier because he was already closer to the ideal physical shape.    Good luck whatever you choose!|`|s3AwAF4saa	marines|`|tezszivdaa	depends on what your interested in.    if you are more into engineering, you should get into the air force or navy. they need some good engineers in there. this country needs more and more engineers....it is starving.    if you want the front lines, marines and army is the answer for you.|`|kKdUhS2gaa	IM an marine corps vet go to school the service sucks|`|IfNjgcxGaa	to chose a branch think deeply about what you want to do during and after the military, flight/computer tech are both best in the USN/USAF, US Army can give you good general fields and the USMC along with all SpecOps detachments can give you a good background for field agents in law enforcement.  the next thing you need to do is look at yourself and try to get into better shape if your not already in the "best" of shape, for the military in general you should try to go for 40+ push ups, 60+ crunches in 2 minutes and try to run 1+ miles straight, this will help you greatly in Boot Camp/Basic Training|`|3WM04Urraa	well my questin was simular but yeah u should go by ur best interst  like personaly i wouldnt choose navy or army id pick marines cause there way bad *** plus my friends in the marines right now and he loves it  but yeah he hasnt went 2 iraq yet thou cause he just stationed in japan 4 now///|`|yLQ2rUHnaa	well, hero, check it out!!!    board games,paintball,HALO3 marathons,etc....should in no way,shape,or form influence any choice you make as far as gauging yourself as a soldier,sailor,or marine. running a couple of laps is nothing compared to averaging 4 miles, 3 times a week in basic training. "smarts", gets you through the ASVAB/AFCT, not basic training. intestinal fortitude, and a resilient attitude is what counts. i love a soldier who can is smart, but algebra 2 and physics have nothing to do with remebering a 9-line MEDEVAC request or knowing your battlesight zero, and why that is important. i recommend telling ROTC to kiss your ***(nothing against college)and joining as a 11B(infantry) do that for awhile and then drop a green to gold packet. soldiers like officers who are seasoned and i(an NCO with 20 total months of combat experience)have a paticular hard on for an officer who can relate to a soldier. think real long and hard about the military. it is a sacrifice that many have experienced but few can truly stomach.  HOOAH|`|KT0fPjvPaa	The best thing you could do right now is to explore all your options.  Speak with each recruiter and ask them what their branch of service has to offer you.  Each branch of service has a lot to offer, in the end it's just a matter of preference.      As for the Air Force not having any Special Forces, they most certainly do. Do some research.|`|2u4otQ8Gaa	I think you should joing the marine corps. Maybe going into something like communications, it'd b physical, but also you would have to be somewhat in shape.

hmA8nfA2aa	Yes, you have to attend the police academy. The Borough of State College Police Department starts their officers out at $41,163.32.    In Pennsylvania, the police academy (Act 120 Training) consists of over 700 hours of instruction / training. There are several municipal police academies in Pennsylvania. They are operated by colleges or universities or large police departments. If you qualify, you can enroll in the training. The tuition is usually approximately $4,000. Some police departments will hire you, and then send you to the academy. They would pay for you to attend the academy, and pay you while you were in the academy. You should consider becoming a Pennsylvania State Police Trooper. Check out the websites of some larger police departments in the state and visit the Pennsylvania State Police website. There are many things that you can do to increase your chances of becoming a police officer. Check out http://www.peaceofficerjobs.com for excellent information and advice about becoming a police officer.    Below is the website of one of the police academies that you could apply for an attend at your own expense.  http://www.dccc.edu/teched/police/    There are law enforcement officer jobs in Pennsylvania other than state or local police officer positions that might interest you. For example, waterways conservation officer, wildlife conservation officer, constable, or deputy sheriff. You could also become a police officer employed by the federal government working in Pennsylvania such as a Department of Veterans Affairs Police Officer.|`|8567eea50ee05006e45298c8a269c261aa	Yes, you have to go to an academy to be any kind of police officer.    It's a local position, so you work for one specific city or county, and you are "stationed" there.    In my area of Missouri, we start between $30,00 and $40,000 per year.  It'll be higher in PA because of the cost of living.|`|uZdgOHkPaa	Some departmants on require high school diploma or ged. Yes, you will still have to go to a academy and im not exactly sure on the salary. It really all depends. Im currently trying to do the same.|`|WZK2tKJ8aa	You can usually find what pay is on their website but yes you do the academy and they station you at the district you apply in. If you wanna be a cop in your town, then apply there and if you're lucky enough to make it in, that's where you're stationed...

Supporters of the Army Field Manual approach say information obtained through more benign methods of questioning yield more reliable information. Gen.

"Certainly extreme physical action can make someone 'talk;' however, what the individual says may be of questionable value," he wrote|`|AbtCfY1caa	water-boarding has the attention of the media and they have instructed the people it is bad.  so it is.  the media then tells the people that  only terrorist are killed and that any collateral damage is minor and was necessary.  so it is.  the government controls the media therefore con trolls the people.  how do you know when the west has taken over?  they sell dvds there.|`|90KCAgoAaa	You are not looking for any real answer, but instead more people to back your own opinion.|`|ybLErb9caa	Hold on.You're saying that it's not okay to kill and maim terrorists?

If it is okay and acceptable,then it would legal.Why do we have all these rules if all we're going to do is throw them out of the window when there is an obstacle? That shows that terrorists won because that's what they want people to do.They want people to stop following moral and values and become panicked.They want people to feel terrorized and do irrational things. Don't you see that?|`|nWgTur4qaa	Your great leader "the fake anti-abortionist" Bush didn't do nothing for this country.

But, it has to do with some pesky little things called human rights and ethics. And there's very little evidence to support torture as a way to gain accurate information. For some reason people seem to say just about anything their torturer wants to hear, just to make the pain stop...|`|q4EXFhV7aa	We are in a war, dear. When we are in battle, it is acceptable to kill the enemy. When we capture the enemy (or when the supposed enemy is sold to us in this case) we don't kill them. That is our policy in war time. I would like you to present your evidence that we have received 'a lot of valuable information' through waterboarding. EVERY single interrigator who has said anything about waterboarding has said that it has produced no information---outside of lies to stop the treatment. Finally, we have detainees in GITMO. While some are legitimate terrorists, the vast majority haven't been charged with any crime and haven't been given a trial. We have federal, military, and international laws that prohibit us from both torturing these detainees as well as holding them against their will for 7 years without charging them with a crime.

1219d6000cca01c9f3c4489d1c7b4a16aa	This is not going to be anything like what Bush did.  I wish the media and the politicians would not use the word stimulus, because everyone seems to think a stimulus means the government sends us checks.  That was Bush's idea of a stimulus, and it's been pretty much unanimously agreed that it was not effective.    As it stands, it cuts taxes for the lower / middle classes and allocates a lot of money for spending on alternative energy and construction projects, and a lot of it is pork barrel waste on politician's pet projects.|`|AA11438175	Basically what President Obama's Stimulus package is:    President Obamas Stimulus passed in the House this evening with 244 (in favor) to 188 (against) which means that $825 billion dollars      The White House-backed legislation includes an estimated $544 billion in federal spending and $275 billion in tax cuts for individuals and businesses. The totals remained in flux nearly until the final vote, due to official re-estimates and a last-minute addition of $3 billion for mass transit.  Included is money for traditional job-creating programs such as highway construction and mass transit projects. But the measure tickets far more for unemployment benefits, health care and food stamp increases designed to aid victims of the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression of the 1930s.  Tens of billions of additional dollars would go to the states, which confront the prospect of deep budget cuts of their own. That money marks an attempt to ease the recession's impact on schools and law enforcement. With funding for housing weatherization and other provisions, the bill also makes a down payment on Obama's campaign promise of creating jobs that can reduce the nation's dependence on foreign oil.  The centerpiece tax cut calls for a $500 break for single workers and $1,000 for couples, including those who don't earn enough to owe federal income taxes.    WASHINGTON -A Senate committee has voted to extend a big tax cut for middle-income and wealthy taxpayers as part of the massive economic recovery bill working its way through Congress.  The Senate Finance Committee on Tuesday accepted a bipartisan proposal to shield more than 20 million taxpayers from paying the alternative minimum tax for 2009. The proposal, which would cost about $70 billion, would inflate the Senate's overall economic recovery package to nearly $900 billion.  Extending the tax cut is an annual ritual in Congress, but lawmakers usually wait until the fall to do it, as they did last year. Without the extension, families with incomes as low as $45,000 would be hit with a significant tax increase for 2009.    I hope that this helps a bit, but I also won't believe any such help until I see some change, since we are in such a horrible economic crisis as a country it will take so much to even begin to see a centimeter of a difference in our standing as a whole and our countries' economic growth was not destroyed over night, it took a whole lot of not so bright politicians approximately 8 years to destroy our country so badly and it is equally going to take us some reasonable time to get us back to where we once were before that office term began and where this one is now. I noticed that we were doing pretty good before Bush senior came into office and then it took President Clinton awhile to get us back on track, then it was destroyed even worse by his defiant child... Bush Jr. and it will equally take a "NON-Bush" a good amount of time to help us recover. We haven't ever really been in this kind of predicament,,,, not even in the Depression, if you compare the 2. We have companies that have been around 40+ years and they had to close their doors because no one has money to spend. We aren't even really able these days to afford the simple necessities, let alone go out and buy something that we would like to buy. I don't know about all of you out there, but for me..... I can definately say, that; if I can't afford to buy diapers for my 6 month old and food and pay my rent and bills,,,, there is no way that I am going to be able to go shopping and buy things I we can't eat or use just to save companies that I used to regular or I liked to shop at before, and it is a great shame that great companies are going under and after all this is done, I believe we as a country will wish for those companies to come back and hopefully by then, we won't be left with only 1 grocery store to choose from, 1 gas station, 1 doctors' office and doctor to choose from, 1 hospital, 1 restaurant (if any are able to survive this), 1 pharmacy; etc. I think you get the point, huh? I keep my ears and eyes open and my fingers crossed that we will get out of this safely and get back to at least some "normallsy" as soon as possible.

OAEuYZkZaa	First of all, I detest Obama, but the man has been elected president and thus deserves at least a modicum of respect.    If the man had made a rude gesture, it would have been quite acceptable for him to have been disciplined.    IMO, it makes no difference if it is an Inaugural Parade, a Thanksgiving Parade, an Easter Parade, a Christmas Parade, or any other type of parade.  If the President of the United States give a wave to an American Citizen, it would have been rude to ignore it.  Perhaps he should have given a salute, but a nod is as inconspicuous as a gesture can get.  I do not understand why anyone would get their knickers in a twist about it.    Jokes aside, a Presidential "Pardon," or at least a Presidential Request for Clemency is in order.    But you are probably correct, the man would probably have gotten into trouble if he'd ignored Obama's wave.  Damned for what he did, and almost certainly he'd have been damned if he didn't.    Doc|`|cWyQc7T7aa	For one, it's not news.    Another thing...regardless of your feelings for the Commander in Chief, it would be an honor to see and have him acknowledge you in a parade.

You cannot deposit your check into any account unless your name is on it.    Question 2- If your single you most likely will not have the choice to live off base. Privates and specialists are usually required to live on base since command wants to keep an eye on them more. Once you hit sergeant you can get off base easier.    Question 3- You can be an MP anywhere in the World. If in your contract you have a specific branch then thats where you will go, if not its up to the needs of the army.|`|KQL3tqS7aa	You can have your paychecks go to that bank account.  In basic training you will set up where you want them to go.  For housing, since you're single, you will live in bachelor housing (not the family housing).  As far as duty stations....I know in the Navy, at the end of school there were a certain amount of duty stations and the top of the class got first pick amongst them.  You aren't going to have much say...the military puts you where they need you.  At most, you may have a handful of choices come your 2nd rotation.|`|AA10025824	You can have your paychecks direct deposited in any bank you have an account.    As long as you're in the military they will supply a place to live.  If you're single it's almost guaranteed to be on a base unless you request to live off base, in which case you'll get extra pay to do that.    No, there's no particular base you'll be stationed at.  Maybe if you re-enlist down the road you can get stationed where you request but there are bases all over the world and any one that needs you will be where you go.|`|ABmZYbDZaa	You can have your pay go anywhere you want it to, Your name does NOT have to be on the account. But, you will need access to it so you can take care of yourself to. Best bet is to get an account and then set up what is called an allotment to go to your mother every month. She will get whatever amount you want on the 1st of every month like clock work and the rest will go to your account.     When you go to BCT you will be paid but it will be about 6-8 weeks before the first pay is deposited.|`|BRyRtQSvaa	1. Yes  2. if single you WILL be in barracks, until you reach an NCO grade  3. No particular base, you have to think of yourself as a Desk, you go where you are needed!|`|Rn9N7E0uaa	If you're 17, I'd join now and stay in DEP as long as you can.  This will cut down on your IRR time.|`|Ln5XNno3aa	1.Yes you can set your pay up any way you want.  2.You have to live in the Barracks if you are single, if you are a NCO you can live off post if no room is available in the barracks or you are a SSG or above.    3. IF you are a field MP, you mean WHEN, we are all field MP's now besides Special Forces Military Police in the Army are the highest deployed MOS in the Military.|`|367926de3fa96492022d3fae80bbab42aa	1st question. You can get your paycheck sent to any account you want.    2nd question. You most likely will live on base if it's just you. Depending on which base your assigned to will determine what housing arrangements they have. For exampe, at NSA Bahrain, members that are E-1 to E-3 must live on base. E-4 and above must rent flats in town due to limit housing space available. This is the last I knew of anyway.    3rd question. Where you get stationed at will be at the needs of the service you belong to. They may offer you a dream sheet where you can pick 3 places, but ultimately it is up to the military to decide where you go. By the way, what is a field MP?|`|sgEloO1Jaa	i would recomend opening your own account and then sending her money if she really needs it. dont let other people have access to your account it can really create problems.|`|1437d63201b078c3717a84bafb36241baa	1.  Yes, your money can be deposited but if I were you, I would set up my own bank account, and then give her some money if you are going to help support her.    2.  You can live on base.    3.  You can request GA, but there are no guarantees.

That a huge stretch considering Ahmadinejad really has no political power in Iran, the current Khomeini does.  Wrongs have been done on both sides (I suggest you review a little CIA history and Reagan and Iran history) but I seriously doubt if you'll hearing apologies from either side coming any time soon.|`|Sqp6HjtMaa	Damn you are here all the time! Do you ever go to sleep??!|`|gSdeVUOTaa	It isn't over yet.|`|wEOJyEw0aa	Mahmoud is on his way out any ways and did you not read the whole article guess you missed this part The new U.S. administration has said Obama would break from his predecessor by pursuing direct talks with Tehran but has also warned Iran to expect more pressure if it did not meet the U.N. Security Council demand to halt its disputed nuclear work.|`|c41f84986e1b8e191747b9c81200eafdaa	I think if we apologized for the Shah, it would be a start... he was our hand picked leader... after his predecessor nationalized the oil companies in Iran.    But, we can otherwise tell them to go pound sand, IMO.|`|zJTF5p9aaa	Are you afraid of everything? It must be nice living in a world of good vs. evil. Polarizing much?
lh1arj84aa	It does. It trivializes what blacks went through. Gays aren't being forced to drink from separate water fountains. They aren't having dogs sicced on them. They aren't being prevented from voting. It's a completely separate issue.|`|94067f0094ecabf35aa20a2ef3c6e10daa	About as much as it bothers me when African Americans try to compare their plight to Indians, Irish, German, Mexicans or women in general.  Everybody has at some point been discriminated against. One persons pain is not greater than that of the next.|`|OrvTG44laa	No.  It is relatively the same thing, except this time it is about sexual orientation rather than race.  It is also not as extreme.  But other than that, it is about equal rights.  Whether you're gay, straight, white or black, you deserve equal rights.  Being straight does not make you superior to gays.  Why should they be treated like it?  Gays deserve the right to be married, just like anyone else.    It is fair to compare the two.  We once lived in a society where whites were considered to better than blacks.  White people were treated better and had more rights.  Blacks were looked down upon and were not equal to whites.  Now when we look back on that, most of us- excluding racists and bigots, agree that it was a horrible time period and it was completely wrong.  Today, we do not treat gays as equals.  That is not fair, and it is just like what we did in the 1950's.|`|jbR6aTwMaa	DOES IT BOTHER YOU    people are BBB FFING AS YOU SPEAK?    h ah ah ah ahhah a    YES we need pat robertson evagelical BUTT POLICE PATROL    why is the GOP more worried about GAY butt SEX   than the ECONOMIC DISASTER they cause?    ha hah ah ha hah|`|i0GE9SuYaa	I always thought that was funny & if I was black I would tell them to STFU.    Well I guess we know how bankobush rolls...|`|mWmmsHAaaa	that's like the frying pan calling the kettle black|`|bmCInR5qaa	Yes. Gays have been oppressed much longer, regardless of race or gender. And we, of course, never sold our families into slavery for quick cash.|`|VBeFzAV1aa	no, they are very much alike. i am a straight male but i am very much for gay rights. i will give you theyre not completely the same, the rights of blacks were affected much more then gays are today. but the right to be married, to share all the legal benefits, both state and federal ones, is  very much a civil right that should be extended to all human beings. no, not a man to a pig, or a woman to a duck, any human being over 18 to any other human being over 18. that is very much a civil rights struggle.|`|NMaCcyeKaa	No, but then I'm not gay or African American.  I can see some similarities, though.  Gays get pretty much the same treatment from bigots as African Americans.  People actively advocate that gays do not deserve equal treatment just like they did for African Americans.  Perhaps you should be more understanding of the plight of gay people if you expect people to be understanding of the plight of African Americans.  Gays may not be persecuted as much as African Americans have been, but persecuting gays is still just as wrong.|`|q8l339Gyaa	Who cares. Americans are supposed to be all tough and powerful but you cry and whine about the dumbest crap all the time.       Life is not a Drama series.|`|GCl84SPLaa	For a number of years, the gay community has tried to get themselves classified as a minority so that they can get the rights and privileges that real minorities get, like affirmative action and other things. The problem with that is that to be classified as a minority, you have to be a human being that is something that cannot be changed, for example if you are black, you cannot become another race (OK Michael Jackson has tried but...). Gays try to tell us that they are born with a "gay gene" and that they are not able to change to be a heterosexual.    There are two things wrong with that. 1) Science disproved that theory years ago and many gays have converted back to being straight. and 2) If God hates homosexuality so much, why would He allow someone to be born gay?    Yes it bothers me and it is all about the money and benefits.|`|nNmusYZSaa	I think the comparison is apt--in fact, the California Supreme Court used the 1948 decision that struck down laws prohibiting interracial marriage in their decision.      Do you think that Brown vs Board of Ed should have been put to a popular vote?      Either people have equal protection under the law, or they don't. We either all have fundamental rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, or none of us has.   Exceptions are made for those convicted of crimes, but homosexuality is not a crime.  At one time it was a crime for a black person to refuse to give up his or her seat on the bus to a white person--should Alabama have held a binding referendum on that issue, or was the Supreme Court correct to have decided it on Constitutional grounds?|`|OXcDDLBNaa	The struggles are similar, but for them to claim that both suffered to the same degree is a bit of an exaggeration, particularly where W. Males are concerned|`|1ksrcsYzaa	no, they both suck|`|NJtFYQ96aa	Very much so, seeing how African Americans were born African Americans, homosexuals were not born that way, I have a cousin and friend both who are homosexuals who I know suffered similar abuse growing up. Homosexuals try to draw a parallel with the civil rights movement of the 60s, because they know people have deep seated images of African Americans being beaten and sprayed with high pressure fire hoses, Its there way of saying " Us homosexuals are suffering the same thing" which is absolutely ridiculous.  God bless.|`|EzsnkxgVaa	Are blacks the "magic minority" that deserve equality, while they look down their noses at gays, Hispanics, Jews, and Asians.    This strikes me as, not only offensive but highly hypocritical.|`|WjkVSWZRaa	I'm always amused when I see displays of homophobia from the "open minded" party of "tolerance."

It would be wonderful to get my country back.|`|ayhDyb16aa	Yup no more sanctuary cities, strict fines on employers , no tax payer funded subsidies, no health care,  no legal status granted other than the rights of a human being to have a free bus ride and a one way ticket back over the border.|`|xagIY1Quaa	Baby, we wont have to--they'll deport themselves if we just do a couple of things:    1.  Protect and defend our borders through all means necessary.  2.  Fine, punish and if necessary jail all non compliant US employers.  3.  Cut off access to all medical and education.  4.  If they still remain, arrest and jail them.    First Offense:  6 months and then deport.  Second Offense:  5 years and then deport.  Third Offense:  Life time in a fed'l pen.

At least we don't come killing all of you like you guys did when you firs got here.

Wow, that would be highly difficult considering there are a lot. Possible maybe, but not at all probable.

Having the accident, which is obviously your fault, will be enough to disqualify you.|`|PddGC0lYaa	You CAN go without reporting the accident, and pay it out of your pocket, if the other party agrees.    However, it is illegal to not report it, and it's just not safe either for yourself. If you pay it outta your pocket, but then the other person claims you never paid them, or they have injuries from the accident, or anything else, you can be in a world of trouble.    It's better to report it, but it's up to you. Do you trust the guy you hit?

That is why you need to take responsibility when you vote so that you know who actually has answers and who is blowing smoke.      I saw a clip of a woman celebrating an Obama rally who said "Praise for Obama, I won't have to pay my mortgage anymore, I won't have to put gas in my car anymore."  At that, I sat aghast at the idea that a President would have that kind of power over people.      That and yes, people do think he is the messiah.  I saw a picture where someone has a candle lit with a picture of Obama with a cross on his chest and looking very Christ-like.  It was more than a little scary.|`|hO1J8CTOaa	Always thought he was the Antichrist that would come to deceive everyone.|`|LiC73eggaa	Only Republicans call Obama a 'messiah', but i pray for him and pray to him sometimes.  yes we can|`|q4EXFhV7aa	Only Republicans call Obama a 'messiah'.|`|Ikd9cppcaa	So is the continent of Africa and the rest of the Mideast.

The democrats don't care because they are the party of wasteful spending, though they would still like the republicans to shoulder all the blame to save fragile dem. seats 2 years from now.

Republicans would be smart to stay away from this plan because if it does fail, they can hammer that home in 2012.    No one can be totally sure the bailout will work.  Some people believe it will, but economics is a strange thing.  Alan Greenspan thought that by constantly expanding the money supply and lowering interest rates, that he could avoid a recession - and he was a very smart man.  Well, it looks like Greenspan was wrong and we're paying for his mistakes big time.  How do you know the Federal Reserve is right this time?    The one thing I don't get about the bailout is this: Why not just let people keep their own money?  Why not lower income taxes and allow people to hold onto their cash themselves.  Why does the money first have to go to through the Feds?  Oh right... so the Dems can spend it on their pet projects (Planned Parenthood, Acorn, etc.).|`|7juSlKXyaa	You got it sugar|`|YbEJgvHMaa	And that's why we're where we're at.

296b3ddd20aa6b7c48fb40d2c187aedfaa	It is possible that fast food businesses could be operated by workers' councils.    Capitalism is deception about ownership of companies. There are all new companies, stores, restaurants, and banks every 4 years and an average employment duration of 1 year within false economics capitalism, (that is possibly a secret homelessness-without-health insurance death camp). Remaining solvent does not actually exist within false economics capitalism.    Get rich quick schemes in the capitalist business world, (buyouts, IPOs, conglomerates, acquisitions, mergers, and the stock market), do not actually work. Profit existing in the capitalist business world, or millionaires existing within capitalism, is pathological deception committed by the 21 organizations spying on the population with plain clothes agents, (with covert fake names and fake backgrounds).    Actual economics is the persons that are paying the business loans of companies voting at work in order to control the property they are paying for. The employees of companies are also paying the expenses of companies beyond the salary of the employees.    Capitalism is the psychology of imaginary parents, false economics, and the criminal deception of employees that are paying the bills (including the stocks and bonds, or shares) of companies.|`|Gr99OjQuaa	theres actually rudimentary free market systems that are being practiced in small villages. the goverment is watching them to see how they are developing but they are not interfering with it.|`|EhoJ9mgsaa	They're communist, but starting to incorporate capitalist elements.

x9ZbeJutaa	Yes you can complete your undergraduate degree requirements using tuition assistance.      The education center on your installation will help your wife with funding her education (i.e. FAFSA, Pell Grant).|`|3WYcPsm4aa	The $4500 is your annual cap for tuition assistance, not the lifetime cap.  And, truthfully, unless you are taking more than 2 classes a term or going to a high priced uni., you won't hit that cap.  About the only folks that do are working  on their masters.  Hubby is currently finishing up his degree... only cost has been books.  As a result, the degree that cost his brother $50,000, hubby is getting for free! (They ended up at the same uni... brother doing on campus, hubby doing online.)    Plan on that 4 year degree taking you about 8 years to complete.  Taking 1-2 classes a term is going to be about all you can handle if you have a family.    As for your spouse... there is really nothing right now.  You would have to be in a minimum of 6 years and reenlist for an additional 4 to be able to transfer your GI Bill to her.  Her best bet is scholarships and financial aid.      Good luck!
a8nlx2oRaa	Mark3254 is correct.  Contact the First Sergeant or Commander  The military does not tolerate dead beats when they know about them.|`|ABmZYbDZaa	It is doubtful that he is living in the barracks and getting BAH at the with dependent rate at the same time. He MIGHT be getting differential but even that could be pushing it depending on his duty station and how they handle things.|`|RjpPzbBJaa	First, yes he's still collecting BAH. He's seriously playing her and doing it well honestly. Technically they are still married, so him collecting BAH is not against the rules. The BAH will be cancelled/stopped after they are legally divorced. However she is entitled to that money now.  She should contact his command because he has abandoned her, and taken the marital assets/finances away from her which is not allowed.  If she's in a community property state, all the assets and debts (bills) will be split 50/50, if not the court will split them equally between the two of them.  She needs to file. That's the only way she can get her life back. She can also request alimony stating that he's kicked her out, and kept all the money from her...its likely she'll get it. This will help her get back on her feet again.|`|Ln5XNno3aa	Did they live on base or off? Do they have kids? If they were living on base then he won't profit from any BAH as they take the full amount every month, and he wont stop receiving it until a divorce is final. If they have kids then he still has the responsibility to provide for the child. I see this happen allot and most every time someone is going to get hosed, is it fair? No. But it happens.    Sorry hosed is a nice word for screwed.    Your friend needs to contact the chain of command for the Soldier involved it is against regulation in all services for a Soldier to collect BAH and live in the barracks, UNLESS the commander has authorized it, chances are the commander has no idea this is going on with the Soldier mentioned above. Also I just had a Soldier in the same boat as your friend, the husband (military member) was still required to give the spouse the equivalent of his BAH while they were separated, this could be different depending on the situation, but he is at least responsible for providing her with the difference between single BAH, and BAH with dependents.|`|3ebb87ed0f276343bd04001d7c181545aa	Contact his Command.    By regulation, military members MUST provide support to their spouse and dependents.|`|AA10709853	without a court order she can get nothing.  By rights BAH is HIS.  not hers and he is not obligated to pay her anything without a court order.  and with one.. he is only required to pay her the difference between Single BAH and w/Dependent BAH.|`|gDSJpRvTaa	Suggest she find a job...  Seems like he Free meal ticket is gone...  The Bills she can bring up at the Divorce...    Have to ask the question...  Why would he cut her off while he  was still Deployed...  There is more to this than what  is being stated here...    Yes he does have to support you   while you are still married...  How his CO handles that is up to him.|`|gz5O9Tbpaa	Does she live near his base? She could go talk to the chaplain for assistance (not religious assistance, but real help). She couold try JAG, but some of them wont help the dependents, only the soldiers. But he's very wrong in withholding money from her. He could get in serious trouble if she pushes the issue.|`|jLf2Lbbcaa	She can go to JAG. Once they are divorced she will no longer have any entitlements including BAH, especially if they don't have any kids.|`|iAtXghjOaa	I am going through very similar situation.  I called his Commanding Officer and by military law as long as they are still married she is entitled to 60% of BAH.  Just tell her to call and bug and she will get it!  I know 60% of BAH isn't much.  She also needs to have a consultation with an attorney for the divorce and possible alimony if she hasn't worked during the marriage.  Tell her to go to legal aid, and have the attorney request of the judge that her spouse pay for the divorce.  Good Luck!
8OYONwrpaa	From whom did you receive the letter?  Your US citizen uncle was the one who filed the I-130 which should have been approved and sent to the American embassy where you reside within a month or so after the filing date, which is your mother's priority date for issuance of an  immigrant visa.

fAcVndo7aa	A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.    Note that it does not say that the Militia alone is allowed to bear arms; it states that it is the right of the *people* to bear arms.      The debate is ongoing about the grammar of the amendment.  The interpretation that is most upheld is that it is simply stating, since it's important to have a militia, the people should be allowed to have guns.  In the time frame when the amendment was written, guns were not issued to members of the military; men had to provide their own.  Therefore, if they did not have a gun, they would not be able to be part of the armed militia - putting them at a distinct disadvantage.    The word "bear" has several meanings, one of which is "to carry".  Would you rather have people carry guns, which they do not own?  That's another law entirely.    But I see that you aren't really interested in debate, you just want to *****, moan, groan, and complain.  Have at it.|`|6nS62bB8aa	Actually, about a year ago, the Supreme Court ruled that the Second Amendment is an individual right. The vote was five to four, it passed by one vote.

If citizens weren't intended to be allowed to own guns, why does the 2nd Amendment say "the right of the PEOPLE" rather than the "right of the MILITIA".|`|k690naOhaa	Did they teach you anything in school, like perhaps, how to read?  Did the part of the second amendment where is says the right of the people to keep and bear arms not print in your copy of the Constitution?  The amendments were meant to illuminate the rights that the PEOPLE retain, not the State.|`|IDZTtipeaa	The Second Amendment has been interpreted throughout the course of our history by our highest court to apply to a private citizen's right to own guns, albeit with restrictions.  The latest example:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_of...    It really doesn't matter if you "care" what the Supreme Court has ruled.  That is the final law of the land.  Their job is to interpret laws, many of which were made long ago.  Of course these decisions can and probably will be changed over time, but until then they are the absolute final law of the land.|`|4ul7fEqNaa	Here's the deal. Our Constitutional rights are NOT at the mercy of how some weirdo can manipulate the wording to fit an agenda. It is interpreted in the manner which our founding fathers intended. We have all their notes, journals, and personal correspondences. Their true intentions for our rights are written in these papers. An INDIVIDUALS rights are upheld by each and every one of them in their notes. Its irrelevant anyhow. My AR-15 Carbine and four 30 round magazines along with 3,000 rounds of .223REM are all I need to protect my right to bear arms. I will exercise this right until the day I die and I will invoke the Death Penalty on anyone who tries to impead that right.

At a minimum, the Senate should ensure that the final package includes two critical elements of the Finance Committee package: extension of unemployment insurance (UI) and rebate payments for those whose income consists of Social Security or veterans disability benefits.    Working families have seen their purchasing power stripped and their economic well-being eroded by rising unemployment, declining real wages, and rising costs for necessities such as gas, housing, and health care. To be effective, a stimulus package must help those hardest hit by the economic downturn and put money into the hands of those most likely to spend it quickly. The expanded rebate provisions, extensions of UI, and increased home heating assistance in the Senate package fit both of these criteria and should be quickly enacted.    While the stimulus package is welcome, much more remains to be done to address the underlying causes of our economys weakness and the decline in worker living standards. In the short run, Congress should pass additional stimulus measures to provide: aid to the states, funds to accelerate ready-to-go construction and neglected infrastructure repair projects, and increases in food stamps to help those struggling to pay for necessities.    Sustained economic recovery ? for our country and our nations working families ? is made in working America. The purchasing power of working families, and thus economic growth, is fueled by good jobs with wages that can support a family and that provide affordable health care and adequate retirement benefits.    Sincerely,  (your name)    (EDIT: I'm a funny guy, no?)

There is a student of the week, per school.  Every week of the school year.      That is allot of bumper stickers!!!|`|dBpmyIduaa	Wow, what a lot of cynical people out there.  As a teacher, I find the fact that any parent would proudly display an accomplishment from their child a good thing.  There are so many parents out there who do not seem to care one way or the other.  I am sure this is something that schools are doing in the elementary grades, so is not something that will be going on into middle and high school levels.  Young children need to be encouraged and this is the school's way of encouraging them.  I am speaking from the point of view of someone who works in an inner city school and we have this program as well, only ours is monthly.  Not only are we encouraging the children, but the parents as well.  They are so proud of their child and this helps them to get more interested in their education, even if they had no education of their own, are homeless, in destructive relationships,  etc.  At least from my prospective and experiences, I do not feel that this has anything to do with PC, but everything to do with helping to change the outcome of the very poorest children in our nation!|`|0V2HxKGZaa	Unfortunately, it is a freedom of speech issue.       I do agree with the first answer that if we are going to celebrate achievement with a bumper sticker, it should at least be a significant accomplishment.

FaMDdmjwaa	This statement is not racist. The fact that racism existed is ineffable, however, your point is simply that 40 years ago children (such as our current president) regardless of race were dreaming of becoming president. I would agree with the true meaning of the question, however I read an article in Time, I believe, that said that Obama did not really aspire to become president until a little later in his life. I believe that it has been a possibility for all children to aspire to be president regardless of race, gender, creed, etc. Having a black man as president gives children hope and affirmation that their dreams are obtainable. I think that is more what this statement is about. To say that only now can black children aspire to be president is mildly naive because children can aspire to be anything-especially in this nation. I believe that the statement issues simply means that now it can be a reality.|`|kuIKAGkeaa	people who still only focus on his color would say that|`|TFdKrkP2aa	Only racist say things like this.|`|AXNkmdbKaa	You are of course right.

In my area of Upstate NY a concealed carry permit application has a snowball's chance in H*** of being approved.  The permit fee is non-refundable!  Look carefully before you start the process, getting that concealed carry permit is not as easy as you might think.  NY is not a "shall issue" state, it is a "might issue at the discretion of the judge but probably not" state.    Having said that, on the chance that you actually get any kind of pistol permit in the state of NY, join a gun club.

We should have learned that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of the beliefs of the people to pursue life, liberty and happiness, it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new government, (or none at all) laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness.     Some would even argue, and I would agree, that the Constitution never had the authority we've all assumed it did.  http://jim.com/treason.htm|`|ggBfHk1waa	It's Thomas Jefferson isn't it?

Also because somebody around here has got to work at a real job.|`|95gEZ22Caa	caligirl  is talking real sweet and refreshing !!!!|`|Ow3iwCJlaa	Both but mostly Social issues I guess but really it is both, though Yeah Social -      I am a Jesus Freak and well I dont think it is possible to be a real Bible Believing Christian and be supportive of a Democrat in general (Abortion first and foremost but there are a few others) We are our brothers keeper and in order to raise people out of poverty and generational cycles, indoctrination and mental slavery is not the way to do it. I like Jesuss plan of Hope and Hard work for those who can and it takes a village for those who cant  Government is never the solution just a tool for the people to utilize though it often becomes the problem. In a way like the church we all pool our little bit of money $5 here a dollar there and some a thousand and individually it may not do much but help a homeless guy/gal get another drink or a lick but together it can change lives, build homes, and help to rebuild lives and families so we all come together for a common cause pooling our monies together in the form of tithes to help one another and others who are down and out or in need. So Yeah I guess Social is the main one but the two are not exclusive from each other (in reality) it is like saying which do you prefer hope or faith ? what is one with out the other?      I know it was probably supposed to be a straight forward answer right? let me go read what others wrote now lol    Edit: I am a far right wing conservative|`|AVc1PCu5aa	Because I care so much for this country|`|nz8U5rNaaa	Both but Fiscal is more important to me.

I'm a sucker for people seeking office telling me things can be made better by people in power actually trying things. Doing something about it.    Often I am disappointed in the lack of priorities though.    As a nation we've already handled a lot of the social issues really well so far already. More than anyone really expected.    We've also become quite bankrupt as a nation in our fiscal priorities.    The damage has been done. Now we must stop the bleeding and pay the price for such irresponsibility.    The reckoning of the markets is here.  At last at least everyones eyes are partly open to it now though. At least there's that.  No one is completely economically blind anymore.|`|eIhD4y8Waa	You can't separate fiscal and social issues they are intertwined in liberty and freedom.Thats where principle and hypocracy come into play.The only party that is devoid of hypocracy,and based on principle is the libertarian party.It is the party the founders would chose hands down.Give me liberty or give me death.The democrats have had there chance,the republicans have had their chance,now the democrates have thier umpteenth chance.What our you gonna do when the democrats screw up again,vote in the republicans?

yQ0OzEbZaa	The same old borrow-spend-panic-repeat cycle that got us into our current mess in the first place. This is not an investment in Americas future. Its an unprecedented mortgaging of Americas future should be call the Generational Theft Act of 2009.     This plan is the old-style pork-barrel spending -- not stimulus:    ? $6 billion for colleges/universities -- many which have billion-dollar endowments.  ? $166 billion in direct aid to states -- many of which have failed to budget wisely.  ? $50 million in funding for the National Endowment of the Arts.  ? $44 million for repairs to U.S. Department of Agriculture headquarters.  ? $200 million for the National Mall, including grass planting.    House Democrats plan will cost each household $16,700 in debt, which will be paid for by our children and grandchildren.     Create or save 3 million jobs -- which means this plan will spend $275,000 per job.    It is crucial to recall the reality that lies behind the rhetoric. The media is still cocooned in a warm comfort zone of infatuation with Americas answer to god himself. We should be long past applauding politicians of any color. They got us into this mess.

He is also using the stimulus package to better the educational system and provide medicare to something like 8 million people that wouldn't have it otherwise.  He is using it to make the existing power grids more effeicient and also provide money to expand renewable energy.  He's using it to provide tax relief to the people he said he would. Those are all things he said he would do.  Seems to me like he is at least trying.  Do you actually expect him to do everything he promised to do in the first week.  Hell I don't expect he will be able to do it in 4 years or even 8 but at least he knows what needs to be done.|`|d1a2d96d28c063a31c38d6ccbb050904aa	He's a politician...say one thing to get elected, and go back to work as usual.|`|cumnSTuvaa	He did claim he would bring Everyone together?  ....That's not a question.

Obama states the next stimulus plan will not carry pork how can we believe this man. I don't see an end to this recession he is only setting us up for hyperinflation and generations will be paying for his mistakes. I don't know how he plans on tackling health care, medicare and other major issue like social security. I expect he will have to resort to monopoly money very soon.

WCkOUF9aaa	TAX CUTS!!!!    The people that think this money is being well spent need to look deeper into it. I think it borders on criminal looting of our country.    S.K. Aren't they tax credits and not a lower tax rate? You do realize that most of the proposed stimulus is not aimed at infrastructure right? Please research on your own & dont just buy the party line.|`|OFA2LAM5aa	A tax cut alone would not spurn enough job creation. The stimulus package includes tax cuts to the middle class but also creates jobs in all levels of the economy, not just service related.    This is important since jobs that include infrastructure building and repair require skilled labor and a large workforce.  These jobs will in turn create further jobs down the line in industrial manufacturing. We have continually lost jobs in this sector.  It will not only strengthen the economy but the nation will be more secure with these types of jobs being done in country.

AA11487579	"Deficit" refers just to the difference between how much money the government receives in taxes and how much it spends on programs in one given year. The "debt" refers to all the cash America owes because of the many years its government ran a deficit.<br>  <br>  So if he halves the deficit (I believe he was using 2008 as a reference point), then it will definitely be smaller than at least some of the Bush deficits; however, the debt will be larger since we'll be borrowing more money in 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012.<br>  <br>  It's a very unfortunate state of affairs, but halving the deficit in four years is going to be a challenging goal to meet in and of itself. This year's budget will have a massive deficit because of the stimulus, but most of the programs created in it will expire by 2012 and won't thus be paid for, and a lot of the taxes will either either expire or be rolled back as part of an effort to start cutting the deficit.<br>  <br>  It would be nice to stop adding to our national debt, but the goal is actually a good starting point.

Finally, Bush inherited a surplus.  He inherited much more than a recession, prosperity.  I dont know, even most conservative economists will tell you Bush screwed up.  Any other statement is denial.

When it comes to money they tend to look through a tinted glass, especially if they're wealthy and aren't feeling the effects as much as the rest of us.  I agree with you about the stimulus package and spending, it needs to happen.  Without money being spent the economy can't turn around, but it's so hard for us to spend when we now have so little compared to before.  Politics are hard and for Republicans money is a touchy issue.  They like to hold onto their money and keep it there, not spend it and put it into the country.  Tax cuts only help so much, but as you said once those people lose their job and therefore income there's nothing a tax break can do for them.  Republicans survive on the idea that we won't lose our jobs and won't lose our income that we therefore spend.  It's so easy to think we're invincible, but it's entirely untrue therefore dangerous to believe in.|`|2g7niBEIaa	YES ! We understand. If you cut income tax, I'll have more money to spend on goods and services, thus putting money into the economy now. If you spend a billion dollars on pork, and things that won't add anything to the economy for at least two years, you'll have to raise taxes, thus redusing my ability to spend.  The problem with the democrats is, they want to decide how your money is spent. They don't want you to decide.
BLMh0dG6aa	You'll probably get better answers in small business under busnsiness and finance|`|Swmd0P2uaa	Check out the collectors 66 gold coins. If gold will go up, you can make a 10-20% profit in a few weeks. Dont think you should buy just any gold coins. Collectors coins, because if the dollar drops far enough the treasury can LEGALLY take your gold so they have something to back our currency. (of course they would give you compensation, but not enough to be profit in your wallet). Or you could look at some day trades. I found some interesting stocks going up right about now, but you really have to buy- and sell right away, its not worth the risk of loosing it the day after when it tanks. Accounting services are really profitable. Credit unions were always a good way to go because they spent something like 50 cents of every dollar on over head... but I dont know whats going on with that in the future..<br>  <br>  You could start selling books via internet. A lot of small books stores got really big this way. Selling used books for a few bucks doesnt sound that great but you do get 4.00 for shipping no matter what size it is. It sure wouldnt cost much, (you just say "Im shipping media mail" when you go in the post office and it will cost you a lot less then the actual weight of the package) So there is some money to be made in that. <br>  <br>   I know this sounds completly uninteresting but give it a thought- a business where you pick up elderly folks for medical appointments, grocery store or church visits. You can charge by the mile plus so much down. You would be surprised how many elderly people there are living on their own- but not really doing so well. Plus, you would be profitable in years to come as the Baby Boomer generation (The largest generation ever) starts to get older.

XoAwzQ5Yaa	Sure, you could pretend it blew off. But, they don't really buy that. Even if it really did, they still think your full of crap. What they end up doing is charging you late fees, so the amount of the ticket increases. Some states will put a warrant out for you if it goes on too long. Eventually, it will catch up to you. My father (ok, he have several tickets) ignored all of them. When he went to renew his license, he had to pay over 3000 in fines (the tickets only added up to about 250). He walked out of there, because he didn't have it. So, when his plates expired, they wouldn't let him renew. Before you knew it, he had to pay all the fees, retake his license test, and it cost a fortune in time and money.  Best thing to do is to pay the stupid thing, before it gets to the point where you really can't afford it.|`|HQ4PsETWaa	If the lot is owned by the school there is very little they can do about it.  That means the school wrote the ticket.    If it was regular parking, the police wrote the ticket, then you better pay it soon.  It will gain interest, your car may get impounded, and you may get arrested.|`|8063947433f50c3e93546a4ba2133fdcaa	If you haven't heard anything by now I wouldn't worry too much. It could still be on your driving record though, and the cops could pull you over and suspend your license and even arrest you. By now it has probably racked up some late charges. But I don't know how much they'll worry about chasing you over $25.|`|YGwvoUPTaa	why do you repeatedly post this question instead of just paying off the damn ticket? are you an adult or an irresponsible child? oh wait, judging by your desire to take in baby wolves, i'd say you're an irresponsible child. i hope your ticket sends you to jail. you need to be kept off the streets.|`|9bgsyndIaa	Better watch your driving, if you get pulled over they will take you to jail for not paying the unpaid ticket.|`|AA11570236	Yes and go to warrant.|`|AA10301974	They will simply report it to the police who will send the person a fine notice, with the information on how to pay it. Eventually if you don't pay it they will seize the money either from your bank accounts or paycheck.     The decision on increasing the fine will be made according to local laws and regulations. No one can tell you without checking the local regulations first.

It's OK though, he only kills white people to give their land to blacks.  It's not a crime if it's a white guy.  He's a Champion of the far left, and works hard to promote socialism.  He ranks ahead of Hugo Chavez, and the lefties love him for it.  If he came to America and called the whities the devil, there are plenty of hollywood types that would welcome him and hug him on stage, just like they did Chavez.    Is that the guy you were asking about?  He's a hero to the left, and not liked very much by the right.|`|TEsq9K54aa	Oh bummer?  No one is quite sure which country he is from!  .
2dfe1a04cbba62e3fc3fa1e11c8562e9aa	You can never lie no matter the reason. It's called perjury and is a crime regardless of religious persuasion.|`|70e9d9eee37ee3f1f4008f4ae6b92dc8aa	The court doesn't force anyone to take the bible oath, I have never seen a bible used in a court proceeding.    Most often you will recite an affirmation to tell the truth. If you don't your open to perjury charges.|`|AA11598520	No, they don't make you swear on a bible. In fact, they don't use the bible at all anymore. They make you raise your hand and swear that you will tell the truth, unless you are morally opposed to swearing in which case they make you affirm that you will tell the truth.     So, there is not way to twist it so you can lie and lying under oath to a court is a felony. Ask Bill Clinton.|`|nDQOwAA3aa	well i don't thank you even have to put your hand on the bible anymore but you can be charged with perjury if they can prove your lying and thats like a 10,000 dollar fine|`|10554e42be61cc129e1f63de5ce47d79aa	Well, in court you are taking an oath... you SWEAR not to lie... it is a legal binding contract, but it is not the same as breaking an oath with God. If you are truly Christian, then you should not be even worrying about this matter. You wouldnt need an oath because you wouldnt lie.|`|oFcrglxzaa	an oath means that you understand that false statements carry penalties which are set by the court and carried out by the presiding judge.|`|AA12225622	They don't use a bible anymore.    At least where I live.|`|fbf036d0bcf69547cc9d92e1f54de8d8aa	That's right! So, what they should ask is," Do you swear on your mothers and/or fathers grave, to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth?" Then see how many people lie!|`|mXPKHYEDaa	actually most say, "do you swear or affirm,' and there is no Bible.  Just raise your hand.  If somebody has a problem with reciting "so help me God" or anything remotely religious, simply affirming that what you will testify to is true will be sufficient to bring perjury charges for lying, or contempt charges.      Any way you want to slice it, the court deserves a certain amount of deference.  If you think you are smarter than the judicial system because you're not christian and therefore allowed to lie.  Good luck
bkav003oaa	Perhaps, but that would not be very smart politically.

J2PxEzBkaa	The new legislation is being distributed to multiple strata rather than the top.  So in order to try and repair it, the government must make an investment.<br>  <br>  Let us say, for example we run a successful donut shop, but a few months down the road, we sort of lose it.  Though our chocolate and vanilla donuts sell well and are quality products, for some reason, people just stop coming.  We are rapidly losing our capital.  Do we just wait it out, hoping that it will get better?  Not usually, we do something.  Whatever we do is going to have an initial cost, whether it is advertising, product development, or multiple other things.  Something has to give.<br>  <br>  As far as it being stable, all we can really do is hope that we get the wheels turning on the U.S. economy again.  Most economists have absolutely no firm stance on what caused this recession, and so we can only guess how to solve it.  Right now, we have had government funds distributed all over to try and find this leak(s).<br>  <br>  Is this contradictory?  Not exactly.

28b037c9067df2ec28f25fbd2bab84e3aa	Obama has never stated an intention to cut the debt in half, ore to cut the budget in half either, as one other answerer believes.  He has stated he intends to cut the annual deficit in half, and he has a decent chance to succeed by the following means:<br>  <br>  Removing most troops from Iraq, saving about $100 Bn a year.<br>  <br>  Allowing most Bush tax cuts to expire, another $100 Bn or more per year.<br>  <br>  Instituting a cap and trade system for carbon emissions.<br>  <br>  Reducing excessive health care expenditures.  It isn't widely known that most wealthy countries actually spend less taxpayer money per capita on health care than we do - even though they have universal coverage and we don't.  The American system is very wasteful and inefficient, and a huge burden on taxpayers, businesses, and citizens.<br>  <br>  It won't be easy, but it is doable.|`|AA10331255	Obama is a huge disaster.<br>  He'll never cut the budget in half.

I don't get it either.|`|aFC72tLZaa	I'm not reading all that gibberish.  I'll just answer your first question.  We have to put money into the economy that Bush destroyed to begin a recovery.  Obama  will attempt to cut the debt in half by the end of his term.  He has been president for 36 days and no one can see into the future.  So is he doing that?  No, I agree with you.  4 years is quite different fom 36 days.  Stop reading about Russian fortune tellers and support your president and try to recommend some ways out of the Bush nightmare.

a2b41ccb589c426ab88d369abd5054a0aa	It's the Limbaugh mentality. I hope that they do the same thing in the Senate with the stimulus bill that they totally voted against in the House. They want constant compromise (or for the Dems to totally give up everything) but want to offer nothing. The way it's going, Obama should give up trying to compromise with them and shove every piece of legislation he wants down their throats, just like their presidents would do. It's a great ideal to want to try to truly change the country but when you have the Republicans who are diametrically opposed to anything with the label 'Democrat' on it, there really isn't much hope.     He should have never caved in with the tax cuts that those idiots wanted (or at least waited until the bitter end and threw them a bone). If it was left up to the Republicans, people like Bernie Madoff would be put on a pedestal as a picture of what a true Republican is - make your money any way you can, even if it comes at the expense of the middle class, widows, the elderly, etc. I'm sure if we look back in history, the first Ponzi scheme was conducted by a Republican.

The stock market doesn’t like you. <br>  <br>  Only one month in and investors are giving up. Another 30% haircut would put the Dow at 5000.<br>  <br>  <br>  And that level wouldn’t just put a crimp into your presidency.

But that’s wrong. Especially today.<br>  <br>  At its core, the market is a measure of belief — the belief that investors can make money by buying a slice of America.<br>  <br>  And a plummeting Dow means they really don’t believe in the country. Or in you.  <br>  <br>  You need to turn this around and fast. Here’s some advice:<br>  <br>  1. Channel Ronald Reagan, not Jimmy Carter<br>   <br>  Everybody knows the economy is lousy. Everybody gets your “underpromise, overdeliver” routine.<br>  <br>  But if the economy doesn’t come around in a year, you’re still “wearing it” as they say on Wall Street.<br>  <br>  You’re the #1 salesman of America’s hopes and dreams. Quit moaning and go out and sell some optimism.  <br>  <br>  2. Enough already with class warfare<br>  <br>  Make no mistake. All that populist anti-Wall Street rhetoric in Washington scares the heck out of investors. <br>  <br>  What good comes from your Press Secretary attacking CNBC’s Rick Santelli? It makes the White House look weak and out of touch with the markets.<br>  <br>  Maybe you are. How else could you have signed Senator Christopher Dodd’s executive pay amendment into law? <br>  <br>  Forget that the amendment is poorly drafted, vindictive public policy. It serves nobody’s interests but the politicians who sponsored it.<br>  <br>  Dennis K. Berman<br>  <br>  <br>  Tell Harry Reid, Nancy Pelosi and your own staff to turn down the volume on the “outrage of the people.”  The election is long over.<br>  <br>  3. Rule out bank nationalization — even if you haven’t completely ruled it out <br>  <br>  Tell your Treasury Secretary to immediately announce that the nationalization of Citi and Bank of America is off the table.<br>  <br>  With their shares worth so little and the government already backstopping them, this is largely a matter of semantics.<br>  <br>  If you have to revisit “full nationalization” over the next couple of months, so what?<br>  <br>  Secretary Geithner can say the situation has changed. And it will have. The situation changes every day.<br>  <br>  4.  Make peace with Wall Street<br>  <br>  Go to New York, press the flesh and put some confidence into the markets simply by showing up.<br>  Meet with the same eight bank CEOs that were bashed two weeks ago by Rep. Barney Frank and his House Committee. <br>  <br>  Scold them for the cameras and then declare that a healthy America needs a healthy Wall Street. <br>  <br>  Announce on the NYSE floor that the SEC is re-instating the “uptick rule” as a way to protect small “Main Street” investors.<br>  <br>  Wall Street will give you a hero’s welcome.<br>  <br>  5. Shelve liberal, Democrat pet bills<br>  <br>  Why are your fellow Democrats so keen to frighten US industry?  Are US companies not terrified enough nowadays?<br>  <br>  Show that you want American business to win. Put the kibosh on Henry Waxman’s efforts to undo the Supreme Courts’ limitations on suing medical device makers. <br>  <br>  And while you’re at it, call for an indefinite postponement of the Employee Free Choice Act, the anti-business union card check bill. That one’s a real stock market no-no.<br>  <br>  6. Get the bipartisanship thing going<br>  <br>  It made investors nervous that Senator Judd Gregg ditched you and that you could only come up with 3 Republican votes on the stimulus.  Let’s get that bipartisan thing going.<br>  <br>  Join with the Republicans and put GM into bankruptcy. That’s the endgame anyway. Might as well co-opt the Republicans and give yourself some political cover.<br>  <br>  Of course, none of these measures is a guarantee that the stock market will go up. And certainly, many in your party will cry Judas.<br>  <br>  But you urgently need to do something to shift investor sentiment. Dow 5000 is in nobody’s interest. Especially not yours.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/deals/2009/02/23/mean-street-obamas-dow-5000/" rel="nofollow">http://blogs.wsj.com/deals/2009/02/23/me...</a>|`|ubGNtkHQaa	Ironically Republicans passed the Patriot act which will do the same thing you just said.|`|4eLzY2hfaa	wall street is a good indicator of consumer confidence which hit 20 year low yesterday.  today day after the messiah's message the market tanked again; that's six of the last seven days!  the market clearly believes that obama is in over his head, and many of us agree!  if he keeps giving negative speeches the market will totally tank!  i pulled out just after his election, and took a bath.  i'm getting back in, but not until he returns to whatever  he does best!  community organizer!!|`|pM81f5tnaa	Probably good, yeah.

At which time the market will ultimately crash yet again from the profits skimmed out all at once by the rich class thieving bankers, while the working class pensions fund the bill. Then the process will begin yet again - by now-obvious design of course.<br>  <br>  The roller coaster ride of Wall Street rich class economics is too dizzying to last for too much longer. The ripping off of the vast breadth of workers into the few rich class tax shelter accounts is as blatant by now as the number of vacated middle-class homes.<br>  <br>  The working class is finally smartening up after 200 years, and aren't falling for the scam anymore.

Women are prohibited from wearing patent leather shoes in public.  4. It is illegal to get a fish drunk.  5. You must honk your horn whenever you pass another car.  6. No one may be arrested on Sunday or the 4th of July.  7. Participating in a duel is strictly prohibited.  8. Breastfeeding is not allowed in public.  9. In Ohio, if you ignore an orator on Decoration day to such an extent as to publicly play croquet or pitch horseshoes within one mile of the speaker's stand, you can be fined $25.00.   10. It is illegal for more than 5 women to live in one house.  11. It is illegal to walk a cow down lake road in Bay city.  12. Ordinance number 223, of 09/09/19 prohibits the installation and usage of slot machines in outhouses.   13. It is illegal to catch mice without a hunting license.  14. In Columbus it is illegal for stores to sell Corn Flakes on Sunday.  15. And in Marion, Ohio it is illegal to eat a donut while walking backwards down a city street.|`|AA10863966	I am guessing that 1 is actually a slightly re-worded version of a hunting law where it is illegal to sight moose by airplane, you can't go flying around looking for them just to land and shoot them, so that works.    And number 2 is to prevent stupid tourists from messing with hibernating bears.    Both I am guessing are taken from Alaska laws that do make sense but are worded here to sound funnier.|`|NQYKzv7faa	A lot of those make sense.|`|OZXmuZUSaa	I have to agree with the first answer, a lot of those make sense.

That is just wrong.
KZNVb7ehaa	Me and my husband are both in the military, but he is the one that is the crew chief. He seems to love his job, but i think a lot of people hate it. I work in an office and people that come over to my squadron that has worked in maintenance talk about how much better it is in my squadron than in maintenance.  You have to work outside in the cold or heat, whichever and you could work any shift. being new you will most likely be on weekends or night shift.  I work in an office and work 7-4 monday-friday.
JDltTREfaa	No.  Many collisions are non-reportable.  Officers are only required to complete reports under specific conditions.  The reason officers are not required to complete a report on every single collision is that this is a very time consuming chore - and departments are usually undermanned and overworked.  The motive is to get officers moving to the next call as quickly as possible.    Be really careful about filing a complaint - the officer can sue you if you are dishonest in any way.  Officers aren't required to fill out a report on every collision.  It sounds as though the officer who investigated your collision wasn't required by his department to fill out a report.  Your complaint should NOT be against the officer.  It sounds as though he did his job - and frankly, the fact that he cited the other driver gives you all of the ammunition you really need in your lawsuit.  Your complaint is with the police department and the fact that it does not require a report on every collision.  What would your motive be in filing a complaint?  He's not going to write a retroactive report now (and you should be grateful for that because it probably wouldn't be favorable to you if you complain about him!).  A complaint is not going to help your lawsuit in any way.  If you sue the other driver, you can call the officer to testify on your behalf.  You don't need a report.  Is it really a good idea to file a complaint against him when you're going to need/want his cooperation later?      Ask for a copy of the citation the other driver received.  The citation will be ample evidence against the other driver.  (If she didn't have a license, the court should assume that she was at fault because she wasn't even supposed to be operating a vehicle.  If she hadn't been driving the vehicle, there would have been no accident.  At the very least, the burden will be on HER to prove the accident was not her fault.  You shouldn't have any trouble winning your lawsuit and you darn sure do NOT need a report!)|`|u6ALw1gAaa	This happened in May and you're just now worrying about it?    State laws require Officers to write reports for certain accident types.  In my State is determined by dollar amount, injuries involved, fatalities, or an accident involving a vehicle that is going to be seized.  If the Officer has any doubt about the accident or the law does not require a report then we do not have to file a report.    You should have spoken with the Officer's supervisor that day.|`|0cc280908f5890dc4f887659d66561b6aa	File a complaint at the Prosecution Office against the police officer and an administrative case at his office so that he will be investigated.|`|cWmx0J4jaa	I was a claim adjuster for southern CA for many years. The cops in LA I found wouldn't write any accident report unless someone was taken away in an ambulance. We had many accidents with no report as they got so short-staffed they basically told people to handle it themselves.    I do know if the damages are over a certain dollar amount then YOU have to file a report with DMV. But I'm not sure if the PD has a duty to file reports. Good luck.|`|cCjmNgTnaa	Certain states have different requirements and police officers are not bound by law to write a report.  However if they don't file the report, you can.  States have self reporting systems.    Insurance companies drive me nuts asking why there is no report sometimes, thats becuase we are not bound by law to write one.      But generally, if the damage is over $500 or injuries involved, there will be a report.  Anything less, don't count on it.|`|mlDV1Xsqaa	In Minnesota, we will always have an ICR on hand (Initial Complaint Report). These records are kept on hand and we always have access to them. If the total damages are over $1,000 we have to file a report with the state. We used to do this on paper and have to send it in, it is now all online.   Here are some tips to keep you out of these situations from now on. Have a camera and get pictures. Speak with any other drivers or witnesses and ask if they would be willing to support you in your story. As of right now I would suggest reporting this to the officers supervisor and see if there is anything more they could do for you.

PHQy22VUaa	I believe most of it has to do with the Jewish belief system, or ideology. The 'Jewish' belief system is based on a kind of racism, and self - entitlement   (the   'we are chosen'   hogwash for example)  . this type of archaic philosophy seeds nothing, but for the most part,   trouble.  a tribe of non-assimilation ,  in todays world this doesn't work.  Example the failed state of Israel. You know, I must say, I am sick of being so harsh on this whole Israeli thing and I have met  some very cool Jewish people that have a certain consciousness, but I think the real problem is from an ingrained sense of distance they create from the 'goy or gentile' as they call it, that is not only offensive, but ridiculous. I know no other group that is so supremest in their mind set, as a collective I mean. and really as I said, that does not roll in the real world especially in the supposed era of enlightenment we all strive for. I think the 'Jewish' philosophy  was orginally developed for survival in days of lore, but to bring that way of thinking in todays world is just ugly. Many religions die for a reason. Maybe the Jewish one should, as, granted, the Muslim one should. Yes, freedom of religion and all that, but when a belief system causes so much death, pain, others money at all cost... maybe they should re-think it. and yes, I think the same for those  wacko zionist christians that think al the Jews need to move back to Israel for Jesus to come.. Look, if Jesus is going to come... he's going to come, with or with out the Jews all gathered in Palestine. <br>  <br>  check the new nomination Chas Freeman jr. for the NIC - by Obama- he is excellent.

To be  "'dumb" means to be without the power of speech or hearing. In that regard, the war was set off by the assassination of Arch Duke Ferdinand in by Serbia nationalists. <br>  <br>  Once that happened, the series of secret treaties kicked in, so perhaps in that respect, it was "dumb", meaning the consequences were unknown and/or unavoidable.<br>  <br>  The principles, German, Austria, Russia, France, England, stumbled into a world war because of such secret treaties. Once the switch was thrown (Austria declaring war on Serbia, after an unrealistic ultimatium) it was pretty well automatic; mobilization orders were issued by Germany, Russia.<br>  <br>  You will want to see Barbara Tuckman's "August, 1914" for a full appreciation of this. Once the fuse was lit, there was not turning back. That is one of the reasons for Wilson's 14 Points at the Treaty of Versailled, "open covenants, openly arrived at", ie, everyone must know the cards, face up.
dJnRFpWWaa	The Bush bailout, otherwise known as the Troubled Asset Relief Plan (TARP), focuses on the American financial economy almost exclusively.    President Obama's economic stimulus package is aimed not at injecting fresh capital into banks to ensure their solvency, but instead aims to stimulate the consumption of goods and services directly through unemployment benefit funding, food stamps and other transfer payments, and indirectly by encouraging public works projects that create jobs that pay good wages and have a significant multiplier effect which will further stimulate the American economy and for a longer period of time than the shorter-term direct stimulus components.

I am not 100% on this but I think that i am close to it as possible.
JDltTREfaa	Yep.  It is a habit that has blossomed into an addiction.  I worked as a store detective for Kmart back when I was in college - and frankly, shoplifters are a dime a dozen.  Why don't retail stores spend more time catching shoplifters?  Frankly because shoplifters don't steal nearly as much as employees.  I would spend maybe one to three hours catching shoplifters and and six to nine hours investigating employees.    (The biggest shoplifting bust I ever made was $900 and that was HUGE.  The average is around $50 to $100.  The biggest employee theft bust I made was over $100,000.)    You only think that you know how not to get caught.  The truth of the matter is that you're not being watched or investigated because most customers are not watched or investigated.  Is it likely that you're a skilled shoplifter?  Absolutely.  But when I was doing this job I would just randomly focus on any customer in the store and would keep an eye on them.  This was how I caught a pair of sisters:  aged 87 and 93 for shoplifting.  (Incidentally, they were charged with burglary - a felony.)  They told me and the police officer that they had been stealing for over 60 years and had never gotten caught.  If I needed or wanted to boost my arrest statistics for that month, I would focus on teenage and preteen girls - because my experience told me that 95% of them have sticky fingers.    Is it possible that you'll continue to get away with stealing?  Absolutely.  But chances are pretty good that you'll get caught eventually.  What would getting caught to do you?  One of the girls I popped was a 21 year old college student who was all set to join the FBI after her graduation.  The shoplifting conviction ended her dream of being an FBI agent.  Would an arrest hurt your future?  Probably not if you're planning a career as a waitress, etc., but if you actually want a job in a position of trust it could devastate your future.    Do you really want to stop?  I don't know if you do.  If you really want to stop you need to sit down and tell your parents what you've been doing and that you need help.  Also, if you really want to stop you will STOP GOING INTO STORES.  Alcoholics shouldn't go into bars.  Shoplifters need to stay out of stores and malls.  If you don't absolutely need something you have no business being in a store.  If you need something walk straight in, get what you want, pay for it and leave.  No wandering the aisles.    It takes a person with a very strong character to break an addiction.  It takes a weak person to succumb to their addictive behaviors.  Are you strong or are you weak?  It's up to you.|`|ohgrMZDkaa	My aunt had this problem and she just did it for fun, she got help for it and now she is fine. So get help, but I used to do this and it is pretty fun I must say, especially getting away with big stuff.|`|UKGhLrdZaa	DUMMY JUST STOP TRY TO STOP DOING IT|`|LlYyGYSJaa	Have fun with that, chances are you have been spotted by now. Security in stores keep track of shoplifters and let you get away with it a couple times before they actually take action against you. This way they have recorded evidence of you doing the crime on more than one occasion which allows them to press stiffer charges and since you did it more than once, you will not get let off easy. Keep going and it will catch up with you.

Bush condoned torture and black sites while illegally eavesdropping on innocent Americans.  He ignored the housing, health care, banking, and credit crises.  His administration outed a covert CIA agent, and he ignored New Orleans (which remains in need the promised funding).  Bush pandered to his base by placing ideology over scientific fact.  Bush & Co. politicized every level of government, including (most egregiously) the Justice Department.  Bush had no energy policy except for Cheney's secret meetings with the likes of Exxon/Mobile and Ken Lay (Bush's buddy).  Oh, and 9/11 occurred on Bush's watch after numerous warnings from the intelligence communities and the previous administration,<br>  not to mention the PDB that Bush ignored in the summer of 2001 that stated "bin Laden determined to attack inside the U.S".  <br>    <br>  On the economy, here are a few more items from the Bush agenda that will haunt us for generations:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1872229_1872230_1872231_00.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.time.com/time/specials/packag...</a>|`|9BcQ5XMXaa	You seem like a dumbass ... we can't say Iraq because of Afghanistan (do you know it's two different countries???)<br>  <br>  Patriot Act?

Ar00Kkgkaa	The problem with buying is you have no idea of how long you will be there.  Purchasing a house is a tough decision in the military.  You might never go back to Ft Hood (lucky you), will you be able to sell it?  Could you rent it?  If you rent it how will you be able to manage the property?    My suggestion is to get a feel as to whether or not you might want to make the military a career.  Most friends who bought homes tried to buy then where they wanted to retire.  They then used a management company to rent the units out.    I'd say rent if this is your first duty station.  Plus the economy for resales is tough right now.  Even in big military town further depreciation in the home price could occur.|`|4f6e1488eea68ccac928d6e0d6f6e5caaa	I dont know how long you will be stationed there, but for enlisted ranks I would reccomend renting.  Base housing may be an option as well, but I think the quality is kind of low for enlisted housing.|`|9tcv3TiWaa	You are better off waiting until you get down there before you make your decision.  Check the market, what is good, what is bad, how much it has dropped or gone up within the past few years.  Renting at first might not be a bad option and then decide.  Take the buying a house class through Family Services and that can help as well.  If you are going to buy make sure the mortgage is about $300 or more under what hte BAH for that area is.  This way you can cover utilities, property tax, insurance, dues, etc..

We, that is the United States of America need reformed Immigration laws.  Those laws must deal swiftly with illegal immigration and undocumented workers.  This must include humane returns to their country of origin.  It must include a change to our laws to exclude anchor babies, grant citizenship but only allow the claim to be made by the "adult" upon their majority with proof of live birth in the US, no more residency status for the parent.    Finally it must include steep fines for anyone found to employ undocumented workers.      Illegals have rights, they have the same rights that anyone else has visiting our country.  They have the right to leave the same way the got here.  What they don't have is the right to lay claim upon the resources of this nations infrastructure.  What they don't have is the right to lay claim upon this nations government.  What they don't have is Civil Rights, beyond those granted to all human beings in a humane world.      We do need smart and efficient borders.  We need them to ensure that the flow of illegal workers and their families into this country stops.  Want full Civil Rights?  Demand them of your own government.  Want better working opportunities and conditions?  Demand them of your own country and government.  Want better educational opportunities?  That is right, demand them of your own country.    Want to come to the United States of America?  Do so legally.  Apply and have something to offer that this nation needs.  Jump through the hoops and do it the right way.  When you get here, claim citizenship proudly; fly an American flag, speak the common tongue.      Otherwise stay where you are.  This is America, a melting pot certainly.  A land of diverse cultures and heritage.  A grand land of opportunity without doubt.  But for far too long we, the American people have been afraid to say you can't come here and make demands, we don't speak Spanish here we speak English....learn it, or go home.

LJkPRqN0aa	to tell you the truth i dont see how this is age discrimination. if you dad is going to retire anyway then there shouldnt be any problem companies have the right to let people go, even if he is a devoted person that is a good worker. that doesnt make him better than any other employee...<br>  <br>  repeating it wont do you any good. if he doesnt want to retire then thats kind of tough on his part. like i said before, companies can do what they please....there is nothing legal you can do.|`|RhDPB70Baa	If they're a privately owned organization then they can do whatever they want.|`|AA11182621	Well I would suggest that your father contact a a lawyer who specialises in employment law to discuss his problems. <br>  It is very difficult to say if he has a case or not, without understanding more detail, in particular that he was forced to leave.<br>  <br>  He could ring a few lawyers and explain what has happened and ask questions of his rights and that of their employers.<br>  <br>  Ageism is illegal and he maybe entitled to compensation or the right to return to work.|`|qhENBYAHaa	You are a good daughter to look out for your dad.  It is against Federal law (ADEA) in the U.S. to terminate an employee due to their age, as long as the age is over 40.  There are other requirements and your state may have additional legal protection.  You may want to look at www.eeoc.gov for more information on age discrimination and for your state's human rights department.<br>  <br>  You may also want to speak with a local employment law attorney to see if he/she can explain all the options your dad has for filing a discrimination complaint.  There may be several things that can be done.<br>  <br>  Before you speak with an attorney let me suggest that you ask your dad how he feels about this.  Maybe he is ready to cut back and just work part-time.  Maybe the employer is giving him a very good (financially good) severance package that requires he NOT sue them to get the money.  Or maybe, like my dad was, he just wants to take some time off and pursue other options like opening his own business.  It sounds like he has the experience to become a consultant for certain charity organizations, maybe he wants to consider that.  Good luck to you both.

M3maZgdyaa	February 18, 2009 <br>  Putin warns US to eschew socialism<br>  Clarice Feldman<br>  <br>  What is the world coming to? Pat Dollard links to Peter Goodman's report the Russian leader warned the US against adopting socialism because it doesn't work:<br>  Russian Prime Minister Vladamir Putin has said the US should take a lesson from the pages of Russian history and not exercise “excessive intervention in economic activity and blind faith in the state’s omnipotence”.<br>  <br>  “In the 20th century, the Soviet Union made the state’s role absolute,” Putin said during a speech at the opening ceremony of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. “In the long run, this made the Soviet economy totally uncompetitive. This lesson cost us dearly. I am sure nobody wants to see it repeated.”[Snip.]<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2009/02/putin_warns_us_to_eschew_socia.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2009...</a>|`|1amF7oNwaa	Correct me if I am wrong but I don't think Communist governments are like ours where we have separate federal, state & local governments.  In a Communist government the local governments would only govern at the will of the Leader|`|lvBUl3Zdaa	No, central planning is an important part of communist governments. Everything comes from committees at the top. People at local levels are there to carry out the plans, not create them. <br>  <br>  Marx was a philosopher, not a pragmatist who was working with an actual communist government. ∠°)|`|LXpQp7Hbaa	No!<br>  <br>  In a pure communist government all levels of government are part of the same political machine.|`|b538976641cc2a50041772f307796f66aa	No because there would have to be pure people involved. Since there are no perfect people it would be impossible.|`|AA12176505	Has it ever happened anywhere else?|`|5KjvNg2oaa	no, theyre wouldnt be local governors, the "people" would own everything. in the true vision of communism, there is no need for government because society evolved to the point where everything is equal and no one is envious or jealous and it wouldnt be needed.  socialism is the step in between communism in which the governors would be needed|`|dkVKLymqaa	No dictator would ever give up power after being the supreme cheese. In truth, would you?
haeaGCdqaa	It would depend on the types of convictions involved.  If all three were considered to be "violent" felonies, he would be sentenced to life.  A third conviction for a first degree felony mandates a thirty year prison term; a second degree felony results in a fifteen year sentence; a third degree felony results in five years. It is important to note, that although the court must impose a sentence at least as long as that specified by the law, the judge is still given discretion to impose a longer sentence if the law allows it.  I do not know what level of security would be imposed, but I expect that he would be under close supervision as a convicted felon.  The prison will issue him his clothing and bedding.  He will probably be allowed to bring in nothing.|`|mduRdBDpaa	Ultimately, how much time he recieves would be up to the judge, and whether he was found guilty by a jury or accepted a plea agreement. However, his previous convictions will work against him.     His security level would be determined by the classification office. They use certain factors such as length of sentence, gang affiliation (if any) disciplinary record from his previous time served. Typically when going to prison inmates don't really take anything with them. They are issued hygene products and uniforms but not much more; however, they can have family send items or they can purchase items from the commisary.
4f6e1488eea68ccac928d6e0d6f6e5caaa	I don't think you are telling us the whole story.  You or more importantly your parents should have reported it to the police.|`|JDltTREfaa	Yep.  The police can absolutely pull you out of class without notifying your parents.  And yes, it is completely legal.    Parental consent/notification is generally not required for an officer to question/interview a minor, whether in attendance at a school or on a public street. As an FYI, neither the officer nor school officials are required to notify the parents before the minor is taken into custody. So you could even have been arrested at school.    Based on what you've typed, it sounds as though (at a minimum) you could be arrested for possession of stolen property and selling stolen property.  (Even if the "game system fairy" did really leave this bag in front of your house . . . which is not going to be something the police officer (or any other criminal justice professional) is going to believe . . . you don't simply get to keep it for two weeks and then sell it.  The law generally requires that you notify the police of your find and/or that you take out ads/post notices and wait at least 60 days to see if the owner will claim it before you have the right to sell the property.  So you absolutely did not have the right to sell those games even if you really did find them the way you described.)|`|AA10409832	As soon as you found the game system on your porch, you should have taken it to the police and told them how you found it.  Then, you would have been in the clear.  The system was not yours to sell, so if the system was stolen, you were dealing with stolen property, and you were selling stolen property.  Maybe someone was trying to set you up, and get you involved with the police on purpose.  If that is the case, they did a damn good job of it, and you fell right into their trap.  Yes, they can come to school to arrest you.  They could have arrested you at your home if they wanted to.  So until you can give all the facts to the police, and they believe what you are saying due to the evidence, you're busted for dealing in stolen property.  Nothing is free in this world.  Be careful, and good luck.

LRbWZhvnaa	Coalition governments are NOT good for Canada.     - Power grab by the opposition parties.     - Destabilization.     - Fringe elements become mainstream.     What Canada really needs is a two-party system like the United States.    WIth coalition governments, the position of Prime Minister is nothing more than just another job on one's resume, rather than a true position of state, like the US presidency.     Something needs to be done: A Liberal-Conservative two-party system.

WO68RZdIaa	Even though he was charged with multiple felonies for unregistered machine guns, silencers and being a felon in possession of firearms, he is getting off lightly simply because he is an artist. He could have faced up to 35 yrs in prison on federal gun charges, but he was sentenced to only 1 year and a day behind bars.    "T.I., who was born Clifford Harris Jr., plead guilty last fall to two federal weapons offenses after he was caught with unregistered machine guns and silencers. A judge sentenced him to one year plus one day behind bars and 1,000 hours of community service."    I like his music, some of it anyway, but actors, recording artists, need to be sentenced the same as the average person. Our justice system is supposed to be equal- you & I both know it isn't though- but T.I. got a slap on the wrist for serious federal gun violations. Same with the Britney & Paris Hilton incidents- neither one of them served even 1/8 or probably even 1/16 of their sentence before they were released from jail. Paris wasn't even in jail 24 hours before she was released (or was it Britney?)     Today's courts seem too afraid to hand down the appropriate sentence to someone just because they can sing or act. Sorry. but that is not how our criminal justice system was set up & it should go back to equal treatment for everyone- regardless of your status in life.    Don't worry, he has an album in the works that I believe is supposed to drop before he has to report to jail & by the time the airtime has gone away on those songs, he will be out again.|`|i5F2jwvhaa	" but I kinda feel bad for him"    Not me    I have no sympathy for criminals|`|H7ENkTxaaa	I guess I'm too old because I have absolutely no idea who  T.I. is.|`|vvJBtxXHaa	he be very happys in jell  he rite many happidty soings in hiz cell block|`|dGNoPSyjaa	Good...I hate T.I|`|56c3916305365c5f7b6879c899c6e5efaa	well jail its not a very happy place, the food its not good ,its uncomfortable they sleep for lapses,not cool at all i feel bad for him hes a good rapper|`|X6pzLsNiaa	i don't even know what your question was but  i think his situation is ******...i wonder how many year hes really facing with fed time even with good behavior you have to serve 85%|`|AA11644291	Yeah, I get somewhat irritated when they say stuff like "he faces up to 40 years in prison" or whatever just to over-emphasize it.

3734b5f7e7c27b91d0268c00d9e7ed41aa	Smokers, should have equal rights, in each and every city, and county, and state, that takes in as revenue, the taxes from the sale of tobacco products.  If a city, county or state issues laws are statutes abridging the right to light up in any place, public or private, then they should not be allowed to collect ANY revenue, from the sale of tobacco products, within their jurisdiction.  For instance (I am not a smoker, just a person that recognizes severe conflict in policy and taxation), in places like Santa Monica CA., smoking has been banned in all public places, and in the work places. Also, many people are suing in apartment complexes over the smoke from their neighbors.  If the smokers, are in violation, than each and every city, like Santa Monica, should ban ALL SALES of tobacco, in the first place.    Now?  Secondly...  If everyone knows, that second hand smoke kills, as much or more than firsthand smoke, and now cities and states are banning smoking in virtually every place....  WHY IS IT?  The the United States Of America, just doesn;t ban smoking and tobacco use ALTOGETHER?  Think about it...  If we all know tobacco kills, how come the politicians, just do not go ahead and introduce legislation to BAN TOBACCO?      HMM, yeah, let's go ahead and vilify the tobacco user.  BUT? The politicians, KNOW,  the medical profession knows,  That there is no benefit, to smoking or using tobacco..  SO WHY DON'T THEY BAN IT?  Because they ALL make money off of the sale of tobacco.  Think about it....if there were no smokers in the US?  Just how many beds, would be available in the hospitals across the US?  How much less, would the insurance companies have to pay out?  How much less suffering would there be?  Yet? The government refuses to ban smoking, and th sales of cigarettes.    SO?  Rather than focus any and ALL anger and hatred at the lonely smoker...  why not focus you collective anger, at the politicians, who seem to refuse to be willing to BAN tobacco, because they all like the revenue from the sales, better than they like the people who MIGHT DIE?  Obama Smokes?  Really?  What a shining example to our youth.|`|6cf45f1e4b4887d9df5323037a43c464aa	No rights infringed here. They have the same rights as everyone else, but not more rights.

Even if you aren't a smoker (I'm not), I know that if the government demonized smokers, it's only a matter of time before they take away what I like....whether that is a Twinkie or a can of beer etc. This is socialism. The government (the Liberals) always knows what is best for you.

I believe that a company should have the right to set standards for their employees--including that their employees be tobacco-free.  That's their choice.  My choice is what companies I want to work for.    In my field, most people smoke.  I don't know why--that's just the way that it is.  My last company brought up the concept of going tobacco-free.  It didn't go over very well since literally 80% of us in manual labor jobs smoked.  The company considered what it would cost them to lose so many experienced people in the trade and dropped the subject.  However, they did raise the health insurance premium on smokers (and I can understand that).    The government does not guarantee us that we can work for a particular company.  We have the right to smoke where it is permitted.    My problem with smoking laws is when the government comes in and tells a private business owner what lawful activities he/she can and cannot allow in their private business.  This should be up to the business owner.  Let the market decide.  Especially in bars where you need to be 21 to go in anyway.  Adults can make their own decisions whether or not they want to do business with a company that allows smoking.  If the government HAS to do anything, they can require that businesses who permit smoking must post it on their door so that people can make informed decisions about whether to go in.    The government does not guarantee us that we can eat in a particular restaurant.  We have the right to eat where ever we want.    I can understand that public buildings are smoke-free because people HAVE to go there.  However, no one HAS to go to a particular private business.    I also strongly disagree with our state law prohibiting smoking in private clubs.  In my state, if you are a member of a private, local cigar club and have a monthly meeting, you have to go outside to smoke.  The same goes for the VFW, Eagles, and American Legion.  That is just over-the-top government interference.    I agree that the government won't just stop at smokers.  They are now wanting to target people who are overweight.  This is never-ending to how much they will dictate to us what we can and can't do.  The last bill that I remember about tobacco tax is the House passing a bill that would add a dollar/pack tax on cigarettes for children's health care.  How are the two related?  Where is the government going to get the money long-term since the smoking population keeps dropping every year?  Perhaps it will be the overweight people next who have to pay.  After all, once they start this child health care we'll never be able to stop that program and someone will have to pay for it.|`|i4NkPeATaa	This is another way for government and businesses to control people. They can go after the tax paying smokers first. Next it will be people that drink followed quickly by people that are fat. As long as "the people" have to pay for health care then "the people" can demand certain standards be met and if you can not or will not meet them then you will be charged a higher fee to encourage compliance or denied treatment all together.|`|4zO1Yvjsaa	They should have rights.|`|Ng3GcFX6aa	No!

I find the policy overly invasive.|`|qgL98Wv2aa	yes...until it becomes an illegal drug no one should have the right to fire you just for smoking tobacco|`|fcc97be1ae1addc02f0b674cef5d4949aa	Why should smokers be singled out with extra rights?  The company did not infringe on their right to smoke.  They simply said that their policy was to no longer hire people that smoked.  The people have the right to choose to quit or choose to find another job.    This isn't any different than a company who has a policy prohibiting facial piercings, hair styles deemed inappropriate, or tattoos.  Companies have a right to present any image that they feel is appropriate.  The company is a health care provider.  There is nothing more ironic than seeing a group of employees standing outside the door of a hospital smoking.    NOTHINGCONSTANT:  As a conservative, I agree that the government should not be in the business of controlling people's habits.  I opposed the smoking in public places ban even though I am a non-smoker and there are places I didn't go because of the smoke.  However, I support the right of employers to set their own rules about employee conduct.|`|bQKNjFqyaa	If the President of the US can call up private companies and tell them how to spend their money, I think private citizen rights in general are soon to be a thing of the past.    However on a more relevant note, as a capitalist, a company should be able to fire someone anytime they want. Also aside from health issues smokers take more breaks and work less than non smokers, this doesn't mean that they don't make up for it in other ways but you don't see non smokers taking lollipop breaks ever 15 min do you? So in the end should they get rights? Yes, everyone is entitled to Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness, that includes the smokers and the business owners, if you are going to work for the business you have to obey the rules.|`|SgAYfsaRaa	Yeah why do you have to come here for that?|`|BhxycGViaa	thats disriminaion  them ppl have a good lawsuit  i think they will win to i smoke  ive smoked since i was 15 and im 34 now so im still here lol but thats not right though|`|ucxfU7pTaa	yes if smokers can demonstrate three good reasons to smoke. verses oh say 25 reasons not to. cigs keep away nats is the only good use i know of.|`|f63ba71f316e8a0101a83d2986ff5c54aa	I find it ammusing that the ban on smoking continues,  to descriminate against a smokers rights.

UezXqDF6aa	yes and no. People can change who they were to a whole different person. The no part comes in because of the system. It is so hard for a convicted felon to get anywhere or get a job just because it is on the record for life. That does not always mean that the person is that way anymore. They could have changed. Or for the simple fact that it could be something really small and it still haunt them for life|`|0YzP6iOTaa	Absolutely not!!

It is rather difficult, and rare, for someone who has learned to try and take shortcuts, in life, (especially the younger) to break free from the mentality, that if they can steal something, it was the owner's fault fro leaving it vulnerable to be stolen.  (applies to those who rob, rape, or whatever crime they prefer)    I know a person, who had a recurring problem with drug abuse, but eventually, this person, broke free, from the mentality, the friends, and the habits, that made his problem recurring.  So? No.  A criminal (or crook) is NOT always a crook.|`|NY0h5mY6aa	of course not! everyone can make changes in their life and attitudes if they so choose to.
3WYcPsm4aa	Ok... here goes.....  He will file his taxes with Florida, if that is his state of legal residence.  If Fl. has no state tax, he needs to keep it that way.  As an active duty military person, he can change his legal residence to any state he moves to, if he so wishes.  (Hubby changed his from HOR Missouri to Texas.  His HOR Is still MO, but legal residence is now Texas)    As for you... your legal residence is whereever you are 1. registered to vote, and 2. have a driver's lic.  And, since most states will not accept a DL from another state for military spouses, you state of residence will keep changing as he moves around.   (During our 20 years, I've been a resident of Mo, Va, Tx, and ND.)  It only gets complicated the year that you move, if you worked in 2 states.    Head to your VITA office on base... they will be more than happy to help you and explain everything to you!    Good luck!|`|AA12215630	Do not file separately, You will get a better break for filling married. That is what any tax center is going to tell you.    Next, his HOR will not change as yours won't. Now if you were stationed in Washington at any time you will have to pay state taxes since you lived in your HOR. He won't have to. If you have lived in any other state you will not have to file state taxes. They only way to file is if state taxes were taken out of your pay. For Example, my husband's HOR is NY. We have not lived in NY in many years. However, we have never changed our tax to stop NY from taking taxes out so every year we file NY state tax and get our taxes back.     Also, did you mean that he worked another job in South Carolina while in the military. IS that what you mean by he earned money there? If he did and taxes were taken out, he will have to file taxes with South Carolina.     Best Bet is to talk to the tax center or a tax place that is familiar with income tax and military members. Good luck|`|be8558170517e11de3a13500ca72ff48aa	All those people who stated that you must file state taxes in your Home of Record (HOR) are wrong! Your HOR is where you were living when you joined, with some exceptions. However, your legal residence can change, and that is where you file your state taxes.|`|9tcv3TiWaa	His HOR is Florida, while he earned money while living in South Carolina & Washington he was an employee of the Federal government so his HOR is where he pays taxes to. As it states on his LES what his home state is.    As Florida doesn't have a State Income Tax, he does not need to file a State Income Tax return.   You do not either unless you worked in another state.    You can do your taxes online for free through http://www.taxslayer.com or go through http://www.militaryonesource.com and they will direct you to another free website.  Or you can use the base VITA office and do your taxes there.  The people who volunteer at VITA are trained by the IRS the same as those who work at H&R Block, Liberty Tax, etc... but are also aware of military pay/allowances.  I have used taxslayer.com for years without a problem.|`|neuprBeGaa	A member of the military maintains their home state as their state of residence until and unless they voluntarily change it.  Unless he went to the Finance Office and changed his paperwork, he files as a resident of Florida, and you as a resident of Washington.  Neither of you owes state tax on your military pay in the other state.  You can file jointly for Federal, but will have to file Married Filing Separately for state.    If he worked a second (civilian) job during the year, he'll have to file state taxes as a non-resident for whatever state he lived in/worked in at the time.      One other note - not sure if you're military or not.  If not, then your residency changes every time you move - so any civilian income you make will have to be accounted for in the state where you earned it.  That can get complicated when you move in the middle of the year.|`|BIQrsl4paa	You are a resident of Washington. He is a resident of whatever state he claims, hopefully Florida, as they have no state income tax. I would suggest, if you are working, filing separate returns, as his income is only taxable in his home state of residency. If Washington state also has no personal income tax, your question becomes moot. South Carolina doesn't figure into the equation at all.|`|rYNM67oyaa	When you join the military you keep the home state you joined in forever or you can change to one you're stationed in. Or you can change to your spouses home state.     On the federal income tax file jointly.    I'm pretty sure you can skip filing any state taxes since he's from Florida. You can change your home of record to Florida too. No state income tax.    Don't worry about South Carolina.    The military has tax advisors available make use of them.|`|TSq9054Haa	Your home of record never changes. Wherever your husband lived when he joined the military is where they will do your state taxes. It should tell you on your W-2. My husband is in the military and we are from VA but live in NC and we pay VA state taxes. Federal doesnt matter what state you are in.|`|HhPgZDDzaa	If he is military, then he would put down what state his "home of record" is. My husband is from Iowa, but we lived in both NC and VA. Since he is military and his home of record is in Iowa, he filed state taxes through Iowa. It doesn't matter where you are stationed or how long you are there. Just file with the state that his home of record is in.|`|sdNArv1Raa	You and him are a resident of the Stat you joined in no matter what state you have PCS'ed to. It would be best if one or the other changed there Home of record to the others state so it will be easier to file in one place.     Go to H&R Block and they can help you sort it out. I have tried every tax service from the Tax place on post, On line services to H&R block. In most cases one of the Tax pro's at the closest office to the post you are in will have some one that is very familiar with Military and or is a spouse of a soldier. The Program that H&R uses in there office has a very comprehensive way of making sure you get what you deserve and has a military section. I have lived from Georgia to Missouri to Hawaii and I always clam my home of record as my state. you are exempt from State taxes in the State you are Assigned.|`|rjTU3Q9Laa	regardless of what you hear on here, do NOT file federally as married filing separately...that is a bad way to file...one person told you correctly, that your husband is a resident of fl and you are a resident of wa...file your state returns accordingly.

Our election system is broken and has been since there were no term limits set in place early in our founding. F.D.R. was elected four times and after the last time decided to have Congress pass a law that a president could serve no more than two terms. I believe it should have included all elected offices and the appointed positions also.

AA11942937	the tax cuts are nothing more than a token, just so the individuals won't be able to say they were left out.    $1000 for a couple is $83 a month.  Divide that between the working couple's two checks, each individual gets $41.50 a month tax cut.    Now seriously, can anyone tell me how this is going to help people who are struggling?  It won't even help people who aren't struggling!    and Democrats are happy with this?|`|icDCHHcsaa	1.  Make work Union type jobs (not necessarily unions) jobs will start full scale hiring crews of workers in 12-18 months not right now when we need it to perk up the economy.  I guess if you can drive a construction vehicle or pour cement you got a shot at a job this year.      2.  The Reagan Laffer tax can plan dropped the tax rate for all Americans to 22%.  The screw up was when Ronny and Tip Oneil the leader of the Senate at that time struck a dark deal.  Ronny would get a huge chunk of it to defeat Communism, and Tip got the rest to increase social spending 60%.  Since Congress wrote the checks for al these bills they should not say Ronny pulled the wool over our eyes.|`|Mhm3J5g0aa	Well, since you don' t understand it, and since there's many like you...how about basic economics 101.  People put their money into business to...guess what....Beuller...  EARN MONEY...that's right.  So you save or borrow money, you put it into a store front, create a product or service, advertise, hire employee's, etc, etc....and the free market determines who will buy...how much and at what price. That's capitalism. It doesn't always work out, its not always fair..but that's the marketplace.....Without Government interference.  It is these employee's and business owners that pay employee's, they give them raises, Christmas bonus's, reimburstments, all the little things that people can use to pay for goods and services in their own lives. The better an employer does, maybe even a mean one won't give a bonus or raise...but eventually, he will do well, he will expand and will need more people to keep up with demand...so even the most stingy will hire new people. The wheels of the economy go on.  So giving these people a tax cut will give them more liquidity to give more if not to the employee's, at least it will to the advertisement agency, to the reasearch and development, to services and goods that support the company. And many times it will go to even more employee's or raises or bonus's. That's what happens when conservative values rule the market.  But with everyone's greedy idea of trying to get "thier piece of the pie", or trying to take what they can, its equivalent to letting air out of a rolling tire.....eventually the tire goes flat and stops.  You arn't going to "save" the economy by hand outs, look at Ford...they might have been a little skewed in the business plan...but they weren't so bad that they needed the governments money, yet you check the stock exchange and you see GM stock doing better than Ford...yet GM was going under without the bail out.  The lesson ? That the bail outs are supporting the losers of our society that should...by free market principles should go bancrupt. When the government interfers with the free market they give the losers an unfair advantage for doing things wrong.  Hand outs are based in socialism, and its the undeserving that usually receive them, meanwhile good businesses might be stalled or go out of business not because they are bad, but because they can't get the credit or loans for stock or inventory.|`|eIhD4y8Waa	First ,tax cuts have been tried,not to the extent I would like to see but in every case where they have been tried they have worked.When Kennedy cut taxes the economy improved,when Reagan cut taxes the amount of money flowing into government coffers doubled,when Bush the second cut taxes the same happened.The problem is that governemnt continued to grow,spending continued to grow at astronomical rates,faster than was coming in.Whe Reagan took office the federal budget was 500 billion,when he left it was 1 trillion,when Clinton took office the federal budget was 1.5 to 2 trillion,when Bush the second left office the budget was 3.2 trillion.How can you say tax cuts don't work? Let the people who earn it keep it,save it ,spend it,thats American.How about corporate taxes? As of now we have the largest tax rate in the industrial world 35%,why do you think industries go some where else,cut the tax rates significantly and watch them flock back.Cut the capital tax rate and watch entrepenurism flourish.Taxes are in and of themselves immoral and unAMERICAN.Cut taxes + cut spending =growth and prosperity.|`|3734b5f7e7c27b91d0268c00d9e7ed41aa	Yes, a $ 500 dollar tax credit for working singles, and a $1,000 dollar credit for married people....  Meanwhile?  $44 million for repairs at the Agriculture Department headquarters in Washington.    $200 million to rehabilitate the National Mall.    $360 million for new child care centers at military bases.    $1.8 billion to repair National Park Service facilities.    $276 million to update technology at the State Department.    $500 million for the Transportation Security Administration to install bomb detectors at airports.    $600 million for General Services Administration to replace older vehicles with alternative fuel vehicles.    $2.5 billion to upgrade low-income housing.    $400 million for NASA scientists to conduct climate change research.    $426 million to construct facilities at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.    $800 million to clean up Superfund sites.    $150 million for the Coast Guard to repair or remove bridges deemed a hazard to navigation.    $6.7 billion to renovate and improve energy efficiency at federal buildings.    $400 million to replace the Social Security Administration's 30-year-old National Computer Center.    You know?  Yes, tax cuts, DO help the economy.  Look what is happening in California.  In the last year, 150,000 people, left the state.  Do you think they were ...  a. People with money, that were tired of being penalized for earning more?  or   b. People with their hands out, who enjoy the lavish rewards that Ca give to those who have lower paying jobs, more kids in the Public Schools, and pay less taxes?    I will go with 'a'.  What do you think will happen in the US  a. The rich people will stay, and just take their lumps?  b. Leave the US, and go to where they are not unfairly taxed, just because they earn more?  I would go with 'b'.  They will leave the US  NOW...  Imagine what will happen to a country, where all the people with the most capitol, leave, because they find it counter productive, to stay, in an environment, and a culture, that is increasingly punitive to the wealthy?  Hmmm, look at Mexico.|`|i5F2jwvhaa	tax cuts would have helped had it not been for the huge amount of needless pork spending in this bill    This bill will make matters worse, not better
6cf45f1e4b4887d9df5323037a43c464aa	The IP address is like the mailbox on your house. It's the only way mail can get delivered. If an IP could be blocked, you wouldn't be able to use the internet at all.    An IP address uniquely identifies a computer on the internet. Most are leased to ISPs, so that the ISP has control over giving these out to individuals. For that reason, from the IP address the police  can locate the house, office, or coffee shop that any email was sent from. They can also tell what web pages you have viewed.    An IP address just tells you the location of a computer - it doesn't tell you what is on that machine. To do that, they have to connect to your computer with some kind of software to read your hard drive. If you have a firewall, that may prevent them doing so. If you have a NAT'd router, that almost certainly would prevent them from doing so. However, mostly they just ask for a search warrant, then take the machine away and take it apart.|`|CEKZsoFRaa	They can determine your location and what you're using to access the internet.

They don't have to sleuth it from your wireless home network.    Or they can just sneak into your home when you are away at work and get it. In America there is no warrant or charges needed.    Also, if the government wants information on you, they won't need your IP address, they probably already have it.    Welcome to the New World Order.|`|kMyZEEhNaa	Your internet banking sign in and password.|`|89aNHoPnaa	everything.|`|JH2GqpA2aa	They may have access to the hard drive.

6a44deb0b64aa4a94dcb485934e01693aa	She's building a case for impeaching president nixon over the watergate scandal.  She starts by defining the reason for impeachment as laid out in the US constitution, and why it was laid out that way.  She then proceeds to indicate why the (then) current president needed to be subjected to the impeachment process.      It might help to read (parts of) the Constitution and why separation of powers/checks and balances is important.

Bay City apparently didnt have such a rule or it was not followed.    When I lived in North Carolina, the power companys bills always said something like, Please check on your neighbors when the weather is cold.  Mr. Schurs neighbors apparently didnt do that.  They must feel terrible right now.  They should.    Social services departments should have a record of all elderly people, particularly those who live alone to ensure that they are comfortable.  If you dont pay your electric bill, the utility can get a lien on your house that supersedes even the claim of a mortgage holder.  So there was no reason this should have happened.      Caplan  I read another article that said the utility put a limiter on his house and it will restrict his electricity usage but still keep the house livable.  If the electricity usage exceeds the set amount, the limiter can shut off all the electricity, which is apparently what happened here.    Booger Butt  The article says the city, not some greedy conglomerate, cut off Mr. Schurs electricity.  Apparently, Bay Citys electric plant is city-owned, so if we want to blame someone, we should blame the city.  That's not going to bring Mr. Schur back. but it might prevent future tragedies like this one.|`|whE5OQ26aa	I live 10 minutes away from Bay City.

ec55348158c3fd8764f5daba79c0af3daa	I'm not a liberal, but I don't think long-range planning is a terribly bad idea.  In fact, being a veteran of the Air Force, you probably know the Defense Budget is forecast over several decades, and military procurement and funding is programmed using this type of planning.    So it isn't terribly far-fetched.  It is possible Obama may try to get the Federal Government more involved in planning the economy, which I think would be a disaster.  What is probably needed is a return to the types of controls on securities that were established after the Crash of 1929 without a lot of federal meddling.    Democrats and Republicans have both played pretty fast and loose with the economy over the past several decades.  The result is the current train wreck.    I hope Obama isn't considering emulating Lenin in any way.  My grandparents fled Europe because of the social and economic melt-downs of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and I would hate under any conditions to flee this country.    I know you aren't really terribly serious with this question, but I gave you a serious answer.  I hope Obama is smart enough to allow market forces--given some reasonable controls--to bring this economy back.    And, I don't think Obama is stupid or subversive.  I didn't vote for him, but I'm willing to give him the benefit of the doubt for now.|`|Ikd9cppcaa	I thought that 5 year plan was Hitlers.|`|zzO6Qalsaa	already have my friend.|`|JjTinVMSaa	huh???

H2h8fnTpaa	The top 50% of tax payers pay 97% of all income tax.  All of you who think that income is the measure of wealth are mistaken.  The wealth of the government is paid for by half the nation's wage earners.  Look it up yourself. If there is ever a tax break---it needs to be for the one who actually pay taxes!|`|a0ea30926acdfeb82a6d6f9ca13bcc69aa	I personally know of several people who get thousands more back than they pay in.  In fact, I worked with a man who after paying federal tax for two months, would go to HR and have them stop taking federal taxes out of his check (yes, you can do this).  Then at the end of the year, he'd file and still receive thousands back.  He did not pay taxes and he was honest enough to admit it.  EITC was a major money-maker for him.    You obviously don't believe this but my mother-in-law has a business filing taxes.  It happens frequently with low income people.|`|2a48fdc514a71a7ec08cb137b00a0443aa	They might have income tax deducted from their pay check, but annual income less then 12,000 for a single gets a refund.    And most claim the EIC (earned income credit) for some kind of dependent either legal or illegal and get thousands back even if they paid $0 in income taxes.|`|9npIzlHKaa	Bingo!|`|026463f641c91751757ddeacfc3bac71aa	40% of the american population doesn't pay any income tax.  if it comes out of there checks they get it back in social services.  it's not case by case but it is the average.  you don't think all those food stamps and government homes are free do you?|`|O1jigUYSaa	Actually, you're wrong.  If you make less than $3500, you're not required to even file a tax return...unless you had taxes with held...you'll get everything back.  You can also get earned income credit even if you have no children (and are not a dependent),  You get more money back than you ever put in.  Low wage earners do not pay taxes.  They get refunds.

The Democrats have been blind from the beginning.|`|uFTO5rs8aa	No.  They will continue with less taxes for the wealthy and more war spending to fund the military-industrial complex.  They don't want less government, they want less government on THEM and MORE government for those who don't agree with them.      Republicans are certainly NOT true conservatives, you can try the Libertarian party.|`|diCASlUXaa	Maybe.........    we're talking at least 16 years down the road.    They will have their chance to prove themselves and we'll find out.|`|AA11148986	I hope so.    16 years seems like a long time for them to learn that lesson.|`|aTAUOI8caa	In fairness, they held that until they had power.  Now that it is taken away from them again, they have gone back to it.    They care about less government only when they are not that big a part of government.  They only care about less spending when it is Democrats who have control of the money; and they go right back to spending when they themselves have control of the money.      Republicans are great as long as they stay out of power.  Which is rather unfortunate.  They have great ideas, but you let them in power and they ignore those ideas.      Democrats have stupid ideas, but give them power and they follow the great ideas of Conservatism.            Does either party really make sense to you?  I'd rather have Democrats in because they are more Conservative when in power, and Republicans keep them in check in case they forget.  Both parties are better off when Democrats are in power.|`|diDclflkaa	Does anybody really believe that either party is for less government? We have a single party system with 2 party rhetoric at election time. What has really changed in the last 16 yrs?? (Clinton followed by Bush) Aside from things getting worse for the average American.    Sorry, I just think we need to get back to following the constitution!|`|eIhD4y8Waa	No.Republicans over history have preached limited government,but when was the last time Republicans have cut anything? They talked the talk but never walked the walk.Yes there have been some in Congress who have,Ron Paul for example but they are few.So the answer is no and history is my source.We are going insane in this country,we keep doing the same things over and over expecting a different result.|`|RsenWiWfaa	Question of the Century, my friend.

In the meantime, I believe oscillating left to right is the correct course, and we've gone too far in the past 8 years to the free-market side.

Don't misunderstand me, I beleive a CEO should be paid hansomely, but 2,000 times more than the average?  Maybe, oh, 1,000 times is enough?    I have no problem at this time moving from the far right back to center or center-left to fix things.  And then back to the right again.    To me, there is no perfect point between left-right leaning politics...the answer is changing that point as the "times" require.|`|70DZWz2Baa	I sure hope so because I am sick of being in exile.

Just realize that then you'll have to pay for the new attorney to catch up, since that new attorney would pretty much be starting from scratch.    You may want to consider a newer attorney who may work for a reduced rate to get some experience.  Call any local law schools and ask if they have a list of graduates from the last couple of years who may be practicing family law.    Good luck.

It will do little to actually stimulate the economy and less than 1/4 of it goes to actually "creating" jobs.  It is full of things like new cars for govt. employees, re-sodding the national mall, millions for National Endowment for the Arts and ACORN.  It is being sold as an economic stimulus plan.  It is not.  That is why Republicans are not in favor of it.

Not counting those, spending did NOT, in fact, go up under Bush's budgets. Further, if you separate out the budget votes by party you find the budget SHRANK if you count GOP votes only and quadrupled if you count DNC votes only.  Obama has done the opposite. I realize that for you that's almost the same thing, but seriously? Not so much.  Obama's plan features NO tax-cuts. It does feature large tax rate increases for EVERY bracket (which he amusingly calls tax cuts) and hand-outs to non-taxpayers which he also calls tax cuts.  The increased spending is real. Again, NOT counting SS and Medicare, Obama has announced about 3 times the spending we did last year.  So, in REALITY:  - Republicans are for cutting taxes (actual tax rate reductions) and Obama refuses to allow it.  - They are NOT for increasing spending and Obama demands a world-record shattering amount of it.  They're being 100% consistent and YOU think that's nuts.  I have some bad diagnostic news for you . . . .

Alabama Arizona Colorado Florida Georgia Illinois Indiana Kansas Maryland Massachusetts Michigan Minnesota Mississippi Missouri Montana North Carolina Oklahoma Rhode Island South Carolina Tennessee Utah Virginia    I have heard of someone suing a woman for breaking up her marriage and winning. This was not too long ago.    As far as my argument for:  When getting married, you are swearing before God to forsake all others for your spouse. If you do not mean it don't get married.|`|7BJ0YScwaa	Many countries including S.Korea and Turkey give short prison sentences for adultery.  The question is why not give prison sentences? Only people who cheat go to jail, so if you argue against it you must be wanting to cheat / cheating. Those countries I mentioned have no prison sentences for sex before marriage, so if you want to sleep around then don't get married.   It has been proven that children of broken homes commit more crime and are less healthy etc... so if you're going to contribute to that because you can't keep it in your pants that should be considered a crime.
QP7VyPV6aa	Well first off the courthouse doesn't get the money it goes through a state disbursement unit. Secondly how are they overpaying her? Is it being withheld from his check?  If so he should go to the courthouse and get a copy of the withholding order to verify that there is not a clerical error in the amounts. If there is not he needs to get with hour at his job and see what they are doing.   Most of the time overpayments made directly to the agency can be corrected by giving him credit on future payments. If they went through the atty gen he should be able to get it corrected failry easily, although he may need his atty to contact them to get it resolved|`|LYPWNxx5aa	He needs to get a lawyer immediately.

In California, the system is setup to take up to two months of overpayment (basically someone can pay up to two months in advance and the system will start refunding ONLY if there are three or more months overpayment).  That's with every case.    You didn't say how much the over payment was.  If it's a month or two, there's not much he can do about it but really, with automated systems, most child support agencies are setup to take multiple months of child support in advance.    What he can do is make sure they are not taking out more than his current support every month but with most people and depending on his pay periods, there is one or two extra checks every year.  NOTHING he can do about that.|`|OAyXEtIoaa	you NEED a lawyer to be involved in this. unfortunately, they are the ones that know the ropes, and will get the attention he needs from other legal bodies. he will get nowhere without it.

meVH73dOaa	There is a lot or Pork, as usual and the democrats have it hid in that package, and the greedy money grabbers will do or say any thing to get their hands on it. The dems have a whole lot of favors slipped  in the package, that is the way they back for donors to their campaign, especially a lot of huge illegal ones under the table.  Yes it is socialism, and it is going to get worse, worse and worse.      The radical agenda will continue as they try to sneak things past. One day we will wake up and it will all be in place and we will be asking; How? It starts when they begin eroding our rights and it ends with us under one collective government where we are ruled by a few elitists. They do it by inserting things like money for universal health care into a stimulus package. They will continue until one day we wake up and all our health care decisions are made by government and paid for by the taxpayer. Again, we will ask; How?    By 2010 we will have one of two courses. Obama and the libs will have taken control of our lives and removed any chance of resistance or their acts will cause such a backlash that they lose a great number of seats in the midterm election.    Keep and eye on this. Anyone who votes for the bailout and other items designed to take our freedoms away needs to be removed from office.|`|SlhuFfuZaa	Taking in the theory that if the country gets itself in too deep that it has to declare itself bankrupt and our present government is thereby nullified, creating a void, much like Iceland is in at the present moment. This gives the opposition the opportunity to step in and reprieve our nation, and if it be their will, make us a socialist nation, destroy the Constitution and all freedoms with or without the people's permission. They may, if wanted reinstall our present government but with certain stipulations that they have power to seat their choice as head of state, doing so in secret and oblivious to public knowledge.  This is how it is laid out in the plan according to the Rothschild plan of world domination through monetary control, a World Bank system, such as the Federal Reserve, which is not a government agency, but a privately owned bank and a part of the World Bank.   Since they have controlled our money since 1913 and have taken away the Congressional right to print and coin our money, they have in all ways already replaced our government and do control it through our monetary system.   They want a North American Union, under a socialist lead, and this stimulus deal may just break the government, leading to this full take over.   Look for change in mid 2009 as a start of things to come. Our way of life is in jeopardy!|`|a0ea30926acdfeb82a6d6f9ca13bcc69aa	It's a giant leap towards socialism.  This debt will be crippling to our children and grandchildren.  The younger generations already know that they'll owe the government a lot of money.  A crippled nation is an easy target for take-over whether from within or without.    What's worse than this "stimulus" package is the fact that so many people WANT to give up their individual freedoms and have the government take care of things for them.  It's going to happen eventually since that's what our young people think they want.  It's only a matter of time taking one step at a time to get there.    Most of the things in this "stimulus" package don't even stimulate the economy.  It won't encourage private businesses to hire employees or urge people to start new businesses.  It will only add to the government payroll with is already the largest payroll in the nation.  We need something to stimulate our economy NOW yet the items in the stimulus package fail to do that.  Having the federal government get larger does not improve private businesses.|`|HZy629kLaa	No. The road you drove on today is socialism.  Just like the FHA or GI Bill mortgage that your parents or great grandparents took out.|`|9qJPfpRpaa	Don't kid yourself. The Republicans' vote on this measure was purely political.

Obama does not need republican votes to pass his package, but he does need republican support.    This is because, if his plan fails he can say that republicans supported his bailouts and not take heat for it. So the best thing republicans can do is VOTE NO.    His plan is pure Marxism, or in other words spreading the wealth. Trickle up working is a giant myth.|`|VfBaveaJaa	yes we are getting there one step at a time. they control the laws, the money, the value of the dollar, employment, now business's which would be wall street, what else is there our freedom is out the window and has been for a long time. the gov't knows more about us than we do.. and their memory lasts longer|`|AA10466438	Does it matter?

And he is not a citizen of the US.  It is totally fair to prevent him from reentering the US.  Stop whining, and above all, stop lying.

Talk to an attorney, or contact your local senator/congressperson.|`|6iI4xhFbaa	I'm going through precisely the same thing right now, and for the same reason.  I encourage you to contact me through my profile.  I have absolutely accurate information about the process.|`|7OpFE5zAaa	IBU GURU, be quiet! First off you may contribute a lot but that does not make you smart! The country of Mexico does not require an immigration process for us as U.S. citizens to relocate there, apparently you did not know this and talked before you learned. Get a life and quit sitting on Yahoo all day giving knowledgeless  answers just for something to do!   Anyway, fair or not fair??? I don't like to decide anyones fate but my own. I do however recommend you get a good lawyer, check out www.lawyers.com and you can look for immigration lawyers right in your area. Iowa City Iowa has an attorney by the name of Dan Vondra who is especially good in the field of immigration and a lot of immigration filings can be done without ever going to the lawyers office.   You need to appeal your initial case and ask why he was denied, go to Ciudad Juarez if needed as this is the location in which all those decisions are made. Secondly realize that even when he is allowed to re-enter the States he will be barred for an undetermined amount of time. My opinion is that he will be allowed back in but after you appeal the first case. Keep excellent track of birth dates and all other vital info as you do not want any simple mistakes to slow down your process. Once his application is submitted (I130) and accepted you can normally expect (at this time) a wait of about six months to a year in Mexico. I hope this helps you and I certainly would not give up.   Remember one thing people, we are a country of immigrants. I do realize in current times we have a process to go through but at the end of the day we are all immigrants from somewhere other than the U.S. Good Luck!!!|`|kNscpF4Faa	Sometimes when someone is charged with coming illegally they are black listed and cant come back into states even for visit for an average of 5 years.|`|VDg4R7SIaa	I'm sorry about your husband.

There are so many that are going through all kinds of unnecessary problems because of the mixed up policies. For instance,there are spouses who have disabilities and can't get along without the financial support of their husband or wife, so are forced to rely heavily on social services. Then there are children who have had the supporting parent sent away, so they are then made dependent on tax payer money.Then there are those who are sent back to their country of origin and live there in a dangerous situation,what if it's an elderly person or a woman alone? Breaking up a family or married couple is a wrong, a "crime" that has no man made law written against it. The government hurts it's own citizens and itself, because of their callous, mistaken viewpoint and mismanagement. The fact that a foreign born person has no crime convictions, pays their taxes, hurts no one, and wants to apply for papers should count for something. There are many citizens that break all kinds of laws and don't get taken away from their families. I'm talking about breaking the kind of laws that protect others, such as stealing, deception in the workplace, fraud, speeding, or hit and run or drunk driving, and what about the government officials who commit fraud and crimes themselves, what??;  just some examples. There are many more. * The thumbs down must agree then that families should be broken up for no good reason, children without the other parent, and dependents should have to live on the taxpayer's money? What good is accomplished by that? Don't forget that your great grand parents, or whatever, were immigrants too, and you wouldn't be here if it weren't for them.

When two forces are in a struggle for control of a country.....both are mercenary armies until one side wins then their troops become a legal army .....the other side is the illegal mercenary???    What is legal and illegal depends on who is adjudicating.....who has power......   I had a friend hired to fight in Chad.....if his side had won he would have been a national "freedom fighter"......as it was his side lost so he was put against a wall and shot as a mercenary    We had "mercenaries" in the American Army during the Revolution ( Von Steuben; La Fayette etc).....as did the British     LEGAL ??.....ILLEGAL ??? depends|`|ef3fc1e0570c393f59a51592deb338e5aa	Here is Article 47 of the Protocol Additional of the Geneva Convention.  It was adopted in June 1977 and went into effect December 7th 1979.  It states:    Article 47.-Mercenaries  1. A mercenary shall not have the right to be a combatant or a prisoner of war.    2. A mercenary is any person who:    (a) Is specially recruited locally or abroad in order to fight in an armed conflict;    (b) Does, in fact, take a direct part in the hostilities;    (c) Is motivated to take part in the hostilities essentially by the desire for private gain and, in fact, is promised, by or on behalf of a Party to the conflict, material compensation substantially in excess of that promised or paid to combatants of similar ranks and functions in the armed forces of that Party;    (d) Is neither a national of a Party to the conflict nor a resident of territory controlled by a Party to the conflict;    (e) Is not a member of the armed forces of a Party to the conflict; and    (f) Has not been sent by a State which is not a Party to the conflict on official duty as a member of its armed forces.     Now, first off let's clarify a few misconceptions that many people seem to hold near and dear.    Blackwater is NOT a mercenary organization.  The distinction from a legal standpoint is an important one.  Blackwater is not hired to engage in and in fact does not engage in military actions.  They are hired to provide site and personal security by the US State Department.  This does not mean that Blackwater operatives do not carry weapons, do not engage in firefights, and do not shoot people.  They do all of those things but only in the execution of their security duties.  They do not patrol the Hot Zones and they do not engage in aggressor operations.  They are there to protect their principles.  As long as their principle does not get shot at - they don't get to do any shooting even if they see a car full of insurgents rolling down the road.  That is the whole basis of the case against the five Blackwater guards who were involved in the shooting back in 09/2007.  The prosecution alleges they were not under fire and the defense alleges they were.    Blackwater is more properly referred to as a PMC or Private Military Contractor.  These companies are contracted to provide security and/or specialized military training or logistic services.  Certainly these companies provide military expertise and have access to military equipment but again they are very limited in what they can actually do.    Another misconception is the French Foreign Legion.  Nope, not mercenaries either.  The FFL is incorporated into and a part of the French national military.  So they are not legally mercenaries either.  They are legal combatants and are protected under the Geneva Convention.|`|RfxQJU4Xaa	Yes, look up blackwater. Badass man

I lovemyfamily- if you think he did a good job, you arent paying attention.|`|E9XL5x3Paa	Bush cut taxes to businesses as part of Reaganomics.    This is a severe oversimplification of the theory, but it works for our purposes.  The idea is if you give money to business owners, they will use it to make money.  In other words, they will use it to expand old businesses and create new ones.  And since you need people to run those businesses, that meant a whole bunch of new jobs.    It is a beautiful theory on paper, but fails in actual practice.    What happened is that those business owners did create new businesses and expand old ones.  The problem lies in how.  They did it by automating those jobs out of existence.    They started replacing us with computers and robots.  All that money went to the profit line of businesses, and that meant an immediate boost in investments from investors.  That is why the Stock Market was shooting so high back in 2005 and 2006.    But as Malcolm Equis said, employees are also customers.  As they were being replaced by automation, they didn't have jobs to fund their spending.  So while businesses initially made huge amounts of money saving so much on payroll, it eventually came back to bite them when their customers didn't have any money to buy from them.    Then even businesses who had done right with the money were losing customers.  Even when they provided some jobs, their customers were out of a job and could not afford to buy from them either.  So eventually their profit line dropped and they had to let go of employees as well.    Finally, with the profit lines dropping and jobs disappearing, the investors began to really worry and run for their proverbial economic lives.  They all of a sudden quit investing, and began taking any investments already in the Stock Market back out.  That is what we are seeing now.      Reaganomics worked at one time.  But that was back in the 80's when technology still had not advanced to the point where it could replace us.  It could make businesses greatly more efficient, but businesses still needed workers.    But that day is now about done.  Technology is advancing to the point where it is making the worker obsolete.  We can't keep up with what is replacing us.  Businesses know it, and so go with the most cost-efficient thing they can, which is technology like robots and computers.    But that means too many customers (who were employees) lose their jobs and can't buy anymore.  Businesses have not made that connection in their minds yet.  They see more efficiency, less cost, but don't see lost customers and so they don't understand how they are undercutting themselves by trying to cut payroll.      Bush tried to do good, but he is working with an outdated theory.  Reaganomics, while once good, is now a dangerous idea.|`|ioCiw5zlaa	He NEVER vetoed a single spending bill until Dems took control of the house and senate.

Mr. Bush relaxed standards at the SEC regulating the behavior and monitoring of investment houses.  He did the same at the FDIC with oversight of banks.    Mr. Bush awarded no bid contracts to a number of strategically placed corporations, not only in Iraq, but in the United States as well.    Mr. Bush spent over 600 billion dollars, outside of the normal budgetary outlays to the Department of Defense, on the war in Iraq.    Mr. Bush provided financial incentives to automobile manufacturers to produce larger and less fuel efficient vehicles.    Mr. Bush altered the taxation for capital gains, both reducing revenues and enriching the richest Americans.    Mr. Bush eliminated the inheritance tax.    Mr. Bush put in place fiscal policies that favored American corporations investing their operations overseas (especially Mexico and China) and in the Marianas.    Shall I go on?    Cheers.|`|c3be98a378a7f478cc0867a107078db7aa	not a .... ..... thing.  you can thank the clintonistas and the pelosi/reid regime for that.|`|aTAUOI8caa	That would be the Iraq War.      Bush wanted to fight this war, but not raise the funds (raise taxes) to actually pay for it.  He had to pay for it, so how did he?  Well, he borrowed the money from other countries.  And they were willing to let him have it, but at kind of a high interest rate.    What did that matter to Bush?  This war was going to be over in 6 months anyway, so let's do it, right?    Only problem is, it was not over in 6 months.  We are now about to enter our 6th year there, well past the 6 months envisioned by Bush.  But he still refused to raise the funds for it.  So he had to go back and borrow more and more from the other countries.    And they were still willing to let him have it.  But as he kept borrowing, they began to grow concerned that we could not pay back our debts.  They were still willing to take the chance, but they wanted to charge even higher in interest rates to account for the risk.  What choice did Bush have?  He had committed himself to the war and to low taxes, so he took it.    Consider that Bush was the QUINTESSENTIAL Reagan Republican.  He cut all taxes, and he cut all spending except that on National "Defense" (because this can't really be called a defensive war, now can it?).  Yet he spent so much on the war (war operations plus interest) that he turned the $4 trillion National Debt he inherited from Bill Clinton into $11 trillion.    In 8 years, Bush managed to spend $3 trillion MORE THAN DOUBLE all 42 of his predecessors COMBINED; and they needed 224 years to amass their debt.     Such a meteoric rise in the National Debt frightened investors, who then backed away from investing in the dollar.  That sent the dollar's value way down.  It's currently at its 16 year low, and still falling.  And since the currency is the backbone of a Capitalist economy, when the dollar faltered the economy fell right behind it.      Businesses had to use more dollars to make the same products.  Oil is also measured in dollars, so a lower value for the dollar meant that it took more to equal the same barrel of oil.  That raised shipping costs, which combined with just more expensive products meant huge rises in costs at stores.    It also meant that businesses were going to have to cut expenses, and the biggest one they cut was payroll.  In other words, they laid off employees.  But employees are also customers for businesses, so when they were laid off and were facing significantly higher prices at stores, they had to cut their spending.  There's your problem with Middle Class spending, the biggest driver of our economy.    This meant a drop in sales for businesses, which meant more layoffs.  It also meant a significantly smaller profit line.  Now if you were an investor, would you invest in a company barely making a profit?  How about one making an out-and-out loss?  There's your problem in the Stock Market.    Employees are also bank lendees.  So with the loss of their jobs and the loss of their savings in the Stock Market (401k, investments, etc.), they all started defaulting on their home loans, mortgages, and car loans.  There's your problem in the financial sector, the real estate market, the subprime mortgage mess, and the auto industry.    Which of course led to fear in investors again, and further losses in the Stock Market.        Every economic problem we have was either caused or exascerbated by the falling value of the dollar.  That can be traced back to the National Debt, which in turn can be traced back to the Iraq War.

IwBIM1tVaa	Let me preface my answer with a comment I can't stand the fool but it was a joke.|`|q4EXFhV7aa	How pathetic do you have to be to  post this crap?    Obviously it was a joke. Did you bother to read the article and watch the video?? He was CLEARLY joking.|`|Ikd9cppcaa	Yes, Obama will be deciding everything about your life. Eventually, the government will tell you how much and what you can eat, how much you should weigh, where you can work and how much you will be paid.|`|mZi7R0Enaa	Once again he shows his damn audacity ...who the hell does he think he is anyway? Gawd he continues to be more of an *idiot* all the time!|`|Zp93fab3aa	He was just joking.  If you live in Chicago (like I do) you know what he is talking about.    The schools never shut down for snow here.    Get a sense of humor.|`|eu6UQElYaa	Well, according to Obama children are such a burden.  I guess he figures if you missed the boat aborting them then you can always just hope sending them out on icy roads will do them in.|`|lRmhwiYpaa	Yes, Obama should have at least thought that Washington DC may not be prepared for the winter ice storms like Chicago     Chicago is a nasty city~the only good part is the part downtown around the Miracle Mile and the Navy Pier.~~ and a few Museums  but  the suburbs are not *MY kind of town*|`|cQDAt46waa	Obama wishes to change the country's name United Sates Of Socialistic America: USSA|`|i4NkPeATaa	I think Obama meant it as a gentle joke. maybe someone needs to tell the new President that little jokes like that carry bigger meaning then he may want and you can drive on snow but you can't drive on ice.|`|MBqoeaEJaa	nice sarcasm.. but it was just a simple statement...of course america has too many whiners like you....and when someone has the potential to do something you slam them down...AND if you have been watching the news instead of criticizing the president you would know that he has been very busy talking care of the ecnonomy and passing a stimulus package...|`|7y6yfrQlaa	no, he wasn't upset; he made a joke about it, relax!|`|f7KKrMJvaa	Oh c'mon     Don't you remember those days long ago when you would listen closely to the radio to hear the if your school was closed.    Sitting there while they go through the long list and when they finally announced your school a rush of excitement runs through you.    Man that brings me back.|`|3TjiJls7aa	I loved his comments! I love to hear him sincerely talking about his children.|`|8zOdKD7Qaa	He just thinks he is all that and needs his ego burst a little|`|AA11620976	He's actually onto something good here   Just think of how much money on health-care and related costs the American taxpayer would save if all American children walked to school in all weather .Face it: Fat kids are an expensive luxury that we can no longer afford .  Btw The real reason for snow -days is not because kids can't get to school But rather  because teachers can't get to school|`|6iI4xhFbaa	I do not support Obama politically.  However, he was joking around with reporters.  I don't find any problem with his comments, especially when you watch the video.|`|EGWzEwizaa	I am with you all the way.  He is the savior so couldn't he just make it not snow any more?|`|782a6f6Aaa	oh shut up. it was a JOKE.  people make those sometimes.|`|DramWx7Qaa	WOW A POLITICIAN TALKING ABOUT THE WEATHER.....    BS Is what he was born to do.......    Seriously, if it lightened the atmosphere a little, a little small talk can go a long way. He has to win their hearts, and their minds.|`|3M3UtNyvaa	Well, after reading your incoherent rant, I will have to agree that something needs to be done about our nation's schools or lack thereof.    Am I to assume that you took all of Bush's jokes so seriously as well? Wow, you must be a lot of fun to hang out with....not.|`|HZy629kLaa	Look, I'm from Chicago.  When Chicago cancels school for weather they got some serious stuff going on, like, aside from Minnesota, Buffalo, and the rest of the upper midwest, Colorado - you'd all rather die than send your kids to school in what Chicagoans send their kids to school in...And employers kinda get ticked when you have to take a snow day for your kids...    Everyone who has ever lived somewhere with real winter weather and moved somewhere else would have been pissed to.    Did you really need to make - literally - a federal case out of it?      Sheesh!|`|R9Iy1ERUaa	How many more hours of this administration?  I am so sick of it already!|`|KiLGNvLeaa	He was joking|`|AA11148986	Wow, you must really love the Kool-Aid Rush has been passing out.    Can't you take a joke?|`|ZTwZJjj7aa	Is he even allowed to make such changes to the school system? That's dealt with on a local/state level... Although as the President, he has a great deal of political and monetary influence. He's supposed to be dealing with national issues- you know the ones he promised to deal with? (I have no idea what he's doing other than making these statements, so correct me if I'm wrong in my assumption that he isn't fullfilling his campaign promises)   I'm glad President Obama has decided to threaten the DC area's snow days as opposed to focusing on the issues that threaten the entire nation. He really appears to have his priorities in line.  Bottom line: Tweaking the DC area's school systems is not in Obama's job description.
bt8c16pYaa	It's possible, but I have a feeling that the historians will judge his success / failure on the future stability of Iraq and Afghanistan.|`|2qQPBDlkaa	some will others will always be blinded by hate|`|0dDT8Hgdaa	hell no|`|3DOQG6hEaa	Quite the opposite, even if the Democrats in power don't have the guts to investigate Bush, he at the very least will be investigated privately and by historians, and history will not be kind to him in the slightest.|`|kF4JixDFaa	With hindsight we often see political reigns differently years later. President Reagan for example did a lot of shameful things, but even though he was a crusty old conservative grouch, he still had the vision to forge peace with the Soviets. His conservative cronies at the time would have been against this, but showed himself to be a man of vision.  George Bush Jnr? Well I think he has low intelligence, and is not honest or honourable so what good was there? Reagan on the other hand also was not real intelligent, but was shown to be basically a man with some honour and integrity.  So I would say, no, George W Bush will be seen in the future to be not a good President.|`|AA11148986	No. Presidential historians and polls have pretty much said that the Bush presidency will likely be considered a failure.|`|vdpKJkGuaa	I think we should realize that there were probably specific reasons why he made the decisions he did...with the information he had.  All the media does is just decide on an image they want to portray and run w/ it.    Yep, years from now, we'll have more information as to why things happened the way they did.    All I can say is, we weren't bombed after 9/11 thanks to the measures taken to ensure that.    I'm glad he's back here in Texas, right in Dallas!|`|PDRS7YT3aa	Lets think about this:  The "stupid" liberals left the country with a budget surplus.  Unemployment was low.  We were in a market boon.    We were not engaged in any wars.    The conservatives  left the country with a huge budget deficit,  Unemployment is very high, Large companies are going out of business.  The market is scary.  We are engaged in an unwinable war based on bad intelligence and misinformation. Not only have the best of our young men and women died and suffered as a result, but our standing in the rest of the world is tarnished.    We engaged in war crimes for God's sake.    The oil companies made record profits while you and I suffered at the pumps.  Bush and Cheney are oil-rich.    He appointed his friends to key positions who were incompetent instead of the most qualified people available which resulted in our failures in New Orleans.  He was a bad president and a bad man.|`|AA10124897	I think it's happening already... Of course those of us who understand how things work, already know that.|`|c2dfad4dc1f663f9f98d8667a84e7f6daa	No. More truths will come out and he will be disliked even more.|`|ff4620d7ef5c56f9405c2f52615552f5aa	The media probably didn't even tell us half of all the atrocities the Bush administration were up to. They should be in prison right now for their war crimes.|`|MEReSvZeaa	Conservatives know the score right now.    Liberals are the only ones who are several decades behind the learning curve.|`|70DZWz2Baa	By then people won't care to much. Oh well. At least now they can't shoot the goat because he is their messiah. Plus kahn is so right.|`|JthubNIsaa	It takes 15 years to open the archives. That's when the info can be revealed.|`|A6Xjzhdaaa	no way|`|de711i5Vaa	Smart people know it now, only liberal idiot loons think otherwise.|`|i5F2jwvhaa	yes they will|`|DlQd0m0Daa	Yes, there was a campaign to destroy him by the democrats and they used the media to do it. It was underhanded and seditious, I for one want an investigation into it.|`|61315c556c8efa34d1991d342fa8b948aa	I think it won't belong before we realize he is a lot worse than we think!   Republicans have been crying that its the Medias fault since Reagan.   When are they going to stop being cry-babies and take responsiblity for their failures!|`|AA11972175	The Media has always tell the people what the Media wants the people to hear.  it doesn't matter what the TRUTH is|`|5b85793bae21d013c789850655fa694caa	I think once the smoke clears and his legacy is examined he will have been found to be the one man whose policies were almost responsible for the downfall of our country.  Its not the media, if anything they came late to the facts, and gave him a pass in the name of patriotism, in fact they should have been on top of his actions earlier, and with less fascination with terror as an excuse to gut the constitution for his own benefit.  Historians, not the media will have the last word, and they will not be kind.|`|b21fc34917b458cf7b37456bede7feb9aa	Yup...he was much worse!|`|RtHq6y78aa	YES    And with the way Obama is going it will be sooner rather than later.|`|8OaAmwq8aa	If the truth is told we will find he was even worse.|`|9Nx0MPaeaa	Never he was just that bad, or I won't live that long to see it.  Thanks for asking.|`|3eea4704cf8414e46d6ef6d3729ba82baa	No, we'll be looking down upon Bush for many years to come.|`|KztKQSoXaa	Yes, and the only negative thing that will be remembered about him is that he opened the door for someone like Obama to come in!
HRAqdnGfaa	i believe some kind of stimulus package is necessary, but there is a lot of useless pork barrel spending within this one.  Take for instance $134 million to hospices or the up to $3 billion for native americans, obviosly not the essentials that we need to be spending our money on when our debt is about 10 trillion and mostly in the hands of the chinese, who are having no problem manipulating currencies.|`|4zijn0cgaa	baffled no, Pi$$ed yes|`|U0Rvsabdaa	Yes. As if trillions of dollars in spending won't require tax increases? Besides, you can't buy your way out of the problem.|`|AA11942937	no couple is going to feel more secure with their $83 a month cut of the stimulus package.    It's laughable how obammy has padded the paws of his money backers|`|c3be98a378a7f478cc0867a107078db7aa	im not, as thats what liberals do.   we as republicans warned you of obamas socialism ahead of time.|`|meVH73dOaa	I am not surprised at all, democrats are known as "tax and spend" in Washington and they are the majority, so we are totally scre*ed. I did not vote for him because I had his far left liberal agenda figured out after the first debate. He lied, and intends on making bigger government, that is what all the bail outs is about. I can guarantee that when the Bush's tax cuts run out next year, our taxes are going to sky Rocket, to pay for that insane spending in the the stimulus bill. And there is ton's of Pork in there too, things the public will never know about, until it is to late. More government control over our life's. Bad for America. Keep a check and note all the ones that voted for the stimulus bill, and vote them out in mid term elections. That is the only way we can fight back and be effective.|`|YF1To4SGaa	Yep, the socialists are right at the door. Your freedom is at stake.|`|587533eca4604b2d23fa382dc6204d59aa	Baffled? No, I knew Democrats won the election.  Why not take the $825 billion and give it to the people? Because that wouldn't hurt the economy as badly. They don't want to improve it. All you need to do is listen to them speak in a small venue. They know most voters get their "reality" from network TV so in other places, they speak openly about their plans. They INTEND to hurt the economy. That makes people more agreeable to putting government in charge of everything.|`|JURZ9YvXaa	this finanical time will take more than just a check
ayhDyb16aa	Why is it these so called stimulus plans stimulate government and special intrests groups but do little to stimulate your personal world and  economy ?|`|AA10382849	It doesn't it just a bunch of pork wrapped up in a pretty package. Those that are getting the money, just about every liberal junket you can think of, will be smiling.|`|VIK4jt0Oaa	Well, the mess is with these stupid mortgage securities that are all bundled up and made confusing. Banks traded these things and are now left holding the bag. Unfortunately many of these securities are based on these unregulated mortgages that were given out. The last bailout was steered by the GOP to make CEO's richer. All that "market meltdown" was a scare tactic (commonly used by the previous administration) to push the TARP bailout.     This bailout will be a bit different. It will focus on funding scientific projects which will pave the way for new (hopefully greener) markets. This is out many of our technologies came from today (e.g. cell phones, Internet, digital communications). For example, if Obama does give the auto industries more of our tax dollars; he's going to request better mileage cars (or even electric cars) be made and sold to the public to a quota. He will also make it easier to get tax credits if you have solar panels on your house and cleaner technologies of that sort. This is the part Republicans hate. Republicans also hate giving the American working class a direct bailout because they simply represent the super wealthy.       Realistically we seem to have forgotten the U.S. economy is based on trading mortgage securities on Wall Street. The last administration had no oversight and even deregulated some of the laws in place to make sure this didn't get abused. It started with Reagan and Bush slam dunked de-regulation. Mortgages were being given out like $2 LCD's. Now many of them are worthless because they were given to people who fraudulently applied for them.    Sorry for tangenting a bit.|`|YTJ5Upneaa	It doesn't, this bill is a joke! It only allows 40 million in tax cuts for small businesses. Think about it if Obama is so for small businesses wouldn't he give them a better tax break, they in turn would be able to hire more employees, unemployment goes down, people start buying things again.   No instead he wants to use the money for short term jobs that have no real staying power. Some is just plain old pork, which does absolutely NOTHING for the economy, but does pay for government pet projects.The rest is earmarked for groups such as acorn, which is under investigation for voter registration fraud. (Helping the democrats)   Americans NEED to stand up and demand better, from these people.|`|0683ccd6412eda6bd75ac2f24a0c357aaa	It doesn't help us at all. But, it does solidify power for the liberal socialist left.|`|jyzpX5iuaa	Divers do it deeper   &  Dems do it dumber    Can we get photos of them drooling on there stimulate themselves bill.  I can see Nancy rubbing it against her saggy thigh saying oh oh oh we just scammed america.|`|MVLnWyTraa	It is going to help Al Gore the most, he is getting 400 million, you should have seen the big grin on his face!  60% of the other money is going to special interest.....  stuff which Pelosi likes, and we pay for    Probably a million going for Pelosi's face lift, it is going to cost that much to repair the Dame!|`|AA10124897	It doesn't.... that's why when it doesn't work it will be yet another notch on the failure of the current administration.

After all, did Iran apologize for taking our hostages at the embassy back in the Carter administration ?  Did they want to apologize yet for the marine Barricks they blew up in 1983 ?...yes...they were responsible for that.  Did they apologize yet for the support they were giving Iraqie insurgents during the Iraq war ? or for taking in weapons that the inspection teams weren't suppose to find by letting them cross from Iraq to Iran ?  Just when are they going to apologize ?|`|qokHeqCSaa	i really agree with this. the U.S. has gotten involved in so many foreign affairs without any right to do so, and we have hurt so many foreign governements, and individuals. i personally think the U.S owes the entire world an apology. if we weren't constnaly attacking, bombing, and forcing our troops into other places, 911 wouldnt have happened and we would not be in the war today. so as an American citizen i can fully say that a lot of other Americans believe this too and truly pray that Obama will bring back the integrity of the U.S|`|gSdSRceRaa	Tell Achmadinejad to blow himself and let him know we'll be launching his answer from the nearest Tomahawk armed Guided Missile Cruiser !|`|Uac9AXmDaa	Iran need to understand that obama is not against him, but wants world piece, so why should Iran have a nuke?

K6J7rn3xaa	Yes.  Corruption & drug traffic operations between the island & FL, hidden behind the Cuban blockade? What does the UN says about that?  Violence in the northern borders of Mexico is Terrorism imported from Florida and the caribbean. Raul Castro's Cartel behind the corruption in the communist island. In regard to the international topic of drugs: Tons and tons of illegal cocaine from Bolivia, Peru or Colombia are smuggled in a daily basis into the USA through Florida via Cuba.  There are many evidences and proofs of the dirty huge corruption, drug traffic, and organized crime that operates around our maritime by the Gulf of Mexico and Florida stretch. Curiously, violence is being spread across the border between USA/Mexico. The US media blame only on Mexico, and systematically denies and hide terrorism in Cuba and Florida. Some radical terrorists want to destabilize militarize Mexico...Why? ( dirty martini can tell us... lol)  Cubans are so impoverished in their Island because the Blockade imposed since 1959. Cuba is the back yard of our Mexican-American Empire since the collapse of the Ex-soviet union.  Guantanamo will be closed, Drug trafficker Raul Castro overthrown, and the island democratized to get it ready for the annexation.  Cuba will be divided in 1/2.

AA12337052	Obama is on a path that will lead us to economic disaster.     He & his wife both spend money frivolously,  look at the $1,000+/Plate party they had while he was running for office. Rubbing elbows with the elite who gave him campaign contributions, which he freely spent on elaborate parties, expensive room service, Michelle's expensive clothing... etc.     Not to mention the contributions he received from Freddie & Fannie & then the govt had to bail them out! We are the ones who suffer in the long run. If money is no object for him, then why should he care?    Taxing the rich is not the answer either! His rob from the rich to give to the poor mentality will destroy us when all of the large corporations leave & take the jobs along with them!|`|70DZWz2Baa	Of course.|`|mT6b7INZaa	Yes...

I6dcRgD6aa	getting your news from Fox is like getting your knowledge about people from the National Enquirer. Watch c-span or CNN or MSNBC to watch Obama in context. I have a newmix & that is great cause you can observe how Fox is Fixed. Fox is trying to make people in this country vote for things against their own good so that rich people can make slaves out of us. We almost lost this country in the past 8 years & it is so hard to beleive people are so brainwashed they can't see this. I don't pay attention because I trust Obama but he is on CNN every day telling what is going on & yet everday people ask questions here as if they are clueless. He has websites & all kinds of ways for people to see the undeniable truth. It will take time to spend the money properly. People just can't throw the money around it takes time to organize things so no one thought it was going to be like a meal where you eat everything in one day. We take one bite, one meal at a time. Anything bigger than that won't work. So no one expects things to change over night but I would never trust anything said of Fox news. They will through the truth in sometimes to trick people into believing they are honest but they are not for this country they are for their own fat paycheck & the money from the rich people who depend on them to keep things in their favor.|`|qTYJGRETaa	That's because only 20% of the stimulus package actually goes toward creating new jobs and the rest have NOTHING to do with stimulating our economy.

It doesn't matter. Obama would have won either way. He was chosen based on skin color. The majority of Obama supporters cannot give a good reason other than: "he will bring change".

The fact of the matter is that they just wanted to help elect the first black president.|`|7y6yfrQlaa	they did all of that and the American people weren't interested|`|F28BfJKjaa	Haha.

McCain's advisers claimed that she gave up on McCain and flaunted like a diva to better her name for future elections.|`|3M3UtNyvaa	Bringing up Ayers, Wright, and Khalid IS the reason they lost. Apparently the American people aren't as stupid as McCain and Palin hoped. (Yourself being the notable exception)|`|JqYxr9Ubaa	Looks like you wish they ran an even MORE negative campaign, since the campaign was for the most part, extremely negative in the first place ("who is the real Obama," questioning his patriotism and trying to link him to Ayers, when the connection was tenuous at best).     I think McCain should have run a campaign based on why people should have voted FOR him as opposed to running a campaign on why people should vote AGAINST Obama.  It wound up looking very petty, childish, and inappropriate, especially for someone with as distinguished a history as McCain.      Still, it was smart not to go even more negative (Rev. Wright, etc), because people were already getting sick of the negative campaigning in general.  Had he been worse, it would have backfired and sent more voters to Obama (who would likely have won by an even higher margin than he did).      In any case, I hope the hardcore right gets as negative as possible and runs Palin in 2012.  It's going to be hilarious to watch Sarah get trounced in the primaries (you betcha!)
AA11086243	A. there were no WMD... so it was a lie... it's that simple...    was it an INTENTIONAL lie... hard to say or prove...    B. Plame was kind of in semi-retirement... desk jockey... but she could have been called back into service, if needed... until the admin plastered her identity across the papers...     C. yeah... Lincoln and Roosevelt weren't huge on the constitution in times of war... thanks for the obvious history lesson... it was bad then, it's bad now... (and I think there is a difference beween a constitutional violation and "war criminal," just saying... for Roosevelt)    but I think a trial would be pointless (to go after Bush)... I think it would be fairly easy for him to talk his way out of it... what is "torture"... and blah, blah, blah...|`|MEReSvZeaa	If Bush lied about WMD's, so did both Clintons and most of the democrats in Congress.|`|U0Rvsabdaa	Lincoln was a war criminal, FDR was never justified in rounding up all the  Japanese Americans and locking them up. Grant was mostly incompetent, Sherman was the war criminal.|`|YIWKPXokaa	President Bush himself said  that there were no WMD's
teKeLxX2aa	It is a thing of rarity, but it happens all the time (just not on television while millions of people are watching). It takes a certain type of person to deliver a speech, not just go up there and say the words, but captivate the audience in a way that changes their way of thinking (be it for good or bad). I've improvise good speeches on the spot for college, and I've seen other people that have gotten up in front of a crowd and done well. It's a skill that some people can never possess, but like freestyle rapping, if you have what it takes you can make it happen through trail and error.     Obama, Kennedy, FDR, all of them are noted for the speeches they've given as Presidents, but they had hours or days of preparation prior to their moment on the spotlight. However, considering how bad things can get if the President doesn't know what to say (take Bush for example) it's probably for the better that they are able to prepare and organize what they're going to say before they say it.|`|E4ECJcaFaa	Writing speeches for graduation, class assignments, or other purposes consists of a lot more than finding a few inspirational quotes and possibly a funny story or two. The key to writing good speeches lies in using a theme. If you always refer back to this theme, the audience will respond positively and remember your words. This does not mean that inspirational quotes are not important. However, they should be integrated into your speech in a way that makes sense.         The first task that a public speaker needs to focus on before they do any actual writing is the message they are trying to convey. My inspiration for this idea came from the speeches of John F. Kennedy. In his Inaugural Speech, he chose to focus on freedom. He addressed many different topics, but always came back to this idea of liberty. When asked to be the guest speaker at a National Honor Society induction recently, I decided to focus on how an individual's daily decisions add up to reveal that person's true character. We can not cheat in the small things and expect these blemishes to never surface. When the real tests in life occur, our character will not be able to withstand the pressure because we have not chosen the harder path all along. Why did I choose this as my theme? My audience consisted of Juniors and Seniors at the top of their respective classes. They had to meet stringent requirements in the areas of scholarship, community service, leadership, and character in order to be accepted into the organization. I wanted to leave them with one idea that might make them think twice. If you would like to see the actual speech, click here.    How does this relate to you? First, you must decide who will make up your audience. In a graduation speech, you are addressing your fellow classmates. However, parents, grandparents, teachers and administrators will also be present. While you will be focussing on people your age, what you say must be in line with the dignity of the ceremony itself. Remembering that, think of the ONE thought with which you want to leave your audience. Why only one idea? Mainly because if you reinforce a single point instead of focusing on entirely different ideas, your audience will have a greater tendency to remember it. A speech does not lend itself to having many themes. Stick with one really good theme, and use each point you make, your theme reinforcers, to bring that idea home.       If you would like some ideas for possible themes, look at the world around you. What are people concerned about? If you are speaking about the state of education, find one central idea like personal responsibility that you feel strongly about. Then return to that idea with each point you make. Write your individual points to reinforce your idea. To return to the graduation speech, check out these top ten themes to use when writing your speech.|`|c2dfad4dc1f663f9f98d8667a84e7f6daa	Yes, especially if the person is honest and it is something they're sincere about.|`|AA11598520	Yes, some are capable of it, just not Obama.|`|GMYNuFCDaa	Not for Obama, lol.    That is one thing Joe Biden is really good at. Of course if the audience knows anything he gets laughed out for all the whack stuff he pulls right out of his ***.|`|ohgrMZDkaa	Not for Obama, have you seen that guy without his teleprompter...but yes it is possible.|`|bda08b314a4966c36d4acd161c9ec0f6aa	Bill Clinton is one of the best at this.|`|1219d6000cca01c9f3c4489d1c7b4a16aa	Actually, they don't even write their speeches, they hire other people to write them for them.    I think it's possible to deliver a great speech on the spot, but it takes incredible speaking skills.  It would probably lack the organization of a well constructed speech, but sometimes words from the heart really connect with people rather than rehearsed statements that are known to work through various surveys and polling.|`|uGeo5zfSaa	Yeah. You just have to be emotionally motivated.|`|cPQ7TBcuaa	Yes. But it would have to be on a subject that you are knowledgeable and passionate about.|`|cWmx0J4jaa	sure, just always have a set of taliking points ready and then sometime when you are feeling it, you can deliver a quality speech.
rYNM67oyaa	The Air Force will train you in something else that's offered at the same base. If you have credit issues you won't have gotten that far. But if you did it would be the same thing.|`|lsHsXXtuaa	Well if you can't pass your classes in tech school most likely they will put you in another job. If you need a security clearance I would imagine they would just do the same: give you another job.|`|f02r2IGraa	If you rock out of your tech school then it's up to your superiors to decide on if you switch jobs (MOS) or be Generally Discharged.

UnXCTJUkaa	LMAO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...    I almost peed my pants from laughter after I read this!  Dear God!!!    First off, I'm wondering what YOU will say when you are living out of a cardboard box in 6 months to a year?  Will you admit that Big Government Spending does nothing to fix the economy?  Somehow, I doubt it.  You'll probably find some way of not blaming Obama for his failure, join his little "civilian defense force", and take your frustration over being wrong out on innocent bystanders.  Here are Obama and super Nazi Rahm Emanuel talking openly about it:    http://www.neithercorp.us/nforum/current...    This video explains exactly why Obama's "Stimulus Package" WILL FAIL:    http://www.neithercorp.us/nforum/geopoli...      The economy is breaking down because of the Private Federal Reserve's policy of fractional banking and creating money out of thin air, and our Government's out of control deficit spending.  The bank collapse is nothing compared to when the DOLLAR collapses in a year / year and a half.  Obama's stimulas will only create MORE DEBT.      Tell me, massive debt got us into this mess, how is more debt going to get us out?|`|U0Rvsabdaa	Do I have to remind you in six months when the recession is still there?    You can't fix everything in six months. Hell, it took Stalin five years to get Russia's industry up to speed, and he had great motivating factors (ie torture and gulags).|`|ZOXoPgJbaa	OH buddy keep dreaming. DOnt get me wrong I wish this as much as the next person. BUt I understand monetary policy and fiscal policy, and the actions Obama is taking is only going to make things terribly worse.|`|DlQd0m0Daa	It's already coming back! We don't need the stimulus! Wow, but we are going to be saddled with all sorts of pork...|`|tDZMJue9aa	no cause throwing money at a problem only makes that problem bigger it doesnt make the problem go away what are you going to say in six months when im right..see i told you republicans are stifling us? or are you still going to be blaming bush|`|AA10253095	I will never join a political party that promotes things that go against the word of God.    The economy is not going to roar in 6 months I can guarantee that.    If I wanted to live in a Socialist society, I would have been moving to North Korea but guess what I am not moving to that country where Kim Jong-Il fattens himself while his subjects go hungry.|`|AA10382849	Nice little rant. If only it were so. A lot of peoples are going to be turned upside done by this thing well beyond six months. Blind confidence in a plan that has never worked before is foolish to say the least. The engine of the American economy is the consumer and business, until they get their legs under them no amount of federal spending is going to make things better. See you in six months.|`|Cni4Zh77aa	If the economy gets back on track it will be because of Bush of course :p. Until then, it's Clinton's fault lol.|`|444pPdy5aa	What are you going to say in 6 months when things are worse than they are now?        We will just see how roaring our economy is in 6 months  Keep me in mind when I get in back in touch with you and remind you how bad things are in six months|`|OLCnQkmBaa	How stupid go read a book on FDR and his First Hundred Days and the deepening Depression.  Grow up.|`|hZJ6xx1Kaa	I'll say:  "Thank God, the economy is thriving despite Obama!"|`|fbb4ab0738eb7d2ea8be8024fec8d32aaa	Nobody wants what is coming at us like a runaway freight train.  Frankly, my dear, if the economy comes "roaring" back, I will be very glad to state on this forum that I was wrong.    But I'm not wrong.  I don't have to join the Democratic party.  I've been a Democrat all my life.  I'm still not wrong.|`|9bb789fb1a182ebae292a0ef4f9b205eaa	You are an idiot. look at history, anytime the government steps in the economy suffers. Plus who is this plan going to help.  How is $600 million more for the federal government to buy new cars helping us or $7 billion for modernizing federal buildings and facilities. This plan is going to change everything about America but not in a good way.|`|eIhD4y8Waa	What they should say is ,we told you we didn't need a pork filled spending -stumulus program.Becuse in realitty if the economy came back in six months the packaged pork deal would have had nothing to do with it.The bulk of the pork can't be eaten for 1 to 2 years. My rep. voted against it, thankfully from me.|`|AU70o6wTaa	wow, I mean wow. are you confused or what. the only thing I'll admit is in 6 months Obama and the Democrats will bring this country to a depression worse than the one in the 30's. this last package for $819B has an interest rate of 42% which is about $350B and none of it goes to help the American ppl. kind of makes you sick seeing all these groups grabbing for the money like there's no tomorrow and you think that in 6 months we'll be ok. wow.|`|YF1To4SGaa	This "stimulus" bill is nothing more than a socialist blank check. This country is so screwed. Thanks liberals, I knew you were going to kill is sooner or later... i'm afraid it may be sooner.|`|a4306cf4648141da0d25ebc2a0dbf89caa	You must not be keeping up on current affairs much.  Either that, or you're selectively reading only what you need to ask silly questions like this one.    All of the expert economists agree that it's going to take AT LEAST a year before the economy gets back on track.  AT LEAST a year.  So in six months when the economy is still in the tank, what are you going to say?  That it's the Republican's fault, I'll bet.    And you'll be just as wrong then as you are now.    As for the part about joining the Democratic party, that one's easy.    I'd rather stick needles in my eyes than join the Democratic party.|`|E1gKL2fSaa	Let me tell you what will happen.    The US will start to come back followed by 10 - 20% inflation within 2 years.    Then an induced recession to stop inflation.    This will happen because the government stepped in, instead of letting the market correct itself.|`|O5DZvc0Xaa	Wow..... that's quite a rosy outlook....    Sorry to attack your gumdrop unicorn fantasy... but look. Here's the deal.    IF the US economy recovers, it will only be AFTER the complete collapse of the dollar and the institution of a new supranational currency. And it won't happen within 6 months.     I don't think you realize what's happening here. This is going to have to get a lot worse before the ones who engineered it will allow it to get any better. They will hold our heads under the water until we consent to total globalization.    And both parties are controlled by the same globalist bankers, so we can all drop the partisan rhetoric.     Obama and Bush were in total agreement about the Banker Takeover Bill.... and they held hands while forcing it through Congress using threats and deception. Now they are best buds.     It's the biggest heist in human history. It's not an "accident," and it's not going to go away.    I know... the truth sucks. Have fun in the civilian work brigade!|`|b2efe4c24f079486fbaff579f92c1c00aa	I will become an Obamaite and personally kiss your a**.
xfv6526Gaa	Well lets see... Everyone that works at the DMV are state workers which means they are on salary which also means they will take their dear old time doing something which in turn ticks off a lot of people .. I myself think they should be switched over to commission and then you will see how fast they start to work.. It could also be the new dunkin donuts for the police!!|`|JDltTREfaa	Probably for administrative hearings.  (For example, if you get arrested for DUI you are facing criminal charges through the court system but also having your driver's license suspended.  People who are facing a license suspension have the right to an administrative hearing to try to convince the state to let them keep their licenses.  The arresting officer has to testify in those cases.)|`|ec6d6526154860f9cab361f34526d848aa	Because there are sections of the vehicle code that they are charged with enforcing and the Local, County, and State police can not.    In my state, some laws relating to titles and the regulation of auto dealerships fall under their jurisdiction -the SOS Police also are charged with policing licensing facilities and security of the govenor and state senate complex.|`|XU5SVQZDaa	The population is becoming more and more violent. To protect the workers and everyone else who has to go to the DMV. We have to have protection at the grocery stores,too-security guards on duty everywhere, now.|`|9TXrJ32Daa	Depends on the State.  Some of the DMVs are overseen by the State Police or are DMV Police.  Others, might have police officers going in there for administrative hearings other business.
ybpJUWRnaa	This is one isolated case.    Go buy Call of Duty 4. You can run around and kill muslims.    I don't think this is representative of some kind of vast hidden conspiracy. God only knows why the game maker thought putting something like that in for the U.S. market was a good idea.|`|q4EXFhV7aa	The game was created LONG before Obama became President. Could these questions get any more ridiculous? It is disturbing and Nintendo should pull the game.....but it has nothing to do with Obama.|`|5cc93dc15af56e8f47884e200463a48eaa	did you even read the link that you posted?  the first two words are "Months ago"...the software is written by a 3rd party and is most likely not handled in house by Nintendo, etc.  it doesn't say much for the Beta testing of the toys for that not to have been discovered.|`|AA10168935	It's amazing that all the other thousands of parents who bought those kids the same game hasn't noticed that. It's a lie.
AA10253095	If you are using a recipe of your own then it is not illegal but you have to use a different name for it.|`|8063947433f50c3e93546a4ba2133fdcaa	You can make it however you like, as long as you haven't stolen the exact recipe and are reusing it.  You can't call it "Imitation Oxi-Clean" though.|`|RkfIPD7Iaa	To be perfectly honest, there is no law against even producing the exact same product, unless it is a patented process.    For something as simple as Oxy-clean, you can definitely make the same stuff.  However, you can't cal it 'Imitation Oxy-clean', since the name Oxy clean is trademarked.
bQKNjFqyaa	It hasn't been closed yet, he just plans to close it, and he has no idea what he's going to do with them.

After the closure, they will be held in US detention facilities awaiting trial.|`|CnM2U1bXaa	Obama let them come to the USA! what an idiot|`|AA11648899	some will be released to terrorize again.    others will move in our neighborhoods.|`|neuprBeGaa	They haven't been moved yet.  The prison is scheduled to close sometime in the next year, after a panel that includes the Attorney General and the Secretaries of Defense and Homeland Security decide what to do with each of them.    The ones that can be charged with crimes will be moved to U.S. prisons for their trials.  Others will be shipped to their home countries or to other countries that will take them.|`|6Fsliwlhaa	Obama signed an order to close the prison but it isn't closed yet.  The military has a year to close it and the Department of Defense is working out where the detainees will be sent when it is closed completely.|`|mlTX4i8Caa	obama is letting them into the us for some reason|`|0YtvCuakaa	Its still open, it has at least a year left because even Obama doesn't know what to do with them.|`|RTx1D48paa	There are some subtle bits here you have failed to appreciate...  FIRST They are not "Prisoners".....they are "Detainees" ; the difference is legally important  SECOND Obama has not signed an order to close GITMO....he signed an order to find a way to close GITMO.... not as easy as it sounds    There are 253 detainees..... most are VERY bad men.....KILLERS....  We can not send them back to their own country because most would be executed...... only a small number of countries will give them asylum and even then they want to pick the prisoners they want to welcome..... leaving us with the worst of the worst    It is NOT a good idea to move them to America..... this would  change their staus in significant ways..... they would be given habeus corpus rights .....rights to trial ( they do not qualify for POW status or Geneva Convention protection)  This means they will get lawyers and be tried.....as there were no Miranda Rights.....no legal counsel before interrogation..... and a host of other imperfections.....it is likely they would get bail / be set free.... as they have no place to go.....they could be living next door or walking down your street.....we do not have enough money or spare law enforcement officers to watch them all.....     If you have a liberal friend.....thank him for making you and your family LESS secure in your own home.....|`|xSu5A4eYaa	they moved them to different jail|`|vj3080wbaa	they never closed the prison yet .... they will clothes in next year...|`|6yVyylqBaa	They are still there...he won't close it for a year.|`|uCr1uiIuaa	The prison is still active.  The President, not Obama, not Barack, not anything else but his new title, signed off on the prison's eventual closing.  The military has a limited amount of time, I've heard nine months to one year, to find different accommodations for the prisoners.
AA10719402	Conservatives like to spend money on defense.    Liberals like to spend money on domestic issues.    Conservatives like big government to limit social rights (pro-life).    Liberals like big government to provide us with services (education, health).|`|q4EXFhV7aa	Conservatives see most issues in black and white terms.....i.e. there is one correct belief....one right side of nearly every issue.

Your choice.|`|n95AR8CYaa	Liberals are tax and spend and Conservatives are borrow and spend.|`|Z7W6FRoSaa	The liberal, progressive worldview is modeled on a nurturant parent family. Briefly, it assumes that the world is basically good and can be made better and that one must work toward that. Children are born good; parents can make them better. Nurturing involves empathy, and the responsibility to take care of oneself and others for whom we are responsible. On a larger scale, specific policies follow, such as governmental protection in form of a social safety net and government regulation, universal education (to ensure competence, fairness), civil liberties and equal treatment (fairness and freedom), accountability (derived from trust), public service (from responsibility), open government (from open communication), and the promotion of an economy that benefits all and functions to promote these values, which are traditional progressive values in American politics.    The conservative worldview is the strict father model and assumes that the world is dangerous and difficult and that children are born bad and must be made good. The strict father is the moral authority who supports and defends the family, tells his wife what to do, and teaches his kids right from wrong. The only way to do that is through painful discipline - physical punishment that by adulthood will become internal discipline. The good people are the disciplined people. Once grown, the self-reliant, disciplined children are on their own. Those children who remain dependent (who were spoiled, overly willful, or recalcitrant) should be forced to undergo further discipline or be cut free with no support to face the discipline of the outside world.    So, project this onto the nation and you see that to the right wing, the good citizens are the disciplined ones - those who have already become wealthy or at least self-reliant - and those who are on the way. Social programs, meanwhile, "spoil" people by giving them things they haven't earned and keeping them dependent. The government is there only to protect the nation, maintain order, administer justice (punishment), and to provide for the promotion and orderly conduct of business. In this way, disciplined people become self-reliant. Wealth is a measure of discipline. Taxes beyond the minimum needed for such government take away from the good, disciplined people rewards that they have earned and spend it on those who have not earned it.  In the strict father model, the big thing is discipline and moral authority, and punishment for those who do something wrong. That came out very clearly in the Bush administration's foreign and domestic policy. With Schwarzenegger, it's in his movies: most of the characters that he plays exemplify that moral system. He didn't have to say a word! He just had to stand up there, and he represents Mr. Discipline. He knows what's right and wrong, and he's going to take it to the people. He's not going to ask permission, or have a discussion, he's going to do what needs to be done, using force and authority. His very persona represents what conservatives are about.|`|CUl0iD7Caa	Conservative policies generally emphasize empowerment of the individual to solve problems. They believe in personal responsibility, limited government, and free markets. The heart of conservatism is that the role of government should be to provide people the freedom necessary to pursue their own goals.     Liberal policies generally emphasize the need for the government to solve people's problems. They believe in governmental action to achieve equal opportunity and that it is the duty of the State to alleviate social problems. They believe the role of the government should be to guarantee that no one is in need.     The difference between the two ideologies is like night and day. One benefits the people to no end offering unlimited social and welfare programs at all costs even to detrament to society as a whole while the other benefits the sucessful and the well to do offering incentives and giving breaks often ignoring the poor and allowing the system to crash and burn when need be.     each has there positives and negatives. to the core of the beliefs, you have to decide whats more important. a capitalistic society that allows companies and individuals to not only florish but also to crash and burn of there own free will or a society that wants everyone to be equal and for individuals or entities of great means to spread the wealth and care for the not so fortunate to no end.    pick your poison

McCain saying this paint him as a White racist who look down upon Blacks.|`|U0Rvsabdaa	It is peripherally annoying, but relatively minor.

u6ALw1gAaa	If the items could be used to smoke pot then they are illegal and you could face criminal charges.  It is called Possession of Drug Paraphernalia.    Yes they can go through your suitcases at random.  They may also walk K-9s around your suitcases.  If the pipe had been used to smoke pot, or you have clothes in your suitcase with the odor of pot on them the dog will hit on the suitcase.  if the dog hits on your suitcase, they will definitely go through it.      Common sense.|`|OGEC7RFwaa	i am not 100% sure, but i think as long as it hasnt been used (no residue) you should be able to. but again, i am not completely sure...|`|EPqnB7Epaa	As long as there isn't any pot residue in them you should be okay.|`|oAYCestzaa	no but that is tricky I would definetly call up the airport and ask before you waste your money !|`|4fe4fa0093052951c5515ef2f32cefffaa	No, they are not allowed in the United States.

Also, make sure there is NO resin left in there.|`|HHICEewjaa	Pipes and Bongs are not illegal.  What you smoke in them may be, if it is anything besides tobacco.  If marijuana is smoked in any of the items you bring back, there will be residue in them.  At that point it is no longer memorabilia, it is paraphernalia.  And since you are carrying it over sees, it is a felony.  If you want that as a souvenir then just make sure to bring back new, unused ones.|`|xCYBBpE6aa	YES it is very possible they'll check thru your luggage. I went to Europe in April: my luggage was gone thru & they left a red card in my luggage indicating they went thru it. That was a nice surprise.

wcegjzyWaa	When working with conflict diamonds, those two sectors are defined too narrowly, as there are many actors involved. It would be better to divide everything into private and public sectors.    Actors in the private sector include:  NGOs would be those organizations involved in the Kimberley Process like Global Witness or the Canada Africa Partnership.    Cooperations like DeBeers are also included in the private sector but can hardly be considered NGOs, so they need their own category (often they're called MNCs - multinational cooperations). The World Diamond Council might also be included in this category, as it's made up of diamond cooperations.    The smugglers themselves are of course also part of the private sector and could be included here.    The public sector:    Governments would be the governments of the states who are involved in diamond trading in general and/or have become members of the Kimberley Process.    Intergovernmental associations (IGOs) would be organizations like the UN that are made up of several or many governments. The African Union (AU) or European Union (EU) are also in this category.    Hope that helps!
ZbnVjxQOaa	No sir, you are entirely wrong in making the assertion the UN is not a form of gov't. It is a vehicle for one world gov't and has been since its inception in 1945.    See the Charter, written in large measure by Alger Hiss, advisor to FDR who was later unmasked as a Soviet agent by Whittaker Chambers. Since the statue of limitations was past, Hiss served time in jail for lying about being a communist.    Below is a link to understand more about the UN. We must get the US out of the UN and the UN out of the US.|`|AA10025824	Yes, at least you're more right than if you called it a government.  It's designed to be a group of nations united.  But it feels more and more like it's losing it's ability to accomplish anything.|`|rWqrN7Apaa	Actually the UN is definitely a form a government and technically the closest we have to a single world government that helps all people tackle the issues. (don't listen to the online/computer conspiracy weirdos!)|`|cWmx0J4jaa	a Liberal human rights organization that requires countries to listen to them.|`|AA10867564	a little of both. they have some power through economic sanctions and money/troops collected from member nations. however, they spend a lot of time trying to stop wars and help the poor.    technically, they have no real governing power, but can force their decisions on other countries.|`|50zbKv0jaa	no your not  it is an organization to promote dialogue to stop wars Between member states  human rights is only a minor and non Essential part  of the un    it was not intended to nor will ever be a government it does things with member agreement only|`|4TT8lSgwaa	It is a big boy's club owned by US, UK, France, Germany, ...|`|f63ba71f316e8a0101a83d2986ff5c54aa	Of course  the UN will only protect those who destroy each other...lol.|`|RfGiuZ15aa	It should be a great big world watchdog but it has lost its way. It has lost sight of what it stands for. Far too many nations which have no right to be there are members of the UN. We have recognised failed states, theocratic kingdoms, dictators, corrupt presidents of African basket case economies sitting alongside democratic nations and wielding greater power. As for human rights, members of the UN Council of Human Rights include Saudi Arabia, Nigeria, Egypt and Pakistan, countries whose record of human rights should preclude them from sitting on anything more important than a toilet seat. I think you would be more correct in saying that the United Nations is a corrupt, morally bankrupt and useless organisation which has long since served its purpose and should be disbanded in favour of a Union of Democratic Nations.

AA11440601	It does not.    One of several Mayan calendars is the Long Count calendar, which is reset to day 0 every 1,872,000 days or 7057.5 years. The next reset date, by some calculations, is December 21, 2012. This is not a prediction of the end of the world.    These predictions are scare tactics, conspiracy theories, and chances to make money from books and movies.    Ever since the Y2K and 6/6/6 (June 6, 2006) End of the World scenarios did not pan out, the scare mongers, conspiracy theorists, book sellers, and television executives have been touting the 2012 End of the World scenario. When 2012 does not happen either, I am sure they will think of something else.    "But of that day or hour, no one knows, neither the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father. Be watchful! Be alert! You do not know when the time will come." (Mark 13:32-33)    Jesus told us in no uncertain terms that we were not to know when the end of the world would come but that we were always to be ready.    The early Christian Church thought that Jesus was going to return at any moment. Only after a couple of centuries did the Church realize that it may be 2,000 or 4,000 or 8,000 years before Jesus returns.    The Catholic Church wisely follows Jesus' advice and teaches that each of us should live as if we will meet our maker in the next ten minutes and that we need to work to make the world a better place for our 100 X great-grandchildren.    Do not worry about the end of the world. Trust God to make sure everything happens to plan. Just be ready to meet God at any time.    For more information, about what Catholics believe about the end of the world, see: http://www.americancatholic.org/Newslett...    With love in Christ.|`|DAMZKbpDaa	I haven't seen the poll where most people think the world would end in 2012. Could you provide a link?

But, if we play our cards right, we should all still be alive in three years to find out first hand.    I can two ways in which 2012 relates to the world today.    First, its still in the future so we know that it will arrive.  Second, because we know, we can act to plan for its arrival.    Anything beyond that is not something that I am capable of answering.|`|bf2a3cdfd3a1c0386023cef0e5cd4b0faa	Nothing... it's just another year|`|VIK4jt0Oaa	Is God going to snap his fingers and end it all?

You have just endured 13 years of mindless droll, that was supposed to have prepared you for the rest of your life, but taught you NOTHING!, about the REAL cost of credit.

Save up the money, for whatever it is you feel you HAVE to have, and then buy it on your credit card, and PAY IT OFF.    If you learn nothing else?  Be careful, about marriage.

As for your friends?  Forget your friends from high school.  They will disappear soon enough.  You need to hold on to those people, who have placed a high value on thrift, and responsibility.

Then we will be forced to go with a world currency. Then the printing presses will stop printing dollars. Of course, this may be the reason for the wild spending....to force us to get rid of the dollar. Think about it. This is just crazy that the Democrats are promising multi billions to all kinds of projects.|`|YF1To4SGaa	The people pay with their freedom. Socialism make slaves of it's people, every fricking time.     150,000,000 dead people at the hands of socialist leaders in the 1900's alone can't be wrong. Liberals never were very good with history.
AfaFCiKxaa	When people have money in their pockets they spend it.  When states eliminate programs, people have less money in their pockets.    When money is spent it's spent on stuff that has to come from somewhere and be made by somebody.    That's how the economy moves.|`|4zijn0cgaa	Didn't`t you get the memo the Democrats love to waste other people`s money.|`|SlhuFfuZaa	In the first 6 answers there was a bit of truth in each answer, except that they didn't get deep enough.  Yes the government has to borrow the money, but the money comes from the privately owned Federal Reserve System, who borrows it from the World Bank, the Rothschild Foundation.   Yes, the money is spent on merchandise that must come from someplace and those places are China, India, Mexico, Bangladesh, Pakistan and other countries. There is very little manufacturing in the U.S. anymore, so we are giving the money to the foreign countries to stock our shelves, paying them again when we buy it and paying a consumer tax to the state and federal government. If we have jobs, we pay an income tax to the state and Federal government and they use that tax money to pay back the Federal Reserve.  And, yes, the Federal Government is going deeper in debt each year it operates and has since 1913 when the Federal Reserve System was founded and they usurped the Congressional power to print and coin money, which is against the Constitutional.  The stimulus package is not designed to save the government but to destroy the Constitution and it's sovereignty as a nation for control policy.|`|1amF7oNwaa	This has nothing to do with making the economy better.

If the guy who doesn't get his unemployment extended loses his house then the bank doesn't get paid, which is kind of what got us in this mess in the first place.    Don't think of it as paying for things, think of it as paying people for work. And work is good.    No.  The market already crashed.

Oh sure Marxism is the best plan for the world because it means you are not allowed to have an opinion of your own, and if you disagree with the Grandest Leader who never makes a mistake, then you will be sent to labor camp to work hard without pay till you agree to pledge all allegiance and loyalty and even if you choose this, you will be monitored for the rest of your natural life.

lvBUl3Zdaa	It is not correct to say that people are retiring younger. Actually they have raised the minimum age to collect. So if somebody retires early, they don't collect Social Security until they do reach retirement age.     It is not a consideration that people may live a few years longer nowadays. They don't live many years longer. You could look that up to get the difference in life expectancy.     The point of Social Security is that it pays as it goes. It is not an investment program that pays you back the money you put in. It is intended to be an income supplement that is available to every retiring senior, whether they earned enough money to save a large nest egg during their working years or not. That is how it has been right from the beginning. At that time, too many people who worked honest but low-paying jobs their whole lives had nothing to show for it at retirement time.     What you seem to be proposing is changing the system in mid-gear. You want to withdraw your money and force people like your parents or grandparents who met requirements to keep working when they reach retirement age, whether they are able to or notor more likely, they would look directly to you, as their working descendants, for support. I doubt that's what you'd want to happen.    As far as keeping Social Security solvent, it would be simple to tweak the taxes of the rich just a little bit. 401K's are only as good as the investment they are in. Right now a lot of people have lost half or more of their retirement money that was in 401K's. People would be in deep trouble if Bush had managed to privatize Social Security and forced Americans to invest in the stock market, as he was threatening to do.|`|VWLCwLNMaa	That's how it works. Always has. The SS taxes you pay are being paid out to those who are currently on SS. Just as the SS taxes that they paid were being paid out to their parents and grandparents.    Look at it as an insurance plan, for yourself,  that you're making payments on.    It has worked for 70 years. How can it be a scam?|`|a7a7a0bfe671ddedd1999ac93097444caa	Okay, a clarification...    Social Security isn't supposed to be, nor is it called at TAX... it is INSURANCE !!    What is WRONG with Social Security is that SINCE it was a government-run insurance policy it was MAKING money in the 50's and 60's... and Congress just couldn't keep their hands off the MONEY to pay for OTHER THINGS.    The SECOND thing wrong, is that it was intended as a safety net, and NOT a "national retirement" plan.    Social Security doesn't JUST pay "old folks"... if a parent dies, the child will recieve Social Security Survivors benefits until they turn 18.    Should they young pay... YES, until Congress is forced to modify it's spending habits.|`|i5F2jwvhaa	Yes    I had to pay it    So do you|`|9PAavWnyaa	Yes. A person who is receiving social security today was providing the social security income for another retiree when he/she was working. The money the retiree is now receiving is not the money he/she contributed to the system, but the money that a current worker is contributing. It's a cycle where a worker is in essence providing the income for the retiree.  * Periodically the Social Security Administration will raise the age for full retirement, based on the fact that people are living longer and are healthier. For some unfathomable  reason they have not changed the early retirement age of 62 (at least not to my knowledge). Perhaps the SSA should raise the number of work quarters from the current forty to, say eighty. I don't think it's unreasonable to require that a person contribute to the social security system for twenty years instead of just ten before they begin drawing from it.|`|AA11819105	sos tax is nothing who's going to pay for the stimulus money|`|58EydBwwaa	The system is ready to collapse. Not only do we have millions of baby-boomers getting ready to retire, but we have a crumbling economy with millions out of work. Add a growing dependence on prescription medications (for which Medicare foots the bill) and we have a serious problem on our hands. Its certainly our duty as humans to care for our elderly, but I'm looking back nostalgically at the days in which families cared for their parents and grandparents privately.     The Amish can and do opt out. They do not pay into social security, and they do not collect. I think this courtesy should be extended to the general populace.|`|cWmx0J4jaa	what else you gonna do? They let the program go under and only the current workers can save us. God help us when they get older!|`|rgDLovFhaa	you could cancel it, but then you would be screwed when you get old|`|XU5SVQZDaa	Yes, we all had to pay it.|`|AA11409272	No, the younger generation should be allowed to opt out. This ponzi scheme was a bad idea and only getting worse.|`|3FtC9D40aa	The problem is that pretty soon there will be more people on social security than there will be people paying into the system. These deficits will balloon until it consumes the entire federal budget. China is under the same problem. That is why they are soo eager to loan money to us.     Ultimately there will be only a few methods of recourse. Raise taxes severely on everyone and/or slash benefits, or abolish the program entirely and replace it.    It is insanity in light of these facts that soo many people are against 401k type programs. To let people decide how their money will be invested and spent. After all who knows best what you need than you. So why are you the last person to get a say so in your future?

The logistics don't make sense either.    Our economic activity amounts to 14+ trillion dollars per year and we think that that the direct stimulus of 300 billion spread out over 4 to 5 years is going to create some artificial bottom that'll keep the free-market from falling to find equilibrium?  It's almost laughable.      We'll throw more good money after bad and devalue our dollar.  It's a lame attempt to secure spending projects for Obama's next 4 years.

JDltTREfaa	I'd recommend a four year degree - especially because it sounds as though you want to get into some specialized areas.  (You don't get to go straight into K9 or become a detective, etc.  You generally have to start out as a police officer and get promoted.  A degree will help you do this because it will make you more promotable.)    I would recommend taking English classes (especially including any types of Creative Writing and Journalism). Law enforcement requires a TREMENDOUS amount of report writing and one of the best things you can do for your potential career is to learn how to write well. Your superiors, attorneys, and judges WILL be reading your reports so it is critically important to be able to convey information in a precise and easy to read manner.     I would also recommend anything that will help you communicate verbally: Speech, drama, debate, etc. Police officers/investigators have to be able to interview victims, criminals, witnesses, etc. They also have to be able to testify in court, present their findings/suggestions to superiors, attorneys, etc. So any experience in speaking and public speaking will be a huge plus.    Look into ride alongs and internships in various areas of the criminal justice field.  This will allow you to meet people who are doing the job so you might get a feel for what you think you'd like to work toward.    Good luck, and thanks so much for being willing to serve your community!|`|n3ndLgh5aa	You are doing great so far! The more education, the better!  Although I'm afraid you need some experience before you can get into any kind of special unit.  K9 usually has some special requirements, you need to live in a house and have a specific size back yard....I am not sure what else.  Just keep going, you will probably have to wait to be 20 and a half before you get into the process to get into the Academy....do some patrol, get the feel of it, and then you can decide exactly what you want to do for the rest of your career.  Keep up the good work!!!|`|8567eea50ee05006e45298c8a269c261aa	No one "gets right into" the K9 or investigative units.    You will have to spend 3-5 years learning how to be a cop doing patrol work and prove yourself there before getting a specialized unit.
JqYxr9Ubaa	You DO know that you're supposed to do your own homework in Law School, yes?     This is indicative of the type of behavior you'll be engaged in as an attorney after you graduate and take the bar.  If I were you, I'd pay very close attention in ethics class.  Otherwise, get ready to throw out 100k+ in money spent on a legal education that you rendered useless due to your lack of desire to do your own work.|`|JDltTREfaa	Hmmm . . . when I went to law school cheating was a violation of the Honor Code and would result in expulsion.
gasquENMaa	When you go to court, give the Clerk's office the correct address.    As far as the fine, you already have the statute number. On the back of the ticket, near the bottom, is a phone number to the Clerk of Courts office ( or Mayor's Court,  depending on who issued the ticket). Call that number, give them the statute number and they can tell you the cost if you are pleading guilty.    I hope this helps and you can find it useful

Best of luck|`|LxVnBHI9aa	Is not hard as long as you have a highschool education. Its just long... and boring. But considerably easier than an SAT.    I didn't prepare myself at all and got a 70.|`|fSrmGhOfaa	This probably isn't going to be a very well-accepted answer, but why do people go to such great lengths to cheat the system?    The ASVAB is designed to find out what you might be good at. At least that's what it does if it's taken cold, without preparation. If you prepare, all it shows is how good you are at taking the stupid test. It's results are meaningless. There are a couple of examples among the recent questions. One's a "Tech School Question." The other is something like "What if somebody sucks at..."    This guy's washing out of the school the military's sending him to because his scores on the ASVAB said he could cut it.    Maybe it does work some times. But what happened if, on the job, the guy couldn't hack it? A ship could sink, a missile could fire, a plane could crash... people could lose their lives... all because some dope thought he could beat the system because he thought he was better than he really was.    I enlisted in the Navy without any idea what I wanted to be. I had a BA in math, but I didn't think there was much an enlisted guy could do with math. My rating, based on my ASVAB scores, picked me. I would never have dreamed I'd be doing what I did. I must have done it pretty well because, when it came time to extend for my E-6, somebody dusted off my degree and recommended me for OCS. I retired at 45 after 25 years in. I got a couple more degrees mostly on the GI Bill, and started a second career. I got a job managing government projects on the West Coast for a management consulting firm based on my military experience, management experience (Navy officer for 20 years), my education, and my recent security clearance.    My cousin enlisted because I did. He wanted to be a musician. He was pretty good on the trombone. He wound up a BT based on his ASVAB. The Navy sent him to a ton of schools. When he got out after 16 years, he got a job as a Building Inspector for a city in Washington state. He's going to retire this year and travel. When he gets done traveling the city offered him a position as consultant -- higher pay, and he can name his own hours.    Let the ASVAB do its job. It's an aptitude test. All you know is what you want. Let the military see what you might be good at. You might like it better if you're good at it than if you're not.

If each person had an additional $2600 in their pocket, the infrastructure would not be fixed.  The generation of neglect that began with the election of Ronald Reagan needs to end.  The $819 billion stimulus package will be the beginning of ending that neglect.    The Republican mantra of "cut taxes" has left the United States in the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.  The concentration of wealth is similar to that of of 1929 and CEO pay and corporate profit increase mirror the decline of unions in this country (one more Reagan blunder: union-busting).  Trickle-down economics has been a failure of a magnitude, to steal an idea from another of Reagan's ridiculous term, that if a foreign power had done the kind of damage this economic philosophy has caused, it would be considered an act of war.|`|9HoXpsP6aa	Our government is only serving those who already have money!  Isn't this crazy?

The recipe is quite simple, take care of your primary obligations:  Family, School, Your Physical/Mental Sharpness, your community, and then think about rounding yourself out.  Be a leader and use these extracurriculars to add life experience and fill you out as person.  If you just want another notch on the resume, you've missed the point of high school, and will miss the point of the USNA.    Finally, a man cannot serve two masters.  Personally invest yourself in only a couple activities rather than spread out over many.  Trust me, people looking at applications appreciate someone who stays with only one or two activities rather than a hero who is surficially involved in five.

I had no idea it was suspended. bast^^^^ actually put me in county for a 200.00 bond|`|j9YiR51Xaa	Yes it actually was last August on a military post in northern new york. I was at a passions party while my husband was deployed with a bunch of other army wives. I was accused of M.I.P. and M.I.C. Then I got into it with the Military Police because there were 8 cops there and a drug dog and they tried telling us that they were called for "noise control" So I looked at him and said, "I'm not an idiot you dont need 8 cops and a drug dog for a noise complaint dumbass" Well The cop didn't think that was as funny as I did and told me to sit down. Then they were trying to help one of my girlfriends up and they dropped her causing her to slam her head on the curb. So I went up to her and tried to help her and I was arrested for interferring with a police investigation. When I had to go see the Judge Advocate they dropped all my charges because I had no B.A.C. and I was doing my civilian duty trying to help the girl especially since I have a license in nursing.

bcc62a4f188c1522006cc8ba2c7b102aaa	Yes I can.    The phrases in Barack Obamas inauguration speech that have evoked the greatest enthusiasm across the political spectrum of the US establishment, from the Republican right to liberal Democrats, were those suggesting that the American people are responsible for the present economic catastrophe. Our economy is badly weakened, he declared, a consequence of greed and irresponsibility on the part of some, but also our collective failure to make hard choices and prepare the nation for a new age.  Precisely what those hard choices are Obama did not specify, but he made clear they in no way involve a challenge to the capitalist market system, declaring that its power to generate wealth and expand freedom is unmatched.  He broadly hinted that the hard choices he would make involve sweeping cuts in social programs, including ending programs that dont work. This policy of austerity, which, as he had previously indicated, would include cuts in bedrock programs such as Social Security and Medicare, was summed up in his call for a new era of responsibility.  The implicit demand for greater sacrifice from the American people was hailed by liberal commentators such as the Washington Posts David Ignatius, who praised Obama for telling the people that the crisis was partly our fault. He continued, We all know the Pogo line about how we have met the enemy, and he is us. Obama implicitly seemed to embrace it.  Right-wing columnist George Will in his Washington Post op-ed piece enthused over the same lines, writing that one of Obamas themes was that Americans do not just have a problem, they are a problem.  These approving comments accurately sum up the deeply reactionary and deceitful thrust of Obamas speech, behind its I feel your pain rhetoric. Obamas attempt to foist the blame for the failure of American capitalism on the American people is nothing short of a libel, the purpose of which is to obscure those social interests that are really responsible for the unfolding catastrophe and justify even deeper attacks on the working class.  The working class bears no responsibility for the collapse of the financial system and the resulting recession that is developing into a full-scale depression. Working people have no control over the policies and actions of the multimillionaires and billionaires who bestride Wall Street. They had no say in concocting the Ponzi schemes that generated multimillion-dollar compensation packages and colossal personal fortunes for the financial aristocracy until they collapsed, as they were bound to.  Working people are the victims of the maniacal greed of the corporate-financial elite, which itself is an expression of fundamental contradictions within the irrational economic system over which they preside. One would think from Obamas remarks that the broad masses of people in the US have been living the good life. In reality, for three solid decades they have seen their social position decline and their living standards deteriorate as an ever-greater share of the national wealth was funneled into the bank accounts of the ruling elite.  The single most significant feature of American lifethe staggering growth of social inequalitywent without mention in Obamas speech. He could not allude to it and at the same time accuse the people of bearing collective guilt.  Obamas single fleeting reference to corporate criminalitygreed and irresponsibility on the part of somewas itself a cover-up. On the part of some? The virtual collapse of the US and global economy is not the result of a few bad apples or mere aberrational behavior. Fraud, incompetence, recklessness wereand remainpervasive and systemic in American capitalism.  This is a system that for decades has starved and dismantled basic industry, allowed the social infrastructure to rot and driven down the living standards of the majority of the population in order to generate higher profits for the elite from financial manipulation and speculation. The American ruling class stands exposed and disgraced before the world as a semi-criminal social layer.  Obamas new era of responsibility signifies, in reality, a general amnesty for the system, the class and those in government who are truly responsible for the crisis. None of the bankers and speculators who created a mountain of paper values on the basis of predatory home loans that were bound to fail are to be held accountable. Nor are the government regulators who ran interference and served as their accomplices. Likewise, the congressmen of both parties who dismantled regulations and slashed corporate taxes in exchange for campaign funds and other bribes.|`|aVEVchFxaa	That if the haters (Repubs/Cons and foreigners) will "unclench" their fists of hate, that he'll be more open to have an intelligent discussion with them to move forward.

AA10075828	Half of the right can't even understand why taxation exists. They willfully ignore the fact that the economy grew under even higher tax rates than we currently have (the rates Obama wants to return to), while forgetting that SOMEONE has to pay for federal services, the military, etc. etc. So, let's be smart: Let's cut taxes so we have even less income to pay our rising debts!    Nope, they're jsut too dull to see that cutting taxes doesn't encourage businesses to hire workers. More workers are used to produce more products and services. Someone tell me why a business, regardless of its tax situation, would produce more products no one wants to (or can afford to) buy? Who is going to go out and buy stuff when their home is worth less than they owe on it, or is being forclosed on? Who is going to go shopping a lot when they are worried about losing their house, health care, college financial aid?    Talk about putting the cart before the horse. Businesses need a reason to hire workers--why wouldn't they just pocket their tax cuts to beef up their profit margin, rather than waste it paying workers to supply what there is no demand for?|`|5d9pCmjyaa	Some people will never be happy even if you hung them with a new rope.

uRecsvaZaa	Yup what these ppl listen above are pretty much correct. Somaliland wanted to be recognized as a new nation... You are exactly right we shouldn't seperate our selves we are after all one people. But guess what "us somalis" dont like to think like you and me. We do like to seperate ourselves we divide each other into "tribes/clans", and each tribe/clan think higher of themselves. Well its up to me and you, the Somali Youth to get rid of this unceccacary division of "tribes" and unite. This whole division of somaliland, and now puntland(also in somalia) wants independence, BECAUSE EVERYONE THINKS THAT THEIR TRIBE IS THE BEST. Tribes were originally created to keep track of family, and for goverment. Like u know how in the U.S their is state power, then federal power. Like a chief of the tribe, and the federal power back then made it easier in the goverment perspective. WELL THIS WAS BACK THENNNN. Now the tribe concept was manipulated and is now what is causing all this fighting. All these civil wars.    I dont like the idea of tribes, as you said we are ONE PEOPLE    we should unite rather than divide, and its up to the youth to unite us.|`|U9bQgfY9aa	I suggest you look it up on wikipedia.|`|AA10837061	Somaliland, is the northern part of today's Somalia. It was originall a British colony, until the whole of Somalia became a country. Somaliland refused to join, and wanted to be recognized as a seperate country.

XuG5g9Zgaa	Go speak with an attorney.  In CA, you can also go to family law facilitators located inside of the family court house closest to you.  Also, go to child support so they can establish legal paternity and child support.     I don't understand why you try to negotiate with him.  Consider going to child  support so they canl get a court order for money and paternity.  Once you have the order, he should pay through them and you don't have to beg for money to take care of your child.  If he feels they are asking for too much, you can agree to a lesser amount but make sure he pays through child support so they can keep track of payments and you don't have to discuss money with him.      All the other stuff you mentioned is water under the bridge.  You two two have a child whose priorities supersede yours.|`|XGgPhaDbaa	Consult the lawyer- not yahoo answers.

C7wjR42Daa	You need to ask a specific question so we can answer you.    Infantry working conditions..where? While on base?, in the field?,  when out at sea?, in combat?|`|0szdPqI0aa	ON BASE LIVING CONDITIONS:  On base, you live in the barracks, unless your marries. but if your not, you get the barracks and it is similar to college dorms.   you wake up, pt, clean up, go to chow, train, and maybe you get the rest of the day to rest, or pt some more.  and you keep doing that. sometimes you train a long long time.    when deployed to iraq or something, you will be working in harsh conditions. You go out in full gear, in 100 degree weather, and your walking or running quite a lot. Sometimes you wont get much sleep, and food. You get real dirty. In combat there are no bathroom breaks, so you either hold it in for a while, or you just let it out in an empty MRE bag. or just let it out anywhere,lol. seriously though.    also, it can be very tense. you never know when bullets are gonna start flying, so your always on alert. also you could never know what is an IED or not.|`|1c4baeb727d7819a17c91f84ced0959baa	On deployments you are not doing a 9-5 job you are a doing a 24-7 job.  Most of the time there are no days off, and little sleep.  You eat sleep and breath outside the wire.  You see and do things that pogs only dream of.  You get little to no alone time, you get constantly shot at.  Your meal are mostly mre or if your smart you brought canned food.  You have to constantly keep up with maintenance, you are always alert and it becomes nerve wracking, you get called to do anything and everything.  You are the military's jocks.  On the plus side you get to see the real Iraq/Afghanistan/Egypt/Bosnia, you get to work directly with the people and you get to travel, and when you retire you have real stories to tell unlike the fobbits who never leave the wire.     At home you are either training or ******* off.  Most of the time when I was back in the US we would do PT in the morning and and be dismissed till late afternoon for final formation.  When you do train, you train.  Not that deployments train up bullshit that most support units go through.      Overall I would say being infantry is a great experience.  You have more cohesion and team work than anywhere else and you learn to take care of the man beside you.  Not to mention that you will go places most people only dream of, and see the real problems that are happening in the world.  If you want too really experience what it's like i suggest you start out as enlisted and then become an officer later.  Just be prepared to have longs days, little to no contact back home, and lots of nerve wracking experiences.

lHJlwuqBaa	I'm quite upset that we Republicans allowed the libs and the Drive-by Media to select John McCain as our Presidential Candidate in 2008!  The best conservative candidates in 2008 were: Fred Thompson, Mitt Romney and Mike Huckabee, in that order.  Our party needs to get back to its conservative roots, including limited government, fiscal restraint and evangelical and pro-life values.  Many have said we need to move toward the political center; but this is completely wrong!  We need to move toward the conservative principles of Abraham Lincoln.  Plus, we need to reestablish the principles of our Founding Fathers and restore the original intent of the U. S. Constitution, which limits Federal Government involvement in the private lives of American citizens!  All of these so-called Constitutional lawyers need to read the Federalist Papers authored by Thomas Jefferson, John Jay and Alexander Hamilton and study the actual text of the Constitution!  This would enable them to learn that the only resemblance to the "Separation of Church and State" doctrine is stated verbatim in the First Amendment and puts religious constraints on the Federal Government, *not* on the populace, and that the Tenth Amendment makes it clear that the Federal Government is *not* to be as deeply involved in the personal and private lives of its citizenry, including absolutely *no* involvements in public education!  We do *not* need all these expensive governmental in loco parentis programs which serve mostly line the pockets of the "Fat Cats" inside the Beltway!  If we had term limitations for U. S. Senators and Representatives, they might take better heed as to what laws they pass, because they would have to return to their home State and previous profession and live under the laws and regulations they passed!  Our Founding Fathers did *not* intend for the United States of America to have career politicians!    I am very grateful that not *one* Republican in the House voted for Mr. Obama's bogus economic stimulus package on 01/28/09!|`|4160f1b362be1a382ff4fa170d98797caa	Screw both of them, I'm building a log cabin!|`|5GDAiMysaa	Republicans have been fiscal liberals for 8 years.

Balanced Budget = Good    Budget Deficit = Bad|`|3yXhtBSxaa	It really disturbs me that the Republican Party has moved away from it's traditional values in order to please the religious zealots and other types of neocons who have all but destroyed the party.  We used to have fantastic politicians in the spotlight:  Lincoln, Teddy Roosevelt, Reagan, among many others.  Brilliant progressive conservatives.  The real conservatives, not the Pat Robertson type wack job types who have done their best to overshadow what this party is REALLY all about.    Any old school Republican will tell you that Sarah Palin and her ilk is a disaster.  Gun totin' Teddy would be mortified if he were alive today and saw that twit running around with her "you betchya" garbage.    We need to get back to our roots!|`|U0Rvsabdaa	Sure.

They spend too much  2.  Too many of them are "Powered by Jesus" (some of them have that sticker on their car -- it's a short-term green solution) -- not a good thing if one is to be objective  3.  They don't speak straight -- they've adopted some of the political jargon and it pisses me off.  4.  They play the blame game -- Republicans used to be about accountability...guess you can't be for that game if you're lying and thieving.  5.  They've no spine (at least in the campaign).  They try catering to what people want rather than what's needed.  "Oh you want to tax the rich?  What if your rich boss outsources your job?"  Some of them have lost that cause and effect relationship in their thought process.    However, I do give them credit for standing up to this stimulus bill -- and I hope the Republicans in the senate do as well.  And if Democrats want to vote against it, they'll earn my respect and be dubbed smart Democrats...I know I know...oxymoron, right?  There are indeed thinking Democrats and they better stand up for what's best for this country now.  This isn't good for anyone.|`|flV8NKruaa	I wish the Democrats would stop letting the GOP label them as tax and spend.  Historically, the Republicans have out spent democrats by 284%.  That means for every dollar that is spent during a Democratic administration, the Republicans spend 2.84. Yet, the GOP still calls the Democrats the tax and spend party.    I guess it is better than the borrow and spend more party that the GOP has become.    Don't believe me, look at the link.|`|587533eca4604b2d23fa382dc6204d59aa	I think we should stop letting liberals in.

I think many Republicans who are moving to the left believe we have lost the pop culture to liberalism and liberal ideology and don't believe we can compete with a liberally dominated media and educational system which indoctrinates liberal idea's into their brain from the get go, Therefor they are caving into this by compromising the core principles that make up the Republican party. This is not the answer, What is the answer is for our party to get back to true Ronald Reagan conservatism.  God bless.|`|wQ5LKysaaa	Good grief, Littlelota!

That is why I don't support either party, because we need a balancing act between the two.    That is why I would support Ron Paul for economic and military policy and Bill Clinton for social policy.    But until the republicans get the zealots out (neocons) I will never vote for one, the reason, if anyone still associates themselves with that party, then they support the cancer that has taken over that party and seems, at this point, to be just as strong as ever.

tezszivdaa	it might be conspiracy. did  you know the government gave 38 billion dollars to someone in November. they wouldn't tell the public at all about it.     during George Bush's presidency, was Bush really our president? or was Dick Cheney running things so he can make good profit for his haliburton company?|`|Uaci5YXWaa	Politics is about timing and opportunity.  The Democrats are trying to make the most of their opportunity to get all of the stuff they have not been able to get for the past 8 years.  Their timing is good because they can sell it as helpful for our economic situation and the President is new and so-far unassailable.    It is not foolish stuff.  Its stuff they have wanted for 8 years now but didn't have a chance of getting.  When the economy is in decline, the government should spend and hand out money.  The problem is in getting them to raise taxes and save money when the economy is booming.|`|U3vVGSoKaa	there is a problem with many politicians. Some say they will cut taxes, which stimulates the economy, but like a retailer saying that there is a sale only when, in actuality, they just raised the price, then cut some of it, the politicians will cut the RAISE in taxes.  As far as spending , the stimulus is an attempt to grow government. When government grows, it costs taxpayers more. The more it costs, the less we have.  The less we have, the less rights we have.    Email your congressman not to do anymore bailouts. It takes money out of the hands of private sector folks, you and I,  and puts it into the hands of the largest source of waste there is, the government.    Instead, let companies go bankrupt, someone will buy it!  That what bankruptcy laws, which have succeeded thus far, are for! If the money goes to the government to bail out, they will waste 60% of it, and the  private sector will never have it again.    Government, especially liberal, socialist, progressive, Obam -like governments,  breeds inefficiency and impose restrictions on our freedoms.    Therefore, they should only cut taxes,[with our fingers crossed it is actually a cut], and do nothing more 90% of the time.    Obama is grandstanding, just so he can fulfill his socialist dreams of government being the answer to all of our problems.    Instead, I like what Reagan said. Government is not the answer, government is the problem!|`|hCX1dTuUaa	chill|`|cGWbzf0gaa	idk. its stupid|`|W7iKR944aa	rome was cool though! they had the best orgies|`|xSu5A4eYaa	yeah stupidly they have used billions to try to win the war in Iraq|`|IuTnN5ihaa	the goverment wants money for himself|`|lFPsPzxzaa	who knows because they can i guess|`|oWAUn0leaa	Romans? Seriously dude? It's Keynesian economic theory, and it's proven pretty viable at preventing economic meltdown. We have to save in times of economic prosperity (which GWB didn't do) and spend in times of scarcity. This a time of scarcity so it's time to spend.|`|5vbWDqjNaa	We are a consumer based, borrow and spend economy. Banks are not lending out money (credit), so the government is trying to unfreeze this credit. They are also trying to prevent job loss, which isn't going to happen.    The more money the government prints and spends, the more worthless it becomes.|`|Ikd9cppcaa	Yes. What the Democrats are trying to do is kill the dollar and go to a World Currency. With all this spending frenzy and the dollar printing presses working overtime, it won't be long before no country will accept our dollar for payment.|`|IG8s8UnSaa	I thought pork was cheap.  The kind I eat is.|`|zijJOEXqaa	yes|`|67dWrrH9aa	if your talking about the 800 billion stimulus bailout that passed just today, it is NOT wasting money, it is necessary     our education has been taken 20 billion away from california ALONE, not including other states, which have an acumulative of over 100 billion and the bailout helps education    , the unemployment rate is at 20% [highest so far in 15 years], and     1000s of comapnies go bankrupt every single day    Yes, it is alot of money, but it's better in the long run.|`|LROaxvV8aa	They want to make us feel wanted.|`|tyvFUPOxaa	First of all, you are right--we are falling like the Roman Empire. But we have the benefit of being educated masses--the Roman masses and slaves were not educated. Thus, we can read history books and learn to prevent what happened in the Roman Empire--from happening here.    And, you nearly identified the sources of our decline. The Romans became so lazy and infatuated with their gladiators, orgies, and other luxuries that they became apathetic about politics and they could care less that Germanic people were invading Rome--like illegal Mexicans are invading the USA today. This reads like the USA--today.    But, I do not think the American people are wasting as much money as we are being accused of wasting. However, the international bankers and the constituents of the previous President and US Congress are selling us out for very obvious personal profit; and they are exploiting the Americans like the Caesars exploited the Romans.    We need to educate ourselves and force our leadership to represent us or face the consequences for their failures and transgressions against us.|`|97b5127ddddc7a556167788c3c948831aa	wheres my shoes?|`|aN1oaCStaa	Hey, when in Rome.|`|Ii3Cd5OOaa	They are wasting as much of your money as they can get away with.

k2BwHXmyaa	he likes gun bans because he is a tree hugging liberal that thinks if you ban guns it will all be peaceful here and violence will dissolve.  it's as simple as that.  i live in IL, the suburbs of chicago, and i have 3 guns (2 handguns, 1 rifle).  handguns are banned in chicago, yet they have one of the highest handgun crime rates.  why? not because of people like me owning guns, but because of the black market.  what these liberal pansies (not all democrats, just the hardcore ones) dont understand is that the best way to get gun violence to go away is to make tougher penalities for breaking the law in the first place, not make more laws that bad guys will ignore anyways.  stricter DUI laws doesnt stop drunk driving, but when there is a year of jail attached to a DUI offense, that will get the message accross.  and also i bet obama has never shot a gun or been to a firing range, and you know the old saying "you fear what you do not know."|`|Ng3GcFX6aa	!@ $%      A GUN  !|`|ukBX5OOsaa	I wish guns were completely banished, however, that's not going to happen, so might as well let everyone have a gun, if someone has one, then you need one to protect yourself and it leads to a vicious cycle.|`|HRvPoQzKaa	If he ever makes a "NO Gun" law, I'll be pretty pissed.|`|AA11148986	No, you're paranoid.

Especially since money will be going overseas.  Birth control sure doesn't work here amongst our more liberal colleagues. They consider abortion a "viable" form of birth control.

ZaFreVDhaa	it's worse then murder.     When you hurt a child, you steal our future. That child will (almost) never live up to his true potentail.     I think it's terorism on different level, to terrorize the children also hurts our future more then what a mere terrorist can do. It should be delt with as such. I'm usally PC, but not on this topic.     I just don't understand why our laws are so leinent on them. I guess it just goes back to children being historically "property" (did you know an organzation for protecting animals was founded before one for protecting children? Shame.)|`|AA12229118	Unfortunately, its a balancing act... Child molesters and sexual predators of all kind, are still citizens, and therefore, have to be entitled to proper laws and humane treatment. Of course, that's not to say we shouldn't have more strict punishment for them. I'm thinking a system much like house arrest. Perhaps a chip or an ankle bracelet with GPS tracking. Parents could then track sexual predators, no matter where they live, work, or spend "recreational" time. Also an extensive data base to house all of the information on these individuals. I think the results would be much more informative to concerned parties, and be fair to offenders.|`|ff4620d7ef5c56f9405c2f52615552f5aa	I think they should be donated to science, so that hopefully a cure for such a sick mind may be found.|`|JI7NQ9TNaa	Why would Alaska want them?|`|OpqUaHtsaa	i agree with penny proud there that is one of the sickest things ever in the world there...or either just let them rot in a hole in the ground.|`|LjyfQZdwaa	In my opinion, I think they have had too much time on their hands and have wasted valuable time just to find ways to prey on innocent children and many of tax dollars are spent keeping them fed and alive in prison/medical assessment/s etc...perhaps when government are seeking to recruit for the army/navy...etc they could begin in the over crowded jails and ship them off somewhere.

2a8e61bed9f388aedbc1d7ebf6a768eaaa	The only things that I have really agreed with from what I have been reading on it are    1: I am glad that part of it is supposed to go to help people that have  been let go from their jobs and are having trouble finding work. I would be scared to death if my family lost their income and I had to worry about my kids eating and having trouble being able to make sure I could support their needs.    Now there will be people who choose not to work and will probably benefit from this too, but there are people who take advantage.    2: I like the money going towards fixing our roads, bridges and things like that, I do think that will help create jobs.( although not to keen on the states getting that money and getting to dole it out. I do not have much faith in my state government at all!!!!!)    3: I like the fact that they are giving money to education. Alot of public schools that aren't in the "rich" parts of towns could use more teachers so their classrooms aren't so packed that they can't always get to all the kids, and another benefit is that the youth that will one day take over will get a better education.      I do agree with you though. I am not asking for another check like with Bush. It has gotten so hard for my family that after we pay all our bills that are keep our house running, ( cable/internet is our one luxury) and groceries and gas that we are literally shocked if we have any money left over.    I think that it is crap that the package has all freaking kinds of money for the arts, and science and other things like that. I do not believe that sinking all kinds of money into things like that is going to help now at all.  By all means later on try to pass that crap later when the nation isn't sinking, but as for now I think that it needs to only have in it plans that will help the citizens that need it. NOT JUST THE LOWER CLASS, UPPER CLASS, OR JUST THE FREAKING BUSINESSES.    Anyways, that's just my piece, and for all you ignorant people who say Obama is ruining us,or it's just the liberals, we didn't just start hurting on Jan. 20th.|`|zEVpA4WCaa	PORK PORK PORK AND MORE PORK !!!!!

But instead, they want to spend it on useless items like climate protection and global warming. Last time I looked outside, the massive amounts of snow and freezing temps had me quaking in my boots for billions to fix that pesky warming trend. What could be done is save the money and put it toward non service sector jobs that can promote allot of job growth. Re-open manufacturing plants around the country and re-employ millions of Americans.

Remember, all in the name of saving jobs, and saving Americas economy  Page 41: The Coast Guard wants more than $572 million for Acquisition, Construction, & Improvements They claim these funds will create 1,235 new jobs.

Page 32: $1.5 billion (with a B) for a carbon-capturing contest    This plan is the old-style pork-barrel spending -- not stimulus:    ? $6 billion for colleges/universities -- many which have billion-dollar endowments.  ? $166 billion in direct aid to states -- many of which have failed to budget wisely.  ? $50 million in funding for the National Endowment of the Arts.  ? $44 million for repairs to U.S. Department of Agriculture headquarters.  ? $200 million for the National Mall, including grass planting.    House Democrats plan will cost each household $16,700 in debt, which will be paid for by our children and grandchildren.

I had said they should give the one trillion to the IRS, as the IRS takes up to 60 cents to collect each dollar, so the trillion would be like $1.60 trillion, then allow the Congress to put it out as pork and projects.  A highway employs 5,000 they have said, but I don't know.  But this way the stuff could be put out like normal ways.  Maybe it will be put out for bids, don't know, but if it turns ot like the CEO of Merrill Lynch who spent $1.22 million to renovate his office then it will be a mess.  He hired William (forget his last name,but the same decorator that Barrack and Michele have hired to do the White House), of Los Angeles to do the renovations, the guy spent $843,000 for antiques, includihg a $34,000 legged toilet.  So I am sure the guy put his 15% on top or more and then no telling what he charged to do the "designing" and then i assume the rest went to workers, but not sure if that would even be $100,000.      So I would hope that htey make sure the jobs are not "cost plus" where the copany can charge 100% for everything they spend, which is what Halliberton does.  i am sure that the money to us poor people will be immediately put in the hopper.    This is way over my head and hope it saves the economy, i will leave it to you guys to figure out.

Obama can suspend Bush's tax cuts that are suppose to run out next year, and Obama will, be ready to pay more taxes than you have in your life.

Not 100% sure of this, but i heard trying to get into Ranger indoc program is a lot harder to get into , than just enlisting into the opt.40 contract.  so if you want, you could enlist in opt.40, which means....you go to basic training, then your MOS training, then airborne, then ranger indoc program. (RIP).  if you pass Rip, you will be assigned to one of the Ranger battalions, then after 6-12 months, you will go to ranger school, so you can take up a leadership role in the ranger regiment.  or you can enlist, try to get airborne, because it will help trying to get into ranger training because you would all ready be airborne qualified, and just serve in a regular army unit till you think your ready, then you can apply for ranger indoc.    but really, this is all up to you.  if you think you can take the training, then i Say go for it!  but if you have some doubt,then maybe you should just enlist and work it out till you think you have what it takes.  just sit down and think it out!  Rangers are fit. Just start getting your physical confidence up alright.|`|yLQ2rUHnaa	hit the rangers straight out of the gate. the regiment breeds its own, which means:the longer you wait the harder it is. rangers teach you how to be a ranger, the army teaches you how to be army. the pipeline is like this. BCT/AIT for 11B-Jump School(BAS)-Ranger Indoctrination Program-75th Ranger Regiment. prepare now. to be competitive you need to do at least 13:00minutes on your 2 mile time, 6 pullups,80 pushups,80 situps. that is the ranger standard. you gotta be ready to eat **** and grin about it. go straight, find a ranger buddy that will PT with you. dont let the recruiter **** you either tell him that you want Option 40 or nothing at all.RLTW|`|GxeSTBKkaa	Yes indeed you should wait. The ranger school is ungodly hard and makes marines look like wimpy girl scouts. You need to be in supreme physical condition and alot of it is mental as well. It's pretty intense dude. I think there is still a video of all of the training posted on you tube. I'm no slouch and I can tell you right now I wouldn't make it through ranger school. Don't wait too long either or you'll be too old. Most people wait 4-7 yrs after being in the infantry. Good luck to you.
86bdee7210e024dfe5c8dc94b917c424aa	Exactly what number does there need to be in order for you to be happy? What's your quota?    Back in 1991, retiring Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall -- the first black Justice -- was asked whether or not he thinks it is appropriate for the President to appoint another black person to replace Marshall himself. He said no, it doesn't matter what is the race of the new appointee replacing him. "A snake can be white or black but it is still a snake, see?"|`|21Wk2mu5aa	It is because there aren't that many blacks who run for congress and there are very few who inspire the black voters to vote as Obama did.     There aren't very many women, either.     No way on the quota for ten percent. The government officials must be elected by the people. Implementing a quota goes against our whole democracy.      I think we will see an increase of blacks in congress in the future.|`|AA12191521	they make up 13% of the population. But not 13% of the congressional districts. Black people are not all grouped together in the same place. They live all over the place. Many in districts that are mostly white. But there are some districts in large cities with African-American majorities. And those districts often elect Black representatives. While the racial majority in any district is likely to be the same as its representative, anyone of any race can run in any district. If they can appeal to the voters they can win. The race of a candidate should not matter. It still does to some people. But it shouldn't. You want to make things better, quit worrying about what race members of congress are and just try to elect competent people regardless of ethnicity.|`|ynlft41Uaa	No, unless you want the country to look like South Africa.

If they don't have $40, how are they paying utilities?    Besides, Verizon and AT&T have paid billions of dollars to obtain broadcast licenses for these frequency ranges, and emergency services across the US is required to implement a solution for better emergency services communication in the event of a disaster or terrorist attack, they are required by law to do this, and the best frequency spectrum to host this service is currently occupied by antiquated analog TV broadcasts.    The government originally wanted to do this in 2000, it has been postponed many times and now it's almost 10 years.  It's time to move on and implement a planned change.  I understand Obama's concern, but this was debated in the 110th congress, of which he was a member, and his own party determined the dollar amount to fund the coupons for converters program; they ignored Republicans when they told them it was too little, and they reap what they sow now.|`|oBL3AtRfaa	They've KNOWN they had to convert for AT LEAST a year now. It's not as if this was a big secret! And it's NOT expensive. These people have had AGES to convert.     If all the carriers necessary to the conversion had FINALLY agreed on a given plan, how much will it cost them to abandon the plan that EVERYBODY KNEW about? Do you know what it *took* for all of them to finally get on the same page? It's like herding cats.    Obama is again overreaching, and over something trivial. I'm afraid we're going to see a lot more of that unless he starts acting like a President instead of a busybody.|`|9qJPfpRpaa	I fail to understand the problem with the TV converter business.

pXlY8eoNaa	I know this thread is becoming just an excuse for people to insert their partisan opinions. I'll try to address your question more directly.    Colbert briefly tried to run for president as a Democrat in South Carolina, but the Democratic Party didn't allow him on the ballot.    When Obama won the South Carolina primary, some observers believe that cemented his road to the nomination, even though Hillary remained on the ticket for several months afterward and continued to win large states.    If Colbert had been on the ballot, it could have reduced Obama's chances of winning. Probably most Colbert fans are hardcore liberals who would otherwise vote for Obama. Still, in my humble opinion, I don't think it would have made that big a difference in the end. Obama's lead over Hillary Clinton was not close (a gap of about 30 percentage points), and the amount of people who would have chosen Colbert over Obama was probably small.    In short, Colbert theoretically could have cost Obama the nomination and the presidency, though I don't happen to think it made much of a difference.|`|yKcfbN9Daa	Nope. He owes it to uneducated americans and people too lazy to actually research what the candidates want. His smooth talking got him the presidency. Go buy some obama playing cards in stores now!! Obama didnt even finish his first term as senator. AND - Chicago has more murders per month than military soldiers death in iraq. qualified my @$$...

33ppbrMJaa	Yes. They would rather see Americans suffer and send our country even further down the tubes than vote with Obama in a bold and decisive Stimulus Package that he talked about during his Campaign and won the approval of a majority of American voters. They will cause more Americans to lose jobs and more Americans to lose their homes, while they play partisan political games.  Their behavior is reprehensible.    They have been so partisan that it is easy to see that Obama's pleas for Unity are falling short of ever becoming a reality.  For eight years, they passed EVERY tremendous spending bill that George W. Bush asked for, without complaint, without question.  Their Party approved and supported $10 billion weekly expenditures for Iraq, until our Treasury was completely looted of its money and we had to borrow money and create money in order to survive. From the richest country in the world, we have become a battered Debtor Nation.    Now, they pretend to be worried about Obama's Stimulus, a huge package intended to create jobs and correct our problems with our Infrastructure.  It is a shame when our politicians are willing to spend billions and billions to reconstruct Iraq, but balk at spending money to rebuild America.  I just hope voters remember this at the next Election! I think they will!|`|YbEJgvHMaa	The Republic party is a failed party.

Nothing in the plan encourages students to study harder. There is an increase in college graduates and high school graduates when military research jobs are created, or when NASA has more satellite orders and other projects.|`|8pt0fYPOaa	Fail at what?

When consume confidence goes bad, they don't spend.  I'll tell you what, putting money in people's pockets is a great way to get them to spend it.  Tax cuts will work, I like the Republican proposals to slash taxes for the lower classes.  Many of them risk foreclosure or defaulting on loans; slashing their taxes will make this less likely from happening.  Stemming foreclosures and loan defaults is a great thing for our economy right now.    "HOW COME BUSH'S TAX CUT DIDN'T HELP THE ECONOMY??  ALSO HOME COME BILL CLINTON LEFT A SURPLUS WHEN HE LEFT OFFICE??"    Just as Clinton was leaving office, the economy started falling apart.  Clinton handed Bush a recession.  When there's a recession, things get bad, doing things that help don't necessarily negate the things that make it bad, but they do make it less worse.  Bush's first 5 years in office had positive job growth, not a great amount, but growth nonetheless.  The economy was still growing then, I consider that a healthy functioning economy.    Also... Clinton never left a surplus, it was a projected surplus, it was projected before thing started getting bad at the end of Clinton's term.  Our treasury never had positive dollars in it, and our debt never even reached 0, and if you don't believe me, you can go to the US treasury website, you can find a time when it had money in it, and you can show it to me and I'll eat my words.

5rXzu0IWaa	It will help. The enemy now is deflation. Since all of that money got taken out of the economy by the mortgage debacle now we have to worry about deflation. If you read manufacturing company's year end reports you see that they are reporting the price of materials are going down.     When we have deflation people put off buying things until later because it will be cheaper. Which causes people to make fewer things and hire few people. Which makes people afraid to spend.     We need some inflation so that people will buy things again so that they will not have to pay more later. Which will cause people to make more things and hire more people.

4b28c8d6c4701c9b0210498b25f2c3faaa	It is not a 100% stimulus package.  It is much more than just that.  The name of it is:  American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.    The tax cut part of it will jump start the economy as long as the taxpayers that receive the tax cuts spend the extra money instead of hording it or paying off credit card debt.  It has the potential to inject over $1.5 billion per week into the economy.    The unemployment benefit extension part of it will also help jump start the economy because those that would receive that will be putting it right back into the economy.    The extra funds for food stamps and medicaid part will also help jump start the economy.    The infrastructure part will not be an immediate boost but will be a medium term stabilizer, a much needed repair to our crumbling infrastructure and a move towards energy independence.      Bush's tax cuts didn't work because they were mostly directed at those that didn't need tax cuts.  Obama's tax cuts are directed at people that do need them, its just a matter of how they spend them as to how much good they will do.    The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act is a good thing but more needs to be done like raising the top income tax rate to 70%.  In 1918, congress raised the top income tax rate to 77%, that led to a booming economy in the 1920s.  In 1925 congress lowered the top income tax rate to 25%, that led to a recession that started in 1929 which led to the great depression.  The downward spiral did not reverse until after congress raised the top tax rate to 63% in 1932 and FDR's New Deal in 1933.    History shows us that whenever the top income tax rate has been high, the economy and job growth have always expanded, while when the top income tax rate has been cut, it has led to stagnant economic and job growth.|`|LiC73eggaa	It needs more pork, so we can feed the people.|`|zuqv3qR1aa	A stimulus package is simply a bandage for a much bigger wound and even Obama knows this...What our government is going through right now is what simply happens in a Capitalist society.

Some on the right are screaming their heads off about it at the moment,     But then again, when Bush's bailout was hung up in Congress this board was full of right wingers demanding that democrats stop obstructing that essential economic measure.

I don't think giving everybody $1,000 to patch up their finances for another month is going to pull the economy out of it.  If anything, it will only make things worse because of the inflation and additional debt load the country will take because of it.

So guess what? We all are going to get taxed after this stimulus plan temporarily works.  The public works programs he is suggesting that is going to create 1.2 milliion jobs is going to be funded how?  And that wont even start until 2011.  We have issues facing us folks.  Nobody has the magic bullet to stop this.  Its greed that started it.  We are paying for it.  Obama wants to spend in one swoop of the pen what GWB spent in 4 yrs.  I am not slamming the guy, just sayin that all this rhetoric about to much gov spending and what are we doing?  I have alot to lose if the auto industry goes under, but, I realize that the free enterprise system is a risky business.  If it happens, I lose big and its more than I can really afford to lose but its part of the game.  And at this point, we started a bailout snowball that really wont stop until the gov owns every major industry in one way or another.

It has been demonstrated and proven that for every dollar given in tax cuts, only $1.03 worth of economic activity is created.    That's a whopping 3 cents worth of economic growth. The government spends more than that just on the paper the checks are printed on.    When it comes to corporate tax cuts, for every dollar we give in corporate tax cuts, only 70 cents worth of economic acitivty is generated. That is a net LOSS of 30 cents.    And amazingly enough, for every dollar the government spends on Food Stamps, we generate $1.75 of economic growth and activity.       But I guess Republicans are concerned more with idealology than actual numbers and math.|`|65OG0ZHaaa	Very creative distortion of a bible verse. But if you were truly familiar with these passages, you would see that Jesus instructed his followers to help the poor.  Which you'll notice is being done as conservatives out donate liberals quite handily.

But that isn't happening, is it?|`|G7SiH0ohaa	Yeah poor and middle class people need the cuts more than rich people. They should stop being selfish bastards.

al8PapTXaa	Peace is not founded on a lack of problems between people but on the efforts of people to implement a multitude of solutions.  The trick is convincing people that there is value in seeking peace.  They need motivation to love one another.    Peace is acheived through mutual love between people.  Love is the desire to understand another and to give what you perceive is truly needed and not necessarily what the receiver wants.  This type of love can be healthy or codependant.  An example of codependant love is when a person of a certain religion decides that everyone else in the world must believe in his religion or die... because killing them will be a means of attonement for their soul (ie your killing them is good for their soul) and creates less resistance of the spread the "true" religion.  Not all religions are founded on this concept but there are a few that are...  I won't continue down this road now.    War is a tool and like any tool it can be used for "good" or for "bad".  Whether the tool of war is a good thing or a bad thing comes down to one's definition of good and bad.    Scenario 1: If good is maximizing the profits of corporations and raiding the natural resources of another country and enslaving a population by forcing a country to take World Bank loans and strangling them with interst payments, and if bargaining and bribing the leaders of that country doesn't lead to them selling out their country, then war is a good thing.    The problem with this first scenario is that it is the main true reason for many of today's wars.  War has become a business tool all too much in today's society and people need to be educated in this regard to try and curb this issue.  The problem is that the few who control the education systems and the media in this world are under the thumbs of corporations and labor unions who are motivated by self preservation rather than loving others.    Scenario 2: If you feel that preservation of yourself and those you love is not worth fighting for when others who have decided that you and all who you love need to die, then war is a bad thing.    The problem with the second scenario is the false belief that war and peace are opposites... Peace is a state of being... war is a tool.  They are two entirely different concepts.  You can have a lack of peace and a lack of love and a lack of war all at once.      Scenario 3: If good is self preservation and wanting to give to others (your family, friends, community, etc.) what you perceive they need, and a group of people gather together to kill you and/or those you love and after making extreme concertive efforts this "enemy" is not willing to negoiate nor work towards peace, war is a good solution.    The problem with this last scenario is that people too often don't use enough intelligent creativity nor put in enough efforts to avert war.  We are too quick to pull the trigger.      Is it possible to fight and kill people you love?  If you believe in the concept of preservation of yourself and those you love, sometimes, in order to save the majority of whom you love from the minority of whom you love... war is the only option.  This can only happen when the minority either lack love or are infected with codependant love.  The problem is that war is basically committed through acts of indifference or outright hatred and not, as bizarre as this might sound, through love.    If you read this far and understood what I wrote, congratulations...  The question you raised has been answered by numerous authors over thousands of years.  I could write on this subject for the rest of my life and not have stated everything that needs to be stated.|`|70DZWz2Baa	Quite possibly he will. In 2012 during the second coming he will cleanse the world of all evil(bye liberals(not saying conservatives are all angels). I am just saying that it might happen.

The Muslim Religion though it seems peaceful it is anything but.  There has been people converted at gun point.  our nation has been at war with Muslim extremists since the 1970s.  This form of religion is a very violent religion.  Unlike most others.  Like when an European newspaper printed a political cartoon as a joke some Muslims took offense in a violent way. which is quite absurd.  So i think different religions is a problem with international peace|`|i5F2jwvhaa	as long as there are different religions there will never be peace    Its the way its always been, its the way it will remain until humans die off
h6c0qGwaaa	I am not a legal immigrant but was chucked by those that answered for them. If your accepting answers from those that are not legal immigrants then may I reply to one analogy of cutting lines.  When I worked at South Port Plaza, a theater there (Tinseltown) there were many movies that people camped out to see. Upon the doors opening it was found that people with credit cards had already bought up tickets in lots of five and ten for their family and friends to attend these movies. Is it fair that because these people have finances available to them that they could purchase these tickets in advance in the comfort of their homes and that those who had worked and saved to buy them now wait in open air lines overnight are limited to buying what is available at  "the door"?  It is similar in nature of immigration, those that are coming in illegally are generally the poor worker with nothing more than what they can carry. While those that apply and wait years have some sort of financial support or savings which makes a difference when deciding if crossing illegally or applying and waiting.  Please do not read my words as supporting crossing in the middle of the night but more as I stated when I first said, I am chuckled by those that answered for them.|`|xagIY1Quaa	P O'd.  Who can blame them--and wouldnt you be?    Here's an analogy for you.  You wait in line to see a new movie, just released, that you've been waiting and wanting to see for a very long time.  You patiently wait in line, you wait your turn, and you use your hard earned money to buy your ticket.    Then you enter the theatre only to discover that some hooligans entered through the back door, propped it open, and let all their hooligan friends in for free, not waiting their turn, not paying the price of the ticket, and then occupying the seats in the theatre....while you--who did it the right way -- now no longer has the place your rightfully waited for and earned.    It sucks.  And that's how legal immigrants feel.|`|f3pRhrAdaa	That's like asking how do rapist like having their mothers raped?|`|G4TJ8nibaa	I'd say ask my wife but I don't want her to get that p!ssed off right now!

You Legal Immigrants  have to stand up for the u.s.a. otherwise why    did you come here for? Please spare me the bull.|`|5HYabirzaa	They don't mind at all!

He knows some people that wrote him on his mission and they live in the States now.  They came over illegally and got amnesty a while back.  It's really hard to see things like that happen because they have a nice car and a nice house and they're on every program known to the US and we are struggling very hard to just stay afloat and put my hubby through school.  It's quite distressing really.  He's here as a resident and we had to pay big $$ to get it that way before his student visa expired.|`|4xpXoG5Oaa	They should not feel anything bad because in the first place the legal immigrants are not coming here to do the kind of jobs that illegals are doing. Illegals are not cutting in line. If SOME legal immigrants are feeling bad, maybe envy, then they can do the same as illegal immigrants and stop complaining, or envying,and start doing jobs for minimal salary. I bet they don't want to do that.

026b1934d4ff58e232cc4b419808adc4aa	With generalities like this, don't expect too many kind words from Americans here. However ignorant your question seems to be, let me try to explain.    It all started with the founding of our nation. Or founding fathers wanted the average citizen to be able to defend themselves in case our government ever turned against its people. That was why the second amendment was written into our constitution.    As far as Afghanistan went, people forgot why we were there. We told the Taliban government to hand over Osama bin Laden to us. They did not, so we over threw their government and we have been trying to stabilize it ever since.     Iraq was unfortunately a war of choice. Bush figured that he could create a large sphere of influence in the region, get cheap oil, and I suspect have a little payback for attempts by Saddam Hussein against his father's life.     As far as our states and the gun laws, every state controls who can have guns. I will offer this to you. There are so many guns in the nation, the only thing a gun ban or extremely strict gun laws will do is hurt law abiding citizens in getting guns. The average criminal doesn't get their gun from a gun shop. It is gotten on the street, where gun regulations mean nothing.     Americans don't want war and to 'win over' places. Unfortunately, that is what happens when you are a superpower. Our interests are so far reaching, that we get dragged into conflicts. I wish the world ran on sunshine and unicorns, but it doesn't.|`|HpJ4wwC7aa	"all"? I'm an American and I'm not all into guns and wars.

My boyfriend and I find gun possession purposeless, and it creates other worse situations than simply being safe and taking care.     As for war, I understand it's necessary at it's points, but no war will ever be my war.|`|MEReSvZeaa	Why are Europeans all into hiding under their beds while violent men overrun your own neighborhoods?    Do you have no self-respect?|`|ff4620d7ef5c56f9405c2f52615552f5aa	I don't have a problem with guns (why not protect yourself instead of just hoping the authorities make it to your rescue in time?), but I do have a problem with illegal wars.|`|ea207ed5b6ef75b8f1362932a6abf174aa	They arent.      There are banks that give guns for opening an account?  Where?  Source please.  Never heard of that.|`|mdHqr17kaa	why does it bother you if I have a gun, unless you plan to make war on me?|`|fKFvzlzQaa	Your premise is false.    Americans are not into guns and war.    Americans are realistic.    Americans believe in effective self defense when we are attacked as in the attacks on the world Trade Center Towers in September 11, 2001.    Americans see guns as useful tools, similar to a knife and fork for putting food on the table, cars for transportation, guns as useful tools for self defense against rapists, robbers and muggers, and guns also are seen as tools similar to a saw, a hammer of a wrench.    the people who make a big issue about guns are the radical left who would deny all people the use of guns as tools.    You would also get a strong negative response if you tried to ban knives and forks, cars, and saws, hammers and wrenches.
XoAwzQ5Yaa	Cadaver dogs usually sniff out rotting tissue. In a case where it's been 60 years, any soft tissue that has been left has probably decomposed and has been absorbed into the ground. Usually dogs can find things up to about 20 years (and it takes a really good dog to get that). You might be better off contacting the police, or the state police. They have an instrument that works like a sonar, that can view underground, so see if an area has been disturbed (without ripping your house apart).

6nS62bB8aa	You would have to gather several different perspective to gain a complete answer. I can only get you started.    You would need to look at  philosophical, religious, economic, and even psychological perspectives. Each perspective can offer arguments both for and against socialism.    In my little brain though, it comes down to this: What is the best way to run a government? That's the question which humanity has been asking itself since we first formed societies, cultures, and governments.     Now that I read all this, I think that I just made things worse for you. But still, I can't resist the urge to participate.

At most, they've had a nominal majority but never enough to break a filibuster so NOTHING happens without Democrat cooperation.  Now, play a little "what if" game. Look at the budget votes over the 2 Bush terms and separate out DNC and GOP votes. What do you see?  With DNC only, you have about 4 times the spending we actually did.  With GOP only you have LESS spending than we actually did.  So allow me to reiterate: Want a surplus? Stop voting for Democrats. It really IS that simple.    Oh. You would think a real fan of Clinton's would have been listening to him on his way out the White House door. In those waning days, his administration confessed they had cooked the books and had NOT left a surplus; rather they had busted the budget wide open. Bush's budgets "grew" that deficit by LESS than the amount spent on the war. Of course, Congress over-spent his budgets . . . .|`|O1Unx5RUaa	they used it all to pay off Halliburton and their homies in wall street|`|YbEJgvHMaa	If you look to recent history Reagan, Bush 1, and The Dumb One have all left us with larger deficits.

It is customized by the various countries.  We have Social Democracy.  As we learn by experience, it evolves and improves itself.
PI8VfiY1aa	Well, believing in aliens is one thing, but believing in UFO's is kind of a necessity. John Carver Meadows Frost was the man behind "Project Y" and "Project Y2", the first attempt to build a saucer-shaped aircraft for the U.S. Air Force in the 50's. It was a disaster though and the project was scrapped- apparently he was able to achieve lift and control, but it was incredibly difficult to pilot. It's only boring old history though. No spacecraft here?    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Carver...    So I guess the point is that you can give the UFO believers more credit than the Bush supporters because at least the UFO believers have history on their side.    ----EDIT----    Did you know that the Freedom of Information Act had much of this declassified? Check out this declassified report from 1955- It's a plethora of information from the Air Force    http://www.cufon.org/cufon/Silverbug.pdf|`|BkatcMZbaa	In this situation & urgency.....everyone is more concerned with the uncertain needed happening & outcome than the for sure happening and outgoing type.

I personally believe that the possibility of an alien culture exists. Could this the reason Bigfoot is never seen, perhaps?   We really do think quite a lot of ourselves if we believe the rest of the universe is vacant, and we are the only sentient planet.  Think of it this way ... we are consumed by learning about all that is surrounding us. Why wouldn't an alien culture? Maybe they are just checking out the beautiful view, on vacation or just going to the zoo.   Maybe they are curious.   Why is the idea of aliens kept hush hush? I guess, because before Columbus explored North America ...   Why do we assume it would be a bad thing?  Former pres. Bush made a lot of mistakes. We do not easily forgive.   peace

To be fair as much as I disapproved of Bush myself, you are only looking at the negatives. He's also the President who has provided the largest aid to 3rd world nations compared to any other Presidents. Though I do believe he's done more wrong than right, but however unpopular he may have been, he wasn't all bad during his presidential run.     Also most people misconstrue some facts. People mistakenly associates Bush as the main culprit to the downfall of the economy, but the government regulations that triggered this downfall started before his presidential terms. Sure you could argue he didn't handle the stock market crash well, but he did NOT trigger it.     However you were referring to the national debt itself, then yes I agree he did bring this country down into a much deeper debt, that goes hand in hand with the War in Iraq as it costs a lot to fund this war.    But to answer your question, if Sarah Palin had ran 8 years ago, there is no doubt she would have taken the same course, she is extremely conservative and supported Bush's war efforts. But it is hard to compare the two, because one was a President and one wasn't. But the fact remains she and Bush are more of the same, except Bush would have had much more experience and comes from a family who's main man was the President himself, George H.W Bush, if both had ran at the same time for presidency Bush would have a stronger case for President.    Yet, remember, everything Bush did wrong, the preceding Presidents will have that chance to avoid those mistakes and learn from them. So if Palin had become president instead of Obama or Mccain, she would probably have had the chance to overturn some of Bush's mistakes, and make her look much better in comparison. After all, Bush brought himself into a position where anyone who runs for President next, will automatically make Bush look pale in comparison.    But thank God we elected, Obama, right?

AA12212403	He's trying to befriend them, I think.  I don't think they will fall for that.  It shows how naive he truly is.  They will listen to what he says in an effort to try this friendship thing, while planning a full fledged bio-terror attack here that could destroy our water supply, subways, etc. with millions dead in one day.  Then, they will say we were asking for it.  He will eliminate the wire tapping and things that have allowed us to find out about things ahead and stop them, so we'll be sitting ducks.  Just say your prays and hope that your family is not out there in the world when this horror is unleashed upon us.    As far as him not caring about what Republicans think, you can bank on that.  Look at this stimulus package, not ONE republican vote from what I saw last night on the news.  He's going to stomp on us and grind us into the pavement with his heel.  But, I do think that will backfire on him.  Particularly if his policies fail, as republicans will surely be able to say that they were not for any of this.    But, with the very liberal agenda that is on the new WH-gov web site, lots who voted for him are going to be shocked at what he wants to do.  He's going to have lots of explaining to do.  I, for one, will not stop voicing my concerns, at least until he puts me in jail for it.  This may come sooner than you think.    So, if you are a Catholic Hospital and refuse to do abortions if it's against your religion, he may put you in jail and at the very least stop all federal funding and force you into either closing or doing what goes against your faith.    If you are in a state, like CA, that voted no for gay marriages and you are angry, rejoice as he wants to remove the law that Clinton (who looks like a conservative in comparison with Mr. O) put in place and take away individual states rights to decide on gay marriages for themselves.  We'll all be forced into it regardless of what people truly want.  Put it to a vote, Mr. Obama, please.  Just like CA, you will see that a vast majority have opinions.  If it wins, then implement, don't enforce your views on us all.      If you are a photographer and do not want to take photos at a gay marriage ceremony, because it goes against your beliefs, you can be fined and thrown in jail.    Your free speech will be taken away as if you protest, even peacefully, with signs and nothing more about gays or their marriages, you could spend as much as 40 years in jail.  What happened to free speech and freedom of assembly?  If it goes against his views and what he and Pelosi want, you can say goodbye.  If Rush Limbaugh speaks out about it, he'll be forbidding people to listen, yet again, and finally will make efforts to pull him off the air.    Let me close by saying that I personally have nothing against gays and have a live and let live attitude.  I'm more for civil unions, though.  I just want to make some points, here, there are basic freedoms and liberties that he plans on tampering with.   These changes are so "out there" and I think they go further than what those who voted for this man may have wanted.    I think, if my faith has me believing that gays shouldn't be married that only a man and woman be married that maybe I could say no to working on a wedding and it should be my right to do so without going to jail?  It's my faith, right?|`|28tF5NOMaa	I am honestly concerned that our president is going to become known as a terrorist sympathizer to the world.

I love your idea of PLEASING Republicans (lol) Guess what??? He is YOUR president too, so you better learn to deal with it. He doesnt need to impress you, but he needs to send a message to our former enemies (according to Bush) in order to solidify a safer nation for us and our children.

AA10742996	DOn't expect to see much. It's all tied to pork projects.    Facts:    $819 Billion dollar stimulus plan will provide 3 million new jobs over the next 5 years. 819 Billion / 3 million = $273,000. I'm sure those jobs won't pay that much!    Why not just divide that money with every American. There are 300 Million Americans which means every man, woman and child living in the US would get $2,730 each. Now thats stimulus!|`|21Wk2mu5aa	Your husband is right. It will be a check. You should of gotten one last year with Pres. Bush's stimulus plan except it was $600-$1200 instead of $500-$1000.     You are right about your assumption that it would be coming with tax returns.     Your example about owing $800 and having only paid $600 is logical but incorrect. You would still have to pay the $200 when you file your taxes. The check would be sent later.     As far as the taxes they take out of your paycheck, you can expect to have more taken out to pay for the stimulus package.     Basically you will get a check but you will be paying it back ,plus paying for everything else in the stimulus package out of your paycheck for the rest of your life. It will probably be only a small amount that you will hardly notice, but it will add up over time.     The bill for the stimulus package has only passed the House. It still has to pass the Senate. Good chance this is only Rev 1 and it will be revised before passing the Senate.     Also the total amount of the check is a maximum of $1000 for couples. The actual amount will be based on your income.|`|1219d6000cca01c9f3c4489d1c7b4a16aa	You are correct, it is a tax break, not checks as was the case in previous stimulus packages.  Although the tax cuts are up-front, instead of getting back more come tax time, they just won't withhold it.  You will get more take home pay, it averages about $20 per paycheck per person, which is not really a lot... but then again, that is an average.  The actual amount will be more or less.    The vast majority of the package that passed the house is really a giant earmark.  Their is another version of the same bill being debates in the senate.  I think the senate version has a better chance of dominating the final text of the legislation.  In all honesty, I would ignore the recent bill, give it two weeks before a final text is presented.  It is very likely though that taxes for the lower class will be drastically slashed for some time.|`|llUVXlLKaa	YOU ARE RIGHT YOUR HUSBAND IS WRONG|`|iBPqutK5aa	Obama does not fund Pork Barrel projects, and don't expect 1000 dollars unless you have 3 kids, obama is simply doing what he said.

Its a marvelous chance for the government to get all the stuff they have been wanting by convincing us that there is a crises and they need it.    Some of this stuff is obviously needed and good, but trying to convince us that its main purpose is to improve the economy is far-fetched.|`|TsjqzanQaa	Well, the Republicans aren't going along with it.    I wonder if some of them just don't want to delay it, so that they can clue in their cronies as to how to get some of the money, and set up some more offshore accounts to get the kickbacks, and other untraceable ways of concealing the bribes......     That's how some of them do business.    In any case, Obama's stimulus has yet to be actually put into play, and the depredations of the Bush regime will be with us for a long time to come.    Obama can't solve it overnight, it's going to take time, and there will be more problems before the economy finally stabilizes and improves.|`|MEReSvZeaa	Hold on to your seats.

dc11e42546ed6307d628d746dddbc7b7aa	Not very much to the wealthy, but as for the vast majority there'll be a lot of suffering, but who knows we may finally acquire a bit of political wisdom and put aside our apathy and retake our hijacked democracy.  For example realize that we elected the politicians who went on to serve the lobbyists for Zionism and Israel and investment bankers and warmongering indusries, and their friends like Haliburton, etc.  We may realize that BOTH Democrat and Republican parties have become a can of worms, corrupt, greedy and self-serving.  We will seek independent media to acquire proper information instead of disinformation we have been receiving. We'll want a proper independent enqury into 9/11, and instead of giving billions of our taxpayers money to Israel, we'd use our great power to prosecute the Israeli government leaders and many in the army as war criminals.  We'll respect the environment and be a force of good in the world.  Who knows maybe we'll a good lesson the hard way!|`|90ZaNZE4aa	we'd be in BIG trouble|`|fb0dca94b56ea1cf93761cb5d9e961e4aa	Stay tuned......|`|XzStbSPnaa	watch the news ts happening now.|`|M7oAG5Aiaa	Consider the worst parts of the bible and go from there.|`|9npIzlHKaa	FDR put measures in place that will keep this from happening.

But considering that we have been pretty bad off a number of times before, one of those times being the Great Depression, and we came out of it okay; I would assume we will come out of this one pretty well.    We haven't reached economic collapse yet, but we got through it the first time it happened.  We may have to subsist on beans, potatoes, and baloney (not bologna, that 99 cent stuff where the company doesn't even bother to spell it correctly); but we will survive.  It's what all living things were designed to do, survive.            That, or we will go the way of the Soviet Union.  Each state, or maybe a small group of states at a time, will break away in an attempt to break free of the economic problems of the others.  Then each will become its own separate country.      Unless you are trying to drive us to that whole NWO craziness.  Look, if it happens, then the Bible was correct and the Antichrist is here.  That just means you've got to hold out a few years until Jesus comes back and saves your *ss.  Or Mohammed, or Buddha, or whoever else has promised to come back for us; whichever is correct.    So that is the last one you should really worry about.  If it happens, it will be done soon.  Nothing you can do to stop it if its supposed to happen, and why would you want to anyway if it is part of God's plan?|`|AA11570618	We're about to find out. I predict we'll see the WORST economic depression in U.S. history by October, 2009. It seems the government's only answer to solving our economic woes is to throw money at it by writing trillions of dollars in corporate welfare checks.   GAO Director David Walker has been traveling the country with his 'Fiscal Wake Up Tour' for several years, predicting the 'bankruptcy of America'. But politicians are too cowardly to respond and citizens are too uninvolved to listen. Nobody wants to hear the truth.  Just as in 1929, the champagne will continue to flow until the very last moment when everything collapses. Then, like the great Greek and Roman empires, America will simply become a third-world country with little international influence or power.  And we'll blame the politicians who weren't courageous enough to do anythingn about it. But, it was our own arrogance, ignorance, avarice and hubris that brought us to the end of our civilization.   As Alexander Tyler once pointed out, the world's greatest democracies have always lasted about 200 years, and have always ended because of the people's ability to vote themselves largess from the public treasury. Loose fiscal policies and inept, corrupt government [combined with public apathy] will cause America to deteriorate into a weak and morally bankrupt society.  -RKO-|`|0tp5qpzkaa	Depends on what part of the US you lived in.I think the north would take alot harder hit.

Also, your question assumes that all blacks are poor, so they would be jealous of a rich white man. They might simply mug him for the money. They would have to have a good reason to attack him. So my answer to your first question is "no", and I also disagree that all crimes are hate crimes. Imagine this, you are a father to 2 kids, both 4 years old. You are poor and have no money to buy food, so you mug people to earn money to buy food. You do not hate the person that you mug, but it is still a crime. If each crime had the same punishment, then either EVERYONE who got a speeding ticket and murdered their friend would get killed. Or the contradiction, EVERYONE who murdered would get a fine of $100.|`|O1Unx5RUaa	It's called "wealth redistribution"    Now when 3 whites attack a black man, it's a hate crime.

Ask Micheal Jondan, his dad was murdered for a Lexus,  had nothing to do with race.|`|QlPTVcrHaa	If it had no motive other than beating him because he was white, it would be a hate crime.|`|a69285c771943e307ef29d01e7240d28aa	Well of course that is not a hate crime!

God knows the other white kids would have loved the scholarship.
PI8VfiY1aa	The US government does invest in scientific and medical research, yes.     Most drug companies are privately owned entities, and do not pay the federal government "finders fees."    If the government agency took taxpayer money to develop the drug, I see no reason why drug companies who make a profit cannot help inject some of that money right back into the system, although there is usually some indirect return-on-investment that the government makes anyway(example research creates jobs, illness prevention prevents subsidies for government-run health programs, exports to other countries, etc.)

89BVfrHyaa	This is something that could screw you over really bad if you end up being required to hold a Secret/Top Secret level clearance and you don't disclose to the military at first.     Talk to a Marine recruiter and see what he tells you if you're ineligible for enlisting into the Corps or not.|`|UoAZLRG8aa	Moral Standards   The United States Military Services make every attempt to assess the moral quality of potential recruits, and several categories of moral offenses may preclude enlistment. This is primarily accomplished based on criminal record.   I should note here that there is no such thing as a "sealed record," or an "expunged record" as far as the military is concerned. The recruiting services have access to law enforcement and FBI investigative records, which -- quite often will list arrests in these categories.     Lying to Get Into the Military is a Felony  Let's get straight to the point. Knowingly giving false information or withholding required information on any recruiting form is a criminal offense (When the information would have made an individual ineligible to enlist, or would have required a waiver to enlist). It's not a misdemenor, it's not the same as getting a speeding ticket. It's a felony offense, punishable by a $10,000 fine and three years in prison. If you lie to get into the military, you are committing a felony. It's that simple. If you get away with it long enough to actually enlist, and are caught later, it's also a "military offense." You can be prosecuted for a violation of Article 83 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), which states:    "Any person who--     (1) procures his own enlistment or appointment in the armed forces by knowingly false representation or deliberate concealment as to his qualifications for that enlistment or appointment and receives pay or allowances thereunder; or    (2) procures his own separation from the armed forces by knowingly false representation or deliberate concealment as to his eligibility for that separation; shall be punished as a court-martial may direct."|`|AA11635397	if the marines dont know and it dont go on your records than you fine

Let's send hundreds of billions of dollars to the auto industry, then let's change the EPA standards so that the auto industry is destined to fail? What kind of logic is that? It makes no sense!

We are, after all, the ones who put them in office.|`|JthubNIsaa	My question is why do we have some many Congress and Senate people anyway? It is obvious that more heads don't make more ideas. It in fact makes for more indecisiveness. Too make chefs in the kitchen. Nothing gets done.|`|flV8NKruaa	Not at all.  The congress of the US does much more than tinker with the economy. They also write and pass laws.  If they took 2 years off, there would be a lot of work that wasn't done.      Wait a minute.  I think that was just what happened for the last 6 years, congress took the last 6 years off!!!    I guess no one would miss them.|`|jKmbJyxJaa	I'd say we wipe out every single program that does not defend, feed, or provide health care to our citizens. Keep NOTHING but the absolute bare minimum needed to keep our country civilized. Work on the programs we have to make them more efficient and make sure every single person who needs them can utilize them. Then one day we might be able to reinstate much better programs than the ones we currently have.|`|5fabd1dde8996146708da2f18d2feea8aa	Thats an interesting thought, but it wouldnt work.  It has long been said that Power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely.  The D.C. in Washington, D.C. used to mean our capitol. Now it means District of Corruption.    When we get sick and run a fever, the heat of the fever is natures way of fighting our infections. But if we are injected with bacterial pneumonia, it will overpower almost anything Mother Nature can than throw at it and many of us will die without intervention with anti-bacterial drugs.    Think of congress as an antibiotic that will fight pneumonia, but congress uses needles that are contaminated with staph and other nasty organisms and they will kill many more of us than the pneumonia would.  This is a case of the cure being worse than the disease.    Our congressional representatives,  most of whom are lawyers, spent far for time in law school studying public speaking than business, finance and economics.  It appears that most of them spent NO time studying economics.  They want to regulate industries they dont understand, then they want to provide oversight when they dont know what they are looking at.      Most politicians have tribe-like loyalties to their parties, not to the people they are elected to service.  They want prestige, power and money, and they could care less about their constituents, most of whom dont even know who their elected representatives are.  They tell us what we need when we should be telling them both what we need and what we want want.    We need to find new ways to make our government(s) perform better.  If we dont, were going to be in bigger trouble than we are now.  And we're in big trouble now.|`|4160f1b362be1a382ff4fa170d98797caa	Hmmm... 242 dems for it, 11 dems against and complete republic dissention.

otYOxmnuaa	You're correct...here's a summary -- 13 pages of pork and 1 page of "stimulus"    http://www.usnews.com/articles/news/stim...    Obama is actually talking about another bailout amounting in the hundreds of billions of dollars for the banks -- again and could amount to 2.2 Trillion.  ======================================...    Joseph -- the Republicans presented a plan that created twice as many jobs and was 1/2 the cost...the Democrats voted it down.  What's the motivation here bud?|`|VScOsR8Paa	The Conservative alternative:    BETTER IDEAS  TWICE THE JOBS, HALF THE COST    Make the 2001 and 2003 Tax Cuts permanent, instead of raising taxes in 2011; Reduce Marginal Tax Rates for Individuals and Businesses by 10% creating new jobs. Adopting just this one proposal would create between 500,000 and 1 million jobs in one year.   Reduce the Death Tax to at least 15% ($5 mil. individual exclusion)   Enact long-term reforms and budgets for entitlement spending, putting long-term obligations from Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, front and center in the budget process.   Assess and enforce long term spending rules in Congress. Get us out of debt!|`|LiC73eggaa	we didn't need the bailout, but we need the stimulus.  remember democrats were against the bailout of wall street.|`|lRmhwiYpaa	Yes, When poor old George W Bush jr. did this he was called everything nasty~but now that Obama does the same things there is not enough roses to throw at Barack Obama~P|`|LSxBwiFSaa	Yup. But considering the Republican "Alternative" (doing Nothing), I guess there's no help for it...  :)
fKFvzlzQaa	Unfortunately it is politically popular with special interest groups to spend money.    Politicians have found that the cheapest way for them to be reelected is to buy votes With Government Pork.|`|D2YaTaUIaa	Spending is the Democrat way.  It always has been.  It will never change.  Obama supporters should have known this, before voting in someone who, the people have no experience on knowing his background.  You guys wanted change? Your going to get it. It's just not going to effect Republicans as much as it will towards Democrats.|`|ynlft41Uaa	The government thinks that since we already have a massive debt, that it's ok to just print money out the gazoo now.    Liberals and Conservatives have helped to create this; you do realize that Congress had to authorize the war in Iraq. It was also Congress that created the Preposterous Poppycock (Paulson Plan) which was equally as expensive as the entire Iraq war up to that time.|`|LCCsJ62Saa	First off it started during the first war this country ever had. We will never be caught up. We will always be in debt. The system is created that way.

Now some of the experts are saying that the banking industry can only be "saved" by more taxpayer money.    The Congress and the President are going to bankrupt the country and saddle future generations with a National Debt that can't possibly be paid off.  Has anyone looked at Iceland's financial status lately?|`|A6YaJzecaa	The war in Iraq is over. Our government is there to help keep law and order and to teach those that are in power a new government. We will always have men and women in Iraq, just as we still do in Germany, Japan, etc.    As far as government spending, both parties can take credit for our nation's debt. They have no idea what they're doing and the people they place in positions that concerns this matter, can't even handle their own affairs at home. I think we would all be surprised at how much goes into their pockets, as well. I do know, they took our social security, invested it in failing ventures and blame the baby boomers. Stop and think about it. Baby boomers paid in all their lives, many died in Vietnam, many die of illnesses, accidents and never draw a penny from social security and those that do live, don't live long enough to get what they paid in.    I think we need to get rid of all those that serve our nation and start fresh.|`|ON8jxJx2aa	America sucks and always will. get over it

A Republican in Congress apologized to him for telling other Republicans not to listen to him. I think that is one of the stupidest things I've ever heard|`|GrdRLg9daa	Newt Gingrich should be the leader because when he was the leader he forced Clinton to balance the budget and he fought for conservative values, fiscal responsibility, and limited government. The Republican Party started acting like a bunch of wasteful Democrats after he left.    The current leader is nobody. The Republican party has fallen apart.|`|PDRS7YT3aa	there is no leadership in the Republican party|`|Zp93fab3aa	For the far right extremists- Sarah Palin    For the reasonable moderates- John McCain.|`|R1LvhhTeaa	Rush Limbo - he's enough of a worthless piece of dog sh*t to be head of our dear old GOP.|`|i5F2jwvhaa	I would go with Gingrich    He seems to be the most level headed conservative you listed|`|SS1VReF0aa	John Boehner, he seems to be the most powerful and most vocal recently.    You can't really throw non-political people into the mix like O'Reilly and Limbaugh...it's easy for a radio host or TV host to be vocal about issues, it's not so easy for politicians that have to work with all sides of the political sphere. If Limbaugh was in the Senate or in Congress, he would never get any support on anything he tried to accomplish because he is so partisan...that isn't how Washington works.|`|AA10719402	I am really liking the whole Limbaugh Rep leader.    It makes the right look even more fringe.    If they were going to get some balls and start to look moderate again, I suggest they go with Romney.|`|neuprBeGaa	I'd have to say John Boehner.  You can start off by leaving out the pundits - they follow the lead of the Party, and whip up support.  They don't direct it.    McCain and Gingrich are both past.  Gingrich tries to be a spokesman, but really is more a pundit these days.    Palin may be a voice for the future...but frankly, she doesn't have the skill or intellect.  She could possibly become a figurehead for someone else, but that's the best she could do.    Kyl is second-fiddle to both McCain and McConnell.  Duncan just handles the paperwork.    It has to be McConnell or Boehner - and I think Boehner is the better-known.    I notice you left out Rove and Jindal, though.  I'd agree with leaving out Jindal for now, but he's the current best shot the Republicans have for a future president.  And of course, just because Rove lurks in the shadows doesn't mean he's not a significant source of direction.|`|LiC73eggaa	Rush Limbaugh|`|3b0iEteqaa	Condoleezza Rice --not on your list--but on mine, just the same!!|`|xVRGz3Oaaa	Out of this list--Gingrich|`|9Nx0MPaeaa	John McCain if he would stand alone.

Afghanistan is where we should have been all alone, and just maybe, this trillion dollar war would be over.|`|aTAUOI8caa	You obviously didn't pay attention.    That is precisely what he said he would do.  He literally said, "I will draw down troops in Iraq responsibly (which he is doing), and move them to Afghanistan (where the actual terrorists are)."      There is nothing to feel weird about, other than that there is a politician who is actually holding to his promises.      Including what he meant by change.  You obviously weren't listening there either, but what he said he meant by change was that he was going to working toward bipartisanship and ending this schism between Republicans and Democrats.    He has already begun by making his Cabinet out of the extremes of the Clinton and the extremes of the Bush Administration, and then combining them with those in the center of the political spectrum; and literally getting ALL of them to work together.    He is also going to Republicans in Congress for help and input into making his stimulus bill.  And when Nancy Pelosi tried to shut out the Republicans, Obama stood up for them to make sure they were heard.        He is also holding to change exactly as he promised.
89BVfrHyaa	Nope, you cannot swear in at MEPS until the military clears all waivers. Medical, criminal, and administrative waivers need to be cleared before you sign at X______ since it can take quite some time for those waivers to be approved.

I can tell your joining the army thats what i was in, well stilll reserves. These guys are like car sales men...if they dont have your deal....walk...they get you into the "car"
ymNM6mmzaa	Yes.  Just make sure that the Guidance Counselor knows that you are interested in the length of training as you look at jobs with him/her.|`|sO9SpUo4aa	Yes, A recruiter must give you the entire list of all MOS's you  are qualified for if asked.  He is looking to fill certain jobs and will try to make your decision simple. One to five choices max.  If you think, he may loose the contract.  Besides he knows what you want by now and is trying to help you be the best. The length of AIT should not be the deciding factor. If it is go infantry, AIT may be short but the tour in Afghanistan will be worse.

Now when the middle and lower class quit being among the largest population of consumers, and our economy quits being driven by consumer spending, I'll change that view to fit the new conditions.|`|aTAUOI8caa	You'd be surprised how many times there is only one side to an issue; and both sides want to get that goal.    But they fight so much that they don't actually realize they are fighting for the same thing.        Democrats are for war, as long as it is a just war.  Well guess what, Republicans also want a just war.  We agree in theory, we just have to work together to find a way to put together what constitutes a just war.  And both want peace whenever possible.    Democrats only want to make sure that women maintain control over their own bodies and that the government not be given that control; well Republicans don't want government in control of women's bodies either.  Republicans only want to save babies, but so do Democrats.    Democrats aren't elitist, and Republicans don't love only the rich.  Neither hates the poor.  They just disagree about how best to help the poor.          And if we weren't trying to paint the other side as nutz, we could talk it out and put together we are all actually after the same goal.  That is we want a society that is moral enough without being a theocracy, and an economy that is stable enough without making me pay for everyone in America, that we can raise our kids to be fine and upstanding individuals.    That's all that everyone in America wants.  Now we just have to hold it together and not lose our minds as we discuss how best to do that.            Add-on:    Well, I tried buddy.  Got a thumbs down for it, and no support.  Guess people don't want to believe that the other side is okay.    All well, what can you do.

My observation, your media is so parochial and so biased. Most TV journalists seem to be 100% biased conservative or 100% biased liberal. Neither conservative nor liberal have a monopoly on the truth. Both have plenty of merit, the debate is should the pendulum swing to the left or right, and how far.  I totally agree, lets all lose our tunnel vision.  We all need to criticize our own side of politics when criticism is needed, and, god forbid, praise our opponents when praise is needed.

1GzmHZcfaa	Um...do you think people haven't been TRYING? There's only so much you can do when public education sucks and jobs are hard to find. It's true that these conditions vary considerably from region to region, but you should see some of the public schools in inner city Detroit--it's fairly horrific. I completely agree that any change needs action by the people in order to work--but the common myth that the people who aren't satisfied with our country now are doing nothing but sitting back and complaining about it simply isn't true.    By the way, our country having a bad image in the world has nothing to do with us having a bad self-image. In fact it's kind of the opposite; it's America assuming we can do no wrong that has caused it. I'm not even talking about the Iraq or Afghanistan wars here. The obscene amounts of money we give to Saudi Arabia, our little habit of supporting dictators and military coups in other countries...we haven't exactly had ourselves on a strict moral barometer.     BTW, before you utter the words "socialist sh1thole," take a look at Europe. Universal health care, free education, longer life expectancies, lower infant mortality, lower unemployment.

There are also reports that the "Fairness Doctrine" might be re-instated. But very few Democrats are advocating the Doctrine's return, and Obama has said he doesn't support it.    And the truth is, he probably doesn't. Obama used talk radio very well in organizing his campaign. Of course, "Ditto Heads" don't know that, because most of them don't listen to Black talk radio.

YDlfu6AUaa	If I were a criminal or a person trying to overthrow the American people this is exactly the type of measure I would want passed into law.    They will one day try to take away private gun ownership and that's the day as Americans we need to Unite and take back this Country and make it ours again instead of the Governments dirty,stinking,rotten and highly corrupted Politicians.    When the cats away the mice will play and the cats been away for a long, long time.    It will be a very cold day in hell indeed before they take away my guns!|`|U0Rvsabdaa	Yes, its amazing how selective they are on what rights they like. I'd be fine with respecting all the rights fully, thats what our founders wanted.|`|OYtoM9fXaa	Leftists who get downright teary-eyed in defense of every last comma and jot in the First and Fourth Amendments have a tendency to feel the Founding Fathers were simply joking when they wrote the Second and Tenth.|`|93r3nCM1aa	Ok look...my husband and I are both liberals and we have 4 guns (M 19-11, M-16 A1, M1020 rifle, and an M686 revolver) and I REALLY don't understand what the big deal is with requiring a license.     The Constitution says "the right of the People to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed." Implementing a licensing and record of sale system doesn't mean someone CAN'T own a gun...only that there's a precondition.    I really don't see the big deal. I'm all for the second ammendment and I'm anti-gun control..I just don't see a license as being a form of gun control.     (oh and BTW, my husband is a professional rifleman with the USMC. If ANYONE is pro-2nd amemdment, it's him)|`|SlhuFfuZaa	It is true the Constitution gives us the right to keep and bear arms, any way for the time being.  Why do those in power want to ban privately owned guns. That's a simple question to answer.  If you are in power and you want to make major changes like take away many liberties and rights and the average citizen has a gun, as does each of his neighbors, you don't want to have to go to war against the people that pay your wages, so you first take their guns. Once all of the registered guns are gone you have a little better chance. At this time you add a heavy tax on ammo, and mark all ammo so it can be easily recognized and traced to a particular store and when that store sold it, they had to log it and they have you cold with a gun. They come to your house and there go your hidden non registered guns and you pay a big fine, go to jail and they watch you for the rest of your life.  I do not like any law requiring me to register a weapon or restricting what I can have. I have always been an honest citizen and have been a deputy sheriff, but I will not register my hunting equipment, nor will I ever submit to confiscation of said weapons.  If that makes me an outlaw, then so be it.|`|zrHLiU0Faa	YEAH!!

It's assumed if I think some social programs work for the greater good that I must be a Socialist ala the Soviet Union.  It's assumed that if I think we should follow the guidelines of the Geneva Conventions that means I want all "terrorists" to be given medals of freedom and a package of cupcakes.  It's assumed that if I oppose one war I must be opposed to all wars.  It's assumed if I am pro-choice that I want that choice to be abortion.  It's assumed that if I favor some forms of gun control that must mean I only want criminals to have guns.  It's assumed that if I don't make as much money as someone else they must be smarter/harder-working than me.  The list is endless.

Their solution is total control over all they have to manage as a result and Tyranny results.   (But then, that is probably what they want to achieve.)

DTSUJe2oaa	It would be, Procedural due process:  Procedural due process is essentially based on the concept of "fundamental fairness." As construed by the courts, it includes an individual's right to be adequately notified of charges or proceedings, and the opportunity to be heard at these proceedings. Procedural due process has also been an important factor in the development of the law of personal jurisdiction.    In the United States, criminal prosecutions and civil cases are governed by explicit guarantees of procedural rights under the Bill of Rights, most of which have been incorporated under the Fourteenth Amendment to the States. Due process has also been construed to generally protect the individual so that statutes, regulations, and enforcement actions must ensure that no one is deprived of "life, liberty, or property" without a fair opportunity to affect the judgment or result. This protection extends to all government proceedings that can result in an individual's deprivation, whether civil or criminal in nature, from parole violation hearings to administrative hearings regarding government benefits and entitlements to full-blown criminal trials. In criminal cases, many of these due process protections overlap with procedural protections provided by the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which guarantees reliable procedures that protect innocent people from being punished, which would be tantamount to cruel and unusual punishment.    In 1934, the United States Supreme Court held that due process is violated "if a practice or rule offends some principle of justice so rooted in the traditions and conscience of our people as to be ranked as fundamental".[  ~

I didn't know there was a requirement for female recruits to be as ugly as sin!!!  I have met plenty of outstanding looking women in the military.    Some were too damn vain for their own good.|`|5k7BexD3aa	You need to do the research on the branches and see what best fits you.
EPqnB7Epaa	As long as he isn't a white Republican he will get the same media coverage Obama got.  If the next President is a gay black man watch out, it will be a media frenzy the likes the world has never seen.|`|6nS62bB8aa	The next President will get even more coverage, all of it bad.    Because our next President will be a Conservative who was elected to cut taxes and bring America out of the depression which is now beginning to unfold. That would be the same depression which Barry and the the hard-line socialist Democrats prolonged with a "stimulus package".|`|dXxXj9mKaa	uh|`|lvBUl3Zdaa	They all get loads of coverage. Reporters and publications fall all over themselves to try to get in good with the President.|`|cua3iiqIaa	only if the us stays in power and these crisis keep on happening then yes. if USA dies from the economy crash then probably not|`|aVEVchFxaa	There's always a lot of hoopla displayed for every single President taking office. It is nothing new, and will continue to happen forever. Obama has not started some new trend, many of you just have very short memories There was a big deal made over Bush taking office twice. That was not necessary IMO, because everyone already knew about him and the same ole tired stuff that he was bringing back with him.|`|xmmjVaAUaa	I don't know about "outdoing" Obama, but he will definitely get a lot of media coverage, if only because this is the guy who is taking up the man's mantle. Every news station in the world will be comparing the next president to our current one, whether they're similar or not. Now that the race factor has been broken for the presidential running, there are only three barriers left: gender, religion, and sexual orientation. I have no doubt that until one of these barriers have been breached, no president will receive the same amount of attention from the media that Barack Obama has gotten.
JDltTREfaa	Probably not.  It is extremely difficult to make a successful insanity defense.  In your situation you made the decision to go off of your meds - so the argument I would make as the prosecutor is that it is reasonably foreseeable that you would lose control of yourself and that was a risk you chose to accept by going off of your meds.    The biggest problem you would face is that to be considered "insane" - you would have to prove that at the time you kicked at the officer you did not know the difference between right and wrong.  This will be next to impossible for you to prove.  You knew when you did it that it was wrong.  That you didn't have enough self control because of your Bipolar doesn't change what you knew.  (And if I were the prosecutor, I would use your "continuous apology" as proof that you knew the behavior was wrong.)    Yes.  Assaulting a peace officer is a felony.  Thank goodness he wasn't injured!  But this could be the biggest factor that will keep you out of prison.  (Prison.  Not jail.  Minor criminals go to jail.  Felons go to prison.)  Have you ever been arrested before - especially for assault?  If your record is clean AND you get your behind back on medication to stabilize your mood, you probably have a good chance at a reduced charge or perhaps deferred prosecution.|`|LJkPRqN0aa	you can plea temporary insanity but its up to the judge to decide whether you were or not. ive had experience with a friend that is bipolar so i know some of the effects that it can cause.... you can try...|`|AA12109395	Doubtful, Judges are very unsympathetic to people who break the law in general, but especially those who assault police officers. If you compound what you have already done with some fabricated story about your medical condition, side affects and temporary insanity, that tells the judge you are making excuses instead of taking responsibility for your actions. You cannot possibly fabricate a story that they have not already heard. Remember, what you say and do in the courtroom are considered in your sentence!|`|k3ZVZmBJaa	Sure, you can plea not guilty by reason of mental defect (or whatever terminology you have in your state).  My guess is that a lot depends on the charges against you.  If you really hurt the policeman and they are going hard for a felony conviction, you may have to undergo a psych. examination.  If the state is only going for a misdemeanor or reduced charge, they will probably just take your word based on documentation from your doctor.    Even if you are found to be not guilty, you will still be held RESPONSIBLE.  You must face some consequences, and most likely that will include incarceration at a mental hospital for treatment.  This could also depend on your previous criminal record (if there is one).    Regardless, you need to get some legal advice from an actual attorney.|`|XGgPhaDbaa	I doubt it, because you know you are supposed to be on medication to keep from acting like an *** but you did not take your medicine willingly. You knew there could be complications due to not being on your medication.|`|RRFbDou9aa	You can plead insanity but the definition is really stringent. Being bipolar doesn't exempt you from assault laws.
tqD9xUpYaa	I don't know where you live, but my nephew in Strongsville, Ohio has his apt. buzzer set to ring on his cell phone.  This wasn't a problem for his apt. management at all when he moved there as well as when he changed apartments in the same complex.|`|lgyPxg26aa	There is no law, but I don't understand why he couldn't connect to any local phone number.  There really is no difference.  Just give him the number of your cell phone and tell him it's your new land line.  See what happens.    If you have a long distance number, he wouldn't want to connect to that as it would cost him every time someone pushes your button.

WyCmQBuvaa	Some bastard forcefully took from you something you can never, ever get back..  As a young girl you dream about what your first kiss will be like.  In adolescense, you think about sleeping with your boyfriend.  You want it to be special.  You want your first to be a boy /man that you love.  Tender, romantic.    This will never happen.    You wonder if:  Could I be pregnant with my rapists child?                         Did he give me AIDs or something else?                           Is there something I could have done to prevent it?                         You feel dirty, humiliated, ashamed.    This bastard ruined this girl's life.  She will NEVER be able to have a normal relationship with a man again.  All trust in men is gone.  Even after time and it takes a very long time, if she gets involved with a guy, even if he is the nicest, sweetest, most gentle man,  they will never have a good, healthy sex life.    This girl never was with a man.  She never knew what it was like to make love to each other.  All she knows about sex is what this bastard did to her.    She will try to make love one day to someone she trusts, but the whole time, every single detail of the rape will be playing in her head over and over again.  This is all she knows.  Sex is bad.  Sex is rape.    If they catch this bastard and she has to go to court, she will be put on the stand and be made out to be a whore or that she asked for it.    If you are really a friend, be there for her but don't push her.  Why don't you go to the library, you can read can't you, and take out some books on the subject.  Read about actual victims and what they went through and how their lives were forever affected.  Maybe then you might understand.   Why is it so traumatic?  How would you feel if it happened to you?|`|epbzW5N8aa	It affect each person different just be there for your friend, she will open up when she is ready.|`|6y94LMmqaa	Well hopefully, the healing process starts. If you let that one instance control you, you cannot get the most out of life. Even if she seems like she doesnt want to talk about it, she probably does. Let her know that you want to help her and that you want her to be ok|`|AA12109395	It varies from person to person but some feel anger, guilt, isolation, embarrassment, shame, betrayed, distrustful, and many others that probably only someone with personal experience could share with you. If you really won't to support her, don't press her to talk about it. If and when she wants to talk to you, she will, or maybe not, her choice. She does, however, need to talk to a professional to help her work through the traumatic experience and her emotions.|`|JI7NQ9TNaa	Violation is a difficult thing to explain, or express.  Rape is all about violence, and control.   Sex is intimate...so its the most "personal" crime there is.    Pain, fear...and even disbelief are common reactions after the fact.  Add anger to that...and you have the tip of the ice berg.    Oh yes...and its the only crime where most people blame the victim.  If you get mugged, you get sympathy.   Get raped? Lots of whispers.    Try to be supportive. When she can talk about it, she might need a friend.|`|6eoMqJF0aa	pretty traumatic she will need time to get things straightened out.|`|XGgPhaDbaa	I hope her mother knows about this and they are pressing charges. Also the girl needs to see a professional therapist-either one on one or group. This is a very bad thing to go thru and she needs all the help she can get.|`|mlDV1Xsqaa	First of all, everyone is going to react a little differently. Here are the usual things to expect though.  Possibly shutting down, not wanting to talk to anyone, just shutting people out who are normally close  On edge and jumpy about little things  One of the biggest things, she will probably blame herself, trying to see what she did wrong to bring this on to herself  Be ready to get her some help, she probably will not see that she needs it right away, if at all  Just be there for her, through all the moods and troubles she is bound to go through. what she really needs right now is a shoulder to cry on and someone to just listen to her.

I don't think very many people know this though because everyone always jumps up and down yelling about how it should be the "black house" now and etc.|`|pqHkoHJhaa	He's half black.  His father is from Kenya and his mother from the Us.|`|6AE5PKlNaa	I believe Obama is considered a black man because the general population wants to see social "change" in the United States; therefore, by voting for a black man, they create that change.  If we considered him to be white, the social change perception would not have the same global impact that electing an African-American does.|`|gfeVkkHNaa	No. He is mix, half white and half black mom(white) dad(black).

nZGx7wy6aa	From your post im guessing he is in the national guard. When he gets home he is done, he can go back to doing whatever he was doing befor he joined the army. He will need to go visit his recruiter so that they can put all the paperwork through so that he gets his bonus. 92a is a supply job in the army so he will be helping out the supply sgt. at his unit when he goes to the monthy drill. AGR is when you work full time for the national guard at the unit or at a headquarters. Im not sure if you lose your bonus but it is a good job. You get paid just as if you are active duty with housing and everything. Your still do everything with your unit like deploy and drill and everything. Hope this helps|`|kyTBaYFlaa	english please|`|96ojhoXvaa	if he is called for active duty he can not get out of it, he will probably get 3 weeks or so at home and then be stationed somewhere.  He does not get to pick where.  And yes he could lose he sign on bonus if he does not do what he signed on to do.

hmA8nfA2aa	ryan w is correct. You should visit the Army's webiste. Job training for Military Police requires 19 weeks of One Station Unit Training (OSUT), which includes Basic Training and Advanced Individual Training, and on-the-job instruction, including practice in police methods. This time is spent in both the classroom and in the field. Some of the skills you'll learn are:    *Basic warrior skills   *Military and civil laws and jurisdiction   *Crime and accident investigation procedures   *Evidence collection procedures, including fingerprinting and suspect questioning   *Use of firearms   *Traffic and crowd control procedures   *Arrest and restraint of suspects     There are many things to consider when thinking about becoming a law enforcement officer. Check out http://www.peaceofficerjobs.com for excellent information and advice about becoming a law enforcement officer. Good luck!|`|yLQ2rUHnaa	almost 19 weeks, 9 week basic training and 10 weeks of AIT it is a OSUT(one station unit training)MOS. basically the soldiers and drill sergeants you start basic training with will be with you all the way through AIT.
ftQcubGnaa	So I guess the media must have supported Bush both times he won.    !!!!!!! -   I didnt know that !      !!!!! -|`|4Vmlf902aa	Yeah it was like McCain was the wife at home, waiting. While Obama was the mistress and the media the husband. I'm sorry if that sounds wrong, but that was how it was.       But still VERY interesting elections last year. I can't wait for the 2012, when I can vote.|`|q4EXFhV7aa	Yes, it was fair. There are reporting agencies that show this to be the case. Nielsson for one. While MSNBC was more fair to Obama, Fox was more fair to McCain and CNN was pretty equal to both....the three main basic stations were fair to both candidates, but focused more on Palin than either of the frount runners....both positive and negative. The NYT article wasn't published because McCain didn't actually respond to the question he was asked to respond to. They DID post the story that same week....just not in the place that was reserved for the response that they wanted from him.|`|fb0dca94b56ea1cf93761cb5d9e961e4aa	Obama was bought and paid for.|`|ihfsrPlkaa	yes. it doesn't matter anyway because it's done.|`|lRmhwiYpaa	Yes, I voted for McCain and he and Sarah Palin LOST    I feel the campaign was lost when anyone ran with the Bush legacy    plus McCain kind of wimped out~he should have made a more    bolder statement instead of withdrawing his campaign just for the    economic bail out~this was quite lame~and Sarah Palin just added    fuel to his funeral pyre..this is probably the only way Barack Obama    could get in the  White House~he ran with the WIND and his opponent    was a tired old man and a very naive women~both lost the election    and one was not better then the other~~~~|`|VK0brk89aa	It doesn't matter now does it.     What does matter to me is that the next election is done without racial bullying & sexism.

While Obama had to defend everything from his church to his vague business acquaintances to his birth certificate, McCain was given a free ride to spread lies about Iran, Clinton's economic success and most of all his own spurious anti-American contacts.  It was McCain that had it easy - not having to explain anything and being given a free ride to spew any lies.|`|lpwcqkNbaa	No one sees whom you vote when go to the voting booth so how can you say media swayed everyone in for voting for Obama.  People voted with their conscience|`|pM81f5tnaa	Yeah.  Both candidates had a chance to influence the media.      But you know, the direction of the bias is arguable, and as an Obama fan, I naturally see it differently.   I was sickened by the amount of air time devoted to such non-issues as Rev. Wright, Bill Ayers, flag pins, and "bitterness."  And it bothered me that one rarely heard a commentator talk about McCain without calling him a "hero."  So it depends on one's perspective, doesn't it?|`|yFHJm6iJaa	It depends on what you mean by fair.    If you mean was it fair in the sense that neither candidate had something working against them other than their own personal and political past, then no, it wasn't fair. But it was not the media as you are proposing. Bush and/or Cheney were the best gift anybody could have given the Democratic party. Put it this way.....when the sitting Pres. doesn't publicly campaign for his party, that is a clue that his own party believes his presence on the campaign trail would have done more damage than good. Young people were drawn to the election because the Democratic nominee was not another rich white guy, and because the mismanaged conflicts in the Middle East have dominated their perception of politics. I don't know that many 18-25 yr olds who read the NY Times. Do you?    If you mean is it fair in terms of the tendency of American politics to fluctuate between liberal and conservative leanings, then yes it is fair. The Bush Admin. made a mockery of not only American ideals, but of his own party as well. Bush presided over one of the most fiscally irresponsible presidency's in our history. Dick Cheney created a 4th branch of the federal govt., which happened to be him, and also happened to be immune from scrutiny by anybody. I could go on, but I will leave it at this. To me it almost seems like they gave absolutely no concern to the fact that he would not be President forever.    The bottom line, which has been echoed by quite a few conservatives, is that the Republican party is more responsible for its marginalization than anybody, or anything else. That includes McCain's failed campaign.|`|EPVWrEOxaa	i dont think it swayed young voters minds. at least not for me. i chose him based on my own reasons.|`|ntIYkqX6aa	No, Mccain had to stoop to palin to get noticed by the people...when in doubt....hire on a stupid, and slightly attractive women.|`|nksPs9xFaa	obama was the first black man to get as far as he did.so he got tons of votes.  of course it was unfair. as a girl put it in my class "yall have had plenty yall in there give us a chance" yes, because race really matters. i didnt get it and dont care.  but no it wasnt fair. i definantly agree with the person who answered first.|`|enAhUrLfaa	See what happens when ALL the votes get counted.|`|9Nx0MPaeaa	It was as fair as the previous elections were.  Obama won with the help of multiple people of various backgrounds who wanted something different.   Obama put a spark in people that wasn't there for a long time.   The same people who voted for him, also, are very proud of their selection.  If you think the media has that much influence, why with the help of fox news and all of the other republican tv and radio personality did mccain lose?   Thanks for asking.|`|V90Ao2jfaa	WHY do people think that just because Obama was black, people voted for him???!!!! When Al- Sharpton ran WE DIDDN'T HAVE HIS BACK but all the sudden we are so in love with black people? Get a grip!

PLUS haven't you noticed what the past 8 years have been like? people didn't vote for Barrak they voted for "ANYTHING BUT MCCAIN" so that they could hold onto what's left of their wallets.    If we do bad "IT'S BECAUSE WE'RE BLACK"  if we do good "IT'S BECAUSE WE'RE BLACK"    COMMON PEOPLE! Get over it he got in because he's better.|`|AA12337052	No it was not. The media essentially elected him for us by poisoning impressionable minds with their own Liberal agenda.|`|AA11148986	I think it was unfair for McCain in the sense that he was in the same party as George Bush.    When the economy fell apart, people blamed Bush and rejected his neoconservative stance on the issues. Plus, there was his pick for VP, Sarah Palin who was seen as dim-witted and not ready to lead thanks to interviews with Charles Gibson and Katie Couric.    Before all that, McCain was neck and neck, sometimes even ahead of Obama in the polls.|`|5iC7g3zraa	Definitely NOT!!!    Obama had the upper edge in technology and speech  while   McCain is far older, and not a very good spokesperson
aVEVchFxaa	Like someone else said, Bush and an outrageous bill for the war. Jobs being sent overseas. Corporate greed, and the bailouts rewarding corporate greed. Employers fearing going under, so the only thing they can think of is to layoff many employees. Laid off employees can't circulate money back into the stores, restaurants, etc, so these businesses are forced to close because consumer money is not there anymore .....|`|JzYlcuXzaa	Greed, power and corruption.  All these years of them thinking "what's the worst that could happen?"  has really blown up in their faces and we're all paying for it.|`|rqH8mAM2aa	I SAY LET THE CHIPS FALL WHERE THEY MAY ! I LOST HOPE IN THE GOVERNMENT SENCE GOD AND STATE ARE NO LONGER ONE! OH LOOK UP THE WORD GOVERNMENT!|`|8j7FCEOraa	The biggest problem, is that when the economy starts to crash people are actually supposed to buy, buy, buy to continue stimulating the economy. Cant have as many jobs open when you're suddenly not so productive.  But not so many jobs, not getting paid so much leads to job cuts. And job cuts lead to people really freaking out.  So the more that people stress and put their money away into banks instead of puttings it back into the economy by buying goods, the less currency is being cycled in the economy.|`|AA11570236	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession|`|zEVpA4WCaa	LOOK NO FURTHER THAN YOUR DEM'S IS THE HOUSE AND SENATE.

But Freddie/Fannie didn't worry the iffy new homeowner couldn't afford because they bundled it up and sold it to wall street.

GIpkz4iZaa	DUI stands for Driving Under the Influence. DWI stands for either Driving While Intoxicated or Driving While Impaired. Another term that is sometimes used is Operating While Impaired (OWI). All these terms relate to driving after consuming alcohol or drugs. The drugs don't have to be illegal for a DUI to be issued - they can be illegal narcotics, over the counter medication, or prescribed medication. Depending upon the state in which you are the severity of the offense may vary.    In some states, the drunk driving laws differentiate between a DUI and a DWI, where the DUI is a lesser charge. In these states, a DUI usually signifies a lesser degree of intoxication, which is determined by a persons blood alcohol level at the time of arrest. Sometimes, states will allow the charges of a DWI to be reduced to a DUI. In the case of a reduction from a DWI to a DUI, certain conditions typically must be met, such as the incident being a first offense, the defendants display of remorse for the action, and a blood alcohol level that was not drastically over the legal limit. For example, the state of New York differentiates between DWI and DUI by establishing a blood alcohol level of .08 as the legal limit for DWI. If a person has a blood alcohol level of .07, the charges may be reduced to a DUI, which carries a lesser punishment.    Some states (like Virginia and New Jersey) do not recognize any difference between a DUI and a DWI. As far as the laws of these states are concerned, any blood alcohol level over the specified limit is a crime that will be punished in the same manner.    In Minnesota, on the other hand, there is technically no such thing as a DUI because they only use the term DWI.    In some states, the terms DUI and DWI are used to indicate whether a person was driving impaired under the influence of drugs or alcohol. In this case, DUI is reserved for illegal drugs.    The distinction for the federal government is drawn based on severity. A DWI is issued when the blood alcohol content (BAC) is over the 0.08 limit, whereas a DUI is a less severe term, given when a persons BAC is under 0.08.|`|JzYlcuXzaa	DUI - Driving Under The Influence    DWI - Driving While Intoxicated    Theoretically, they both mean the same thing.|`|hHSsMyNpaa	DUI also DWAI (Driving While Ability Impaired) usually is driving while  having a BAC (Blood Alcohol Content) of .08.  DWI (Driving While Intoxicated) is driving with a BAC of .12 usually.  There are stiffer penalties for DUI vs. DWI drivers.|`|SS1VReF0aa	Different names in different states.

T6nmD3X9aa	maybe its because you have no spelling/grammer skills and put down all the wrong info on your paperwork?    OK, seriously, I am very sorry that you are having trouble with this. A child needs his mom and you seem to be doing a good job to earn back everyones trust. You do have to consider your son though. How would it look if the court put him back in your care if they were not positive you would stay clean? You may put your son in harms way without even realizing it. The way they look at it is that your son is safe right now and until they are sure about you and your living arrangements, they may not change that. Here are some suggestions (if you have not already done so):  1) make sure you have a steady job  2) make sure you are able to support yourself & son  3) make sure you can prove you have a good support system (babysitter for when you have to work, your mom at times of need)  4) enroll in an outpatient program. Get letters from your sponsers.  5) Have a nice, CLEAN, home (with 2 bedrooms) - because they WILL take a tour.   6) be on time for EVERYTHING! Do not make excuses for ANYTHING! Be honest - excuses are a sign of negative behavior and all social workers hate that.       good luck, hoped this helped a little|`|VXcp8hvHaa	because and no you will never stop paying lawyer bills|`|z88IMXNFaa	You are not a person to be trusted with a child - no druggie is.

nOlwYnunaa	A few reasons I guess.  The most important one being not contaminating any evidence.  If someone shows up without a specific duty they may wander around looking for stuff to do and step on or in some way disturb evidence.

AA10925828	Adoption is a major event.  You don't want anything to go wrong with the adoption.  My best advice is to hire an attorney to fill out and file the required forms so that you know everything is done right.  It will be worth the money you pay the attorney.  The fact that you're asking the question is reason alone for you to hire an attorney.  You don't know all the little nuances that go along with an adoption, even one where the father is willingly signing away his parental rights.    Since the father is saying he is willing to voluntarily sign the papers, the costs should be reasonable.    Good luck with the adoption.|`|z88IMXNFaa	Why would you want to do this?  As the father, he is required to pay child support and that's enforceable.  There's no reason to agree to this.|`|85jy4Mt0aa	Unless someone is waiting to adopt the child, it is not likely to be in the child's interest to terminate the father's rights and obligations.    Under Texas law, the child has a right to support from both parents.  You should not reduce the resources available to your child just because it may serve your interests.    Discuss this with your lawyer.    You may be able to obtain child support while limiting visitation, if it is in the child's best interest.    Don't rush into a decision that may harm your child.|`|QP7VyPV6aa	My guess is that if he isn't on the birth certificate that you haven't been to court for child support. If this is true, he currently has no rights nor obligations to your child. Which sucks for your child. Even if you think about it like this:  No matter what your financial sutuation is, extra money for your kid for whatever she needs or wants or to save for college is always positive.   Another thing to think of is years down the ropad when your child wants to know about the father, and they will! You do not wanna be the one who intentionally kept them from knowing each other unless, the father is a child molestor, or rapist or some horrible monster in the flesh!
DTSUJe2oaa	A Class U Felony is actually a unclassified felony. Certain crimes, such as grand larceny, are termed unclassified felonies. This is because the punishment for conviction of these crimes is defined by the specific statute criminalizing the offense, not by the general guidelines described above.    Grand larceny is an unclassified felony with a specific punishment assigned by the code section of not less than one year in prison but not more than twenty or in the discretion of a jury or judge trying the case, a jail sentence of not more than 12 months and/or a fine not to exceed $2,500.~

You need to fill out DA Form 4187    The Commander of both soldiers must approve the swap.    You must have at least 12 months at your current duty station    You have to pay the move cost yourself and take ordinary leave to do the move.|`|89BVfrHyaa	I've never heard of this program, and I highly doubt that even if it did exhist, it wouldn't be on anything but a case by case basis. Your friend who doesn't want to re-deploy sounds **** out of luck, and needs to get a hand full of his nuts and drive on. Shouldn't have signed a 6 year contract for that fat enlistment bonus if he wasn't ready to do 2 tours.    They MIGHT let you re-classify your MOS, but that is rare, and treated also on a case by case basis and usually reserved for soldiers who have physical limitations. High speed low drag soldiers don't re-class their MOS, as their commanders usually doesn't want to lose it's driving force    Your only option I can forsee if you're trying to get out of the medical brigade is run it up through your chain of command with a 4187 that you think you'd be better off serving in an infantry unit. Chances of them letting you go and re-assigning you to an infantry unit as medic is pretty high if you want to get kicked down to the line and serve with some grunts.    Your other option is throw down and try to get into a Ranger Regiment. Because of the nature of the Ranger mission, commanders usually always sign off on that. If you're a 68W they'll take you as a medic. If not, you might be able to get into the ATRRS system and get an 11B slot.    My final advice, get off yahoo answers, do some leg work, and start talking to your chain of command, up to and including your units readiness NCO, training NCO, and your commander.|`|nC6qEW1Paa	The only time I've seen people do that is in training before they left for their duty station. As long as the rank was the same, because that's how slots are filled is by rank, they could put in 4187's to swap. I'm not sure if that applies when you're already assigned to a unit, you'll have to go through you're S1(I think), or company level to find out more.|`|d6cbd4f49a6660cc733a0b7ea8151199aa	I've heard of this, but it is not an official progarm. In my case I had a female soldier who wanted to go to Korea for a 1 year tour. My Battalion Commander agreed to let her swap 1 for 1 with another BN. We got the Same MOS and Rank in exchange for her going to that unit.|`|sdNArv1Raa	Yes you can and people do it all the time. Look in the back of the Army time and you will see swaps. The thing is you have to be the same MOS and grade to do so. So swaping a infantry man for an medic will not happen unless he was able to change his MOS. In order to swap you need to contact you branch manager once you find some one in your MOS and rank that will swap. It has to be cleared by yours and there chain of command.
KXXTAi5Daa	Depending on the size of your cover (Medium or larger), the NEX or base exchange sells a metal plate that goes into the top of the over, don't bother with the cheap plastic ones.  You may also have to buy pieces for the sides of the cover.    Put the metal plate in, and stretch it out so the cover is very tight.  Spray LIBERALLY with starch.    You can then either leave it to dry, or put it into an oven on *very low* to "bake".  Be careful if you use this method, I've seen people with burn marks.  Again, very low heat.    If you don't want to use this method, you could pick up the plastic pieces to put into your cover and do the same thing, stretch it out and then spray is with starch, though it will not look as stiff.    I would also recommend making a template to put into the top of your cover, after it is starched, trace the top of the cover onto a piece of plastic (like the ones you can buy for the cover) and then place it into he top of your cover when you wear it.  If you do this though, cut a hole into the center of the plastic piece to allow your head to sit more naturally in the cover.    I would also recommend placing plastic pieces into the front and rear of the cover.  If you have rank on your cover, you will notice that the spot where you would put the front plastic piece is sewn shut, it's okay, just cut those threads, and placethe plastic piece in.  Your rank will stay in place.  This gives the cover the look of standing up, like it was just starched and formed.    Any more questions, let me know.

So far, though, at least a dozen former lobbyists have found top jobs in his administration, according to an analysis done by Republican sources and corroborated by Politico.     Obama aides did not challenge the the list of lobbyists appointed to administration jobs, but they stressed that former lobbyists comprise a fraction of the more than 8,000 employees who will be hired by the new administration. And they pointed out that before Obama made his campaign-trail promise, he issued a more complete - and more nuanced - policy on former lobbyists.|`|VteSW8nBaa	I don't think the nation has a president at this time.

He refused to prove his citizenship, when asked, or when threatened with a lawsuit.  Is he ashamed of being a US citizen, or does he not want us to know that he is not one?

Uaci5YXWaa	That depends.  In theory, there are as many rights under communism as any other system.  Plus, you have the right to a job, the right to a home, the right to free healthcare, etc.   In practice, freedom of religion, of speech and of the press suffers under communism.    Russia, Cuba and China, being the most prominent examples of Communism, have at times been extremely authoritarian.  They took away many rights (notably freedom of speech and of religion) ostensibly because they believed the rights of the individual should be subservient to the rights of the majority.  One of their core beliefs is that there must be a dictatorship of workers and religion should be discouraged.  Another is that while there is freedom of the press, people should not have to provide paper and ink to those who do not benefit society (i.e. disagree with the party).  These may have been rationalizations to maintain the monopoly on power that their communist parties enjoyed.    Russia and China have always had free (and sometimes hotly contested) elections, but in order to run for office, you must agree to abide by the rules established by the party.  They espoused democratic centralism, so criticism and self-criticism is permitted within the party, but not from outside.  In practice though, all criticism is discouraged.      The Paris Commune,  Spanish Republic and Russia prior to Trotsky/Lenin's attack on Kronstadt, were pure democracies.  This type of communism is often referred to as anarchism.  It has never lasted for long.  Social Democracy is called Revisionism by communists.|`|j9D1thMYaa	anything that makes you different then everybody else.  In communism, everyone is equal.

My thoughts on bho are this. Barack Obama is a racist.  Barack Obama asked voters at two black churches and at a Nashville rally to elect Ford, a Democrat who is trying to become the first black senator from the South in more than 100 years.    This quote was taken from Obamas book, Dreams of My Father:  There was something about him that made me wary, Obama wrote. A little too sure of himself, maybe. And white.    Its known that Obama favors racial preferences for select minorities in both the business world and academia.  With this evidence, it could be concluded that Obama, and is main supporter, Oprah, are both racist?     If not, maybe its just black pride?  Obamas church, Chicagos Trinity United Church of Christ once adopted a Black Value System. Here are their main points as written by a committee:    Commitment to God  Commitment to the Black Community  Commitment to the Black Family  Dedication to the Pursuit of Education  Dedication to the Pursuit of Excellence  Adherence to the Black Work Ethic  Commitment to Self-Discipline and Self-Respect  Disavowal of the Pursuit of Middleclassness  Pledge to make the fruits of all developing and acquired skills available to the Black Community  Pledge to Allocate Regularly, a Portion of Personal Resources for Strengthening and Supporting Black Institutions  Pledge allegiance to all Black leadership who espouse and embrace the Black Value System  Personal commitment to embracement of the Black Value System.      Would it be acceptable for any Caucasian to subscribe to a church that had dedication to the white family or strengthening and supporting white institutions? I dont think so!|`|krnrjNfmaa	Wait!

But the sooner he acts, the faster the results, whether those results are bad or good, he needs to act now because the economy won't improve on it's own.    As for voting for him again, that depends how he does in his term, overall. A vote cannot be based on a stimulus plan that needs to be introduced regardless.    Obviously if he can't accomplish anything he has set out to do, what's the point in voting for him again?

Hussein was systematically destroying those people, his people, with chemicals.  Women, children and old people.

They were in fact the perfect target. So perfect in fact that most of the now Obama administration approved of the war.    It seems strange that a regime that collapsed so completely within only days, has been able to tie up US forces for over five years. Apparently we can fight but don't know how to finish.

As for military expenditures, we could look at how many people are employed in production of a given weapon or defense system.

It will collapse by design - this stimulus package being a catalyst - foreign lenders will call in our massive debt, and we will be 'foreclosed upon'.  Bush already signed over control of the SEC to a foreign 'oversight' committee, and Obama's rush to ram-rod this stimulus will seal the deal.  It's not a conspiracy theory - it is a globalists' conspiracy against the sovereignty of the United States.|`|90ZaNZE4aa	yes it will|`|ayhDyb16aa	Watch the documentary "Freedom from Facsism" by director Aaron Russo and you will have all the answers you need.|`|de711i5Vaa	no, but every pet project that the left wing wanted to put in place is in the package.|`|A6Xjzhdaaa	no...however, there is no real alternative, and of course repugs are the last idiots in the world we should ask for answers|`|1amF7oNwaa	MOST EXPERTS SAY NO.|`|ZOXoPgJbaa	No chance in hell. Explain how giving us a few hundred bucks, and then charging us 6700 is going to be better for the American People.|`|pnpkJKvpaa	Yes, Really.|`|zt4GmLDBaa	Nope.. don't believe it for a moment    But it is going to look after Obama and hi8s friends just fine.|`|R9Iy1ERUaa	Absolutely not, unless you have a bad STD that is preventing you to work - Obama may help you out with that to get you back onto your feet & go back to work if you still have a job.|`|XzStbSPnaa	If it goes to the people that need it not the bankers that have f'd it up for us already !|`|587533eca4604b2d23fa382dc6204d59aa	It isn't supposed to.  It's to deepen and prolong the recession so we'll "need" government to "take care of us."|`|13ZMylCzaa	Fixing the economy doesn't happen overnight, or in a week, a month, or even a year.     The impact of the economic stimulus package will take at least a year to register, if not longer. Although the market and stocks might rally in the meantime.|`|c1y6cmAraa	Obama's plan will only give tax cuts to the lower and middle classes. I spent my money wisely and responsibly and yet they want to take it from me to give it to the guy that got creed and bought 8 houses and couldn't afford it? I shouldn't be getting punished for being responsible with my money.    Also I don't even understand where all this money is going to. If anyone knows, please enlighten me. I'd like to have a breakdown of all the $819 billion, where it's going, ect.     Also we shouldn't be bailing out large companies. They should file for bankrupt and reorganize.|`|G7SiH0ohaa	Lets wait and see|`|5lflypTiaa	Of course not. Giving even more money to the exact same people responsible for this Depression makes no sense. I wouldn't call it a conspiracy, just stupidity.|`|YF1To4SGaa	Uh, no, this is socialism, not stimulus. it will fail by definition.|`|5GDAiMysaa	No (stimulus will not "work")    Someone mentioned earlier that this package targets people who are, strangely enough, more inclined to vote Democratic. (unemployed, welfare recipients, etc)    The money will be given out during a time period to end 1 month after the 2010 elections.............do I smell an ulterior motive??|`|iy2amkZPaa	No.  If you look at it carefully, only a small percentage is for stimulus.  The rest is goodies for the corrupt politicians.
B4LNPldcaa	You telling child services to kiss your butt or the person that called them?     You can tell the person that called on you, whatever you would like, but I would recommend cooperating with child services. lol, they try. It is hard to know who is telling truth and who isn't. The paperwork must really suck ya think?     I do not even bother wanting to know who called them on me. Had a hospital do it once cuz I was heating with electric heaters. So, it is not like it helped or changed the situation. State loses money, so it really doesn't much care, never really did anyway, just had workers doing their red tape paperwork jobs. Only those individuals that want to care, actually do. Don't expect much, and don't worry bout it, especially if you know your innocent.|`|0JL3Mg78aa	Your attitude will get you in a lot of trouble.  This may not be a warranted check, but they have the right to do it whether or not you get any state or county assistance.  Just be pleasant, answer their questions, tell them you suspect someone called to be malicious, and let it go.|`|vGu6bcR9aa	Whether or not you get state assistance is irrelevant.    If you tell them to kiss your a** they'll return with the cops and remove your children pending investigation. Right there. Right then. Not kidding.    "You will allow them...." Umm...in terms of investigating accusations of abuse you are in NO position to 'allow' them anything. They will do pretty much as they please in order to find out if the truth.    Be kind, be polite, be cooperative and you'll be fine. Give them any attitude or hostility or obstruct the investigation in any way and you'll find out just how much latitude the state has in all this.|`|XNfjaPaSaa	If they get a complaint, they legally have to investigate it and you legally have to allow it - and not cooperating will only make them more suspicious that there is something going on.  If there really isn't anything wrong they should determine that and that should be the end of it. If they do think something's going on, they are legally authorized to do what they think is necessary to protect the kids, up to and including taking them out of the home.
PQs5Rxm5aa	If killing 1000 animals means the cure to cancer then im all for it, PETA are a religious cult that has the logical reasoning of a cow.|`|sOaqLLS6aa	PETA and the people who support it are stupid, They want animal liberation, FULL animal liberation, meaning animals should rome free and live how they see fit, but this means we would have to lay down some laws for these animals, do they seriously think animals will understand???|`|4eb0e2f9d5b148fde3255d87f69f396daa	PETA like any other special interest group tends to go too far.  Although, I am all for the prevention of cruelty to animals and believe PETA could serve a purpose, they are way out of control.  Their behavior is off the chain.  It is just one more example of someone taking their beliefs and shoving them down someone else's throat.    "Causes" for many people become their religion and they have a very hard time drawing the line and do not realize it when they have crossed it.
f3pRhrAdaa	Sure just call 800-600-4ICE and they will help you right OUT.
WR3JgCxPaa	No.
m5J36D28aa	You can thank the Republicans for that wide divide.  They have been totally nonconstructive since GWBush was asked to leave.|`|AA10546011	The Republicans I know aren't bitter, but they're concerned.|`|bmL7Ryw2aa	You haven't even began to see bitter.|`|6874b4a9b2e07ebd35f4e979f869b2d4aa	Because bush promised to lead them to the promise land and instead led them to the poor house. Notice how many "wealthy hard working" Republicans answered your question in the middle of a work day?|`|23bgwpD1aa	There not, just not happy with the way our government is acting.|`|B7mf9Chyaa	I am far from bitter.  Wanna see bitter, Liberals are still whining like little girls over the 2000 election. My business is still sound, I am making money, a lot off the books.  Sending money to off shore accounts.  Probably be completely retired in another year.  Then I shall sit on a beach, have the maid deliver little umbrella drinks and laugh at the fools that suffer under the Obama dictatorship.|`|Cl2VHwVQaa	I think it is the liberals that are so bitter.  That is why when you see democratic congressmen on TV, they all have those frown lines on their foreheads.      I am pretty happy with my life.  I work and earn my own money, I have health insurance, I make my house payments on time, I have a great family, I have nothing to be bitter about, except I do have a little bitterness against those who want to take more of my hard earned money away.|`|GiUTgnHMaa	finally, someone who sees the light!!!|`|ZeqD0Oegaa	Yes this nation is extremely divided.  We aren't bitter, we are frustrated at how stupid liberals are and we are getting tired of cleaning up and fixing your mistakes.  We know what is ahead of us.  Just wish liberals would get even a small clue.|`|9d324139a59bc1e69bcfeb3145f249efaa	Of course it is, extremists would always rather burn the building down than allow someone else to decide the color.  After years of having it all their own way the GOP is one the outside and they resent it, that's to be expected.|`|RyCeSxa3aa	Of course the nation is that divided... Republicans had a good shot at becoming the wealthy noble class in what was to be a newly formed monarchy of corporate control.    But since they botched that up and instead lead the nation to disaster, they're pissed.    Now they have to deal with ideas like "people are equal" and the US Constitution ...    If i were a republican, id probably grab my bible and throw it at such liberal ideas...|`|Ca8i226Xaa	We are bitter because we got a far left Socialist president that the liberal MSM failed to expose. Yes, we are a very divided nation, and the liberals are as bad or worse than the cons when it comes to attacking others. Have you forgotten the vicious attacks against Sarah Palin and her family already. Liberals are still attacking her, and Rush, Hannity, Ann Coulter, Bill O'Reilly, Glenn Beck, Lou Dobbs, Michelle Malkin, Laura Ingraham, etc.    I've been following politics for almost 40 years now and the libs in the USA are just as vicious, mean and vindictive as the cons, no doubt about it.|`|AA11702773	Furious, not bitter.    You LIKE our financial sector put under Brussels and Obama giving the IMF special drawing rights on OUR central bank?    http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/po...
