He bagan pushing a large boulder at the edge of the cliff.  Others said "Don't push it.  It could fall and crush the house."  He stopped, confused that his actions could cause a problem.      His friend Dick came up and said "Come on George, don't be a weenie.  Let's push this boulder over the cliff."      So George and Dick pushed and pushed until finally the boulder went rolling down the cliff.  They walked away laughing.      As the boulder roared down the cliff, another boy named Barry rushed out and tried to stop the boulder, but George and Dick just continued laughing saying "That's not how to do it."      Barry did everthing he could to stop the boulder, but it was too late and the boulder crushed the house.      All of the friends of George and Dick started pointing at Barry saying "It's his fault...he didn't stop the boulder."      Whose fault was it?

It's an hour and a half to the university and it's below freezing with snow and ice on the ground, and this professor has canceled class three times in two weeks, so twice I've gone and he hasn't even been there.

20090304095617AAFCrH3	Education & Reference;Words & Wordplay	Is There Something Wrong with me ?	Whats wrong with me?           Hi I am 16 almost. I have no confidence at all. It isnt because of abuse or a difficult life; my life has been fine mostly and I have never been bullied, not properly anyone and not for very long. Lately, well for some time now, I have been worrying about something and I have to ask because I cant talk about it and I feel scared to even mention it. I dont know whether I am, for want of a better word because this sounds horrible, "normal". I dont know whether I am just awkward and weird or whether there is something wrong with me. I dont need help or anything; I'm not particularly clever but I do rubbish academically. I do get stared at, but it could be because i am ugly, or because I am so self consious, or because I probably look miserable most of the time or..I just dont know and its killing me.    I am actually quite normal at home, but outside I just get so self consious, and even if people arent staring, I convince myself they are, and I get more and more unhappy until I look so uncomfortable I get stared at MORE, and it goes on. This happens every day, at school.    Please dont worry about being nice or gentle. That is why I dont talk aboutit to anyone, they would lie in order to be nice.    But I am really awkward, and I'm one of those people that you dont even consider liking in that way. And I am treated like more of a pet than a friend. I dont mind, because I'm grateful that I have any friends, but I cant cope with this anymore.    Can anyone help? I need to know whether there is something wrong with me or if the problems start inside my head. Or both even.   I just look in the mirrow sometimes and think oh my god know wounder why guys dont like me, also i september i started playing the drums, at first I was really into it but now (Im not jelous) there a nother guy who been playing 4 like a year and he's like super good and just sits down and everything he play sound note perfect, but when i sit at the drum kit i feel embrassed and i dont want to play sometimes it stupide but i cry during class (in the loo) and like i hate it because i feel like im making a scene, when i say i dont want to play. oh is there something wrong i swear :(

20090304093152AAWlLqW	Education & Reference;Other - Education	Is this application essay any good?	I'm applying for an acting program at an arts academy, this essay is part of the application, which asks "Why do you want to attend the *** Arts Academy? How will you benefit from an *** Arts education?"   This is my reply, any feedback would be amazing, thank you!      Acting has always been my deepest passion. This is not a fact that developed slowly and gradually as I got over; it was a sudden, crashing epiphany that illuminated my life in the moment I first adapted a role. I remember vividly the first film I saw: The Wizard of Oz. I remember wanting to be Judy and discover those sparkling shoes, to fall asleep in a field of posies and triumph over the bad witch. I remember my mother letting me borrow her old Dorothy costume my grandmother had sewn for her in elementary school so my friends and I could put on a neighborhood production. And of course I remember the instant I was singing “Somewhere Over the Rainbow” I would never love anything else more than acting. I immediately asked to join a youth theatre in town and since Dorothy, I have been a host of other wonderful characters: Hermia, Molly, a calf, Cindy Lou Who, and many more each precious in individual ways. It has only taken me all these years to apply for enrollment at an arts academy because I felt that my father would rather see me applying myself to a more conservative interest. My father was born and raised in a small town in Georgia. He always knew he would have to apply himself to an assuredly profitable profession if he wanted to provide his own children with opportunities he did not have. He is now a successful radiologist in Orlando, Florida and a spectacular dad, who is currently providing me with the opportunity to study in Ireland for my junior year of high school. When I suggested participating in a program to study abroad, he regarded this decision as an opportunity to discover my true passion, decide goals and figure out how to reach them. He has since been insisting that I follow my dreams. I had known all along in secret that all I could ever want to do is act, so I researched academies that offer acting programs, and *** came up consistently as a fantastic school with an impeccable reputation for molding artists into the best that they can be. I knew right away that *** is where I need to be. When I revealed this to my father during a visit over winter break, he was not ecstatic, but could clearly see my determination in the matter and has been very supportive of my striving for acceptance to the school.    There are so many ways I could benefit just from attending the school. I will use the training to my advantage in every way to learn, and grow as an actor. I will be able to absorb and use all the knowledge bestowed upon me during the course at the academy to develop my skill in the performing arts. I am inexplicably determined and passionate about acting, and strive for no less than excellence in each and every performance big or small. I may never be Judy Garland, but with the resources that *** provides, I have no doubt I could come close.

I am scared of feeling so anxious I will be unable to communicate with other students making me feel like I am hopeless.

20090303231617AAxqWzf	Education & Reference;Primary & Secondary Education	How do I fight an english grade?	SORRY IF LONG. SHOULD BE EASY TO READ.       To be honest, I'm not the perfect English student.    However, I currently believe my school's English department is corrupt.       I've receive many C's and C-'s on essays that I have spent on average 7 hours of my time writing and editing. The head of the English department is a teacher which I have had twice and has never liked me. I think she has never liked me because I'm not a conformist in class. The definition of non-conformist in this text is one who does not share the same views and opinions as others do. My work, opinions, and views shouldn't be discriminated upon.      Recently I turned in a story and received a B-. I'm a very creative thinker and can produce some of the best and funniest stories in class. I was appalled to receive such a low grade on a 12 page story which I had spent 11 hours writing and editing. What upset me the most was other people who turned in their first draft late, and received better grades than me. I was 1 of 3 people who turned the assignment in on time.      The class believes I should have deserved a better grade. They believe it was the best story anyone in class produced and read out loud.       So, I had the English teacher reevaluate my grade.       She sent me an email that supposively said she gave the paper to another English teacher and let her grade it. The other English teacher said I deserved a C+. The emails should have indicated that both of them were forwarded from the English teacher that graded my work but it didn't. There was no name for the other English teacher.       I have complained about this before to the school and board. Yet, I was shut down. I would have left the school but my English grades prevented me from getting into another private school.      BTW, I'm in 11th grade and all three years of high school English I've been screwed in.      I feel that I should just give up my extra effort I put in English and concentrate more on my strengths (Math and Science). However, colleges will find my application less appealing to them.      What makes me sad is when I write a paper that takes me 6 hours long, I would have gotten the same grade if I put 1 hour into it.      What should I do?

ESSAY: NATIVE AMERICAN CULTURE      Here is your goal for this assignment:   Write an essay on the culture of a present-day Native American tribe of your choice       Choose one of the present-day tribes of Native Americans and write a report on their culture. Write about their ancestors; their ways of meeting the basic needs of food, shelter, and clothing; and their economic system. Write about their values and beliefs and about the roles of the men and women in their society. Include a section about their enemies and their friends. Describe some of the tools, utensils, or other artifacts the people made and used in the past. Use an encyclopedia to help you tell how they were alike and  how they were different.   The Crow are a tribe of Native Americans who belong to Siouan language family and live in the Great Plains culture area. Their name for themselves, Apsaalooke (pronounced opp-sah-loh-kay), was misinterpreted by early explorers as “people of the crows,” or simply “crow.” It actually meant “children of the large beaked bird,” a nickname given to them by their neighboring tribe, the Hidatsa. The bird that they are named after, which was described as a fork-tailed bird resembling a blue jay or a magpie, may now be extinct.                       The Crow first encountered Europeans in 1743 near the town of Hardin, Montana. The men they encountered were two Frenchman brothers, the La Verendryes. The brothers called the Indians beaux hommes, which meant “handsome men.” The Indians called the Canadians baaschaiile, which meant “person with yellow eyes.”      The Crow were originally an agricultural tribe. They lived in permanent villages along the upper Missouri River, living peacefully alongside their neighboring tribe, the Hidatsa. The Crow moved westward toward the Yellowstone River area (east of the Rocky mountains) sometime before the early seventeen hundreds. On the Plains, they became nomads, following the great herds of buffalo on horse back. They lived in portable tipis and practiced the Sun Dance, a religion also practiced by other Indian tribes. They grew a single crop, tobacco, which played a religious role in the secret Crow Tobacco Society. One other religion they practiced is the Crow Way.      Crow woman were in charge of the home. They cooked and cleaned, and when the tribe moved, they took their family’s tipi apart and put it back together again. The men were warriors, responsible for finding food and keeping their family safe. The men used powerful bow and arrows, war clubs, spears, and hide shields as weapons. Sometimes a Crow woman, especially a widow, would ride into battle or even become a chief, but this was rare. Both men and woman took part in storytelling, artwork, music, and traditional medicine. Crow children mostly helped around their camp. They had more work to do then they do now, just like colonial children. They did have dolls, toys, and games to play, also like colonial children.     Crow women wore long deerskin dresses. Crow men wore breechcloths with leather leggings and buckskin shirts. Both men and women wore moccasins on their feet.  A Crow lady's dress or warrior's shirt was fringed and often decorated with porcupine quills, beadwork, and elk teeth. Later, Crow people adapted European costume such as cloth dresses and vests, which they also decorated with beading and traditional ornaments. Today, Crow only wear traditional attire on special occasions like dances and weddings.        Crow Indian leaders sometimes wore the long warbonnets that Plains Indians are famous for. Traditionally, Crow people only cut their hair when they were in mourning. Crow men sometimes made their hair even longer by weaving horsehair into it. Some Crow chiefs had hair so long it trailed on the ground. Crow men and women both wore their hair either loose or in two braids, but Crow men often styled the front of their hair into pompadours or other styles, and sometimes wrapped their braids in fur. Crow women didn't consider their hair as important as some Plains Indian women did. In the 1800's, many Crow women started to cut their hair to shoulder length, but Crow men continued to grow theirs as long as possible. The Crows also painted their faces for special occasions. They used different patterns for war paint, religious ceremonies, and festive decoration.    The Crows traded regularly with other tribes of the Great Plains and the Western Plateau. Some of their favorite trading partners included the Mandan and Flathead Salish tribes. These tribes usually communicated using the Plains Sign Language.       The Crow also fought wars with other tribes. Plains Indian tribes treated war differently than European countries did. They didn't fight over territory but instead to prove their courage, and so Plains Indian war parties rarely fought to the death or destroyed each other's villages. Instead, their war customs included counting

I just don't know if my not being a dependent of my parents any longer will hurt my chances.  Any insight?

However, i was wondering how much the top uk universities e.g. kcl, lse, durham, warwick and places like that look at GCSE that much cos some people say stuff like you need at least 5A*s to study a subject like law at places like that.

Hi there, I'm in year 11 and soon i will have to decide which A levels I will be taking. I have already decided that I want to take maths, biology and chemistry for sure, however im a bit unsure about what else to take.   As my favourite subject is maths i thought i could take further maths as an AS (most dental schools only accept further maths as an AS), however many people have told me to take physics as now it is the future...i generally don't really mind physics and im good at it.   However others have told me to take an English based subject to show how i am a varied student.........then teachers have told me to take critical thinking to prepare me for dental school entry exams....   Honestly i don't want to 'waste' my time with subjects that i need to write loads of essays on when i can be using that time studying my priority subjects.   I am doing well at school and am predicted all As and A*s so I was thinking of taking 3 A levels and 2 As or 4 A levels and 1 As.......but then i get people telling me that it's too much and that i should take 3 A levels and 1 As   All i know is that i want to do dentistry and i will take anything to better my chances of being accepted.      IM SO CONFUSED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!... PLEASE HELP!!!!

20090304110302AApHxrY	Education & Reference;Teaching	I thought my teacher was a nasty person but today i realized that shes a really nice person! is this normal?	My teacher is really strict during the class setting like she sends people out for just uttering a few words she says you can underachieve in the corridor. I sympathize with the students that get sent out because usually they are just answering a question from someone and they get sent out. I thought she was a nasty person and i did my best to avoid confrontation or talking to her because she does like to humiliate people in front of the class if you interupt her or backchat.      Then today coursework was due and outside of the whole stress of teaching in class a few students including me asked her if we could work in her room and she was really nice about it. Then as i was doing it she was speaking to this women who's a trainee in teaching and is observing classes so she can get a feel of the profession teaching. She was so nice to her just advising her on how she gets respect from classes etc. And i was thinking what a nice person i thought she was nasty and obnoxious but today i saw a real nice side of her she was just nice and friendly around us and the trainee. She was just explaining basically the laws of teaching and i was impressed i never really thought she was that much of a nice person.       Do you think that she's acts all hard and strict due to the stress of teaching and when she's out of the teaching frame of mind shes kind laid back and understading. That's how she came off to me. Is this normal for this to happen with teachers and do all teachers act strict but are nice at heart?      Thanks sorry for the long post!

20090304105927AAJmTfY	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	What types of colleges could I get into? I have a lowish GPA, but good test scores and decent ECs.?	I am a Junior in High School, And I really have no clue what types of colleges I should be applying to. I get cnflicting advice from Parents, Teachers, and Guidance Councelors, so maybe you guys can be more unbiased. What types of colleges do you think I could get into? Do I even have a shot at a place like Brown or Columbia?   GRADES:   My GPA is medeocre, as of the beginning of the year it was a 3.56, weighted. I have taken all honors courses for all of High school, and by the time I graduate I will have taken 4 AP Classes (This year: AP US History; Next year: AP European History, AP English Literature, and AP Biology) I have not gotten a C on any final grades, but they are generally low A's to B's. This year they are improving though, and I am getting more A's than B's, So that might raise my GPA.   TEST SCORES:   So far I have only taken my PSATs, with a 72 in Critical Reading, a 67 in Math, and a 70 in Writing, putting me in the 98th percentile of all high school juniors. I am signed up for next saturdays SATs, and I am fairly confident about it.    EXTRA CURRICULARS:   Key Club, Leo Club, (both volunteering) and Art Club, though I havent had any leadership positions. I am also starting a Model UN Club at my School. I have been in three different High Schools, and was in Drama for my freshman and sophomore years, but my current school doesnt have a very good drama program. I havent been involved in any one thing for all of high school. I take art classes outside of school twice a week, and have had the opportunity to display my work and even sell it, which is exciting. Im also really actively involved in my church. I held a part time job last summer working as a photographer, and I do alot of community service. I am hoping to start volunteering at a hostpital once a week.    OTHER:   I spent a semester living in Japan, which I have heard looks good to colleges. My father is a commander in the Navy, I dont know if that makes a difference at all.    This summer I am doing a Student Ambassador trip to Europe: England, France, Germany, Switzerland, The Netherlands, and Belgium.      I applied to a program at Clarkson University that will allow me to skip my Senior Year of High school and begin college a year early. If I were to go, I would finish my Freshman year of college there, and then transfer to a different college for the next three years. Im not 100% certain about whether I am going to go, if accepted. Im not sure if skipping out my senior year is worth it, and if It would make a difference to admissions counselors. So I guess my second question is, Do you think colleges would look positively on a student leaving after their junior year to start college? And how much do you think it would increase my chances of getting into a good school?      Sorry its so long.

Hello         today in a class people started to call me a name. It was really shocking. It was something to do with my past when i was very young, Very embarrassing. i'm nearly 17 and in 6th form. I ignored it at the time. Then in the next class they started again. I felt like a dark cloud had come over me. you see these are the worst lads in our year, the drug dealers, the ones who even louder people get worried around. I couldn't handle it so i went right to the 6th form teacher. And i had never shown anyone that side of me. I was angry, upset and i explained that i couldn't deal with this if it went on and yes i did get quite emotional for a second in there. I wrote down what was going on and they were dealt with. I made sure my name wouldn't come up in the conversation the teacher had with them. I went to see her later on. I was very upset, i just felt like nothing would ever be good for me in school again. She told me that they wont do it again. But Knowing bully's whats new? they always start up again. She got the head of 6th form involved also and they had a warning. I am not mean to anyone, i'm friendly. For the rest of the day i didn't see them, but i am very nervous for when i next see them. Do you think they will continue? I have a horrible headache from thinking about all this. I can't deal with going to 6th form and getting called names all the time and getting embarissed.Any advice? thanks for reading

My problem is I can't seem to be bothered to go to class, the drive to school is about a hour (2 hours round trip). All I basically do when I get in class is just sit there, no teaching really goes on and I learned all this stuff when I was 13... it's web design by the way. I don't see the point in having to drive that far when i'm just going to sit there and then leave 10mins later after attendance is taken. I can't stand driving but it's the closest school around me, its more of the drive rather than the class.      I don't even think they go by the attendance policy, I've went to class once and I have a A average in the class still, your grade is suppose to drop when you don't go for 3 days, I've missed a total of 6 weeks      I don't even see the point in going anymore, I can take my tests online at home so whats the deal?

A support assistant with autistic pupils was punched and hit repeatedly by an 18 year old autistic student when he went in to an outburst. When she questioned is it right that this is tolerated she was told "that's just the risks of the job you should realise that" Surely they have some rights to defend themselves? surely they should have some form of training to deal with these types of outburst? I understand it is a touchy subject due to the nature of autism but support assistants are not payed to take beatings from pupils.

What I am seeing from the Derby Council, they said to increase 15p when my parents pay ￡8.50 for the school meals and they now starting to increase price on children meals in school.   Its especially credit crunch and also during dinner, the dinner ladies don't give much to children to eat during lunch times, the only give a plate with 1 sausage, 1 small pieces of pork, chips and a little gravy on top, when you ask the dinner ladies for one more sausage or one more piece of pork and little bit more gravy, they refuse to give it to you and then after that, the end of the lunch hour, they chuck the food in the bin, how wasteful is that?   The people cannot afford to pay for school meals no more and the council just keep rising their prices up on food and saying healthy food and high quality food when it isn't high quality food, i mean, its not high quality enough.      But yeah, is it right to actually increase the price on children meals at school?      When I look at the full council meeting detail and here is the website to the school meal prices increasing:  http://www.derby.gov.uk/PressReleases/pr...       and here is the full council meeting details:  http://cmis.derby.gov.uk/CMISWebPublic/M...       This means that nobody actually went to the meeting of school meals.      Do you think that the government only wants money and they are not actually helping the people at all?      and also why aren't the school allowing the children to come out of school to eat during lunch time?
