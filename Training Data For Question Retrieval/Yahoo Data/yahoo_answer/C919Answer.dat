AA11164759	Yes you can. Although there are some pitfalls. Certain mileage is not allowed, such as home>work travel etc. Also the rate drops once you have done over 10,000 miles a year. But otherwise, you can make a claim for your unpaid miles ( ie the amount of total miles@40p less the amount you've received). This reduces your taxable income and you may then be entitled to a refund for the year. Its probably easiest to do this on a Tax Return. <br>  If youre a basic rate taxpayer, and are missing out on 200 miles a week, say 46 weeks a year your tax refund might be as much as ï¿¡700. <br>  It might therefore be worth getting hold of an accountant to claim this for you.|`|GWCXuFknaa	<a href="HTTP://WWW.STYLISHDUDES.COM" rel="nofollow">HTTP://WWW.STYLISHDUDES.COM</a><br>  We are wholesaler of Nike Jordan and Other Shoes in China.

dyzUHrUVaa	Well, group universal products have a selection of different products within themselves. So think of it like a mutual fund investing group. You have a 401k plan that you want to invest with so you can put so much money into this plan but you have a selection of different products within this one product.

If you were an attorney and you had to write a legal paper and you were doing this for a client, and you put in your contract that "you can smoke as much pot as you like cause the government cannot do anything about it" this would probably get a few judges a little upset. Obviously this isn't true, and if the client wanted to sue you for this, you would need insurance to cover your ignorant ***, this is what you would need errors and omissions insurance for.

Today, more than ever, consumers are using the Internet to read reviews and find new businesses nearby. Chances are that your competition is taking advantage of these opportunities already, so starting to increase the visibility of your site can only make you more competitive in your market.<br>  <br>  While pay per click services are growing in popularity, to get the most cost effective return you should first explore opportunities in free online advertising. With free advertising, you can expand your reach on the web without having to worry about whether your marketing campaign will be cost effective.<br>  <br>  There are several types of free online ads, including placement directed and search optimized advertising. A placement based campaign allows you to target specific sites to promote your services such as free online classifieds like Craigslist. Free classifieds provide you with the ability to promote your service and link back to your website. since you can target your ad locally, you can reach customers who are nearby - this is especially important if you are providing a professional service. There are also plenty of opportunities to promote at other free classified venues such as city forums, niche sites like Kijiji, as well as commenting on local blogs. Make sure to keep both your site and ad placements professional, which can help convert potential customers and begin to earn their trust; you can also improve your conversion rate with special offers or coupons. Always install an analytics package on your website so that you know the sources of referring tracking, and can evaluate the success of your campaigns.<br>  <br>  Another form of free advertising is placing a local business listing in Google. By inputting your local address, along with details on your company, you can ensure that you'll show up prominently when consumers search for your company by name. This will become increasingly important as your company becomes better known through brand development. When constructing your web page, you should also focus on the terms that are most likely to relate to your vertical. For example, if you offer home remodeling services in Los Angeles, you'll want to offer how-to tutorials for local remodeling services on your site that will help draw visitors from search engines.<br>  <br>  Across all of your promotion channels, you'll want to maintain a focus on converting potential searchers into leads and converting those leads into customers. By starting your online advertising campaign today, you can increase your customer base and profitably grow your firm with less risk.|`|3HtZnFEpaa	There are a few methods for totally FREE advertising.  Keep in mind though, you will have to put a little time into it.  One of the most popular is using free Adforums.  Freeadforum.com and others allow you to post your banners or classifieds at no cost.  There are thousands of these boards and you can post to each of them. This takes some time because you usually have to register for each board, one at a time.  None-the-less, it can pay dividends.  <br>  <br>  Along the same lines, you may want to consider Craig's list.  Find the Craig's list online for your area and post away.  It's usually free and can definitely help you promote your business.<br>  <br>  The second major type of free advertising is the use of ad exchanges.  In this type of advertising method, you place someone else's ads on your site in exchange for placing your ad on their site (throughout the network).  Whether you are using Thetextadexchange.com or a banner exchange, you're sure to reach a large number of people.  The key is simply to get started and begin posting your ad.|`|ckNgtP91aa	I have been running a viral traffic site for some time now and my users are pretty happy with it.

I don't know if the two of you will have enough income to qualify in Southern California, but explore all options.|`|buDbNa57aa	recently my husband tried to buy a house and we had some money down and with his income he qualified for an fha loan. He ended up getting denied because he had to show 3 tradelines which are open credit accts. He only had a car payment  and rent but  he couldnt provide anything else proving he makes his payments ontime. Nimo, cable, and all the other bills were in my name. I wasnt going to be on the mortgage so he couldnt use is. Right now lending guidelines are tough and if you dont have any open credit accts it will be very difficult to get a mortgage|`|fwkxK2cCaa	Since you mentioned that your husband is in the Navy he may be able to use the VA home loan that he is entitled to, provided that the home that you both want to buy is not over the maximum amount that he could qualify for (otherwise, you will have to pay the difference)  Since you both are still young and hadn't really established any credits yet, it would be a good idea to go ahead and talk to the VA office and see what the maximum loan he could be approved for.  Now, keep in mind that he is in the military and could possibly be reassigned to another part of the country when his shore or sea duty has been fulfilled.  But then again, you could always try to either rent it out or put it back on the market (just that much more of a hassle if he is due to be reassign within a short period of time)  Buying a home, especially if you're a first time buyer requires careful planning and shopping around for the best rates and locations.  If your husband do opt to use the VA home loan, the VA office will provide their own home inspecter to look everything over thoroughly before giving the go ahead with the purchase of the home.<br>  If they find anything that may need to be repaired or replaced, both major or minor, they will inform the seller and the seller will either have to fix it or bring the purchase price down....If it's too much of a major repair or if the home is not in the best of condition, the VA might even ask that you reconsider and look else where.  Good luck.|`|rnfxNYx3aa	Go talk to your local bank becasue likely that will be the only place with no credit thta you MIGHT get a loan.  You could try FHA and is your husband eligible for a VA loan.|`|tNAZ9Qr7aa	You'll have to go to the bank to find out whether you can get the loan. Bear in mind that in the current economy, banks have raised their lending standards significantly.<br>  <br>  On a side note, houses in southern california have fallen quite a bit, but they have not bottomed out yet. You don't want to get a loan and then realize a few months later that the value of the house is worth less than the original loan.
MtC3CWZraa	There are still loans to be had, theyâre just harder to get than they were a year or even six months ago. Thatâs a problem for you when trying to buy a house, but itâs also a problem for you when trying to sell a house. <br>  <br>  I would get with a real estate agent and discuss your options. I would only consider renting if thereâs a property management company in the area who will screen renters, perform maintenance, and collect rent for you. Being two hours away, it would be tough to keep up with those things yourself. <br>  <br>  Thereâs also the potential of doing a lease to purchase or rent-to-own option. A local real estate agent could futher guide you on how these situations work in your market. <br>  |`|1b2e645cebbd7dd90de171c4c8e86efeaa	well the only thing i know for sure is that like single people arent allowed to get loans. thats all i've heard as far as the banks and loans thing goes.|`|cug8GruKaa	Yes|`|ge3meKYEaa	We are moving from Philadelphia to NJ- about an hour away.<br>  1.

Buying is great right now because it's so cheap.<br>  <br>  The only thing is- can you pay off your home on what the market value is right now.  Lot of people are stuck because they paid $350 for a home that is now selling for $300- so it doesn't cover their current mortage.  You just don't want to owe money.  Throw the house up for sale and wait and see.|`|lQmbEY33aa	It's really not that hard to get a loan if you have:<br>  <br>  1) Decent credit<br>  2) A down payment (0-5%) minimum<br>  3) Currently don't own a home that you are upside down in<br>  <br>  The last one seems to be the killer for most people because they either are or can't sell it and will have to qualify with both mortgage payments counting against them if there is no lease agreement.<br>  <br>  If you can pass these three then it's the best time ever to buy a home....low rates and LOTS of homes to pick from at low prices.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

If you mean that you are paying off your credit card by direct debit with a set amount each month then again contact your credit card company to ask them to stop drawing it and you will then have to pay when the bill comes in each month|`|UAW1U3Uoaa	You cannot set up a direct debit on a credit card onl a bank account, if it is a direct debit from your bank account you can simply ask your bank to cancel the direct debit. If it is coming off your credit card then it is not a direct debit, the company is making a seperate charge to your credit card each month, it is not really the card companies job to stop the payment and in the first instance you should contact whatever the company is that is charging you and tell them to stop. Your statement will give some detail about who the payment is to, look them up on Google.

Get the forms in the first place and take them home for your mum to sign. You will need to have an appt with Abbey so that they can go through the forms with you.You will also need to add some money to the account. Then you will have a card to withdraw money from your account. But it is not a debit card. It can be arranged that regular amounts go into your account eg a parent can arrange a direct debit transfer at regular intervals from their account if they know your new Abbey account number and sort code. If your mother has a bank that she phones up to do transactions, then this is just a phone call for her. An example of a bank that does this is First Direct. My daughter finds this arrangement suits her and she can get the money out of her account when she wants to spend it.  <br>  <br>  On line surveys vary and not all will give money - they can give points eg one reward system I know pays into BA airmiles if you get 500 points. If your friends do this already and get paid, then ask them for more details about the accounts.

dyzUHrUVaa	Not sure if you have looked up on google what the definition of self funded insurance exactly means but I look at this from a standpoint of. When you have company insurance, the business has to typically pay a portion of the premium for the employees. Usually the company has to pay a minimum of 50 percent of the employees insurance benefits and they can opt to pay up to all the insurance premium. Problem is with a small company, they cannot afford to pay so much in cost for insurance so each individual in the company has to purchase their own insurance coverage if they want health coverage. Now when they speak of old economy, you have to remember that most companies in the older days were factories and to have more then 1000 employees was very common so they would go self funded insurance under 1000 versus 100 in todays world. Now, the only thing else I could think this could be making reference to is a cafeteria plan. Which is the company pools a certain amount of pre taxed dollars out of each employees paycheck to create a insurance pool for each employee, which at certain points in time, the company would go self funded cause they participated a installed balance to keep the pool at a certain level until the input was matched by employee with holdings, then it would go self funded. So depending on what you are studying, it could be a couple of things.

<br>      While the above table is instructive, and will hopefully help you to understand how compound interest works, there's a shortcut to getting the final answer, that works like this...<br>  <br>      Notice that at each compounding step above, the new principal can be found by applying this formula:<br>  <br>      NewPrincipal = CurrentPrincipal Ã (1 + r)<br>  <br>      where r is your interest rate at the time of compounding, in this case 2% (or 0.02 in the calculations).<br>  <br>      As an example, look at the first compounding step:<br>  <br>      142799999.94=140000000.00 Ã (1 + 0.02).<br>  <br>      And the second:<br>  <br>      145655999.94=142800000.00 Ã (1 + 0.02).<br>  <br>      In fact, the whole compound interest amount boils down to multiplying (1+r), or (1+0.02), times your original principal 20 times (5 years at 4 compouding(s) per year).<br>  <br>      Mathematically though, this is equivalent to multiplying your orginial principal by the factor (1+0.02)20.<br>  <br>      If we do this, we'll get that your final amount is:<br>  <br>      140000000.00 Ã (1+0.02)20=208032633.61<br>  <br>      Which is the same result obtained in the step-by-step analysis.

sI3krJULaa	It depends on your income.  If you are within the income range and had taxable income (meaining your deducitons and credits didn't bring it down to zero), then you would receive the full 1,200 that you should have received last year (since it's based on this year's taxes).<br>  <br>  Here's what the IRS says about how much you'll receive: "The payment is equal to the taxpayerâs net income tax liability but no more than $1,200 for a married couple filing a joint return. The minimum payment is $600 for a married couple filing jointly."<br>  <br>  So, as long as you made at least $3,000, you'll receive $600.  If you don't have to pay tax, though, then that's all you'll get.  If you do have to pay tax, you'll get $600 more dollars (unless your liability is under 600, but more than 0, at which point you'll receive whatever your total liability is).<br>  <br>  I know it's confusing, but I hope that helps. :0)|`|cb1c8e5fcd8492bc3787fd1b614481ecaa	There is a form you fill out in the tax package that computes a stimulus refund based on last year's pay.

The net result is that you can only receive one full payment.<br>  <br>  There will also be a $250 payment in May to all people receiving Social Security.

If that is the case, then it counts as though you had received since the funds were actually credited toward a debt that you owed.|`|AA10469473	You'd fall under the "married couple" rules if you file a joint return.  But that doesn't mean you get $1200.  The amount you get for the two of you is at least $600 total.  If your net tax liability for the year is more than $600 then you'd get the amount of the tax you paid, with a maximum of $1200 for the two of you.|`|jWO10NN5aa	Don't expect anything.

As an employer myself, the main thing I recoil from in letter such as this is people puffing themselves up without having much evidence to back it up. So I would suggest cutting out a few of the marvellous things you say about yourself and give a few examples to back up what remains behind, something to break down the monotony of the continuous praise you give yourself. Some examples - how did your school recognise your brilliance? Give an example of how you improved your skills on a project, what your learned and what you feel you need to learn as a result of the experience. You could also give some evidence that you know something about the company - check online maybe - and how it suits what you're looking for. Why do you want to be involved in marketing their particular products, for example? Oh and try and avoid the 'to whom it may concern; bit. Find out who deals with the recruiting and address it to her/him. I do wish you well.|`|WoRaXE73aa	I think your letter is good.

Send the P60 to the tax office with a covering letter to state that was your only job, and you were not working from 6 April 2008, until you started that job.  Give your National Insurance Number if you have one, and your full name & address.  Ask for a repayment.<br>  <br>  If you'd rather not write a letter, print off form P91 which you can get here:  <a href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/pdfs/p91_bs5_02.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/pdfs/p91_bs5_02.p...</a>  Fill in your name and address at the top of the front page.

eU2Hg0Deaa	My boyfriend was in this situation a while back, <br>  <br>  Your first step is to do some research into courses offerred by local colleges, then get your name down to enrol, <br>  <br>  Usually they will require you to find your own placement, the way we did it was to phone up plumbing companies in the yellow pages...<br>  <br>  If some one is interested in taking you on then great... if not don't worry, the college will usually help you out, or you will meet others on the course (who will have placements).... they can get you in touch with their employers. <br>  <br>  Once thing though, as an apprentice even at 19, there will be no minimum wage, so essentially your employer can pay you what they like, so I strongly advise you to do some research into grants and funds. <br>  <br>  good luck . x<br>  <br>  Also the college course my bf did was run by a company JTL, <br>  This sirte might be helpful, <a href="http://www.jtltraining.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.jtltraining.com/</a>|`|AHCelSY1aa	You should post this question in careers.

e9f68812f71cca804ea0d7931ce5e819aa	I was actually looking into this the other night... It basically seems you've got two options - buying gold coins - such as sovereigns or Krugerrands (try <a href="http://www.goldline.co.uk)" rel="nofollow">http://www.goldline.co.uk)</a> - or buying bullion bars. Turns out you can actually buy bullion online (check out <a href="http://www.bullionvault.com/#fdlowe)" rel="nofollow">http://www.bullionvault.com/#fdlowe)</a> They basically store it in a vault on your behalf, but the gold is legally yours - your free to sell it when and how you want, the advantage of this way is basically you have security and the integrity of the gold is guaranteed for future purchasers - they know it's not been tampered with or anything, and to me it basically seems easier to carry out transactions online :)|`|nzQw5jqXaa	There are many ways to buy gold and silver. These include bullion in bars and coins, jewelry, numismatic coins and even exchange traded funds.<br>  All of these are good but before you buy anything you should ask yourself exactly what your purpose for buying the gold is. Buying numismatic coins and antiques requires specialized knowledge and you could be very unpleasantly surprised when you sell them. I suggest you buy a bullion coin from the US Mint because the coins are easy to buy and sell and they are very beautiful.|`|F7iO45nMaa	There are several ways to purchase gold and silver such as: bullion coins, bullion bars, legal tender coins and collectibles.

The only advice I would give you is to continue to look for work in accountancy.

HxsvpxDqaa	Honestly, its more about the hype for the product these days, than the product itself sometimes. What i would recommend is, dont try and sell the poster using unknown sources, or on eBay, because people dont usually expect to find such stuff on it, and you could end up getting a lot less than you set out for, or its real value.<br>  <br>  Since i have not seen the posters, I can not comment on their real value, but something from that time ought to fetch considerable money. Try to create good hype, try to link famous names that you might find in its history. Use the barbershop's name if its important. Use the pageants name, and whoever won it. See if the beer is a historic icon. Try to find out who painted the posters, and see if those people were famous, or if they painted other famous posters of stuff.<br>  <br>  Try stuff like this out, and create hype for it. Who knows, you might even end up auctioning it for a lot more than you expect ;)<br>  <br>  oh and yes, its always better to hold on to such items ... the older they are, the better. but the key thing is, they have to be in good condition. there is a point up to where an object looks antique, and then if you go over it, it starts decreasing in value.

sI3krJULaa	You have nothing to worry about.  The IRS has nothing to do with sales tax.  That's a state-run tax (for instance, here in CA, it's the state board of equalization).  To further help alleviate your fears, it's the company that sold your customer the goods that is on the hook for sales tax reporting, since they're the ones who are supposed to withhold sales tax from every purchase and then send it on the state quarterly.  So you are in no way involved in any transaction involving authorities of any kind.  Your customer made the purchase and paid sales tax on it.  It doesn't matter what address he used.<br>  <br>  So, relax and have a nice weekend. :0)

3HtZnFEpaa	Nestle's brand strategy is pretty common among consumer products companies.  The two types of brand strategies are promoting a single brand or "house of brands".  Under a single brand strategy, a business uses every customer touch point to reinforce and connect their brands, increasing awareness and brand equity.<br>  <br>  Using a house of brands strategy, one company let's each of its subsidiaries use their own brand name and invests in branding those names independently.  The downside here is that you are not leveraging all of your touch points to support a single brand name.  Companies that prefer this strategy are usually holding companies with varying lines of business.  <br>  <br>  Regardless of which branding strategy you choose, the key is to begin with a clear understanding of your customer base.  If you share customers, then branding consistency is essential.<br>  <br>  M.Fleischner<br>  <a href="http://www.seoelite-software-review.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.seoelite-software-review.blog...</a>|`|52cc7aea6be5f841604eaa406ced87e2aa	Because they can I guess.

c0b3df9e6b5632ff0bda2a96cf938465aa	I live in Germany and do work from home as a self-employed person, and I think it can be done anywhere in the world. I had some hard times in the beginning, as teleworking is a concept many employers don't understand, but once you have two or three of them, it's word of mouth and the quality of your work that makes you known. Just try it, and don't give up too early.|`|gIXucjoaaa	I don't own a business, but I know people who do.  I think they would hire as long as the person was at work when they were.

Pretend like it is a car payment you have to pay each Month. Make it where it is tough to access it. Also have a goal in mind|`|AA10200409	You pay your bills at a certain time each month. Well, pay yourself then too. While you deposit your money, open a savings account and direct a certain amount to your savings each month. Then forget it is there. It is off limits to you when you purchase anything.<br>  <br>  Everyone should pay themselves each month. After all, you're worth it!<br>  <br>  Happy savings.|`|F7iO45nMaa	The piggy bank answer is not lame! :) I would also suggest you get a large "piggy" bank and throw your loose change in there daily. It adds up very quickly and comes in handy in a pinch.<br>  <br>  Also, if you can afford it I would try to take 100 dollars out of each check and put it in savings before you get a chance to spend it. Just let it add up over the months and you should have a nice nest egg.<br>  <br>  If you're considering 401k, I would probably wait a little while and see what the market does...

Let the sales associate know you misplaced your card, and hopefully you can accomplish two things:  they will pull your account via your drivers license and allow you to make your purchases, and they will send a replacement card in the mail for future uses.|`|c19327ea28fe53a8f987cb20f7481f10aa	It depends on the store, but some will let you bring your bill in, which has the account number on it and pay that way.  Ensure that you have two forms of ID to properly confirm that you are the person in questions.  <br>  I used to work at Target, their Credit Card Bills has a bar code on the top that you scan to pay the bill instead of having the actual card!<br>  <br>  Good Luck to you.
tmh42R6Caa	First off, I would get a job at quickly as possible before you start showing.  Even though employers can't discriminate against you for being pregnant, they will.  Also, try to get a job with a company that offers educational assistance.  Then they may pay for your education.  As for what program - that depends on what you're interested in.  I just took a Certificate of Human Resource Management program that I finished in about 2 months (while pregnant).  I took it through Villanova University online and it was about $1900.  Good luck!

WcIIpxs2aa	If you are talking about an unpaid credit card debt, the answer is generally no for small balances (maybe $2000 or less, all depends on the company).  What will happen is they will charge-off the account, you will be harassed by collections, and you will have a nasty credit record for the next 7 years.<br>  <br>  True, for larger amounts, they will place a judgment against you that may need to be satisfied if you buy or refinance a house.  As a mortgage underwriter, I rarely saw garnishments for small credit card collections.  Child support or tax liens were much more frequent.<br>  <br>  Also, "assets" is rather vague.  If you have liquid assets, maybe talk with them about a settlement, which will also put a nasty mark on your credit, but you won't be referred to collections.|`|zLoyo24Taa	No, but they should be able to. People charge all kinds of things, then they get to keep them??? Thats not fair to the people who pay their bills|`|XsZsk55Jaa	In the US they need to first get a court judgment against you which is almost automatic if they ask for it.  Once they get a judgment just about anything you own, your bank accounts, and your salary, are fair game (depending on state laws).  <br>  <br>  Although they can get a judgment  they usually don't bother because most people in debt don't have anything worth going after or don't owe enough to make it worthwhile.  Between court costs and the sheriffs fee to seize assets, and auction fees, unless there is big time money involved it costs them more than they could recover.  So they just harass you for a while, turn it over to a collection agency who will harass you for a while longer, eventually they make you an offer to settle for less than you owe and in the end just write it off as a bad debt.|`|qjsXrMfHaa	If you are current, your creditors do not have the need to garnish your wages because they are receiving money from you on a monthly basis. But the minute you become delinquent your creditors have the right to take legal actions against you, garnish your wages since the banks do have a right to proceed legally to recover their money. When you stop making monthly payments, your creditors or collectors make it seem like they could garnish your wages from one day to the other, but in reality, it requires a lengthily legal process.|`|G3hTM9qeaa	No. This is why it is called UNSECURED debt. 99% of the time it will go to collections and the credit company will write it off as a business loss. It most likely won't even end up in court, no guarantees though. Now if you don't pay on something like a car loan, they will take back the car. That is a SECURED debt.|`|93LSvxduaa	No they won't. But they can send it collections, then possibly court or mark as a discharge on your credit report and still hold you responible for the debt.|`|c7UC1Fgeaa	If your in the UK the answer is no.
596a75e7c6a4325fea04d813bcf8fee2aa	The $0.99 on the can is just a "suggested" retail price. They can sell it at whatever price they want, but I wouldn't pay twice the MSRP for anything.
Znuzwi0Uaa	There is no easy way because each manager is different and it depends on which manager you interview with.  I interviewed with the store manager first, pet care second and that was just to make sure she agreed with him.  Some advice I can give you:<br>  <br>  Give them a chance to call you, wait at LEAST a week before you call.  <br>  Are you willing to do another job for a little while?  Pet care is the hardest department to get into, so you may end up cashiering for a while.  <br>  What is your work ethic like?  Meaning the only time I called off (before baby) was when I had a upper respiratory infection for 3 days and looked like I'd crawled out of a 2 week grave, moral is- will you call off for any reason/whim or will it take an act of god to keep you away when your scheduled.  <br>  And of course experience, do you have any with small animals?  Exotics?  Birds?  Fish?  If not, that's no big deal but you have to be willing to learn.  <br>  <br>  Those are some things to think about.  If in 2 weeks you haven't heard go ahead and call or stop by.  But NOT on a friday night or on the weekend.  That's the busy time and they have other things to do.  Good luck|`|6Fqbxghwaa	why call the manager...it might show that you're impatient..i would advise waiting..it took me up to 2-4 weeks to get a response...usually it takes a while because with this economy..the human resources department which handles employment..is also probably the manager who is busy as hell...or lazy...<br>  <br>  just show your passion for pets<br>  This is absolutely free!

Tagger|`|jAHFGi1raa	Well, I suggest you start from something you would really enjoy to do. For example, you may be good at piano, or art painting, or gardening or cooking. Write down a list of things you are good at and enjoy to do. <br>  <br>  Secondly, who are you targeting customers? Adult or children, women vs. men, business vs personal...<br>  <br>  Thirdly, refine your ideas to feed a need.<br>  <br>  I suggest you read some books about opening small business. Home based internet business are one of the best options. It does not require much capital and easy to start. More importantly, you can leverage internet to market your products or services with very little investment and effort. <br>  <br>  Do a google search on small business idea and marketing small business, you should find sufficient helpful information. <br>  <br>  Good luck!

cf87d1de83ee3dadaa4bb72472ee8d00aa	My father is your age, and I see him struggling too, but suicide should not be an option. When things are at its worst, it can only get better from there right? You will not feel like this forever, it will eventually have to get better, maybe not today, maybe not next year, but it will.  it is not worth ending your life over.  Try looking on craigslist.org for a job, depending on where you live, you might find quite a few job openings, or side jobs, people that need help.

Do you paint or do crafts of any kind?  If you're good at anything like that, there is always a market for such things.  Do you like animals?  Perhaps you could start a pet minding business.  You could even start an internet business.  Put your thinking cap on.  I'm sure there would be something you could earn money at that you just haven't thought of yet.|`|npbte7YTaa	How about a totally fresh start?  You could look on this as an opportunity to start over.  Is retraining for a new career an option?<br>  <br>  Taking your focus off your work situation a little and concentrating on other aspects of your life might help.  Are there any hobbies you always wished you had the time to try?  There are a lot of things you could have a go at without spending much money.  Some ideas could include gardening (growing your own vegies could be helpful right now!), learning a new language, reading all those classic novels  - or crime, or romance, or whatever - that you never had time to read when you were working. You could redecorate your house - a can of paint is an inexpensive way to freshen up a room.  Have you got 43 years of clutter?  Maybe you could start with a good clean out, one room at a time.  Try selling anything you want to get rid of on Ebay to earn a bit of extra cash.<br>  <br>  Maybe you could make yourself you new project for a while?  Sounds like you could use a little pampering (I am assuming from your username your are female) - bubble baths are very cheap! Look up home remedies for bath and beauty products on the web and treat yourself to a home-made day spa!  Hows the diet and exercise? Walking is free, and is really good for lifting the spirits - not only are you out in the fresh air, etc, but exercise produces endorphins that literally make you feel better.<br>  <br>  Also, do you have family or friends you can talk to about your situation?

tmh42R6Caa	Try to eat lunch with them whenever possible.  Also, try to relate to them.  If someone tells a story about going to see a movie last weekend, tell them what movie you just watched recently.  If there is a big age gap then they'll naturally not gravitate toward you, so you need to show what you all have in common.  And if nothing else works, try bringing in doughnuts one morning.  Or I just took a cake decorating class.  I brought in my test cupcakes on my 4th day.  May have seemed awkward, but what was I going to do with 2 dozen cupcakes?  It got everyone in my office and they asked about my class.  It worked well!|`|Sv4E2o6uaa	eat with them talk with them. when there talking jump in. maybe they dont no u well enough .|`|077a6030c62dfbb76a04f95355a9e296aa	I have learned that being friendly, in some environments, is a huge turn off.<br>  <br>  Unless it's vicious or hateful in the way they conduct themselves, just mirror their actions, and usually you get more notice.<br>  <br>  It seems that people can't stand people that are "always happy" or "always friendly", and you WILL get the cold shoulder.

The person you talked to apparently thought you wanted to change something on a return you had already filed.|`|2N6oTOLQaa	If you never filed your 2007  taxes at all, then you need to use either the 1040, 1040A or 1040-EZ form, (whichever one is appropriate for your situation). The forms change slightly each year so make sure you have the 2007 form for the version that you use. <br>  <br>  Form 1040-X is for amending your return if you already sent in a tax return for the year, but you need to make a change to it. <br>  <br>  All the forms you need (2007 versions) can be found in PDF format pretty quickly on the IRS website with a simple google search. Just download and print. <br>  <br>  If you have the 2008 version of any major tax software, you can use it to fill out your 2007 return. <br>  <br>  Note that you cannot efile for previous years, so whether you use software or fill the forms in yourself, you will have to mail paper copies of the forms to the IRS.|`|AA10469473	If you already filed and need to change something, use the 1040X.

For example: I drink bottled water. Now at $1 a bottle on something that covers over 65% of our planet is not smart. So I bought one of those water filters that screw into your faucet. I have bottles that I refil over and over again. I take them to work. Do you have a lot of small appliances around that house that are always on? I cut my electronic bill almost in half by unplugging all the clock radios and night lights. I also bought some of those florescent bulbs that look a lot like a regular bulb. These things use 80% less electricity than regular bulbs. Ave 60Watt incalescent bulb runs you 2 cents per hour. Ave 60Watt energy bulb averages 0.5 cents per hour. You would be surprised, but these small things add up. I know I was spending money on the water filter and energy efficient bulbs but these things will pay for themselves in a month providing they pertain to you. If you really need the money right away start cutting back on your food costs. Romain noodles cost a dime and they taste just as good as campbells chicken noodle that costs $130 a can. Ok no chicken in romain noodles, but you are probably just missing about 4 tiny pieces of chicken. Adjust your toilet to use lesser water. If you don't know how to do this then put a brick inside your toilet 'chamber'. You will use a little lesser water each time you flush..Before you know it you will be ahead. Wanna be creative? Find yourself leaving lights on? Buy a motion sensor switch, the lights will turn on when you enter the room and will turn off (by a set amount of time) when you leave the room. I have one, they cost $15 at HomeDepot. Need new windshield wipers for your car? Who says you have to buy 2? You only need the new one on the drivers side, leave the old wiper on the passenger side.  So remember you have to start thinking S-M-A-R-T! Yours truly seahorsehawrey.
fujnh1lcaa	All the previous answers are correct.. <br>  <br>  another way to obtain a statement quicker without any fees is if you have access to ONLINE Banking.. you can login to your account and print out the statement yourself.

My bank charges $3 for a replacement statement, so I print out my PDF copy whenever I need it. Statements are usually stored online for a year.
HeFlBmGSaa	I would call around and talk with a few loan officers that work for mortgage brokers. Tell them up front that you will work with them but you expect a great deal and you would like to see daily rate sheets from a few lenders so that you can keep yourself abreast of the rates. A few might be offended but the good loan officers are not at all afraid to show you a rate sheet. Most will be happy to assist you if they felt there was an opportunity to gain your business later on down the road.
fujnh1lcaa	Absolutely!! don't risk it.  Go to the bank right now or call them if you have access to telephone or online banking.. make sure you have the date, cheque number and amount of the cheque correct. Those are the information that the computer requre to do an absolute stop payment.  <br>  <br>  Pay the fee.  It'll be worth the price if someone did tried to cash it.. hopefully it's more .. but to protect yourself and your account.. you should do it. <br>  <br>  You are only human.

Don't feel bad about it at all. <br>  <br>  Take care ..|`|vsq9SW9Maa	You can't put the stop payment on it and no one else should be able to deposit or cash it because the name wouldn't match.  Should is the operative word.  They may find a stupid teller who doesn't notice the names don't match theirs or are possibly close enough to get that by.  If it's a small amount, weigh it against that vs. the stop-payment fee the check writer will have to pay.  If the writer decides to stop the payment, you should pay him/her back the $35 because you lost an endorsed check.  It would be the right thing to do.|`|AA11055746	Stop payment! And pay the person who wrote the check the $35 they are being charged to do so. It was your carelessness that caused the problem. Why should the person who wrote the check be out of pocket  because of you? If  payment isn't stopped and the check is cashed then they lose the money the check was made out for.

This one is my favorite: Make up a bunch of business cards and then go where your potential clients may gather. Strategically "drop" your cards in locations where they would be found and write something on the back of the card that is total nonsense, but would make total sense to someone looking for your services. I know its kind of "007" sort of stuff, but it works great!

What you could do is put this on your resume and choose the option for them not to contact your previous employer. When you go to your interview just say you left for personal reasons, you weren't fired so it wont go against you, if you decide to let this person contact your previous employer legally they cant bad mouth you, all they can say is they would ever rehire you or not.... but of course I don't think everyone follows that rule. Good luck in your interview, remember the best thing to do in an interview is walking in there like you already have the job, not being cocky but confident that your qualified for the job.

We jump to buy overpriced homes. We jump to get another 1% or so on our money, not even caring how it can be for real. We jump when analysts say to jump. And the government gets involved also with the jumping. The SEC never really looked into how a person(Madoff) could get increases in his investments year after year, when everyone else was losing money. A few people said the same thing, but anyone who did this was looked upon with disdain. They weren't cool, they were jealous, they were behind the times.<br>  Hence he got away with it, and had it not been for the housing collapse, he'd still be doing the same thing. The people that invested with him are to blame also, as they too asked no questions. They jumped blindly. <br>  It is just like the housing debacle, the individual who bought a home fully knowing he could never pay back his loan once the teaser rate ended, but did it anyway, as the banks signed these loans with a blind eye, are also to blame. We are all stupid, from the government who made rates so inexpensive, to wallstreet who was permitted to create home-backed securites, to analysts who voted thumbs up in unison, to the SEC who did not do their job, to the banking industry who screwed up putting all their eggs in one basket, while telling their clients and depositors to diversify, to the average person who never should have been in a home in the first place.
QdtppqFPaa	Talk to the lender first.  Do not miss payments until it is absolutely your last option.  Ultimately, the bank does not want to foreclose on your house because they will lose money.  Talk to them about your current situation. Banks will often allow you to defer your payments up to 6 months if your inability to pay is due to job loss, medical issues, and other situations which can be resolved within a short time period. Depending on your credit, current equity, etc., consider refinancing.|`|U3jZFawtaa	You lender may have a refi scenario that you can use. Forcing a loan modification has its drawbacks. Hopefully your attorney gave you the cons with the pros. It ruins your credit for a year or longer depending on the lender. You might fall through the cracks as one hand of the bank doesnt know what the other is doing and on the day your loan mod goes through you might have someone knocking on your door saying they just bought your house.<br>  <br>  See if they have an alternative and if not then you have to be persistent every single week to make sure they do what they say (they will be very swamped as time goes on this year and WILL get overwhemled at times) and don't rest till its "done done" not just "done." Good Luck|`|AA10006961	Yes of course.

OCVFrgeXaa	Having a Cash ISA at any time is a good idea.  In the short term, sure interest rates are low, but as and when they pick up, your interest is always going to be tax-free.  With interest rates in general being so low, having tax-free savings is one way of getting as much interest as possible.<br>  <br>  There are limits to how much you can contribute to a Cash ISA - ï¿¡3,600 in the current tax year - if you don't use it, the allowance is lost forever.<br>  <br>  The ISA contribution limits apply per tax year i.e. 6 April 08 to 5 April 09.  So the latest date on which you can put money into your 08/09 ISA is 5 April 2009.<br>  <br>  Regards.|`|AA11908567	The one I'm with is a maximum of ï¿¡3600 before April 5th.<br>  <br>  I know I ain't getting much this year as compared to last year, but it's better than nothing.|`|AA11141136	Short term; not much point. If you are planning to take up your allowance in ISA's for each year (ï¿¡3,600) over the longer term, then it probably is worth it, as rates will recover. Maybe you would prefer a Stocks&Shares ISA(up to ï¿¡7,200 per tax year). Some risk involved, but that is the way to go, to stand a chance of a decent return, over the long term.|`|XBwplUulaa	Interest rates will rise again at some point in the future.  A Cash ISA will still allow you to get the interest without tax deducted.  Most Cash ISAs offer a better rate of interest than other instant access accounts.<br>  <br>  So, I suppose it isn't a waste of time!|`|8YVo2Wogaa	You will hear different views but I think it is worth having as much tax-free savings as you can. I don't think the government would ever take away their tax-free status.<br>  <br>  All rates are pretty low right now though there are some fixed term which are not too bad.<br>  <br>  You can put ï¿¡3600 into a cash ISA before 5 April then another ï¿¡3600 after that date.

That would tell the interviewer that your central interest is not the job, but the pay and benefits.  A lot of your questions should be answered by you if you researched the company before the interview.  Questions should be geared toward expanding business and/or job growth.  You could show an interest in their convention business - how many do they host a year and the sizes of the conventions.  Do they have a training program for management positions (I'm sure they do).

3267581d4fe0c877a2fee89c9c9a0c43aa	The best way to answer it is honestly.  Saying you have no weaknesses is cocky, it's probably also untrue.  Everyone has some weakness, it's part and parcel of human nature, but what the interviewer considers a weakness, is probably not what you'd be looking at, and you stumbling through the question probably told them what they needed to know.  Personally, I always have something prepared for that question, even if I have to mask a strength as a weakness.  For example, I tend to be a bit perfectionist in doing my job, you might say that at times I may spend too much time getting things just right before a presentation, not so much that I blow the assignment, but enough that I might not get something else done that will now have to wait until after the presentation, thus I end up having a pile build on my desk if I have a major assignment that I want done "just so", but the pile will move once that's done with.  The trick is to appear human, acknowledge it, inform the interviewer that you are aware of this as a potential weakness, and that you do have means to deal with it as the tendency arises.|`|d2ae6085cefba5ad885e5915f9b8ccc7aa	Openly admit your weaknesses and suggest that you have done something to correct the weakness.  For example, "I have had a fear of public speaking for years but have spent numerous hours, in the last year, at local clubs giving presentations on subjects I really enjoy such as "whatever".  I have gotten much better and feel that continuing in this area will really be a benefit, I used to get really nervous..."<br>  <br>  Or play the opposite end and say something like "My standards are extremely high and sometimes I get discouraged when I am unable to influence others to work at the same pace."|`|o65scilmaa	Say a weakness that is not too bad such as "Working too hard on something and never give up", then say how you can improve it.<br>  <br>  The hardness question is what is the skill that you are weak at? That one I just said drawing... lol|`|hhI8LBNkaa	Be frank and speak about your weakness, its better than remaining quiet.But if you speak , you must speak about how you can overcome it or how are you trying to overcome.Interact freely with your interviewer.Dont be nervous!|`|c5XMnaNHaa	i believe i don't really have a weakness but if i had to improve one of my strengths, i would say _________ needs a bit more attention and i would like to increase my ability to perform better in that area.   <br>  <br>  <br>  good luck on ur job :)|`|FlmstAZyaa	depending on what your job is you can say" Well I have Asama that slows me down."

You should always try to answer this by admitting to a flaw you know you have, but then mention how you are aware of it and maybe your plan for improvement or change and how you are working on it. All without being too long winded, if possible. That tends to be the best way to handle this kind of question.|`|fm39D2Omaa	I had the same thing happen to me once.

The main things that make me suspicious are; the lack of information regarding what you have to do to earn the money, the option of payment by any method, a lack of company contact information and the simple fact that although this website claims to be an easy money maker it is hosted on a free service.<br>  <br>  I would avoid this website.

5rYChsWFaa	I do a lot of charity fundraisers for the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society that are really popular.  It all depends on how much time you have for the promotions.<br>  <br>  One of the best ways to get people there and to make money is to have a big raffle.  You can sell tickets ahead of time or at the event.  Go to every local business and get them to donate products, gift certificates or money to the event.  Let them know that they will be listed as a sponsor and will get a lot of very cheap advertising and good will by providing this to you.<br>  <br>  Create fliers, create a FaceBook event and invite everyone (tell them to invite people and it could be viral), find local event web sites, and make a post on Craig's List.  Also, contact the local news and let them know that you're throwing a charity event and that you would like to see if they could cover the event and let people know about it.  See if they can give you some free advertising before the event.<br>  <br>  Also, for the event talk to restaurants to see if they can cater the event.  Again, you're trying to get extras to draw people to your event and it's a great way for a caterer or a restaurant to get good advertising.  National chains are usually really good for this.<br>  <br>  One excellent fundraiser we did that raised a lot of money was raffling of a flat screen t.v.  We had 500 tickets that we sold for $20 a piece for someone to win a 46" flat screen t.v., which cost about $1,000.  You need a lot of people helping you sell it but they will sell very well beforehand and at the event.  You don't need to buy the t.v. until after you sell the tickets.  Let people know at the event you will have it shipped directly to them via Amazon.com.  Your upfront cost is only for the raffle tickets printing and I'm sure you could talk a local printer into doing that for free.  If you end up not selling enough tickets to pay for it, give people their $20 back.  You may even get an electronics store to donate a t.v. or give you one at cost.<br>  <br>  There's a lot you can do.  I hope this helps!<br>  <br>  Jared
9FxR4khCaa	The doctor that your doctor wants to refer you to for surgery is not a contracted doctor with your HMO, so will not be covered by your insurance. If you had a PPO, you would have more doctors to choose from, since the care is not managed by a Primary Care Doctor (as it is with an HMO). You simply choose a contracted doctor. However, you would have higher out of pocket expenses with a PPO since you will probably have a deductible and co-insurance (80/20) to pay.

Rather than looking for an agent that way, you should ask your friends, relatives and co-workers for referrals and then make appointments with the people they recommend and ask for these statistics directly from the agent.  If you do not get any recommendations from these people, call some of the local real estate companies and tell they you are looking for an agent to sell your home.  You should never make a decision based on the first meeting.  Prepare your questions beforehand, write down the answers as you talk to the person, then do the same thing at another company.

They spend years studying and they do not have the physical fitness needed to be farmers. Farming in India is very very hard work.

RhEhzGbraa	This is not something for you to take personally or get a lawyer to draw the line.  Your insurance company is doing not only their job but also fulfilling their responsibility to all their policyholders.  Your policy contains language that specifically states that they can request this information from you and that they can investigate your financial records.  Further it requires that you cooperate with that investigation.  From what you are stating I am quite sure they are not questioning that you staged the incident.  However, many people don't think it's wrong to turn in claims for items that they never even owned, that haven't been lost or damaged, etc.  Sometimes these people seem to be "good" people and have even had insurance with the same company for many years.  A part of them just feels "oh the insurance company has money and I've paid them well even more than I should have so this is okay"!  And in this economy you would not be believe what some "good" people are doing that basically amounts to insurance fraud.<br>  <br>  Your insurance company has a duty to investigate any claim until they feel satisfied that there has been no "padding" of the claim and that you are legitimately due that money.  Also I would not take the advice of "everyone" they are not you and are not in the situation nor are they insurance professionals and ditto for reading horror stories on the internet.  <br>  <br>  Listen to your mom in this situation she seems like she is very wise.  My only concern in everything you described is to ask why you turned in the claim involving the movers to your insurance carrier.  If you were my client, I would have advised you to file that claim against the movers who should have insurance.  Filing it with your insurance company means you will have to pay the deductible and have another claim on your record plus all that you have been going through because they can see your prior claims.  Your insurance company will turn around after they have paid this claim and subrogate against the movers insurance company to recoup their losses and your deductible but that could take months or up to a year.  If you have not yet been paid, consider filing the claim with the movers insurance.  Of course let your insurance company know that you are doing this and that if you are successful you will close the claim with them.  <br>  <br>  i hope this helps.  Good Luck!|`|02023201c466ca1751d4f14fb53cd526aa	You already have 2 great answers here.<br>  <br>  And, I will just add that it is normal after a claim to investigate your personal life.    There is a lot of fraud and insurance companies try to find it.    Just cooperate and everything will be fine. <br>  <br>  After 2 claims your lucky if your insurance company does not drop you.   <br>  <br>  **** Suggestion, take a higher deductible now and save on your premiums and do not put in any more claims for a few years unless its Major or something that you can not afford to pay.|`|4UBxVIYFaa	Given the current state of the economy, insurers are being deluged with more false claims than ever.  They are working diligently to weed out any such false claims.  What you are experiencing is part of those efforts.  They are simply satisfying themselves that your claim is valid, and is not related to other personal financial issues, which might have caused you to fabricate a claim.
vqdurAA5aa	For a simple stock split, you simply divide your total cost by the number of shares after the split.<br>  <br>  Examples:<br>  <br>  (1) You bought 100 shares for $3,000. That is $30 per share. The company split 2 for 1 so you now own 200 shares. Your cost basis is still $3,000, but now is $15 per share. ($3,000 / 200 = $15)<br>  <br>  (2) Your bought 100,000 shares for $1,000. That is $0.01 per share. There is a 1 for 100 reverse split, so you now own 1,000 shares. Your cost basis is still $1,000, but not is $1.00 per share. ($1,000 / 1,000 = $1.00)<br>  <br>  In the case of a spin off, you divide your cost basis between the two stocks according to their market value immediately after the spin off. <br>  <br>  Example: You bought 100 shares of XYZ for $3,000. XYZ spins off one division of the company as a new company, XZZ. You received one share of XZZ for every two shares of XYZ you owned. The first day XZZ trades after the split XYZ opens for $20 per share and XZZ opens for $10 per share. That makes the value of your 100 XYZ shares $2,000 and the value of your 50 XZZ shares $500. The totals $2,500. XYZ represents 80% of that amount and XZZ is 20% of that amount. That makes your cost basis for your XYZ shares 80% of $3,000, $2,400 or $24 per share. Your cost basis for your XZZ shares is 20% of $3,000, $600 or $12 per share.|`|AA12168152	first I would pull up a stock quote on the internet and then look for a URL that points to either "Historic Stock Prices" Or investor relations.

4f3GfrN6aa	You need to sign your bank card.<br>  <br>  If a bank card is presented to a customer service person at a store, and it is unsigned, it is not legal tender.  Therefore, legally it cannot be accepted for payment.  <br>  <br>  The signature is there because every so often, EFTPOS fails.  The line goes down, and everyone has to sign for their payment, even people with cheque or savings accounts.  The signatures are then checked against the back of the card.  If it doesn't match, the cash register operator can call the police.<br>  <br>  It is not legal tender without a signature.  You cannot withdraw funds over the counter at the bank with an unsigned card, unless there is a legitimate reason and you present photo ID.  A legitimate reason would be that you were unable to read or write.<br>  <br>  Eventually, you will encounter a person who will not take an unsigned card for payment, and will call for a supervisor.  You will be asked to present photo ID and then they will check your name on the card against the ID, and then request that you sign the back of it.  Refusal to do this means they will decline your purchase.<br>  <br>  I would just save myself the bother and sign the card.  Or put "Photo ID Only" on the back, and present your driver's licence with it.  That's about all you can do.<br>  <br>  If you don't sign your card, and it's stolen, ANYONE can sign the back of the card and present it as legal tender.  So put your own signature on it.<br>  <br>  I have declined hundreds of unsigned cards when I have worked as a register operator.  If I got caught allowing payment with an unsigned card, I would be reprimanded.|`|7NPkmH00aa	sign it. What's the worst that could happen?|`|8GjTRs42aa	it is a legal requirement to sign your card but lots of people don't bother, no one checks anyway. the bank will screw you over anyway, they rob people of money and get away with it every day (legally though)
t1hlab8Kaa	Whether we like it or not, the stock market is a big legal pyramid scheme which works as long as more money is coming into it than coming out of it.  If more money is coming out of it faster than going into it, then it starts to break down.  Unfortunately, it all eventually comes down to a few winning big money at the expense of many many many losing big money.  With regards to bankers and managers, their main interest mostly lies with making money for the banks and firms that they work for as well as themselves rather than for most of their clients since they always make money off of their client's portfolios no matter what the results are whether good or bad.  Despite the economic situation currently, the retirement of baby boomers in a few years from now has not yet been factored in and this will further strain things as many will be withdrawing money to use and trying to sell their businesses to a shrinking workforce taxed to pay for their pensions and medical care.|`|G8zAPz8Maa	Im afraid it was probably my fault as well, but I aint apologising

Its most likely in your contract. If the money isnt in your account at that time, its the same as a bounced check. And a bounced check is a felony.|`|LuMMvsLqaa	There are special rules governing payday loans.  The lender knows that you don't have the money when its issued, so they cannot legally prosecute you. They could years ago, but the courts got fed up with the scammy nature of these payday loan places.  An unpaid payday loan can ruin your checking account, however, and also your credit score. The loan place can also sue you in civil court and get a judgment against you and have your pay garnished.  If you need credit, you should consider a credit card that can allow you to make cash advances. Find good credit cards at this site for people with bad credit, like the Black Diamond Visa.  <a href="http://safecreditcardssite.com." rel="nofollow">http://safecreditcardssite.com.</a> Good luck and stop worrying. There is no debtor's prison in the U.S.|`|QdtppqFPaa	Anytime you borrow money and do not pay it back according to the terms in which you agreed, it is considered a felony.  Whether or not the company is going to pursue it is another story.  It would cost them much more than the $500 you borrowed to file criminal charges. PayDay loans are the worst.  They are very difficult to work with on a repayment plan and charge astronomical interest rates.  Stick to your guns.  Write a letter to the company with your detailed repayment plan.  Tell them you are offering to pay x amount of dollars every month for x months.  Detail the dates you are going to make the payments.  Reference the account number, date your letter, and sign ask for a written response from them agreeing to your terms. Then send it to the company via certified mail.  Keep copies for your records.  This will help you in the future to show that you have full intent to repay this debt.  If for some reason they try to pursue legal action, you will have documentation of intent to pay.  Furthermore, when this appears on your credit report, you have the ability to show your intent to pay as well.|`|Q23e5IQxaa	Dear ,<br>  <br>  I will suggest you  <br>  <a href="http://paydayloans.orgfree.com" rel="nofollow">http://paydayloans.orgfree.com</a><br>  <br>  Best of luck

A one point move on the /ES, which is the S&P future, is $50.  You can have a 4 point move within a minute easily.  The /NQ is the futures on the NASD.  A one point move there is $20 and can move just as quickly.  At expiration the active month rolls to the next month and it is best to out of any contracts before final settlement.  That is especially true if you do not want to deal with 5000 bushels of corn in your driveway.  (actually that is not likely but you get the idea)<br>  <br>  The amount you need to put up can vary depending on the broker.  It is not a market for beginners.  Mine requires $6k for an /ES contract.  If you are on the right side of a trade you can make $500 inside an hour.  To do that trading the underlying index you would need a lot more than 6k.  The leverage is the advantage.<br>  <br>  Options are an entirely different animal.  Not as leveraged but you are buying/selling time value as well as the possibly the underlying.<br>  <br>  Buying an option gives you the option but not the requirement to buy the underlying at a set price.  Buying a futures is agreeing to buy the underlying period.

If this is genuinely not possible don't miss more than 2 months payments or you will be classified as a Non-Paying customer. Then things go downhill from there.<br>  <br>  You will be reported to CIBIL, which means you wont get any loans or credit for 7 years. This means no home loan, no credit card, no car loan etc.<br>  <br>  Apart from this your account will be forwarded to collections. Those people will come to your office and home, to ask for money. You can negotiate with them for a settlement - that you will pay some lesser amount of money and close the account. Beware that if you take this option the bank will get off your back, but you will still be reported to CIBIL.<br>  <br>  Don't give any cheques that might bounce. Not paying is an offence, but bouncing a cheque is worse and there are specific laws for it.<br>  <br>  If you have a savings account with the same bank they might freeze it or deduct money from it without asking you.

It all depends on how much time you have for the promotions.  We have found the best way to raise money is to have an event.  Maybe you can have it at a local restaurant where you might get them to sponsor you as you will be bringing in a lot of business.  They will also sometimes give you part of the sales for the evening for the promotion.<br>  <br>  One of the best ways to get people there and to make money is to have a big raffle. You can sell tickets ahead of time or at the event. Go to every local business and get them to donate products, gift certificates or money to the event. Let them know that they will be listed as a sponsor and will get a lot of very cheap advertising and good will by providing this to you.<br>  <br>  Create fliers, create a FaceBook event and invite everyone (tell them to invite people and it could be viral), find local event web sites, and make a post on Craig's List. Also, contact the local news and let them know that you're throwing a charity event and that you would like to see if they could cover the event and let people know about it. See if they can give you some free advertising before the event.<br>  <br>  Also, for the event talk to restaurants to see if they can cater the event. Again, you're trying to get extras to draw people to your event and it's a great way for a caterer or a restaurant to get good advertising. National chains are usually really good for this.<br>  <br>  One excellent fundraiser we did that raised a lot of money was raffling of a flat screen t.v. We had 500 tickets that we sold for $20 a piece for someone to win a 46" flat screen t.v., which cost about $1,000. You need a lot of people helping you sell it but they will sell very well beforehand and at the event. You don't need to buy the t.v. until after you sell the tickets. Let people know at the event you will have it shipped directly to them via Amazon.com. Your upfront cost is only for the raffle tickets printing and I'm sure you could talk a local printer into doing that for free. If you end up not selling enough tickets to pay for it, give people their $20 back. You may even get an electronics store to donate a t.v. or give you one at cost.<br>  <br>  There's a lot you can do. I hope this helps!<br>  <br>  Jared
AA10259042	This fund does have a minimum regular monthly minimum of $500 if it is the 4 in 1 index fund.  Also has a minimum initial investment of $10,000. This is because the fees are so low.  Fidelity does have funds with a lower minimum regular investment. I believe their minimum for those is $100.  The Fidelity Freedom 2030 Fund which is a retirement fund has a very similar performance record to the 4 in 1 but meets the lesser investment requirements.  <br>  <br>  To meet your specific requirement of $50 per month regular investment you will need to consider T Rowe Price, which has that option. <br>  <br>  The T Rowe Price Total Market Index Fund has a very similar performance record to the Fidelity 4 in 1 and the $50 regular investment option.  In fact to begin there is only to sign up for the $50 regular investment--no other minimum investment.  their Capital Appreciation Fund actually has a better performance record. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://individual.troweprice.com/public/Retail/Mutual-Funds/Historical-Performance" rel="nofollow">http://individual.troweprice.com/public/...</a>

It's really not that expensive, and a smart idea anyway.  I suggest you have them take it out of your monthly payments.  Makes it easier to stay on top of it that way.  Also, don't forget about the property tax payments.  also something I personally think is best to include with my monthly mortgage payments.  Good luck!

NwkZ5OmCaa	Your post makes no sense.<br>  <br>  OID is original issue discount and refers to the calculation of income when you buy a capital asset.  The 1099-OID is sent to the taxpayer, they don't issue it to themselves.  (There is a scam where people try to convince the IRS that they got a 1099 statement with a huge amount of tax withheld on it, but the IRS is well aware that these are bogus and will prosecute when it sees one.)<br>   <br>  <br>  You can't "write off" the costs of other assets/debts by buying a security.  One has nothing to do with the other.<br>  <br>  Form 1099-OID Fraud<br>  Oct. 10, 2008<br>  <br>  The IRS cautions taxpayers to avoid getting caught up in a new tax fraud disguised as a debt payment option for credit cards or mortgage debt. The fraud is also marketed as a way to reduce taxes or pay outstanding tax liabilities. It involves the filing of Form 1099-OID, Original Issue Discount, and/or bogus financial instruments such as bonded promissory notes or sight drafts.<br>  <br>  This fraud has evolved from an earlier frivolous argument that a âstrawmanâ bank account has been created at the Treasury Department for each U.S. citizen, and that individuals could use such âstrawmanâ accounts to pay debts and claim withholding credits.<br>  <br>  The IRS addresses the âstrawmanâ argument in Revenue Ruling 2005â21 and Revenue Ruling 2004-31, and discredits the use of this position for income tax purposes. Moreover, the courts that have reviewed the âstrawmanâ argument and other similar arguments have found them frivolous.<br>  <br>  For more information on frivolous schemes, see The Truth About Frivolous Arguments.|`|zuGKIWfNaa	Are you talking about investments like zero-coupon bonds?<br>  <br>  If not, can you explain what you mean by "oid"?

fWP8aBpsaa	You can initially apply online,  You will need to fill in some forms and will then be invited to an interview at your local job centre.<br>  <br>  The interview will last around 1hr where a "job-seekers agreement" is drawn up. This describes what you agree that you will do to find a job (such as visiting the job centre x times a week, or writing to companies, etc) and the type of jobs that you will look for. <br>  <br>  After that you must attend the job centre every two weeks to sign on.   This consists of a short chat about what you have done to find a job.<br>  <br>  Review interviews are then held every six months.  At these your progress and whether your goals are still realistic will be discussed.  <br>  <br>  At a review meeting, you may be required to do additional things such as attend training courses, or visit the job centre to discuss your progress every week.<br>  <br>  FWIW, I found the "help" from the job centre with regard to finding a job detrimental to my attempts to find a job.  They seem to have a box of a "typical job seeker" that they try to fit everyone into.  I have my doubts as to whether anyone fits the "typical job seeker", I know I certainly didn't. <br>  <br>  How you get on will depend on the people you talk to.  I talked to a number, some were happy to turn a blind eyes to the rules given my unusual circumstances, others gave me hell.|`|WxWiP3QJaa	Go to the jobseekers website... and then phone the number given. They will give you a day for an initial interview and send you some forms. Fill them in, send them off or take them to the interview (whichever is required) and then take the documents they ask for... id, NI number (card not needed), etc. After about two weeks you will be asked to go back and "sign on" and you will be asked what you have done to look for work... tell them... and a couple of days later you get some money, really not very much. Do not feel guilty about it.. it is what you have been paying National Insurance for.|`|IEbAHp0gaa	You phone up the Job Seekers Allowance phone number and they ask you some general questions.<br>  <br>  You then have to go to the office and sign to let them know that you are searching for work, they want proof of this so you show them all the jobs that you have applied for and all that, that's all.<br>  <br>  Sometimes, after a few weeks/months they will interview and track your progress ask how things are going, but I don't think you'll be out of job for that long, good luck job hunting, all the best.|`|kGld130yaa	You have to telephone the helpline the have first. Don't go down there because you'll have a wasted journey. They will ask you lots of questions on the phone and then they will give you a time for an appointment to see somebody at the jobseekers centre.|`|qVIRRzY5aa	Sorry to hear. Same has happened to me twice in the past and right now it's not looking great either. Jobseekers is easy enough-you will need to call the Job centre on Monday to book an appointment. They will give you a date to come in, but will also back-date the money from when you finished work. From what I remember, I had to take a valid passport or driving licence. They just fill the forms in with you, then you just sign on from there. I think you sign on every fortnight, all that is, is to sign your name to declare you are actively seeking work and they know to keep paying your benefit into the bank. Oh and just write down on the form they give you, what jobs you have applied for. Bit silly really, coz you don't have to prove it. Although, people like me and you do wanna work, so why should we?! Hope this helps and good luck with the job hunting! Sounds corney, but honestly, things happen for a reason everytime-you'll come off all the better, although it won't seem like it right now.|`|Mwhi6w53aa	i was the same as you but your right you need money and your losing out on money your entitled too its not hard to get jobseekers allowance your entitled to it so do yourself a favour and monday morning phone new claims contact centre 08000556688 lines open 8am to 6 pm .<br>  <br>  The call takes half an hour its basically yes and no answers and they just ask details your last job you then have appointment at jobcentre takes half hour say just say what you will do to find a job no problem you sign on and your paid your benefit so please do it as i was losing out on money and its not on youve paid tax so get what you deserve.<br>  <br>  Also the social fund crisis loans number is 08001699891 phone this AFTER you phone new claims contact centre as they will want to know you have phoned to start a claim and if you are broke you can get a loan off them which they will take small bits out of your benefit every week  the phoneline open 830 am to 430pm can involve holding on the phone for upto half hour but its freephone persist same goes for the new claim you might hold a while.<br>  <br>  Anyway i think thats all you need to know also benefit enquiries number is 08456088665 phoneline open 9am to 5pm.
fSlZQzS4aa	The response above really has it confused.<br>  <br>  If there is a levy on your bank account or wages it can be released if you can demonstrate that it is causing a hardship as defined using IRS expense standards (They are developed by the US Dept of Labor.) <br>  <br>  An existing levy on your wages is not an installment agreement unless you roll over and let it be.  A levy takes all your take home pay over an amount that is exempt by law.  For a single person, this is as little as $179.81 per week or $779.18 per month. (Different filing statuses have different exemptions.)  For an installment agreement, the standard payment is the difference between your income and your allowable expenses or, if you owe less than $25,000, the amount that will pay the liability in full within five years. This will almost always be less than the amount that will be paid as the result of a levy on wages.<br>  <br>  Bankruptcy will stop a levy, at least temporarily.  Debtors who file bankruptcy petitions are entitled to a stay of collection action from all creditors including IRS and its state counterparts.  If a levy has been served it must be released.  After being discharged, you can be fair game again.  If you file a Chapter 13 petition in Bankruptcy Court, you will have to propose a payment plan for paying all your debts including taxes.<br>  <br>  You can ask for a "one time settlement" called an offer in compromise but must offer an amount that at least equals what IRS feels it will eventually be able to collect from you.  You can do the paperwork yourself but it is a minefield.  <br>  <br>  For practical purposes, in layman's terms there is no difference between a levy and a garnishment. Both take your money involuntarily because you didn't pay your bills.|`|AA12266415	In layman's terms-- on several of those questions or issues raised -- you should find a lawyer (for free, volunteer) to assist you.  My understanding is the following -- (but you can personally check the source @ IRS.com) -- just put your questions in ... and they will answer.  <br>  <br>  1)  If your pay has been garinshed by the IRS -- that is considered a payment agreement.  (so there is no need to make an arrangement-- your opportunity to negotiate or agree has passed).<br>  2)  If your home has been levyed -- that is an insurance policy that the IRS/govt. will get their payment, when the home is sold or taken back by the bank.<br>  3)  You can only negotiate for a one-time settlement or payment using a attorney -- normally (there are alot of court forms to be filed in this situation), and the IRS does negotiate with private citizens.<br>  4)  A levy is a tax lien against personal assets (property with a value) and a garnishment, is a legal understanding with an employer that the government is paid from your paycheck before you get paid.<br>  5)  Bankruptcy cannot stop a levy.  The levy will be usually honored by the judge to ensure that the government is paid, either by you, the seller or by the new owner of the property (but you can check w/an attorney on this one).<br>  <br>  In my personal opinion, if you do not know these laws or regulations, before you make a presentation of anykind; or definitely you should find a local attorney (to do this talk pro-bono (free) for you -- you need someone who deals in "bankruptcy or IRS liens to make sure your audience is told the truth.    Good luck, :)

AA10469473	Since the difference is an even $300, I'm going to guess that it has something to do with the recovery rebate credit - that you showed on the return that you were eligible for it, but weren't.

I own property all over and some do , some you have to suspend your services and others you have to cancel then sign up again. But if you don't find out you will get a bill like I did when I first learned to check. It also taught me to ask about suspending accounts. They may first say that you have to close it out but if you push them some will suspend it for you. Suspension is better because that way you dont get your credit run every year over it. If they cancel and you have to apply each year they may run your credit. Ask them about it if they don't have a suspension program.

Qqz0H2hEaa	It sounds like you have boxed yourself in and done away with your options.<br>  <br>  If you have closed on the purchase of the new building then you have either given the seller cash (by handing them cash or check or by getting a loan from a third party and that third party handing the seller cash or check) or you have signed a note with the seller obligating your church to pay the mortgage payments.<br>  <br>  Now you can allow the mortgage note holder to foreclose on your new church building or sell the new building to someone or sell the old building.<br>  <br>  If you are a connectional church your denomination may help you in some way.<br>  <br>  Now if you don't mean that you have actually purchased the new building but merely signed a contract agreeing to purchase- then you are in better shape.  You have to submit to whatever penalty the contract requires to get out of the agreement or at the very least find a way to get the seller of the new building to extend the "contingency" period.

That and rescinding Sarbanes-Oxley.  It should still be changed but the damage is done.<br>  <br>  A short ban would be ridiculous.  How about a long ban?  Same thing on the up tick rule.  How about a down tick rule?  A free market has to be free to move to reflect perceived value.  The only thing that is defensible is a daily limit, but that just delays, and pretty much insures, further move the next day.  There are some limits that are triggered upon large market moves.  that is enough.<br>  <br>  As a case in point, would Bank of America really be worth more than a buck if a short ban had kept it at 5, 10, or 20?  Not.

AA12266415	Yes, If you are on a payment plan, you should continue to make your payments.   If you get behind, you should make a phone call to the IRS, there is usually toll free # or send a letter referencing those tax years and your SS# and explain your previous situation to ensure they understand that you missed a payment and that your intention is to continue.  If you have not missed any payments, then continue to make the payments on those tax years.  They should be sending you statements twice a year, once in July and once in January, to let you know how much you have paid and where you stand in your repayment process.   When you do your taxes for 2008 and if you get a refund, they will take that refund and apply it to your 06 & 07 taxes owed, or you can stipulate that the refund go towards those years (at the bottom of your return, where you would sign).  If  you should be so lucky and you come into extra money, you can also send in extra payments to the IRS using your SS# & reference those tax years in the memo part of your check.
Pjm9pg7iaa	See if the websites display the logo of your credit card. If they do, contact your card company (Mastercard 800-947-1000 - i don't work for them) and tell them what you are going to do. If you don't warn them , they will suspect that your card has been stolen and being used in Germany. Then order the items..

I doubt the landlord actually made her sign the lease.<br>  <br>  She is legally obligated for the full term of the lease or to pay rent until a new tenant is found.<br>  <br>  Her only options are:<br>  <br>  1.  Appeal to the landlord and hope he's nice enough to let her off the hook. If he does, get everything in writing.<br>  <br>  2.  Pay whatever lease break fee is outlined in the lease.  If none...ask what it would cost to get out of the deal.<br>  <br>  3.  Prove that the unit is not habitable.  This would require an inspection from the housing department.
QITtHwQoaa	The regulation is for any glazed opening. If there are windows many insurance companies want the opening to meet the missile impact test. However some insurance companies in Florida require the garage door to meet Miami-Dade wind code even though the house isn't in that area & it doesn't matter if they have glass or not.<br>  <br>  So you may just have to protect the opening w/ a wind screen when the storm comes, you may be able to change the glass section to a solid section and keep the rest of the door, or you may have to change the whole door.<br>  <br>  Different insurance companies have different rquirements & the only way to know for sure is to ask them what they require before you spend money on something they won't accept.<br>  <br>  FYI - Some insurance companies will now require your garage door to meet certain codes before they will renew the policy.|`|02023201c466ca1751d4f14fb53cd526aa	Is this a construction question?
