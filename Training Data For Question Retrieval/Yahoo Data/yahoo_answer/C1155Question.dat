A pesar de la globalizacion y  de la rapidez en las comunicaciones, seguimos estando atrasados, por favor, lean la siguiente anécdota:    Oprah Winfrey en uno de sus programas mas recientes, entrevisto a Tommy Hilfiger, el dise?ador de la ropa que lleva su nombre. En el show, Oprah le pregunta si en verdad él habia hecho el siguiente comentario:    '...Si yo hubiera sabido que los ****** americanos , los latinos y mexicanos y los asiaticos comprarían mi ropa, no la hubiese dise?ado tan buena...'       '...Desearía que ese tipo gente no comprara mi ropa, pues esta hecha para gente caucásica, de clase alta... y desearía dársela mejor a los cerdos...'        Ante la pregunta de Oprah Winfrey de si el habia hecho tan cruda afirmacion, Hilfiger respondio con un simple y escueto 'SI'. Inmediatamente después, Oprah le exigio que abandonara su show.      Me llego en una carta cadena y quiero saber si es verdad para reenviarla

Don't know why it got reported, but my lips look uneven because of stitches that I had when I was very young but I didn't notice it until just a couple of years ago. I've been trying to find the right color that doesn't clash with my skin tone, I am mixed with white, native american, african and south american, so I have a confusing skin color. It's like a light golden complexion.I have tried so many lipstick colors from reds, maroons, and now browns which still look kind of pink or red because my lips are like a light pink. should I just go with darker browns now? Also, I'm not sure which colors would clash with my black hair and black eyes. Any lipstick tips for me? or any other makeup tips would be appreciated also.

20090308040936AAweqni	Beauty & Style;Fashion & Accessories	Stiletto Heel Damage -  The Unusual Damage!?	What unusual damage have women wearing stiletto heels caused? It would be interesting to know because any questions or articles regarding the question seem to refer mainly to the same damage a) Wooden Floors b) Lawns c) grid covers or getting heels trapped in cracks in the pavement !      I ask the question in all seriousness because the answers invariably are always the same as listed above      As an illustration, I work for a transport company and we had a claim for damage to a heel caused by the heel going through the vehicle floor! The Vehicle was reasonable new and it hadnt happened before or since and the floor wasnt even rusted, yet there were these bullet like holes that went completely through the floor! and the woman had the damaged shoes to prove it! We often suspected that it was a set up job because the woman concerned was normal size (Must have had heavy bones) LOL!      Another instance was a young lad who lived nearby who brought me his model train because "It wont run now" I wasnt surprised when I discovered the body was cracked and had a hole in it and the driving axles bent all shapes! Seems the lads sister had trodden on it and only later confessed!      With millions of women wearing stilleto heels world wide it just seems odd that the same three or four damages caused are always reported.        So I thought I would ask the experts the girls and women for any unusual damage they had caused with their heels?      Who knows, maybe we could end up with a world record breaking list of experiences! Sadly no prizes given for the best experiences but please no inventions, I hope to get away from the standard lawns and hardwood floors!      No! My address isnt available, I dont want my lawn wrecked or my collection of model vehicles speared thank you, But thank you to all who would kindly pass their experiences on      My apologies if its in the wrong category, I didnt know which one it fitted! :O)

20060811073407AAq1gno	Beauty & Style;Hair	Should I perm now?	I have thick, healthy, dark brown hair 4-5" long and is still just a little naturally wavy near the top/back.  I've blown dry/sprayed nearly everyday for 25 years. I love advantages of a perm like not having to dry after a shower or waking up late and using a pick & wind can't mess it up. I LOVE the idea,my wife hates it. Thinks that I don't like myself and perms are harsh on hair. I'm VERY busy & this is the look I REALLYdesire.      A few weeks ago I got a tight set done anyway and LOVED IT! The stylist said I should try a bigger perm rod the next time before deciding on which size to perm with. The curls were so tight and bouncy, not a fro! just very sexy looking all over! I felt really good about it as I pumped gas near the busy road, paid the cashier,went to McD's, drove thru town back home to show off my new do   Have read pros/cons about overprocessing, & some horror stories about being fried.Just don't now what to do now. I don't know how family/friends would react. Any tips?

20090307141830AAu8pkQ	Beauty & Style;Hair	Would it be rude to ask my hairstylist if I can style my hair myself?	It's taken me many years, but I've finally found a stylist who can cut my hair. I have very curly hair and it's been difficult finding someone who can cut it right, so I'm very happy I've found her. The problem is, she styles it all wrong after the cut and I always end up having to go home and re-do it. I like to put gel in my hair when it is wet, scrunch it, and then air dry it. She insists on trying to diffuse my hair or straighten my hair or blow-dry it first and then put gel in it. I've tried telling her to just let it go, that I don't have time, and I've even told her what I normally do to my hair. She just does not get it. She gives me a funny look and then breaks out the diffuser! Diffusers do not work with my hair. I don't know why, but they just don't. I've told her this. I always end up leaving the salon looking like a frizzy mess or a drowned rat. The cut is great! It's just the styling. What should I do? Would it be rude to ask her to let me style it myself?

20090227131743AAURCMz	Beauty & Style;Fashion & Accessories	Is it okay for 12 year olds to dress 'trendy'?	Hello, I have a little sister who is very stylish. She doesn't like things that are there for her age group, she loves Forever 21, Urban Outfitters and vintage stores. No, she is not one of those teenage sluts. She would never be caught dead in hoop earrings, Abercrombie, fake nails and makeup (for now about the makeup). But I am a little concerned. Is this truly okay?      No, she does not wear thongs, heels and makeup (she does not even have the time to do makeup). She loves Converse shoes, tights of any color and scarves.

I am currently taking laser hair removal sessions and I use a numbing cream Esracain Cream 5%.   Very hard for me to bare the pain even with the numbing cream. Sometime the pain is horrific and they bring the laser setting down a bit for me.  Even after they bring the setting  down I bare with the pain.  I got a call today from the laser place telling me  that they will need to bring the laser power up ( Horrific Pain Level) in order for me to get results or my contract would be void with them. Would Vicodin / Lortab 500MG do the trick along with the numbing cream?> Is it recommended? Is it safe? Would I feel pain?

He never does anything in front of my friends, but when I'm alone he always has to say something to me. And once he even said he loves me! but like in a joking way but I only knew him for like a month or so. Though one time my friend asked him if he liked me and he said no. But I was right there when he said it.    So does he like me?

20090308015135AATNnXO	Beauty & Style;Skin & Body;Other - Skin & Body	Some Questions About Navel/Belly Piercings?	I'm female, 19 turning 20, and I've been planning on getting a traditional navel/belly piercing for two years now, and I've done a lot of research on the procedure, aftercare, risks, etc. but still have not been able to find answers to the following questions:      1) How does weight gain and loss affect a healing and a non healing belly piercing? (Not a huge weight fluctuation, just a small amount, i.e. when you get bloated around your period).      2) Which type of ring is better for a healing navel piercing: A bar or a ball closure ring (or if there are other better types, what are they?) (I ask because my Auntie who got her belly pierced 3 years ago had a ball closure ring and it healed perfectly, whereas 4 of her friends also had theirs done, but had a bar put in, and in all cases, theirs either migrated or rejected).      3) Would a flexible bar/ring made of P.T.F.E the stuff they make pregnancy belly bars out of) be a good idea for a healing piercing?      I'd appreciate any advice and/or personal experiences relating to my questions... thanks in advance :)
