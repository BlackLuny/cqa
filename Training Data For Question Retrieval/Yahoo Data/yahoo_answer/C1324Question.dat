Then there was a giant noise, more powerful then all of the screaming people on this asteroid, and a gigantic blue cloud appeared over us, and a shadowy image appeared within the cloud, and then it spoke, instantly silencing every one. The voice said this "You my children have failed me, Failed The mighty universe i had bestowed upon you, Now I have reset time and the universe, and you will be within the creation that will give it life. Now Learn from your mistakes and do beter then was done before, for i do not wish to grant the human race a third try" After that the cloud and figure dissappeared and the asteroid exploded into another asteroid, and the universe began anew.

20090202225723AAwMkka	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	My Dead Dad in my dreams?	My dad died this year after being electrocuted at work. When he was at the hospital, they told us he was paralyzed, along with many other problems. My dad was very very active, and he had a broken hip that never healed properly...but he never got it checked because he was scared of losing his leg.      Anyway, in the hospital he kept moving his arms frantically, probably from the shock, and he kept touching his legs, but obviously he couldnt move them. Im not sure, but I feel like he almost let himself die when he felt that he was paralyzed.      3 days after his death, I had a dream that he came over and was upset. He was yelling at us that we were planning a funeral since he was not dead. Then he lifted up his pants and showed us his fake legs. He was so mad about his legs, that he stormed out of the house.      What did my dream mean?? Do you think he hadn't yet accepted his death??
20090202225955AAXEO5Y	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Is there more help for women because they are more likely to ask for it, or do women ask for more help because?	.. there is more help for them (or they are more encouraged to seek it)?  - I believe the latter to be more true.      I ask because many women criticize men for not asking for help and point to the fact that women as a whole are more likely to ask for help 'when they need it' than men. - Well,      Say a girl and boy were born today. By the time she is 20 she would've presumably asked for or gotten more help than the 20 year old man. Now was she born with the comfort and confidence in asking for additional help (than she saw the boy get), and did she come up with this idea by herself? Or was she shown that it was more acceptable for her to ask for more help/accommodation than the boy got?

I analyze nearly every detail of everything anyone says to me and their body language, especially since I started watching the show "Lie to Me".

One section was a sentence completion test, are these good answers, why or why not from a psychological, law enforcement, perspective.      My father_______. ( I put: is a successful person.)

The African American driver exits his car and is yelling at you, claiming you stopped him only because he is black. How do you respond?      I put... I would use the appropriate amount of verbal/ physical force to control the person so that I could continue with my investigation.      2. Your partner tells back at the African American man, saying "Why dont you people ever shut the hell up", and tells the man to "shut the F__k up and get your black a_s on the curb". What do you do?      I put... I would take control of the situation to avoid any further confict. I would later notify our supervisor of my partner's behavior.      Please let me know how my answers are. Thanks.

20090203000547AAgubxQ	Social Science;Psychology	Panic attacks and gender?	I noticed not long ago that in my circle of friends and acquaintances, a large number of women mentioned that they'd had "panic attacks" in the past.  This is a pretty broad term of course, but generally they used it to refer to a sudden bout of absolute terror, disorientation, paranoia, and in some cases borderline dementia (hallucinating, etc) that also had them crying, hyperventilating, shaking, etc.      I decided to ask my male friends about this and not a single one ever thought they'd had a panic attack, or anything like it.      Obviously this wasn't very scientific, and it's more just my own curiosity.  I'm not asking this to imply that women have a psychological inferiority or anything, so please don't take it as that.  I'm just curious as to whether or not anyone else has noticed this or there's any data out there on it.      Thanks!

Keeping away from the pinch of the idea of  not to think of  having sex is almost impossible and brain cannot accept to compromise on satisfaction. In fact, it requres sex with deep passion oral  as well and of every type in depth. Though many a times body is not in a position to afford prolonged sex and even during the course of sexual involvement with wife though only some times, yet it occurs that it takes only a minute to end the show. Even if the show runs the satisfaction as desired by mind is far from the sight. What to do.
20090203000504AANt4ly	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	The meaning of my dream?	Ok, here's the thing: I don't usually believe dreams have meanings beyond the subconscience telling us what we have been thinking about, but I had one dream a few weeks ago that has me a little worried.      I dreamed that a few people, I think close friends, and I were sitting around a table shelling some walnuts. I was showing off a bit, because theirs kept breaking while I could get the nuts out whole, because my grandfather had had a walnut tree and I had done it when I was little. Anyway, I opened one up, and found a ginormous black spider sitting there.   I closed the shell and ran out onto the street with the walnut. Then I threw it onto the ground, where it smashed open, and I saw the spider on the ground. It was huge alright, and it had a red hourglass pattern on its back. A black widow.   And then suddenly it was on me.      I woke up from that nightmare shivering cold and sweating. It took me hours to get back to sleep.      I've only had that dream twice, but since then I've had an irrational fear of walnuts. Like, I see spiders all the time and they don't bother me a bit, but I saw walnuts in the supermarket and suddenly I was so scared, I could actually feel my heart racing. What do I do? Does it actually have a meaning? And why did I even have that dream in the first place? I mean, before that I hadn't even thought about walnuts for years, and then suddenly they're scary as heck. ??? Can anyone help?      Please, supportive answers only, not "you're just plain nuts" theories.

20070630103313AAarZ4i	Social Science;Psychology	Do you think inferiority complex is good?	maybe it is good because we do not interrupt people. we just be in our own world and enjoy it. sometimes it is a beautiful world.      inferiority complex:   An inferiority complex, in the fields of psychology and psychoanalysis, is a feeling that one is inferior to others in some way. Such feelings can arise from an imagined or actual inferiority in the afflicted person. It is often subconscious, and is thought to drive afflicted individuals to overcompensate, resulting either in spectacular achievement or extreme antisocial behavior, or both. Unlike a normal feeling of inferiority, which can act as an incentive for achievement, an inferiority complex is an advanced state of discouragement, often resulting in a retreat from difficulties.      source:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inferiority... 
20070705122905AAcVklv	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	If the dictonary definition of "feminism" is accepted by feminists...?	Shouldn't the same dictionary definition of "child" be accepted as well?    MW online, first entry under "feminism" states: the theory of the political, economic, and social equality of the sexes.   The same first definition under "child" states: an unborn or recently born person.      It would seem that either both are correct or both incorrect, not one or the other depending on one's prejudice.    Also, dictionary.com lists #4 entry for "child" as "a human fetus" with a similar definition of feminism as outlined above.   Thoughts?

20090203013856AATRAXE	Social Science;Sociology	Have you noticed a change in sociological attitudes about the very wealthy? ?	In the textbook, "Social Problems", it seems like it parallels some attitudes of what the film "Zeitgeist" is saying about the 'owners of this country' and corporate greed. The book mentions things like golden parachutes for defunct C.E.O.'s. I asked my professor about this and they said that basically, it is a point he was trying to make about the economic stratification of society- the keeping down of the poor by the rich.      I... don't know what to make of this. Things like 'Human Resources' for companies, as if using real humans for batteries, actually seems very bizarre and something out of 'The Matrix'.       Is this really the case? Because it feels like people are paranoid about what they don't know, and since most people are not multi-billionaires, it might be easy to have a scapegoat or hold malice towards these 'puppeteers'.       I'm just wondering if this attitude against the very wealthy is just coming into play, and a new attitude is emerging, or if this is essentially the same old attitude we've been seeing for centuries upon centuries, as in the case of Ebenezer Scrooge and Tiny Tim.

Repeal the Ladies' vote. It is suffering and not suffrage that keeps us up on our pedestals. And if God hadn't wanted us up on pedestals, He wouldn't have make us shorter than our husbands.        2. Abolish the environment. It takes up too much space, and is almost impossible to keep clean.        3.  Free Ladies from wage slavery. The 60-odd cents we earn for every manly dollar is entirely too much. It is unladylike to accept money for work.        4.  Maintain illiteracy as a high school graduation requirement. An uninformed populace is an obedient populace, and a self-censoring one, too. After all, ignorance is a virtue: what you can't read, can't hurt you.        5.  Insist on universal free childcare. No one should be paid to do what a real Lady does in her home for free.        6.  Weed out uppity women through the establishment of HULA Committee: the House Committee on Un-Ladylike Activities.        7.  Procreation, not recreation. Where did so many gals get the idea that s_x is supposed to be f_n? It's time to close your eyes and do your duty!       Is that more acceptable to you?

20061127212402AAwHHKs	Social Science;Psychology	Depression?	I can't understand why i'm feeling so depressed lately.5 weeks ago,everything was flowing smoothly,ans then my grandfather passed away.I wasn't  so much sad,as i was overwhelmed at that  time,and have gotten over it,but it seems that lately i've just had a pattern of overanxious negative thinking(about other things) no matter what i do,or what activity i engage in.I'm almost having to become an insomniac and tire myself out to the point where i'm too tired to think.Could i just be going through some up's and down's right now?Are these normal patterns to be going through?I don't understan how i could be feeling so perfect a month ago,and so lousy lately.Almost like a 360 degree turn.It seemed that that event along with other things threw my thinking off kilter completely.
