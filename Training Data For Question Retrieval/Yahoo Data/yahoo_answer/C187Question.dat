I am quite a mature person in most areas of my life but in others i can be quite childish      for example college *college is free, parents do not pay for it*   my attendence is 51%   very low i know but i have had a running contition but alot of the time i just dont want to go so i dont      i blame my parents partly for this being so difficult   if i ever wanted a day off as a child and young teenager my mum would just let me stay home    i dont want a job   there are things im interested in and would like to do in my life but i dont want to have a schedule that i MUST stick to    heres where i get immature       i know i have to go to a job which will have a shedule to earn money for bills and such but ive just not be raised to HAVE to do things like this so i find it really difficult      what can i do to sort of ease myself into it    my attendence is getting better    had 100% attendence since returning after half term *2weeks*         dont have a go at me about being immature   im not trying to say im mature       i really think that if my parents were more strict with me going to school when i was younger and things like that (i dont have chores either, well i have to carry my pile of washing up and put them away, and do a quick clean of my room before my mum cleans it all) it wouldnt be so hard for me now         im 17 by the way   so getting a job is a in the near future thing   i have had one part time job before    in a supermarket in the summer   i DETESTED it beyond believe   i actually planned to get hit by a car so i didnt have to go to work    obviously i wouldnt actualy jump infront of a car but i wanted that badly not to go to work      i quit after 2 months

20090304124842AAjdY2e	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	What kind of recommendation should I give?	A friend of mine did me a HUGE favor by watching my son for me plenty of times when I went to class. She was great with my son and he really liked her. However as time went on my friend's personal life took a bad turn and it led to things being really bad in her professional life. She managed to get several jobs, but she kept losing them due to breakdowns and whatnot. I convinced her to go to get mental help and she was at a mental hospital shortly but she left. While there she was diagnosed as having borderline personality disorder. It hurt me but I stopped talking to her once she left because as a friend I couldn't continue to watch her destroy her life and make excuses for it.   Fast forwarding a few months, my friend is trying to get a job at a day care and I've been asked to give her a recommendation. She was wonderful when she watched my son, but her mental capacity lately has me a little concerned. I want her to get her life back on track and a job would help her to do so. She enjoyed working with children at the day care she was at before, but she got fired for not calling and not showing when her bus didn't come.   I want to give her a great recommendation, but being that she's working with children and is needing meds to keep her balanced, I don't know what I should suggest. Should I tell the person that runs the daycare center that my friend is a crapshoot because of her mental status? My friend was great with my son and she LOVED the daycare she was at before, but she's not very good in high pressure adult situations, however she'd lay down her life to protect a child and I know she'd never hurt one.   Should I be honest and say that I'm not sure about her mental state or should I just give her a glowing recommendation so that she could get her life back on track? I should also add that it was suggested that she get counseling for the borderline personality disorder, but she hasn't.

20090304125043AA2lQva	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Am I wrong to ask 12, 14 and 17 year old to do these chores to help out?	The 12 year old - to load up the dish washer every night, take the trash out, make his bed and help his dad to clean the windows once a month.      The 14 year old - put the dishes away, put washing from the machine into the dryer, help bathe the two and three year old with her 17 year old sister(They only do it friday night not every night) and to make her bed and fold washing.      The 17 year old - to help cook dinner, help bathe the two and three year old with her sister(Again only friday night), ironing washing, make her bed, dusting and vacuming. She also helps me get the younger children dressed and fed (she butters toast and pours milk on cereals) in the morning but I get them up. She just makes sure the 6,7 and 8 year olds are ok and dressed properly.      I asked this in the teen and preteen section but I got called lazy and not doing my job as a mum. My husband and I have 12 children aged 17, 14, 12, 8,7,6 4 year old twins, 3, 2 and 6 month old twins. My husband works long hours and works nights one week a month. I'm the one that drives everyone around, I do dusting and cleaning when the kids that are at home with me are napping so the 17 year old doesn't do it all. I don't just sit all day like people think I do.

20090304132211AA2xPp2	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	What do they mean when they say it takes a year?	for your body to adjust itself back into shape? What exactly does this mean? Your bones & internal whatnot's that need to go back, your physical external shape? Or everything?      The reason I am asking is because I have been doing very well with going to Pilate's, and everything is looking great and shrinking down beautifully. Initially everything was shrinking together, now it seems as if my waist has slowed down deflating lol. It doesn't look 'bad' but if it keeps this was my proportions are going to be a little weird. Even with the minor 'weirdness' it is still looking good :-)      How did it go for you? What was your experience? DId it take your body a full year?       I wish I had experienced 'mom' friends to chat about this with, but I was the first one to take the baby plunge.       Thanks guys!

20090304130652AAtMlRQ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	How much does your 3 month old eat.?	Mallory is 3 months old. She been just started taking a bottle of formula. I am no longer able to breastfeed her. We been having weight issue that admitted her two times in the hospital. And failure to Thrive. So she on high calorie formula. And have to feed her every three hours on schedule like the doctor had asked. So I am wondering how much a three month old should be eating. She been taking 2 and half ounce. But she not getting enough ounces for the day. How many ounces per day should she be taking. I am letting her take want she wants. We be seeing a dietian at children hospital. I am writing down what time she eating and how much she eating. I know each baby is different. I am just wondering how much she should be taking. How many cans a week you go through of powder formula has well. I have to use a three scoops of powder with 5 oz water to make it 24 calorie formula.    Thanks       I had to stop my breastfeeding because no matter want I did. Nothing work. I have to do want best for my baby girl and to keep her out of the hospital. She had a feeding tube which came out and they might put a new one in if she doesn't take amount she should be taking. Which I don't want that. And it seems my baby girl is more happy on the formula then breastfeeding. So don't say breastfeeding I can't and this only way I would keep not going back to the hospital.
20090304132000AARdfJV	Pregnancy & Parenting;Baby Names	Do you ASSOCIATE a name with the CHARACTERISTICS of people that HAVE that name?	If many people that share the same name have the same personality or perhaps the same physical attributes: Do you associate this name name with these characteristics?. For example:   All the females named Jamie that I know are very gorgeous and friendly, for this reason, when I heard the name Jamie I always thought of a very pretty girl with an amazing body.      But because I met a butch named Andrea when I heard this name I always thought of a shemale.       Thank you !!

The house is a mess and I feel like I can never catch up on school work (went back to college really late).  Have you ever felt like that? I feel like I am going to go crazy, like I have lost myself.  I'd go to a dr if I knew who to see... it seems like maybe a chemical imbalance is throwing me off too.  I am confused.  Any advice or suggestions would be wonderful.  I will report any nonsense answers.  Thanks!

20090304130729AAmEwM2	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	What's the best thing to do to diminish/conceal stretch marks while pregnant?	I thought I was saved since I'm 37 weeks and had no stretch marks at all until I woke up a few days ago with a couple next to my belly button. It's weird, they were not there the night before. I heard it has to do a lot with genetics but my mom had 4 kids and no single stretch mark. I thought I could be lucky. Anyway, I care because one of my passions in life is belly dancing and I am not ready to quit performing. I thought of laser removal but I heard it doesn't always work. Would it work if I do it soon? What else can I try? I ordered a creme I saw in Oprah but so far cocoa butter didn't stop them from coming. But I wasn't very consistent when applying it. Does make up work?

Has anyone had experience with their 1-year old starting to refuse to eat?      Here's the situation:      My sister-in-law is a stay-at-home mom with a 4 year old girl and a 19-month old boy.        Recently she has started baby-sitting (at her home) two other children, ages 3 and 9 months. (girl and her little brother)       In the last check-up HER 19-moth-old was at a low weight for his age (or possibly he hasn't gained as much since his last check-up as would be expected, I forget)        In the last few days he has completely lost his appetite and will hardly eat a thing. he doesn't APPEAR to be sick, except he did vomit at lunchtime (she didn't say if she had pushed him very hard to eat.) The foods he is refusing are some of his favorites..        She IS taking him to a pediatrician next week.       She was wondering if you all thought his refusal to eat could  have anything to do with the new children being in the house for most of the work-day. The 8-month-old she babysits does require alot of attention, perhaps it's jealousy? (as the baby, my sis's boy is used to being the center of her attention)       Any thoughts??      Thanks

I wanted to know, if you gals made one, and if you did ...did it work out just the way you wanted it to ..or did you have to sacrifice some things?    Mine is pretty basic...things like,    -baby is to be examined on my chest, unless medically unable to....   -Spouse or myself is to be with baby during examine and 1st bath   -Rooming in , unless I ask for her to be taken to the nursery.    -My husband and my Mom are the only ones allowed in the room during delivery..etc.      It became a 2 and half page deal...lol. But I want to make sure, things go a bit different then last time. Unless of course a medical emergency was to happen.    I am 30 weeks and 3 days along BTW. So I am trying to get everything, together...I hate procrastinating.lol.      --And NO Thumb Down Fairies Allowed!!!--

20090304135114AAbpZgR	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Can anyone say which of these is best?	A little painful to think about.. But during the birth, is it better to not have an episiotomy and risk tearing, or have the episiotomy because at least then the tear will be a neat line?      I was just wondering which would heal the best?

20090304133650AAlwdkT	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Do you think that breastfeeding will make a child's I.Q. drastically higher than if they were formula fed?	First of all, I agree that breast milk is the healthiest food for an infant.      The only thing that I am skeptical about is the "Higher IQ" argument.         I've met complete idiots who have poor grammar and low test scores that claim that they were breastfed as infants.      I've also met very intelligent people who were formula fed as infants.            I really don't see much of a correlation as far as I.Q. goes. I think an individual's DNA plays a MUCH larger role in a person's I.Q.         Health wise, breast milk is great, but I doubt that it will make a drastic difference to a person's I.Q.         What are your thoughts?
20090304135014AASvo0P	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	What do I say to these boys?	So today in lunch, these 2 boys called me fat. I did nothing to them. 1 of them came up to me and said he was just kidding, and the other did to later. I told them both not to talk to me anymore. I don't want to talk to them. They make my self-esteem go down. They have been doing it since 3rd grade. I am so sick of them. Everybody says I;m not fat, and I'm beautiful, but they make me feel fat and ugly. I don't know what to say or do.

Im not dangerous or angry towards my son though, and I have a great support system which includes my husband. Just litle things have been bugging me, and I just scream at my husband sometimes. It's horrible. That's uncommon for me. It's 3 months after birth. Can I ask my midwife about getting some hormones or whatever they prescribe, or would I have to go a doctor?
20090304134338AAe9YVR	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	How can I help a one and 1/2 yr old with attachment issues?	I have a friend of mine just got out of a horrible relationship.  She has two kids that are under 3.  She is currently staying with my family.  She worked while the father was suppose to be at home taking care of the kids.  We have now learned he didn't do that and pretty much just yelled at them to be "shut up" and put a bottle in their mouth.  The little girl, who is turning three tomorrow is doing tons better since they left him.  But the little boy really needs some help.  I can tell when I watch my friend.  Every time she gets up (doesn't even leave the room) he will start to cry.  It isn't an option to connect them back to the father (bad story).  So is there anything I can do to help him adjust to her even moving without him on her hip?  She seems to need the help.

20090304132637AA840er	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Could this have been from Vitex?	Ok a few weeks ago I took Vitex for about 10 days and around the 8th day I started my AF (which never comes without help medicinally). I hadn't had one since October. Well it got to be so heavy that I had to call the doctor. She put me on bed rest to slow it down for 4 days. I asked her if it could've been from the vitex, and she says "no" because it takes months to build up in your system. But I'm not convinced. Anyhow AF lasted 14 long days and finally the day after I was DONE, I got lower right cramping feelings (like ovulating pain, but I'm not sure what that would feel like since I'm annovulatory. I'm just guessing) That lasted 2 days (which would have been days 15 & 16 of my cycle)       My question is could this have been from the Vitex, or should I listen to my OBgyn and think that it was so heavy because of how long it had been? I hate not knowing if I will ever ovulate or not!!!

20090304133146AAmUvZV	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Do you think possibly pregnant?	So I had sex 3 weeks ago this past monday. I have been on Yaz for almost 2 years and I have never missed a day. I am very cautious. The intercourse only lasted about 5 minutes because I am such a paranoid person. Even though I was on the pill and haven't missed a day, I decided to take the Plan B pill. Now I was supposed to start two days ago, but I normally have 4 day window when I take my pill. I have taken two pregnancy tests and they were both negative. I don't think that I am pregnant, but the thought is in the back of my mind. I am in a committed relationship, so any outcome would be fine, but the best interest would be not.       I have taken the proper precautions, so do you think I could be? Please let me know. The Plan B also says it could cause you to be late, so?

20090304135722AAoWABL	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	Am i in the right or am i being petty?	i met a guy abroad and we became close over the holiday, he lives at the other side of the country to me though once back in england we still continued to see each other. we were never 'together' but i'd say we had a thing. this stopped when both of us met new partners. a couple of months ago we both came out of relationships and met up again for the first time in a while. we slept together, completly protected, (im on the pill too) but the condom ripped and anyway, now i am pregnant!   as i am only 18 (he's 19) i don't feel having a baby at this time in my life would be right due to alot of different circumstances i wont go into so i'm having an abortion.   i want the father to travel down to go with me to have it, as i don't think it's fair he can just carry on with whatever leaving me to go through this alone when it's just as much his responsibility/mistake. he says he doesn't want to pay the train fare down though just 'for that' causing arguments.   i do have family and friends who are very supportive, i just think that, why should they have to be dropping everything to go through this with me. I'm not blaming him for anything, of course it was nobody's fault this happened as we were protected, but im worried/scared and of course, im the one having to go through this abortion. why should he get to just carry on seeing his mates, having a laugh and get to avoid the whole situation?   what should i do?? am i being petty? or do i have a point?    :S

Im 4 months pregnant and while we both have jobs its still not enough to pay for having a baby, so i really need my medicaid.      we've been together for over 5 years and have lived together without any support of others besides medicaid and foodstamps(only 55 dollars to split between us a month) for a year.   we plan on getting married in may before the baby gets here.   not because im pregnant, because we were going to get married before this happened. i just feel it would be better for the baby and us if we move the date up to before august when the baby comes, but i cant lose my medicaid. will i lose it if i get married,we are both on the foodstamps and everything. we applied together so they have his and my income and it really hasn't changed.          please dont answer if your gonna be rude because you dont know me and iv seen people answer to other people my age who are pregnant as if they arent trying because they are pregnant and on medicaid...but im working 2 jobs and my boyfriend works atleast 9 hours a day we are making this work and are very much in love and have been for over 5 years, im not just some teen statistic that sits on her *** because she thinks her morning sickness is bad iv worked all through the first trimester and im only 18 weeks but i will continue to work until i have the baby so dont even bother if you think you know me and want to be mean.      and i know half this is spelled wrong im in a hurry and need answers fast....         again my question is, If i get married at 18 will i lose my medicaid,even though my boyfriend is 17 until august?and will they still pay for the delivery and doctors appointments?

20090304141532AAhcNnS	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	Autism in an 11 month old?	I know 11 months is pretty early to diagnose it, but I'm a bit concerned.   My 11 month old son is very smart and advanced in most areas, but displays a few typically autistic symptoms. He knows his name but often doesn't respond to it. He flaps his arms when he gets excited and still doesn't know how to clap. He knows how to wave hi/bye but doesn't understand when to do it.    But like I mentioned before, he's very smart.  He started rolling over at 10 weeks old, crawling at 5 months, pulling up by 7 months etc.  He is very good at imitating actions words and sounds. He has a pretty good vocabulary for his age (he says mom, dad, baba, kitty, tickle, more (muh), Uh-oh, whoa, and more). He knows how turn the tv on and off, and he's learning how to stack blocks.   Does it sound like he's possibly autistic or am I just being silly?

I just had my 2nd baby 7 weeks ago. I am exclusively breastfeeding him. I know that that isn't 100% effective for preventing pregnancy but kellymom.com seems pretty sure its like 95-98% or something...--->  http://www.kellymom.com/health/meds/birt...    I got the implanon birth control arm implant about a week ago. I was told to expect breakthrough bleeding for a few mths.   today I had a tiny bit of spotting...its unusual for me. neither of my pregnancies had any implantation bleeding....so i'm confused.   My hubby and I "did it" last night....lol...without a "back up method" the condoms we have burned and it was painful....probably since I had the baby not so long ago.   So we went without...would the next day be too soon for implantation bleeding?I feel so dumb having gone thru 2 pregnancies and not knowing this.lol      I don't WANT to be pregnant ...I mean it wouldn't be the end of the world but I want to enjoy my baby boy before we have another,ya know?   So what do you think? breakthrough bleeding or implantation?      (please,don't say "you should have thought of that" or anything dumb. I'm well aware the situation is my fault...)

20090304151417AATtaIf	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Is this ligaments stretching from growing belly or could it be something else?	Hello ladies. I hope everyone is doing well :) Im currently 22 weeks & 4 days. And Ive noticed whenever I walk for long periods of times Or more than 2-5 minutes straight, I get pain that hurts, and really uncomfortable In my lower abdomen. all on the outside. I just had a 3d ultra sound yesterday and Saw my baby, everything looked good still, And I can still feel him kicking me lots. But I was just wondering since this is my first pregnancy Is this just because My stomach is rapidly growing now? And the muscles are being pulled? Or could something else be up. It doesnt hurt when I sit, lay down, or even walk for a minute or two (to the bathroom, get mail ect). And I have no other symptoms at all. I made an appointment with my doctor, But they couldnt get me in until the 10th of March. And just told me the usual if it gets worst to see if they can get me in sooner, Or Go to the hospital. its not constant pain, as i said Only when I go for walks, to do my errands, Since I dont drive. I need to walk around which is usually only for 30minutes to maybe 3 hours total. Has anyone else had this? I never had this before from walking. ive had pain before and the doctor said thatw as ligaments being stretched. Im Just curious, and a little bit worried but Only because Im a first time mom to be. thank you!

20090304143229AAAgN5F	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	My daughter must be teething - I'm about to go nuts?!?	A few months ago, I swore my daughter was teething. Drooling bucketfuls and shoving fists in her mouth at all times, not just when she was hungry. No teeth ever showed up. Now, just a couple of weeks ago, I felt two swollen spots on her gums, but no teeth have poked through yet. She isn't ever eager to nurse - sometimes she will just fuss and fuss and nurse for 5 or 10 seconds and pull off and cry, and it is frustrating me to death. I feel like my hungry baby isn't eating! It has almost pushed me to the point of stopping breastfeeding. Also, she got a terrible diaper rash for the first time since she was born just a coupld of days ago, and she has been overall more fussy than usual, and has been tugging her ears (I read that was normal while teething).      Also - something very strange - she will not let me rock her. Period. It breaks my heart.. it used to be the way I got her to unwind, but she just goes crazy and hysterical when I try to rock her! Why is she doing this? I feel like her whole personality is changing! Is this normal for teething babies? Could it be something else?       She is 7 months old, by the way.

I eat well all throughout the day.  Healthy breakfast, lunch and dinner, but I am really starting to crave a lot of sugar, ie, cookies, I can't get enough gummy candy, and I've been really dying for a Sprite, which should be ok, as it is caffeine free.  I just always feel so guilty and feel like I shouldn't be eating the cookie and the darn Swedish Fish!!  I'll probably check with my doctor to see how much sugar is ok, but just wondering from other mom's also?? Also, at the grocery store last night I couldn't resist the "junk" in the freezer section!

Or my other fear is like that song that tells the father to leave the room because the baby's mom is fading fast. I know worrying is not good but sometimes I can't help it. I would like to hear from you ladies. Best-Wishes!!!

20090304145531AASSNUG	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	9 year old daughter's attitude?	I have a daughter that is 9 years old.  Lately she has been getting very mouthy.  She always has something to say back and bascially does not care what we think about it.  We have tried grounding her, she says "i dont care im already grounded"  I have tried explaining that I am the parent and what I say goes and that she doesn't have the right to snap back at me.  None of this seems to be working.  She does the same thing to her dad.  It is mostly bad at night before bed and in the morning.  Could she not be getting enough sleep, or is this normal 9 year old behavior?  And I am not going to start smacking her every time either, so please don't suggest that.

20090304143033AA0ErqF	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	I don't like that she does this.  Wife refusing to let my brother see his nephew, what to do?	My youngest brother called and asked if he could see his nephew.  My wife flat out doesn't allow it unless he's acting "proper".  He often gets into relationship troubles and comes to me about it.  As his big brother I feel it's my place to try to help him out.      She says I coddle him and she doesn't like me supporting his playboy ways.  She refused to allow him to see our daughter unless he was single, not planning on hitting a bar or party, and could prove it.      I don't like this.  I'd hate to sneak around her and allow him to see his nephew.  But that's the only thing I can think of.  Other parents, do you feel she's being unreasonable?
20090304141953AA7IjQ7	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Recurrent miscarriage and high level of natural killer cells?	My blood test results came back today for recurrent miscarriage.  I had two last year and I'm 40.  The test for natural killer cells came back as high.  From reading about it on the internet, it seems that we all have these killer cells, but if they are high, when you get pregnant, they treat the embryo as a 'invader' or 'cancer' and thereby kill it, thus resulting in miscarriage.      I just wondered if any of you had experienced this, and what was the outcome?  I've been told there is a medication to prevent this happening again (a steroid, called Prednisolone).        Any information or help on this would be appreciated.

My mom is always putting me down and saying that I would never make it to college because I can't get enough grades. Every time I tell her I want to be something when I'm older she makes up a reason why I can't. Like its bad for my back, I'm too short, too many years of college, i'd never be able to afford the college, it takes certain people to do that, etc. And it is ANYTHING i want to do, she tells me why I won't be able to. Her husband is always making comments about my wait. He tells me I'm too big and lazy and I need to go out and do something. If I don't have plans on a weekend he gets on me about my eating habits and how I need to go find a friend and all that. Then my mom has two little kids. I'm practicly the one raising them. I am forced to watch them during summer break and after school. Can I go to a foster home if I have my reasons? I am 13 about to be 14....

20090304144348AAt6mBr	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	How to deal with my hubbys ex when she miscarried and i am pregnant?	My Husband and I have been married for 7 months, and he has a 3.5 year old son with his ex. We decided a few months ago, that we didnt want to wait till he was in school to have our first. So, we start trying. His ex "supposedly" had a 9-month pregnancy with twins, and stillbirthed them BOTH. Though my stepson thought he was getting siblings, there has NEVER been proof of this. ever. So, she ends up pregnant IMMEDIATELY after the "stillbirths." Her husband is in the army and he came home for a few weeks in december, the day after the still births. We decided to try in the first week of december. Well, I found out I was pregnant, and 3 days later, my husband's ex miscarries. I feel totally awful for her, but im not sure what to say.       Come to find out, she is totally upset that Im pregnant [we would have been 5 weeks apart.] and that I dont try to hide the fact. my status' on my myspace and aim have a baby count down[7ws! Love you baby!] stuff like that. This is my first child, and my husband and I are absolutely THRILLED! But no one, no matter how much i dislike her, should have to deal with a miscarriage, and im not sure how to deal with her. I do NOT say anything about my pregnancy to her. She messaged me "congratulating" me and giving me tips on my pregnancy. This was strange because we never got along. EVER. We got into a huge argument because she was going around telling everyone she was always in my face and bullying me, which is not true, and that I was afraid of her, and how shallow I was because I try to be my stepsons "mother" . I admit that I do act like a "mother" but thats because when he is with me, i am a "mother-figure" and love and care about him. HOWEVER, i do not try to replace her.       Ok, just a little background. what do i do? i dont want to seem like i "flaunt it" but she is constantly lying and exaggerating about me and what i do. and i dont want to "hide" that im pregnant!!      HELP!

20090304145446AAMGHA2	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	I was supposed to get my period about 2 weeks ago now..?	My boyfriend of a year and I have unprotected sex all the time, and he always finishes in me. I've been on birth control the whole relationship, and this is the way we've always been, and i've never gotten pregnant. I lost my last months birth control, and my boyfriend knew this, and stupidly we had almost everyday unprotected anyways. My period was due about a week and a half, to two weeks ago. I took a pregnancy test, the ones you can take 5 days before your missed period about 5 days ago, and the results said i'm not pergnant, so what could be going on? I've always thought I was going to be one of those women who's bodies isnt able to have kids, because ive always had unprotected sex with every partner, and i almost always forget to take my birth control, but still i've never gotten pregnant. And i don't excersize constantly, so i know im not not getting my period because of that. could the test have been wrong? should i be noticing any signs by now if im pregnant?

Ok, so I know she is pregnant and I look exactly like I did eight months ago but I am starting to get annoyed.      I work 55-60 hours a week, she works 20 at Starbucks for the benefits.  I come home, the house is a disaster, she has either slept all day or watches tv all day.  So after an 11-hour shift, I cook dinner, I clean up, I check over her girls homework and put them to bed.  Then I go to bed and she gets pissed at me because I don't want to have sex with her.        Ok, don't take this the wrong way, but I am not one of these pregnant is beautiful guys.  I think bringing a life into the world is amazing and we have been blessed, but I do not like big girls.  She doesn't look like the pregnancy magazines, where they are fit women with big bellies, she looks like Oprah in her really heavy years.  She is 200lbs and it turns me off.  I sucked it up from month 3 to month 6 but now that I have to have sex with a big woman who is also extremely lazy, I just can't do it. (It also kinda freaks me out that my son is right there too) I love to cuddle with her, because I love her and she is a good woman, but I just cannot have sex with her.        So this has put a strain on our relationship.  What do I do?  Also, for you pregnant women, is it normal for you to help with nothing around the house?  Should I argue my case or just shut my mouth and deal with it?  I have always done my half and she will agree to this, but all of it and bring home the bacon?  This has been going on for 3 months now and I am feeling used and abused.

Some days I can't think of anything positive.  I'm 19 but I'll be 20 this summer when the baby is born.  I have always been mature and I really think I can handle a baby, that isn't the issue.  I just feel emotionally drained, as if I have NO feelings what so ever.  It's weird.  Some days I can't think of anything positive about having the baby and I no that can't be true.  In the beginning I was so excited to have him and now I just feel worthless and hopeless.  I'm going to be able to stay full time in school because fortunately my family is getting me through it.  I have NOTHING to be depressed about.  I have a beautiful baby entering into this world and an amazing family to help me through, yet I just feel so emotionless.  Less excited, negative thoughts constantly, almost like I am just so useless and my life is set out for me and I have no choice over my future anymore.  Does this sound like depression, will medicine help?    Has any other people felt this way and once baby was born felt a lot better?   Please help me, I'm so scared =[

20090227075610AAS5XgR	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Home education in the spotlight again.?	So nothing divides opinion more (other than smacking) than the question of home schooling.   Apparently the UK Government want to curtail home schoolers because they are worried that children out of the school system are open to being abused within the family.   The argument before that was that home schooled kids didn't;t get as good scores in tests as school kids...but the added all the kids that where excluded from school and not schooled at all.   So do you think its a right to choose how you educate your child or do you think the govermnet are right?

The father wants to visit his daughter every year for 14 days (supervised with mother or other person that mother can choice) and a weekly phone call.  You will not get any child support other than the things he buys her when he visits her.  The father will expect the mother to be diplomatic friendly with him and he will do the same.  This is the only way that, the father will not take you to court.  If you do a Family court may order her to leave the country for visitations with her father.  He does not want to do this, but if you don’t cooperate he will.

20090304141605AALzRLL	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adoption	Does "Birthmother's Day" offend you? (As a birth/first/bio mother)?	It kind of offends me, personally.   When I first saw a calendar with it on the sunday before Mother's Day, I got mad. I thought of "Birth Mother's Day" and "Regular Mother's Day"    I felt like it was implying that birth mothers were different, or weren't real mothers.    Also, at first I thought if there was Birth Mother's Day, shouldn't there be an Adoptive Mother's Day too?    Then I realized that's just ridiculous! Too many different categories for being a mother!   Just because I'm not raising my child I have to be classified as a different kind of mother?     What's your opinion?
20090304104943AAR8pWw	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Moms, this is worth it right?	My sister in law who is pregnant with her 1st baby is literally dirt poor. Her husband and her bring home a combined $350 per week and we live in a VERY expensive area.      Anywho, she is 7 months pregnant and has NOTHING for the baby. She wants my crib, my carseat, my stroller, my changing table and basically everything I owned but I really am planning on having another baby soon so Im just not willing to give it up.      Then just yesterday I found a crib, mattress, and swing chair on craigslist for $40!! Only problem is this is an hour and a half away.      It came with pics and looks pretty good. "Gently used" Ironically its all the same exact stuff my baby daughter has.      My husband doesnt think a 1.5 hr drive is worth it but I do! All that stuff for $40 is a great deal I think. Plus, then I wont look like the bad guy when I say NO to giving up all my baby furniture.

20090304124307AA2pVQv	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Do most first-time grandmothers have a hard time adjusting to their new role?	My mother and I have always been at odds, but ever since I had my son, things have been getting a little worse between us.  My mother is the kind of woman who is used to being in charge.  She's had to be.  My dad suffered brain damage when I was young and I have a disorder on the high-functioning end of the autistic spectrum.  She's always been very overprotective, often to the point of infantilizing me.      Now that I have a son, my mother keeps trying to take charge and be the mother.  She treats me like I'm my son's older sister instead of his mother.  She gives other new mothers friendly advice, but with me, she barks orders.  Like she thinks I won't understand if she doesn't talk to me like I'm an idiot.  I don't do well with barked orders.  It's true--I have my own ways of adapting and interacting with the world around me, and I know my ways are a bit strange to some, but they work for me.  My mother doesn't understand this.  I'm not adverse to recieving some well-worded advice; in fact, I need and welcome it.  But not to the point where my son starts thinking that the word "Mommy" is synonymous with "older sister."      Do all first time grandmothers have a hard time letting their daughters be mothers?  Might her behavior have to do with her perception that I'm somehow inept due to my condition?  Or could it be that she and I just clash and will never see eye to eye?  I would like some other opinions because I'm stuck in a loop on this one.  I have asked my mom, but she doesn't seem to be able to put a sentence together without screaming at me and letting the insults fly.  And when she does that, I can't understand her.

It was so so embarrassing. It was one of those really long white art galleries with loads of rooms. He told me he needed to pee at the last minute.. and we didn't make it in time.       Another time was 3 years ago... my twin daughters were 3 and were bridesmaids in a church. They were standing either side of the alter and the priest was giving his emotional talk, when suddenly there was this gushing sound... oh the shame! I felt so bad for the newly married couple. Still, it was a taster of what was to come for them!

20090304125141AAJHEvI	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Please answer . . . Does this sound realistic for a single mom?	Okay . . .       I'm a single mom (21) who is still living at home. I have a 6 month old son. My mom is really encouraging me to finish college and to get a career. I am extremely grateful for all that my mom and brother do for me.      Okay, here is my concern. Even though I am a single mom, I want to do the best I can to raise my son as much as possible. That means, avoiding babysitters, day-cares, and public schools (I want to home-school) as much as possible. I thought to become a nurse, that way I only have to work 3-4 days a week (since they work 12 hour shifts) and do graveyard. That way I can make enough money to support us, as well as be home all day.       I thought on the nights I have off, I could get a full night's sleep (which would be 3-4 nights a week), as well as taking a good nap during the day when I worked the night before.      I'm starting to worry that my plan is extreme . . . Is it realistic that I can survive with such a sleep/work schedule? Have you known a single parent who had night job and made it?      Please no insults, I'm really looking for constructive criticism and advice. Does this seem realistic?

20090304122203AAkBc4D	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Feeding a baby, some questions.?	I have some questions about feeding your baby. They may sound stupid, but it's really to determine if i need a bottle heater or not and to help with my decision on how i'm going to feed my baby.       - If you're bottle feeding formula to your baby do you need a bottle warmer? One that keeps it warm for several hours? Example, if you're out shopping and you've been out longer than expected, but you made up some bottles before going out, do you need to keep those bottles warm or can you feed them to your baby cool?      - Does expressed breast milk need to be kept warm? If you're going shopping and your baby is needing a feed, does the milk need to be warm or can it be cool?      - If you express your milk into bottles, i was told you'd need to do so every few hours to stop your boobs becoming sore and engorged, so if it was around the time you were to express your milk, would your breasts become very sore and start leaking if you don't pump around that time?      - If you formula feed, how long does it take for your boobs to stop leaking and stop being so sore?      - In relation to the first 2 answers, i'm asking that because i don't know if it's essential to have one of those bottle heaters for when you're out and about and your baby needs fed.

20090227075615AAYGxpV	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	How would have you handled this?	Last night, about 2 hours after I put my son to bed, he woke up screaming. It was one of those cries that make you drop everything and run to see what is wrong. He screamed for 15 minutes as if in pain. I finally got him calmed down enough to start putting him back to sleep. While he was lying next to me on my bed he started having strange breathing patterns. It was almost like an asthmatic would breathe while having an attack, very harsh and wheezing. He did that for about a minute then went back to breathing normally. It happened twice in a five minute span. It could not see if he was turning blue because it was dark in the room.      After he went to sleep I called his pediatrician (after hours it connects you to the Children's Hospital in our area) and spoke with a doctor. She said she didn't know what would cause a baby to breathe like that, but that is was reassuring that he worked his breathing out by himself. She told me to keep an eye on him and if it happened again to turn the light on and see if he turns blue around the mouth. If that happened I would have to take him straight to the emergency room.       I ended up putting him in bed with me last night. I was so scared it would happen again and he wouldn't be able to get over it himself. He slept fine after everything happened and is doing fine today.       Has anyone ever experienced this with their baby? Do you think that my son could have asthma? I have an appointment with his pediatrician on March 2 and will tell them about what happened, I would just like some opinions.

I gave him some children's benydrl and it got no worse. the next day he got in the tub with his new Loreal kids bath soap and immediatly he was full body red, raised tiny little spots. I took him out of the tub, he is not itching or complaining, but they are everywhere. I called the doctor and they said if it's not bothering him, just treat with benydrl every 4 hours.

20090304140651AAXQfME	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Are these pains normal?	I'm 5.5 weeks pregnant and have pain on both sides where seemingly my ovaries are. Also sometimes have little pinches in my hips, and aches out at my waist line. I'm most concerned about the ovary type pain because I had an ectopic 12 years ago (I don't remember much except the excruciating pain after my tube burst).       This is my first pregnancy since then, and I'm really nervous that something will go wrong. I've had blood work and an U/S...last week at 4 weeks 5 days. They only did one HCG test because it was at 1500; then the following day did the scan that showed an empty sac in uterus. My Dr. told me that occasionally with Ectopics you get a psuedo-sac in the uterus which isn't a true fetal sac. I have another U/S tomorrow morning and I'm terrified that they will find this to be ectopic.       Has anyone else experienced these lower ovary area type aches/pains and had a normal pregnancy?

I know this may seem a little weird considering this is my third baby, but this is the first time I have ever been sick while pregnant. Any answers are greatly appreciated!

I was lucky enough to be able to feel my baby's flutters on a daily basis from 16 weeks but in the past few days I haven't been able to feel any flutters :(  But I've been getting some tugging/internal pulling sensation on and off instead.        I was wondering if anyone else experienced a similar thing and if this may be a change in baby's movement or if it's just some kind of muscle spasm??      Thanks!

20090227074515AASLMnE	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	HELP PLEASE ?!?!?!?!?	I let my sister and her boyfriend move in with me and my husband and our one year old, they needed some help and feel behind on their bills so they asked us if they could stay here for a month or two, well my husband didnt want them too move in but I pushed him to let them move in cause i was worried they wouldnt have anywhere to live. Anyways Neither of them had jobs when they moved in, 3 weeks went by and everyday they would have a excuse of some kind of reason for not being able to go out and look, they would sleep in til 12 and somehow they have money for cigarettes but not food, they eat whatever we have in our kitchen....... I finally took them aside and talked to them and yelled at them and told them i was giving them one more chance then they both found jobs by the end of the week and I THOUGHT things were going to be different but its only been a week since they started their jobs and they are already calling in sick to work, my husband was pissed last night because he had bought $20 in steak and planned to grill this weekend but when we got home they had already ate all the steak, I feel horrible, my husband works hard and I stay home and he is supporting everyone and it is taking a toll on him, I JUST WANT THEM OUT but I care about them, I dont want to hurt them ......... I worry if I kick them out they will have no where to go.... What do I do ??????

20090304120108AAaKSEL	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Chances of being pregnant?	Please don't critisise me, im not asking to be judged.I'm nineteen and y boyfriend is twenty. The legal age in britain is sixteen. Basically foolish us engaged in heavy petting and the such without protection(Will not happen again). He also rubbed his genitals against mine. However I was on my period(yes i know,yuck,dont judge) and he was hard but didnt come, I'm aware though that precum could have come into contact with me. I know technically I should take a pregnancy test to make sure, but before I do, whats the chance of me having gotten pregnant?(due to me mentstruating and all other factors),  It was the first time i've done anything like this,im a virgin and there was no actual penetration off of him or his fingers,just rubbing. I'm planning on getting the contraceptive pill  &condoms this week so i'll probably have to be checked over to make sure i'm not pregnant or something.

20090304124042AAmvgJl	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Is there a way to explain to a child that you cannot afford these things?	I'm hoping without hurt feelings.      My son sometimes expresses interest in a cell phone, a music player, handheld gaming system, all these things and more are things his friends have.  And he wants one too.  Whether he wants it for good reason or to fit in I'm not sure.      As far as things go, money is a bit tight.  We don't have that many "luxuries".  We have the computer, television in the living room, and a Wii.  I have a cell phone, but for work reasons.  He hasn't even got a television in his bedroom as many of his friends do.      And I hope like at least most parents I hate crushing the little guy.  Whenever I say "We'll see" he'll always reply with "Just say no."  Personally I think at the age of eight he shouldn't have a cell phone anyway.  But the biggest problem is I can't afford it.

20090304132402AAQuJhc	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	18 month old whines & throws self to ground very hard..help??!?	My son is 18 months and just within the past three weeks has started whining for anything and everything. He is not talking much and I know he's getting frustrated not being able to communicate. He understands a very large amount of commands and what we're saying but lately he just won't listen or cooperate. The biggest problem is that when he throws a fit he tilts his head back and almost always will allow himself to fall to the ground. Most of the time he will hit head head on the floor or the arm of a chair/couch unless his father and I are right there while he's throwing his fit. I can't be right next to him everytime he starts whining but because he keeps falling and hurting himself I try to rush to him when I see him throw his head back so I can catch him before he hits his head again. When he throws his head back he does not look where he's going or seem to care. I think rushing to him and trying to keep him from falling is making it worse but I've tried ignoring him (but still watching him when he doesn't know it) and also have tried picking him up and sitting him in a soft chair but neither works. He'll either hit his head from throwing himself back if I'm not right next to him or he'll scoot down the chair to the floor while crying and screaming and hit his head there. Just an FYI- he's not intentionally hitting his head, it just happens because of how he tilts his head way back while screaming and throwing his fits. I'm really stressed and desperate. I don't want to let him cry it out because I can't figure out a safe place for him to do it without still ending up on the floor. His crib and play pen are worse because he'll fall into the wood bars and get hurt worse or fall into the mesh of the playpen with his face and get hurt or hurt his neck from the way he falls straight into it. Any ideas or advice please? Any one have  a child that did something like this???

20090304105443AATwtej	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Bring them to court over the baby or not?	Hi, 23 year old male here. I met a girl in an online game and we were friends for months. We both started having relationship problems at the same time and ended up breaking up at the same time. She was in Connecticut telling me she's moving back home to New Mexico since her and her bf weren't getting along. I offered a resting point in Wisconsin for her at my house and so she came and stayed for like 3 nights before returning home. We liked eachother so much that I quit my job and moved all the way to New Mexico paying for an apartment for me and her. This hit off right away I thought it was love for sure until she stopped saying she loved me and she wasn't kissing me goodbye or anything. I was being lazy about finding a job but everything around the house to fix up the apartment so she could live nicely I did. One night I was sick so I sat in bed waiting for her to join me and then I heard her leave so I tried calling her and texting her letting her know that I needed her but no response. Worried about her I got on her computer and looked to see who she was talking to online maybe that would clue me into what was going on. She was cybering with him on webcam which made me even more sick then I saw something that straight made me puke. She had been chatting with a guy who isn't her ex bf but her husband telling him things about how she's using me for money and that she still loves him. So I confronted her about it when she snuck inside at 5 am. She told me sorry she doesn't know what else to say and then she told me she didn't want to just be friends with me she was going to get a divorce and be with me and only me. Not even 4 days later she went back to him and was telling me she's moving out. I didn't want to get stuck in an apartment by myself in a state i don't have friends or family so I moved all the way to North Dakota to be with my ex gf who had her mom beg me to come stay with her. Not even a week gone the girl from New Mexico calls me up saying she's pregnant. So, she begs for me back and says she's never been so alone and talking all this suicidal stuff and I'm worried about only one thing the baby so I borrowed money from my mom and moved all the way back to New Mexico. Then the same thing happened not even being there a full month. She dumped me for her husband again. I'm wondering if she was pregnant before meeting me or if it really is mine. She says it's definately mine and says the due date is June 18th. We're still talking and on good terms but she's telling me that her husbands family thinks it's his and he's knows it's mine. They're going to give my daughter his last name and pretend it's theirs not mine, have her call him dad and everything. The catch to it all is he's in the military and she says if she gets a paternity test he would get in trouble and kicked out. I would end up spending way more time and money than it's worth if it ends up it's his kid though. Plus, if I get it tested by court I might end up having to pay child support and still not get custody since i'm living in Maryland and she's in California now. The other thing is I'm currently unemployed with no money. I could borrow money from family for court maybe but is it worth it? I don't trust this girl with my daughter but it seems there's not much I can really do about it because it's kinda more her daughter than mine. She tells me she doesn't even love her husband, it's more of a motherly bond which is kinda disgusting to me too. I told her to give the baby her maiden name but she's not going to. She's a good friend still and I can't hate her but I can't see how she calls herself human.

Im a girl btw.
20090304113031AAMEjeK	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Has anyone been in a similar situation?	I did IVF in January.   All looked good.  I got a positive pregnancy test.  My hcg levels did rise-perhaps not as high as should be but they still continue to rise.   I went for an ultrasound last week....the fertility clinic said I should have been around the 7 week mark. A gestational sac was seen and nothing more.  Another 2 hcg blood test.  Still continue to rise.   Days ago, I had a single wipe of red blood...went right to brown...that was it.  I am scheduled for another scan tomorrow to see if anything has changed.   I have been a complete wreck. I want to hang on to that small glimmer of hope but I have already prepared myself for the loss of this pregnancy.  I anticipate it is a blighted ovum...I know sometimes you read that the positioning during the scan could have something to do with why they never saw a heartbeat etc.     From the date of the egg retrieval (the day we see it as conception) it would only have been 5 weeks or so when I did the scan.   But the infertility clinic calculates it  back 2 weeks from the egg retrieval date.   I feel crampy here and there...like my period is coming.   I have also been on progesterone vaginal suppositories and estrogen tablets since the IVF started....I was told that if I am going to miscarry, the progesterone delays it because it has thickened the lining of the uterus alot,,,but it won't completely stop it.   I have been advised to continue on with the medication until the scan is over in the event they see something.   I have prayed to God for a miracle.....I feel like I have lost most of my faith as I prayed continuously throughout the whole time.   How could this be happening when we want a baby so bad.   I am 39 years old and feel like I am running on less time.   We tried for the last 3 years to conceive..had a pregnancy that ended up in a blighted ovum in 2006.   Does anyone out there have any comments for me.

20090304114553AAddZze	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	My 8 1/2 month old daughter has started crying unless someone holds her or constantly plays with her.  HELP!!?	My biggest concern is when she's at daycare.  My daughter use to lay down for naps with no problem at all.  She either falls asleep in your arms or while drinking her bottle.  You could lay her down and she'd be out for 2-3  hours.  NOW if you lay her down, BOOM, up pops her head, and she's wide awake screaming.  I usually have to go through the process 2-3 more times before she'll stay napping.  Also, she now only naps for 10-30 minutes at a time, so I don't think she's getting enough sleep.  It's really effecting daycare, because they can't hold her all the time and she's screaming so loudly that it keeps the others awake.  What can I do??       OH...I wouldn't consider her spoiled because I've always allowed for alone play time for her to learn the right skills as well as I've tried the "cry it out" method, but she screams bloody murder until she basically can't breath anymore, so I have to pick her up.  I need HELP...and I mean REAL suggestions please!  If you feel like putting me down for any reason, you're wasting your time.  Thanks for any "REAL" info.
20090304114954AA9S9My	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	How effective is the morning after pill if you take it three hours after sex?	Me and my boyfriend accidentally had sex two days ago. Without a condom. We didn't mean for it to happen, it just kind of did. I wasn't ovulating at the time, and I still had 9 more days until I was. And I then took the morning after pill three hours later. That means it's really effective, right? Like, what's the percentage chance that I could get pregnant?   Is the morning after pill very effective this way? It was taken as a precaution, just to stop my boyfriend from worrying.

20090304121336AAjf8VH	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	I really think something is wrong with me..?	Last month I had 2 positive pregnancy tests, and then I had a period. Turns out I had a chemical pregnancy. This past month my husband and I did only the pull out method, and I hear all of these stories girls get pregnant and is almost never works.Even though we aren't TTC right now we both expected to be pregnant this month... my hubby has even been rubbing my belly and acting like I had a baby in there. I took two HPT and both were neg. (morning urine). I went to the doctor today and the urine test was also neg. My period is due today and I have all the signs of both pregnancy/period: cramping, eating more, weight gain, sore/itchy boobs, and so tired I can't stay up. I'm only 20 and have regular periods but I'm starting to think something is wrong with me. I really do want kids one day.

20090304142722AAISWrJ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Are these Pregnancy Symptoms?	My last period was the 28th of January but in February I didn't have one.  My average cycles is normally 28 days long and I am regular (I have not missed a month) So I would have been due the 24th. And it still hasn't came. And around the 17th or 18th I started getting headaches on and off and also cramps on the left and right side of my abdomen sometimes it felt crampy and then there were times it was a pulling type cramp around my pelvic area. Also about 2 or 3 days after that I started feeling the cramps in my lower back. (I never had any of that before and its not a continuous cramp either) And recently I started getting this clear/whitish watery discharge??        I took a test this morning and it was negative??? (my mom says I should take a blood test cause with her she did not have a positive till she was 4 months)       Of course me and my husband weren't careful, so there could be a possibility im pregnant.      Basically what im asking is did you guys have any of these symptoms before finding out you were pregnant??

Yesterday I called my son's insurance company (FL Kidcare) and got a live person. The option of "press 0" was there.      Today, I don't hear it. I've pressed EVERYTHING to get a live person, with no success.       I'm going to kill someone. I hate automated systems. Especially when I'm pressed for him and only have a 15 mins to try and do this!      How do you bypass and get a LIVE person? Pressing buttons just kicked me out and they hung up on me.       Anyone have any tricks to get real people?      (And think of how many jobs we can create if we STOP with these stupid things and employe real live people???)      And I don't know where to put this. It said to put it in the gay, lesbian section????

20090304152357AAssxir	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	When do you have implantation bleeding?	lemme explain some things first. I just had my 2nd baby 7 weeks ago. I am exclusively breastfeeding him. I know that that isn't 100% effective for preventing pregnancy but kellymom.com seems pretty sure its like 95-98%  http://www.kellymom.com/health/meds/birt...    I got the implanon birth control arm implant about a week ago. I was told to expect breakthrough bleeding for a few mths.   today I had a tiny bit of spotting...its unusual for me. neither of my pregnancies had any implantation bleeding....so i'm confused.   My hubby and I "did it" last night....lol...without a "back up method" the condoms we have burned and it was painful....probably since I had the baby not so long ago.   So we went without...would the next day be too soon for implantation bleeding?I feel so dumb having gone thru 2 pregnancies and not knowing  this.lol      I don't WANT to be pregnant ...I mean it wouldn't be the end of the world but I want to enjoy my baby boy before we have another,ya know?   So what do you think? breakthrough bleeding or implantation?       (please,don't say "you should have thought of that" or anything dumb. I'm well aware the situation is my fault)

20090304152436AAHwf6Y	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Would this make you uncomfortable?	My baby (5 1/2 months old) stays with a woman 4 days a week while I work.  She home-schools her two children, and they are a wonderful family.  When I called to check on him today, she said he was sitting with one of her children watching a creation science movie.  This made me very uncomfortable because I do not believe in creation science and I don't want him getting mixed messages.  My husband said it doesn't matter because our baby is too young to understand.  What do you all think?  I don't want to insult her beliefs, but I also don't want to confuse him when he is at a more impressionable age.  Should I wait and see if it is an issue when he is older and could understand, or try to talk about it now?  Am I just being a worry-wart?   Thank you all!

Recently he has been waking up at around 4 every morning, and he's ready to go for the day. The past two nights, I have tried keeping him up past his normal bedtime to see if that will help him sleep a little later in the morning, but that hasn't seemed to help at all. I have also tried playing one of those baby Einstein CD's for him while he sleeps, and having him sleep with me. Nothing is working. I'm just worried that he isn't getting enough sleep. He naps throughout the day, but those seem short too. Usually 30-45 minutes at a time, about 3 or 4 times a day.      Does anyone have any other tips and tricks to try to get him to sleep better?

I know you can still get pregnant doing what we did, but i knew it was very unlikely.. she claimed i got her pregnant (she told me this after the fact i left her for her being crazy). she said she went to her gynecologist (who she said is also her uncle) and he said she was pregnant. she claims to have gotten the abortion pill (NOT plan B just to clarify) and she showed me some sort of receipt for 540$. she said the pill didnt work and her uncle gave her another abortion pill a few weeks later and now she wants the $540 for the "second" pill. what should i do? she is very capable of a crazy lie like this just to keep me talking to her. would a woman even be given the pill TWICE? i didnt think so...  I told her i wanted to speak with her uncle and she said the best she could do was show me receipts. i said i would only pay her if i talked to him and she said i couldnt because of the "hipaa" privacy law.. she said she would make my life a living hell and has threated to send the stuff to my parents (she does not know where they live or who they are, but if there is a will there is a way i guess..) do you all think shes a lier? PS, we are in college so and i know its a stupid thing to do! text messaging is the only form of communication, and now i dont even write back. Help!!

20090304151301AARAdFG	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Why is my son eating so MUCH?	My son will be 6months in 2 days.  For the last 2-3 days he has been EXTREMELY cranky.  Crying a LOT.  The ONLY thing that seems to help him is giving him a bottle!  He has about 6-8oz of formula but then that will last him maybe 2 hours at the most.  He also has 2 jars of baby foods a day Stage 2.  He eats those like nothing.  Within 5 minutes the entire jar is wiped completely clear and he still cries for more (which I have refused because I think it is WAY too much!  He just started Stage 2 about 2 weeks ago).  With the jar foods they last him maybe an hour before he is crying for a bottle!  It feels like he is eating way too much, but he seems to just constantly be hungry the last 2-3days.  He goes to the bathroom with no problem, doesn't seem to be a tummy ache.  He is definately teething.  Drooling all over the place, chewing/guming EVERYTHING he can get his hands on.  Including MY hands & Daddys & 4 year old sisters, lol.  I have tried a pacifier and nothing.  Could he be growing through an extreme growth spurt or something?  He was born at a healthy 8lbs, and now weighs about 17lbs & growing non stop!  Anyway...yeah, does this seem like a lot to you?      7 or 8 - 7oz bottles a day of formula   2 - Stage2 Jar foods       And NOTHING ever satisfies him....he still cries for more...but I'm scared of over feeding...remember this is recent...the last 2-3days of constantly wanting food.

20090304150501AAjB7Z0	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Silly Question...Or Not Really?	Okay I've been taking prenatal vitamins since I found out I was pregnant, in August we lost the baby at 5 months gestational, and I've continued taking the vitamins. I have since switched from the prescription to the over the counter type, with a folic acid supplement.       My question is, hubby takes the prenatals as well. He takes them mostly because they make him feel so much better than any other vitamins have. I know that when we're trying to conceive it's a good idea to keep taking the vitamins, that way we get our bodies prepared and such, but does it help men at all?

I have talked to my doctor, my OB, and the poor nurse who answered my call at the local OBS clinic about the pain I've been feeling in my lower abdomen.  They all agree that it is round ligament pain.      I would feel better about that, except at 10 weeks I had to go to the ER to find out why I was spotting.  At the time I had a less intense version of this pain I'm feeling now. (Everything turned out okay, but still...)      Now I just can't get that early trip to the hospital out of my head.  Every time I move and I get that sharp pain, I am scared about what I'm going to see at my next trip to the bathroom.      Has anyone been ASSURED by their doctors that they had round ligament pain only to find out their babies were in danger for some reason?  (I'm hoping I get a lot of "no"s on this question!

So i'm wondering, what else would cause it to jump this high?      Thanks in advance.

20090304151804AAZRCIl	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	My period is due today, ive been discharging alot since last week, with a little bit of cramping?	My boobs started hurting like a week ago but the pain goes away, i think it because im should be getting my period soon, my period is due today, im also discharging alot since last week every time i go to the restroom and pee some discharge comes out, it doesnt have a scent or odor, its just white and slippery. ive been having light cramping also, it kind of feels like im ovulating. what can it be? My last LMP was Friday feb 06. I went to go see my husband on friday the 13th -Monday the 16th. I have a 26 day cycle, If the last day we had sex was the 16th,  since my cycle is 26 days that mean i ovulated before the 18th right? so if the last day i had sex was the 16th is there a chance that i could be pregnant. sinc esperm can live up to 72 hours? My husband and i both want a baby were both 25 my clock is ticking lol I just dont want to get to excited, then i'll get disappointed. Thanks!

20090304151114AACQ3VR	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Question about af or something else?	Ok I tried asking this question in the ttc board but figured you all might have a little more experience to be able to answer my question.       Well my dh and I are ttc and I quit taking my pills in the middle of my pack in January. I had the reg withdrawal bleed and figured that is when my period would come from now on. I thought my period began like clockwork last friday. Well, I had slight bleeding for a day and a half and by sat night, it was gone. I spotted for a couple days but it never was A LOT of blood at any given time. My question is "Should I consider this as my 'normal' period or is something else going on?" This is nothing like any period I've ever had before. I took a hpt early friday morning and got a neg, then "started" around noon so I figured I was out for this cycle, but something isn't right.      This isn't my first time to quit taking birth control. Before I was on the pill for 4 years then quit taking it in the middle of a pack and began having a normal peirod in sync with my withdrawal bleed. This time I was only on the pill for 5 months before I quit taking it. I really thought that that was what would happen this time.       I'm just really confused and would love any information that you could give me. Thanks in advance.

20090304152257AAB54g9	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Any reasons not to feed a baby solids at 2 1/2 months old if he shows multiple signs he's ready?	I started my son on the 1st foods about a week ago (he was born 12/12/08, so he is almost 3 months old). Here's the background:   He was eating 5 oz of formula every 3-4 hours since he was 3 weeks old (I know, 5 oz is a lot, but no spit-up, and he stopped when he was full every time, so it wasn't 5 oz each and every time), and a few days in a row he was just screaming the hungry-scream every 2 hours almost all day. I was having to fend him off with the pacifier, which meant sitting there for 2 hours with a screaming baby and popping that binky back in between screams. Hellish. Before I decided to go off the deep end, I decided to give some cereal a try. He ate that stuff up! But then the constipation that folllowed was worse than the pacifier incident. So, I decided to give the 1st foods that my sister in law had given me a try. He ate the entire jar of applesauce, drank 3 oz of formula, and then slept for almost 7 hours! My husband, worried that I am destroying his child's innards by feeding him when he's hungry, looked up some article that was a checklist of signs that your baby is ready to eat baby food. He had all but 1! He can hold his head up, doesn't push food out with his tongue, moves food around in his mouth with his tongue, and is still hungry after ample formula feedings. The only thing he can't do that was on the list is sitting up by himself.   I didn't feed my daughter food until she was ready, probably about 4 1/2 or 5 months. I'm not one of those gung-ho moms that just things that a 2 week old is ready for a pureed sirloin or some crap. I think people like that are everyone (doctors, nutritionists, etc.) says not to give them anything but formula until 4 months old. All the signs show he's ready, so why wait?

20090304153931AAlhOL6	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Pregnant? Flu-like symptomes?	Okay, so this is probably a really dumb question and me just being overly-paranoid. Here's the story.   My bf and I had unprotected sex (he finished inside me) many times about a week and a half ago. (we've been committed for 6 years, so I don't need a lecture please). Anyways, I'm on the pill. I'm waiting for my period to come (should come in about two days), but I am feeling really nauseas and achy. Basically feels like I have the flu. Heartburn, nausea, aches.   My question is, could flu-like syptomes possibly be an indication of pregancy? Has anybody experienced this before?   Thanks.   :)

20090304153859AAyR8qW	Pregnancy & Parenting;Grade-Schooler	Dilemma sending my child to middle school?	My son starts middle school in the fall and we need to register for school. There is a school that is about a 5 minute walk from our house. None of his friends are going to that school. His friends are going to a school far enough away that he would need to take a bus every day or we would have to pay for a school bus transfer that would cost about $500 per school year.   If this was your child what would you do? Pay the money and let him be with his friends or use common sense and send him to the closest school?   Part of me wants him to be with his friends but I know he'll make new ones, and also ones that live close to us that he probably never even knew about.   HELP!

20090304153811AA1hO4X	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Is it okay if baby doesn't like any meat?	my 10 month old daughter doesn't like any meat (beef, chicken, pork).   she's still on puree veggetable and fruit only, she hates texture.   We've been trying to give her meat about a month and texture since she was 8 month.   Anytime we give this to her, she would gag with resulting vomitting.   I'm afraid she will not get benefit of the protein and iron, because she basically what we call vegetarian baby.   and anyone here could suggest what we could give her for protein and iron? beside formula, cereal?   And protein as well, since her ped told me, not egg till 18 month (new guideline).   She doesn't like cheese but eat a bit of yogurt (yobaby, only 1/2 perserving).   Thanks!
20090304153522AANtmDd	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	I desperately need an answer to this! :'(?	My boyfriend of a year and I have unprotected sex all the time, and he always finishes in me. I've been on birth control the whole relationship, and this is the way we've always been, and i've never gotten pregnant. I lost my last months birth control, and my boyfriend knew this, and stupidly we had almost everyday unprotected anyways. My period was due about a week and a half, to two weeks ago. I took a pregnancy test, the ones you can take 5 days before your missed period about 5 days ago, and the results said i'm not pergnant, so what could be going on? I've always thought I was going to be one of those women who's bodies isnt able to have kids, because ive always had unprotected sex with every partner, and i almost always forget to take my birth control, but still i've never gotten pregnant. And i don't excersize constantly, so i know im not not getting my period because of that. could the test have been wrong? should i be noticing any signs by now if im pregnant?
