High mega pixel settings take longer to process and may not be needed unless required for very large pictures.  Maximum print size for a 3 mega pixel setting is 8 x 10 inches.

Canon offers the WC-DC52 0.7x wide-angle lens, the TC-DC52A telephoto lens, the 250D 52mm closeup lens separately, along with the LA-DC52G adapter to mount them on the camera. (Note that the wide, tele, and macro lenses all need the LA-DC52G adapter to mount them to the camera. The lenses won't work by themselves.)  <br>   <br>  There is no one place to get great buys, but click the second link in the information above then search for your camera of choice at the upper left.  Camera prices at this link change often.<br>   <br>  What gives a camera its picture quality?  <br>  It is mostly the skill of the photographer that produces high quality pictures. The lens and camera are very important, but the ability to set the scene, adjust the cameras settings, and hold the camera very still or use a tripod with auto or remote shutter actuation when required is what gets the great pictures.  Megapixel resolution is about potential photo size, not picture quality.<br>   <br>  There are so many cameras out there it is difficult to say which is best, but the second source link will be very helpful as it list most of the cameras out there with prices.

Higher mAh batteries (about one year old) still work well in flashlights, but won't start my camera.<br>   <br>  CAUTION   Do not overcharge!  Batteries can be damaged.

e699280ba62228273204ca88faa3bc10aa	General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) is a mobile data service available to users of GSM mobile phones. It is often described as "2.5G", that is, a technology between the second (2G) and third (3G) generations of mobile telephony. It provides moderate speed data transfer, by using unused TDMA channels in the GSM network. Originally there was some thought to extend GPRS to cover other standards, but instead those networks are being converted to use the GSM standard, so that is the only kind of network where GPRS is in use. GPRS is integrated into GSM standards releases starting with Release 97 and onwards. First it was standardized by ETSI but now that effort has been handed onto the 3GPP.|`|5dd48df95bd68447ae1be5ff0417d737aa	It stands for General Packet Radio Service, its a communicatiosn protocol that was introduced to bridge the gap between old GSM and new CDMA standards...<br>  <br>  Its based on Time Division multiplexing, which allows users to access the entire bandwidth of a channel at the time it needs to transmit. Thus it is packet based transmission since the data is transmitted in bursts rather than at one go. This means more users can occupy the same bandwidth, which makes it more efficient than normal GSM.|`|1c3656e3f504ae803a2df99351232e7caa	General Packet Radio service<br>  <a href="http://www.mobilein.com/GPRS.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.mobilein.com/GPRS.pdf</a>

Otherwise, if it still doesn't work, you have to get a new phone.|`|mHWg8CO9aa	If it does not work, it is because the liquid dmg from dropping it into water has literally fried the board in the phone. You will not be able to use it unless you try to dry it out, however, that doesn't always work. DO NOT take the phone apart, because it will void any insurance warr if you got it. <br>  So now the question is, did you buy insurance on your phone? If so, contact your service provider and get the insurance phone number. Or, if you have Asurion Insurance, you can dial 1 (888) 881-2622 to make a claim. There is always going to be a deductible, which is usually $50. <br>  <br>  If you do NOT have insurance, you have voided the warranty on your phone and will have to pay the full retail price to replace it.

381e3207230460fe8521d523304a91a6aa	Depends on what you want to add to the PSP.  If you plan on adding a lot of songs, then you'll probably need a bigger size memory card.  If you plan on viewing a lot of photos, then you'll need a bigger size one.  But if all you're going to use it for is to save games, then you'll be find with the 1 gb.  I have a 1 gb, but all I use it for is to save games.|`|b54a2cb9535d4ff522bf752b6fcd8723aa	No, I suggest that you take it back! I suggest a 24mb memory stick which you can easily add more memory to by doing some modifications to it. 24mb is the recommended size, and do a google search, you'll know what I mean! My friend used a 1gb for his PSP and wasnt able to use it, because the PSP couldnt work with such a memory stick. So he sent the 1 Gb memory stick back to the store and only got like 30% of what he paid for because he had opened the memory stick box! <br>  <br>  :O|`|726b3625c08ca0ab6a477a98caf61b68aa	that is a pretty good size memory stick.

YveHrC8Laa	If I am reading that currency symbol right, that is GBP, or United Kingdom pounds. And if it is GBP, then no, it is not a good buy. I wonder if the first answer knew what they were saying, because as of this day, 25 pounds = $49. 50 dollars for a DS is never a good buy. I paid $34 for mine, and that was at release. Price must have gone down in the US by now...<br>  <br>  So, to answer again, no it is not a good buy. Remember, I said not a good buy, as in with that price. The game is awesome, I've played for hours and hours, Legendary Hunter rank and it never gets old (to me). I suggest you try and find a cheaper one if you can, otherwise if you can afford the money then go ahead. But I really think $50 for a DS is not a good deal...|`|peZa0jDVaa	Definitely. It's the best portable game I've ever played, and I've played quite a few.
wO7D7EuDaa	well unfortunately its almost impossible to take shots at night without a tripod....reason being that the shutter has to stay open to allow enough light in to take the picture which any little shake or anything will blur the picture because its moving while the shutter is open! with that being said if you still want to try look for models with an "image stabalizer" using that if you have a steady enough hand you may be able to do ok! GOOD LUCK!|`|6489dd6288438d0ac1d6bd81b79f0d8daa	Yes, the Fujifilm F30 is the BEST compact for low-light shooting...both indoors and outdoors in low light (handheld, no flash) because it has the ability to use a high ISO (800-1600), where many other compact cameras will struggle to produce noise free photos at about ISO 200-400. Though, using a tripod would still be best in some situations.<br>  <br>  The only area the F30 can sometimes struggle in, is outdoors in very bright, high contrast lighting.<br>  <br>  So, the F30 is the best compact for low light shooting (it's not perfect), but hey...non perfection is good enough.<br>  <br>  Also look at the F31 fd, which is an update with face detection technology.|`|afcc9ed252cb82444b5889bef318a742aa	I have heard that the Sonys do not perform well in low light.  A friend of mines recently traded his Sony for a new Canon Powershot and he is quite happy with the low-light pictures he's taken.<br>  <br>  Not having a tripod will put you at a disadvantage, as night shots require a slower shutter speed.  If you are going to be taking lots of pictures at night, I'd consider using a tripod.  I might also look into a DSLR and a very fast lens (f2.8, etc.), as the DSLRs have a larger sensor area giving it the ability to produce images in low light with less noise (given a sufficiently "fast" lens").

You would have to download the specific song.|`|b17852e0defdc45d1ce823556913ec97aa	i sort of get the question, and if you've tried everything else, I guess you could try manually putting all of the videos in your trash, then burning it, and putting the videos back. just try putting one in first and taking it back. it will not dissappear in the trash unless you empty it.|`|5jyoVVSeaa	Make a new playlist and just put the songs on it.

It seems that more and more people are having problems with their PS3 nowadays.<br>  <br>  Anyway, make sure your discs are scratch free and smudge free.

82c09456498d17b7fdcbd55444c0d086aa	You want to turn off Wi-Fi, the notorious battery drainer. Turning off Location services also helps, as this will save the juice that is redirected to power the GPS unit. Also, you may want to reduce the brightness of the screen, this will make the battery last a lot longer than it does.<br>  <br>  Hope that helped!|`|AA12116276	Depends what you're doing with wifi on. If you're not using wifi, i.e. you're just watching videos or listening to music that is on your iPod Touch, then you should just turn wifi off and keep the screen black (i.e. press the sleep button) as much as possible...then your battery will last over 24 hours when playing music (not sure how long with vids). If you're using wifi for applications...some applications kill the battery quicker than others. I mainly use music applications, and my battery might get to about 3 hours before the 20% warning starts coming on. There's not much you can do about this except use the applications with your iPod Touch charging at the same time, i.e. hooked into your computer or a wall charger. The advertised amount of battery life is usually not applicable to applications, but mainly to the music and video files on the iPod Touch.|`|WOIgrx6Xaa	turn off wifi if you don't use it or buy an external battery for your ipod. check out the source

YBYnZlP8aa	I often record cell phone calls and conversations related to my business. These are typically witness interviews dealing with an insurance loss. Both parties are aware of the recording. I have found phone voice recordings to be much more useful than a written statement.<br>  <br>  You will need a device to record the phone calls. The Olympus TP7 Telephone Recording Device has been getting good reviews at various websites. <br>  <br>  The device works by inserting the earpiece into your ear prior to beginning the call. You then plug the male adapter into your tape recorder. Hit record. Then proceed to use your cell phone as you normally would. The microphone in the earpiece picks up the audio from the other parties voice as well as your own voice. <br>  <br>  You could also start the recording process in the middle of a cell phone call if needed. <br>  <br>  This is from an article on eHow - which I authored:  How to Record Cell Phone Calls. Check it out if you like. I also included a link to state by state law on recording. Hope this helps.|`|2535byhvaa	just put the phone on speaker and open your windows sound recorder and put it nest to the microphone ;]<br>  i always do that lol.

AA11480891	Check to make sure your computer has the minimum requirements. Then make sure you had adminstrator rights on the computer. You should have recieved an error code when it wouldn't download.
dVs286UOaa	It really doesn't matter which one you buy. You should buy which ever one you can get a service or replacement plan on. I replaced my last mp3 player (I paid 400 dollars for!) with the Zen Vision:M and I love it(just make sure you download the support services from creativelabs.com)! The player I had before was one of the first players with the video functions (RCA Lyra), you could even hook it up to the tv and record shows. But I bought it refurbished and it didn't come with a warranty so in a year and a half when it broke, I was SOL. So needless to say I got the replacement plan with the vision. It's for 2 years so I figured it will at least cover the battery, and those don't last forever, especially since it is a video player. If you have anymore questions, feel free to let me know.|`|U2bDtSe6aa	I bought a refurbished car stereo. It works just like it should. I saved about 25% as well. Buying refurbished means the company got an item back and did a lot of testing on it before sending it out again. It should be fixed and double checked. If it is a decent savings I think you should get a refurbished unit.

V94HSoz0aa	Hmmmm. That question could be about three possible technologies<br>  <br>  First, if you are refering to one of those mirror kits you bracket your tv in to project an image my answer would have to be no. my advise would be to move on to the next possibility.<br>  <br>  Second, if you are refering to a flat panel set, for LCD I reccomend a Sharp and for Pasma I reccomaend Pioneer, go with their industrial/profesional version rather than their Elite line. you will save a good amount of money and get essentialy the same set.<br>  <br>  Last (and in my opinion Best) The new DLP/LCD or LED projectors on the market today. These have finaly come down at least a small amount. You can find the led and lcd units in prices ranging from $800.00 all the way up to $80,000.00 The same can be said for the DLP units but I would reccomend getting a quality unit from a reputable vendor. Far to many of my clients have come to me with horror stories about that unit they saw on the internet that had a price that looked to good to be true and was.<br>  <br>  Understand that when you get into one of these purchases you will have some continued maintenance. There will be lamps to change and filters to clean. there will also be repairs down the line that can carry a fairly hefty price tag in their own right. In short buy the exteded service contract.<br>  <br>  Screens are a story for another question.|`|Uhy1RYLBaa	no because you could buy a 32 inch flat screen tv at walmart for $657

AA12116276	If you ordered it from the Apple site and it is shipped in 24 hours, when you get it will depend on a few things. For one, the weekend is coming--that makes it take a little longer to get stuff since some postal carriers don't move packages on the weekend. We will assume your player did ship today--usually when sites say they ship within 24 hours, they're being honest. <br>  <br>  Another issue is whether Apple ships stuff priority mail, standard mail, etc. It should say on the website. I would guess they ship standard mail, which means you will probably get the iPod by next Friday. If they shipped priority or you otherwise paid for expedited shipping, you would get it around Tuesday or Wednesday. <br>  <br>  Time of the day totally depends on location (both what city you live in and what area of the city you live in) as well as which carrier is delivering the package, so you can't go off what anyone else says. You ought to be able to assess what times it might come by what times you normally get packages from certain carriers, i.e. I know that lately when I order something sent by UPS it comes late in the day, like, after 5pm...and when something comes standard USPS mail it comes around 3:30-4pm. Like I said, that's just my location.|`|RV3oeESvaa	just wait until 24hrrs pass then if it doesnt arrived call the websites number|`|twHXC9Draa	then it takes 24 hours!
EfejPjIMaa	All HDMI cables are the same, just like composite cables (red, white, yellow), component cables (red, blue, green, and red, white), optical cables, and coaxial cables.  Some are gold plated, which gives a better constant signal, but you won't notice that difference unless you have a $10,000 entertainment system.  <br>  <br>  The main difference between a low end HDMI cable and a high end HDMI cable is that the high end cables are better shielded against other electronic interference.  I have both a $150 Monster HDMI cable and a generic Wal-Mart $15 HDMI cable, and I could tell no difference between the two.  Of course I have my PS3 hooked up with the high end cable in my home, and use the cheap HDMI cable when I take my PS3 away from home.  <br>  <br>  While you will pay more for the PS3 specific HDMI cable, it is not necessarily a scam.  It is meant to provide the best signal at 60HZ and shield against other electrical interference that may occur.<br>  <br>  Again, unless you have a high end entertainment center, you will not notice a difference.|`|saMSquNEaa	yes you can only use a specific one because each game is updated to a new disk type and has different signals that need to be read<br>  <br>  hope this helps|`|rRtmC2rpaa	NO its a scam I got inexpensive cables since it is a digital signal either you get a signal or you dont it doesn't matter how much the cable is they all work the same digital audio and video in one cable !!!<br>  <br>  And my PS3 looks great =]|`|HKFL7zxyaa	There's a Ps3 specific HD (not HDMI) component cables, but otherwise, there's no such thing as any "special" HDMI cables. Use any old normal one.|`|Mboh3eVCaa	You can use any HDMI cable you'd like.  And just get the cheapest one available, there's really no difference between one that costs $20 and one that costs $100.|`|QoWi0hzWaa	Anyone will do the job but u might see some differnce in how long is lasts and the picture betwin a cheap one and a expenicive one
ZFuiy3Tsaa	You can't sync your Zune using Windows Media Player unless you use a hack. Even then, when you transfer them to the new computer they will not go automatically into the WMP on it unless it is monitoring whatever folder the Zune puts that music in. It would be a lot easier if you put that music on an external hard drive and move that drive between computers as needed. If the songs are DRM protected Zune won't add them unless the DRM is stripped.

tHjBr4L4aa	I'm having the same dilemma.  Ever since I got my Nikon 50mm f/1.8, I've loved the ability to use lower ISO when shooting non-flash photos.  My 50mm was a lifesaver last week when I was taking some friends to local museums, where flash is often forbidden.<br>  <br>  But, I found myself backing up often and wishing I could have backed up more.  The 50mm gave a 75mm view on my D200 and left me wishing for a wider view.  Switching to my 18-200mm VR helped, but I lost the faster aperture and was shooting at extremely slow shutterspeeds.<br>  <br>  On your D80, the 35mm will give you a 53mm angle of view.  It's not a true wide-angle, but it's a change from what your 50mm gives you.  And, the price is very reasonble.<br>  <br>  Now, if only Nikon made an inexpensive 24mm 1.8....|`|j5Apt8hWaa	Only you can know.<br>  <br>  There is a reason to have both.  The 50 mm is a portrait lens, the 35 mm is a "normal lens"<br>  <br>  Since I rarely used my "normal" lens when I shot 35 mm SLR's I will not be buying the 35 mm for my APS-C sensored cameras.<br>  <br>  If the 35 mm was being used on a full frame or 35 mm SLR, then indeed you would be able to get  more in the shot, but on a DSLR, APS-C camera is will not give you the same angle of coverage.<br>  <br>  So shoot groups, you will want a much wider lens .. more like the 18 or 20 mm lens to allow you to shoot groups.

But its an alternative none the less.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps!|`|AA11539218	you can't use itunes for this, you need to download a third party application that can take the songs from your ipod and put them on your computer...then you find the files on your computer and import them into itunes.<br>  <br>  just search google for "ipod to PC transfer"  Some are free and some are shareware.|`|oxGVEbisaa	Transfer iPod/iPhone/iTouch apps to computer or recover lost or missing music, backup and restore all of iPod/iPhone/iTouch content I recommend you Cucusoft iPhone/iTouch/iPod to Computer Transfer.

4Pk6VNftaa	Sony definitely needs to drop the price on the PS3.  In the past, you could at least point to the PS3 as being one of the best low-priced blu-ray players on the market, since other models were at least $600 or $1000.  However, we're now seeing players coming out at $250 and even $200, which have the same features as the PS3, like HDMI 1.3a and support the latest blu-ray profile spec.<br>  <br>  On the game front, its library certainly lags behind the 360's, and its graphics are nearly identical, making it more expensive for no good reason.<br>  <br>  Last year, Sony didn't drop the price on the PS3.  They simply increased the size of the hard drive in each unit, but kept those prices the same.  Sony can't get away with that this year.  They need to drop their price, or risk falling even further behind the 360 and Wii.<br>  <br>  There are a lot of strong rumors going around that Sony is on the verge of announcing a price drop within the next few months.  Only time will tell what Sony's plans are.|`|pl2SocVKaa	yeah they need to drop the price and that will change the whole console war but we do need blu ray because that sets ps3 apart from the others and makes us more up to date but yeah if we drop down 100$ ps3 sales are gonna skyrocket|`|381e3207230460fe8521d523304a91a6aa	The Blu-ray is what makes the PS3 400 bucks.  It's new technology, and technology aren't cheap.<br>  <br>  To answer your question, yes, the PS3 needs to drop by 100 bucks if it wants to compete with the 360 and Wii.  I think a 300 buck PS3 will sell extremely well.  And with a lot of good games coming out, it can only boost the PS3's sales.|`|wndVpl4baa	Im not even going to answer this you troll , like seriously you like xbox or ps3 better keep it to yourself, no one really cares......|`|i2DHNn3aaa	First your stupid!! Ps3 has a lot of games dumbass, get more informed. Stfu if you want one, wait until sony decides to drop the price.|`|saMSquNEaa	no they wont for a good 5 - 8 months and even thats a mabey because it didnt drop like they said it would for the 160gb|`|HKFL7zxyaa	Sony is already losing a ton of money selling it at $399.  It is a blu-ray player, (it may not have MORE games than 360 YET, but currently has MUCH HIGHER QUALITY ones), has free online, and is basically a computer - it can run Linux. <br>  <br>  Plus, FYI, they are dropping it down to $299 in April for people like you.|`|ZsAnQX4Caa	I really don't care.<br>  <br>  Help beat the World Record: <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Aj8kdUYnvbQ1BQZ1XsX8o7Hty6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090227132706AAEDrZU">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|4gyrvY7Jaa	Blu-ray Players are worth $250 to $400.

4Pk6VNftaa	There are a lot of rumors that Sony will drop the price on the PS3 soon, but so far Sony has said nothing, so these remain rumors.<br>  <br>  Most think Sony will drop the price between March and May.  E3, the big video game trade show, is in June, so it certainly makes sense that they would announce something before then.<br>  <br>  Honestly, I think the chances are very good there will be a price drop this year.  Since you already have a 360, I'd really recommend just waiting for the price drop.  If it doesn't happen this spring, it'll happen in the fall as we start gearing up for the holidays.  Sony cannot afford to have another bad Christmas like they had last year.|`|mb3ooc3uaa	Some guy in Sony denied it, but he also denied it the last time they had a price drop. I didn't check the internet last time they did a price drop, but a lot of sites are saying a price drop will probably happen. A lot say between now and June. A majority say it will happen in April. I could see it happening. They just released Killzone2, wait maybe a month then price cut. I have a 360 as well, I wouldn't buy a PS3 at its current price but $100 less I might.|`|HKFL7zxyaa	There's a price drop coming late April.  Or, you can just sell ur Xbox 360 and use some of that money to help buy a Ps3.|`|QoWi0hzWaa	lmao mybe at christmass time but thats a while away|`|TeQhos22aa	nope it was on qj.net and it said sony said they werent

w4VU7jGbaa	you have to call your wireless service provider for this information.  i think they get that information from the phone manufacturer, so you could also try calling motorola directly.  your friend probably uses a different wireless service provider than you do.  if you use cingular, for example, your sim card will only work in a phone made for cingular.  if you then take your sim card and try to put it in a tmobile phone it will ask for a subsidy password.|`|FyikOA0caa	No, but if you go 2 da company or service provider u should be able to get a new password.|`|ItYbTVIKaa	<a href="http://www.cellphonehacks.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.cellphonehacks.com</a> go here for your answer

Thats because its getting its power source from there.But when you unhook it it dies out?

MaKVb7MHaa	it should not cost anything to send and receive messages on msn and download the messenger just go to www.msn.com on your ipod and sing in. And just search on google for games you can probley get a lot of them for free from diffrent websites.
kDNro0flaa	Well let me tell you this. i highly suggest u look at xbox.com and look at their different qualities of the machines. so far i have not seen any more 20 gig ones because those are the older models. the newly released 60GB have almost a virtually bug free console. it is higly efficient and is one of the best(if you take care of it) Also i agree that a new one is best because the "REFURBISHID" ones are usually horrible and are the older ones. also they only come with a one mothe warranty and the xbox will not repair any refurbished ones. when u buy refurbished ur taking a chance. Any ways yes the console comes with one controller and usually comes with a eternet cable and the power supply, and finally the hd capable av cables. again check the link i posted. One more thing. used games are not very good because they usually contain scratches and this could result in a horrible disc. i once bought one from a store and it had such deep cracks it didnt work on my xbox so i returned it and they said i couldnt because i made the scratches deeper. SO I HOPE I WAS OF ASSISTANCE AND GOOD LUCK MAN|`|AA11510511	Have a look at what 'packages'  the shop 'GAME' has, for your budget.<br>  <br>  What you could do then is ask them of the possibility of changing a couple of the games for games of your choice, or even changing one of the games for a controller|`|wIM3vNtwaa	Doubtful that you'll get all that for ￡190.

IYZxdtFiaa	The UMA (Unlicensed Mobile Access) feature in phones let the subscriber access voice and data services over WLAN, which not only increases availability but reduces operational costs dramatically.<br>  <br>  In order to find out about the data plan, you need to call your service provider.

d6vRZpIdaa	The BlackJack versus the enV2... hmmm, it all depends on what you like. the enV2 is much better than the original version. the buttons are big, the screen also. the Camera is also more compact. including the dual keypad, it is over all very luxurious. The BlackJack is also a very nice cellular device. the screen is very large, and the keypad is also very nice. Also, the click wheel is quite useful. <br>  On the other hand, both of them have their flaws. The enV2's front screen is extremely small, high resolution, but limited. The BlackJack is nice, but the click wheel sometimes does not cooperate. And also, the buttons are raised and small, making texting, well almost hurt. not entirely, and it might be easier to use the sides of your thumbs instead. <br>  Over all, both the BlackJack and the enV2 are excellent phones. In the end, only you can decide. (Personally, i dont like the blackjack, maybe the enV2 more, but if I had to recomend any phone, i would say any BlackBerry device, they are extremely advanced)|`|aojtQwRoaa	Black Jack is WAYYY  betterrrr

Pay and Go (a.k.a Prepay) and monthly subscription (contract). Each have their own billing methods and your answer depends on which one you or the person calling you uses.<br>  <br>  O2 also complicates things by having two main distribution channels, O2 retail and O2 online. They work pretty much independently of one another and so have their own tariffs. It's best to think of them as separate businesses with their own rules, they only share the name O2.<br>  <br>  For pre-pay it can get very complicated as O2 are always coming up new offers on calls, but if we assume none of the offers are taken by either you or the person calling you then the rate be the same (for the moment) whether you are an O2 online customer or O2 retail customer.<br>  <br>  For O2 retail and O2 online pre-pay, the call rate is as follows:<br>  <br>  O2 to O2 and <br>  O2 to landlines (known in the biz as Standard Calls):<br>  <br>  25p per minute for the first 3 minutes of the day. (The day is 12am -11:59pm). So that will be a total of 75p. <br>  <br>  Then the rate goes down to 5p per min for the remainder of the day.<br>  <br>  However, as I say, O2 are always coming up with offers to get you to use your phone and if you take one of them, you can have free minutes per month to make the above calls, or other networks, or reduced rates to other countries, etc.<br>  <br>  For contract customers the rates (again, without any offers taken) are:<br>  <br>  Once your free minutes are used up:<br>  <br>  20p per min to all networks and landlines<br>  12p per text<br>  <br>  For deals and offers on O2, finding the best one can be a job in itself if doing it on your own because both O2 online and O2 retail have some amazing deals and the choices alone can confuse you.<br>  <br>  Be aware though that the above information is only for calls made within the UK.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.<br>  <br>  If you need anymore advice, just send me an email and I'll do my best to answer.

Pretty cool stuff. <br>  <br>  The chocolate I would recommend if you're big on music. It's more of a ipod w/ a phone. So it really depends on what you are planning to use it for mostly besides making calls.|`|5hmEfOW1aa	enV for sure.  If your a texter and emailer like me this will be like HEAVEN!.  Emailing on T9 makes you want you want to pull your hair out.  It really depends what your looking for.   They are both LG phones so they should pick up the same.  I think the new choc would be better if you are doing mp3 and things like that keep in mind the enV has the same features also.  I like that the choc comes in more colors than the enV does. <br>  <br>  Style: new choc.<br>  Performance and Function:enV<br>  <br>  Justin

The green arrow will show up when you send a text. After about 2-4 minutes it will change to a black check meaning they have received the text it Does not mean they have read it. I use to think that it meant that too. LOL. I had to finally test that theory out and text them while they were right next to me. If you're as bad as I am you usually check your sent messages to see if the green arrow has changed to a black check mark to see if they have read the message yet and wonder what was taking so long for them to text  back. And honestly sometimes it just plain doesn't work and never turns into a black check mark even after they have received the message.
ozRI1InWaa	No extra fee. if you want the voyager, you must pay full retail price for it. if you want to pay the "2 year" price, then you will have to renew your contract. the verizon associate will guide you through this process and discuss your options to come to the best decision for you.|`|K9kN68fwaa	<a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/Verizon-LG-Voyager-Guaranteed-in-hand-11-21_W0QQitemZ140177082395QQihZ004QQcategoryZ64355QQssPageNameZWDVWQQrdZ1QQcmdZViewItem" rel="nofollow">http://cgi.ebay.com/Verizon-LG-Voyager-G...</a><br>  You don't renew your contract, all you do is an ESN swap to get the old phone deactivated and the new phone activated. And doing that is free. By paying full retail on the Voyager your contract doesn't change because you not agreeing to another 2 year contract. The two year contract is only for upgrades when eligable and new customers. You will have to upgrade you monthly plan to receive the unlimited internet on the phone. If you wait 2 months before your contract is up then you are eligable for a 2 year contract price that all new Verizon customers get plus a hundred dollars off the phone or you can use that one hundred dollars on another phone. If I were you I would buy the Voyager on Ebay. Paying retail for a phone is crazy. Then when your contract is up you can upgrade your phone again.|`|AA10161745	Sometimes you can call your carrier and ask for the new phone at a discounted price if you agree to extend your contract. You still have one year, so they might not help you right off the bat. The key, however, is persistance. You can keep calling them until you get the answer you want. My experience with big company customer service, the more you ask, the more likely you are to get the answer you want. <br>  <br>  The alternative to this is to just go out and pay retail for the phone you want.|`|f29t3hD9aa	The Voyager is new so you're not going to get one cheaper than $425 (so far that I can see on Ebay) unless you're willing to extend your contract with Verizon just so you can pay $299 for it.  You can try to wait it out until your upgrade is available (not the "New every 2" but the yearly one) which gives you a decently discounted price.  Maybe if you wait a week or two somebody out there is bound to not like the phone after using it and decide to sell it for $400 on Ebay...it's not going to be cheap for a very long time (unless someone drops it a million times, scratches it up like crazy, and is barely functional anymore, you can probably get it for $200!)  Haha just kidding...seriously you will have to pay full price with Verizon or on Ebay...it's a new phone the price isn't going to drop for a while.  That's why I'm waiting till next year =o)  When it drops to $200, eventually...I'm not an eager person so I can wait.  Dunno about you though...

grz5hQzPaa	it gould be a problem with the cord. you know the wireless is working, so I wouldn't think its the internet or gateway. Might just need a new ethernet cable, much cheaper than going to wireless for the 360. Also, keep your receipt if you do get the cable and it still doesn't work, you could probably return it.|`|36Ya7X66aa	Most people with 360 use the stuff that make them go Wireless

mqteL8RWaa	Since (currently) the 18-200mm lenses are designed for 1.6x crop bodies, they don't work on Canon Full frame cameras like the 5D, 1Ds series, and 1D series of cameras.  A third party 18-200mm lenses may mount on the camera and not interfere with the mirror (unlike the EF-S lenses), but they will severely vignette.<br>  <br>  Taking into consideration the 1.6 factor, that lens gives an equivalent view of 28.8-320mm.  The closest lens Canon makes to that is the EF 28-300mm f/3.5-5.6L IS USM.  The USA Version of that lens is about $2300.  For that price, you can get a 50D with the EF-S 18-200mm lens and still have about $200 left over.  There is also the Tamron AF28-300mm F/3.5-6.3 XR Di VC (Vibration Compensation) LD Aspherical (IF) Macro lens.  It's much cheaper than the Canon, but I'm not familiar with its image quality.<br>  <br>  Ok, I see there is a second part of the question that hasn't been answered yet.  What is full frame?  Full frame just means that the sensor is the same size as a 35mm negative,  36x24mm.  You won't get the magnification/crop factor on this camera, so the lenses will be used to their maximum potential.  This image, compares different sensor sizes.<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:SensorSizes.png" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Senso...</a><br>  <br>  The larger the sensor, the more accurate its sensitivity to light is.  The most popular way to put it is, noise levels will be lower at high ISO values, compared to cameras with smaller sensors.|`|Ao3Fl3iSaa	make sure it's an "EF" Lens and NOT "EF-S"|`|6644da85d010d98c8e75bdddc3c55c49aa	If you are planning to get that camera, it's assumed that you should be able to afford good lenses for it. <br>  <br>  Good combination would be (if you want to go from that wide to telephoto), the 16-35 mm f 2.8, the 24-70 mm f 2.8 and the 70-200 f 4. <br>  <br>  Tamron makes a full frame lens with that range you mentioned.

yxR42qX8aa	There's no need to use Ableton's built in synths or samplers (if Live Lite even has any). If you upgrade to the full version of Live (something you'll definitely want to do if you get into using it) the included instruments would certainly be worth using, but there's nothing you can't achieve with a few good VST instruments. <br>  <br>  VST is a plugin format that works in most DAWs. There's a VST folder in Live's browser (the little plug icon) that you set up in preferences on the file/folder tab.<br>  <br>  VST instruments cost anywhere from nothing to hundreds of dollars, and will either take the form of a sample player (sampled sounds), synthesizer (generated sounds), or some combination of the two.<br>  <br>  Here the websites of a few free VSTi developers:<br>  <a href="http://www.bostreammail.net/ers/vstplugins.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.bostreammail.net/ers/vstplugi...</a><br>  <a href="http://northernbeat.com/nb-audio" rel="nofollow">http://northernbeat.com/nb-audio</a><br>  <a href="http://delamancha.co.uk" rel="nofollow">http://delamancha.co.uk</a><br>  <a href="http://dskmusic.com" rel="nofollow">http://dskmusic.com</a><br>  <a href="http://audjoo.com/Helix.html" rel="nofollow">http://audjoo.com/Helix.html</a><br>  <a href="http://stillwellaudio.com/?page_id=37" rel="nofollow">http://stillwellaudio.com/?page_id=37</a><br>  <a href="http://kunz.corrupt.ch/?Products" rel="nofollow">http://kunz.corrupt.ch/?Products</a><br>  <a href="http://gtgsynths.com/plugins.htm" rel="nofollow">http://gtgsynths.com/plugins.htm</a><br>  <a href="http://e-phonic.com/plugins" rel="nofollow">http://e-phonic.com/plugins</a><br>  <a href="http://jeremyevers.com/atlantis" rel="nofollow">http://jeremyevers.com/atlantis</a><br>  <a href="http://tweakbench.com" rel="nofollow">http://tweakbench.com</a><br>  <a href="http://amvst.com" rel="nofollow">http://amvst.com</a><br>  <a href="http://minisoftmusik.de" rel="nofollow">http://minisoftmusik.de</a><br>  <a href="http://xoxos.net" rel="nofollow">http://xoxos.net</a><br>  <a href="http://odosynths.com" rel="nofollow">http://odosynths.com</a><br>  <a href="http://bserrano.free.fr/Synths.html" rel="nofollow">http://bserrano.free.fr/Synths.html</a><br>  <a href="http://hgf-synthesizer.de" rel="nofollow">http://hgf-synthesizer.de</a><br>  <a href="http://ugoaudio.com" rel="nofollow">http://ugoaudio.com</a><br>  <a href="http://antti.smartelectronix.com" rel="nofollow">http://antti.smartelectronix.com</a><br>  <a href="http://neotec.argle.de/cetone" rel="nofollow">http://neotec.argle.de/cetone</a><br>  <a href="http://easytoolz.de" rel="nofollow">http://easytoolz.de</a><br>  <a href="http://marvinpavilion.ojaru.jp/vst.html" rel="nofollow">http://marvinpavilion.ojaru.jp/vst.html</a><br>  <a href="http://krakli.wordpress.com/krakli-free-synths" rel="nofollow">http://krakli.wordpress.com/krakli-free-...</a><br>  <a href="http://blu-gruv.tripod.com" rel="nofollow">http://blu-gruv.tripod.com</a><br>  <a href="http://sohasound.com" rel="nofollow">http://sohasound.com</a><br>  <br>  And if you want to spend some money:<br>  <a href="http://u-he.com" rel="nofollow">http://u-he.com</a><br>  <a href="http://vemberaudio.se" rel="nofollow">http://vemberaudio.se</a><br>  <a href="http://fabfilter.com" rel="nofollow">http://fabfilter.com</a><br>  <a href="http://applied-acoustics.com" rel="nofollow">http://applied-acoustics.com</a><br>  <a href="http://devine-machine.com" rel="nofollow">http://devine-machine.com</a><br>  <a href="http://karmafx.net" rel="nofollow">http://karmafx.net</a><br>  <a href="http://tone2.com" rel="nofollow">http://tone2.com</a><br>  <a href="http://virsyn.de" rel="nofollow">http://virsyn.de</a><br>  <a href="http://native-instruments.com" rel="nofollow">http://native-instruments.com</a><br>  <a href="http://cakewalk.com/Products/instruments.asp" rel="nofollow">http://cakewalk.com/Products/instruments...</a><br>  <a href="http://image-line.com" rel="nofollow">http://image-line.com</a><br>  <br>  KVR is a great resource (forum & database) for anything regarding music software:<br>  <a href="http://kvraudio.com/forum" rel="nofollow">http://kvraudio.com/forum</a><br>  <br>  And for answers to any questions regarding Live, use their forum:<br>  <a href="http://ableton.com/forum" rel="nofollow">http://ableton.com/forum</a><br>  <br>  Hope that helps...
hHaiaABPaa	It means that its a problem inside the ipod. The jack that the earphones plug INTO is busted. I would take it to an apple store, or ship it to apple. Don't let them overcharge you for the fix, it's very simple, i could actually do it myself.|`|0iUAdOYPaa	It could be the settings on your iPod,<br>  <br>  Right-Click on a song, The go to "Options" in the Tabs, Change The Volume Adjustments to none.<br>  This Should Help it, If it does fix it but only for that one song, Then go to Edit -> Select All.<br>  & Do The Same Thing Again It Should Work|`|yg5fOYLtaa	More than likely your headphone jack has gone bad. It can be replaced.  If you iPod is still under warranty it would be covered.  If not apple charges $129 to replace it.  Here is a link to another site that does it for about $35.  I think apple's fee is outrageous.  These folks that replaced my sons are much more reasonable!!<br>  <br>  Hope it helped! <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ipodhowtovideo.com/video/videoheadphonereplacement.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ipodhowtovideo.com/video/vide...</a>|`|DjPe4CEDaa	its your ipod female jack thats got a problem fix it to the nearest apple store.. |`|xKUXrdVhaa	i know i had that problem aswell u can not solve this problem there broken u will have to get new 1`s :)|`|2hpxAOLgaa	go to where u bought it at and let the manager fix it|`|my4Y6jPsaa	if its still in warenty,send it back,<br>  |`|BYoRHTV5aa	maybe you aren't plugging it in all of the way? that's what's happened to me before...
t03wLCFkaa	yes but only if the cd player can be connected to the wall|`|ivjHOJ8daa	Any cd player would do this... you could programme it repeat 1 song, a whole album, or repeat the amount of cd's that the cd player takes!<br>  <br>  Hope that helps!<br>  <br>  x|`|NS1IlLqzaa	Yeah! This isn't too hard. Just about any modern CD player will do this. Actually, it should be a cross CD/RADIO/CASSETTE player. Just press mode, until it is on "repeat 1" You could also take a laptop, or desktop, with speakers, and play a song on windows media player, and press CTRL + T<br>  <br>  Just leave it on as long as you need. It sounds to me that you are doing an insanity experiment? XD|`|t2FDjNSiaa	hell yeah, most cd players on the market will do this. as long as you have a current going through your unit, with a cd popped in, it will be on for as long as you can say donkey kong|`|GV2PtWzMaa	yes most cd players have "mode" buttons keep pressing it until you see a symbol kind of like the recycling symbol|`|7TGs5Tkiaa	yes if u look at best buy they have some nice ones|`|wzpMbdTWaa	of course it is possibly most if not all cd players have this option, the best make though is SONY get them for great sound quality in fact you don't even need a cd player you can use itunes it have a repeat button it looks like a two arrows going around and around should be the same on a cd player.|`|nNY56LYFaa	you need a stereo with a headphone jack. sorry that's the only thing you can use. or u can use an i pod plugged into a charger (i wouldn't recommend it its bad for the i pod).|`|7F95LFPSaa	 Yes it is Possible there will easy to find. you should try wal-mart if not there you should try radio shack or best buy there are good places to look<br>  <br>    well hope that experiment works <br>  ttyl|`|Dlf5MM4caa	Almost if not every CD player has the option to repeat tracks, I think any CD player would suit your needs.|`|V2pTyZlUaa	Get an iPod ding ding.|`|aCP96GQFaa	yeay eayea

1yov0JF9aa	did they give you the correct area code?<br>  <br>  if you are using a VOIP service, there may be an error in the route mapping.|`|otir4W0caa	As you confirmed with the other person that the number is correct, and it works when dialed by them, then I would suggest that it is only one of two possibilities:<br>  1.  Your fax machine has a dialing problem.  Confirm the problem by testing with a regular telephone or another fax machine.<br>  2.  Your telephone long distance carrier has a Call Routing problem.  In which case, you will have to contact your telephone provider customer support or repair department and have them look into the long distance call routing problem.
CSdCS8xZaa	If the cord was supposed to be supplied go to your supplier and request they give one.<br>  Other than that most USB cables are from a set of about 7, though there are exceptions. You could go to any normal computer store or fair and ask around. If it fits it should usually be fine.
nf7v3xdjaa	It looks like a Polaroid Spectra 1200i Instant Camera.

Kxb8WGgMaa	It depends on what she likes:<br>  <br>  DS - Portable, loads of fun games. Personal, so you can personalise your ds. Great for connecting. Plays gameboy games. Comes in many colours (red, green, blue, dark blue, black, white, pink, silver). Small and easy to carry. No wires (unless charging). Cheaper than a Wii<br>  <br>  WII - Excellent family fun. Many, many games. Lots of differnt types of game (family, horror, brain training, sporty, cute games) and for different ages. Four people can play at one time (depending on which game you have). Plays gamecube games. Allows an SD card to be put in it. And much more!<br>  <br>  Overall, I would say DS because I get bored of my Wii after a while, and the games are generally cheaper! :)<br>  |`|meNI6vuyaa	Wii No doubt|`|ncCWnApDaa	Overall I prefer the wii though the DS is far better for RPG's right now, but for most everything else I say the wii is better.|`|mGzwEvQbaa	Yeesh.... tough one.<br>  <br>  Sure, the wii is an awesome home system, but the DS has been the #1 selling portable for a while now, and the games library is HUGE!  Lot's of em are really good, and exclusive to the DS.<br>  <br>  Me?  I'd go for the wii, just because I like the big TV.|`|wm4R4q3zaa	the wii is really good!! but its a gaming system and isnt really movable<br>  <br>  the DS is more portable and is still good;; its more for the little people though|`|TiW72sAUaa	i cannot vouch for DS but the Wii is excellent|`|AA11015890	DS!  I love it!  It comes everywhere with me because I'm very sad.|`|jnXL6qJIaa	with the wii you have to buy all the different remotes to play the games, and that becomes really, really expensive! and the graphics are a bit pants on the wii also, but the nintendo ds is better in my opinion, as you can take it anywhere, and you can link up with friends and play, and it will let you send messages to your friends also, the graphics are good and the games are much cheaper. hope it helps.|`|IxSweNDoaa	Errr...well they are two completely different things.  DS is a handheld, portable console whereas the Wii is not.<br>  <br>  I prefer the Wii but depending on how old she is may vary.  If she is younger then a DS would be the better option in my opinion.<br>  <br>  Search for games that she might like with it and then see which has the most choice.<br>  <br>  I would hazard at a guess either way at the Nintendo DS.  There is also a new Nintendo DSi coming out soon so perhaps that.|`|9TdhmHFCaa	in my own opinion, i prefer the nintendo ds, it seems to be more personal and mobile... so it would be good if that's the sort of thing you want<br>  <br>  the NINTENDO wii requires more movement... but i find the games are easier to cheat on <br>  <br>  =]|`|nbxpd5UXaa	wii, wii, wii, wii oh yea wii!!!<br>  Answer mine please, anybody!!!<br>  <a href="http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AmYnvkh9OPo2RggrtoQ42I0gBgx.;_ylv=3?qid=20081014121605AAVyLYi">http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>|`|saMSquNEaa	it depends on if u travel and if like drawing if not get a wii personally i would say wii if u travel ad love drawing and tapping get a DS|`|j0EYVZbnaa	I have both and the Wii is better.

I prefer the ds personally.|`|zf559rY3aa	The DS is a ton of fun, but I would go for the Wii. It is always in high demand, and Nintendo is currently in the process of making a new DS, so I wouldn't buy one until the new version comes out. |`|wEMiQ57saa	i dunno cause the ds can have like loads of puzzles using the stylus but u can loose weight on the wii<br>  also u cant really put them on contest 1's handheld and 1's console<br>  <br>  |`|587moE9qaa	depends if she wants a bit of fitness as well as fun i would go for wii but if just fun a ds. there seems to be more games for ds|`|ivBlct6kaa	the wii, but its gonna get boring after about 1 month|`|0w7UttHFaa	nintendo nes cannot be touched|`|AA10890051	wii|`|TW3mYvndaa	i'd say wii, but the ds is pretty fun too.<br>  <br>  i think youd get more out of a wii.. although it does cost more..<br>  |`|XDEO1EYZaa	the wii is so much fun! i would get that!|`|BEfdlMoPaa	wii of course|`|4e70613829a7b6d7f0627c5b421c5a49aa	both are good

But, if you want to transfer files from your PC to you PS3, you can save them onto a USB flash drive and transfer them that way... that's how I did it.  It's pretty easy and quick.  |`|dCuWCbRkaa	Hmmm I'm not sure why not.  I don't have a PS3 yet, but let me try to diagnose this.  I know that on my PSP there are certain sites that have a ton of memory on them, so it's harder for them to load.  So for Windows Messenger and Hotmail, I go to mobile.msn.com.  It works great for things like that when you can live with a simple yet still functional page.|`|AA10890051	yes
nQ7G1nBVaa	The remote should have come with documentation. If it never did, get it from your provider, or see if you can find a copy on the web.
SDcYxvD8aa	Tested on my Wii version<br>  Your code is correct, Blue, Blue, Red, Green, Green, Blue, Blue, Yellow<br>  <br>  Then you need to find 'Quickplay' in the cheat list (scroll down) and enable it|`|ROsPvxTIaa	Wouldn't it be funner just to unlock those songs yourself?
DZtlgGOkaa	If you have a camcorder just use that, but if not use a game recorder. They usually cost $30-40.|`|AA10146029	i wouldnt recommend using hypercam. i would recommend getting an actual game recorder, such as fraps. its like 40$ but go on youtube and say fraps for free and you can get it for free. only downside to fraps is that the encoding is uses causes the video sizes to be really large.
X4LcP1Zjaa	Either download it by a slower range (etc. 1x) <br>  I know there's a software that gives you that option but I forgot the name. Lol sorry. Or maybe buy a better CD 'cause I know some cds work very with different PS2 models. Or it's the game itself 'cause the game <br>  data is obviously large. If none of those work then if necessary,<br>  download another ISO of the game.|`|0AUTZt5Aaa	Buy the real game.|`|Xt31HyvWaa	You need to have a 4x dvdr disc for this to work.
XPmlDwNHaa	ok there is two things you need to check, first the amount of people you can make. if the maximum of people to trained had been met, then you cannot train more until some one dies or you get an upgrade to train more people than usual. you can know if you reach the maximum at the top right screen, i believe it show the number of people you have. Also the tank requires more than 1 person to train. SECOND about the tank not moving, it depends on the tank, there is a tank that station itself in the floor without moving so you need first to command it to disable it, then you can move it where you want. by the way, the scorpion DOES NOT do this, it is a different tank.

MGr5lU3Naa	Try taking it to a local gamestop store. I am sure they could give you an estimate on how much iit wouldbe to repair it. Gamestops are located everywhere, so it shouldnt be too hard to find one. How much it would cost, it would depend on what needed to be fixed. Like if they had to replace the hard drive, it could be 50-60 bucks or more or less, it just depends on what they tell you. One thing to check might be the power cord. If the power cord is broke, nothing will work (happend to me). The second thing would be to clean out the fan in the back with a q-tip. Sometimes dust really builds up in it and can cause it to stop working.

kvog6ICCaa	To burn music onto a CD from iTunes you should just be able to put the songs you want to burn into a playlist then put a cd into your burner and click the button at the bottom of iTunes that says "Burn CD." If you don't have the most recent version of iTunes, that might be what you have to download, I'm not sure about that part. If your problem persists, go into the Apple help & support section of their website, they have tons of problems and fixes for you to read and use.

(Some people won't spend time on it.) If you don't have a DS Lite, I would recommend the DSi completely because DS games are way better than PSP games and it has great features.|`|KBXJeIKtaa	I don't recommend either. Nintendo is taking a bunch of features away to add new ones. There taking away the Game Boy slot, less memory than the lite. And might start making DSi games instead of DS games so save your self some time and buy a PSP.<br>  <br>  I dont reccomend Wii Fit  because the little bratty Wii Balance Board is f***ing racist to fat people!|`|hwaTOBL7aa	Ok Wii Fit actually helps with exercise but it costs $90! You actually lose weight but is $90 worth it to you?<br>  <br>   As for the dsi, it can play music,go on the internet (if you buy that app),take pictures,plays ds games, chat with friends,good graphics,other applications will be released. But the dsi is going to be $180 when released! It's going to be expensive but playing game and whole other features will be worth the money.<br>  <br>  P.S. it costs $25 to pre order the dsi at Game Stop, but the $25 goes towards the dsi purchase, so if you pre order it will cost $155.|`|AZMfQlWmaa	neither both suck<br>  <br>  wii fit has exercises that u can do at home. Like push ups, do u really need a electronic board to help u do push ups..... also there's yoga, yoga is pointless if u want to lose weight doing yoga it will take u months because yoga is all about slow movements and streaching<br>  <br>  balance i have no idea<br>  <br>  arobics idk<br>  <br>  anyways the dsi won't be comming until april and it's just a nintendo psp. they've tooken most of the psp features and upgraded them so much that people don't notic those features are like the psp<br>  <br>  The only good thing about it is the camera..... yea that's about it the camera.<br>  <br>  why would you need bigger screens the screens the ds has right now is perfect. Instead of 1 mic they have 2 wtf??<br>  <br>  now the switch the power button again now it's close to the bottom left hand corner<br>  <br>  The dsi will be longer, also they should;ve had a cover for the camera now the dsi has one big hole in the corner.<br>  <br>  The internet is useless unless u can actually get a signal<br>  <br>  and the completly booted out the GBA slot now how are you going to play gba games, pokemon platinum requires a gba game to catch some pokemons. Guitar hero requires the GBA slot to play guitar hero.<br>  <br>  They also change the charging port again, they could;ve left it the original way but they had to change it because they want to make profit.<br>  <br>  If you want to save ur pictures u need to buy a micro sd card so yea it's a waste of money<br>  <br>  I've also heard that the dsi is like 150-200 bucks|`|lvzZA7ubaa	Wii Fit.|`|49thUAM0aa	wii fit.u can get it now.then that helps u wer out the dsi because that thing is booming.|`|BF0tckS6aa	Yes it's proper exercise.

c1c3f15d1b507986be998c3d578230b9aa	If you are using alkaline batteries or have bad electrical contacts between batteries and camera, that could be the problem. I accidentally had an Adaptive Lighting option turned on and my camera indicated battery low until that option was turned off. The more programs your camera is running, the heaver the load.<br>   <br>  Repair of cameras is more expensive than replacement, but it may help to clean and charge the batteries as described below.<br>   <br>  A friend asked me to clean and charge her new 2000mAh Duracell batteries as described in the next link.  Those batteries are still going strong after four months of normal use and have not been recharged.<br>   <br>  Click this link for other camera tips and complete instructions on cleaning camera and battery electrical contacts. <br>  <a href="http://www.google.com/base/a/4210404/D13701973093918363271" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/base/a/4210404/D13...</a><br>   <br>  Most NiMH rechargeable batteries lose charge and should be recharged when not used after two weeks, but Duracell and RayOVac new formula 2000mAh NiMH batteries hold charge one year when not used.  Also, 2000mAh batteries seem to have a longer life.  Did not like these batteries at first, but have 12 over five years old and all are still as good as new.  Higher mAh batteries (about one year old) still work well in flashlights, but won't start my camera.<br>   <br>  CAUTION   Do not overcharge!  Batteries can be damaged.  Use an automatic two or more hour Energizer Compact smart charger with temperature monitor, trickle charge technology, and safety timer ($9.76) at Walmart.  Use pre-charged 2000mAh Duracell ($12.97) or RayOVac ($5.97) batteries (both hold charge one year) and a full cycle charge.  To preserve battery charge, use the viewfinder.<br>   <br>  This could be the best slim line camera with a viewfinder and ... It's PINK, but it uses a $49.50 Series G Rechargeable 960mAh lithium-ion battery.<br>  <a href="http://shopping.yahoo.com/p:Sony%20Cyber-shot%20DSC-W150%2FR%20Digital%20Camera:1995337750;_ylc=X3oDMTB0bjZzaWNuBF9TAzk2NjMyOTA3BHNlYwNmZWVkBHNsawNlbGVj">http://shopping.yahoo.com/p:Sony%20Cyber...</a> ...<br>  <a href="http://www.digitalcamerareview.com/default.asp?newsID=3462&review=sony+cybershot+w150" rel="nofollow">http://www.digitalcamerareview.com/defau...</a> ...<br>   <br>  <a href="http://www.batteryuniversity.com/parttwo-34.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.batteryuniversity.com/parttwo...</a> ...<br>  This link is about prolonging the life of lithium-based batteries which last from two to three years, but are very expensive. A Sony series G rechargeable 960mAh lithium-ion battery is $49.88 at Walmart.<br>   <br>  If batteries are removed more than a few hours, the date/time setting and other set-up information will be lost. If the camera is being stored for a long time, the batteries should be removed and stored properly.<br>   <br>  Carry and dispose of batteries in baggies, blister packs, or other containers to protect ends from short circuit. Batteries explode when short circuited. NiMH batteries are environmentally friendly and may be discarded with trash.<br>   <br>  Camera reports batteries low, but is it low charge or bad electrical contacts? Overcharging can ruin good batteries!  The secret to making digital cameras work better is having good electrical contacts between batteries and camera.<br>   <br>  Digital cameras require lots of power. Bad electrical contacts can cause lots of problems so battery and camera contacts must be cleaned properly.  Batteries may be fully charged, but camera will indicate "low" if contacts are not really good. The LCD screen is a low steady load, but when lens extension, optical zoom, focus, and flash charging are added in the capture mode; the load is very heavy.  Bad contacts make cameras do strange things like making bad pictures or shutting off with the lens out. <br>   <br>  NiMH batteries should be recharged when camera reports batteries low.  Old batteries can discharge over night, but may provide normal service immediately after being charged.  Battery pairs no longer usable in cameras may work well in flashlights.  Do not drop batteries or allow voltage below one volt.<br>   <br>  CAUTION   To prevent memory card corruption, keep batteries charged, format in camera, and don't delete or fill card completely.  Wait for lights to stop flashing then turn camera off before removing memory.  For card readers, double click Safely Remove Hardware.  Select, then click Stop and OK.<br>   <br>  Never touch battery ends or camera electrical contacts.  Oil from fingers will contaminate contacts.  Use batteries in matched pairs of same brand and rating.  Do not mix old and new batteries.  New will only do as well as old.<br>   <br>  Click source link for other camera tips and complete instructions on cleaning camera and battery electrical contacts.<br>   <br>  Source(s):<br>  <a href="http://www.google.com/base/a/4210404/D13701973093918363271" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/base/a/4210404/D13...</a>|`|cc030d61dc9bcfd7d41ed6138df0d0b1aa	only use rechargeable batteries|`|7fd15463f8f94e660ace0eae8a09fbe3aa	have u tryed to change the batteries cuz that could be the problem or if it is a little button u push maybe u are not pushing hard enough or it is stuck or are you trying to turn it on while it is cold.. i know that sometimes my camera wont turn on either and its usually becasue it is cold or im not pushing down on the botton hard enough
YBQeMdAFaa	it's because ps3 has lower RAM. Yes, the RAM which you put in the computer. It's the same. This is why xbox 360 loads much faster than a ps3, even though ps3 has a slightly better graphics processor.<br>  <br>  well, as mentioned above, you could decrease your hard drive content, or keep your ps3 well ventilated, not hidden away in a stufy closet.

py0DpCh4aa	How much do text messages cost, and is there a way to get unlimited texting? <br>  Texting costs .30 units to send / recieve.  (some phones have free incoming texts, however, and some phones charge a full .50 units to send/recieve)<br>  <br>  No unlimited.<br>  <br>  - The phone he wants just happens to be a tracfone(he just doesn't know) and it says that it has a camera and supports picture mail. Is the pic mail feature an additional cost?<br>  To recieve pictures costs 1.00 units and to send can be up to 3 units.  (it's something like 1 unit to send and an extra .50 for every minute thereafter to send........BUT It depends on the phone he wants, one of them supports FULL bluetooth technology and it's free to transfer PICS)<br>  <br>  <br>  - If you purchase a phone online, how long can you let it sit without activating it? <br>  I'm not sure.<br>  <br>  My gram was thinking of ordering a phone online and having it shipped to our house. She really doesn't want to activate it until June. Can she do that?<br>  Probably.<br>  <br>  She wants to enroll in a monthy plan of $19.99 per month, if she orders the phone and doesn't activate it right away, there's no way that they can charge her monthly until she does activate it, right?<br>  Sounds right.  But IDK how the monthly billing works.<br>  <br>  Thanks-<br>  Isabel<br>  -Does it cost extra to download ringtones?<br>  Yes, up to 30 units I've read.  I paid 7.95 for my first and they wanted to charge me 15.95 for the 2nd one.  <br>  I'm not sure how they charge for ringtones.  (popularity of the song perhaps?)
69bf306804b0f96dabbff07f7be09591aa	The problem is that your iphone is not currently synced with the mac computer, it's synced with the windows one. I think you can by synced with five computers, you have to authorize the other computers to sync with it; however, I have never been able to get that working. I love my iTouch, but in my opinion this whole iTunes/syncing thing is really messed up.|`|AA10332688	An iPhone or iPod cannot be synced to more then one computer.  There is a way to get around it, though.  You must jailbreak it (search Google for "quickpwn" and download the file (it's free) and also go to <a href="http://www.felixbruns.de/iPod/firmware/" rel="nofollow">http://www.felixbruns.de/iPod/firmware/</a> and choose "iPhone1,1..." for the first iPhone or "iPhone1,2..." for the 3G and then download).  Run QuickPwn and choose your iPhone model then choose the firmware you just downloaded.  Let the program do its thing and wait until your iPhone reloads.  Go to the home screen and you should have 2 new apps; Cydia and Installer.  Open Cydia and read the message and then wait until the restart finishes.  Open up Cydia again and ignore the update (you can do that later) and hit search at the bottom right.  Search for "swaptunes" and hit it and install it.  When it is finished let it respring (I'm not sure if it has to but do it if it does).  If it doesn't go to the home screen and an icon for SwapTunes hit it and it will say that it's swapping your library.  When it is finished check your music icon and make sure that it says that there is no music.  If there isn't plug the iPhone into the MAC and sync it.  When it is done that should be the only song in your library on your iPhone.  If you hit SwapTunes again, your old library will reappear but that song will not be in it.<br>  <br>  <br>  Notes:<br>  -***Jailbreaking voids the warranty on your iPhone so be ready to risk it.***<br>  -If SwapTunes is not found when you search for it, you will have to update Cydia.<br>  -Installer can be used but it is a lot more complicated than Cydia.

QC1DxSZdaa	You need the Wii, 2 controllers and 2 nunchucks. the game is a very social one, and if you can afford to get more then do it. I play the PS3 alone, but would never do that with the Wii. The Wii sports game that comes with it is enough for xmas day - great fun, then you can decide afterwards what type of games she likes. <br>  <br>  Play.com is always a great place to get electronic stuff.<br>  <br>  *edit* You don't need a nunchuck for every controller, but you do if you want to play the games that require them. Personally, I have 4 controllers and 4 nunchucks. Although there are games out there that don't need the nunchucks, I think its pointless buying a controller without them. In fact, they may as well sell them together.|`|TiW72sAUaa	Usually with a wii you get one remote and 1 nunchuck, therefore I would buy and additional remote and nunchuck, We have a game which needs two nunchucks and when I played against my son he was shooting hell out of me and I couldnt move.

oEvHzaUPaa	The price of your system will be dictated by whether you're looking for an entire system including dvd, speakers and subwoofer. If you're looking for just the receiver and you already have speakers and a dvd player, you can buy very nice units for that much. If you need the entire system: HTIB (home theater in a box) you're just a little low on budget. Panasonic, Sony, Aiwa and others make some nice units for around $400, but units that are smaller and less expensive will sacrifice sound quality and reliability for price. Other brands such as magnavox, sylvania etc make cheap htib's but you'll need to hear and touch them before you buy. Check pricescan and the like for price comparison's|`|Gx1vXXGPaa	I would recommend the onkyo HT 7100 or the HT 6100 system they have everything you need and excellent sound for a reasonable price. Both are 7.1 systems with full HDMI connectivity and all the latest surround sound decoders. For the money it is the best system you will find for under 1000 bucks.

ohq6qrFaaa	.AAC, or Advanced Audio Codec is the format Apple uses if you rip your CDs in iTunes or download from the iTunes store. Apple converts your files into .AAC if they are incompatible with iPod, such as WMA. If your music is already MP3, DO NOT CONVERT IT! MP3 and AAC are both lossy codecs, which means they remove part of the file in order to get it so small (the parts you can't hear). Converting from one lossy codec to another means the second codec will be removing part of the actual audible sound of the file ending up in a terrible quality file.<br>  <br>  In conclusion, if your music plays alright on your iPod, don't bother ;)

ada38d40b8a478e4e22c3765f3ad91e9aa	Unfortunately, even though the 2 machines are exactly the same, there is no way to get the 2550 firmware onto the 2500. At least none that I know of and I have been researching for some time. <br>  I'm pretty sure that the model number is stored in the firmware chip and if you could figure a way into editing that model number, then you'd be able to get the firmware to update.
xTioPxaVaa	I've got a GNX-4 from Digitech, and I believe the architectures are similar.  <br>  <br>  The Digitech products are optimized for guitar.  I'll tell you right now that the mic preamps leave a lot to be desired.  It would be a total waste to plug a nice mic a Blue Bottle into it.<br>  <br>  In fact, just about anything would be better.  <br>  <br>  If you just need a preamp, then my current favorites for under $500 are from Presonus.  The Presonus Studio Channel has a class A tube preamp, VCA compressor, and 3 band EQ for about $300.<br>  <br>  If you need digital conversion, then the Presonus FireBox has a decent preamp, 24/96 conversion, and can be picked up from American Musical for $250 (and that includes a copy of Cubase LE).<br>  <br>  At the budget end, you can pick up an ART Tube MP preamp with audio out for about $70, or USB out for $100.<br>  <br>  Good luck.<br>  <br>  Greetings from Austin, TX<br>  <br>  Ken

YBQeMdAFaa	well, if you love books a lot, than an ebook reader should be the best option. The apps like 'stanza' are very good on the iphone. Clasics like war and paece are available, and you can change the size of the text to your convenience. However,in my case, I tend to flick the imaginary page about every 10 to 20 seconds, because there are'nt that many words on a single page. It's not the best, but it's quite good. I would stick with the iphone coz i like havin the other apps and music (of course).<br>  instead of goin for a plain e-book reader, you should rather go for a netbook. They're relatively new and every company is launching there own version of a cheap portable laptop. You can even get one of them on contract ...(<a href="http://www.pcpro.co.uk/reviews/231366/dell-inspiron-mini-9.html)" rel="nofollow">http://www.pcpro.co.uk/reviews/231366/de...</a> or this one could be another choice ...(<a href="http://www.pcpro.co.uk/reviews/215688/advent-4211.html).They" rel="nofollow">http://www.pcpro.co.uk/reviews/215688/ad...</a> are not high-end laptops and there are many other ones by companies, mainly such as 'asus' and 'eee', which have made the most famous netbooks.

AA12090277	Here's why I chose a Zune over an iPod:<br>  <br>  1. Nice design - Both are very nice looking, but I think the Zune is better. It's different, yet cool, and the iPod Classic has too much of a utilitarian look to it, and isn't as inviting.<br>  <br>  2. Hardware - Definitely Zune. The brushed aluminum backside is really scratch free (Apple uses the other scratch-prone aluminum back). The plastic front of the Zune has a nice solid texture. The Zune has a BIGGER glass screen. Makes video viewing great. <br>  <br>  3. UI - The user interface on the Zune is much more better and intuitive. The iPod Classic still uses that menu system where you have to keep "digging" in and out to get where you want. Zune one ups it by making it very easy to find what you want in one category, and gets you back to the home screen faster.<br>  <br>  4. Customizability - You can change the background of the menu(easy to identify and looks cool), get your Zune a nickname (you have to register, and hope noone else took it), get special laser engraving at Zune Originals ( <a href="https://zuneoriginals.net/" rel="nofollow">https://zuneoriginals.net/</a> ), cases, accessories, and the usual. <br>  <br>  5. FM Radio - You can catch radio talk shows, news, sports, radio contests, new music, and a bunch of other radio content with the FM Radio. You can also buy a song from a radio station, if there's RDS offered.<br>  <br>  6. WiFi - You can share songs and pictures with other Zune owners, wirelessly connect to your PC, access the Marketplace store, and instantly update your podcasts<br>  <br>  7. Software (computer) - I personally like to manage my music in the Zune software better. iTunes really looks like old spreadsheets compared to the Zune program. Again, the UI on the desktop software is pretty smooth, slick, and simple to go around. Nice transitions, and you can even change the background theme. Also, it uses LESS memory, so it's not as as bad on system resources.<br>  <br>  8. Store - iTunes does have more content, I'll admit. But the offerings on Zune aren't bad. It has almost all the tracks that iTunes has, and there's some TV shows and music videos offered (Increasing every week!). Browsing through Zune Marketplace is cool though! Popular artists have special pages and it looks really neat to browse through. Finding content is much more easier for me. You can also access the store on your device.<br>  <br>  9. Zune Pass - This is an optional way of getting music from the store. Instead of traditionally buying music, you can RENT music for $14.99 a month. You have access to almost all of the store's music tracks, and you can download as many tunes as you want onto your device. After a month, you do have to pay $14.99 to keep your subscription running, or else your songs don't work. But it's a great legal way to get tons of music, for a rather cheap price.If that's not your thing, each song cost 79 points each (99 cents). <br>  <br>  10. MixView - On the Zune software, there's this awesome visualization that comes up when you're playing a song. You really have to take a look : <a href="http://video.msn.com/video.aspx?vid=1dadcc7c-bbed-4e5c-a36a-b6bc44728ed1" rel="nofollow">http://video.msn.com/video.aspx?vid=1dad...</a><br>  <br>  You can DOWNLOAD the Zune software right now, and give it a try : <a href="http://www.zune.net/en-US/products/zunesoftware/default.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.zune.net/en-US/products/zunes...</a><br>  <br>  Also, the Genius feature on the iPod, doesn't even compare to the Zunes. Check out any fair review on the web, and the Zune's Channels and Picks offer a much better music discovery.|`|YK772H0saa	iPod.|`|q2HoLvJyaa	Ipod i think

But anyways, I have the enV2 and I love it so much more than my razor. its slim, you can text with both the keypad on the exterior of the phone, and you can flip it open and use the keyboard on the inside, plus the inside has a large screen where you can view quality videos. It's only $50 right now, plus if you don't like it, you can return it before 30 days. But instead of listening to me, do what I did and go to a local Verizon store and check out the phones on display.

BSlVGJ62aa	First of all, let it be known that Guitar Hero World Tour ships with a 'broken' drumset. The kit has known sensitivity issues and requires an extra cable to be shipped to the buyer and an annoying calibration process that should have been done before I bought it. If you don't want to mess with that, go with Rock Band 2 right away.<br>  Step2<br>  These games have very different interfaces. In Guitar Hero, the notes on the fretboard are circles and I think less pleasing to look at. However, being that I started with Guitar Hero I, I am more used to the look and feel of GH. But Rock Band 2 works just as well, it just takes some time to get used to if you grew up with GH.<br>  Step3<br>  Compare the tracklists of both games before you buy them. Although some of the songs are on both games, each game has its strengths and weaknesses. Compare them and listen to copies of each song before you decide which ones you'd actually like to play. Rock band 2 has better online activity. Go with rock band 2.|`|aG0Kfd22aa	first of all, matt.ball19, the guitar hero world tour COMPLETE BAND KIT comes with everything. You probably got the complete guitar kit. Anyway, dude i would reccomend rock band 2. I think it has better features and better online play|`|Xt31HyvWaa	Definitely rock band 2 because you have a full drum and guitar set unlike guitar hero where you only have the guitar.    Rock band is brilliant i have it.     TRUST ME ROCK BAND IS BETTER.
e8e0e4cc6750f11d7eebfe0f3af8eb0daa	There is legally a difference between a new and used item.  The exact difference depends on what you're talking about.  In the case of a car, the site below gives this definition of a new car for Wisconsin:  <br>  <br>  "According to TRANS 139, a "new" vehicle is any untitled or nonprivately titled motor vehicle of the stated model year which has not<br>  been operated more miles than required for manufacturer's tests, predelivery tests, dealer exchange or delivery. In addition to the miles<br>  allowed under the definition above, the vehicle may accrue up to 200<br>  miles for test drives by prospective buyers. A "used" vehicle is<br>  considered anything else, including executive and demonstrator<br>  vehicles."  <br>  <br>  A floor/demo model is not usually considered new.  Demonstration use typically means it's no longer new.  They should be listed as demo models when they are sold.  <br>  <br>  A returned item is usually considered used.  If the package was not opened, it might be able to be considered still new.  It could depend on the exact situation and your state or federal laws regarding the particular item.  I see a lot of stores selling returned items at a discount, clearly indicating that the item was returned.  The item wasn't returned due to a fault but because the customer found out it didn't suit his/her needs.  <br>  <br>  Something that contains used parts is not new as that implies it was repaired.  A repaired item is not considered new.  Even if it were repaired with new parts, it's shouldn't be considered new.  Something that has been repaired is usually called "refurbished".<br>  <br>  A seller should tell you if something isn't new.  You'll see demo items sold as "demo" and discounted.  Selling something as new that isn't certainly should be against the law.  <br>  <br>  With other items, it's used as soon as it's sold by a retail store to an end user.  In most cases, a returned item is no longer new.  <br>  <br>  If you pay attention to auction sites, the item being sold is frequently described as "new in box" or just "NIB".  This means the item hasn't been used and hasn't been removed from the box for use.  It may have been removed to be examined but that it hasn't been used.  <br>  <br>  There are grey areas.  One example of a grey area also relates to the "industrial" vs "consumer" definition and this is repair parts.  You may have purchased a part to repair your car or something.  Either it turns out you didn't need the part or it was the wrong one.  You take it back and the parts department will put it back into stock and sell it to the next customer as new.

Then copied these pictures to a memory card and could view them on my camera or show on TV.  If megapixels of imported pictures is too high or low you may not be able to view on the camera, but pictures will show and print on computers.<br>    <br>  If your computer has memory card slots, find the correct slot and copy pictures from the memory card to the computer.<br>   <br>  If there are no memory card slots on your computer that work with your memory card, purchase a Targus card reader at Walmart for $8.88 or another brand for less at Ritz/Wolf/Kit camera.  Also, they do 3? x 5" digital prints for 6￠ each on Tuesday and Wednesday.<br>   <br>  CAUTION   To prevent memory card corruption, keep batteries charged, format in camera, and don't delete or fill card completely.  Wait for lights to stop flashing then turn camera off before removing memory.  For card readers, double click Safely Remove Hardware.  Select, then click Stop and OK.<br>   <br>  After you have the memory card plugged in, go to My Computer and open the memory card, select the picture you want to copy, and then copy to the My Pictures folder under My Documents under Documents and Settings.<br>   <br>  If you have trouble with this, it may be easier to right click on Start and then left click Explore. Find and select the picture you want to copy and then at top left, click the X next to Folders to see a place to select Copy Files.  Now select the My Picture folder.  Make and select a sub folder then click Copy.<br>   <br>   <br>  You can also copy from the computer to a memory card. <br>   <br>  Have just been playing with this and found that it works really well, but you should first format the memory card in the camera because it adds files to the card you will need.<br>   <br>  Next, take a picture of something with the camera.<br>   <br>  Place the memory card in the card reader and go to My Computer. <br>   <br>  Open the memory card and you should see a folder on the left (DCIM) that has your picture. Do not open the MISC folder on the right.<br>   <br>  Double Click on the DCIM folder and you should see another folder e.g.,100HPM417, which includes the name of your camera.  Double Click on that folder and you should see the picture you just took.<br>   <br>  When you copy from the computer to a memory card, that is the folder where your pictures must be copied. You may only be able to copy one picture at a time.<br>   <br>  One last thing, the file names of your pictures must not have any additional letters or those pictures will not be seen by the camera.  Also, the file name format must match the file name of the picture you took e.g., HPIM1903.

They want you to get it legally (which sucks in my opinion).|`|VCzAkS2Haa	No. The iPod syncs what is in the computer. If you do not have the songs on backup, such as on the computer or a CD, do not put the iPod in your computer. If you need to charge it, buy a car charger or a iCube or something else that can double as an iPod charger.|`|FRrU2MUzaa	The normal way for control is that iTunes copies files to the iPod so if you connect your iPod and let things go automatically then the songs on your iPod will be lost.<br>  <br>  You need to recover the songs from your iPod before you let iTunes do anything automatically, so follow these instructions:<br>  <a href="http://lifehacker.com/software/ipod/how-to-copy-songs-from-your-ipod-to-your-pc-105256.php" rel="nofollow">http://lifehacker.com/software/ipod/how-...</a>

AA10566057	cool prank but way too much effort, you could start with a remote control doorbell from walmarts for about 11 bucks, take the bell off of it and use the electronics with an attached solenoid . you don't really want to construct a remote when they are so cheap to buy. solenoids are easy to find. i'm trying to think of a product (cheap) on the market that you could rob one from but nothing comes to mind as of yet. but they are around. i build lots of devices and do some programming and pranks are good in the head but way too much effort with minimal results.

vkzkXWfzaa	Any DSLR will beat any compact for image quality, particularly in low light due to the larger sensor on a DSLR.<br>  <br>  Add to that the ability to change lenses and lens quality. Kit lenses from any manufacturer are not their best, Pentax is a lot better than most. Any lens you fit will have anti shake as its built into the camera.<br>  <br>  You can do anything you want to with a DSLR long range telephoto, Macro etc. DSLR's do cost a lot more, you get much better image quality and the ability to use them in any lighting situation in return.<br>  <br>  Here's a side by side review.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/compare_post.asp?method=sidebyside&cameras=canon_g10%2Cpentax_km&show=all" rel="nofollow">http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/compare_...</a><br>  <br>  Don't let the extra Mp fool you it just means you can print bigger without interpolation (adding pixels).<br>  <br>  Chris|`|EJIsHdZhaa	The SLR is the way to go, the G10 is a top compact, but the images will never be as nice as those from an SLR, mainly because the sensor size is so much bigger than in a compact, this means bigger indivual pixels, which means less diffraction, less noise, greater control over depth of field.<br>  <br>  The overall range of the stock lens with slrs won't compete with a compact like the G10, but the difference isn't as great as you may think, the bonus is that you can fit other lenses to the DSLR, and with a pentax k mount, you can pick up some great used lenses for very little.<br>  <br>  Forget pixel count.  For the vast majority of users even 6MP is overkill, anything more than this is a bonus but not essential.  On a compact 15mp is waaaaay too much, the small sensor cant do this volume of pixels any justice whatsoever.|`|p8AYIz8iaa	pentax is toooop !!!
