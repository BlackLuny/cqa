I have a LG Net 10 phone that was $40 from Target and I got 100 free minutes.  It's okay.  The only cool thing about it is it's a flip phone.  I would ideally like a phone with a GOOD camera and a few cool extra gadgets.  I also want one that gives you the most minutes for your money.  The Net 10 doesn't give you many minutes and the minimum min. you can buy is $30 worth (which I didn't know at first) and that's kinda expensive.  It does have EXCELLENT reception though even in remote areas which my bf's Virgin phone does not seem to have.  Reception is important as I travel a lot.  I have bad credit so I can only get a prepaid phone.  THANKS for any suggstions!

Okay so I just saw this workout routine by a favorite athlete   And I'm thinking, that would be so cool to have on a little gadget to take to the gym.      And then I realize I'm totally clueless when it comes to new gadgets! I was a teen in the 80's and was heartbroken to be sat down and told Xevious and Mr. Do are no longer considered cool LOL Could somebody please walk me through the world of PSPs and Video i-Pods and other format devices? Basically I'm thinking of getting a little some'n some'n to while away the traveling hours (first person shooters? I hate most of them but I liked what I saw of the Tom Clancy games, but Myst III seemed cool too) and bring a portable gym coach and I'm not sure if you can do that with PSP or not, or even if PSPs are so last year and are now replaced with the Nano or whatever.      As I understand it, video iPods can have vids uploaded onto them and can be viewed but have no games. PSPs come with game cards(?Is this true?) but you can't upload video webcasts. Is there something in between? Do these devices 'talk' to one another?      Hmmm... maybe I should be talking to a salesperson...       Naw I'm pretty sure talking to customers would be better.

I currently have THIS camera. I got it in April of 2007... and it's served it's purpose well, but I've outgrown it.      I want more in a camera now. There are a couple specific features I'm looking for. I'm not exactly sure what it's called, or if I can afford them in my price range... But here goes:      *Face recognition or detection. The feature that focuses on faces in the picture.      *Fast clicky-ing... Whatever it is that will allow me to quickly CAPTURE a shot. I'm so tired of *just* missing the best smiles. I think there is "quick" mode on my camera, but it doesn't have the best settings.      *No-flash pictures that aren't blurry. I'd like to be able to take a picture in natural lighting without the flash and have it come out NOT blurry.      *Clear pictures. I'd like to be able to take a nice crisp picture, with clear lines      I'd also like recommendations for photo editing programs (that won't break the bank.)      If anybody can offer their input or experience on either of these, I would greatly appreciate it

Hi guys, I was just wondering if anyone of you has tried out this app or any other of the iTunes translator apps, and if they're really that good. Do you need internet access to translate things? I will be staying in Tokyo and don't know if I will be able to find any Wi-Fi hotspots that I will actually know how to use(lol). So if you know anything, please share. Thanks a lot ~ Sam.

20090205214151AAFF75U	Consumer Electronics;Music & Music Players	How do I transfer music from my iPod？ （Additional info)?	I looked up the other questions here, and I found some really good answers, but I wasn't quite sure what to do with my current situation.      So when I plug in my iPod, it immediately opens iTunes. I'm pretty sure the iPod syncs manually, so I wouldn't be able to save the music on there. There are quite a few songs in there that I don't have on my hard-drive, and I don't think I can find them anymore.      I looked at one of the questions, and I saw that you were supposed to enable disk use with your iPod. I didn't know how to do that, so I looked for a separate answer here as well. However, it seems that I need to plug in my iPod to do this, and since I don't want to lose all my music, I'm really afraid of what will happen.      I just downloaded iTunes, and my iPod has never been plugged into my new computer before. I was just wondering if there were some way I could enable disk use by plugging it in (or preferably without) without losing my music.      Thanks for all the help! =D

For the past couple of weeks I have been unable to download any updates for Bitdefender 2009 or Windows Update. Both give me the same error, failed to connect. My friend says that I must have the Conflicker worm, but I'm still able to access all the anti-virus sites and I even downloaded some Conflicker Removal tools. They all say my system is not infected, and my Bitdefender scan reports the same thing. So do I have Conflicker or is it something else?      Note: Using Windows Vista OS
