oSum3WABaa	well I've had mine for about a month now, and it's okay. I sorta expected more from it and stuff. Its good cause, its a touchscreen, and with the stylus. And its really good for texting, the keyboard is fantastic! One bad thing I've noticed is that it seems to go on the internet by itself?! like right now im charging it, and I checked on it like 5 minutes ago because I got a text, and it said the internet was running, when clearly I hadn't used it since I came home from school, strange?     If you have At&t I suggest you get a BlackBerry or something, but if you really want one, go ahead!    Ohh, and did I mention its size?! Its big and heavy, and at first I didn't care, I loved it! But now since I started putting it in my pocket, its hard to hide it in class!   I've dropped it like 5 times and like the corners on the back, where it looks like a diamond, in that area the paint wears off! you can clearly see it. It sux that At&t didn't provide a case!!!!  It has good games too, but most are just demos!

2TrwVADMaa	Is there any brand name on it or something??? cause if there is, then you can google it, find the website, and contact someone or something. It seems broken, damaged, or defected, because when my phone broke, it had a bluish purple screen too. Sorry to say this, but your mp4 is probably broken or really is in need to be reset,,,,,,,,,,,,check for a reset button if you can....    good luck, and i hope this helps.

lSziEO17aa	i think the touch. because it has many cases to play sports in. like you could get a arm-strap and play sports with that on.|`|ILBuQMtKaa	Even though I am an iPod Touch man, I would say Nano for biking, basketball, and exercise.|`|b6QzfsMUaa	nano.|`|i5MiFhMyaa	iPod nano. It is lighter, cheaper, and more durable.|`|VsR6LwmTaa	iPod nano because it seems more durable and its a lot cheaper.|`|i1JVe24Oaa	Nano without a question!  First of all the hdd inside of it it designed so that it will not get damaged while you are active, it is very light and you practically don't feel it. Also, it has more memory, which should be an argument of its own.     Touch is more of a fancy-pancy thing you use to show off, it is not practical, it has less memory, it is more likely to get damaged (especially the screen) and - why do you need such a big gadget while sporting? Nano for sure!|`|KeT55QP4aa	either the ipod nano because its so small or the best one you can get is the ipod touch as long as you buy the protective cover and the arm strap so that you can slide it in the pouch on your bicep. (try getting the arm strap with the buckle piece at the top for safety so it doesn't accidentally fall out).|`|gPox8FRfaa	well the nano might be better but still the ipod touch 2g has a built in speaker and the accelerometer allows you to play games. plus for the ipod touch you can organize everything and have it on the palm of your hand.

8954fc07df3a87bbbe417f77b9068b3caa	It's a price vs performance thing. Generally speaking you want to determine your price range first when buying any type of PC. This will play heavily as to the options you choose from. However, hardware speaking the main performance limiter (as far as games go) is the graphics card. Ex:    $900 CPU + $100 Graphics card = $1000 price decent performance on Games, but great for apps.    $500 CPU + $500 Graphics card = $1000 price great performance on Games, but only decent for apps.    What I would recommend to you is to research what you need for the titles you want to play. Then research the minimum graphics card that can do what you want. Move up a rung or two above that if your budget can afford it. Then decide on the rest based on that.|`|Z6ZM9p1waa	ALL GAMES ARE FOR MAC U RETARD!!! MAC RUNS ******* WINDOWS R U A RETARD???

kX4E5VKuaa	download and install the driver from the kodak website (link below) after installation restart your computer and then try plugging in your digital camera    http://www.kodak.com/global/en/service/d...    also don't have your other things plugged into different USB's at the same time, sometimes it causes conflict amount devices|`|6644da85d010d98c8e75bdddc3c55c49aa	Get a card reader--it will be easier. Your operating system supports it without installing any driver (yourself). It will also work with most, if not all, cameras.
Wd1bljhxaa	The same happened to me, so I looked at my account.  http://www.apple.com/support/itunes/stor...  Go to that link and click on Check Your Purchase History  (it is the first link in blue)  That should give your money back.  If that dosent work, just click on your account name and it should pop up.|`|kA14rQvXaa	hmmmm. got nothing|`|7Ug8dutVaa	this is happening to me too.   i got my card from coinstar.   when i tried to redeem my card it said that the pin number wasn't valid.   i checked the number like 10 times and it still isn't working. =(|`|oVz0fde6aa	You need to register the card, you cant just use it, duh|`|b1580e3d6f73c9d9495a1dde6ceb4c23aa	Maybe the activation at the check-out wasn't successful.|`|8yTxkqHUaa	It's a problem that everyone is having with iTunes right now.|`|Y2Xh8445aa	I'm having the same problem. I guess we have to wait it out. =(
ILBuQMtKaa	Yes, since it costs money to buy it, it will come on your bill. If you haven't given iTunes your credit card number then you will get a message that says ' You need to update your account' and it won't let you buy your app.|`|wdgrsn86aa	yes it will show on credit card bill  also it will show up in your email address  everytime i but something from app store  the bill shows up in my email address you used to make an account|`|8yTxkqHUaa	If you have your credit card in iTunes, it will show up on the bill.  Unless you buy a gift card at Walgreens or Target or Wal-Mart or somewhere.
ILBuQMtKaa	Here you can upgrade to 2.2 1G iPod Touch: http://ipodtoucher55.blogspot.com/2009/0...  Jailbreak for 2.2 1G iPod Touch : http://ipodtoucher55.blogspot.com/2008/0...    Good decision to jailbreak. It most certainly does not ruin your device.    I don't recommend you down grade to 1.1.4, there really is no reason for it. Everything that 1.1.4 can do, 2.2 can do 3X better.|`|8yTxkqHUaa	Don't jailbreak, it ruins your device.
z5IS0Qd0aa	The game should have 20 free song downloads right now.  Besides that, there is no way to download other songs without paying.  To unlock songs inside the game already, just play through career until you get to them.  Good luck!
ENgt8hENaa	i think your S.O.L kid. I would highly advise taking it to the nearest apple store to see what they can do. if you have a warranty, most likely that will cover the charge. go to apple.com to find a store. hope ive helped!|`|AA11762928	There is most likely water damage to the speaker. The only way to fix that would be to get a new iPod.    Also be aware that apple will not reimburse you even if you have a warranty. Water damage is not covered.
AFzb8sXCaa	Only if you install a converter box with a "smart antenna" jack between the antenna and your old TV.. The RCA brand converters have "Smart Antenna" jacks.|`|rH3ylNuYaa	that is not a good antenna any ways, and it will not work on your old TV after feb 17 , get a HDTV with a better antenna set up and you can enjoy more channels in high definition free.
f1b6b1b26d3210d42e24c9cb20a453f4aa	You have to have the wireless network adapter to access a wireless network, this is NOT  built in to the console.  It's an accessory you have to buy seperatly.  It attaches on the back of the console and plugs into the USB port on the back.  Once your connection to the internet is setup you can sign up for Xbox live from one of the menus in the Xbox Dashboard.|`|fLaONhy7aa	Okay Here's what your are going to need to do.  Sadly, no Xbox 360 has a built in wireless detector  And I don't think you have a Wireless Router.  But all you need to do is:    STEP ONE: Buy a Ethernet cable that could stretch to your TV  STEP TWO: Connect your 360 to the Router via Ethernet Cable  STEP THREE: Start up your xbox (A dashboard update is required, it will take a couple minutes)  STEP FOUR: After the update, go to the Dashboard and select "Join Xbox Live"  STEP FIVE: Follow the on-screen instructions to create your account  STEP SIX: Sign in the Xbox Live Dashboard and add your Xbox Live Membership.    Hope it helps!  -Kier *psst* make mine the best answer =)
4ZCSLUR1aa	Okay, this happened to me too, 10 minutes ago. I had 25 dollars and tried to buy a song, and that message popped up. But then I signed out, exited out of iTunes, opened it back up, and signed back in just a second ago. My money is back now. I'm positive it will work for you too. =)|`|U3bZAM96aa	Like the others I am having this issue too. I was buying music all morning since i just got a bunch of Gift Cards for my birthday. I have a lot of money in there and then all the sudden I got the message. I have been closing out of itunes, rebooting, etc. nothing is working. That was 12 today and still I am having the problem. I think iTuens is having a glitch of some sort. I hope it will be over with soon.|`|SsbLZ10saa	I am having the same problem! Except I had about $50!! I hope iTunes can fix it!

lebKMTaQaa	Well, out of the 20 or so games I have, this was the only one I sold right after beating because I would never play it again.<br>  <br>  It had freezing problems, which were resolved (for the most part) with a patch.<br>  The graphics are very good.<br>  Game play is fun, but gets quite repetitive.<br>  Controls are tight and responsive.<br>  Also, crap ending.<br>  <br>  If you can pick it up real cheap, go for it, otherwise rent it.|`|aROiy2Gnaa	i have it and it hasnt done anything to my ps3 but then again it is kind of a old game so  i would suggest gettting a different game|`|raEUval8aa	There are no problems with any of that. Never heard of any of those problems, and I've never had any of them myself. <br>  <br>  The only problem with Assassin's Creed is that it gets rather repetitive after awhile.|`|0e1e3b65b3c1de6ffdd4ebc197d8f144aa	When the game first came out, it did freeze my ps3 and i had to start the mission all over again and it happened quite often, but then there was an update that fixed this and it never happened on my ps3 again. So if u try to play the game for the first time now, it will update automatically. The graphics is not bad for a multi platform game it was my best game at the time.|`|1WgOj89kaa	When they released an update for the game which fixed this. Anyway, this game is just trying to copy the incredible Hitman series. Hitman will always be the best contract killing game, by far. Agent 47 is the legend.|`|xwEPYEqSaa	I got the "Greatest Hits" edition for Christmas this year, it worked perfectly fine. I beat it in 15 hours playtime (I like to do everything not just rush through the game) and it only froze on me once.|`|D0dcRRtMaa	I have never heard of the game crashing, and ill tell you right now, the graphics are insane! The problem with Assassins Creed, is that the developers were behind schedule. Their deadline was coming fast than they hoped. <br>  <br>  There are, i think 10 different places to do missions. But the missions are all the same. Go to the Bureau, Get mission details, Kill Target. There is no variation in the main quests.<br>  <br>  Of course, you can do the side quests that all the towns have, and sometimes you need to do them to unlock parts of the city that is locked. These can be Pick pocketing, Interrogations, Eavesdropping, and also you can help villagers who are being harassed by guards. Or Scholars.<br>  <br>  The Scholars you should always help because you can walk with them in cover to get past guards. Slow, yes, but definitely worth it. Another thing, is with the villagers, if you save them they will have a "brother" or "husband" come to your aid with their gang of thugs.<br>  <br>  All in all, its a great game, and i would highly recommend it. The looping main quest is the only real problem i have with the game. There is suppose to be a number two coming out, which i have high hopes for.<br>  <br>  Hope this answered you question.<br>  <br>  C17
AA10262609	These cameras are the best there are this side of digital SLR's which are heavy and bulky.  I have had a Canon G-7 for about 3 years and it is great.  The biggest difference is the G-10 takes pix in the RAW format which is only useful if you are really into fine tuning pix into that last 10% of the capabilities of many photo editing programs.      Digital camera battery life is greatly extended if you routinely use the range finder rather than the LCD screen.    Canon G-7, 9 and 10 will accept SDHC cards which are the higher capacity cards.      All digital cameras will take landscape portraits etc.  What separates cameras (and their prices) are the shooting options.  For action shots the Canon G series is great when pix are shot in the continuous mode (camera fires with continuous pix for as long as you hold the exposure button) using fast cards such as the Sandisk Ultra II or Extreme III.    For close ups the Canon G series has Image Stabilization which helps when you shoot without a tripod.     Frankly you cannot go wrong with any Canon G series camera - select based upon price.|`|HX6JjCTyaa	Canon G10 is better 14.7 MP with newer technology  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001G5Z...

03nPoqXiaa	Nothing.    Sadly, its a known problem in Windows, that the connection drops from time to time.    I thought about permanently having my Lappy provide the wireless internet that the Xbox would need, but it constantly dropped.    I would recommend hard-wired, mate. Ive always gone that route, because its 100% reliable.

A lot of times Vista won't automatically download the drivers for those older cameras, so you have to do it yourself.  Hope this helps.|`|3e354ee85999a7bc21252e59e538dc35aa	If you have a mini dv (cassette) camcorder.  Your dv camcorder needs a firewire connection (ieee 1394) in order to download video, your PC probably did not come with a firewire port, so you will have to buy one and install it, since most computers (except possibly brand new) don't come with a firewire port, your camcorder did not come with a firewire cord so you have to purchase a cord too. Your camcorder did come with a USB cord and that is used for downloading stills from your camcorder. Make sure your camera is in playback mode.  The fine print in your manual makes reference to firewire (ieee 1394) connection.|`|N1CIndMOaa	Hi Mike,    Try this:  Restart your computer  Connect camera to computer with the USB cable.  Turn it on camera.  If nothing happens, try another USB port on the computer and redo the steps again.    (Also, check to see if your camera shows up an another drive in Windows Explorer. Sometimes the pop-up doesn't always show when you connect an external device.     If that doesn't work, go to Sony's website and see if you can download the camera's drivers.|`|AeEuNkKZaa	You need a firewire cable.  The transfer rate on USB is too slow and the quality will be awful.    You can do the transfer yourself or have StashSpace.Com do it for you.    Do it yourself method:  Connect the camera and computer using the firewire computer.  Load stashSpace application and turn camcorder to VCR more.  Click add scene from camcorder and then press record.  Press play on camcorder.    Have StashSpace do it for you:  Send StashSpace your tape(s) and they can transfer the miniDV tapes to digital files.  You can get a DVD back right away, get the digital files back for local editing, or use their online editor to watch, share, and edit.   The transfer costs $7 and DVDs cost $15.      Go to http://www.stashspace.com to learn more or get started.  They are running a promotion right now where the transfer is Free with a premium account membership.  Good Luck!

p3rnyBoYaa	The bell price for fish stay the same. The Dab is always 300 bells, A squid is always 400 bells, and a Goldfish is always 1300 bells. Depending on the time of year and time of day and if it is snowing or raining you may catch different fish. A stringfish is always 15,000 bells but it is only available December through February and only between 4pm to 9am.|`|BMConIedaa	No, Nook's fish prices do not change during the day.  You probably caught a similar, but different fish, such as a Dab and an Olive Flounder. Or a Bitterling and a Blue Gill.  A lot of fish look very similar.    Ideal fishing times are between 4 and 9 PM, although some fish only appear outside of those times, and some fish only appear during rain or snow.    Read up some faqs at GameFaqs  http://www.gamefaqs.com    or at ACC  http://www.animalcrossingcommunity.com|`|dNrDhzkHaa	The fish in Animal Crossing all depend on whether there is snow/rain and time of day.  Better fish come out during rain/snow and the best periods for catching fish are early morning (when sun is rising), evening, and night.  The ocean has the most expensive fish in it, as it has more rare fish in it.  By the way 150 bells is pretty much nothing in Animal Crossing.|`|glynFK9haa	That doesn't matter.  It all depends on the fish, not time of day.

It's a different bandwidth.|`|aROiy2Gnaa	no u cant|`|c84e3d7c6c8ecfe924819637cbf13e07aa	probably not, and it would be slow anyway. Most internet plans only include data that is on the phone, not if you use your phone as a modem. It'll cost you a fortune if it's not included, if you can get it to work.|`|1WgOj89kaa	No, the PS3 can only get online with wired, which involves an ethernet cable going from the modem into your PS3. Or Wireless, which is when a wireless router is used to send a signal around the area, which the PS3 Picks up. So, no, sorry|`|V7jRP00yaa	uuuuuuuuuum no

RpCwfcRzaa	For wireless, you need to buy the $100 wireless adapter. No other adapter will work with the 36. If you don't want to pay that much (and no one does), I'd go with an Ethernet cable instead. You need HDMI cables that are made for the 360 either from Microsoft or a third party maker like Mad Catz. The PS3 ones have different hook-ups and won't fit. Your choice for storage is either a memory card or hard drive. You can't use an external hard drive or flash drives for game saves. They have to be the official 360 ones. I'd go with a 60 GB hard drive. It has plenty of room. There's a pack available with the 60 GB drive, a headset for Xbox Live, and an Ethernet cable all for $100 which is a good deal.|`|QIlhmWwBaa	the xbox comes with the av cables to play just like the ps3 and it would not come with xbox live you would have to buy it and you would have to buy a hard drive in the long run and the wireless thing costs so i would just buy a cable instead <br>  i would just buy a 360 pro 60 gb instead of buying the arcade from your friend|`|FZqaXTd7aa	It is very hard to read you question. For future questions proper punctuation and capitalization would be very helpful. That being said, the HDMI cables you have for your PS3 will work just fine with your XBOX 360. Newer 360 consoles now have a HDMI output, older models do not. The XBOX 360 does not have wireless integrated, to connect to your wireless network you will need to buy an Xbox 360 Wireless Network Adapter which retails for about 80 USD. As far as the HDD goes, there are a few options, 20GB, 60GB or 120GB. The size you want all depends on what you plan on doing with it. If you plan to play on live I would recommend the Microsoft Xbox Live 60GB Starter Pack which retails for about 90 USD.|`|Pdor28csaa	Not quite sure i understand the question, but to use x-box live i believe that you need an Xbox with an hard drive, you can connect to your router using a cable but if you want wireless you need to buy a card, about ￡60 from hmv. also xbox live costs a fiver a month ish<br>  <br>  hope it helps

AA11056614	All Blu-Ray disk (BD) players will also play DVDs (and CDs). The quality of the result varies since all BD players upscale the DVD to pseudo-HD, and the quality of the video scaler varies.<br>  <br>  BD players do pretty much the same job on the Blu-ray movie, so the extra money for some players pays for better build quality, better processing (audio and video) and more features (re ability to do things other than play the movie ... e,g, streaming video, BD-Live support, play games).<br>  <br>  Given your comment about price, unless you are willing to pay premium prices for disks, and really need a new player (in which case a BD player is more "future proof" than a DVD player) I'd suggest a moderate quality upscaling DVD player will give you only slightly inferior results to a BD player ... particularly if you have a relatively small HDTV.<br>  <br>  I have a lot of DVDs and plan to only play limited numbers of BDs until disk prices come down. I therefore selected a player based on high priority for how it handles DVDs. My choice was the Pioneer BDP51FD since it's recognized as arguably the best players for DVD, audiophile quality for CD and exemplary for BD as well as being excellent build quality. That said, it isn't inexpensive (~$270, 6ave.com).<br>  <br>  My advice is to consider if a relatively small improvement in video and audio is sufficient for you to want to pay extra for BD disks (buy is ~30% more than DVD, and rental is also more (but varies)). If so, buy a BD player (~$200), but if not (i.e. you are likely to stay with mainly DVDs) buy an upscaling DVD player (~$60-$75) now and plan to buy a BD player later when prices are lower.|`|jwgB4PDNaa	Yes Blu Ray players do play normal DVD's I think the cheapest and best value one is a playstation 3, as you can connect it to the internet, and get updates on there, if you get a blue ray player and they come up with a new updated version, you may need a new one. but if you buy the PS3 for about ￡290 that has a blue ray and can be updated.<br>  <br>  Blue ray players are not that much different in price to a PS3 either, they are quite expensive<br>  <br>  :-)   <br>  <br>  hope this helps|`|4819659b1e05d8917e5d499e81d3fcbcaa	if u don't have any blu-ray disc , there isn't any need to buy blu-ray player unless u r investing for the would b future of getting into blu-ray.the bluray player can play regular dvd n can upconvert to a better picture.|`|uDuwc7Yoaa	Yes, blu ray players play regular dvd's.

RxB0ivXoaa	It really depend on what you are looking for. Consider that the sensor in the camera is significantly larger than point and shoot cameras, offering better detail, less noise, greater contrast and color saturation. It's also about the size of some larger point and shoot compact cameras, making it convenient for carrying with you. It truly does a great deal in a small package. I chose an Olympus DSLR because it offered better image quality, while still being highly portable. These new cameras are making me consider a change. If you want a high quality camera that is very portable, it could be the way to go. If you prefer a camera for more specialized usage, a more traditional SLR may be the right way to go. I have seen people lugging around large DSLR cameras and it takes a toll as the day goes on.    As for lens selection, there are more set to be released this year and an adapter to use 4/3 lenses on these cameras. That gives you a full range of lenses.|`|1abaa60b0511b1e2c248dd1b30e73037aa	THEY GOT GREAT OPTICS, LEICA LENS. BUT I'D SAVE UP FOR A DSLR|`|n71t0xoCaa	The G1 is technically not a dSLR it uses the mirrorless micro four thirds system. Since this camera does not have a mirror or a prism its not an SLR it uses a live view finder ( electronic view finder is a common term for these or EVF cameras) to accomplish what the mirror and prism does in a dSLR. ( The best review I have seen on it said it was "nearly as life-like as that in an SLR viewfinder") , Its an interesting concept and worth watching to see where it goes and how it works out. I personally do not think it has "arrived" yet. The sensor on it is smaller than an APSc sensor. But still much larger than most point and shoot ( about four times the size of a typical EVF chip). Sensor size though is one of the more important things in image quality The sensor has recived good marks for color but not so good mark in the area of noise in the bit I have read on it ( small sensor often means smaller pixels = more noise so thats not surprising) . With the G1 the quick phase-change autofocus system of traditional DSLRs is missing and the G1, like all Micro Four Thirds models, relies entirely on a contrast-based AF system like a compact camera, contrast based autofocus has traditionally proved very accurate but slow. The press releases on the G1 swear they have beefed up the processor to give it faster performance but I cannot comment on this, The G1s contrast-based AF system will only work with lenses which support it, which may limit your options with full-sized Four Thirds optics. On the plus though the optics are smaller and lighter than the optics on DSLR. The big market for these would seem to be those wanting both interchangable lenses and a very small light camera.    Its strange, when I was doing alot of backpacking I would cut off the handle to my toothbrush to shave ounces, leave out anything I was not pretty sure I would need but still I would find the weight of the camera and lenses never an extravagance but always a necessity. So unless something big changes my mind I do not see myself going to a system like this. I don't think it will replace the dSLR cameras for the more serious photographers ( larger format sensors seem to be the continued trend there).  But I can see the appeal of a smaller camera to alot of people so I think the format will continue to evolve and grow. It just may not be all you want yet.    Added: AWriterWandering thanks for the sensor data but several use the 2/3" sensor ( Nikon Coolpix 8800, Olympus C-8080 Wide Zoom, Sony DSC-828 , Konica Minolta Dimage A2  etc)  which is 8.8 X 6.6 mm =56.08 mm2 or about 4 to 5  times ( 4.33) . I do admit my math was ballpark.|`|LGybB71maa	Ummm let me think definetly not i mean u can get a camera just like that any where for just 100 to 200 bucks don't watse ur money...|`|tWoN22rRaa	Actually the G1's sensor is 6 to 10 times larger than what is typically found in fixed lens cameras. Eg.    1/2.5" : 5.760mm * 4.290mm = 24.710mm^2  1/2.3" : 6.16mm * 4.62mm = 28.459mm^2  1/1.8" : 7.176mm * 5.319mm = 38.169mm^2    (compacts today... especially so called "superzooms"... lean more towards the small end)    4/3 : 18mm * 13.5mm = 243mm^2    APC-C (Canon EF-S version) : 22.2mm * 14.8mm = 328.56mm^2  APS-C (Nikon DX version) : 23.7mm * 15.7mm = 372.09mm^2    --  Why is this important to note? Well because it means that this camera's sensor is still far closer in size to a dSLR's. In fact it's exactly the same size as a 4:3 camera. So while it may not get the high ISO performance of a APS camera, it's still has a significant edge over compacts. And that is certainly worth considering.    But anyways... what I would suggest is that, if possible, you try it in your own hands. Along with some dSLRs in the same price range. Compare and contrast. And then pick the camera that you ultimately feel is best for YOU.
FZqaXTd7aa	I would recommend removing the battery from your controller and cleaning the the gold contacts with a new pencil eraser on both sides, the controller and battery. Remove any debris from the pencil eraser and place the battery back in your controller. You should see a red light on your Play and Charge cable when the battery is being charged and the battery will likely get slightly warm while charging.
2ae80ff81188ccc128dfeb85edf626a8aa	Olympus cameras do not have live color effects outside of its E-series DSLRs and maybe its SP-series ultrazoom lineup. You can apply the effect after you take the picture in the camera or by using the included Olympus Master 2 software.

I now have the A700 and it has a dedicated auto focus assist lamp.|`|AQ4b4Iilaa	Turn off red-eye reduction.
nnZDsSBFaa	I think you're talking about Dead Rising : Chop til you drop    It's coming out on 24th Febuary.    Dead Rising: Chop Till You Drop delivers a more immersive, intuitive and interactive experience as players use the Wii Remote to shoot, slash and bludgeon their way through a zombie infested shopping mall, fighting for survival.    The game follows the harrowing tale of Frank West, an overly zealous freelance journalist on a hunt for the scoop of a lifetime. In pursuit of a juicy lead, he makes his way to the small suburban town of Willamette only to find that it has become overrun by zombies. Frank escapes to the local shopping mall, thinking it will be a bastion of safety but it turns out to be anything but. It will be a true struggle to survive the endless stream of enemies, but players will have full reign of a realistic shopping center and its varied stores offering an endless supply of real and makeshift weapons to fight off the flesh-hungry mob. If Frank is running low on health he can pay a visit to one of the many restaurants or cafes for a meal in order to restore his energy and continue the fight. It's a brutal fight, but with no end in sight to this zombie onslaught, Frank bides his time by messing around with a variety of comedic costumes and making use of improvised and sometimes highly ineffective weapons such as a toy sword or a football.|`|C7rV71Cjaa	Dead Rising Chop Til You Drop is coming out in a few months which is a port that uses the same awesome engine from Resident Evil 4.

AA11056614	I assume you mean will you get better results than DVD?<br>  <br>  Yes.  But resolution will not be quite as good as on a 1080p projector (since a 1080i projector is really a 720p model that accepts a 1080i signal and scales it to fit the ~720 pixel display), so the improvement over DVD will be less than it could be.<br>  <br>  Resolution is not as important as dynamic range/contrast, saturation and colour accuracy, so the relatively small improvement in resolution won't make a big difference relative to DVD since you won't have changed any of these three parameters.<br>  <br>  I found that Blu-ray was better than upconverted DVD on my old 720p projector, but not startlingly so. Given the higher cost of Blu-ray players and disks I'd say only go for it if you are prepared to pay a lot more for minor improvement.|`|c84e3d7c6c8ecfe924819637cbf13e07aa	you will see videos, in 1080i?

KQL3tqS7aa	First off, I'm not sure about getting a new phone for free if it breaks under warranty.  Usually, the phone will be sent into the manufacturer to be repaired and those repairs would be covered under warranty, leaving you with the same phone, only fixed.  As far as damaging your phone within warranty specifications....you're not in luck.  It truly has to be a defect with the phone.  They can tell if you take screws out so that voids the warranty right off the bat.  Anything that you do to it will be deemed as physical abuse.|`|hnR1wHzQaa	Maybe try magnets to the screen,or maybe in the mircowave for a few sec not to long tho.Extreme heat maybe like a hairdryer or stick it in the freezer for the night.

The only bad thing about this phone is that when you put it in your pocket, it tends to call random people in your contacts. Even when i put on keyguard, it still calls people!! I've heard that the OK button gets messed sometimes, but mine still hasnt messed up yet. the front screen is too small, i wish it was bigger. overall, its an ok phone.

HBNx77BBaa	If $100 or so is acceptable have a look at the Canon Powershot A590IS. You'll need a memory card too which will be another few dollars.    UPDATE: Hope you see this. That's a good budget - takes you well beyond the budget range. How about the Canon Powershot Canon SD880 IS (Ixus 870 IS).

otLK5QFzaa	yeah my friend is 11 and she has a cell fone|`|sfC6L8ybaa	Why?  Seems very hard to justify.|`|ksZSL3Nwaa	I THINK ITS A GOOD IDEA FOR ALL ELEVEN YEAR OLDS TO HAVE A MOBILE THEN YOUR MAM ARE DAD CAN GET IN CONTACT WITH YOU ARE MAYBE YOU NEED TO GET IN CONTACT WITH THEM IT SAVES THEM FROM WORRYING WHERE YOU ARE TO SO I THINK ITS A DEFO YES.|`|IxD8aNHTaa	no its stupid, what can an 11 year old possibly do with a cell phone. who is she gonna call? she wouldnt have any other people to call besides om and dad since no other 11 year olds will have one.|`|VrjF986Aaa	well if your parents want you to have one so they can contact you i see no problem with it  but if you're just trying to look cool or something that's pretty stupid, I mean i didn't have a cell phone until I was 16 and I had to get pre - pay and a job to pay for the phone and minutes myself. I don't really see how an 11 year old would need one anyway.|`|hYRP0x2Eaa	There is nothing wrong with it. My cousin is 10 and has one, though she only calls her parents. Personally i find it pointless to have one at such a young age. I see it as a waste of money. But get one if you want and if your parents agree.    But also, will your parents even allow you to take it to school? Doubtful. You won't be able to use it many places only because 11 year old's don't stray too far from home. I don't know, it's a waste to me.|`|iPcO4kmKaa	NO!!! there is absolutely NO purpous. no 1 else will hav 1, who r u gonna call/text???? u dont go out by urself alot at 11 anyway. if u r sure u need it really bad (u play like 10+ sports or somethin) get one of those pay as u go. NOT prepaid yes theres a difference. tht way since u wont use it tht much it wont b such a waste|`|27MRNeH4aa	If you are a responsible person and your parents have a great cell-phone plan where it would only cost them around $10 a month to add you on.  Its great to be able to get in touch with my kids whenever I want to.|`|ZHajpMSyaa	nope|`|lb7exqUgaa	its up to the parents, but I think that is too young. Of course if it is for emergencies they have those "kid appropriate" cell phones with the big buttons and automatic 911 speed dial thingy. but 11 yr olds dont have to be texting or anything like that. When I was 11 I had to use the office phone at school for emergencies.|`|KYYJyi0Uaa	if you take care of it and you really need it than yah but if you have it because you just want one then no.i think it is not ok to have a cell phone when youre like 10|`|kt9iXMWUaa	I don't believe age is an issue here.  The question you need to ask is why do I need a cell phone?  What does your parents think?  My son is 12 and he has a cell phone which he uses only durring his paper route.  This way he can call if needed.  But he is NOT allowed to take his phone to school.  Perhaps I feel safer if he has one while he is out on his bike.  Maybe your parents will too.  Good Luck!|`|MHy3RVZEaa	Possibly a trac phone or something along those lines, but a phone with a contract? No. There is no way an 11 year old could use a phone enough, so it would be a waste of money.|`|6kuJgjEhaa	If:    Your parents approve  You will pay for (most of) it  You have people to call  You will take care of it    Hope this helps! Good luck!|`|DvFtOGWbaa	yea its ok to get a phone because its great thing to have in case of an emergency|`|m56Ty3zmaa	I would think so...I know an eleven year old that has a cell phone..she's on it a lot though...lol|`|O0YdC5hqaa	I GOT MY FIRST PHONE WHEN I WAS 11, AND THIS WAS LATE, BECAUSE BY THIS TIME ALMOST ALL MY FRIENDS ALREADY HAD PHONES.

W5JjCD9gaa	It is a type of telecommunications system used buy mobile phones and alike to transmit and receive data.     3G is faster than 2G, but slower than 4G (very rare, possibly only in Moscow).    It means that you will receive crisper sounds whilst making phones calls, and faster internet/downloads through your phone. 3G connections allow you to surf the 'real' internet (the internet you receive on your home PC) on your mobile device, instead of having to make do with simplified mobile internet.

You can also check the browser settings on the phone and change them around to allocate with your normal internet service provider if you have one.(i don't think this is easy or legal) I would contact cingular or whatever company you have service with and purchase some sort of internet plan.

LUDvSeIdaa	Usually when you accidently submerge any cell phone in water, the best way to dry it is to take the battery out, flip/slide open your phone, and let it rest. I don't know if you tried that but if you didn't, try doing that.     But like the others said, phone usually kills electronics. My best bet would be to get that phone upgrade :).

b7w8JaWzaa	installing the game DOES put the entire game on your hard drive , but microsoft makes it so u have to have to disk in to play it , otherwise everybody wud just rent games and not ever buy it.  the only other way is to mod the xbox around that cd detection so u can install games and play it with out the dvd but that is illegal and voids your warrenty|`|u4blAQT0aa	yes, you get the whole thing, but you still have to keep the CD in the cartridge for it to work.

3e354ee85999a7bc21252e59e538dc35aa	If you have installed the software that came with the camera, just plug it into the pc with the camera usb cord and it should come up automatically, if it doesn't go to MyComputer and open as a drive and copy/paste or drag/drop from the camera to your pictures file or take the memory card out and use a card reader and open as a drive and copy/paste or drag/drop to your pictures file.
pvSdlj1uaa	Go to voicemail and listen to any new messages.  After you do this call voicemail again.  The phone will say "You have no new messages at this time", then enter a series of prompts (the first of which should be "To listen to old messages..." When you hear the one about changing your greeting or personal message, press the key it tells you to and do what the voice says.|`|TOoNHNv9aa	if you are talking about setting your personal message you dial..    *86.. enter your password and you should be able to get to your settings.... you just have the listen to the options... =)    if you are talking about leaving a message.. once the person you've called has finished talking you just wait for the beep, and leave your message for them.  you dont have to hit   when finished, you can just hang up. it will work out fine

dNrDhzkHaa	Not yet there is no black wii, however one is being worked on right now.  Nintendo said that they are working on hardware for the Wii 2 and plan on releasing it sometime in 2011, if it is made.  I don't know about the colours for the XBox 360's, but the XBox 720 is also being worked on right now by Microsoft, and will be released shortly after the Wii 2.  In that time period anything Playstation related will be gone since it won't live up to what the Wii 2 and XBox 720 will offer.|`|E0oPgSyEaa	There is no such thing as a black wii, but if you want you can buy a vinyl cover sticker for it that come in many designs.|`|ZpR57jbBaa	we must look like google to you|`|DkSv6OZzaa	YES there is a black wii...and no they don't sell it in stores you must by a case  http://www.consoleshop.com/product.php?p... look at this link and you will see, you can get black red, green, metallic silver, ones with neon led's that change colors, any case you can think of, you install it yourself, its really easy to do...

iLTlJszaaa	If its connection to the TV includes 2 RCA cables (left white, right red), then you can buy a female-female Y-splitter that converts: 2 RCA jacks to 1 TRS jack.  You can connect the headphones to the TRS jack.  Such a splitter device is often included with surround sound systems.

8qUtwu7Oaa	You will be lucky to find somewhere that will allow you to download music for free, and if you do, it's probably going to be illegal.   There are lots of sites that allow you to download tracks for about 9cents each and about $2 for albums.   I use http://www.mp3obsession.com/   It's got millions of tracks so they are bound to have something for your barbie mp3 player that really wont cost u a lot at all!  Hope this helps you, let me know if you find a legal free site to download music from!|`|YG3DQLC0aa	hey if you want to download music then try http://www.kptunes.com where you will always find your favorite music with the best and good quality sound tracks. i have been using kptunes for a while and i am happy the way it works. they have the largest network and huge music collection from any artist of your choice. once you have enough music downloaded then connect the MP3 player Via USB cable which came with it and then you can copy & paste or drag & drop music from the music folder to MP3 music library folder.    Good Luck|`|BPZ4sGLnaa	This is the best website to download unlimited free Music/movies. I am really pleased with the service offered on this website.

f419df7a7a06e14dfdf6ab874c949c5baa	you could use a simple program like 'quicktime' and just put the tracks one after the other...  or if you want to do some fancy work, overlaying, fading, beat matching etc, a program like 'ableton' is very good.  it can be difficult if you want to do advance things, but is really it's as easy as you want it to be, if you have some knowledge of computers.

I suggest get a memory card?|`|m2TAgNuuaa	go too settings auto erase than put it too on  then thats it! try it :]
ej6OdnDBaa	ok so on your ipod summary part, check manually manage music   and then apply   then delete all the songs you dont want   then go to your limewire library and drag the music you want   if you dont want all your limewire music, drag it to your ipod individually
bx3Nq7lAaa	http://www.ventones.com     is totally and absolutely free,   you are most likely clicking on an ad from within their site,   Ventones is  a free site and thats how they make money.   i know quite a bit about online stuff,.     i use Ventones to make my own ringtones,   they allow you to make a ringtone from an mp3 file  or you can even make  the ringtones from youtube videos.   Just give them the address of the youtube video      but if you wanna download other people's ringtones,   you must follow these steps ( i learned them from someone because i had the same question as you a while ago)        (step 1)     login to your account on ventones      (step 2)    go to your My Ventones page and click on any ringtone that you have  already made in the past. that will take you to their "free ringtone preview page"  and that page will have a send to phone button. Don't click on it though!    if you have not made any ringtones in the past, go to the Ventones home page and click on the Mosquito Ringtone  link. That one will also take you to the "free ringtone preview page" and it will show   the Send to Phone button. Don't click on the Send To Phone button though!    (step3)       Next open Ventones in a new window. Find the ringtone you want   (from their free ringtone page)  and click on it. that will take you to their "free ringtone preview page"   which will not have a send to phone button    (step 4)    Now go back to the first Ventones window (the one with the mosquito ringtone)  and select the option that you want. In other words, go through the process   of sending and clicking on the send to phone button.    You can either download the ringtone or decide to have it sent (texted) to your phone.   It will send you the ringtone you opened in the 2nd window
uY8E0nVCaa	Connect your iPod to iTunes and go to Movies or TV Shows or wherever you put your movies on your iPod and just click play from iTunes.    Extra info that might help you: If you don't want to watch the movies on your HP Mini 1000 small screen there is a cable you can buy from the Apple Store to connect your iPod to your TV for a better viewing experience which costs $80 but there is a simpler way to watch it with your tv. If you have an S-Video cable, connect it to your TV and to your computer and connect them. Instead of spending $80 you can use an S-Video cable which you can get from Future Shop/Best Buy/Circuit City/La Source or any other technology electronic shops for just about $6. Good luck

n72QDikzaa	go to their site
S7L1o8HIaa	No. It would be cheap if you had to pay. But for songs and apps, there is an additional five cents added onto your purchase so maybe that is for special charges. No you actully do not have to pay, BONUS!|`|7uczaVUcaa	ya u do i have one.its great worth saving for  i got mine for xmas from my mom|`|IJ5S5Bxoaa	There are no other charges on the ipod touch except what you pay for it at the counter. Unless you buy the songs you want off of itunes.  But no, you don't need to pay for the internet or youtube or anything, as long as you have access to wifi you can surf the web completely for free! Oh and you might want to pay for some apps but you don't have to. There is a lot of apps you can get for free.  Good luck!|`|gKQQds8Haa	No there is no monthly bill for youtube and the internet though if you want to have internet in your house you will have to pay monthly for your internet connection for a router if you want wifi in your house.

t2rUhyANaa	Shop around for a Nikon F-1,2,3 or any of the FM series. There should be some on Craiglist or e-bay.    Your existing lenses will work fine on any Nikon camera body. But they sure as heck won't fit a Canon ae-1 or any other Canon body.|`|1abaa60b0511b1e2c248dd1b30e73037aa	craigslist. i see a lot of canon ae1 's cheap|`|n71t0xoCaa	There are so many you can go with a Nikon FM, Nikon FA  a nikorrmat ftn, an f1, f2, f3 ,etc look on adoramas used camera section you will be surprised how affordable they are
8BDSWGwmaa	yes, and you cant give 20 pts...|`|N0hlErEyaa	yes it will! i do it all the time but u probably shouldnt keep on getin the newest version cuz i did that and now i cant get my itunes on my laptop or my phone.|`|Pwqx6yZvaa	yes it will keep all of your songs, all it will do is update the format. nothing major usually.|`|37L53mDIaa	maybe not... my bf just upgraded his, and it completely deleted his entire library of songs. and it took a long time to get it all back.|`|otLK5QFzaa	no i tried it and it didn't so i downloaded then to a hard drive and got the new i tunes and then downloaded the songs on my hard drive on the new i tunes version|`|h0kHLeTuaa	yeah no problem at all, besides a few format changes.|`|qLtfINFdaa	Yeah you get to keep everything. I thought you would lose your music if you downloaded the newest version, until I downloaded the newest one myself. Nothing changes, you have nothing to worry about.|`|i0eJb8tZaa	I think it's 10 pts. Anyway, your songs should all stay there. Apple wouldn't be that slack.
ZFuiy3Tsaa	I download podcasts from iTunes directly into folders my Zune monitors for podcasts. They import with no problem. Some of the podcasts I subscribe to are not available through Zune Marketplace. I import them into Zune and the subscribe button show up. I click on it and past the link to the podcast website. They download for me without problem after that.|`|ca44e4978f073cfbe40e189d1ad4fdacaa	The Zune Software should search through all folders (including iTunes folders) for media. If it doesn't, you should be able to tell it where to search for stuff.     Microsoft was hoping to "convert" some iPod users and wanted to make it easy for people with iTunes to switch over to Zune because let's face it, if it was a pain in the *** then nobody would do it with all the people that do have iPods and iTunes.
bx3Nq7lAaa	i second Ventones, its the best and most reliable site you will find.   Just do a search for free ringtones on google and you will see that they are on first page, you can't get more reliable than that because if google has them there, its because they are really free.       anyways, that other site you used to use sucks because you need internet on all sprint phones.  And since they send a link you can't do it.     There is ONLY one free ringtone site that will work for sprint phones without internet,   and thats Ventones    You will need to make the ringtone, but you can make it from an mp3 file or a youtube video    read their step by step tutorial here on how to make free ringtones for most sprint phones without internet. here it is, follow the step by step instructions closely, or it will not work      http://www.ventones.com/free-sprint-ring...|`|6pTlTyvMaa	http://www.venmobile.com    This is the best site for FREE ringtones. You can upload an convert an mp3 file into a ringtone right on their site and you can also make your own wallpapers. It works awesome. its a free site, i use it weekly.  I have never been charged or spammed. Its really 100% FREE.
becbbc070b924453c0b189d4a9d17b80aa	It is very simple, you need to reprogram the Dish remote with another code that matches better your TV.  Many brands, like SONY have 5-7 codes. You need to try ALL codes for your TV and see which one makes the volume to work as well.
6489dd6288438d0ac1d6bd81b79f0d8daa	Yes, you keep asking the same question over and over again...I answered one of your previous questions regarding the SX110 IS, but you really seem to be stuck on making a decision.    The newest  model, SX10 IS will most likely have slightly better image quality because it features Canon's latest Digic IV image processor. But, you will probably not notice any real difference between these two cameras' image quality, especially when shooting in good outdoor lighting.    However, the main advantages (features) that the newer, SX10 IS has over the SX110 IS is that it has 20x optical zoom compared to only 10x optical zoom, 28mm v 35mm, the ability to record movies in stereo sound, a stronger flash, a vari-angle LCD screen and it also has a viewfinder.    The SX10 IS can be bought for just over US$300 online, so for ALL those extra features it's definitely something to think about.

But when it all adds up, the phone bill's preeeetty big.|`|AA10445134	i disagree.  it absolutely does not cost 40 bucks for unlimited.  i have unlimited and it only costs like 20 bucks.  buti have at&t.   but i know for sure the difference iisn'tgoing to be alot.  probably like 5 bucks?  ohh n if you wannt to txxt without a plan its either 10 or 15 cents.  it may sound cheap, but after a nice long conversation with your friends, it could add up very easily.  that happened to me once, and i had to pay like 100 buckss?  it was really bad i was in alotta trouble.  if your a texter, then go for the unlimited.  if you think your not gonna txt alot, go for the 500 one, or 200 one.  one more thing: if you dont get a plan, but still decide to text,  each one you sent is going to be 10-15 cents, and so is the ones you recieve.  (:  guud luck.!
mX0qaX3Eaa	How do you mean?    If you call your supplier and give them the IMEI number you can have the phone blocked so that it's useless.    The IMEI number is the 14 digit number that is unique to your phone, it should be printed on the box and possibly your bill. Call your supplier and they may even have it on record.|`|qWcw4Vz2aa	yea but u have to call verizon / sprint and ask them to do it|`|A1TLSiigaa	yes but call the company to deactivate|`|NCvX4I0baa	I think it is possible for the phone to be activated by someone else if you've canceled the line.|`|9bqtCqgDaa	think so, ring it see if anyone answers, even thou they prob took ur sim card out.

4Pk6VNftaa	The 360 doesn't have a built-in wireless adapater, so you'll either have to buy one for the 360, or buy a wireless bridge (located in the networking section of your computer store.)  Some routers can also act as bridges, which can be cheaper than a normal bridge.   As the name implies, a bridge simply makes it possible for your wired network equipment to use a wireless connection.  If you have the choice, get the bridge. A bridge will work with any equipment that has ethernet, unlike the 360's Wireless Adapater which works with the 360...and ONLY the 360.|`|OPOBIzqMaa	The only way is to buy a wireless adapter for your xbox 360, which generally runs for like $99.00 I had the same issue so what I do now instead of spending all that money is just take my modem into the living room when I am going to be on live and set it up in there so I don't have to deal with it, then bring it back into the other room when I am done.|`|WI1q9kbBaa	Use a cable! It lags a lot more if you have wireless.

cDYowiDNaa	I recommend getting rid of verizon! I canceled my verizon phone service a month ago because they were constantly messing up my phone bills. They were always trying to sneak in new charges.They were adding new charges every month and sometimes they would send me 3-4 bills. I had to call them every month, waste my lunch-break, just to get them fix their mistakes. They would always apologize, but the same thing happened every month. Finally, I decided to cancel them and get service else where. Well, I paid my final bill. Some how I managed to over pay it and they sent me a check for the over paid balance. The funny thing is that the very same day that I got a check in the mail, I got a letter from an attorney that was representing verizon, and it said that I owed verizon $21.00 I couldn't believe it. I got a check and a threat from verizon on the same day. I have had service with them for years, and I always paid my bills when due.  If anyone has verizon, you should watch your bills closely

If you enter the shopping channel you can download the Opera browser for a few bucks, and start surfing the web with your Wii.

b7xKoYqBaa	Most Sony around the head earphones are pretty reliable and fairly comfortable. They are usually available for only about $20 as well. Those can be found at any of those retailers.  However, I would recommend getting a pair of "Skullcandy" headphones. I just got a pair and the sound quality and comfort level for the price of only $50 is unmatched. Even if you are not into the whole look of Skullcandy, they are the best quality you can get before shelling out the big bucks for the high end Sony's or BOSE.

KaNmQwAhaa	Have you tried using the code on the receipt instead of on the card? they should be the same but who knows if the register messed up and thought it was a different one of the itunes cards they sell instead of the particular one you bought. i dont know. but anythings possible i guess. but the code on the receipt should always be right. if you still have trouble you cant get customer support from the itunes website or even call them. surprisingly you dont have to wait on hold for long either.   but they always email you back within two days at most and then maybe 5 business days at most to fix your problem. these kinds of things should work right off the bat and you shouldn't have to go through all the trouble to get them to work but thats life i guess. well good luck!|`|S7L1o8HIaa	In Canada, you can not redeem a card to the app store.

Need to ask them to pair the card to the new box also otherwise some features like recording may not work.|`|R5LJiO6raa	i think you have got to call sky to pair your card to your new hd box  you do not have to pay the extra 10 if you don't want to, you will get some hd channels for free including bbc hd and poss a few more (not sky hd channels though)

sI6m9uQfaa	If you like blue dragon and final fantasy you will definitely like Lost odyssey and Tales of vesperia.  Fable II is more of a western RPG nothing like Final fantasy.

Might still be a good match for you, not sure.    Fable II has gotten good reviews, but it isn't a Final Fantasy type game.    Other games you may want to look into are Mass Effect, Oblivion and Fallout 3.  While they aren't Final Fantasy-style, they're all very highly rated.|`|WI1q9kbBaa	FALLOUT 3 is the best!

GY7n0nl8aa	Most of your local stations are in HD during prime time movies, but your news etc. will not be.  Not all channels will be HD. If you want maximum HD channels you'll need to switch to Dish network or Direct tv. Most of your cable companies offer a limited amount of HD channels compared to the satellite companies.|`|ofpmRvHpaa	If you currently have cable or sat - you usually have to upgrade to a new receiver to get the high def signals.    The HD version of "Regular Channels" like the major networks ABC, CBS, NBC, etc. are usually included for no extra charge with both a standard def and HD versions.    This is because if you use an antenna - these channels are available for free.    If you want to use an antenna - type your address into www.antennaweb.org and see where the TV towers are around your home and what size antenna you may need to get their signals.|`|jLi5DiYdaa	Yes, that TV has it built in and most digital broadcast stations are in HD.

VkhabZTraa	Bull, that is old school and the reason when you go shopping that most of the sales room is lcd. I know that's what I thought. I then was lucky enough to catch a knowledgeable sales man who explained that the old plasmas are not the plasmas of today. Look at an LCD from the front then move 4' to the side you will see a big difference in quality. My plasma has the same picture from the extreme side and 15' away. The plasma has a bettor picture and doesn't take two pixels, and combine them to make one part of the picture, action sports are crisper. The kicker is I got a 50" 1080p  top end Panasonic for $1160(shipping incl.) at the New Years sale at tigerdirect.com. I also got my hdmi 1.3c cables off amazon.com for ten bucks each vs. the fifty bucks they wanted at the electronics store for monster cables. The picture is awesome.However if you leave the screen paused on something for a long time (hours) you can burn an image in, but that is why plasma's now do the same thing as a computer with an lcd display when left alone, a screen saver moves the picture around.|`|557c65c1d2224dfe3c2fe5c6f798e6e5aa	Panasonic makes great plasma sets at reasonable prices.

Plasmas are bad. They tend to burn into the screen if you're not careful on how the tv is being used. Go for an lcd, it may cost more but its worth it in the long run.

zj91sSsuaa	Leave it on and put a magnet in the center of the screen over night.  Then take it away before she sees it.  When she turns it on all the colors will be messed up so bad she will demand a new tv.  It'll still work but you won't like the way it'll look.  But if you're still bent on destruction you could get the cat to pee on it, that works half the time, I recommend it being off for that though.|`|nQ7G1nBVaa	Just buy the new set.|`|iLTlJszaaa	NO!  Please don't do it.  Cathode ray tubes are good TV's that last a very long time.  Contrary to popular belief, CRT's offer superior picture quality, contrast, tint, and response time compared to LCD's.  Don't let the HD's higher resolution fool you: experts agree that contrast, color depth, and response time are much more important than resolution.  Not to mention HD sets are depreciating in value rapidly, and if you wait awhile, you'll likely get a much better deal.  I remember the day when a 20" LCD television cost $500, and it wasn't that long ago.  Yes, please don't take a sledgehammer to the screen, because if you break the screen the vacuum inside the tube will force all the leaded glass inwards at an extremely high velocity, and could possibly bring the sledgehammer (and your arm) in with it.  Plus once the glass hits the back of the tube it will bounce back, and you'll have a badly cut-up arm (and possibly the rest of your body too) with lead oxide all over the place.  If you really want to get rid of your old TV though, you can sell it.  I'd buy it...

4Pk6VNftaa	Microsoft's only involvement with the iPod was when they invested in Apple back in the 90s.  (Yes, Microsoft owns a small chunk of Apple.)    The iPod was originally firewire only, and only worked with Macs.  The main reason Apple went with Firewire was 1: it helped develop firewire so there weren't any license fees, and 2: USB 1.0 and 1.1 were just too slow.    Soon enough, however, iTunes was ported over to the PC, and USB adapters appeared for use with the iPod.      Later, the iPod went USB only when USB 2.0 became widely available.    Apple's decision to make iTunes available for the PC came from market pressures - not Microsoft.  Microsoft doesn't benefit in any way from iTunes or the iPod (other than their stock went up in value).  If anything, the iPod is now a competitor, considering that Microsoft now has its own portable media player line with the Zune.

Awy82nOfaa	There's another way:    www.ventones.com    If you do not wish to register for an account there which requires your mobile phone number, go to www.bugmenot.com and enter www.ventones.com for some Ventones accounts you can try (usually the ones with over 60% accuracy work).    Once you've got onto Ventones with an account, it will be very easy to get started. First, you will need an audio file or song in .mp3 format. You can email me if you need an .mp3 file for a specific song. Upload that song into Ventones. Once it is done loading, you will get to choose a 30 second segment from the song to be your ringtone. To make it sound more realistically like a ringtone, I would suggest choosing the one second fade at the end.    Next, once the 30 second ringtone is done uploading, you will be given the options to either download the file to your computer, enter your phone number and have it sent in a text, or generate the download URL and enter it in your phone's web browser. (I would choose the last option to enter it into your phone's browser.)    Once it is in your browser, it might get slow, just because the download files are setting up and all that stuff. It will automatically download (it's a very small file) in about a second or two. To find the file, go to your "My Music" section (name will vary based on carriers; just play with it a little) and set the song as RINGTONE.     Congratulations, your song is a ringtone =)    (Note: I'm not sure if you have to pay to download it because you're using the Internet. I don't think I had to pay)    Hope this helped!
3NdNpoqlaa	if you are using a microsoft windows operation system, check to see if there are any Windows Updates.    the same thing happened with my ipod touch and when i updated the computer, it worked perfectly again.    to put song on your iPod shuffle, you need itunes, which can be downloaded from www.apple.com.au

You have to hit all the rocks with a shovel until money pops out. When the money pops out, keep hitting the rock until it stops popping out money. You can get as much as 8,000 bells!    Dig up fossils, get them checked out by Blathers in museum, sell at Nooks. You cant sell them by themself but you can sell them with other stuff.    Check the recycling bin and lost and found for furniture. If you dont want it you can sell it at Nooks.    Crossbreed flowers. If you want more info about this email me.    THE STALK MARKET!- Every Sunday from 7?- 12:00 PM Joan the turnip lady comes. She offers red turnip seeds for 1000 bells or white turnips. White turnips vary prices. Red turnip seeds- Bury them and water EVERYDAY! If you dont it will wither and die. Water it for 6 days and dig it up. Sell it at Nooks for 16,000 bells! White turnips- Pretty much like the stock market. When you buy them the price could be any amount. Say its 97 bells. Well o Monday you go to Nooks and ask how much hes selling turnips. He says 65 bells. Dont sell turnips. Tuesday you go and ask again. He says hes selling for 115 bells! That would be a profit since you bougfht them for 97 bells! You sell them and make a profit. You could wait to see if the price goes higher but you MUST sell them before that next Sunday. If you wait too long they will rot and you would have wasted money. You can not sell turnips on Sundays.    Hope i helped you out!

Having a Tuner in your computer allows you to record the television that you want to watch to your hard drive or to an optical disc of your choice.  Its really up to what you want to do.  It is possible, do some quick research and know what it is that you truly want to do first.      It is possible that you can get a TIVO that will work with a computer, or another "media bridge" device.  I prefer to stick with the internal or USB tuner on the computer... for the most part it just works.  Most will also allow analog video inputs so if your cable company makes you use their set top box for television signals you can still record the video to your PC or Mac... Also be aware that copying videos off of television without written permission might be a violation of copy right laws in your area.

fwnqB0dTaa	The one thing you won't get is 4G service on a 3G phone.    That's what the G is - GENERATION    And that's not generation of iPhone, it's generation of technology.    A 4G phone may be backward compatible to 3G systems, but a 3G phone won't be able to deal with 4G enhancements.

You then have to use a phone to return the page.    Pagers have largely been made redundant by mobile phones.

Many of them are free.    http://wireless.5linx.com/mobile/?r=5lin...|`|QXffenE8aa	sony erikson phones are always good|`|pwlgAnb3aa	I have had a Motorola, Sony Ericsson, Samsung, LG, and now the Apple iPhone.    The motorola was nice, had good service, and I'm veyr clumsy and it took my falls graciously.    Sony Ericsson was my absolute favorite! It takes a few days to get used to cause it is a lot different but oince you do, you'll never look back. PLUS- you can record things, like songs from the radio or personal messages and set them as your ringtones, that was always nice.    LG- i have nothing good to say, mine lasted for a very shrot time, the battery life was terrible and it wasn't very good.    I had a Samsung blackjack, but it only lasted 3 weeks and it broke from a fall. I liked it, but its not very tolerant of falls.    All of my friends who have palms don't like them.  Pantech Duos aren't rated very well, however, it could just be unhappy customers.  My best friend and mother have Blackberry bolds, and they are very complicated.. I don't care for them, but if you're into that, i suppose its cool. It's always good for quick texting!    As for my iPhone, I absolutely LOVE it! HOwever, there is one flaw and that is the battery life is way short if you are constantly playing on, but just adjust your birghtness settings and it will make your battery life last longer.  It is super simple to use, and very convient. Buttttt, you have to pay an additional $30 a month for the data plan, but it is absolutely worth it.        Either way, you have 30 days to take a phone back if you don't like it.. so play with it as much as you can before those 30 days are up and you can always take it back (:  Hope this helped (:|`|c6PRMsW4aa	um to be oneat with u i ahve not herd anything good about the ipone but i would look in to verizon phone i had at&t they were ok but once i went with verizon i had a lot more bars in the places i did not have with At&t. verizons phones are cheper than at&t and also the phones are bult alot better than verizons phones i have the voyager it has went throw alot like water and still works thats wat i call a phone|`|9XXybEuQaa	HTC Fuze and BlackBerry Bold|`|oNpQMsHWaa	iphone|`|16B46LU4aa	i have the at&t quickfire! i reallly like it!|`|OwChIe5Waa	The matrix  Propel  I phone is the best.

N9nJWYa5aa	Wii Sports, make sure you are following the instructions on how to use the Wii Mote.  You have to hold buttons at certain times and let go at the appropriate moment...<br>  <br>  Wii Fit: Are you standing too close to the TV while using the balance board?  You could try moving the sensor bar to the top of the screen and then adjusting the placement in the Wii's settings.<br>  <br>  Mario Kart: In game you normally hold the Wii Mote horizontally.<br>  <br>  Try reading the manuals that come with the games, this could point you in the right direction.|`|5HfuI3MEaa	you just need to buy a new sensor bar and wii remotes, not a lot of money, but first try to plug in the sendor bar into the wii more, then check if it will work. if u really want to send the wii in, back up all your game disc save data on a 2GB SD card.|`|AA11045021	What game are you playing? Not every game has motion sensing features, like Super Smash Bros. Brawl.

HVS|`|kFoka1VZaa	the email and internet is one of the best parts that was for me. you can download shortcuts to some of your favorite websites and save them to the main menu so you click on it and it goes right to it. the facebook app for it was always my favorite. the camera on it takes good pictures too.
fwnqB0dTaa	Simple answer - NO    Tracking (which can't be done by the general public, UNLESS the person who owns the phone has given consent to have their phone tracked, just law enforcement agencies and similar) relies on the phones regular signals it sends to keep connected to the network (or the call signal if in use).    This doesn't happen when the phone is off.    EDIT:     The person below is incorrect.     Even with the battery in, if the phone is off it DOES NOT attempt to maintain a network connection, and therefore is not trackable.     Tracking is done by triangulating between network towers, without a signal going to those towers there is nothing to triangulate.    Sounds like some conspiracy theory doing the rounds to me.|`|YRTmPJ1uaa	Actually, now they can. And by "they" I mean largely officers of the law & federal govt., with a warrant to do so...  Apparently they can't if you take out the battery.
MaOcrip1aa	The Voyager!|`|TGeTsqVoaa	I would have to say the enV2. All three phones have very similar features but the enV2 is cheaper than the Voyager and the usage and standby time is much better. The Glyde is not in the running quality-wise and I've read a ton of reviews with complaints about the responsiveness of the touchscreen. I checked it out myself and it has a mind of its own.<br>  Here are a few specs:<br>  enV2 price $129 (after rebate) usage time 320 minutes standby 520 hrs<br>  Voyager $149 (after rebate) usage time 240 minutes standby 480 hrs|`|Mw3NWvMWaa	i have the voyager!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  i love it because it has a keyboard and am fast on it. it is touch screen but i dont like like the  EnV2, or The Glyde the just don't look attractive.|`|8QiVEGNsaa	i have the voyager, which i love, its great for texting and i love the touch screen.<br>  my friend has the env2 and almost all her buttons on the front have broken, which is not good.<br>  my other friend has the glyde and she just doesn't like it.|`|AA10179458	I like the Voyager also.
AA11470978	Ok dude, not hard, just take it back to wherever you bought your xbox 360, and tell them what happened (without swearing) and they will probably replace it as it wasn't your fault (unless you already threw it at something). If the people working at where you bought it, are stupid, and know nothing of video games, like at Wal-Mart then call Microsoft and they will fix, or replace it.    So yeah, chill out, just because its broken doesn't mean it can't be fixed.

VMVW3E7Aaa	About the color accent option: it seems to be a current fad that people are getting excited about.<br>  The camera keeps one color and turns everything else black and white.<br>  <br>  I would never use such a feature for the following reasons:<br>  <br>  ? You are very limited in what you can do.<br>  ? The function isn't always reliable or accurate. The camera's idea of "red" might be different to yours. It will often include/exclude areas that don't want to be included/excluded.<br>  ? Imagine  if you just happened to take your best photo ever, but instead of having a real color photo, you only have some partial b&w thing that might look totally awful. You'd kick yourself.<br>  ? If you do the "Selective or Partial Desaturation" (as it is called correctly) in post processing, you have much more control over it, and will get a way better result. Plus you can keep your original color version, too.<br>  <br>  This also applies to any color effects done in camera like b&w or sepia - you're better off NOT to.<br>  <br>  If you don't have your own image editor, you can go to www.picnik.com and use their effects menu which makes it very easy.

There is a possibility that you can get it unlocked for like 450 euros in England on O2 or Vodafone, or in France on Orange ( EU laws forbid carriers to sell a mobile phone unlocked if it does not have a unlocked version on the market too).

4Pk6VNftaa	Do you really need that 2nd number?  If not, cancel it.    The phone company usually has a package deal if you get multiple services from them at once - like phone, DSL (internet) and even TV (usually repackaged satellite service.)  However they usually just pitch you a low initial price for the first 2-12 months.  After that, the prices go up.      However, in many cases, you can renegotiate your prices just by asking the customer service rep. on the phone.  Companies would rather keep you as a customer, even if it means giving you a slightly lower price.|`|0QOAKWeCaa	Complain about how expensive it is and say how other companies offer the same service from a lower price. Ask for the supervisor. Make it seem as though your business with them is of a value to them.

If they are getting bad you can report them to your service provider, or the police in extreme cases, who can then track the caller down and get the callers provider involved (as with computer ISPs the phone provider is responsible for ensuring that their systems are not used to harass or abuse others).

8gOR04Emaa	YES! WAY TOO YOUNG!  its so annoying seeing little kids with cell phones (no offence)  i dont even have one and im 16.|`|Q1LXnEcNaa	well if u need a phone so u can contact yer father when your out...or if u stay after school and need to get picked up at different times. but as for the texting its pointless wait until your about 13...its annoying seeing little kids on their high tech phones...because when i was that young i didnt have that same technology that you do.|`|c6PRMsW4aa	no u are not i got one when i was 8 and u just have to look for deals thats how i got one now i have the voyger and i am 13|`|HBFHZXybaa	Yeah. kinda.|`|j6jQ4Cq1aa	If u r an only chid, you should get one or elsew nope. Wait till ur 13 kid|`|tokcUJSpaa	I got mine when i was eight, but thats when I started riding the school bus alone. I dont think its too young, I'm eleven now. I dont know, i guess you're going to just have to prove to your dad that your responsible and mature enough for one.|`|kCghGbopaa	maybe do some stuff around the house.  I think a 10 year old is to younge to have a cell phone! sry!  I am 13 right now and i just got a "real cellphone." Before i used my dads old one...i think thats ok for a ten year old cause its not valuable.  To Prove your responsible do some chores, be more nice to your parents, get a good grade on a test or report card!|`|DYkBV4Wfaa	your 10?????? thats to young most of your friends are not going to have a cellphone at 10 anyway. i got my first phone at 13 in7th grade right at the neck of real life socially.  im 15 now|`|tyD7OOFCaa	It is annoying, but my seven year old nephew had one.    Yes I am jealous, I was deprived.|`|Wj212FWXaa	my little brother got a cell phone when he was 8.  ask your dad if he will get you a pay as you go phone; he pays a certain amount of money for a certain amount of minutes, and when you run out of minutes you have to wait until he buys more for your phone.  you can try that to show him that you are responsible and wont be yapping up all his money.  also, you can ask him about a family plan; my family is on one and my dad pays for his phone, but everyone else's plan is just $10 a month.
OcbtPCtvaa	You will need a new SIM.  Call AT&T and get an iPhone voice and data plan that suits you.  It's that easy.|`|RtQaCYUuaa	take it to your local phone shop|`|c6PRMsW4aa	u have to call At&t or go there and they well do it for u and i thing transfer evering thing if not yet done it is most easist to call|`|tyD7OOFCaa	Sorry Charlie, you need a contract or prepay phone card.  Nothing is for free.
ggGZf8hMaa	I like the Voyager better! They both have very similar internal screens and keyboards! The only difference is the size and the external display which is much better on the Voyager.|`|Mg6WPmZoaa	i would go with the voyager bc i had that  phone  for awhile and i liked it alot and ppl tell me they dont like the env ! so personally i would go with the voyager !!!!( :  good luck decidingg.,|`|BN1xFAzjaa	The touch screen on the Voyager is seriously slow and honestly quite useless... I had one for about 6 months, and never used the front (touch) screen but to read messages occasionally.  However, it does have a nicer (larger) internal screen then the enV2.  Texting on the two phones is nearly identical.      If you don't mind the difference in the screen size, go for the enV2... Its a good phone and costs less.
fT63ryOaaa	I ordered a $322.00 motorola q from them on dec. 24th and also was blown off after countless e-mails on progress of my order by the middle of jan also got fed up and requested a full refund and was assured by mr. booker himself I would get once I sent a written request which I did twice I was also fed the line of their overwhelmed workload well today is feb 5th and they are still blowing smoke up my *** but I am going to file criminal fraud charges oh and FYI the booker entities inc phone   is 214-291-5957 but they don't answer that either you have to leave a message if their business is so good they should have no problem refunding $332.00 they sure didn't need all this crap to take it from my credit card|`|3v14ng1saa	I was gonna post the same question because they don't have a phone   to be contacted.

m17MZfWHaa	You are exactly right - I would use a male-male cord (I've got two) the gold plated ones work best.    The software I use is MP3DirectCut - it is freeware. It always uses the 'what u hear' audio from your computer.
2TrwVADMaa	Yes, but you would have to rebuy or if its free, then redownload it......|`|egLhVY35aa	yup  you can sync itunes to ur ipod or buy them off the app store on the touch   it should say that u have already bought this app would u like to download them  say yes|`|YKKrzbP0aa	you can sync your itunes to your ipod|`|Pxq8qyuvaa	yes just do it like you did before
2TrwVADMaa	you really should have two separate accounts, one for each of you but here's wat to do anyways::::::: basically just go to the itunes home page, and then in the first box on the far left (the one that says "music, Videos, ......etc) then click on ipod games, and then from there you can buy your game and then sync it...    This SHOULD work :)   :]     good luck

1HtTxOOQaa	Well, Mac games work only on Macs(I hope you know what Macs are. they are the computers produced by Apple). The PC games work on PC Easy.  There are a lot of PC games as compared to Macs(ratio might be 20:1 if not more).    These games do not work on each other cause both the Macs and PC come with different OSes installed. Macs come with Leopard and PC comes with XP or Vista.   You can install an alternate OS in a Mac. So you can basically install Windows XP or Vista legally on a Mac and then play PC games on it but the same cannot be done on a PC(since Mac is copyrighted if you install it on Pc you are doing an illegal thing).     Usually Macs are for people who do graphical stuff and don't need deep gaming. The PC on the other hand is for people who like gaming.   The Leopard OS on the Mac is much much better compared to Vista (since it's faster and doesn't hang or get viruses!!!). Graphically Macs are a better experience but gaming wise a PC is better.|`|381e3207230460fe8521d523304a91a6aa	Mac games can only be played on a Mac.    PC games can only be played on a PC.    Mac/PC games can be played on either the Mac or PC.
nYyugKOkaa	I have a Panasonic Lumix DMC-TZ5 and a Canon camera too. I really like the TZ5 better. I haven't had any grainy pictures inside or out, actually I've been overy happy with the performance of the TZ5.    I actually took a picture (it was outside not inside) moving 40 miles per hour in a vehicle and to my surprise it came out great.

VOSyb1fcaa	There are three ways to get internet on your Wii. You can do it through a router (recommended), you can get a Wi-fi USB and put it in your computer's router, or you can use a LAN adapter.     Look here for more information:    http://www.nintendo.com/consumer/systems...    Next, watch this video or simply follow my instructions below:    http://us.wii.com/connect/    1. Click the Wii options button in the bottom left corner on your starting screen    2. Choose wii settings    3. Scroll to page 2 using the arrow on the right    4.Click internet    5.Choose connection settings    6. Click on connection 1, 2 or 3    7. Choose wireless connection (Or wired if you're using a LAN adapter)    8. Click "search for an access points"    9. Click OK    10. Choose the from the connections your Wii has found (Look for your connection. You might have to provide some sort of password)    If all goes well, you'll have to click OK a couple more times, wait for it to test the connection, then the Wii will reset itself and then you'll have internet!    Good luck!|`|tzFkYLGqaa	If you have a Linksys Router,Youre good to go.    If you have a 2Wire Router,The WEP KEY is on the bottom(10-Digit Number)    If you have a Netgear,Sorry those dont work.|`|mZlIwdEeaa	go to internet connections and type ur in your connection name|`|cHkcZLe6aa	The Wii is wifi enabled right out of the box.  It does not require any other hardware.  If you've got a wireless connection available, all you need to do is go into the settings of your Wii, have it scan for your network, and then input the security key (provided you have secured your network) of your wireless network and that's pretty much it.
4Pk6VNftaa	Your DVR's s-video connection is for OUTPUT, not input, so that won't work.    Does your TV have a composite video connection (yellow RCA port)?   If so, you can get a S-video to Composite video converter, and connect your laptop to your TV using that.    If your TV doesn't even have a composite video connection, then you'll need to go get one of those video switches that can output RF co-ax.  These are usually advertised as being able to "Connect a DVD player to any TV" type of device.  They have 4 s-video or composite video inputs, and can output RF co-ax.  Just connect your PC to one of the inputs, your DVR one of the other inputs, then connect the switch to your TV.  Now you can flip between your DVR and PC.
lkqjJisaaa	Empenage is wrong, as Beijing Olympics showed many Nikon users.  Here is visual proof:  http://img.stern.de/_content/63/41/63419...    2 answer yor question, get the D90.  It will work with more Nikon lenses than the D60 will.  The D90 will also do video; D60 will not.  Oh yes, the Canon that can do video is thousands more.    D90 is more oriented towards pro photographers and enthusiasts with different features.  D60 oriented towards snapshooters.    Ignore any thumbsdown, as Empenage will thumbsdown everyone else.|`|8EmeNHyjaa	Nikon D90 is better to get.  http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?i...|`|3mAgM405aa	Go with the Nikon D90 because it has video with sound capability.  However, if you are on a budget, then look at advanced bridge point and shoot cameras, such as a Sony, Canon, etc. which have comparable features found in the D90.    Here's a very affordable alternative with a Leica lense.    If you are really on a budget and want the best quality for the money, check out the P&S Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ28 [with a Leica lense] which has more features than most pro DSLRs that require auxiliary lenses not even equal to the single initial full-range lense that comes with the FZ28. It is reviewed at:    http://www.steves-digicams.com/2008_revi...    It just came out on November 4, 2008.    It's an all-in-one 10.1 megapixel digital camera which includes (i) built-in image stabilization; (ii) HD720 quality video [Quicktime] which permits zooming while videoing; (iii) a 18x zoom [27 - 486 mm (35mm equiv.)] "Leica" lense for nature photography; (iv) up to 0.39 inch macro option; (v) up to 6400 ASA; (vi) takes up to 380 pictures per 120 min. battery charge; (vii) has a "burst speed" of 13 fps; and sells new for $315 at amazon.com.    Here's an actual handheld picture of the moon:    http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/...    If you can take a handheld picture of the moon with an 18X zoom, concert coverage should be a breeze.    Good luck!|`|1abaa60b0511b1e2c248dd1b30e73037aa	GET A CANON. LOOK AT PRO SPORTS ON TV, WHAT ARE THE PROS USING. YOU WONT BE ABLE TO USE NIKON LENSES ON A CANON LATER. READ THE REVIEWS IF YOU DONT BELIEVE ME|`|tWoN22rRaa	If you're planning to get serious about photography, I would say the D90 is the better buy. The D60 is a someone crippled camera in that it lacks the body motor needed for older style Nikon AF lenses; It can only autofocus with AF-I and AF-S lenses. The D90 doesn't have this limitation. The D90 also has a much better viewfinder, more dedicated controls, and advanced features like a built in wireless flash commander. So you're left with a lot more room to grow with a camera like this. And yet it's just as easy to start out with.|`|TwIK4Ivlaa	Get a D60 (between these two models) and buy good lenses for the money saved.|`|6xEpscamaa	They are both really great.  You won't be disappointed with either one.  The D90 does have a better lens included, and it also has the info LCD on top.      But you won't go wrong with either one.|`|xG5ZlJDqaa	Contrary to what the person said, it is possible to use Nikon lenses on a Canon slr, using an adapter, but not vice versa. I recommend the D60 for the beginner. That way, you have money left over for some decent glass.|`|9e00e91a75ce8fd7739bf446a1e98f67aa	Yes look at the reviews.  http://www.dxomark.com/index.php/eng/DxO...

So1T9DKPaa	What you have is the newest version which doesn't have the Memory card reader along with 4 USB ports on the front of the console.  Fastest to recognize whether you have the older or newer model is the number of USB ports you have in the front.  If there are 4, you have the old 80gig.  2 ports you're hooped.    HVS|`|UphoLYGYaa	the guy in the video has the first 80GB model, which flips up and has sd, compact flash, and memory stick duo slots.

lkqjJisaaa	Camera needs contrast to focus.  If U aim camera at area of low contrast, it will not focus.  Example:  Aim camera at white wall.  Camera will not focus.    As for light that makes flashes go bad...too much ambient light can do that.  Or a spot light that's a different color temperature.|`|6644da85d010d98c8e75bdddc3c55c49aa	You don't need anything externally to "mess up" a photo. All you need to do is point the camera and close your eye when you take a shot. Bad composition alone will mess up a photo.
QYB6oRacaa	I'm sorry to say, but the XSi only comes in 12mp . You might be confusing it with the XTi which was the older generation Canon and it has 10mp.     You are also confusing professional with beginners camera. This are both beginners - if you want pro camera you need to be looking at the 5D Mark II and 1Ds Mark III which neither I recomend you at this point in time and both over twice and three times the XSi.    Anyways, I'll recommend you get the XSi and enjoy it - Is a better cam than the XTi.|`|8EmeNHyjaa	canon Rebel XSi come with 12 MP.Maybe 10 MP that you said mean canon rebel XS.I would suggest Rebel XSi which have better features than Rebel XS.  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012YA...|`|qIR9DB9Haa	Your probably looking at the XS and the XSi which are two different cameras, the XS is 10mp. Basically the XSi is a better camera, the XS is just the bare basics of a DSLR. The XTi is a little cheaper than the XSi and is also 10mp and the only real difference is that it doesnt have live view. Dont worry about the mps, you wont notice any difference. I would go ahead and get the XSi if you think you might stick with it, and the XS if you are really unsure.|`|Ur6H8gwkaa	ditto on what's been said.    My 2 cents, don't base your buying decision on megapixels, having more doesn't always mean better photographs. look at features, ease of use, does it do everything you need it to do within your budget?    Also, don't confuse dSLRs with the term professional.    Some photographers will argue over where the pro gear starts, but it's safe to say that regardless of brand, the pro dSLRs usually start out at around $3,000.    The Xti, XS and XSi are entry level cameras. Pro photographers wouldn't even use these bodies for a back-up body (well most anyway) Entry level doesn't mean they are bad, they take fine pictures, but they might not have all the features and abilities that pros want or need.    Reviews for all the cameras you've mentioned are all over the net.|`|a3tlinoNaa	There is almost no difference between 10MP and 12MP. Neither of the cameras mentioned are professional, those are "soccer mom" cameras, intro level models.|`|AA10912074	Just because the XSi is not used by most professionals, don't think that it is not an excellent camera.  It is a huge step up from a point and shoot camera and offers most of the same controls as intermediate cameras and professionals.  If you can use this camera effectively, then someday going to either a D50 type camera or above will be pretty straightforward.
UYvgIazcaa	Hell, unless it is badly cracked, you can often fix a scratched CD with toothpaste or a banana.  (no really)    Toothpaste is a very mild abrasive.  Get some of teh old fashioned kind.  The cheapest you can find.  And then rub it on the CD for a while (longer than you really feel like doing it) over the scratched areas.  Rinse it off and give it a go.  It won't look pretty.  It might even *look* worse, but it can work just fine.  I spent maybe 5 straight minutes of buffing a CD to fix it, but it did work.     The data is recorded on the *top* of teh cd, on the reflective layer.  The bottom layer is clear plastic, and all you need to do is buff out the scratches enough that the laser can read the data.|`|BAreok8zaa	idk if its true u tell me
VPnCk2Muaa	It only counts for his one profile. You can have a free month for every new Xbox Live profile though. You can do this by creating a Xbox Live profile, and when it asks you if you want a silver or gold membership, say silver.

This means you can both play Live together on your console, or you can play on his profile. You cannot however play Live on yours just because his is stored on your Xbox.
MSI5s64faa	I just got the 50mm 1.8 for $85 on Amazon (also have it at BH photo)...and it is amazing! It takes super crisp photos, and this kind of lens is great for portraits! I have just started my business in photography and this is a great investment. All the gals at ilovephotography.com just rave about it! Of course the 1.4 is better but it is also $300 more...<br>  <br>  edit: I just checked out your photos and they are very nice! I would suggest going to a class on composition as that will help you very much, as well as (if you are shooting in auto) a class that will help you with manual mode. <br>  <br>  I would suggest you raise your prices just a little bit though. OR remove some of the prints you give with the packages...Just for the session that would be a super price - I charged close to that when i was portfolio building...but It only included the session and post processing...|`|fp9bOiVFaa	You might like the EF 50mm f/1.8 ($100) or the EF 50mm f/1.4 ($450). If you can afford it the EF 17-40mm L would also be great.|`|JXc0O8G9aa	I would also add the 17-85 or 28-135 to replace your kit lens.  Both are pretty decently priced (the 28-135 can be found for $250 US used if you look hard enough) and will allow you to focus much closer than you are with the 75-300.<br>  <br>  If you are looking to eventually replace your telephoto (75-300), I would recommend looking at these...<br>  <br>  70-300 mm f/4.0-5.6 IS USM<br>  70-200 mm f/4 L IS USM<br>  70-200 mm f/2.8 L IS USM<br>  <br>  The 70-200 lenses are a bit more expensive, but the L glass provides unbelievable image quality, and the low constant apertures (especially the 2.8) make these lenses unbeatable for low light situations.<br>  <br>  I can't emphasize enough how much image stabilization improves your image quality at long focal lengths.

1F6KJt0oaa	100 to 400 will give you a nice range.  I like my 70-300 Sigma lens a lot.  You won't need a telextender unless you just really want to destroy your image quality.  No tripods means you will need to use faster shutter speeds with those lenses to avoid camera shake.  You can do it by using higher ISO's or wider apertures which would probably be good for most wild-life anyway.|`|qIR9DB9Haa	100-400 is a great lens with range, although for wildlife, the 400 f/5.6 prime lens is way way sharper and lighter than the 100-400, obviously you loose the range though. I should think that the 18-55 is a fine range for historical sights, unless you really need something wider then its the Tokina 12-24, Sigma 10-20, Canon 10-22 or Tokina 11-16. A good replacement for the 18-55 is the 17-40 L or the 17-55 f/2.8.|`|JXc0O8G9aa	The 100-400 would be nice for wildlife, but if you're looking at photographing historical sites, you'll probably want something wider.  At 100 mm, you'll have to stand WAY back to get an entire scene into frame.<br>  <br>  As far as not being able to use tripods, I would probably look at a lens with image stabilization to help combat image shake in lower light situations.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't bother with a teleconverter with the 100-400 length.  As the other poster said, it will affect your image quality quite a bit.  <br>  <br>  I would recommend the Canon 17-40 mm f/4 L if you're looking at wider landscape shots.  It's a relatively cheap lens (comparatively), especially for the quality you'll get.
PNPqujCTaa	Hi, mr, mr,<br>  <br>  Try accessing the EQ on your vocal track and reducing 400Hz (medium wide bandwidth) by about -9db to -12db.<br>  <br>  That should do it.<br>  db|`|475c01dc76b1f175b986a137414d9e50aa	The key to getting a clear vocal sound is usually by backing off on the low eq a bit.

mfRfxacsaa	A car subwoofer cannot be connected directly to the computer.  The subwoofer must be powered by an amplifier.  You would have to connect an amplifier to your computer and then connect the amplifier's speaker outputs to the subwoofer.  The cables you will need, in addition to an amplifier,  are as follows:<br>  <br>  1. 1/8" stereo phone to RCA stereo (for the PC to amplifier)<br>  2. Speaker Wire (amplifier to the subwoofer)<br>  <br>  You will probably have a hard time finding an amplifier that runs off of household power.  Most home subwoofers include a built-in amplifier.

xkqjtawKaa	You best bet for not so great credit is Sprint. The service isn't too bad, and you can get unlimited everything for $100 a month. The security deposit with them is around $100 - $150. I paid $125. They're one of the cheapest companies to go through. After a year, your deposit gets applied to your bill. I think that's how long most of them take to get your deposit back to you. Just don't try Cingular...they charge a ton for a security deposit.     If you really want Attel, you can try to call their store, and most of the time they are more than happy to help you out.|`|5tT7j4W1aa	This is only for Alltel.

It actually means one million pixels (picture elements). Mega pixel resolution is about potential photo size, not picture quality.<br>  <br>  The following should help you know what to look for in a new camera.<br>  <br>  In new cameras, look for a viewfinder (LCD invisible in bright sun), optical image stabilizer, and check battery prices.  High mega pixel settings take longer to process and may not be needed unless required for very large pictures.  Maximum print size for a 3 mega pixel setting is 8 x 10 inches.

Canon offers the WC-DC52 0.7x wide-angle lens, the TC-DC52A telephoto lens, the 250D 52mm closeup lens separately, along with the LA-DC52G adapter to mount them on the camera.

Use an automatic two or more hour Energizer Compact smart charger with temperature monitor, trickle charge technology, and safety timer ($9.76) at Walmart.  Use pre-charged 2000mAh Duracell ($12.97) or RayOVac ($5.97) batteries (both hold charge one year) and a full cycle charge. To preserve battery charge, use the viewfinder.<br>   <br>  CAUTION   To prevent memory card corruption, keep batteries charged, format in camera, and don't delete or fill card completely.

They gather light and send the information back to the processor that interprets the information and spits out a picture.  1 million pixels is called a Mega Pixel.  Generally speaking the more megapixels you have the larger you can print without distortion.  The lens and the processing are actually far more important to image quality.  There can be Pixel crowding which causes more noise especially in low light. That is when they try to cram too many pixels into too small of a sensor.  It is common with Point and shoots.  Image clarity will depend on the lens, the sensor, and the processing the better you can get each of those the better the camera.|`|MYdD1Zn1aa	Wrong.
