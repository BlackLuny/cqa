The do's would include being accurate in everything you do.  The don't is not to take short cuts in the learning process.  It will only hurt you in the long run.  The best way to get started is to first hook up with a local newspaper and join the sports department.  Work your way up and do some reporting.  While you're doing that go to college and work toward a degree in journalism.  If you're good, and there is no reason to think that you won't be, you'll end up doing exactly want you want.  It worked for me!!!|`|3bf99841d5bf86d183a93f26157dea46aa	Your first option would be to check out SABR (The Society for American Baseball Research),  it'll cost you a fee to join, but they release annual journals and produce a number of pretty cool books and publications.  Some of the articles can get rather esoteric, but overall it's a good way to get a feel for what topics are hot, and what general trends are interesting.<br>  <br>  That's the first thing you should do.|`|5db8a4d79ef1c9ff462987bc954ba65baa	Go to college.  Take classes that study history and past cultures.  Anthropology is a good field.  Put together some interesting research and try to get it published.  Try interning with Major League Baseball or even the Hall of Fame in Cooperstown.  They have a great library there.|`|6a3e6139a57fe7e0e0b4eec6bf88e6dcaa	What a cool job that would be......good luck
817fa97251b90db20c61b1a18d79e2b1aa	i would start cutler i think.  just because cutler looked good last week and had a pretty good game (i thought) in the broncos loss two weeks ago.  plus rivers is in a slump.  he may break out of it no one really knows for sure.  but keep this in mind, with tomlinson being the freak that he is and the chargers D being everything that it is, they don't need big numbers from rivers.  but the broncos need some help from the qb position.  that's why they sat plummer in the first place, he wasn't getting the numbers they needed to be really successful.  sure they were winning, but they needed better numbers if they wanted to keep winning.  so i'd go with cutler.....|`|2eacce68599645ab113dcef2e80394f9aa	Definitly Rivers.Cutler plays the Bengals who look pretty good as of late, & Rivers plays the mediocre Seahawks PLUS the Chargers are on fire this season.|`|d35e33382064124c01a8080f7ea11b45aa	Start of where you end .|`|e7ca4730c616af872ed07e3c8eb6238faa	You should start Phillip Rivers.  Even though Rivers is facing the Seattle defense and Cutler is facing Cinncy's defense. You are best off starting Rivers. He has 2950+ yards 18 TDs and only 8 interceptions. While Cutler has 550+ yards 6 TDs and only 3 interception and he has done that in three weeks.  So you are best off going with Rivers.<br>  <br>  More help...  espn.com|`|AA10130483	Rivers...|`|f371c0dc9701a6e16fcb7e488a7909c8aa	phillip rivers
21758b432f61fc25a0a5bf001ea5fee2aa	Well i for one agree with you. I think Shawn did kill DX, but not intentionally. HBK really messed up everything that DX stood for by not fully partaking in the "Degenerate" storyline. It just wasn't believable because Shawn was Beavis to HHH's Buthead. It was just a shell of what DX used to be. And for those of you who actually got to see it the first time around you know how unpredictable Shawn, Hunter.. and Chyna lol; could be week to week. With Shawn making his religious beliefs known, it took away from not knowing what he was going to do next, because we already knew there's  line he wouldn't cross; which made the "new" DX relatively BORING! So I do agree in some ways with the poster's point.|`|219328603224376ed4f2fddbe0232acbaa	Are you a fool?<br>  <br>  Are you trying to say that HHH's injury isn't real and this is all staged? yeah right.<br>  <br>  Shawn was happy with the direction of DX, he said if he wasn't the one making the sexual quotes besides "suck it", he was fine.<br>  <br>  He and HHH are great friends and most likely DX will be back in full force when Hunter returns.<br>  <br>  Where you got this idea that HBK killed DX, i don't know.|`|7d4cba081658a3d983af242ee5c7b43daa	Have you ever seen Shawn Michaels back then? He was the most extreme, flamboyant, and most vulgared member of DX back then. But now he is a born again Christian, he closed his eyes as a joke to his actual beliefs. And Shawn didn't create that God storyline, that was Vince McMahon's brilliant idea!|`|JNNAp9Dfaa	I HATE YOU!!!<br>  well, for an answer.. the lord is with him all the time and he is expecting him to use the best of his abilities...  well, if ur not down with that, we just got 2 words for ya!<br>  <br>  S'CK IT!!!|`|2eb49b64e603ee2b859ff3b248d444d7aa	he did?! jk...haha  maybe....maybe not...is he catholic or christian?|`|5W7I9TfOaa	What!?Triple H is really hurt.And he's a christian.That's why he covered his eyes in the Women's locker room.DONT TALK ABOUT GOD AGAIN|`|0c3bbab8e426b62009da86d42b336e95aa	Michaels and HHH are going to hit 40 if not already, dx was never going to work.

ymrkxCGdaa	You're like me. I play tennis righty, but do a lot of other things lefty. Bat lefty, play lacrosse lefty, generally prefer to use my left hand instead of my right. Ambidextrous, more or less. As a consequence, I have a fair forehand, but everyone I've played says my backhand is leaps and bounds better than my forehand, because I get great power and spin behind it and can still hit it incredibly accurately.<br>  <br>  So righty batters, I'm assuming, would feel a bit more uncomfortable/in an unnatural position than us two.|`|f1UYyl3Qaa	Yea that would make you have 2 forehands. <br>  <br>  However, dont use this idea, because it'll be like you sharing hand eye coordination, and you switching hands will be very hard to do.

0f213e569404219f01d20decc3749462aa	That'll be very very tough to beat. Is he capable? Sure. At this time, it's hard to say whether he can top that. Duncan is the greatest Power Forward to play the game. LeBron will have to top say a Larry Bird at his position to be considered the greatest Shooting Forward ever. Both of these are tough tasks. Like I said, I think he's very capable. Duncan's resume` is just ridiculously good. The 11x ALL-Defensive Teams is flat out amazing, I don't believe LeBron can touch that.|`|FUoKu13Daa	and people call Duncan a dud, these are amazing stats and Kobe over all stats are not as good as this.<br>  <br>  There are two stats that I am not sure about but the rest I see him getting if he plays long enough,<br>  <br>  #1 NBA championships,  I am not sure he will accomplish 4 but he has a lot of time to get somes and MJ himself was 29 before he got his first and we all know he ended up with 6 and might of got 8 if he did not retire to play baseball.<br>  <br>  #2 is the finals MVP, this one kinda goes with the other one,  If he gets the championships then he will most likely get the finals mvp award.  So let say he does get 4 championships then he will at least get 3 MVP awards,<br>  <br>  But everything else I can see him easily get because he will win In my opinion at least 3 regular season mvp if his teams has the record and the Cavs or New York will do what it takes to give him a good team.<br>  <br>  I do not know if I answer it but I think overall he would have a great legacy and go down as one of the great but I am not sure about 4 championships.|`|qusKbEmBaa	Yes, LeBron is still young not even 25 years of age yet<br>  and hes not even at his prime and he has alot of years<br>  ahead of him tp improve.<br>  He will win a championship<br>  before he retires and atleast 3 MVP awards.<br>  hope i helped<br>  ( I need the points so i was wondering if you can vote me as<br>  best answer, thanks)|`|piZ4xDBqaa	I think the media and the fans will make him out to be greater, even if his accomplishments don't match up.  The hype around LeBron is going to be greater then anything we've seen yet.|`|AA10248312	He'll need to win some titles, obviously.<br>  <br>  And, if he does win some titles, he'll almost certainly be the Finals MVP, so those two will go together for him.<br>  <br>  Provided he stays healthy, Lebron will have no difficulty surpassing Duncan's all star and all-NBA team selections, because Duncan spent four years in college, while Lebron went straight to the NBA from high school.<br>  <br>  The all-defensive team is another matter entirely.  Lebron hasn't done that yet, and it might be tough for him to do so. <br>  <br>  Their legacies will be based in large part on the number of championships they win.  So Lebron's going to have to concentrate on that if he's going to equal Duncan's legacy.  It's one thing to compile great career numbers, as Lebron will certainly do.  It's another thing to win when it counts.|`|AA11416243	Prolly everything but the Championships. I debate this everyday in the barber shop. He is an amazing play but everone needs somebody right. Micheal needed Pippen, Shaq needed Kobe, Wade needed Shaq, Magic needed Kareem and so on. Untill Lebron gets on a team with someone else he wont win the Championship. I say get on another team because I dont see the Cavs go getting what he will need and we saw that this past offseason. <br>  <br>  So to answer your Question- No at the moment|`|a975f0c492ba2ff71d54074b4c858513aa	lol no, sure he been to two finals and yet he has nothing to show for it the media makes soo much excuse for him its laughable when they say he had no gud players around him,yet they went to the final twice u dont jus go to the finals with a crappy team so i think he'll be half of tim duncan if he's lucky.|`|qWI3XBnCaa	It's hard to duplicate those accomplisments...but James will have a good career.|`|bOeNQnBdaa	I doubt it.

XNdDrXAzaa	I think most people aren't very good at evaluating a driver with statistics. Any long time fan of NASCAR would know "it don't work that way" I don't think Junior fans have anything to panic about. And, besides... Junior fans are so hardcore and "true" they wouldn't "panic" even if Junior didn't make the chase. They would still be cheering him on for a win.|`|cKl8ZSrSaa	lol I didn't expect to see this question from you that's for sure. <br>  <br>  However, I wouldn't push the panic button unless any of those drivers are still in that position (or similar one) after the Bristol race in late March. But it's not looking to good, and just one or two more bad finishes will already make it seem like a very long shot for Jr, Burton, or Newman to have a shot at making the chase. We will just have to see what happens this week, first.|`|Q2sZhNmJaa	Not at all he is just getting use to the season.  Like when you warm a car up, sometimes it takes while to warm up but then purrs like a kitten once warmed up.  He'll be puring soon enough, no need to worry.  In addition, stats can change in one race, that is the beauty of them.<br>  Best of luck to Jr this season!|`|aRy2ZvT9aa	Foxfire, where's your Dale Jr loyality, I'm not worried, he is having all his mulligans and crap early get it over with by 'dega and come out strong. He did finish 2nd last yr at Vegas, I'm not worried. His luck can take a turn for the better at any time. I never put to much into qual's anyway. NO PANIC BUTTON, needed at this time. Now if this was 'dega or Lowes. OMG, I need more than a panic button (some stiff drinks). But at this time, I'm not worried yet. I never give up on Dale Jr you know me..<br>  <br>  Go Dale Jr & Hms   NO PAIN BUTTON NEEDED..|`|u4liwDhAaa	Junior will be just fine.  It's to soon to call.

I believe you are correct to not panic yet.|`|bXGwTQy6aa	he's in a great team,i wouldnt panic.....he can rebound pretty easy..|`|YN8Rbjogaa	He better get a move on, and soon. It's easy to make hay early in the season, when there are some drivers who won't make the chase are currently in the top 12. Look at Kyle Busch, who was in the upper 30's after Daytona, and moved into the teens after California. If Junior doesn't make a move up soon, it could spell trouble down the road.|`|YHYT8qMKaa	I wouldn't try to worry just yet. My driver had two DNFs in the first three races last year and still made the chase. Junior has been running well, but he hasn't had the results to show for it. He was running good at Daytona, but had the pit issues. And he started in the back at California and was working his way up to the front when he had the engine failure. As long as he is leading laps and is competitive, I think he still has a chance to get back in the chase.|`|927e8a2fa94732d07566b2526cb8e991aa	Well if you look at both the races this year he has done alright. Just had a few frustrations and bumps in the road. Was doing good on making his way back up to the front before rain came.<br>  <br>  He made his way up to 10th or 9th before the engine troubles came, which is rare for HMS.<br>  <br>  There's one more difference in those stats, He's at HMS now.<br>  <br>  Oh and remember, last year he came close to a win last year at Vegas finishing 2nd. Still excited for this year, we still have 34 races left, and 24 before the chase.|`|85d04bd6c4ca48434a1fe68d2351bddfaa	We're only two races into the season.  It's hardly time to panic.  Year before last Kurt Busch gained over 200 points and worked his way from 18th (I think) to get into the chase in just 4 races.  Dale Jr. may be down right now, but he's far from out.|`|0MuRCU5paa	No because Jr will be doing some bumping at Bristol and Atlanta to get some good finishes. He has a very good chance at making the chase, especially with Hendrick resources.|`|JdJWONkoaa	There's Plenty of time for the drivers mentioned to improve their standings.<br>  It's just a fluke, <br>  Just like M.Waltrip's luck so far this year. <br>  I'm sure things will change.|`|C1gT0pDOaa	My thoughts are it may not be time for the panic button---But Something is wrong--The 2nd weekend in a row that Jr. is the Slowest of the Hendrick Cars!!!!!|`|ZMPvSH7uaa	catfish  likes jr and thinks he will be ok and make the chase.  he is young yet.|`|bTZGob8qaa	It's nowhere near over for him but it is getting a bit hairy.|`|PGlZn1wEaa	No but in 2-3 weeks yes.|`|k4VBpI8yaa	after this weekend yes.i'm a big fan of hms and dale jr but,i think its time for jr to get a new crew cheif.|`|a4LWildhaa	No. Season's young.|`|U3ZBUOWaaa	Naaaaah...he had his mulligans early on.  BUT he has to have just ONE on this Sunday.  or at least come in second to Kyles winning...thats all I ask for. lol|`|mIdcJEJNaa	It will even out.. It always does.. Jr will be just fine..<br>  According to those "in the know" Matt Kenseth did not win<br>  the first two races of the season, it was really Kyle.. lol<br>  Well, they are using words like shoulda' woulda', and coulda',<br>  and even though he's nineteenth in points, they list him third, in the power rankings???? You can't pay attention to people who engage in<br>  that kind of wishful thinking, and excuses..|`|n55igpCUaa	And these two drivers I believe were Tony Stewart and Jimmie Johnson... two drivers that both well exceed Jr's talent. I also am beginning to have my doubts about Burton. Didn't expect Newman to make it anyway.<br>  <br>  ANYHOO... I do not think it's late enough in the season to tell much. Maybe if Jr and Burton are still down in points in about 2 weeks, then we can start to stick a fork in him.|`|RLQdhFWXaa	No, I am not worried yet.  He got his mulligans hopefully out of the way early.  <br>  <br>  Give him 4 weeks or less he will be in the top 12 or close to it.|`|63e6fbd5b85357a27d660c7d5c0b9ee9aa	his luck will change real soon i hope// maybe he will shine at Vegas!!! usually on of his worst tracks<br>  <br>  and there is always first
QBcs78Ntaa	I don't know. I like both. But don't watch either on a regular basis. If i remember its on and i'm not doing anything, i'll turn to it. Usually RAW or Impact. I don't like Smackdown or ECW.|`|gXHxf2G9aa	It seems to be that some fans find it impossible to be loyal to both brands.  I enjoy both TNA and WWE for very different reasons.  WWE has wrestlers that i'm familiar with and have followed for years (Undertaker, Triple H and Randy Orton) and all these men have had some amazing matches.  I enjoy TNA because of the performance that the Knockouts put on.   They are much more hardcore and intense that WWE Diva's in the ring and seem faster too.  Awesome Kong, Taylor Wilde and Christy Hemmy are just amazing and have so much spirit they could entertain for hours.<br>  <br>  So in reply to your question it's a kind of LOVE/HATE relationship...if you love one brand you hate the other....simple as that :)|`|3074it1Qaa	i love WWE and don't really like TNA that much. its like WWE and ECW (before it was purchased by WWE). they r basically rivals in a sense. TNA fans say bad things about WWE because they want to make TNA look better by comparison. a lot of TNA fans r former ECW fans and watch cuz of the hardcore wrestling or cuz it showcases many superstars that r no longer in the WWE like Kurt, Foley, and Booker for example.|`|iMGSaC0qaa	I don't know. I like both. But don't watch either on a regular basis. If i remember its on and i'm not doing anything, i'll turn to it. Usually RAW or Impact. I don't like Smackdown or ECW. <br>  <br>  But I agree. But both are the same though. Some WWE fans bash TNA and vise versa. <br>  <br>  I think TNA needs to fire Don West and Vince Russo. Or they'll never be reconized as a decent alternative to WWE.|`|p6GGoFDsaa	Probably to counteract the insults WWE fans give about TNA.<br>  <br>  Although in fairness, TNA doesn't really deserve any compliments at the moment since they've released a lot of their best talent, and are getting worse and worse every week.|`|srP47FC7aa	Don't know really. I'm a WWE fan through and through and honestly, I will knock TNA and praise the WWE.|`|IkOHh5X8aa	First of all I don't see TNA I see WWE, its because wwe sometimes does not know how to use their superstars and tna gets people who were in wwe and fail to achieve in tna.
QBcs78Ntaa	No not at all. He chose a different career and did what was in his best interest. Just because his decision didn't go over well with the fans doesn't mean he's a "sellout" by any means|`|0TAld46gaa	Not at all<br>  He just did what was better for himself.<br>  <br>  Sounds like you really miss him and want him back<br>  in the WWE. <br>  <br>  He got an opportunity to bring in lots of money<br>  in a career where he has far less risk of getting a serious injury.|`|4tvI9WYjaa	the rock was never a sell out. sure he left the wwe to go to star in movies    but the rock weather you love him or think he is a sell out he was one off the greatest in ring performers off all time.|`|7WmH2Qeqaa	how has he turned his back on the wwe just because he doesn't want to wrestle<br>  <br>  <br>  that is like the people from you old job calling you a sellout because you quit your job and went to a different profession that had nothing to do with the first|`|3074it1Qaa	i hate it when people call people sellouts simply because they wish to pursue other avenues. if thats the case then at least a hundred other superstars would be sellouts as well including some Hall of Famers.|`|OHBvEYKHaa	never|`|444pPdy5aa	yep|`|ICpXv2XDaa	i was the biggest fan of his and can't believe he turned his back on the business. john cena's interview last year was right even though i am a huge cena hater he had a good point. a lot of in ring talent say that this is what i wanted to do all my life and then they get lost with other things such as movies and that is their life. the rock falls in that category and i remember one time he said he will never leave the wwe which was a bunch of bull to me. think about it hasn't been in the wwe ring since 5 years ago, barely came back to induct his pops and grandpa in the hall of fame who knows maybe his mom told him or it would be a dishonor if he wasn't there to do it, he even took out the Rock name out of his character. whenever you see this guy hypothetically speaking you'll say omg that's The Rock hes the wrestler. obviously when the rock here's that nowadays he's ashamed, so now thats why they call him pretty boy Disney-washed Dwayne Johnson. seriously The Rock is what defines him, not Dwayne Johnson.. and the guy above is so right people who watch his movies don't even know the guy used to be an in ring performer, which is in return a disgrace to wwe and its fans for only recognizing him as a movie star and not a wrestler. I really wish he would come back for an in ring promo or one more damn match but he just doesn't give anything back to the fans or the industry that made him become an actor. just think about it if he was only a football player at the University of Miami do you actually think he would become an actor. the wwe creative talent team showed him the way, the fans were there to cheer him or boo him, either way he liked it and now he is some washed up teeny Disney movie making *****. just wait somewhere down the line when theres no more movie deals, he'll come back to kiss Vince's ***|`|AA11302315	I don't think he is a sellout. But I think he is focusing more on "family friendly" entertainment. He was great with WWE but lets face it, the violence and the sexuality is not family friendly. Especially when he is appearing in so many Disney movies and shows ( The Game Plan, Witch Mountain, Wizards of Waverly Place, Hannaha Montana and so on...).|`|srP47FC7aa	No not at all. He chose a different career and did what was in his best interest. Just because his decision didn't go over well with the fans doesn't mean he's a "sellout" by any means. The guy dedicated many years to his profession and had an amazing run. He's moved on to bigger and better things and found his other profession and mastered it. Just let the scenario be.|`|1JywgkyMaa	yes without a doubt,last time he was even in a wrestling ring was 2004,if they were gonna induct him into the hall of fame he probably say,why do that when i can make another movie,i'll bet that people that have watched his movies dont even know he used to be a wrestler|`|AA11435718	Well didn't the Crock I mean the Rock play football before wrestle so maybe he just out for the MONEY or the frist 2 were 2 hard on him|`|QbY18bjkaa	No.....<br>  <br>  The rock gave us many memories to feed upon <br>  <br>  sell out nah <br>  <br>  but ah return at wm25 would be great.|`|lRSLi6REaa	no|`|ojetVlE9aa	the rock diddnt play in the NFL, not even the CFL.... or Arena! But i think maybe there is a difference between a guy who wrestles and a wrestler. the rock heritage put aside maybe the latter. I have negative feelings about him leaving, i feel like it was a stolen investment, but i main problem now is him trying to plug movies at the end of Raw under his real name. Its just too much right there. Who is Dwayne Johnson?|`|qwdh7N6saa	THE ROCK will all wants be the peoples Campion|`|MFFYPdhVaa	YES HE IS
QBcs78Ntaa	People like to feel superior about themselves. They like to think that because they sit back and think of wrestling as 'pure' and they watch it for the mat skills, that they somehow enjoy it more than the rest of us who watch it to be entertained|`|UWJinEbIaa	If they don't buy tickets, merchandise, videos, etc.....they don't matter.|`|8t1Osybyaa	cena fans matter just like all the other fans|`|5xIroQjMaa	People like to feel superior about themselves. They like to think that because they sit back and think of wrestling as 'pure' and they watch it for the mat skills, that they somehow enjoy it more than the rest of us who watch it to be entertained. It's a stupid idea, since everything is scripted, and the only thing that matters is how many people are entertained by what they watch. And Cena does that as good as anyone currently in the business.|`|srP47FC7aa	Don't listen to the criticism.|`|1JywgkyMaa	there are 3 types of people on earth that like cena,little kids,women,wwe marks that know nothing about wrestling|`|IkOHh5X8aa	Because John Cena is not the type of wrestler people are used to, he is especially made for the young people like me, he is my favorite wrestler anyway|`|yl86ZQ6Daa	John Cena fans do matter, don't listen to them!

PjCK7zj6aa	Por una parte es de todos conocido que el dominio del ITESM se debe a las lagunas existentes o a la mala aplicacion de los reglamentos en la ONEFA, sin embargo creo que para ser el "mejor"  se debe de competir contra los mejores , por ello creo que la Universidad y el IPN se tendrian que haber mantenido con la motivacion de ganar algun dia la tan dispareja batalla|`|8Cnwak9paa	me parece bien por que los otros equipos no son tan buenos o no estan al nivel|`|8iwKFz82aa	Me parece bien la división de la conferencia, pues como es de todos conocidos, los equipos del sistema ITESM son poseedores de la mayoria del activo de jugadores que terminan su elegibilidad en los equipos de FADEMAC, CONAJUVE y demás ligas que integran el sistema de football americano de México, ofreciendoles becas para estudiar (sin importar que promedio tengan, con que sean buenos jugadores la mantienen), facilidades de vivienda (departamentos cerca de las instituciones, o bien casas-estudiante dentro de las mismas instituciones) y es asi como jugadores con futuro prometedor en instituciones como aguilas blancas, pumitas, tigres, cougars, pieles rojas, politos y demás equipos que sustentan a las maximas casas de estudios del país, terminan emigrando a dichas instituciones. En respuesta a aleps_99, me parecería correcto que te informases antes hacer algún comentario acerca de cualquiera tema, tienes razón la UANL es una universidad pública, pero ?alguna vez haz visto las cuotas que hay que pagar para inscripcion y tener derecho a estudiar en dicha escuela?, creo que deberías de hacer una comparación entre los 25 centavos que pagan los universitarios con los 2,600 pesos que se pagan en la UANL, existe un amplio margen entre ambas cifras para jovenes que sus papas tienen un ingreso del salario minimo (o menor) y aún así estan ahi por lo que representa estar en dicha institución, creo que deberias de investigar un poquito siempre que vayas a hacer algun comentario, de lo contrario podrian considerarte ignorante, y te lo digo pues, en este caso es del dominio popular que la UANL es pública pero con una cuota muy elevada. <br>  Saludos|`|d5eIB7eDaa	pues por una parte el nivel de juego va a mejorar ya no abra tantos partidos tan disparejos pero si se me hace una postura de comodidad de parte de los equipos de la conferencia central|`|wI6ekYbqaa	Una autentica pena.<br>  <br>  Y lo peor es que quien queda peor, por la forma en que propusieron la división de la liga son las UNAM y el Poli, y eso empeora la situación.<br>  <br>  Una de las razones para que diga esto, que en la conferencia de los 6 grandes se quedaron lso Tigres de la UANL, perdon pero que no la UANL es una universidad pública???<br>  <br>  La Autonoma de Nuevo Leon no tiene ni de cerca la misma cantidad de estudiantes que la UNAM o el poli, de hecho no dudo que haya facultades de la UNAM con mas alumnos que toda la autonoma, entonces por que dejaron a los Tigres con las privadas???<br>  <br>  La razón del éxito de los Tigres es por que hacen su chamba, el rector esta comprometido con el desarrollo deportivo de los alumnos, buscan patrocinios, apoyos economicos y hay compromiso entre las autoridades por impulsar el deporte.<br>  <br>  Esto solo demuestra algo que ya tenia mucho tiempo diciendo, el apoyo de las autoridades del Poli y la UNAM a su futbol americano es inconmesurable (de tan peque?o que no se puede medir), invaluable (de inexistente), dedicado (para que desaparezca).<br>  <br>  Una pena, y mas por que en la mediocridad de la propuesta, los Pumas y las Aguilas Blancas renunciaron al título nacional.|`|JZk8tcTmaa	Me acabo de enterar y la verdad me asombra, en un deporte que un equipo el itesm campus mty lleva 12 a?os seguidos llegando a una final... sin palabras el equipo mas dominador de  Mexico en cualquier deporte, que las demas universidades no pueden competir contra los itesm y escuelas de paga...lo considero muy burdo miren a la uanl se ha mantenido, 3 finales en los ultimos 6 a?os<br>  <br>  Creo que es una salida facil de esas escuelas para poder ganar algo que no lo pueden hacer en el campo de juego, es lamentable que en el siglo 21 existas ahora una ruptura y centralismo... asi se llama la conferencia ( conferencia central)<br>  <br>  Lo considero una salida facil, en vez de encarar el reto|`|7fb3bb36230eb1de01bf2fe6e20b8cd3aa	ACERTADA POR EL MOMENTO,YA QUE LAS ESCUELAS PARTICULARES(LAS DEL TEC DE MONTERREY Y LA UDLA) REALMENTE JUEGAN CON MUCHAS PREBENDAS,YA QUE SON EQUIPOS CASI SUB-PROFESIONALES, LES PAGAN BECAS A LOS JUGADORES(pago de colegiatura, pago de alimentos y vivienda,gastos,etc.)QUE LAS INSTITUCIONES OFICIALES NO LE PUEDEN PAGAR A SUS JUGADORES,POR ESO  SE ENCUENTRA EN LA LISTA DEL TEC O DE LA U DE LAS AMERICAS MUCHOS EX-JUGADORES DE PUMITAS,POLITOS O DE INTERMEDIA DEL POLI O LA UNAM, PUES SE LOS LLEVAN CON ESAS "BECOTAS". SIN EMBARGO SI ALGUN DIA SE DA QUE LAS INSTITUCIONES OFICIALES PUEDAN PAGAR ESAS BECAS ,ENTONCES YA VEREMOS UN NIVEL MAS PAREJO,Y LOS EQUIPOS QUE DESDE INFANTIL FUERON PREPARANDO A SUS JUGADORES PUEDAN CONSERVARLOS.|`|CAoAB3fOaa	no me gusta mucho el golf jeje|`|h673I53Xaa	tendra mayor exito la conferencia central puesto que estan los equipos de que mas arrastran aficion, me refiero a los representativos de las mejores escuelas publicas de mexico osea UNAM e IPN.|`|l7FYQ2fUaa	Les conviene a los de la conferencia central porque sólo así podrán ganar algún campeonato (mientras más alejados de los borregos, mejor)

Our Defense is still good, we just lost a Leader. I'll miss Dawkins, but Its time to move on. I kind of saw him going to another team.

AA10343094	20% is perfectly healthy. if you go below 15%, chances are you're going to be very sickly and not able to run at all. i'm going to give you a link to a bmi calculator, and it will tell you what a healthy bmi is, and why. i wouldn't reccommend trying to get down to 2-3%, because you will have serious health risks, and your organs will begin to shut down.|`|xb0Jidr1aa	rhay, the asker didn't mean that they wanted to decrease there bmi to 2%-3%, they meant that they wanted to decrease their bmi BY 2%-3%, bringing their bmi down to about 17%-18%.<br>  <br>  Anyways if running hasn't slimed your waist down I'm not sure what will help.|`|s2w7dxi6aa	Do Planks!! If you dont know what they are look it up on google and find out. If you want to burn the fat on the side of your torso then side planks will do that. Usually the best exercises for abs are floor exercises that dont require any equipment. Dont buy an ab roller swing or whatever and think your going to get ripped in a week. And if you want to burn more fat with your running try doing some speed drills once a week. running fast for short distances(200m,400m) will burn fat a lot faster than jogging around the block at a 10 min pace.

ClQ9yJweaa	Im thinking Oklahoma or NC. I want UConn, but wont happen. Blake Griffin, well Oklahoma doesnt fair too well without him and is a huge presence for that team. Same could be said with Hansbrough and NC. Dont under estimate Pitt though.|`|v5MP0KJ8aa	I think UNC will win. If they get beat in the NCAA tournament, it will be by an ACC team. I don't think Pitt, UConn or any other Non-ACC team is ready for the offense that Carolina brings. Just ask Michigan State(UNC98-MSU65) and Notre Dame(UNC102-ND87). ACC teams are use to it. Pitt doesn't really have a defensive stopper inside. Blair is mainly offense. Hansbrough will get him and the other big men in foul trouble and they don't have a guard that can slow down Ty Lawson. As for UConn, they don't have enough weapons on offense. That's why Pitt has owned them this year. They can't rely on AJ Price to score 36 points every game. Oklahoma might have an outside chance but Griffin has to stay healthy and out of foul trouble. Louisville could cause some matchup problems for UNC but I think UNC would still beat them. Tarheels will be the champs.|`|F05yVezraa	UNC or Kansas|`|zsxK8O5Uaa	Unc!|`|596ba0725523b654ae88f9a7d31dae51aa	Pitt is hot, just beat UConn.|`|hpxc5szsaa	duke or texas...maryland state sucks some big *** dick...LOL|`|6768c11da3a7523681b339d4d16ff8b6aa	This will be Pitt's year.

As Athletic Director of the YMCA Training School, he had been tasked with inventing an indoor game to keep rowdy athletes busy during the winter season. <br>  He took a soccer ball and a peach basket into the gym and invented basketball.|`|PrJVvd4zaa	The first basketballs and stuff where made out of animal blatters,before there were 11 cities, yep =)|`|37Mq8ouIaa	1891|`|0ytjj1EGaa	james Naismith invented basketball in 1891<br>  <br>  At Springfield YMCA,

jLM4Yo32aa	Dwight Howard, Chris Paul, Kobe...|`|AA11455646	Actually there are a lot of role models in the NBA<br>  <br>  10) Dwayne Wade- Miami Heat<br>   9) Shaq O'Neal- Phoenix Suns<br>   8) TJ Ford- Indiana Pacers<br>   7) Dikembi Matumbo- I think still with the Rockets<br>   6) Michael Redd- Milwaukee Bucks<br>   5) Carlos Boozer- Utah Jazz<br>   4) Chris Bosh- Toronto Raptors<br>   3) Luke Ridnour- Milwaukee Bucks<br>   2) Tim Duncan- San Antonio Spurs<br>   1) Grant Hill- Phoenix Suns<br>  <br>  All of these players go out of their way to make the game pleasent.  With a lot of players thinking they are thugs, it is nice to see players who respect the game and take on the role of role model.|`|eNq3DOWmaa	just to let you know hes asking who the best role model is not who your favorite player is...i mean kobe is sort of a role model but not really because he is at times..a ball hog..so think before you answer..i gave a thumbs up to tim duncan though and dwight howard tim duncan is respetced by just about everybody and dwight howard..has a good sense of humor and loves to have fun and not get into fights like everyone else|`|Jbsawmr9aa	This depends on what kind of role model?  Are we looking for people who are great examples on, or off the court?  Or a combination?<br>  <br>  On the Court...<br>  <br>  good choice - Dwayne Wade.  He is a hard worker who isn't afraid to do what needs to be done on the court.  <br>  <br>  bad choice - Tim Duncan.  Sorry folks but the guy is a cry baby, If he deson't score everytime he tries, he must have been fouled.  Although I would never pick Shaq, Tim needs to just play the game (like shaq did in the late 90's and early 2000)  The guy got fouled on every play, but never complained about it.<br>  <br>  Off the court - <br>  <br>  good choice - Tim Duncan (took the place of Alonzo Mourning).  The guy is a great person like the previous answer said, he cares about the community and his image within the community.  He recognizes that he is a role model and embraces the role.  Zo used to be one of the best guys in the league off the court (on the court he was an animal).  <br>  <br>  Bad choice - LBJ, I don't think this is entirely his fault, he is being portrayed as the face of the NBA for the next 10 years and I think this makes him seem unapproachable.  If you look at the other big star from his draft class (DWade...I put those two a notch above Melo and Bosh) Dwade seems much more down to earth and humble.  Which I attribute to marketing.  LBJ is in all these arrogant commercials, then you got Dwade who is on air begging Barkley to be in his fav 5 for t-mobile.|`|0yljkLGeaa	Dikembe Mutombo is the best role model, he always extend him hands to those who in need <br>  <br>  <br>  then Carmelo Anthony he might be stereotyped as Gangster, a Thug but he loves kids and cares for them. i'm not so sure how many charities he have?<br>  a very melo christmas, brooklyn annual 3 on 3 to name a few|`|PcW3TDX1aa	good question.<br>  personally, i like steve nash.  he's unselfish, accepts responsibility for losses, is a leader on the floor and the locker room, and isn't afraid to speak out on world issues (such as war and the environment).|`|zg1lIy7Oaa	Grant Hill is the best role model in the NBA. He is the only two-time recipient of the NBA Sportmanship Award (2004-05 with Orlando Magic and 2007-08 with Phoenix Suns).|`|w8AFCj5xaa	Tim Duncan|`|eIsaihWBaa	That is a very tough question. But after thinking hard I feel it is definitely Ben Wallace.<br>  <br>  Ben Wallace is the perfect example of a determined, hard working man. He went to junior college and then transfered to Virginia Union, division II.<br>  <br>  He stayed determined to play basketball at the highest level he could. He is one of a very select few who came from division II and become an allstar.<br>  <br>  Also, he recieved a college degree. I think that is a good example to lead, because basketball isnt going anywhere but getting a thorough education will leave you with a backup play for after basketball is no longer an option.<br>  <br>  Finally, he has never had any legal trouble during his college and NBA career. And his record with the league is completely clean besides a couple tiny blemishes.<br>  <br>  Ben Wallace is a hard worker, a determined man, and the epitome of a good role model in the NBA.|`|GY3QTszgaa	POSITIVE ROLE MODEL<br>  dirk nowitzki- the man is a great and kind hearted guy. he is the most humble and down to earth superstar and treats media, fans like the way people should be treated. he visits hospitals to cheer up the sick 24/7. he also visits the kids that are ill and want a wish. HE IS A GREAT PERSON!!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  NEGATIVE ROLE MODEL FOR THUGS/ LOW LIFE'S<br>  shaq and zack randolph. they gets into other players faces and intimidates them. they pick fights with people all the time. zack punched louis amudson in the face. shaq tried to punch barkley. shaq this past week and summer picked fights with bosh, vangundy, and asked kobe how his butt taste in a song ment to rub in the fact that kobe didnt win a ring without him. these are great role models for thugs and low lifes|`|Ct6NMwwjaa	Grant hill has won a lot of the sportsmanship awards,<br>  <br>  personally i think is tim duncun never see him angry|`|77JCSkRGaa	Dikembe Mutumbo|`|37Mq8ouIaa	Derek Fisher.|`|GswnLKtQaa	Grant Hill|`|qusKbEmBaa	Robert Horry, with more than 5 NBA championship<br>  rings, he also works alot with the community and he is<br>  noticed and he should be a hall of famer.<br>  hope i helped<br>  ( I need the points so i was wondering if you can vote me as<br>  best answer, thanks)|`|cmwg0YTFaa	4 time champion Tim Duncan<br>  <br>  For every home game he pays the bill for 50 kids;they get<br>  <br>  -ticket to the game<br>  -t-shirt with phrase "Character Counts"<br>  -hot dog<br>  -soda<br>  <br>  Every home game! 50 kids!

jLM4Yo32aa	They have a chance, and i think they will win it.<br>  Go Orlando!|`|GY3QTszgaa	NO! they will not make it out the eastern conference because they cant beat boston or cleveland in the east finals. they may not even go far if they meet the pistons in the 1st rd because they dont match up well with the pistons and the pistons have their number. i think they'll make the semi's but not the east finals if they run into cleveland or boston 1st.|`|ClQ9yJweaa	I certainly do. Said it all along, all season, and often get slammed for my thought lol.   This team is extremely well balanced, and kind of reminds me of an Eastern version of my Spurs. Maybe thats why Magic are my 2nd favorite team and am hoping both go to The Finals, though probably wont happen. I do see magic with a great chance to come out of the East. Boston, as good as it is, is quite inconsistent, and Cavs, well, Im still not convinced. Magic could beat Cavs in 7, surely, as well as Celtics, and possibly even 5-6. Dwight Howard is just awesome, and a fav of mine but behind Duncan =).|`|37Mq8ouIaa	yes they can but it's the Lakers who will be champs this year.|`|StteR9KHaa	I they are all healthy they can make it to the conference finals|`|eNq3DOWmaa	they have a chance but this year is not their year..sorry|`|QedjRGpHaa	Yes, they have a chance.|`|GswnLKtQaa	Magic are title contenders this year, they have a chance.|`|BTZ4vFKJaa	they have a slim chance.|`|AA10958272	The win over the Celts was enough to give you the idea that they "can" (as a fan, of course!) -- but, not without some extreme good fortune. Winning 1 game is one thing, winning a series is another. The CAVS and Celtics are strong, and have a bench -- unlike the Magic. Howard is fantastic, but the Celts especially when healthy can overwhelm him with what they have going on, all around and inside/outside. The Magic don't have the playoff team, this year to represent at that level -- and will NOT win it all, vs. the West.. even if the Celts & Cavs break down or batter each other down the stretch (trying to get the #1 seed).|`|qusKbEmBaa	Yes, they are contenders and the way Dwight Howard is player<br>  this year I think they has a very high chance of winning<br>  it all. The Celtics and Cavs are way overrated. <br>  Hope i helped<br>  ( I need the points so i was wondering if you can vote me as<br>  best answer, thanks)|`|F05yVezraa	they got a chance but I think the cavs will win it all|`|Cy2pwXzzaa	they really don't have a realistic chance... too soft inside

But he is not worth $100 million; including 41 million guaranteed. The guy has had two good seasons; both when he was in his contract year and about to cash in.<br>  <br>  He doesn't have to worry about that anymore. If I was a Redskins fan, I would be a little worried about whether or not this was a wise investment.|`|cdQryr7paa	The Redskins have brought in a ton of high priced players over the last 10 years and it hasn't done them any good.<br>  It's one thing to pay a ton of money for good players, but it's another to get those players to play good together.<br>  Look over the history of the Redskins and all the players they have brought it.<br>  They just can't find the combination of players to make it work on a championship level.<br>  What they need to do is stop overspending on free agents and use the draft to find good young and hungry talent.<br>  We will see what happens, but I see the Redskins underachieving as usual next season.|`|VXQFT341aa	Not with that owner. When will these owners learn you can't by a championship. Since these players got the money, on field production will diminish.|`|RB9Y8p8Yaa	no they are probably not going to makr the playoffs, Haynesworth is not going to make as huge as of imapct as he did with the titans|`|1i9mrq5Yaa	lmao<br>  ahahahajhah<br>  just bc they sign 2 more players there gonna win?<br>  give me a ***** break

He claims he has a fractured knee, but has not produced the evidence, like MRI images, to prove it.<br>  <br>  If that what is really going on, he's gone, and the team has no choice in the matter.  Otherwise, any player who didin't want to play through some nagging pain, could do the same.|`|YhfMrppSaa	He is hurt right now<br>  <br>  <br>  He might be traded at offseason stay tune at espn or if u dont have espn then stay tune on espn.com|`|PrRNMDXRaa	Nobody knows just yet, he still has 21 million dollars left on his contract.

R0NfdgzLaa	it's a difficult question, because 'balls faced' wasn't recorded as a statistic until about 40 years ago.<br>  <br>  here's some interesting facts i found:<br>  william scotton, circa 1870s, carried his bat through a first class innings, and made 9*.<br>  in the 1950s, trevor bailey made 68 in 458 minutes (almost 8 hours).  then in the same match jim burke made 28 in 250 minutes (over 4 hours). <br>  <br>  the scoring rate has lifted so much over the years that some of the old school players who didn't score as many runs as the players you've mentioned would probably figure in the most balls faced, although nobody knows, because it wasn't recorded.  strike rates of 30 or less were common enough even in the 1970s, imagine back in the day when test matches weren't under a five day limit.  some of the old stonewallers probably faced as many balls as allan border or tendulkar, but scored a quarter of the runs... or even less.|`|AA11088802	sachin|`|gz2M5hsBaa	I think it would be Sunil Gavaskar (10122 runs). He was a slow batsman, not as slow as Boycott, but the extra 2000 runs makes me think he would have faced more balls than him.|`|2Gz6pVbKaa	Dravid and Kallis both scored 10000 runs and both very slow scores they would have faced most of current players. In Gavaskar, Boycott etc they had 8 ball overs and the over rates were pretty quick so my guess is Sunni or Boycott.|`|6wGrCC3Iaa	I think it is Allan Border because he played the most matches.

FhHIAbmLaa	Here are the facts. You choose. <br>  <br>  The 45 is a larger caliber that makes a bigger wound, and drives deeper due to sheer weight. It is usually twice the weight of a 9 mm.<br>  <br>  The 9mm is a light bullet that drives deep due to speed. <br>  <br>  In a light carry gun, the 45 holds 7 to 10 rounds, and is heavy with anymore. <br>  <br>  A 9mm can hold 12 to 15 and still be lighter than a 45 with 8. <br>  <br>  A 45ACP has 98 years of combat testing. It is still used in spec op groups in out military. Most SWAT teams use the .45 over all other calibers, and it is a crushing weapon in a sub gun. A 45 caliber colt was designed in the 1870,s and is still a huge seller in the revolver market. It was such a manstopper that that is why John Moses Browning chose the .45 to make an Auto with back in the early 1900,s<br>  <br>  <br>  In WW2, Germans often surrendered to forces of much fewer numbers because they heard the Thompson sub machine gun, and feared its accuracy and power.<br>  <br>  I am a police officer and have seen many gunshot wounds. It is often hard to tell the difference between a 9mm, a 38, or a 32; they all look the same. A 45 stands out, and is often unsurvivable if anywhere in the torso. <br>  <br>  Most civilian engagements occur within 5 feet, with an average of 3 shots fired. So why worry about a 19 round Magazine. <br>  <br>  I own 9mms, and am damn good with them. I also carry on duty a Smith and Wesson .M&P .40, and am damn good with it too. <br>  <br>  I carry a .45 1911 off duty. Shot for shot, it still is the best man-stopper on the market.(NOT THE 357)The 9mm is no slouch either, but facts are facts. Its been around for over 100 years.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|Ucbnl7VJaa	The .45 ACP and 9mm Luger/Parabellum/9x19mm NATO can pretty much do the same things. A .45 in theory has a small and possibly significant edge in stopping power with a single shot. However in real life combat a double-tap to center chest with either has the same real effect if both are loaded with high performance ammo. Plus it's easier to get fast accurate follow up shots with the 9mm then the .45 even after extensive practice. <br>  <br>  For competition the 9mm is a better choice for the same lower recoil, faster recovery edge unless to be competitive in class you have the momentum or "power factor" of the .45. The 9mm is fully equal in accuracy potential to the .45 but match-grade factory loaded ammunition is a bit harder to find.  On target it just cuts a smaller hole so you have about .048" less of a chance to cut the next scoring ring on a "miss".<br>  <br>  Choose based not on the chambering but on what you feel handles and fits you best. if you find a design that fits you in both chamberings or multiple designs in one or the other that's when to decide on the 9mm or .45.|`|ewbuVeTTaa	Both can and have killed people with one shot. As one who owns pistols in both calibers, both have their strong points. .45 has the advantage of being bigger, slower and impacting more energy.  9mm has the strength of higher capacity, more economical to buy and practice with. It would depend on what is more important to you. More rounds, or larger bullets and more energy. .45s do have the weakness of having more kick to for some people, and not as many high capacity applications as the 9mm has and also they have the weakness of being more expensive than 9mm ammunition is.  <br>  <br>  9mm has the weakness of sometimes not stopping a threat immediately with one shot, and some reputation of not being enough gun for some people and being too fast to do any signifigant damage to tissue. <br>  <br>  Both sides of that fence have their solutions, yes, there are high capacity .45s that nullify the 9mm's advantage of capacity, the Springfield XD45, the Glock 21, the HK USP series, the Para-Ordanance P14 to name a few. <br>  <br>  On the 9mm side to the stopping power part, there is ammuniton out there that can and have stopped assailants quickly and consistently, the Federal Hydra-Shok rounds in 115 and 124 grain weight as well as  standard pressure, +P, and +P+ loadings,  the Speer Gold Dot in  124, 135 and 147 grain weights in the standard pressure, +P, and +P+ is another, The Winchester Ranger SXT family also is a good choice. There are no doubt others as well.  Yes, some of those are marketed to law enforcement, but there is no law saying one cannot buy that ammo through third parties.<br>  <br>  <br>  Both the 9mm and .45 ACP are battle tested, war tested rounds. Both have been around since before WWI, used in WWI, WWII, and countless other conflicts and both filled their share of graves, offensively.  They are both still around for one reason and one reason only: They work and they work well.   <br>  <br>  I couldn't decide which I wanted, so I got both.  I carry a S&W 910 9mm with Gold Dot 124 grain +P outside the house and leave a Glock 21 with .45 ACP 230 grain Hydra Shoks at home for defending the house along with others. <br>  <br>  You would be far from defenseless with either.|`|OYy1OmDPaa	Better for what?  Since you don't specify I'll pick neither, since both have been surpassed in all measures (except cost) by modern higher pressure rounds.<br>  <br>  However, there are no magic calibers available in easily worn/concealable handguns.  The best is the 10mm, but even it offers only 20% of common deer rifle energy.|`|3b8557f01cef58611c2e78e57d57b1e5aa	The Better one is the 45acp, but the Best Choice for a self-defense caliber that has been tried, true, tested, and proven to be the Best One (1) shot Man Stopper is the 357 Magnum.* Using the 125 grain jacketed hollow point bullet.*|`|sVDpZjiKaa	dude, no military pistol in the world has more service ribbons than the 45 ACP.  9mm is great if you're a cop and afraid to actually kill somebody...<br>  <br>  and everybody knows a 45 looks like a 45 and fear and respect it.|`|8ivnzNi5aa	Whichever you have in your hand when you need it.  The 9mms became popular because of their high magazine capacities compared to .45's and revolvers.  There is at least one .45 available which has the high capacity of most nines, but with a more potent round.  That's the Para-Ordnance P14.45.  It's a 14-shot .45 which functions just like the classic 1911 series.   That's just a point to ponder.|`|YrxLbfiIaa	Better?...........<br>  <br>  Both and neither...............<br>  <br>  For stopping power the .45 of course....<br>  <br>  On the other hand if you do a lot of target practice the 9MM is most cost effective... .45 Ammo is expensive while 9MM can be had in bulk at many Walmarts for $18.95 for 100 cartridges.....|`|6KaMW1Vzaa	If you can shoot the 45 ACP, it's a better defensive round. But a large-bore miss isn't as effective as a small-bore hit.<br>  Modern bullet technology has gotten the 9 to a point at which it may do nearly as well, but the fact remains that while a good 9mm bullet is probably going to expand well, there's no way a 45 ball is going to shrink on its way to the target.|`|CFm0u13Paa	Which is better depends on your intended use. <br>  <br>  Some people think that the .45 has more stopping power but, in reality, its only a hair better than the 9mm when both are used with modern hollow point ammo. There is a significant difference when they are used with ball ammo. <br>  <br>  As we all know, shot placement is far more important than caliber and most people will shoot better with the 9mm due to its considerably lower recoil. Also, the fact that .45 ammo costs about 50% more than 9mm ammo means less practice for the same money. <br>  <br>  Some people like the .357 Sig and .45 GAP but these may not be around too long. The .40SW is one of the few "new" calibers that has made it into the big time and become a "standard". Most "new" calibers fade away are are very hard to come by like the .41Mag, 10mm, and .38Super. The .357Sig is a nice load but its increased performance does not justify its premium price. Likewise, the .45GAP has nothing on the .45ACP but it costs considerable more and is much harder to come by. <br>  <br>  I like to stick with "standard" calibers like .38Special, .357Mag, 9mm, and .45ACP because they are very popular which means that they are available almost anywhere and are usually available in a wider selection of loadings. They are also considerably less expensive than the "new" calibers. <br>  <br>  One local store here has one type of .45Gap ammo in stock and the owner says he hasn't sold a box of it in over two years. He also has only one type of .357Sig ammo, but he has 9 different .38 loads, 4 .357 loads, and 6 9mm loads in stock. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  .|`|AA10240928	45 ACP is the better cartridge.  It will reliably make at least a .45 inch hole everytime.  It is an inherently accurate cartridge.  It's loaded to relatively low pressures.  It strikes the perfect balance between delivering a big and heavy bullet at just enough speed so as not to create too much recoil.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  I should add that I love the 9mm, but the 45 ACP is the better cartridge IMO.|`|kQSSz2X2aa	You have opened up an extra-large sized can of worms known as the caliber wars. Once people are set on a particular caliber (9mm and .45 ACP have very devoted followings) they dig their heels in and will fight to the death over which is better (okay, so I exaggerate a little, but not much). <br>  <br>  It's personal preference. The best caliber is the one that works for you and the one that you like.

It may seem pretty pricey, but if you make at least 20 of these things its very well wort the cost. <br>  after widening the hole you make a tiny paper funnel and fill the cartridge nearly full with gun powder. insert the Estes electric fuse with insulation around the two wires. seal with hot glue. to set one off you will need to connect it to a battery between 9 and 24 volts, between you will need a really long wire (you can get a 50 foot speaker type wire for $10 at ace hardware).<br>  Its very loud and very powerful, if you stick one of those in a water jug filled with water your blast can be amplified enough to rattle windows up to 500 feet away. <br>  <br>  alternatively use blackpowder or flash powder as the filling and then you can use a regular fuse. for safety I recommend at least a 5 to 11 second fuse and you do not try throwing those. Cannonfuse.com has all the fuses you need, I generally use 1/8" cannon waterproof fuse since it always works and is waterproof. <br>  <br>  and don't screw around playing with these, using your NOS powershot bottle as the container would make a loud bang, if you where too close your ears would ring. If you were too close to these you'll wake up finding yourself in the hospital.|`|TPZwmQK9aa	You want to fill it no more than 2/3 full so there is plenty of oxygen inside.

In other words, it will be freakin' loud.  It will also throw plastic "shrapnel", so you need to be 50' away at absolute minimum.<br>  This should do a nice job on a microwave.  Be aware that if you are caught with one, you are going to prison for bomb manufacturing.  In order to minimize your risk, carry the empty containers out there in the car, and either have someone else take the black powder and fuse, or make a second trip.<br>  If you are caught with a bunch of empty containers, powder, and fuse (bomb-making materials) together in a vehicle, you're looking at a felony conviction.|`|OYy1OmDPaa	Stick with commercially available fireworks.<br>  <br>  Black powder must be confined to explode instead of burn.

wPlfPc0gaa	There is no question in ODI's as Tendulkar is way ahead of Ponting. Tendulkar is handy with the ball as well. I remember an ODI where Sachin failed with the bat against the Aussies but took 5 wickets to take the team to victory.<br>    <br>  But in tests, the story is quite different. Statistically, Ricky is ahead of Sachin. That prompts some other analysis. During most part of SRT's career, the team depended on him to score big runs. But it is only recently that RTP was looked upon as the principal scorer of the team. He played alongside good players like Mark Taylor, the Waugh brothers, etc in the early part of his career. Even after he assumed captaincy, there were likes of Hayden, Langer, Martyn, Gilchrist who can score regularly and the pressure on Ponting was relatively less. On the other hand, SRT had only Dravid on his side, who can score consistently. There were other players like Ganguly, who was a good captain but who failed to make big scores in test too often.<br>  Statistically, SRT & RTP are too close.<br>  When their respective teams won, the batting averages are<br>  SRT - 63.76<br>  RTP - 62.23<br>  In drawn matches<br>  SRT - 65.87<br>  RTP - 59.68<br>  In losses<br>  SRT - 36.29<br>  RTP - 38.35<br>  Sachin highest score when India lost a test match is 177. But Australia lost a test when Ponting made 242.<br>  And it is also known to the cricket world that Australia until recently were the most dominating team in the world, and India were strugglers. Things have changed a little now and we have seen how the pressure is on the Aussies and how Ponting has to struggle to score runs and failing to convert his starts to big scores, especially when the team had their back against the wall.<br>  I'll have to conclude that Ponting has been involved in more test wins than Tendulkar, because Ponting played for Australia. If we do a role reversal, and Sachin played for Australia and Ponting for India, Sachin would have crossed 20000 test runs by now  and Ponting would have been somewhere near 7500 test runs. Hypothetically.|`|IxQzS9SEaa	If you take the India's Greatest Series Winnings, the following will be there.<br>  <br>  1.Sharjah Cup, 1998<br>  2.CB Series Win, 2007-8<br>  3.First ODI Series Win in NZ,2009(Going on)<br>  <br>  Sachin is the Key player in all the Series.<br>  <br>  Don't Forget about the World Cups 1996 and 2003. Both Series he was the Highest Run Getter. He single handedly  brought India to Finals of 2003 after India lost to Australia in League Match. All the India asked the team to return without any further matches. After Sachin's Interview the whole nation calmed down. He took India to the finals. Moreover he has got three scores above 150 in oDI's which is equaled by only Lara(3), Viv Richards(3), Gayle(3) and Jayasurya(4). Above all ponting has no pressure on field to perform. But Sachin has a burden of 100crore people's expectation on his back whenever he is at crease. Everyone expects him to score century in every match. <br>  <br>  In tests, however Ponting comes in front but very small amount.In simple, Ponting is one of the brave soldier in a greatest army. Sachin is the bravest soldier who spearheaded a army. He carried out a herculean task of carrying a team on his own shoulder. <br>  <br>  He is having the world record for having most world records.

Against Lara too, if i start discussing Tendulkar's stats then i will make a strong statement but i don't have much time right now to do that.<br>  <br>  I think all these comparisons are waste of time, Tendulkar during his 20 year long career has archived things which Lara & Ponting could only dream off.|`|Qr9UFnIuaa	Sachin Tendulkar has scored 43 ODI centuries.

Dave Batista is rehabbing better than WWE originally anticipated and may return to television soon. Vince, Shane and Stephaie were all injured as part of the Randy Orton Storyline, so they are selling their injuries, which means they are off television until they decided that they have sold their injuries enough.

AA11416243	I think its a very smart move for the bills. First they will get some prime time games now with T.O. and it much needed for that city. Second T.O. will be the man there it will be his team, his city and he will be the center of attion just what he wants. Marshawn is the only other big time guy on the team and with T.O. there watch Marshawn rushing yards sky rocket. T.O. on the Bills looks weird but you know what its a perfect fit and if I was a Bills fan I would be excited to get the season started.<br>  <br>  <br>  (GO GIANTS)|`|9wblT5sYaa	as a Bills fan I am shocked. I never thought we would make a bug splash like this in free agency. I just hope Trent can get back throwing the ball well with confidence, and if he does TO will produce which in tern will help out Lee and the other WRs. this WILL make us a huge contender. plus even if it doesn't work out, its just a one year deal. good roll of the dice if you ask me cant wait for Bills season to start. maybe next year the Bills resign him because they ARE contenders.|`|XaFYUMRSaa	Only getting him to sign a 1 year deal was great for the Bills.|`|WaaFCtuOaa	Really doesn't matter cause TO ain't getting a ring in Buffalo & he will do what he does bvest, run his mouth & be distaction to the team|`|SJFAXcHjaa	Overall, its a good move for both sides I think. Being from the buffalo area I was surprised that they made a move to get such a big name player like TO. But here is why I think it will work..<br>  <br>  The bills dont have the media circus surrounding them like a lot of other NFL teams do and hopefully this will keep TO out of the lime light.<br>  <br>  TO has never caused a problem for a team the first year he has been with them. The problems come later on but the bills only got him for 1 year so hopefully they can avoid the problems associated with him.<br>  <br>  Buffalo picked up TO at a good price. They need a big name player to get fans interested in them. TO will help sell tickets and get people to watch the games (This is good seeing Buffalo is the 2nd poorest city with an NFL team...)<br>  <br>  This is a good move for TO because he can have the spotlight in buffalo because the team doesn't really have any other big name receivers so he will be the star and will most likely get a lot of passes thrown his way. Plus, If he has a good season with buffalo and doesn't cause any problems, his stock will go up and more teams will want him next season.|`|94cYJd5qaa	there is a reason the the Bills only signed him to a 1 year contract.<br>  only being on a 1 year plan, T.O. has some thing to prove. Remember the first year T.O. was in Dallas, he was a great player, and he didn't waist his time making problems. Now he has to do it again, with out the security of a multi year deal. Owens doesn't plan on retiring after this year, and im sure he doesn't want to move after this upcoming season, so he will play at a high level with out any problems for at least this year. After that, depending on his contract situation, who know what he is going to do.|`|2d7f6636775227e6f83d1df754993208aa	Good move for the Bills.  Here's why: T.O. has always done well to prove himself in the first year or two for a new team.  So they will get great productivity.  At the same time, the Bills gave him a 1-year contract.  They get the best out of him while minimizing the eventual seepage of his toxic personality.  I think they played it perfectly.|`|qFiuIIEsaa	GOOD MOVE FOR T.O. BAD FOR BILLS IT MIGHT WORK FOR ONE YEAR AND THAT'S IT|`|45UxRjQtaa	I never thought id see the bills make a good move in free agenecy, i love it, it takes so much pressure off of lee evans,|`|sAHTMuAeaa	Good move to make Lee Evans non-existent.|`|k1E2ug9gaa	bad move for bills they bout themselves destruction <br>  <br>  oh well im a phins fan|`|HMv6jvUCaa	I was very surprised<br>  <br>  I think the Bill just put a lot of pressure on themselves.  Now the offense has to do good, like top 5 good. They're receiving core is stacked now, they have a good running back (depending on his legal situation) and a franchise QB. <br>  <br>  If the offense struggles this year T.O. will be the least of their troubles.|`|f7qVtYfaaa	i think acquiring owens is a reasonable risk for the bills , he is a very good receiver still and can help a team . but it is a risk due to his locker room"charm".

uWYlumvsaa	I'm not sure playing Doubles was the smartest idea, but it gives her a chance to sharpen her skills at the net, which would do wonders for her game. Nice to see her back. The women's game could really use her again, as she's probably the only one that could put a stranglehold on Venus and Serena having total dominance of the tour right now. It'll take her awhile to find her game, but once Summer gets going, so will Maria, and women's tennis will really take off again. I expect Maria will play Singles again in Miami, or if not, in Charleston (green clay) for sure.|`|6S8KjBLQaa	All I can say is DAMN she isn't playing singles..and as for this I doubt she'll be good, 1st round exit..she probably isn't good at doubles, eh another boring tourney..and isn't Vesina russian? :P LOL|`|gP7IB2XCaa	I'm not a huge Maria fan, but i hope she plays well and makes womens tennis more exciting.

This is  good option because the people see your adversite.<br>  <br>  Second:  You can include more things to the website. And the people are more attracted to the website.|`|BrSDvWacaa	Best way might be to advertise heavily in trailer parks, skid-row bars and prisons.

jTFdG8xqaa	if his board is longer than yours he is probably a little faster, the larger area actually cuts down on friction so he can go faster. It's also possible that your wax is not the correct temperature (ie does not melt fast enough or melts to fast). Go to your pro shop and see if they have a hot box to get the wax in deep (a hot bag is also a correct treatment) this heats the ski's for a while and allows the wax to penetrate deep otherwise you aren't doing much. Good luck.|`|p3qMXuPGaa	Go take the board to your local shop and have them give it a stone grind with some structure.  This will help reduce the friction in the base thats happening.
f7qVtYfaaa	aaron curry is the must pick there , he might even go before they can take him!|`|oYsSL991aa	Curry the chiefs need a good LB (unless the Rams take him in which case I would say Crabtree to give Cassel a go-to WR)|`|iMGSaC0qaa	Well coming into the offseason Kansas City was in need of a Quarterback. That isn't the case anymore. So you can throw a QB Selection out the window on day one. Their Biggest needs are Linebacker, Offensive Tackle, and Defensive End. With the Lions being the usual Dumb Lions, they are looking in depth to Aaron Curry instead of Matt Stafford. <br>  <br>  If Curry is avaliable at number 3, Chiefs will snag him. If not I see them taking an offensive tackle to help Protect Cassel. Crabtree would be a solid pick up, but I doubt they go in that direction.|`|i0QzvbSnaa	I see them taking Aaron Curry as they really need a solid linebacker. If not, I am kind of pulling for them to take Crabtree. He is the perfect compliment for Matt Cassell out of all the wide receivers in the draft and most in the NFL. He runs the type of routes that Wes Welker does and might be better at getting open. The problem is that their defense is in need of upgrade everywhere.|`|c03a1e29209b69a15065f8edab5c54daaa	If Curry is available, he'll probably be the pick.  If not, Eugene Monroe or Jason Smith.  However, with Pioli there is always a chance that he'll trade down toward the middle the first round in order to get an extra pick and then select either Orakpo, Maybin or Raji to play DE in the 3-4 scheme they'll be implementing.<br>  <br>  Really, the Chiefs have so many needs that its hard to really know what they'll do.|`|KdcansIyaa	I do not think curry as much as Crabtree or Brian O from texas.|`|gF6pgy8raa	They need to draft defense. They were last in sacks last season so a guy like Brian Orakpo would make a lot of sense. I also wouldn't be surprised if they took the safest and best player in the draft in Aaron Curry.|`|k1E2ug9gaa	u watch curry is going to be one of the best to play the game he is a tackling machine and has progressed very much with his pass rush  <br>  <br>  thats who the cheifs need and want|`|qFiuIIEsaa	IM THINKING CURRY TOO CUZ THEY HAVE TO ADDRESS THERE D
BB6HGbnPaa	Ask yourself these questions. Do you have the endurance to do long distance? Do you have to speed to do short distance? Are you able to run 4 times (a mile), 8 times (2 mile) without slowing down? Are you able to fight thru the pain in short distance? Try to make pros and cons for both long and short distance and compare to see which one you like to do.|`|WrDGhduxaa	You should try different races since you have not run track before.<br>  If you are fast and can also run long distance, then running middle distance may be your best race. Try the 800 and see, you can move up or down from there.|`|ckNjHiZzaa	You may very well be decent at both, but you can't be good at both.  The question is what do you want to run.  There will be times when your motivation is sagging, and that's when running what you want to run will get you out the door for a workout.<br>  <br>  If you're still undecided, ask your coach what he thinks you have a talent for.  He's trained to spot certain characteristics in certain types of runners.
ZAQCvcIyaa	If a girl wants to play football then they should be allowed. You dont even have to wear a cup.|`|616b18f35255971ece90dca0da3b2da8aa	There are girls that play at the High School level for some small high schools. A girl got killed in Illinois in 02' while attempting to play with boys. They had tried a few girls as place kickers at the college level without success.<br>  <br>  There are no rules prohibiting girls from playing football.|`|kZeu2Dyzaa	If you are good enough there probably isn't anything stopping you.|`|MhcAJNetaa	of course it's not wrong, in fact I know of several women that have played at the H.S. level and some have even made it to the college level.<br>  <br>  <br>  Jack.. You have no idea what your talking about. Guess you forgot about Katie Hnida, a  kicker at the University of Colorado in 1999 ,then later at the University of New Mexico. Not to mention I PERSONALLY know a girl who is playing on a college football team. There are no current D1 female players that I know of, but there are some at lower levels. The person I know plays at small DIII school.<br>  <br>  Stop being an idiot.|`|bIbyAkHPaa	There were 24 words in that question. Not small at all.|`|kXPmr9oDaa	no|`|Lh2hVEPraa	Yes, it is.  I'm not a sexist, but football is a man's sport.  When girls play, even in middle school, there are a whole bunch of problems that arise.  The main one being sexual harassment.  A boy goes in for a tackle and then the girl says that he intentionally grabbed her sexually.  If girls wanted to start their own league and have it be only girls, that would be a good solution.  The problem there is that there are not a lot of girls that want to play, so there aren't enough to start a new league.  In short, yes, it is wrong.|`|k1E2ug9gaa	tocman they have not it is impossible its a rule they can not play college ball|`|kG2c19r3aa	It's not wrong until you play D.

AA11416243	No, Why not well that I dont know. I think maybe its because its games are on Lifetime and not really shown on espn, tnt or other channels like that. I love watchin Women's college basketball it really competitive and has alot of heart. So im not to sure why I dont watch the WNBA but if they put it on regular TV once in awhile I bet there would be some ratings improvements|`|YhfMrppSaa	Yes, when there is no NBA, and SA playing on playoffs vs LA|`|HtYGxZcCaa	Nope, I dont watch it because its so slow and boring.

When the US ladies was playing from 1996-2000 i really was watch it becuae i love Sheryl Swoopes, Cynthia Cooper and Tina Thompson, Lisa Leslie but after Cooper and Sheryl retired i really stop watching and the only reason i watch the past season was because of Candice Parker.

HMv6jvUCaa	3 time outs per half<br>  <br>  6 total|`|AA12103453	I'd think they play by the same standard of every other level, 3 PER HALF(up to 6 a game but they don't carry over from the first half)|`|Lh2hVEPraa	The can use three time-out a half.  If they don't use any the first half, they still only get three the second half.  There is no challenging in high school though.|`|Gva0qq3Yaa	3 in each half and 1 without carryover for each overtime should any overtimes be needed.|`|k1E2ug9gaa	yah 3 per 1/2
HMv6jvUCaa	5 yards or 15 feet whichever is longer|`|xcZE68JFaa	yep 5 yards|`|Lh2hVEPraa	Off-side is a penalty for a defensive player being over the line of scrimmage at the snap.  It is a five (5) yard penalty.  If a defensive player is over the line before the snap, but gets back before, then there is no penalty.  There is a penalty if the defensive player crosses the line before the snap and touches and offensive player.  This is called encroachment.  It is also a five (5) yard penalty.  If and offensive player is set and  moves before the snap, this is a false start.  It is a five (5) yard penalty on the offense.|`|65UWmm57aa	5 yards

JGjwHrqAaa	I live in mississippi and there's a local furniture maker who puts new cloth on for ya for 50 dollars. Not sure if that's the average price since he doesn't do it for a living. Also if ur gonna reassemble it yourself why not put the new cloth on too. Not as hard as u think. Me and my bro put my table togther and the cloth. They sent a assembly video with the table and its a 8ft table with 3 piece inch thick slate. Solid oak. A real table and it wasn't too bad. You should go to youtube and type in refelting pool table and see what comes up. Sure u can find a video on it. Or google how to refet a pool table. Toy around with differnt words to type.u probally don't even have to take the whole table apart to refelt it. Just the side rails and head rails. Some 3m spray glue and a staple gun. The hardest part is the ends on each rail. U need to pull them tight and away from your work when stapling. Well type it in and see if u can get the info on how to do it and u mat want to do it yourself. Good Luck|`|esLsR6keaa	I suggest doing it yourself because it isn't very difficult.  New cloth could cost anywhere from $50-$500 depending on what kind you buy.

U have to actually show SOME decent level of skill and talent, not just got hits on youtube from mindless ignorant teenagers (trust me- I have a teenage daughter that sits and watches "Fred" videos on youtube for hours at a time. Seriously... Fred?!? A kid with an editing machine who speeds up the tape to make his voice sound like Alvin and the Chipmunks, or some untrained homeless guy beating up on other untrained homeless guys and calling it mma, is what teenagers think is cool now? Man- I'm glad I'm not a kid anymore. Our society is truly getting dumber every day.) Kimbo belonged to EliteXC- a terrible mma organization run into the ground by cbs exec. Jared Shaw, cuz he pimped Slice as the "new face of mma", when in actuality- the guy didn't even belong in the ring with a guy (Petruzelli) who was eliminated from The Ultimate Fighter in week 1! The result (14 secs., btw) would've been no diff. if the opponent had been Shamrock, or even Lesnar. The only reason Kimbo beat Thompson previously was cuz they put him against a guy with an already existing injury, terrible striking defense, and (to Slice's credit) he has KO power... So one shot was all it took to bust that guy's ear open... it wasn't that impressive. Same thing in the Brock situation- u put a bar/street/youtube brawler against a trained martial artist (even a beginner like Brock or a less than impressive Petruzelli)... 9 outta 10 times, the martial artist wins. It's like bringing a knife to a gun fight... stupid to bet on the guy with the knife. Brock is still a beginner in mma, and has already notched impressive victories over mma veterans (1 a dominating KO of a hall-of-fame champ!), and was even impressive in his fluke loss to Mir. Nothing against Kimbo- I don't blame him for taking EXC and CBS's $$$... I would too; and he's a great rags to riches story. But his 15 mins. of fame are done; I can't believe someone would actually even entertain the idea that Kimbo would stand a chance...|`|wKMCI1azaa	Brock vs Kimbo  Nanaaaaaa now Brock vs Fedor WWAAAOOO  that is the fight to watch''  a great match for Kimbo will be Rampage Jackson a great stand up fight.|`|KbxPl1oYaa	Kimbo who?

nRBC4E5saa	CHUCO, back from being banned?|`|Ur5KrGgjaa	thanks that was funny and kimbo was never in the UFC the street brawls agiasnt hand picked oppents dont count he fought a preety good fighter and got KO'd in like 14 seconds he is a joke and to put him in the same sentence with ali lee and norris are you high?|`|IRNvfdB9aa	Parody.<br>  <br>  E|`|Qpx6gCwFaa	Very funny.|`|S0N3BRecaa	I'm no stranger to sarcasm.|`|1oNi2v38aa	I agree, Kimbo is a legend. His influence in martial arts can not be described with words. Kimbo showed the world what true martial arts really is, and he should be worshiped.|`|ETurhACOaa	Kimbo slice is entertaining, but his skill level is limited, beating up bums and steroid using bouncers is not that impressive. I think he should fight forrest griffin it would probally be a pretty close match|`|AA10820062	...Uhh...I.... *Vomits on himself*|`|KbxPl1oYaa	Who let the troll in here?  Shouldn't you go back under your bridge??|`|FPuFDrZDaa	clearly, u go by vudusup on the mma blog...<br>  : p|`|ydoIYwGTaa	Do you get a tax break for being this stupid?|`|z8cQwTx1aa	i hope this is a joke if not then you know nothing about martial arts. second all i have to say is WOW i didnt know so many wwe fans watched MMA and im sure one of them|`|dDas43FZaa	This has to be a joke.<br>  <br>  Look for Kimbo vs Bear on YouTube and then tell me he has never lost.
naZQqrNeaa	I was really hoping for Youppi to get the job, lol.  I think they needed some change.  Guy has had his time......I hate to see him go....but then again, I would like to see some more wins. I hope to see a replacement soon, or Gainey may soon be out of a job himself.  Usually when you see the quick shuffle, you know it was a "fire him or you are fired" type of situation.  <br>  <br>  It will be fun to see him behind the bench, if nothing else.|`|AA11674745	I think you are correct. But, I think the Habs have torn a page out of the New Jersey Devils policy of firing a coach this late in the season. I'm not sold on the idea that this was a good move. The timing might be too early as I felt the Habs were doing somewhat better. Besides, why fire a coach because of the previous months of a season? The Stanley Cup is won in June - not March.<br>  <br>  This had better work out for the Canadiens. If not, they could end up turning over the roster and suffer some real disappointment in the coming seasons.|`|Jb5itwHtaa	I think its is too little, too late. Something should have been done about 6 weeks ago. Seems like the Habs and their fans are a perfect match. Always thinking they are better than they really are. <br>  <br>  PS... LITY, I didn't know Therian had a philosophy?? What was it, to show up at the rink?|`|GyGhHpRraa	Rumor has it they are heavily interested in Michael Therrien, and have been since his termination as head coach of the Pittsburgh Penguins.|`|iBHvffXUaa	IT GOOD I HAPPY HE BAD COACH AND HE MAKE THE TEAM LOSE|`|XQoH9ZI5aa	The city is safe from the looters and rioters.........for now. Montreal has ZERO chance of going anywhere this year.<br>  <br>   I am suprised!......somewhat.|`|d0d7b35a707f98e4d94fb32cc3b60b5baa	Terrific player. Lousy coach.|`|a9f693c71e4b465afcc9a6b377b02694aa	Rumours abound that in the last few days that Gainey has talked to Tom Renney, Peter Laviolette and Denis Savard about the job. <br>  <br>  I find it hard to believe that Therrien would be considered as the Montreal franchise has always had a stance against re-hiring people they've fired. One of the reasons behind Therrien's firing in the first place was that he and Gainey (who became GM while Therrien was coach) did not have the same same philosophy.....and it was that exact same philosphy that got Therrien fired in Pittsburgh|`|G33E41IBaa	Who do they think they are?!  The Devils??  We're infamous for firing our coaches late in the season and replacing them with our GM!  Haha jk :)<br>  <br>  I think it was the right thing to do.  They went from being first in the East to being 2 points away from not making the playoffs.  Something needed to be done, and the coach is always the first to go when a team isn't doing well/meeting expectations.|`|1cde960f92f3cf52ea9b7b2bff72b659aa	The fact that we sucked for a while had absolutely nothing to do with a lousy goaltender who's hopefully finally waking up... How about my favorite player Komi..what the heck is up with him? He forgot how to do his job since he made it to the all stars?!<br>  <br>  I hate how they get rid of coaches that easily and yet the players that need a good swift kick get to stick around...<br>  <br>  yeah..I'm mad|`|2iuZdBXraa	Do you really want opinions from people who are less "passionate" than Habs fans?  Sheesh, we're not worthy.<br>  Edit - I thought I was calm, I didn't throw in one 4 letter word. lol.

uS8hK7Zhaa	Big Show spoiled it on VH1, but the person who edited the Wikipedia page was a little too quick on the draw to just throw that in there. Even if the match is set to be a triple threat,<br>  <br>  A. It hasn't been officially announced yet<br>  B. Plans could change at any minute.<br>  <br>  There have been stories of Mr. McMahon throwing out fake spoilers to confuse people, this just may be one of them|`|lefZ8I7jaa	even though its obcious that its gonna be a triple threat and maybe on some level its already been said and i know big show said it as well but you must remember that anyone can upload info on wikipedia and im pretty sure that a fan has written it even though its true|`|lGIL36faaa	well the reason 4 that is the big show spilled the beans on vh1 a day or 2 ago....so its actually announced and mostly every1 knows about it...they will probably announce it on raw 2nite|`|ULSUqmeZaa	The Big Show spoiled it on Vh1 over the weekend in an interview. So technically its already been confirmed.|`|ZpH2PFF9aa	Big Show vs Edge vs John Cena=Big Show|`|mQJnWBv2aa	Big show spoiled it on Vh1, plus think about it even if he hadn't (its wikipedia)|`|NG5mOGsUaa	I guess so, it'll probably be announced tonight
1ccf4408a6862b6272c7872e63b19c51aa	Yes their was Between the time where the Jordan Legacy Began and the Magic Era ended in 1991 The Finals was that year between the two so It Happened but It didn't last long.|`|AA10248312	The met in the finals one time, in 1991.  They haven't been rivals since, because they've never been good at the same time.<br>  <br>  Both teams were great in the early-mid 70s...there was more of a rivalry then than there's ever been since.|`|qtwYHyH5aa	Not really because when was of team is good, the other one isnt..I think in the 1989-1990 and in the 1991-1992 seasons, they were rivalries/.|`|6yoQhXsOaa	The Bulls owns the lakers!|`|BTZ4vFKJaa	no
wKnjGSU1aa	Puerto Rico Islanders VS. Cruz Azul will be held in Puerto Rico in the First Leg, then the 2nd leg will be held in the Estadio Azul. <br>  <br>  Santos VS. Atlante will be held in the Estadio Corona in the 1st leg, then the 2nd leg will be in Atlante's stadium.<br>  <br>  If Cruz Azul or Puerto Rico go through, no matter what, they will hold the 1st leg because in the Group Stage, Cruz Azul and Puerto Rico ended in 2nd Place, while both Santos and Atlante finished in 1st Place. So therefore, either Santos or Atlante will hold the 2nd Final in their home stadium.<br>  <br>  Just look on that same page.<br>  <a href="http://www.concacaf.com/competitions/champsleague/index.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.concacaf.com/competitions/cha...</a>|`|SvNcWfdJaa	what eazy said|`|I5FsYmjIaa	Nope but thanx for the duece points|`|6uc8ROfWaa	Atlante game vs santos is first in el corona and the in cancun <br>  and puerto rico 1st in pr the df
S0u3HKzhaa	Doubt it because really the reason for the screwjob was money.And at that time Vince could not pay Bret the amount of money he promised to pay him.And Bret also refused to drop the title in Montreal because after all he is Canadian and McMahon did really turn the american audience against Bret Hart.So the screwjob really occurred because of all that.<br>  <br>  But The Undertaker is currently one of the biggest names on the roster as Bret was in 1997.But Taker is not treating to go anywhere and Vince can well pay Taker.And I would honestly like to believe Vince would not go through with another screwjob especially with The Undertaker because he is such a loyal employee.But to put Shawn Micheals through the screwjob where obviously he could come off as nothing but the bad guy once again is just plain cruel.And honestly Montreal nearly rioted the arena they did go crazy outside the arena however but the worse they did inside was throw things at Shawn,Vince,Brisco and Trips.<br>  <br>  Honestly the odds of that happening are just about none.Vince would not be able to live it down.And that being the second time the media would tear him apart and give him very bad publuicity which McMahon does not need.And I don't think Shawn would go through with another screwjob personally.And The Undertaker is not close to threating to leave for TNA anyways and Vince can pay him.<br>  <br>  BQ: I would be quite surprised and very pissed off.The Montreal Screwjob was such a big topic in professional wrestling.Another one would be very shocking.Especailly Shawn Micheals doing it again.And with someone he has worked with for almost two decades.I don't think it will ever happen but the wwe would be ripped apart by the media.|`|oAjbBLDpaa	No, Vince would never screw Undertaker. Undertaker is one of the main reasons that Vince's company can do as good as it is doing. Not only is he a great in ring talent, a great crowd drawer, but he also helps behind the scenes. He is a locker room leader, a guide to younger talent, and just a loyal man. He should and will not be cheated.<br>  <br>  BQ: I would hate Vince for it. Vince and everyone who influenced him to have the idea to do it. They should never do that to their most loyal worker.|`|mJvZhdAuaa	Anything is possible, especially if he were to piss of Vince McMahon, however it is unlikely, because the Undertaker isn't going to another company.  There is no reason to screw over 'Taker, unless, as I said, he pissed someone off.|`|KIOR56r6aa	No, cause he's not an egoistical maniac like Bret.<br>  <br>  BQ : There will be a riot.|`|xKXu0Qb2aa	Not Unless They Want a Lawsuit on Their Hands & Millions of Fans to Stop Watching Forever.<br>  Mark Calaway has a "No WM Loss" Clause in His Contact  , & if He gets "Screwed" ala Bret Hart - Vince & WWE is Getting Sued for Literally Hundreds of Millions of Dollars.<br>  Plus , Vince Might be a Dirty Prick , but Even HE isn't THAT Much of a Douchebag. And He's Also on The Good Side with Mark. He has No Reason to Screw Him.<br>  <br>  <br>  BQ - Seriously? , Really? , WTF!?<br>  That's It , I'm Done.<br>  Hey , looky There , TNA...|`|uS8hK7Zhaa	Why would a screwjob be involved with Undertaker's WrestleMania win streak ending? If he was so adamant that he didn't want it to end I'm sure something would be worked out between he and the WWE. And what incentive would WWE have to screw him anyway? It wouldn't make sense<br>  <br>  BQ: "If they did, which they won't"- why ask the question then? Seems like you are trying to stir up something that isn't there.|`|8TW00N9Daa	There are a lot of factors for the Montreal Screw job that aren't in play today.<br>  <br>  For one there is no competition for WWE.  TNA and ROH are so far away from where WCW was at that time.<br>  <br>  There would have to be some bad blood between him and Vince.<br>  <br>  I would go on, but there is 0% chance of it happening for real, now for an angle anything can happen.|`|L3MkAG6Qaa	No, they wouldn't. The only reason they ever screwed Bret was because he was an arrogant guy who just wanted to make things more complicated by retaining his title in his last match in the company.<br>  <br>  BQ: I wouldn't be too upset, because I know that Mark is such a great guy that he wouldn't have a fit about it. In my mind, he would just laugh and move on.|`|a45ffb40e1ff08eda37fb35f65c6eecaaa	i doubt it. the reason (i believe) that bret got screwed is because is was going to jump ship to WCW, WWE's biggest compition. Bret had gotten great oppertunities in WWE and vince thought he was ungrateful. thats my theory.|`|qUQnsqnsaa	The WWE might screw The Undertaker at Wrestlemania, thanks to HBK. But, that's not gonna happen because the WWE has plans to have Undertaker retire after Wrestlemania *26* and hopefully he goes 18-0!|`|qWNcOhJJaa	Of course not.  For one, Taker doesn't need to put over HBK.  Second, Taker isn't leaving the WWE so why piss off someone who will still be an employee?  Hart was on his way out the door so they didn't give a crap anyway.|`|NG5mOGsUaa	They never would screw Undertaker, it just wont happen but if they did I would stop watching|`|yEsw7UkWaa	Boy, Maddie, you sure know how to put a cat amongst the pigeons huh? LOL...Good Question though!<br>  It wouldn't happen, like everyone else has said. Mainly because WWE is a solo star these days, and Taker isn't looking to jump ship. <br>  Bret was advised by Vince that going to WWE would be a good thing, as Vince couldn't stick to the financial agreement of Bret's contract. (Dumb move, signing a guy to a 20 year multi million $ contract when your in a slump!)<br>  The other reason it won't happen is because the paying fans are much more aware of what happens behind the scenes these days. We wouldn't let Vinnie get away with it.<br>  Imagine the loss of money WWE would suffer in doing such a dumb move?<br>  <br>  Having said all that though, I'm reminded of the time the Rock came back to WWE and had to decide between joining the Alliance or the WWE. Even then Vince admitted that if it was good for business, he would screw Rock again....<br>  It doesn't matter if Taker has a good relationship with Vince - Bret did too - Vince just can't be trusted...|`|6ueL0gkAaa	Would never happen. Taker has been a loyal employee of WWE for almost 20 years now. In fact, its been reported numerous times Taker has went to Vince wanting to end the streak to put a new talent over, but Vince is a big fan of it and wants to let it ride. They would never screw over Taker legitly.<br>  <br>  BQ: I wouldnt stop watching like other users have said, but Id be pretty disappointed in the WWE for doing such a thing to a loyal employee|`|lefZ8I7jaa	no chance in hell because i know they did it to bret but that was different because the wwe was the bigger of the two and im not saying that the undertaker is bigger then the wwe but if they ever did they would lose a heck lot of fans. one reason they would never do it because bret would pass the torch to shawn but undertaker always sets a good example and is willing to push young stars and stay out of th elimelight for the most and only keeps glory for wrestlemania|`|raSr9PYhaa	I would go to vinces house and kill him and kill his wife. I would sacrifice my life to protect Undertaker. He is the best and he had made me proud. He is the best DEADMAN FOR EVA!!!|`|z6enccBKaa	No undertaker is well respected in the wwe<br>  <br>  I would have to look at that crappy total nonstop @$$holes|`|1JywgkyMaa	undertaker is one of very few superstars that wwe actually cares about,but if they did do it,if i were vince i would look over my shoulder everyday|`|Q1MI6L96aa	He is a company lifer...Richter and Hart's was due to an unresolved contract dispute and a dispute to drop the strap due to leaving the company, respectively. I could see a story live develop around him being screwed by company executives, but nothing "real."|`|Xkm4PstOaa	If, and this is a big IF, Undertaker loses at Wrestlemania...then it is something that would be planned.  Vince has learned his lesson from his past...and so has HBK.  There will not be another "screw job"!<br>  <br>  BQ:  If he loses it would be a shame.  But I wouldn't be angry or anything to that extent.  HBK is the showstopper.... I wouldn't be mad at all!  Now if it were anyone else... i would be a little PO'd!

Both clubs 'let him go' but Bruce has managed to get him back on track so it's worked out well in the end. <br>  Gnashing teeth - Ferdinand and Vidic.|`|Hiasgb75aa	Not everyone. he's been one of the best defenders this Season.

mOaxBZ2Raa	I'm still trying to figure out wtf they're trying to do.....they let go B Dawk, Lito Sheppard(he was my favorite CB), Correll Buckhalter, Tra Thomas, Jon Runyan, and the only players they got in FA is Sean Jones and Stacy Andrews....I think Andy Reid and the rest of the organization are losing it|`|G15dXNlKaa	The Eagles have a lot of depth at o-line so I think they have a plan for that. They also picked up a tackle Stacy Andrews in free agency. As for receiver, Jackson had a good rookie year so things are looking up.|`|FZ1dy9uCaa	We'll be alright. We can still pick some WR's up in the draft, as we have a ton of picks, not to mention 2 in the first round. I think It'll still be a half decent year for us.|`|exOOXAkBaa	Pretty big. Deep inside he wishes T.O was still with the Eagles.|`|acaAycEXaa	They need to head him off at the pass by handing him a 3rd grade math test the moment he shows up.<br>  <br>  Of course there is a U.S. Mint in Philly. They could appease him by putting his likeness on the next version of the Buffalo-Head Nickel.|`|doFdrgfKaa	Don't you just love it when the Eagles make fools of themselves?  That must be some pretty good stuff Andy Reid has been smoking.<br>  <br>  The moves they have made this off season make Jerry Jones look good.  That's pretty bad!|`|eDXKsRToaa	I think he'll do all right. We should get some good WR and we have 2 first picks in the draft, so we can get alot of good recievers. As long as Donovan Mcnabb works with them, he wont throw a big fit|`|mkueXAKoaa	Marvin Harrison is out there, and McNabb likes him so i wouldn't be surprised if they picked him up. And they could draft a WR, they have two first round picks.|`|bIbyAkHPaa	No doubt he will find something to complain about.|`|ga4ZWsuZaa	They will still be good, just not as good, if they have a great draft and get a safety to replace dawkins. Westbrook still has some gas left in the tank, mcnabb can still make all of the throws, and they have samules. The thing is they dont have enough cap room, samuls is eating it up.|`|rNUyV1EYaa	I'm thinking this, Bevo:<br>  <br>  Demarcus Ware lined up across from new Eagles left tackle Winston Justice; who gave up six sacks to Osi Umenyiara last time he played.<br>  <br>  I don't know about McNabb; but this sure looks good for Cowboys fans.
7BIiofbaaa	Well, here are the only indoor shoes made for women that I could find:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.soccer.com/IWCatProductPage.process?Merchant_Id=1&Ne=284&N=4294960675+594+286&Product_Id=297767" rel="nofollow">http://www.soccer.com/IWCatProductPage.p...</a><br>  <br>  They're not very good though. I'd suggest getting some Samba Milleniums or Nike First Touch shoes because those are the two best kinds. I'm pretty sure you can get both of them at D*ck's, and they should be within the average price range. And yes, guys shoes are bigger than women's. I don't typically wear mine other than to the games, though you can if you want.<br>  <br>  Samba Milleniums:<br>  <a href="http://www.soccer.com/IWCatProductPage.process?Merchant_Id=1&query=Adidas+Samba&N=0&Product_Id=2462" rel="nofollow">http://www.soccer.com/IWCatProductPage.p...</a><br>  <br>  First Touches:<br>  <a href="http://www.soccer.com/Navigation.process?Ntt=Nike+First+Touch&N=0&Ntk=Search&Nty=1&Ntx=mode%2Bmatchallany&Dx=mode%2Bmatchallany&x=0&y=0" rel="nofollow">http://www.soccer.com/Navigation.process...</a>|`|cxE91Nrnaa	Nike and adidas are good shoes mine have lasted 2 years|`|ZOYyfBFYaa	****?<br>  I'm a girl and I got my adidas size 8 from sportcheck. They also have nike and adidas and umbro at sportcheck and foot locker. I got mine this year, and so far they've lasted. My outdoor nike ones have lasted for 2 years now. I wear my indoor ones to other places as well like dance and the mall.<br>  <br>  But indoor season is almost over now, isn't it? Outdoor should be starting soon.
VU6ODC5Baa	I don't think she should leave,she is a good Wrestler unlike most of the other Divas.|`|T13xM9iJaa	Well if she wants to something else I say more power to her|`|SsodRf4kaa	She will probably win the title at WM25 in a 25 diva battle royal featuring old divas from Debra Marshall all the way to new divas like Maryse.|`|h5lOMoqBaa	She was never a good wrestler, she only looks good in the ring when she's wrestling women who can wrestle, and that's because the women who can wrestle make her look good by CARRYING HER THROUGH THE MATCHES.<br>  <br>  <br>  A GOOD WRESTLER WOULD LOOK GOOD IN THE RING AGAINST ANYONE, AND COULD MAKE ANYONE LOOK GOOD AGAINST THEM, EVEN UNTALENTED HOS LIKE MARIA, CANDICE CAN'T DO THAT.|`|hL3eS2zKaa	I think that they should keep her around for a little while more, who knows, maybe she'll get a push. I dont want her to leave that badly, I finally have some respect for her.|`|OuFhcdX9aa	i would be happy if she started doing porn again b/c she's not a good wrestler.|`|IzgJpVgBaa	well shes reinjured but i hope not|`|XukKFRD9aa	Well melina and james pretty much took over the face part of the raw divas and since wwe usually has a hard time pushing more than one diva it's not hard to see why but now that I heard this their probably going to push candice soon to keep her under contract.|`|yEsw7UkWaa	She hasn't really done a lot to advance her career in the ring.<br>  Getting the collarbone injury probably shook her confidence, and now she had injured her ankle.<br>  I think she may be better suited to doing something behind the scenes.|`|IVEdWA2uaa	She wasnt a very good wrestler..improved..but she isnt that good.  Then she keeps getting injured..so she might leave and go do softcore pornos again.|`|EJMtFvq4aa	She should stay longer<br>  I'm finally respecting her as a wrestler<br>  shes pretty good.|`|mKtGiuyZaa	I hope so, she's nice but all she has caused is WWE to spend money
mzTJarucaa	Try it first. If you're comfortable with it, go ahead! If not, well, talk to your in-charge and ask fora different time slot. But look on the bright side: you get to watch and observe senior levels! You'll be able to get a lot of techniques from them. And besides, you said you had 2 friends, and they're your age. Look, I was placed in time with seniors one time, and they are like 3-5 years younger than me. At you'll be with the same-aged people as you.<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|AA10295791	Don't worry about making yourself look like an idiot! It's not your fault, you weren't incharge of placing yourself in a group. They obviously put you in there for a reason, so skate your best, and let the more advanced skaters push you to do better! It's great that you already have friends there, so they can help you out. Worse comes to worse, if you can't handle it, you can always move out. Just keep a smile on your face and try your hardest!! Good Luck!<br>  <br>  P.S. You may want to talk to your coach or skating director. :D|`|vA3sEcQIaa	Don't worry at all! I am an senior skater who has just been moved up to advanced so i know how you feel. At first i thought it was horrible, but know i realize it is good because they help me with stuff i am no good at. Try asking one of them for help on something difficult and you might end up doing it well and making new friends!
FY17j1Ajaa	East Coast bias. NBC wants advertising dollars. Also, time zone factors. Most of the other divisions would have the games start before noon, local time. NBC likes the current time slot.|`|axxQzOCHaa	besides that didn't you know Nbc unofficially means the Nothing but Crosby network ?|`|Pc0QjrQ4aa	Let's get out a map of the United States.  <br>  <br>  Look at these huge population centres.  We'll call them cities.  Okay, there's a bunch of huge ones near this giant body of water (commonly known as the Atlantic ocean).  Philadelphia, New York, Boston.  They have hockey teams that have huge followings.  <br>  <br>  Now, let's take a gander at where people in the US play a lot of hockey.  Michigan...is there a big city in Michigan...why yes there is!  And sweet jeezus, they have an NHL team!<br>  <br>  Where else...hmm...Buffalo.  <br>  <br>  Now, who are these two young guys that started playing in 2005-06.  Where do they play?  Pittsburgh and Washington.  Got it.<br>  <br>  Okay, that covers geography.  Now let's talk time.  NBC's window is a 12:30 pm (eastern time) start (they have other commitments at later times).  Kind of rules out any teams in the Pacific and Mountain time zones (usually not awake at 9:30am/10:30am to watch hockey).<br>  <br>  In short, geography, time zones, and ratings.|`|1ccf4408a6862b6272c7872e63b19c51aa	Location Location Location, Most NHL Teams are on the East Coast and NBC is based in New York City where Most of the Hockey World is, even Detroit is a short Drive from NYC.<br>  <br>  So If you are a Fan in Chicago, Dallas or San Jose, you are SOL because you are too far for New York and NBC has Local O&O Stations there too.<br>  <br>  Its not how to please the Network Its how you please the Fanbase and the Northeast has a Strong Fanbase when its Come to Hockey.|`|EkgZeAbqaa	they always want to have the gave at 12:30, so no team in the west would want to play at 9:30 am. Also they cant resist showing the Penguins because that is the team most not real fans will watch because (sadly) the only player they know is Crosby. Plus they like the rivalry factor of Rangers/Flyers (which they will show twice this year).
bD9tNbSaaa	HMMMMMMMMMMMM Cena (by one second count out)|`|7ImGw976aa	Most likely Cena would win, but I wouldn't be happy about it, darn Cena.|`|KVTW6mCzaa	Well Cena of course. The Brookylyn Brawler waz made to be a jobber. In real life, the BB would kick Cenaz Azz|`|2e3741216767a389faecfd74b525fe41aa	Your parents must be sooo ashamed of you.|`|BAurzDXtaa	The Brooklyn Brawler|`|zhk8o514aa	Lets ask the people who wrote the script.

Every finals he has taken his team to they've won...|`|0iBZj2zuaa	Didn't the 86 Lakers lose to the Celtics in the finals? I'd go with Lakers  in 7 games. Magic would rise to match Jordan, although Jordan would outperform him statistically. Put Cooper on Pippen, and the Lakers would edge the Bulls in the rest of the match ups. The overwhelming skill of Jordan and Pippen would extend this to 7 games, but the Lakers would exploit their matchups to win the series.|`|WlTTrx8aaa	hmmm did they get rodman yet?think he came 96-98 years but anyways if rodman was on the team then yes bulls would win his defensive prowness will but a stop to worthy and would remove some boards from kareem. plus no one can stop jordan defensively on the lakers ( no one in lakers history could stop jordan. present of future regardless of triple triple teams) but w/o rodman they would lose.<br>  with rodman:bulls win 4-2<br>  w/o rodman:bulls lose 4-2|`|fO7uk1jTaa	Answer:  Bull<br>  Reason:  Micheal Jordan nuff said|`|lMDy8W0Raa	Bulls.|`|4VPrEH8aaa	86 Lakers, easily
BIyJUmM9aa	I think Blazers can beat the Lakers.<br>  but Kobe does not suck<br>  <br>  :)|`|bmL7Ryw2aa	Well, I get the feeling you are syaing that because you don't like Kobe and the Lakers.  The Lakers have been breaking streaks all season, and will be looking to further establish their dominance on the road.  So that's why i feel they will win tonight.<br>  <br>  Kobe is 18th on the all time scoring list and currently leads the best team in the NBA.  How does he suck again?|`|2db7f31f8de2a63df2848a630426eea7aa	Lakers love to break streaks.|`|EKF2HdZKaa	no u arent the only one<br>  i got the blazers in an upset|`|7v9cjUxgaa	BLAZERS ARE MY TEAM!<br>  reppppin!<br>  <br>  home court advantage too!<br>  BLAZERS will win! we need the win too!<br>  this game would be so much fun to be at.<br>  i want to go to the game on april 10th!<br>  <br>  & i dont hate kobe because he's a great player and hottt!!!|`|8VeiQNRBaa	I think blazers have a chance.  Everybody plays extremely well against teams like lakers and cavs and celetics because they are the best.  IF you can catch them off guard you deffinetly have a chance!|`|QJgcwXzxaa	I do because of what you said AND the Lakers have struggled at the Rose Garden so will probably lose, but I won't be shocked if the Lakers win however.|`|014d662e9ccdcc2dfcbd68b27f469d57aa	I think they will win. only because they are the under dog.|`|AjD6Vm8Saa	Trail blazers are iight but im going with Lakers|`|GY3QTszgaa	kobe dont suck and the blazers have a chance but lakers will win|`|C4mzZwiWaa	stop dreamin my friend, wake up...|`|21J0IIZbaa	Lakers will have trouble but still win 99-95|`|BTZ4vFKJaa	lakers will win. kobe fucks
fdf78d43fe1121f9be25f88e4fef9e3baa	If I had to choose one of those forks for all of those applications I'd take the Duro. <br>  <br>  When attempting to cover all of your "bases" you should opt for the one that will handle the worst of what you are planning which in this case is probably the dirt jumping.|`|Ta98Ii1aaa	Definitely Duro, because it's designed for hardcore riding.<br>  <br>  Epicon also can be used, but not as durable as Duro. Epicon is more for cross country or cross country trail or light free ride use.<br>  <br>  If you do a lot of dirt jumping, I would suggest you to take Duro.

LOL....<br>  <br>  Yeah, he does "hulk up" in his matches...but to no avail.  I think that he should have stuck to refereeing.  He won't get anywhere as a wrestler.  In all honesty...|`|8TW00N9Daa	No, Shane Sewell is just another guy just like everybody on the roster of TNA!|`|1JywgkyMaa	i think he's hulk hogan and earl hebner mixed into one|`|z6enccBKaa	WHO the hell is that and whats TNGAY|`|6rXafFkFaa	no he doesnt have the same charisma
chw3rE7yaa	I would go with the Easton Elite because it is lighter and more durable but the Mac Daddy is also a good stick. In the end go with the one that you like more.|`|QsQLXuBzaa	a one 90
7ImGw976aa	Kozlov. He looks clueless half the time and doesn't really have much of a character.|`|Q1MI6L96aa	Orton - to erase Brock as the "youngest ever" champ...I don't think he has ever fully recovered from that push well before he was ready to carry the company.|`|bLhTwPqIaa	I think Kofi Kingston, I do like him, but i was really suprised when he showed up at Night Of Champions and beat Chris Jericho for The IC Title, I know he had help from HBK, but still suprised he was there let alone win it. Then we had him qualifying for The Elimination Chamber for The World Title, nowhere near time for him to be a contender for that title, glad he was not in it in some ways.|`|sqfjfR3iaa	1) Cody Rhodes, because he was the son of the American Dream.

xvuAQ0DAaa	What quintuple? the World Club championship can't be counted as a serious trophy, it's just a one-off game for the benefit of FIFA, TV and their corporate sponsors.  It's not a tournament or League series,  I'd rank it with the Charity / Community shield at best.  Lastly there's no way Man Utd are going to get a clean sweep this season, it's too many games at this stage of the season. I see them adding the EPL, but not the FA Cup or CL. This team isn't even one of the strongest Man Utd sides.  They have benefited more by their rivals' problems than outstanding play. Does anyone outside of Man Utd fans, really believe they would be doing so well if LIverpool, Arsenal and Chelsea had been able to field full strength teams most of the season?|`|d99GIH9Uaa	No!,, I'll cry when he leaves =[<br>  <br>  I Hope he goes on till he's 90odd [fingers crossed]|`|cjNtjOZtaa	No, the old man will be there until he dies.|`|tIBZ9Gi3aa	European Super Cup.He lost that one this season.|`|Wv0UKUdiaa	Only ONE trophy counts.....

Not that he hasn't already to me !|`|kDDwYkQUaa	They will not win the quintuple.<br>  <br>  He should retire at the end of next season.<br>  <br>  The silverware will be:<br>  <br>  Premier League: Man u<br>  Community Shield and Carling cup: Man u's already<br>  No1 cares bout the club world cup<br>  F.A cup: Chelsea<br>  Champions League: Chelsea :D|`|IWM1khX7aa	IF they win the quintuple.

Not until he is too tired to work, he shouldnt quit. Man United will be nothing without him.|`|LdJFFvSVaa	Who says your going to win the quintuple?
06sCVEdfaa	Did you read the Jim Litke (AP writer) article on Yahoo.  On how Charles Barkley ought to be a role model??   Puhleeze.  Not only did Charles drive drunk but he was also caught soliciting a prostitute and the police  and media have covered it up.  WAKE UP people and see what Charles Barkley really is.  Another disgusting sports player with no morals or character.  Don't you dare hold him up to me as a role model Litke.  How much did you get paid to write the article???|`|32zBW5uCaa	He did not.

I really don't know!!!|`|80406b09be06a3c558ae7d1bd7402e98aa	I do not think so, but I have seen hitters make the first two outs in an inning.|`|24e1a7bc7a99de5c51c57e1c16692780aa	I dont know of anyone doing it professionally, but one of my teammates did it last weekend... that inning he was 0-3 with three backward K's... ouch.

ETurhACOaa	Rampage won by Unanimous decesion at the end of the 3rd round in my opinion it was a disappointing fight, rampage's next fight is against rashad evans for the light heavy weight title|`|hQj1s1Maaa	Rampage via unanimous decision
mKtGiuyZaa	that's what happens when they have people who can't wrestle, wrestle.|`|oAjbBLDpaa	Yes it was real. The ref was unaware of what to do and instead of ending the match immediately, he risked Candice Michelle's body even more by telling Beth to drag her out and pin her. The ref made the bad call in that situation.|`|mJvZhdAuaa	It was the ref's call as to whether or not to finish the match, he instructed Phoenix to move her and finish with the pin.  According to <a href="http://oversight.house.gov/documents/20081231140942.pdf," rel="nofollow">http://oversight.house.gov/documents/200...</a> the ref was later fired as he was actually the one "in charge" and had the responsibility of calling the match and getting help.|`|yEsw7UkWaa	Yeah that was real.<br>  It is said that the wrestlers should stay in character as they need to get the story over with the viewers. <br>  When a legit injury happens though the other wrestler will usually wrap up the match quickly, so as not to prolong the potential damage.<br>  You will usually see the ref relaying info to the other wrestler/s involved in the match, telling them if the injured party can continue and if they should "skip" to the end of the script.<br>  It's up to the injured wrestler if they continue with the whole match (Cena has done this as has HHH) or if they skip to the end (more will opt for this as it means less time on the shelf and less chance of further injury)|`|uS8hK7Zhaa	That was very much real. At one point you can hear the ref say something like "Just pin her", so the match would be over with.<br>  <br>  You can't blame Beth for staying in character, it's her job. And she's not a doctor so she didn't know the severity of Candice's condition at that point.|`|IzgJpVgBaa	yep beth and the referee who was instructed 2 do this got told off by vince<br>  <br>  <br>  btw candice has reinjured her ankle|`|R4dXxh6paa	Yeah, I agree with the first guy, when you see them like WTF!, it's serious.|`|S1Cwexaiaa	the ref asked her was she ok and she must have said no so he just finished the match, kind of like what happened when stone cold broke his neck, he just crawled over and very poorly pinned owen hart (not that you can blame him since his neck was just broken from a piledriver)|`|IVEdWA2uaa	She just pulled her over and pinned her.  No harm done..so she was supposed to do that so they can hurry and and finish the match.|`|EJMtFvq4aa	When everyone looks awkward and has a WTF? look on there face<br>  then you know its a real injury.
ODAoukIgaa	No doubt, he is a brave player <br>  but i think he need s to quit and its time for him to put all his skills in new generation i mean to say he should start coaching..... best of luck to him|`|QS8dxkFyaa	Well I will say personally I prefer for him to hang in there and play for a couple more season. If he cant still hit the ball he can play. Look this example (Randy johnson)  San Francisco Giant Starting pitcher he is 45 years old and he is still playing. So in other words theres no age in baseball as long as you can hit your few shots here in there you can play.|`|WlFIXJSeaa	He needs to get juiced up like A-Rod and Mark McGuire!|`|0q7Wiiliaa	grrr|`|nYF9DCB8aa	brave<br>  <br>  answer mines<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AlxYpvOSy1Qy1waL37.8tNHsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090309140045AAFgh2k">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|EBnofxgpaa	Not necessarily either.<br>  Maybe he just loves it so much he doesn't care whether he is good or not.<br>  Passion isn't about talent.|`|KLKcVwOQaa	brave and embarrassing|`|C6VPSWluaa	brave. he should dictate when he wants to leave the game and he should do it on his terms|`|a9x4o0mFaa	i think that is a truly brave thing to do|`|FC34jxiaaa	You think it is "brave" for Griffey to make millions of dollars for batting .250 and spending half of his time on the DL? What is so "brave" about that? If I offered you $2-4 million to play professional baseball this year, what would you say? Even if you've never hit a baseball in your life and would strikeout more than Adam Dunn wearing a blindfold, you would say yes. It doesn't take a lot of bravery to say "yes, I'll take your money."<br>  <br>  BTW, anyone who believes that Griffey will "return to form" at age 39 is an idiot. Athletes don't peak at 39 unless they are good friends with Greg Anderson. Griffey's best days are well behind him.

e0M5lpc2aa	I don't think you should do this.<br>  <br>  Depending on what league format, not having A Rod to start the season could put you in a hole, or a bigger hole. Granted A Rod is a great player to have on a fantasy team but he has had some injury trouble, and is having surgery now. It may be minor and only 6-9 weeks, but a setback and we are looking even more.<br>  Youk is a 3B with great numbers, who many are projecting to get better numbers this year, and he's hot right now in the WBC. I say he's more a keeper than A Rod because of that. Also, Youk has 1B versatility meaning that come draft time, you don't need to make sure you have a 1B, but you can take the best 1B or 3B left.<br>  If you are going to drop one of Magglio or Youk, I say drop Ordonez, and bag this trade. Besides, if you still have a draft, you should probably have some good players to fill your lineup with anyways.<br>  <br>  Also, depending on how much more time there is until your draft, I'd say keep an eye on A Rod. If everything looks green, you can do this trade. But at the first sign of a setback, don't do this. See if you can't wait this trade out before you have more information. But overall my suggestion is to not do this.|`|Gm1xk05Baa	id say do the trade. so what if you do bad the first part of the season, that doesnt matter. once arod comes back he'll start hitting homeruns quicker than you can say steroids. your offense will quickly explode, and as soon as you know it youll be at the top of your league. of course thats hard to say since i dont know the rest of your team. but if you have decent pitching and a few other good bats in your lineup you will succeed.|`|OXHLqBuwaa	i think you should keep your players. but a-rod is hert and he will be out for 6 weeks, and its better to have players that play the whole season than 3 quarters.|`|i9eAnKsBaa	i wouldnt take the trade|`|bJXrQexmaa	well duh|`|AA11720887	This won't be a popular answer but keep Youkilis. ARod is going to have the media dogs hounding him after he comes back from surgery. Too many distractions. Kevin is a stud and improving each year.|`|3mZyMnjfaa	yeah i think a-roid is primed to have a big year he has to prove that he can hit without steroids but u have to keep in mind that he will be missing a month or two of the season and could possibly be out the entire season
b299edc40bfec7da51e76575d6b08d9daa	because the people that make these laws don't know the difference|`|5oUyPxuuaa	as far as i know (having been a retailer of both in the US) you must be 18 years old to purchase either and air pistol or crossbow. you can purchase both of them online but of course you must provide proof of age. I myself have purchased air powered firearms online in the past and do remember that i had to prove that i was over 18. typically this means using a credit card.|`|89vzbEbXaa	dunno where abouts in the world you are, but in the uk the law is the same.<br>  <br>  i suppose it is because idiots shoot people with pellet guns, and you don't hear much about crossbows. <br>  <br>  it's all political|`|dfBwVxXFaa	how old are you??  must be 18 to purchase either one.|`|cbp7Gukbaa	You can buy an airpistol in person at the shop because they have to take a few details so that if you break the law with it they can trace it back to you,an air pistol can be used as a concealed weapon.You also have to sign the book.You cant sign the book online.If you really want one you have no choice but to find the nearest airgun shop and go there personaly.Lucky for me there is one in my city not far from where i live so i didnt have to travel far to get an air pistol.I bought a crosman 2240 and i love the little thing.As for crossbows i have no idea.You dont hear many reports of people miss using crossbows so the laws are relaxed and the people who mainly use them use them for sport.|`|PnS3wHQiaa	You CAN buy an air pistol online. What makes you think you can't?

RAW has been good without him and the return of Batista, I think, could lose viewers|`|1z7M3Tntaa	I don't wacth WWE that much anyway so I could care less,  Batista doesn't add anything to WWE anymore so no im not anticipating at alll|`|O6VTWYDtaa	no one|`|aXdGCbEDaa	I think that Batista is a decent wrestler,but lacks mic skills and has a bit of an attitude problem outside of the ring.However,I'm interested in seeing how he'll go into the Triple H vs RKO storyline.He still needs to get payback on RKO after he got the "kick of doom" from Orton.He said that he could already go back into the ring, but he wants to heal completely first.However,seeing as how HBK is busy with Undertaker,and Cena is busy with Edge and Big Show,that leaves Batista,so it looks like before Mania,Batista may pop out and go after Orton for a few minutes then go back in his hole until after Mania.Also,remember the Two Man Power Trip?AKA Triple H and Stone Cold?Maybe Stone Cold will beat down Legacy if they attack Hunter and then go after Jericho.I don't know,but whether or not Batista gets involved,these storylines are getting pretty good.I can't wait till 'Mania!<br>  <br>  <br>  So..... HHH+Batista+Orton w/Legacy=Evolution Reunion?|`|IMu3wBu8aa	Batista doesn't injure Wrestlers...<br>  <br>  Anyway, I'm looking forward to his return. It should be interesting. I'm sure after this rest, he will be in top form.

There was rumors he might come out of retirement, but I think he has decided against coming back.

VoEf58UHaa	How do you memorize anything?<br>  Repetition, repetition, let me repeat that, repetition<br>  I think you're asking for swing-thought magic to help you perfect your swing. That's very difficult in this forum. Hands-on training would be your best option. If that's not possible buy a Medicus Dual Hinged Driver, you can get one for $150 - $160, and you will find how much works need to be done. Your annoying backswing will be a thing of the past.|`|1onXs5gPaa	Practice. practice, practice. Good luck.|`|YwM8Z14oaa	Find something you can swing against.. like a wall, where your club has to follow up the path of the wall, and not go off line.  THis is what the Medicus is trying to teach so you could try that. <br>  <br>  But now they have these giant hoop things that you swing along, but wall will work.<br>  <br>  You can then also try facing the wall and using that.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.  Just practice alot and it will become habit. <br>  <br>  Practice makes pefect.. No, Practice makes perement.|`|eENOmz5Laa	All in all, practice and repetition
Y4mz8BShaa	Because the tighter the bore, the lower the tolerances. If there's a seam, or even a few grains of sand in your barrel, and you're using a 6.01mm, it's going to jam, and you'll have to clear and clean the barrel in the field. They can also have some adverse effects on accuracy.<br>  <br>  Brands do matter, but MadBull produces great budget inner barrels, as does JBU.<br>  <br>  6.03mm for best results.|`|268Rwp6zaa	Getting something to be as exact as .01 of a mm takes lots of precise machining and time, and everybody knows that time=money. Plus, you must clean a 6.01 barrel after every use to keep it functioning. Even the smallest obstruction can screw it up. Plus if you get a BB that is 5.98 +/- .01mm, with a 6.01 barrel, that could leave just .02 mm (That's 2 hundredth of a mm, which is incredibly small) between it working and getting stuck, that is if the company did the quality that they said they did.<br>  <br>  So the main things are time=money (costs more to buy) and the very low area for mistakes. Plus constant maintenance.<br>  <br>  I have heard a lot about what brand sucks and what doesn't, but I don't see how big of a difference it could be. I mean a 6.03 is a 6.03, right? I don't think you do. You certainly don't need a DBC or even Prometheus (but I have heard good things about Promy). I'm sure a CA, Madbull, Systema ect would do just as well or close to it.

And by the way, did you read the articles.  Its says in the ESPN one, that if they change their scoring system even slightly, USC is at the top of their chart.  And the soonersports site talks about not only their record, but home record as well.  With the schedule that they play, who couldn't win 24 home games in a row.

Or better yet, when was the last time they played a top 10 team on the road, out of conference?|`|XCwjsfz2aa	You answered your own question. Yes there is bias, yes you are biased.

I get alot of **** on here b/c im an Ohio State fan. And i think you are a little bias also because you have "I mean, you can still love your team even though OU is better." In their eyes and mind the team they like is the best. I think your argument has many flaws.

It will only go up if there is a ban and it can only go down if they allow us  to continue to mfg thousands of AR's everyday as in the recent past. And we all know about the assault rifle ban that will soon discontinue mfg of all assault rifles in the US. I assume the hi-cap mags will be banned from manfuacturing as well but they will never be banned from ownership and the one you have now will be grandfathered in to the upcoming ban if it ever happens. Keep it, sell it in 6yrs+ if you must sell it and by that time it will either have gone up alot or just a little|`|f3f63c87e27f64c3e9f1679c165409b8aa	The others are right, the serial number won't play a role in it's value.<br>  I know that others may disagree but I'd not sure the price of AR's will rise a noticeable amount if there is an "assault weapons ban".  First of all, there has NEVER been a ban on these type weapons.  The only ban has been on accessories to these type weapons such as 30 rd mags, collapsible stocks, bayonet lugs, etc...the rifle themselves have never been banned.  Be that as it may, I personally don't believe the prices will raise much more.  Reason being is that I believe those that want an AR or AK have already purchased one, or are in the process of purchasing one.  If they don't want or see the need for one when it costs $1300 then they are not going to be willing to pay for them at a higher price.  Hope I'm wrong because I have numerous that I'd like to sell if prices do increase.  But I seriously doubt it.|`|famao81gaa	Yes. But you won't want to sell it.

AA11421008	I'd say somewhere around 20 perhaps more, but it's hard to tell. He's not as fast as Crosby and Kunitz, so he seems more likely, most of the time, to set up a goal for one of them and get an assist rather than a goal. There have already been a few times where his line mates try to pass him the puck, but he just can't get to it-- which is to be expected, because he is considerably older than both of them. I think the more interesting question is how many more assists will he have.|`|XuGFt3boaa	I say around 20 to 25.

In my opinion there is WAY less talent now individually, but there are better teams now.  Its odd to think of it that way but its kinda true.  I mean in the 90s you KNEW the Bulls would win the title probably every year.  In the 80s there were like 4 teams that had a chance.  In my opinion, Jordans era  wasnt the 80s, it was the 90s.   I remember the Bulls getting poudned in some playoff series in the 80s. Its kind of the same now!    Several teams have a shot. Good question|`|f7OHg8PCaa	Jordan, no matter what era, is the king of basketball. Yeah, there are some good players like James and Bryant but they aren't as good as Jordan.

The bagel is good, but maybe not enough, perhaps double up on it, and add a protein shake as well (this will also give you a little fat).  <br>  <br>  You just need to be eating MORE.  A balanced meal, with more of everything!  A balanced breakfast with plenty of grains and protein will keep you from feeling hungry for longer, making it easier to get to lunch without your stomach grumbling, and will help your muscles recover from that morning workout.|`|rxScdXM4aa	eat some protein...eggs.<br>  and have a fruit. they provide healthy long lasting energy thru the natural sugars. a banana is always good or maybe some fresh pineapple.<br>  <br>  if you are eating carbs make sure they are whole grains...they provide energy as well as fiber.|`|atQgZ9ofaa	I swim and after my morning practices I eat a big serving of carbs (you are already doing this w the bagel) and some fruit.

EmYNUZcXaa	i dont know what that tred guy is talking about, but you will RUIN your blades if you attempt to sharpen your skates with sand paper!! most pro shops will sharpen your skates for $15. just go get them professionally done. its cheaper then buying new blades because you used sand paper on them.|`|gbkCpn21aa	No (where did tred get that silly idea from?)....you should ask around at your local ice rink and see if they offer skate sharpening services. Get your skates sharpened about every 40 hrs of skating. You can not sharpen the skates with a simple knife sharpener or sandpaper, as it will destroy the blades.|`|PNFnZGrpaa	Do NOT use sandpaper to sharpen your skates.  Chances are you will ruin your skates.  Most ice rinks have a pro shop.  Just go in and ask the person to sharpen your skates.|`|rc8gYyfcaa	ABSOLUTELY DO NOT SHARPEN YOUR SKATES YOURSELF! <br>  get them done by a professional. it will improve your skating ability, and you could ruin your blades...|`|HxwCiCH6aa	No you shouldn't sharpen your skates with sand paper!

There do not seem to be any corners (Jenkins is debatable) worthy of the #9 selection; if Orakpo were to fall to them, he would be tough to pass on.|`|Rro38GQhaa	Rodgers is fine he was in the top 8 qbs in every category they better not take a qb I also think Raji is the best pick but if he is gone they should look at the linebacker from usc|`|ex5HgM1aaa	a corner|`|cd51ab07fbecfef33f286305112484c4aa	Everette Brown, Brian Orakpo, guys that can play OLB in the 3-4 that the Packers are trying to implement.|`|0093382286e191b54fe019326d1aa456aa	BJ Raji|`|CL7OTeiCaa	They won't take a quarterback.

oFMCWge3aa	Alot of people have this problem, sometimes it is because ou are too straight or you a re very tense. RELAX! <br>  <br>  In the rising trot, you make an up and down movement on each stride, going up  on beat one, and down on beat two. You should allow the horse's movement to throw his or her seat a bit out of the saddle, then allow the PELVIS TO MOVE FORWARD == NOT UP!! You should not simply throw the shoulders forward (which will disrupt the movement of the horse). When coming back down, the seat should touch down lightly, rather than slamming down on the horse's back, and the hip angle will close slightly. You will land back on the saddle with more weight on the pelvis and less on the seat bones. <br>  <br>  The shoulders and lower legs should remain in relatively the same position when you are both forward (up) or sitting (down), with the pelvis moving between the two. In order to stay with the motion of the horse, your shoulders should maintain a slight forward incline throughout the rising trot, instead of the upright, vertical position seen in sitting trot.<br>  <br>  It is the upper part of your pelvis that moves forward and your back and head do not move up, down or sideways - back and neck stay straight and still - Hopefully!<br>  <br>  Hope this helps you!! xx

92df82e95b3b1086d69d36994ca2effdaa	Ok, you pushed a generally accepted recreational recommendation.  BUT there is not nearly enough information to even begin to speculate on why you have this pain.  First off, the best source for information in this case would be DAN (Divers alert network) Here is a link to one of their articles about flying after diving:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.diversalertnetwork.org/medical/articles/article.asp?articleid=20" rel="nofollow">http://www.diversalertnetwork.org/medica...</a><br>  <br>  There are many other questions that would need to be asked / answered such as your max depths, your bottom time, your profile, your general level of health, what other activities were you up to?  It was a Friday night / if you were up late partying all night and alcohol was involved you could be at more risk than if you drank plenty of water and went to bed early.<br>  <br>  So realize that there are many factors, including hauling heavy scuba equipment and luggage around and being in the very bad environment of the airplane it self.<br>  <br>  The smart thing here would be to either visit your doctor if it is bothering you, or start with a call to DAN.  They will ask you questions and may give you some advice as to if it was diving related, and if you should see a doctor that is more aware of diving related injuries or if your regular doctor is enough.  At this point you are not/ or no longer bent, and you won't be getting a chamber ride...   <br>  <br>  It's your health so don't consider it being paranoid...  Good luck!|`|pdQuOHngaa	Are you certified? This is one of the big no-no's in diving. This could definitely be a result of diving and flying. There is a 24 hr. minimum decompression time between diving and flying- this is not a rule you want to bend or break. Go see a doctor.|`|9AloxUHLaa	Generally speaking that is too soon to fly after diving. You are 5hrs too early. 24 hrs before flying is the best. The pain is coming from faster rate off gassing of Nitrogen. You need to rest - you may have to see a physician familiar with decompression sickness. I hope you come out of it without too much problem. Check the attachment I have included from NOAA.gov.|`|UW0udNzfaa	Please go see a doctor, you broke one of the cardinal rules of diving.

The appropriate response, if verbal communication is not halting the activity, is to deck him.  As soon as you think he is going to attempt to touch you in any way, rear back, close your fist, and plant one in his eye.  This will let him know you mean business.<br>  <br>  Contrary to popular believe, it is acceptable to hit people as long as the situation calls for it.

Z5xgSATSaa	If you are only going to ride to school and do a little off road riding, that bike is totally unsuitable. It will be a dog to ride on the street, heavy and slow, and will probably break down very soon off road. There is no way a dual suspension bike that sells under $100 will stand up to any trail riding, unless the trails are as smooth as a road. If you must have suspension, you will have to spend quite a bit more|`|JSGLKnA4aa	go to brand name bike sites you'll find spec's there. buy from local bike shop they'll have all the info you need.|`|mJFgCvYlaa	That bike will hardly be considered as "intermediate". Go to a real bike store that sells only bikes, then you can see what you can consider. Your jaws would drop seeing how much more quality bikes are in a real store.<br>  <br>  If you want to stick to mountain biking, stay with hardtail bikes (ones without suspension in the rear), or, you can look into road bikes if you are riding exclusively on road and for commuting. You can also look into hybrids as well as something in between. Be sure to ask a shop salesperson for guidance.|`|DOVbF4Piaa	You link doesn't work so here it is.  That bike is going to be a piece of junk for  $89.99.

bGWcSAGCaa	Linear "V" brakes, with the exception of mini-V's, operate with brake levers that pull more cable than the levers used with centerpull cantis.  Some people convert to V's without switching levers, but the brake pads must be set so close to the rim that the bike may not be ridable if the rims get the slightest bit out of true.<br>  <br>  The best bet would be to install compatible levers.  If your levers are integrated with your shifters (thus requiring more $), you can install travel agents (which will modify the pull ratio) or check out the possibility of mini-V's.<br>  <br>  Also, take a look at the brake cable stops on your frame.  You need to either have a stop that will accept the short length of cable housing going to the rear brake, or you will need to run a continuous length of housing from the brake lever to the rear brake.|`|Z5xgSATSaa	I just did the same thing on the front brake of my mountain bike. I installed a new fork which would not work with the canti brakes I had on my old fork. Fortunately, I happened to have a travel agent to modify the pull ratio for the v brakes I installed on the new fork. However, if you don't have a travel agent for each v-brake you install, buying them might be as expensive as buying new brake levers. So, if you have separate shift and brake levers, buying new brake levers for the v-brakes might make sense|`|JSGLKnA4aa	not unless the canti levers are V compatable.

evIyZ49Vaa	It's a great sport that can hold your interest for a lifetime - there's always more to learn and new ways to get involved.  Dinghies to ocean racers, quiet lakes to rounding Cape Horn, day-sailing, racing, cruising, etc.<br>  <br>  It's best to learn on a small boat in sheltered waters (like the lake), because although the principles of sailing are the same regardless of boat size, you learn the essentials more easily on a smaller boat that is more responsive.<br>  <br>  No tests are required to sail, or even own a boat, although both national sail training organizations - US Sailing and ASA, offer various levels of certification along with their courses.<br>  <br>  Try searching around on USSailing.org - you might be able to find a school nearby.  If not, take a week's vacation and go somewhere where you can get lessons.  There are also some good learn-to-sail books to get you started.  US Sailing's "Start Sailing Right" is a good one (I might be slightly off on the title).<br>  <br>  Finally, look around for local boats who might need someone to help crew.  Being a rookie is not a negative - many skippers prefer crew who will do things their way and don't have a know-it-all attitude.  Bringing a six pack and a bag of chips along doesn't hurt either!|`|kOoCya9Oaa	Many community colleges offer sailing courses or can direct you to someplace that does.

Make sure you or someone knows how to assemble them. If price is not your biggest factor then I suggest that you opt out of both of these in favor of a bike shop built bike that will cost a bit more but will be worth the money you spend. The first one is NOT a full suspension bike that you can ride off road and will say as such when you get it, I guarantee that! You must be certain that you are getting a bike that fits you and you cannot do that when buying a bike online unless you have years of experience ridding and you KNOW what you are buying and that does not appear to be the case with you.

PaWcj0AIaa	Answer<br>  Throughout history people have played sports involving ball and using hands, feet and sticks. <br>  <br>  Each local area had their own rules so there was no definitive global definition of any sport. <br>  <br>  In the 1300's the king of England Edward III banned football, hockey and handball. This shows a difference between sports using the feet, hands and sticks. So football was traditionally played using the feet and not the hands. <br>  <br>  In 1863 at Cambridge university a group of Englishmen formed the Football Association and invented football. <br>  <br>  After this event many other "versions" of football were invented. Rugby and Australian rules were the first. In north america rugby and football were both played, and a hybrid of these two sports was invented called Gridiron (american football) <br>  <br>  The first sport called football with global rules is football, other sports using the term football have words placed in front such as rugby, Gridiron (american) or Aussie Rules (Australian) or Gaelic (Irish) to differentiate them from football. <br>  <br>  There remains only one football accepted by FIFA and the Olympic committee. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Answer<br>  The origin of football is not an easy question to answer. There was renaissance football (Galileo was supposed to be a pretty good player) and various other forms of rugby/football in various cultures at various times in history. What we consider the first game of Gridiron (american football) as we know it was playing during a game in 1869 between McGill University of Montreal and Harvard. When several players were unable to continue the Association Football match (soccer) the number of players was reduced to 11 and McGill rules were used. This is considered to be the first time what we call Gridiron (american football) was played. Walter Camp was a great self-promoter who tried to milk Yale for as long as he could through many corrupt practices. Yale to this day would never admit that Harvard invented anything and Harvard would never admit that the boys from McGill taught them anything. The modern line (7 men on the line of scrimmage) was brought about due to several s from the Wedge formation and flying wedge formation that were being used by Harvard et al. In 1906, the rules were changed as the behest of Teddy Roosevelt. So who exactly invented Gridiron (American football)? Walter Camp claimed to invent everything but he didn't invent Gridiron. However he was a great admirer of the NZ rugby genius, Thomas Ellison, who had influenced the direction of rugby during the 1880s and 1890s. Ellison also proposed a forward pass rule that was not permitted in rugby rules. Camp saw the brilliance in such as rule, and had enough authority to get it included into the early years when Gridiron (American football) game was just beginning. McGill? They introduced the rules that Harvard used and became modern Gridiron. The answer is no one person invented Gridiron (american football). There are so many innovations that have been introduced by so many people that it is unfair to credit any one person.<br>  Answer<br>  Gridiron (American football), distinct type of football that developed in the United States in the 19th century from soccer (association football) and rugby football. Played by professionals and amateurs (generally male college or high school teams), Gridiron is one of the most popular American sports, attracting thousands of participants and millions of spectators annually. The forerunner of Gridiron may have been a game played by the ancient Greeks, called harpaston. In this game there was no limit to the number of players. The object was to move a ball across a goal line by kicking, throwing, or running with it. Classical literature contains detailed accounts of the game, including its rougher elements, such as ferocious tackling. However, historians have debunked the Roman or Greek origins, claiming no one knows what the rules were and that many people have invented simply stories based around the ball carryiny artwork left by the Greek artists.<br>  Most modern versions of football, however, originated in England, where a form of the game was known in the 12th century. In subsequent centuries football became so popular that various English monarchs, including Edward II and Henry VI, forbade the game because it took interest away from the military sport of archery. By the middle of the 19th century football had split into two distinct entities because some British Public Schools developed their foot ball games into ball carrying games by copying the NZ Maori hand ball methods of play. Still popular today, these two sports included the football association game, or soccer (the word being a slang adaptation of the three letters, s-o-c, in Association), and rugby, in which players ran with the ball and tackled. Gridiron evolved out of rugby.<br>  Answer<br>  In most parts of the world, Football is soccer and the American game is known as Gridiron (American Football). Football (soccer) being the most popular|`|eWKG1gCPaa	china|`|kzYdVfifaa	The first American football game was played on November 6, 1869. The team representing Rutgers University defeated the team from the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University). Other colleges in the eastern United States (Columbia, Harvard, and Yale) soon added football to their athletic programs. Early games took place on a football field measuring 120 yards long and 75 yards wide, and players used a round, soccer-like ball|`|XCwjsfz2aa	According to legend, during a soccer game at the Rugby School in England (1823), a student named William Webb Ellis picks up the ball and runs with it...this led to a new game--rugby. 1863, the Football Association was formed (soccer)...8yrs later the Rugby Football Union....both sports spread to the U.S. by 1869. Nov. 6,1869 Princeton and Rutgers played the 1st recognized college football game...the 1st to score 6 goals would win. Princeton won 6-4. In 1876, the 1st American football rules were written at a convention in Springfield, Massachusetts. Its also the year Walter Camp (father of american football) entered Yale University. A star in the sport, he would be prominent in making changes in the rules making it more of what we see today. Example: 15 players on the field reduced to 11, and tackling (which was only legal above the waist) would also be below the waist. By the 1890s, football had spread nationally all over the northeast.

GyGhHpRraa	The Pirates are moving in the right direction.  3-4 years ago, we would've never signed Alvarez and just dumped him off for money.  We signed him, which is huge.  The pitching is not there, which is true.  We got some good players for Nady and Bay, and filled in alot of empty gaps.  <br>  <br>  You're correct.. maybe not .500, but on the right track|`|0f5cc27a5aca75cf6162b2cbb88fc13caa	I live in Dubois, PNC is the best park in baseball.  Im an Orioles fan but I do kinda pull for the Pirates. I feel bad for them geez.  I remember the early 90s when they were tearin it up, those were the days.  It cant get much worse so think of it that way!  The Pirates havent made the playoffs since what 92?   Baltimore was there in 97.  I actually went do see the Os play the Pirates in 04 or 05.  Jack Wilson hit a HR in the ninth to win the game for the Pirates|`|yk4S7uuraa	I'm a Mets fan, and I love PNC Park, and I really hope the Pirates start winning soon.<br>  <br>  Back in the 1960s, 70s and 80s, the Mets and the Pirates had a great rivalry that all went in the tank when they put Pittsburgh in the Central Division. The 1992 Pirates were the last divison winner.|`|FC34jxiaaa	What are the Pirates doing differently? They traded away their best players last year. Isn't that exactly what you would expect from the Pirates? They finished 17-37 (.315) after trading Bay and Nady, so they ended 2008 as bad as they've ever been. That doesn't seem too encouraging. They were wise to fire Littlefield after the idiotic Matt Morris trade, but I don't see any reason to doubt that they will continuing losing ~95 games a year for the foreseeable future.|`|Wx6yx6YMaa	I think that they are going to get .500 this year. Doumit and Mclouth had a breakout season last year. If Freddy can get back to his batting title form that would be amazing. The Laroach bro's will have 25 Hr's and over 80 Rbi's. The pitching will be better with Maholm,Snell, and Duke. The bullpen is great with Yates, Grabow, and Capps. They even have abunch of prospects in the minors like McCutchen, Walker, Alzarez, Tabata, and Daniel McCutchen. It's going to be a crazy year for the Buccos. The Rays were 17-8 last year in spring training, so far the Pirates are 9-4...they might be the new Rays.|`|B46t8gkLaa	eventually all those draft picks will come to the show. much like tampa last year. you just never know when. .|`|6T90F8mNaa	With the NL Central being a strong division, the Pirates, like you said, will most likely not get to the .500 mark. I am not ruling it out, but I don't think this is the year.<br>  <br>  However, they are going in the right direction, which I believe you were asking. This year, they weren't afraid to draft a big name player in Pedro Alvarez, and sign him, unlike past years. They actually signed Maholm and McLouth to build around, as they are some of the best on the team. Also, they are taking their time with Andrew McCutchen, a top prospect to help him get better in the minors.<br>  <br>  Right now, the Pirates are heading in the right direction. And by the way.....watch for Ryan Doumit this year, he is heavily underrated.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Spring Training records do not matter at all. In football, it is the exact same, with the Lions going 4-0 in the pre-season. Same thing in baseball. It doesn't matter. We'll see how they perform in the season.......|`|2V5hc4cUaa	I am greatly encouraged, they've got a lot of new talent this year namely McLouth and Maholm coming back, you've got Ryan Doumit and Freddy Sanchez coming up big in spring training. and let me tell you, living in Indiana and seeing Andrew McCutchen play, he is gonna be a superstar soon, let's just hope they keep him come his first pro contract signing.....maybe not .500 this year or any year soon, but winning is on its way back in Pittsburgh :D|`|8qH5q7TGaa	I live in Pittsburgh also, but in order to have a good team, it's all about PITCHING. Sure Maholm is a good 2 starter at best, not an ace, but Snell needs to pick up his game, because he can be a number 1 pitcher. Also, looking at things in relative, McLouth isn't a guy to build a team around. He's a good hustle player with some pop, but we need Alvarez or Tabata to pan out for sure
Kfh1UjfHaa	Well they sell bikinis seperately so I'd say buy a small for the bottom (or whatever size you are) and a Large for the top. <br>  I have the same problem as you except mine are bigger.

Just don't play in public, play in woods or backyard. If you don't have a backyard or woods then i consider going to a field. Also if the cops pull you over show them the airsoft bbs. And if they pull u over 2 times get a piece a paper and write your name airsoft gun. and tape it to it, it looks stupid but it helps.|`|cYkTuHHGaa	You could always get a clear airsoft gun in addition to the orange tip or paint your metal airsoft gun a color different than black.

That justifies the three draft picks and $54 million contract Dallas gave him.<br>  <br>  Patrick Crayton could start opposite Williams; but I have heard the Cowboys prefer Crayton in the slot. This means Miles Austin might finally be given a chance.<br>  <br>  Also don't rule out the Cowboys signing an inexpensive free agent; like old friend Joey Galloway.|`|bmL7Ryw2aa	Probably, especially if he has an entire offseason to work with the team.  But look for Romo to start spreading the ball around a little more.  So don't expect any Owens type numbers from Williams or anyone else this season.

The answer was that it wasn't the main sport, that "Gaelic football" and hurling were ahead of it in popularity.<br>  <br>  The answerer also said that Ireland's favorite soccer teams were Glasgow Celtic first, because of the Catholic influence, and Liverpool second, because it was the closest English city to Ireland and a lot of Liverpudlians are of Irish descent, including all 4 Beatles, and Gerry Marsden of Gerry & the Pacemakers -- hence Gerry sang "You'll Never Walk Alone" live at Celtic Park for a 2003 UEFA Cup match between Liverpool & Celtic.

AA12253571	The correct answer is Darryl Strawberry (Mets 83-90, Yankees 95-99, SF 99 and LA 91- 93) and Jose Vizcaino (Mets 94-96, Yankees 2000, SF 97 and LA 89- 90 and 98- 2000). <br>  <br>  I missed the "in name only" part in the beginning just like everyone else.|`|91dd90bc592f3359016be7d23fc02b3aaa	Anon got it.|`|0525a39d91f1af8426a354d87bd840b7aa	That is a great trivia Q.

He played for the Brooklyn Dodgers and New York Giants, and managed the Brooklyn Dodgers, New York Yankees and New York Mets.  (Stengel did not play in the short-lived - 1914 and 1915 - Federal League, a rival major league with a team in New York).
AA11515166	well the gloves should stay sticky on there own for awhile. but when they start gettin patchy, i usually spit on them a lot. but water works also. spit is more handy tho.|`|AA11408134	Remove the rubberize pads from ping pong paddles (or buy replacement pads).

8e0ac8865a39537b75bb5cd4f4b73ef8aa	You want to be able to control the ball well so practice that and other than that just build up ur endurance by doing long runs and ontinuous sprinting, strength always helps, no matter what sport ur playing|`|AA11515166	you need to be in shape to be able to play the whole game. your touches on the ball have to be good. make sure ur comfortbale with the ball on your feet, head and thighs and such. just practice|`|209172fa637fd708139bb71ac9c4e571aa	You must get a lot of practice and hire a coach  to train you.
d6a087fe1be8f56882b7d29c23f034d1aa	1. Start eating healthy. If you don't know how you should eat, then go to a physician and ask them, ask a personal trainer, or go to mypyramid.gov and get your pyramid plan. (All Events) <br>  2. Run at least three miles everyday, but make sure you stretch good after running. Before running, warm up by skipping with your knees coming up as high as your midsection. If you must stretch, don't over due it. You don't want your muscles too loose before running. If running three miles is hard for you (which it is hard for me!) than, don't feel bad. Just gradually increase your milage every week. For Example: Week one, run 1 mile everyday. Week two, run 1.5 miles everyday. Week three, run 2 miles everyday. Week four, run 2.5 miles every day, and week five, run three miles everyday. It could actually be better to gradually increase milage than just running three miles every day for all five weeks, because you are gradually increasing stanima and musclular ability. (All Events) <br>  3. If you live by a track, that will be very helpful for this step, as well as step two. Everyday, Sprint one hundred meters and mark your time. Then, Sprint two hundred meters and mark your time. Then run four hundred meters(which could be considered long distance or sprinting, it all depends) and record your time. Sometimes during the five weeks, you may see your times get either better or worse. If they get worse, work harder. If they get better, you are doing good. If they stay the same, then, whatever! No problemo.(Sprinting:100, 200. Sprinting/ Long Distance: 400.) <br>  4. If you are going to be a hurdler, then practice your hurdling. Make a hurdle, get one, or just hurdle a bench. Be very careful not to hurt yourself. Hurdling: 100 hurdles, 200 hurdles, 400 hurdles, etc> hurdles.) <br>  5. If you are going to do long jump, practice your bouncy sprint everyday. Make a jump pit, use a local one, or just jump in the grass;not recomended. (Long Jump.) <br>  6. For high jump, you can't practice without the track equipment. Throwers also need the correct equipment. Just wait for track season and stay very fit and healthy.(High Jump, shot-put, discus) <br>  7. Everyday run either 800 meters (two track laps on a 1/4 mile track)or one mile/1600 meters (four laps on a 1/4 mile track. (Distance: 800 meter, 1600 meter/ mile.) <br>  8. Soon, you'll be ready and in shape for track!|`|98ed12ee84ef048b3c19e2ac9c6c72aeaa	The first thing is all quick sprinters run on their toes. You will have to be good at the starting blocks. If you know how to get out of them fast you will be great. I did the hurdles my freshman year and its fun being in track. I hope that helps.|`|AA11417863	-Drink water ALL throughout the day. <br>  -Don't ditch practice <br>  -Practice running on you're own. Alternate between distance and <br>    sprinting. For example- jog the corners of the track and sprint<br>    the straits. Or jog for twenty minutes and sprint for two.<br>  -Eat healthy. Pasta is great the night before a meet.<br>  -Don't get discouraged at your times. There will always be room<br>    for improvement by anyone.<br>  -Make sure you know how to start correctly off the blocks. Finger <br>   push ups are painful, but pay off. (Ask your coach.)<br>  -Work on your running technique. Correctly, your upper body <br>   should be slighty ahead of your lower body. Take wide strides.<br>  -Drink lots of water!<br>  -Make sure your shoes are new and have plenty of support.<br>  -Nurse shin splints as soon as you feel them. Don't try to ignore <br>   them until you can't run any more. Ice and heat after practice.<br>  -Drink lots of water!<br>  <br>  Running the 100 is a difficult race, I think, because there is so much competition. Practice, practice, practice! I'm sure there will be many excersizes your coach will provide to help you improve, but remember practice doesn't stop as soon as you step off the track. Eat healthy and practice running on your own either before school or after practice. I found that my biggest thing was I would miss a few practices because I was extremely sore. Don't do this unless it's an extreme injury. If you stick with it <br>  and attend practice daily the soreness will go away.<br>  Beware of shin splints! Make sure your shoes are comfortable and have plenty of support. Same goes with your spikes, although they won't have as much support. But at the first sign of them, go to your athletic medic. They can be the end of your season if left unattended.<br>  And most important- don't get dehydrated! Downing two bottles of water right before practice isn't good. Drink water constantly <br>  throughout the day, you'll be thankfull when you don't have cotton mouth.<br>  <br>  Don't get discouraged and Good Luck this season!

jTaW3goeaa	I have to laugh at those that think snowboarding is easier, because its not.  I completely disagree with the comment that snowboarding is easier to perfect than skiing.  I guess those that say that have never been through snowboarding race training.  Snowboarding is harder to learn and harder to do. Skiing is for those that can't handle snowboarding <br>  <br>  As for your question about injuries, you can get hurt doing either one.  Certain riding styles put you at more risk of serious injuries.  For instance if you ride the park a lot you have a much bigger chance of getting hurt<br>  <br>  also the "If it were easy, it would be called skiing" comment is ridiculous as well.  Thats probably just something skiers say to feel better about themselves|`|DrzuDOD6aa	Yes and No. Snowboarding is easier in the long run, after you get the hang of carving and going down the hill. Skiing is easier to begin with, it's easier to stay upright and to go on the lifts, but the longer you to it, the harder it gets because you get more advanced and need to learn techniques. I love skiing so much more|`|jTFdG8xqaa	Skiing is a little more similar to walking and standing at least in the earlier stages. I find that for a begginer first time who has never skate boarded or wakeboarded, or surfed skiing is normally a little easier to get the hang of quickly at least in the early stages. Snowboarding on the other hand is a bit easier to get to an intermediate level quickely as stance and edge control are a little more defined by your board, where as skiing must be worked at a little harder. Both are equally difficult to reach an advanced level though. I would say start on the beginner hill on ski's just like you did with snowboarding. You may get the hang of it really quick or it might be really hard for you. Good luck and have fun...and you will probably fall less than you did snowboarding. Good luck!|`|rUtBicS4aa	I'm a snowboarder,in my opinion snowboarding is easier anbd more fun and you probably will to just because when you fall in ski's it is so hard to get up but going downhill on skis sometimes is fun.|`|pdQuOHngaa	"If it were easy it would be called snowboarding"<br>  K2 adds<br>  <br>  I agree with those that said skiing is easier to learn- but harder to master.<br>  <br>  Skiing is great! Good luck hopefully your not skiing in the mid west!|`|klUO7ayRaa	I think it's easier.|`|Xec6WGMhaa	Well, the general guidelines in this decision are:<br>  <br>  -SKIING is easier to learn but harder to master than SNOWBOARDING<br>  -SNOWBOARDING is harder to learn but easier to master than SKIING<br>  <br>  That's really all we know about the sports generally.<br>  However, there are some things such as wide turns which are easier on skis.<br>  <br>  Good Luck this weekend, and have fun!<br>  Hope this Helps!|`|a7SmdQCpaa	skiing- easy to learn hard to perfect<br>  snowboarding- hard to learn easy to perfect|`|7HdNA7dFaa	Skiing is definitely.

cKl8ZSrSaa	If people were truly jealous of Jr, then why not just become a fan of his? It's not very hard to pick a driver to like, there's nothing stopping anyone who may be jealous of him or anyone else in the sport. I don't understand what there is to be jealous of. If I were jealous of Jr. I would be jealous of the other 42 drivers as well that race every week. I don't see anything to be jealous of...he sure isn't out performing my favorite race car driver so it wouldn't be that. Maybe the people who think non-Jr. fans are jealous of him are the ones that are jealous because Jr. can't compete with most of todays competition, and they wish he was as good as many of the rest of them so they would have something more to cheer about each Sunday. I still don't understand how anyone could be jealous of him. Jealous of what is my question? If anything I feel sorry for not being very good, and his fans not being able to get excited for him since he doesn't run very well usually.|`|5d77c66b171b12a5932576b2dc7b7dd3aa	Mike_Burch.......................Do you have a mouse in your pocket???<br>  <br>  "We????"

I was/am a BIG SR fan so naturally I watched JR when he was in the bush series. I saw him be the first to win 2 championships and not only 2 but 2 in a row, I thought he was going to be the next big thing but so far all he has done in my opinion is let all his fans down.|`|p8JfOlTzaa	To put it bluntly we are just a bunch of rednecks.  I included myself in that phrase.  We Love to drink beer on sundays and watch the race.  If Ya really like a driver you'd almost fight to the death trying to sell your story.  Junior inherited his fans and that pisses alot of people off.  I could care less.  It's part of the fact to not jump on the bandwagon as we all know.  He sells tickets and does a decent enough job, so really who cares?  I watched his father for years when mark martin was trying to get the title only to see him get wrecked and lose it in the last race.

Good or Bad.<br>  <br>  That he had a ready made fan base because of his name. And that fan base grew exponentially with his ultra successful stint in The Busch Series, and the death of his father. While their driver has gained less popularity, even if they are winning more races.<br>  <br>  That even though he has only won 1 race in two years, he was able to sign a deal to drive with the most successful team, active today in NASCAR.<br>  <br>  That they are jealous of the fact, that if he wins or loses, his fans stay with him strongly. There isn't a very big drop off in support from year to year, like there is with some drivers. No matter how much they slam him and put him down, we keep cheering and that drives the haters nuts.|`|mIdcJEJNaa	Because they haven't been fans for twenty four months yet,<br>  and they haven't seen his better years..

He has stood up to this pretty well..<br>  BTW: I have noticed, that besides the usual suspects, the Kyle fans have decided they need to bash Jr, to make their driver look better, or something.. Puzzles me a little.. Who knows.. If Kyle doesn't pick things up a bit, maybe him, and Joey Lagono can open a restaurant together.. lol

HkMhWvtgaa	First, make sure you have a good backstop, large enough to stop even the wildest shots.  Stacked hay bales can work for that, or sandbags.  <br>  <br>  One cheap way to make a target to put in front of the backstop is to stuff a burlap gunny sack with plastic grocery bags.  You'll be amazed how many bags it can take to fill one, but if you ask friends and neighbors, you'll probably find someone who has been saving them for years and is glad to find a use for them.  <br>  <br>  For gunny sacks, try a farm supply store, or a farmer who might have used seed sacks.  If you can't find sacks, you can buy burlap cheaply at a fabric store.  Choose a loose weave, so that the point of the arrow can open a big enough space for the shaft without breaking the fibers.  You can make a sack by folding it once and stitching the two sides with twine threaded through a yarn-size needle.  Paint your target onto the burlap (spray paint is quick and easy, for a traditional bullseye), then stuff with plastic bags.  After stuffing, stitch the top, too.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind that a burlap target is best for target points or field points.  For judo points or broadheads, you will want a different type of target.  The professionally made targets are made from self-healing foam, but if you want something homemade, use wooden planks to make a 3-sided box, about 4 feet on a side.  Pour several sacks of sand (like you'd use in children's sandbox) into the box, and rake it up as a ramp with the low end at the open side of the box and the high end close to the top of the back wall.  Stake a paper target onto the ramp.  The arrows will pull right out of the sand, even with broadheads.  You'll go through a lot of paper targets, but they're cheap.<br>  <br>  Good shooting!|`|0tpLq6meaa	Haybales make a good target for your longbow, but keep them covered and dry. you can also use a plastic garbage bag and stuff it full of plastic bags such as the kind that the grocery stores use, but it takes a lot of them for that purpose. You can also use a mound of dirt or get a piece of carpet and hang it from a line or pole and it will stop the longbow arrows. Shooting a longbow is a blast, isn't it?|`|QC2NozBkaa	Couple or three hay bales are hard to beat.  Cheap and durable as long as you keep them dry.

You need to ask what do you want to shoot with it? If your shooting rabbits , forget it , if you need it to produce to your friends , forget it, Most 2.2 pistols are at best good for close vermin control, probably a good 1.77 would be better as the pellet in most cases has a higher velocity due to shooting a lesser amount of lead. I have a Tempest Hurricane 2.2 and must admit to being dissapointed with it, I hardly ever use it prefering to go with my rifles. Be very careful, in the current UK climate for Airweapons if you dont have a "shoot" to use it , then there is a good chance Police will want to have a serious word.

ojIkIdAUaa	A pontoon boat can be used on the ocean as well as a lake.  They are actually quite stable in rough waters (up to a point).  However, it starts to get unsafe the further you get from shore.  If you plan on taking long trips away from shore, then a pontoon boat is probably not the best thing for you.|`|qubLyvcRaa	This answer is from a non-boater.  However, I'm buying a pontoon this spring and have done a lot of research.  I'd be putting mine in the Hudson River about 75 miles north of NYC.  While very stable, they're easy prey for strong winds.  Most pontoon boats are "displacement" vessels; thIat is to say, they're powered through the water w/o getting up on plane.  In even 2 foot sea, I believe this ould be a problem.  I've asked about pontoons in the ocean, and the answer is universally "no" just because the dynamics of the ocean are so much more extreme than a lake or river.  I have, however, seen them on the bay side of the ocean but not very often.  Finally, I'd wonder if the aluminum pontoons would be damaged by corrosion in a salt environment.  There are a couple of companies that make fiberglass deck boats which might be more appropriate for the ocean.

If you lack the experience and tools to do this properly, take your bike to a competent mechanic.<br>  <br>  With a threaded headset, you want the top locknut to be able to securely tighten against the spacer(s).  If the cut steerer is the slightest bit too long, it won't seat securely...and there is greater risk of the lower adjustment ring coming loose.  If it's not long enough, the top locknut won't be able to secure to the threaded steerer.  In most cases, you'll want enough length to make a minimum of three complete turns of the top locknut.
