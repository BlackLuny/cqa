20090203095856AAvemUA	Family & Relationships;Family	Am i being abused? or i am being over dramatic?	first of all u should know 2 things, 1- i am a 14 years old boy, 2- i live in a family of 2 girls and 5 boys.    i have always thought about my life, and why my life is not like other kids lives, for my personality, i wont say i am good or bad, u should judge for urself, i am a quite, smart, hardworking, loving person. in school, i get good grades, but i ALWAYS felt like a stranger, always other kids in my class were so ........childish, as u probably assume i am the lonely smart kid in the class with no friends, everyone thinks i am so ......tight on myself, after school most of kids in my class go to smoke or to chase girls around, i don't , i just go home and watch tv or chat with my friends online or play maple or anything, that's why i am considered the "geek" in the class(although i am good looking and i am not bragging about it believe me), enough about my personality, in my family i am the fixer,(fixer= the one that fixes everything around the house and if i couldn't i get blamed even if i didn't do it) my brothers r very cocky, they get new clothes once each month or 2, i always wear my brothers old or unneeded clothes but i dun nag my mom about it cuz i go shopping for clothes once or twice a year(which is maximum), when it comes to money if there is no school i get like half a dollar each week!!!!!!!! if there is school i get half a dollar a day(i know u will think that my family is poor but belive me with 4 cars and 2 beautiful homes we r not) so all the money and attention goes to my 4 brothers and 2 little sisters, my parants had 4 boys and then they had me, so my parants hated me when i was born, when i was 3 years old i was like thrown off life cuz my sister was born ALL the attention was poured like honey on her, she gets ANYTHING she wants, even if its grilled birds toungs(which doesnt exist but belive me my dad will find a way to make it happen for her) i LOVE going to resturants but i only go once a year and that would be at the end of the year(note: i pay the money i save up all year long for my dinner so no my parants doesnt take me to resturants unlike my brothers,my brothers r allowed to hit my as much as they want and how they want and my parants know it happens but they always say u deserve it, well that should give u a complete picture about my life so tell me am i being abused or overdramatic? and tell me what i should do to fix it, please if i dun get an answer soon this would be my last question (o ya i am gonna do it)

20090203100057AAnzv5X	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	My fiance turns into a totally different person over the phone?	My fiance recently moved in with one of his friends and we have been together for almost 10 months and it wasn't like this 2 months ago. When we get on the phone, he never has anything to say. i always have to find something to talk about and he expects me to start the conversation which is pretty hard to do because i always have to think about what im saying before i say it and ill explain why a little later. He is always multi tasking when we get on the phone, he is either downloading music or playing guitar hero or laughing with his friend and when i finally say something it seems like he just comments on whatever i had to say and gets back to what he was doing, so i feel ignored. He also uses a lot of sarcasm and he uses this tone that makes me feel like absolute crap or makes me feel like a just said the stupidest thing in the world when i finally say something and he answers me. but the ridiculous part is that when we are actually face to face he wants to be all loving and whatever. and a couple months ago, he was all loving on the phone and everytime we would get off the phone he would say i love you but now i get a occasional i love you or just a bye. but when i try to bring the issue into the light, he wants to tell me that i take everything too seriously, i need to get a grip, or i can't take a joke, but a couple months ago he wouldn't have NEVER IN HIS LIFE said anything crazy or taken any crazy tones of voice with me.....I don't know whats going on.....Help?

20090203100221AAQQBmm	Family & Relationships;Family	How to deal with strict muslim parents who won't let me do anything?	My parents are both muslim, and although we live in England, they won't let me do loads of things. If I go to the cinema with guy friends as well as female friends, my dad gets suspicious, I can't go to parties when my dad doesn't know if there's going to be alcohol there or not, I can't go to sleepovers unless it's at familys' houses, and worst of all, I can't have a boyfriend. I'm 16 and am serious about my studies; I work hard at school and get good grades, but my parents totally dismiss the idea of having a boyfriend. Also, my mum is totally against the idea of me ever moving out unless it's to live with my husband (Oh - and I'll have to pick him from a selected lisy my parents give me). My dad's less strict than my mum, and when I told my mum I can do what I want when I'm 18 and move out, she said "no not as a muslim girl". She drives me mad - what should I do?
20090203100348AAoTDqb	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Boy problems, the usual.?	There's this boy that i've liked for a while. I donno how i started to like him because i in fact used to hate him once. Just the way he treated girls made me mad, his eyes looking at them like they where butter of a hot pan sliding all over them. I didn't know that i would become one of those girls.    Last year in spring, i went over to his house. My parents and his parent are friends and so they had a bbq planned and i had to go. He was there, and since his brother had to study for exams, he was the only one to 'entertain' us. So me and my sister went up to his room and we where talking and listening to music and he was just so sweet to me. He spoke a lot and abt many things. It was like i knew so much abt him but yet so little.  That was the first day i started to like him.    We would take on msn all the time after that and i got to know him more. He was great to me, but i was 13 so it could've been too naive. Then we went on summer holiday and we didn't talk for 2 months since neither of us had access to msn. And then my parents told me that he was leaving the country where and moving to his home country. After that, i only saw him a couple of times when he came to visit his dad who is still living in the country. All he wanted to do was get into my pants tho because he told boys in my grade he had.    Anyways, getting to the point, I can't seem to get him out of my mind. When i try to start a new relationship, i just sneak out because i think i still like this other guy. From what i told u abt our history and wat type of guy he is,  is there any possibility that i have a chance with this guy? Or should i just move on and how? Thanksss :)       *Note: Some of you may think this is sad and pathetic, but if ur gonna write smthing like, "ur sad, get a life" u shouldn't comment at all. I'm just saying. I'm done here. thankyou :) *

20090203100835AAJ2hCn	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	One minute I like him, the next I don't?	I know this kind of behaviour is a bit selfish.      But, there's this guy who I was going out with then we broke up a couple of weeks later.      I thought I still had feelings for him [he did too] so we went out again. [About 2 months later]      We're not together now but when I see him I always have an urge to ask him out again, only if I do, I know I'll end up hurting him a bit more.       So basically, when I'm not with him, I want to be.   When I am, I don't.      What's wrong?      Thanks, please no stupid answers.

20090203100613AAbrRSL	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Getting tired of fiancés porn habit?	I'm 21.  My fiancé is 30 and we've been together for almost 3 years.  We've lived together for two years and have a 5 month old son together.        He's great in most ways... he cooks, he cleans, he even does laundry, but he's obsessed with porn.        Just before Christmas 07 I caught him looking at porn sites whilst I was talking to him from the next room.  I just popped my head round the door and he didn't close the screen in time.  I ignored it at the time but it hurt and the next day I confronted him saying do what you want when I'm out, but if you feel you need to look at porn whilst I'm in the next room it's not going to work out.      He apologised and promised never to look at porn again (I didn't really believe he could stop like that... but I hoped at least he'd save it for when I was out!!!)  The next day we found out I was pregnant after trying for months.        When I was 35 weeks pregnant and using computer, I saw in History that he actually had a profile on alt.com and was looking for "discreet friends".  It was all filled in in great detail AND even though you could join for free, he'd paid extra for the best membership with most benefits.  I was hormonal and very pregnant and wasn't sure what to do... I didn't feel I could think straight.  A couple of days later I tried to bring it up with him and I ended up screaming "You've ruined everything!" ran downstairs and cried hysterically in the bathroom.  I was in such a state I really scared him... mostly down to hormones but he really did look terrified!      When I calmed down I said to him "Porn is one thing, but looking for other women is another."  He said he had no idea what he meant and that I should show him.  I went to the computer, but he'd deleted the history.  I ended up joining the site (in front of him... I mean, he watched me fill out the form!) so I could look up his user name.  I found his profile and he tried to turn it around on me saying I had a profile, despite watching me join 10 seconds ago!!!  He denied it was his and I read out his date of birth, location, hobbies, age etc etc and languages spoken: English, German, French, Japanese (only him) and he denied it and shrugged for what seemed like forever.  Eventually after I read the languages he said "OK, so it's mine.  What do you want me to do?"  I was crying by then saying we have a baby due in 5 weeks - what do I do now?  I asked him to delete it, which he did.  He apologised and he cried to (I never saw him cry before)... I think my mistake at this point was after seeing him cry, forgiving him instantly and even having make up sex!        Anyway - now we have our son and he's at it again.  I caught a glimpse of porn on his screen again when he didn't close quick enough and checked his email later (he told me the password himself months ago as our landlady contacts us both on his) and he's subscribed to a porn site and is downloading stuff at times when I'm looking after the baby downstairs, having a bath, watching TV... whenever I'm not in the room basically, never mind just in the house.        I'm just getting really tired of it.  I'm passed caring what he does when I'm out with our son... that's his time, he can have it.   But why why WHY does it have to carry on when I'm home?  Why can't he actually spend time with us?  I don't feel angry or hurt this time... just tired of it.  I feel like after the last couple of big blow ups over it that I don't have the energy to talk to him again.  I know he'd do anything for me and baby... he's attentive, loving... but I feel like the porn thing is a great big shadow over everything.  What do I do now?

20090203101015AAyyUvN	Family & Relationships;Friends	Does he like me or is he just being a friend?	ok so one of my boyfriends friends that i have become pretty good friends with him to, has just got out of his marriage.  But even before this, he was always looking at me, and stuff.  He kinda lets me do whatever when im at his house.  He gives up his chair for me, gives me cigarettes, whatever.  And now i was just talking to him about his now ex wife, which is also a good friend of mine, and is said at least ur still talking to me.  And he's always calling me girl.  I catch him looking at me sometimes 2.  I don't know, i love my boyfriend more than anything, and i love his ex-wife, shes my best friend, but i also get lil butterflies when hes around.  What do u think?
20090203101437AA7GyPu	Family & Relationships;Friends	What to do? I feel like I'm stuck in the middle..?	OK here is the issue. I have a friend named Sara who knows me since i was a little girl. she is 33 & i am 21. she used to be with my uncle. my uncle was horrible to her. he emotionally abused her & probably physcial behind closed doors. she finally got out of that 10 year horrible relationship & found herself a good man that she now has 2 kids by which i'm very happy for her.   the problem is she is getting married to this guy she's been with for a couple years now & she has asked me to be her maid of honor to her very small, personal & intimate wedding. i immediately said yes. but now i find out my boyfriend of 10 months may not be invited.    me & my boyfriend have hung out w/sara & her fiance on numerous occasions. we've even spent numerous weekends at thier house & all just hang out. we all get along & we all seem to have things in common with eachother. i have no question that they dont like him but i take it very personal that they wouldnt invite him.   sara told me that they are limited to their seating [they are having the wedding at her house]. i find that very disrespectful & mean to not want him to go. if they invite me they should expect my partner/thier new friend right? my boyfriend takes it personally as well & says he doesnt think i should go if they dont allow him to go because he'd do the same had he been in my position. they say he's def invited to the reception which is a month later. i feel i'm stuck in the middle & dont know what to do. i'm so happy for her & wANt to be my maid of honor but will feel horrible w/out going w/my boyfriend even if he HADNT had an issue w/it. she said she'll look to see if they could make room for him & let me know. i'm hoping that they do have room for him. he wont even mind if he has to stand the entire time. but if they dont...i have no idea what i should do. pass on the maid of honor request or just go w/out my man. i love them both very much & dont want anyones feelings hurt. what would you do?       now this may ruin the relationship w/us as well because now my bf may not want to ever hang out w/them anymore because he feels out of place & like an outsider.

20090203101220AANpWEb	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Sexual question...looking for guys to answer!?	Ok basically here is my issue. When my husband was home we had sex alot but only when he wanted to. There would be times he would be laying on my bed and he would be just all fine and dandy and I had just gotten out of the shower. At one point in time I walked over to the bed, dropped my towel, got on top of him and started making out with him while moving my hips around and pressing myself against his crotchal region. I did this for like three minutes and then I sat up. He asked me to move because he couldn't see the TV. He didn't have a bon-er or anything. No reaction whatsoever. This happened quite a few times. And usually when we had sex it was fast and done with in like two minutes. I could never give him a bon-er. I even went down on him a few times and nothing happened. When I asked him why I couldn't give him a bon-er he got all pissy with me. But when he wanted to have sex he got one just fine. So heres my question...WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON??? Do I not turn him on? Is he grossed out by me? HELP!

At the moment i am half way in between two groups of friends but one group hate everyone in the other group so i cant combine them, so Group A hate Group B.  If i am with Group A i feel like they dont really want me there and its all a bit awkward, they always insult Group B and it takes all my self control not to just scream.  I love being with Group B but i also have good friends in Group A and the more time i spend with Group B the more reasons Group A find to say horrid things about me.  But because of this, i am drifting away from all my friends in Group A and soon it will be too late for me to still be friends with them cos i feel like they hate me being around them.  I just dont know what to do anymore. I would be so grateful for any advice.
20090219182256AA3VubI	Family & Relationships;Family	Problems with parents. Help?	Hey. Okay, so my parent have been married for over 15 years (This is both of their 2nd marriages) but have started fighting a lot lately. It is mostly about the smallest things but escalate into huge fights and somehow involve some random comment I make or something I did (ex. I forgot to walk the dog, or-I say I didn't leave the milk out all day because I haven't had milk today-and I'm telling the truth, but the one that actually did the wrong thing doesn't believe me). So my questions are: Is this "normal" fighting? What can I do to make it stop? And is it my fault or should I stop feeling so guilty? Thanks everyone.

20090219181248AAZckPA	Family & Relationships;Family	What do I do about my relatives?	Well, ok, it's not about them but about me interacting with them. For the most part I am a quiet person and won't talk unless someone starts the conversation (but this is only with certain family members).      I have relatives on my dad's side (uncle, aunty, cousin, and another aunty) which my dad just adores. We're having dinner with them tomorrow and I can remember the last time this happened: I didn't talk much and just listened. It was partly because my cousin (who's younger than me), wasn't there for me to talk to. (By the way I'm 20). With her I'll gladly start a conversation and try to keep it going but she's more quiet then me around family!      I don't want this to be awkward for me, so what do I do in terms of talking? And if my cousin's not there...then what?

I felt that I needed to apologize for the way I acted during the beginning of the school year and just catch up since we haven't talked in so long. So I called her up and told her that I wanted to meet up with her so we could talk about it and from what it seemed like she also wanted to talk as well but for some reason I'm not so sure if she's just saying that not to be rude or if she really meant it. She started saying hi to me again in school which you would think is a sign that she wants to talk but I'm having doubts. What do you think?

The reason why I added the note is because i tried looking up turn-ons and turn-offs for guys, but they were for MEN, not teenage guys. i'm a 14-year-old girl and i don't want to do stupid things in front of a guy I like. I don't want to do something that I guy wouldn't like and I want to do something that a guy WOULD like. So, what turns a guy on or off?

20090219181937AAz94Uv	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	My Friend Is Breast Feeding?	This is a bit strange and I don't really know where to post this...      I'm living with my girlfriend who just had a baby a couple month's ago, and she is breast feeding.  The father isn't really in the picture and I help out some while she goes to class, but that's really neither here nor there.      I've made out with a couple other girls in my life but I wouldn't call myself a lesbian.  Nothing past kissing at all and I wouldn't say I'm attracted to my friend.      However.  Her baby wasn't eating the way he should for a day or two days.  Nothing big.  He's fine now, it's all good, but during that time she complained about her boobs getting sore and she says it takes way too long to pump it out.      So she said, kinda joking that she needed someone to suck out the milk and somehow I said I wanted to see what it tasted like, and yadda, yadda, yadda, she whipped out a boob and I gave it a shot, and apparently it did relieve the soreness.      This has actually happened twice now, but it gets more wierd.      First, I do like it.  I'm not sure why. I wasn't breast fed as a baby but I really enjoy it.  So I guess my first question is, how screewed up is this?      Now, the second time this happened, I'm not sure what prompted the suggestion, but my friend says to me, 'If you want to masturbate while you suck them, I don't mind.'      I don't know what spawned this, and I certainly didn't.  I think I said 'It's ok, I'm good."  But here is the rub, now that it has been brought up, I've become kind of obsessed with the idea.      WTH, right?  Am I a freak?!?!?  Should I move out and away from this?  Is it ok?  I'm so messed up.

My younger 14 year old sister has a special relationship with our 68 year old aunt who lives with us and helped my parents raised my sister since she was 5. Our aunt is like a motherly figure to us and my sister considers her as her best friend. Sadly, my sister felt comfortable enough to tell our two cousins that & they laughed at her which hurt her feelings. I think that it's great that she sees our aunt as friend but many believe that that's abnormal.

20090219181104AAPAXYR	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How can I show my wife I've changed?	My wife and I have been separated for nearly a year. It has just about killed me, for I love my wife dearly. Since she left, we both have gone to counseling. She lives in a different state with our two children together, and has a daughter from a previous marriage that I've known for years. She left in part because the relationship between her daughter and I had become more than strained. When her daughter visited her dad last year and said she wasn't coming home, I grew angry, and took it out on my wife, and to a lesser extent, my children. Now, after a year of being apart, I have tried very hard to be loving toward my wife and children. I was wrong, dead wrong about my attitudes. I never stopped loving my wife and children, but she is focusing on my past behavior (which I don't excuse or forget) rather than the potential of the present and future. I want to take full responsibility for what I've done and show her and the children that I have nothing in my heart for them but love. My wife says she doesn't love me because of the past. She's had ample time to file for divorce, yet has not. I miss my wife and children terribly, and want nothing more than to show them I love them. I've tried to show her that I feel different and that I am different, but she's not convinced -- and she says there's nothing that can be done to fix it. There's nothing in my life I want to do more than to show them love, compassion and contrition. But how?

20090219185904AA5H2AO	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Ladies, Valentine's Poem?	Okay, so I understand that Valentine's day has already passed... However, being that my girlfriend was away during the weekend, we decided that we would celebrate it tomorrow. I had decided on the routine flowers/card/dinner, but I wanted to add something unique of my own; so I wrote her a poem.      It's nothing really special, being that I'm not a poet; I just wanted to get the message across because I love this girl to death. I wanted to get some feedback from others though, so be harsh, be cruel, be what you want. ^-^      From the first moment I met you, I knew you were different.   You were kind, caring, and completely magnificent.   You make me laugh and fill me with glee;   In these past seven months, you have brought out the best in me.   When we’re together, I feel so complete,   And when we touch my heart starts to beat.   I can only hope that you feel the same way too,   Because my love for you is so true.   Now I ask from you my love, that you be mine,   That you will be my Valentine.      I am reposting this again because I wanted more feedback.

I had $100.00 that I'd gotten for my birthday.   While shopping kayla told me she "forgot" her wallet at home, and asked if I could lend her $25.00       I don't lend out money to friends, like ever. But I've known kayla for over 3 years, and we're pretty close. Anyways, So I did end up lending her the money.      She told me that her mom was giving her money soon and that in 2 days she would pay me back. Well it's been over two weeks. I tried asking her for the money a couple of times, but she said she "just didn't have the money" and that her mom hadn't gave her any money.      Fair enough, right? Well, today she was bragging about how her mom is taking her on an expensive cruise. She also showed me a new top she got. So much for not having money!      I know it's only twenty five bucks, but this was my 17th birthday money, I don't have a job, and my mom doesn't like ever give me money.       WHAT DO I DOOOOOOOOO

I called her later that day to see what she was up to. She said she would after she had dinner with her friends.       She never called back, last night.

I have an underwear and swimsuit modeling shoot coming up.  I have told my girlfriend I have a shoot.. but haven't told her what kind.  I feel bad doing this type of shoot, because I feel like I am violating our relationship. If the situation were flipped I know for sure I wouldn't want HER modeling in underwear.  The gig is for $400 and I NEED the money.. but I don't think I would feel too happy with myself afterwards.. how can I approach this with her and try to make her understand... I don't know what to do. =(
20090219182716AALidPm	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why is he(my boyfriend) so complicated?	me and my boyfriend were talking on the phone and then later it just got quiet so he asked me if i wanted him to call back later cause there was nothing to talk about and then i said i didn't want to cause i thought we would eventually come up with something to talk about. so then a little bit later i said you can call me back later if you  want because things didn't change the conversation was still quiet and he said whatever and hung up in my face. then another issue is him always putting his self down and i always say things to try to lift him up but he takes what i say and turns it around to something bad that makes me feel like crap....what should i do? and by the way im sorry to pour out my issues like this but i have no one else who cares or wants to listen. they have their on problems.

20090219183525AADf7YD	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Do men REALLY wish that their wife, fiance, or girlfriend were more attractive?	This is a debate I am currently having:      I accused a friend of being shallow for saying that he wishes his wife of 3 years (they have dated 4 years prior to getting married) would work out more and lose some weight.       He said this TO HER. And then she got upset and came crying to me about it, wondering why he couldn't love her for WHO she is (which he does) and think she's  the most beautiful woman in the room because he loves her so much (they do love each other very much and he treats her well in other respects).       She has always considered herself and 8, so it isn't like she's fat or ugly, but she does have a "pooch" and she was dumb enough to ask what he rated her and learned that it was a 7.      He claims that he really isn't that shallow (though he shouldn't have admitted it aloud, he says) because all men secretly wish that their significant others would be more attractive.      Is he an ******, or just stupid for saying aloud what everyone else is thinking?

I have a boyfriend, we may get married down the line, as we have been dating for a year now.  So, my life sounds good right?  Well, I'm 26 and have no idea what I am supposed to do with my life that makes me happy, yet pays the bills.      I am lucky enough to have supportive parents who would help me in anything I decide, the problem is that I have not been able to make this decision.      I am in the process of starting my own business, which is great when you say to someone, "hey I run a business", but not great when you are unsure if this is even what you want for yourself.      My business is in video production, which is what I know.   However, I love making things, like working with my hands and using tools and getting dirty.  I do a huge display outside my house for Halloween and everything is homemade.      I ran into some people tonight who I have not seen in years and years, old friends, and they are all successful bankers and lawyers now.  I'm a bum who sits in my pj's all day wondering where my life went!      Obviously Yahoo! answers is nothing more then person opinions from people who may or may not be knowledgeable and I know that I should seek advice from someone not on the Internet, but surely one of you must have some useful piece of wisdom for me!

There is a kid who keeps picking on him and recently he got hit in the face pretty hard to him. He had very red eyes they looked as if it was like blood gushing... I mean...

20090219185720AAHhuLS	Family & Relationships;Family	Can Human Services help me?	Long story short: I'm a single mom of a 7 yr.old. I don't have a drivers liscense or own a car. I dont have a job. I'm currently living w/my parents who can't afford to support me & my child. While stayin here I have taken on responsibilty of takeing care of mom who is on dialisis treatments twice a day. I dont have any friends or family members willing to drive me to and from a job if I were to find one & I live too far out in the country to be able to walk to town. Human Services/Welfare won't give me food stamps or ADC unless I have a mim. of a 20 hr work week or unless I work 40 hrs. a wk for them because my child is over the age of 6 yrs. old. By doin that I would need transpertation to & from location which as I said I dont have. My childs father also refuses to pay support. I could get an apt. at a rental assised place and sign up for the check that pays your electric bill for you each month and have little to no rent to pay just to get started and out of parents home & once out in an apt. look for work in that area that I could then walk to. However without first having a job how do I get food? I have an offer to move out of state by a friend who is offering to help me get my life straight and get my liscense a car and a job an place of my own. But thats if I agree to move to her state an stay with her temp. so she can help me out. My mom is very sick with 1 kidney failed & the other failing I am very close to her and my older bro. and my neices & its hard for me to agree to leave them all behind to take my friend up on this offer. Not to mention the threat of my ex saying he will try to take custody of our child away from me if I move out of state. I dont know what to do or how to go about doing it my family wont help me. I need to get my life straight and get out on my own. Any advice????
20090219185807AAlEf73	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	When do court orders begin?	I'm going through a divorce and the Judge gave my husband until the 24th of Feb to move out of our house.  He plans to move into his own place this weekend so I would think that once he does that, all of the stipulations the Judge set forth would begin to apply since he has moved.  One stipulation is that once he moves, he cannot come onto this property or the house without my permission or me being present but my husband keeps insisting that even if he moves out now, he can still come and go from this house until the 24th.  Is he right??  My attorney is at her mom's funeral so I highly doubt I will hear back from her in time!  THANKS!!

20090219213633AAzStLH	Family & Relationships;Family	My brother is suicidal, so he chooses to be a perfectionist because he got nothing else good?	MY BROTHER HAS GONE MAD!      He wants to surpass everyone in anything in this world! What I meant by that is he will do anything to be better than anyone!       He gets jealous around people when he sees that they did something really good.       I found this in his letter last month ago and it says "In the past people mistreated me and treated me like a lowlife garbage, so then I'll show them what im really capable off and from now and on before I die I will be the best and the perfect one. I dont even care anymore even if it means hurting someone. I just want to be the greatest since i got nothing else good left in this world because people in this world ruined me and destroyed my talents. I will prove myself that i am far better than this ignorant fcktards and I will prove to myself that i still have something inside me. I am a real warrior not them! I have the higher call! i will show them and prove to myself that i can beat anyone in this dead world!" (The letter is very long i dont wanna type it all in here)       So then, last 3 days ago, he got into a fight with another student in his school and he said that he started the fight and knock the kid out because he wants to show them and prove to himself that he is better than anyone else before he dies. He got temporarly suspended after that incident.       The next day after that, my brother played his PS3 console non stop to achieve the highest score in this online game, I dont want to stop him because he might get angry and when he's angry he goes berserk... so i just let him play until he got hungry and eventually stopped at 9:32 PM evening.       Today, early this morning, he is writing some poem or poetry (I think) and doing some drawings, hes been doing this for almost 3 hours now and he hasnt eaten his early breakfast yet, he hasnt even taken a bath yet for 1 day...       This has been going on for a quiet a long time and is getting worse everyday, weve been to psychologists, therapists and psychaitrists but nothing helped!       im scared and worried about my brother that he might hurt himself or someone, pls any experts out there help me. My brother has gone mad, and he is depressed, suicidal and suffering from several personality disorder and some mental disorders (He is 17 Btw and im 19)        I dont know what to do anymore...
20090424064325AAFvbcz	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Have you not noticed this ?	Today parents are enrolling their children to learn Martial Arts and other arts of self-defence with the intention that their children will learn to defend themselves. But, they seem to be missing out on this important point and that is ANGER CONTROL. Children should be taught to control their anger before lashing out on anyone they find irritating. A person who learns to control his or her anger is able to forgive and pardon people for small small issues. But when this untrained children grow up into Adults, they use their skills to bash a thief who could have been hungry for days and he could be stealing something for the first time. Is it not the Responsibility of Adults to teach their children to be soft hearted and a good human being ? We often see Youngsters engaged in Street Fights primarily because they as children were only trained to use their hands and legs to break someone's face and no attention was paid to teaching them Perseverence and Anger Control.      Dear Youngsters, what are your opinions on this ?

20090219195725AAgB1mv	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What to do if ex wont let you see your child even though youre paying child support?	my boyfriend has a child with his ex and he pays his child support every week and every weekend hes supposed to have his daughter something always comes up with the ex. she will wait till last minute (literally while hes on his way to pick her up) to tell him he cant have her that weekend or she will just dodge his calls. well he hasnt had her since the first week of december and hes supposed to have her every other weekend. he was supposed to get her this weekend and we had all this stuff planned to do with her and she calls him today saying he cant have her because she has a dentist appt she just cant miss. i mean that may be true but with her history i doubt it. i know its not because of me, at least i dont think, because as far as i know from him and his family she has been doing this to him ever since they split. basically i wanna know what hes supposed to do about it because hes taking it as hes a bad father when really its her doing it not his daughter sitting at home saying she doesnt wanna come here. we make it very fun for her when shes here and always do lots of stuff so i know its not her saying that and hes paying his support and also buys her everything she needs when he does have her. i know in their divorce papers there was a form about holidays and scheduled times to call and his weekend visitation, ive read it he left it laying around and i was curious, so im assuming shes not allowed to be doing those things since it was written in their final divorce papers his visitation and call times but i dont have kids and dont know much about the issue so any ideas on what he should do?
20090219195429AADhSZX	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Is love fundamental to human existence?	I'm 21 and never been in a relationship, nor desire to be in one. I'm probably asexual. I think society puts way too much emphasis on relationships and finding that special someone. Why can't people just be happy with themselves? People think that being in a relationship will automatically make them happy and solve all their problems. Why is there obsessive interest over relationships?   I'm not really that close to anyone. I only have one or two friends. It's hard for me to get close to people in general...kind of because I don't see why people would want to hang out with me. So I guess in some ways, I have low-self esteem. I don't think I've ever emotionally opened up to another human being..   My question is, am I missing out on what life is all about?

20090219191819AALUQ9o	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Can I be accused of medical neglect?	My ex wants our son - 13 years old - to get braces. We had a consult with an orthodontist who stated that they were not medically necessary. My son still has two baby canines and one is impacted. There are a lot of details about it, we could wait and see if they come in naturally, leave them like they are, or we could have them pulled and see if the adult teeth come in on their own, OR have them pulled and have 2 and a half years of braces and very complicated procedures to force the teeth into alignment.  I am against the braces because I think they are trying to sell us vanity for several thousand dollars. If I refuse to go along with the braces, can I be charged with medical neglect?   Thanks for helping.
20090219213143AA1Z1At	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What do you do when you don't like any of the women who like you nor what turns them on about you?	I hate how I look. I'm 6'3", broad shouldered, and started losing my hair at 17, so I'm forced to shave it now, so I look like some meathead soldier or cop or something. I don't care if some guys would wish they were bigger...and hearing that some girls actually like big bald guys makes me feel worse. That may be difficult to understand...think of it this way: some guys find fat girls totally sexy, but that doesn't mean a fat girl will appreciate the fact that a guy notices her extra pounds. It's the same way with me....I'm not so desperate for acceptance that any girl who tells me "I love a big man" will make me change my thinking (though I joke that Kate Winslet or Anne Hathaway could make me reconsider it).      I've never attracted a single girl I liked, and I gave most of them a chance just to make sure I wasn't making snap judgments. Just as I predicted, they were needy, desperate, and looking for a father figure. Creepily enough, all of them wanted to be dominated sexually: if I held them down by their wrists and overpowered them, they were in ecstasy and I hated myself even more. This seems to be standard among many women...what was creepy was how many of them told me (in bed) that I reminded them of their father.      I can lose weight, but I can't get my hair back nor can I change my general stature. I hate it, but I can't do anything about it. I don't know how to get over it. I did virtually everything save get a toupee: I did Rogaine and Propecia, I had hair transplants done by the best surgeon in Beverly Hills (on Rodeo Drive, no less).      Oh, and please don't tell me to "learn to love yourself the way you are" or assure me that "some girl will come along who loves you for your inner beauty". Also, don't tell me that "the right girl" won't care how I look...we all care about appearances. Those who claim not to care are either those trying to avoid seeming shallow or those who cannot afford to be choosy.

20090219210939AAG3WW7	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Am I over-reacting or being selfish?	My fiance and I are getting married in 6 weeks.  We have been saving like crazy, but last month he lost his job, and then spent his share of savings on overseas trip to see his family and his mum who was sick in hospital.  He's back now, and looking for another job.  I personally have already paid for my wedding dress and his outfit, and our return airfares for honeymoon, and airfares for some of his family to come to for our wedding. We have rebudgeted and severely downgraded our wedding plans to cut costs, but our budget shows we can barely even afford that now.  Now he tells me he is behind in child support payments to his ex, and any money he saves between now and wedding, will go to his ex anyway.    Im feeling very down and disillusioned that I will have to pay for the entire wedding, including my own wedding ring, and in the heat of the moment, I told him so.  He responded with "you know I have kids, sorry for troubling you with that" and "you shouldnt have wasted the money to pay for the airfares for my family" (even though he was right there when i booked them online and wanted me to do that).  I'm normally a very generous person, always going the extra mile for other people.   I'm not sure what to think anymore.   Am I being selfish and over-reacting in this situation?
20090219201738AA8GS7b	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	A question about a person you would marry?	Wasn't sure how to title this question.      But me and my boyfriend have just broke up and I have been asking myself certain questions the last few days.      (we didn't break up for this reason, its simply a thought)      Some people will never find 'the love of their life' and I may be one of them. I want kids when I am older but I do worry I won't find the man I am looking for. My boyfriend and I have split up more or less because we are not 'the one' for each other, although we are good friends and I do love him very very much, just not really enough to marry. But I was thinking the other day, if neither of us found our 'true love' in 5 years time, I would be quiet happy to settle down with him and have kids. He would be a wonderful father and I know he would look after us all, we would be just missing that special 'click' although having kids together would help I suppose.      I am not asking should I do it or not, I'm still very younge (23) and there is plenty more fish in the sea. I am just asking as a general question, if people have or would do it, for me surly it is better to have a 'special/good' friend as a partner and father/mother or your child, than no one at all?! That is my personal belief any way.... whats yours?

20090219190926AArLmDE	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	ONLY  MEN!What compels a man to want to risk a good thing?	i know you guys arent detailed beings but for your answers plz go into example, details reasons.      i had  previous question posted. Its clearly obvious that sex drives a man to cheat on his wife, and after some regret.       Are u men just coldheartless creatures? do you guys not know that women also made a choice, to not ruin a good thing.      tell me what goes on in those feeble minds of yours? haha      this question really is mind-blowing for me. There is a guy who comes to my work, flirts, wants to take me out, and its sad to say...but nowadays, if women dont cyberstalk a guy, they wont find out anything about him. So anyways, my friend and i decided to cyberstalk him. OK OK I KNOW IM CRAZY. but he's HAPPILY MARRIED, has a child, and i also heard his wife or gf whatever...are incredibly happy together. BUT WHAT COMPELS A MAN TO JUST RISK LOSING HER? i truely feel sorry for his gf/wife. and it makes me realize..dont ever get married. dont ever take a guy seriously.       yea yea yea..i know men wanna test drive. but god. get a heart!

20090219190939AA9KmR8	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	After a divorce or break up with children...?	...should the access parent ask for the access that they want with the children or wait for the primary parent to offer extra time?      My ex is saying he wanted more than every second weekend for the past three years (he has never asked for extra time and he said he didn't know he could have extra time), he said he didn't know the kids had time off school at Christmas holidays etc...(I thought everyone knew kids had time off school).  He says I should have been offering him more time, I think he is just trying to play the 'ignorance' card and just couldn't be bothered getting more time.  He has gotten all time he has ever asked for, and I had to encourage visitation with him in the very beginning.

20090219190407AAmSD3W	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I REALLY like this guy, but don't want to be in a relationship..?	I'm 17 and never really have been one for committment for whatever reason. I just don't like the labels I guess. Anyways, this guy who was previously my friend told me that he liked me a lot, and we had a lot in common so we hung out quite a bit. Naturally that progressed... things happened, and I made it clear that I didn't necessarily want a relationship and he understood. We've been hanging out for over a month now and just said at one point, not necessarily right away, that he'd like to call me his girlfriend. I really like this guy a lot, he does anything for me and is so sweet, but I still don't know about a relationship. I don't really want to lose what we have but I don't know if I want a committment either kinda thing. What can I do?

For the final test, the FBI agents took one of the men to a large metal       door and handed him a gun.

All was  quiet for about 5           minutes.

Finally, it was the woman's turn. She was given the same instructions, to     kill her husband.                                                                                                                                            She took the gun and went into the room. Shots were heard, one after         another.  They heard screaming, crashing,  banging on the walls. After a     few minutes, all was quiet.

'This gun is loaded with blanks' she said.  'I had to beat him to death       with the damn chair.'

20090219202714AABuqGv	Family & Relationships;Weddings	How many metres of fabric for one dress?	We are getting married in a year from now and I just have a Q regarding bridesmaid dresses. We are on a tight budget (arent we all in these stressful economic times). Instead of buying my bridesmaids their dresses, i was thinking about just buying the fabric for them. Seeing the fact that they have all different body shapes, this means that my mum and my sister in law could sew the dresses for free (the girls could then have the dress made in the design they like according to their body types) but they would still fit in the 'theme colour' of our wedding. How much fabric do i need to purchase per dress if it were a floor length dress, and also, what is the best type of fabric to use for this. I was thinking about 6 - 7 metres or so. And where in Australia could i purchase fabric like this for about $10 - $12 per metre (because that is approximately the budget we had in mind - or would this be impossible).      thanks for your help

My baby's father lives in New York so I haven't seen him since I left New York.  I screwed up and slept with a married man.  His wife knows that him and I had sex.  He told her it was a one time thing when in reality it went on for months.  He won't tell anyone the truth about what happened between us and I'm fed up with it.  I feel like I should still be talking with him to let him know how I'm doing and how the pregnancy is going but at the same time, he makes me so mad when I talk to him.  I'm at the point where I want to tell his wife that he's been lying to her for 8 months.  Should I continue to talk to him everyday like I have or should I only let him know how my doctors appointments go?  Should I stop talking to him all together?  I want him involved in my child's life but not if he's going to continue to lie about what happened between us. PLEASE HELP!

First she phoned me to let me know about the affair, my husband had been trying to stop it but I later found out they had still been talking a few times a week after I found out.  I then fouond a text message from her to him and told her husband.  Her husband after questioning her phoned me to inform me that they still were talking.

20090219193249AAvqLpS	Family & Relationships;Family	Is this or is this not a parent's responsibility?	I'm a 14 year old girl in the 9th grade. I like to think of myself as a very responsible and mature person, because I am. I'm in the International Baccalaureate Diploma Program at my high school. That is the hardest diploma in the world to get. I was on swim team this fall, ski club right now(winter)and am joining softball in the spring. In addition, I am in a Drum Corps. Also, I'm in the class of 2012 club and am joining spanish club next year. That is all by choice, because I want to be a success as an adult, and I want to go to Stanford University.      I obviously can't pay for all of this just by babysitting a couple of times a month, and when I asked my parents if they could pay for some of my activities, THEY SAID IT WASN'T THEIR RESPONSIBILITY. And when I said it would help me get into a good college, that is "NOT THEIR PROBLEM". How is that not their problem? I would assume that's a parent's responsibility, yet they think I need to get a job and pay for these things myself.      Ok, several problems with this:    ~i live in a lower middle class neighborhood, nobody can afford a babysitter. everybody does their yard work themselves, and my parents don't want me on a paper route because if somebody didn't pay for their newspaper, apparently my parents would have to pay for it.   ~And any other job nearby requires you to be 15.   ~Even when I turn 15 I'm going to have restrictions for not working after 7:00pm, softball practice won't get over until 6:30.      I WANT TO BE A HUGE SUCCESS AND MY PARENT'S DON'T CARE JUST BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T GO TO COLLEGE NOR FINISH HIGH SCHOOL. I'M NOT GHETTO LIKE THEM. I SOMEHOW MANAGE TO HANG WITH THE PREPPY KIDS, AND WITH MY PARENTS, I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH LONGER I CAN BE THIS SUCCESSFULL. I'M ON MY BREAKING POINT, WHICH IS SAD BECAUSE LIKE I'VE ALREADY STATED, I'M SMART, RESPONSIBLE, AND VERYVERYVERYVERYVERYVERYVERYVERY MATURE FOR MY AGE.      AND ONE MORE THING, I would love to get a job but I'm too young.      Most of my friends' parents REFUSE to let them have jobs because they would rather have them focusing on activities like me.      AM I LIKE TOTALLY MORE MATURE THAN MY PARENTS?????????????????????????????????...      Thank you for your time, and I look forward to your responses.

20090219201945AAZlXhZ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My ex boyfriend has bipolar, what should i do?	I started dating a great guy, we never had any disagreements or anything, and we would talk for hours upon hours every day. Suddenly we were talking less and less, maybe once a day for 5 minutes, however we would hang out more. Now we are to the point where he broke up with me because of something that happened before we got together, he is a very jealous person and hates for me to have any guy friends what so ever. I love him more than anything, I’d die for him if I had too, however, and he broke up with me and said that he needs to “find himself” but he promises that we will get back together because our love is strong and pure. He has many mood swings, he can’t sit down and talk when we argue he must leave and he is gone for hours and sometimes days; he is clinically diagnosed with bipolar disorder and ADHD. He has never tried hitting me or anything in that sort, however, he just tends to blow up over anything and it bothers me because I love him so. We are still broken up but he contacts me one day to tell me that he loves me and misses me and then the next day he is telling me to get out of his life. I don’t understand why, I don’t know if it is him or his bipolar disorder. We were just together over the weekend, we spent the weekend together and shared intimate moments together, we separated and I have now tried to contact him and I haven’t heard anything. He told me that he loved me before we departed and that he’d talk to me later, my friends tell me to run while getting is good because we are up and down like a roller coaster, but I can’t give up on him like this, to me, our love is the real thing and I want him to be more than a boyfriend. I love him. So, is it that he doesn’t want to be with me or is it the bipolar disorder?       Also, he always talks to his ex girlfriend, no matter if I’m sitting in the room or not, he is always texting her and they will talk pretty much the whole entire day. He swears that he loves me, she knows about me, and that he would never take her back, but why keeps talking to her. I know she was his first everything and they were together for years upon years, but they have been broken up now for awhile so why not be happy with me? I feel like I will never compare to her, like she will always be better than me. Maybe that is part of the disorder or maybe he just can’t let something that meant so much to him go?
20090219202249AAlEjK2	Family & Relationships;Family	I can't live with my parents!!!?	When I think about my relationship with my mom, it completely confuses me. When I talk to her it seems like she always kind of brings my mood down... though it's unintentional, and she really isn't that interesting to talk to. She likes to gossip, which isn't really my thing, and I just can't have an intellectual conversation with her, which is something I really want. I feel like I can't really relate to her... she has brought my family through some really rough times with my dad (whose no longer in my life), and now we live with my step-dad who is a whole other story. I really don't get along with him, and I've basically just accepted that I have to live with him, and the relationship is usually fine, but nothing more than that. And I really believe it can't be. I'm just really confused about the relationship with my family, and I hope it will get better eventually, though that seems very far away. If someone can give me some insight, or relate to what I'm going through, I would really appreciate hearing about it.
20090219202537AAxRNpS	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does he still like me?	Well, I met this boy, Kevin last weekend and we've been hanging out almost everyday. We kiss and hold hands all the time, except for today.  He was under the influence(weed) all day practically today and when I drove out of my way to see him (a half hour away) he seemed like he didn't even want to bother with me.  Me and my friend met him and his friends at the mall and we barely spoke. Then they left and we were supposed to meet them a bit later at a hooka bar. Well I came and they were already there. He didn't even save me a seat. I had to sit next to some kid I barely knew and talked to him for a bit before I left out of anger. What the heck. After a while, I felt like I shoulda gone back to talk to him, but felt like it was no use considering he was high. Help please?

20090219212755AAwsmEf	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Marriage and pregnancy- need help?	I am 28 years old and my husband is 33 years old. We both met in university and got married 3 years ago. He has a good job and I am currently seeking jobs. The issue is that he is ready to have kids. His family is putting pressure on us to have kids constantly. I understand that we are not getting younger.  For the last 3 years to pull my way through...I took the first job that i got hired for and finally got laid off a few months back. I understand where he is coming from, wanting to have kids because we are not getting any younger. I am willing to get pregnant next year and have kids the year after for his sake mainly, but he wants kids next year. At the same time, I think I am afraid to have kids right away because of a few issues; He makes fun of me calling me fat( I am 5'3 and I weigh 127 lbs) and I worry how fat i will get in the future after kids., His parents and family are so overbearing and I am afraid that they will take control of our child if we have one(His family is that way and he cant say no to them often), and because we just bought a house last yr and I am jobless so i worry about our financial future, my husband makes me feel horrible at times( he doesnt show interest in intimacy with me... etc., and I feel i need to accomplish something solid for my self( at least a decent job for the degree that i got from university). and my husband has told me that if i am not willing to have kids, that he will find someone else...infact he says this infront of his family and it make me feel horrible. I dont want to lose him. I really do love him. and I know he cares for me deeply....can anyone help?

My husband, who works 6 days a week has been drifting..You see, he just opened up his own company and is all about it! I have supported him this whole time and not bitched about the hours or schedule. Now that he is successful I am kinda jealous because its all about his business. He spends his extra time that he gets with the girls, but not always with just me. We fight when I ask him to take off or come home early, because you know hes got a business to run. I am needy, I will admit, but how do I get my husband to take time away from his busy schedule, without bitching and being an unsupportive wife??? ( I am not working by the way)

20090219213049AAD9b2v	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Things were perfect, till I found out he cheated and lied about it.  Should I still plan on the wedding?	We met on the road...we both travelled for a living.  He swept me off my feet.  Last year he decided to quit the travelling business to start a "real life" off the road.  The travelling job was just a job to him but to me I had a GOAL to accomplish and I was only a couple months away from accomplishing it when he got off the road, after I had been working 13 years towards this goal.  He said that I should stay on the road to finish what it was I wanted to do and he would patiently wait for me.  I gave my word that I would come off the road as soon as I did what I had to do and he told me to take my time and would support me.  Turns out, while I was out there FINALLY doing what I had worked so hard to do he cheated on me.  I didn't know it though, thought he was just going through a rough time trying to adjust to a new life.  He was throwing tantrums every other day while I was living my dream, even gave me an ultimatum to cut it short or else... and I caved.  When I finally came home he asked if I had cheated on him.  I told him no which was the truth.  I asked him the same and he said no so I went forth giving everything I had to the relationship for the past 8 months.  Then I found out a couple weeks ago that when he said that he hadn't cheated on me he was lying.  Everything has been so great since I got off the road that its so hard to enforce the agreement that we made in the beginning of the relationship that "cheating is a dealbreaker".  I just don't know what to do.  Now that he has been found out he refuses to talk about it so I am left to deal with it all on my own shoulders while he waits quietly for me to "get over it and move forward".  The hardest part is that the "other woman" is the secretary of the company that we work for in  a town of 800 people so there is no real way to avoid her.  I just don't know if I can ever trust him so whole heartedly again and get past this without his talking about it.  Or even if I want to stay.  Is is worth it?
20090219213852AAOaLGi	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I need a bit of... romantic advice.?	ok, here's the deal. PLEASE TAKE THE TIME TO READ THROUGH THIS!      I'm a young teen, around 16, and I've never been too successful in my love life. However, that is unimportant. First and foremost, I believe that love is a very serious thing that shouldn't be taken lightly. In light of this, none of the girls that I know in real life seem to interest me enough. Recently i have started work on a collaborative project with a bunch of people and one of them is a girl.      This is my problem. I was talking to a group of people on skype and she was one of the people. I think of myself as a pretty good judge of character, and after talking with her for a solid 5 hours I feel like I know what her personality is like. Here is my list of problems.      1. Despite feeling that love is a serious thing, for some reason I'm really starting to like this girl, even though I haven't seen her face, and I frankly don't know too much about her.      2. She doesn't know much about me, and I'm sure that no matter how long I take to get to know her, she's gonna think I'm a stalker or something if I try asking her out.      3. Well, I can't really ask her out because she lives on the other side of the world, and that's really a problem in itself.      4. I want to know if other people think it's really creepy that I'm obsessing over this girl. Keep in mind that I'm not any kind of stalker, and that I mean no harm whatsoever.      Please answer honestly, this is turning into a real problem, and I really have no idea what I should do.      And lastly, a few requests for your answers.   - I invite constructive criticism   - I know I'm 16, but please don't use that as an answer. Something like "Well, you're a teenager, it's normal to be a little confused" is not going to help at all.   - Pleas, please respond with something even if you don't think you have a good enough answer. I'll take any advice I can get.   - thanks very much!

20090219214309AAN2ihA	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I need advice about a cheating girlfriend?	So i've been with this girl for 4.5 years.  For the past couple years i have been really uptight and afraid of having fun and partying.  She on the other hand was very partyish but had no sense of responsibility.  We have been smothering each other for the past few years.        6 months ago she tried to break it off saying we became more like friends.  I didn't want to accept it so i plead to her to try and regain some feelings.  We tried but nothing changed.  She ended up falling into the pit of casual sex because she was partying and clubbing without me.  She cheated on me several times while i was away.  We just broke up 2 weeks ago.       Since then we have been living seperate.  Now we are both telling the truth about things, i am dealing with my fears and have become more ambitious for fun and she has become more responsible and wants to stay away from the casual sex scene.      She has already admitted that it's ashame we both couldn't change before she cheated and she feels bad about what she did to me because she still cares for me.  I think we can have a genuine relationship now but i don't want it to be just because i miss her.      Should i talk to her and see if it can work again, should i wait a while to make sure we both have changed, or should i just let her go.  Whatever i decide, we will still be friends.

20090219214431AA7GmS8	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is it okay to date a shorter guy? (I'm 5'8.5, he is 5'4-5'5)?	I'm in highschool, and I really like this guy i've been friends with for a few months. I just found how he likes me, and I am so happy! The only problem is the height... I'm about 5'9 with shoes on, and he is only about 5'5 or so! So far by best friend thinks it is cute, but my sister is making me think about the height difference a bit. Would everyone just think it is awkward once we start dating?
20090219214636AAsYHQs	Family & Relationships;Family	Heartbroken and a single mom. Should I take the father to court? Would I win?	My boyfriend broke up with me a week ago and already has a new girlfriend. If that's not hard enough on me I'm 19 yrs old and have a 4 month old that is ours to take care of by myself. I do smoke ciggs but my house is smoke free!! I go outside. I live with my mom and I don't have a car or a job. I plan on getting a 4 hr a day job that will pay me about 150$ a week such is enough for a car and my babys stuff. Her father smokes too and maybe pot again. He doesn't have a job or plan on getting one nor a car and he also lives with his parents. His parents are alcoholic and pot/ crack users. There's 5 people who smoke and the do it in the house. I have made rules for when we visited his parents ( when we were together) which was no smoking inside ( they smoked upstairs) and no drinking around my baby. Also anyone who wanted to hold her had to be 100% sober. Her father never cared about the rules becuz it was his family. He handed her to his parents many times when they were wasted and he doesn't make sure moines smoking around her or surrounding rooms. One time I came out from the store to find that his gramma was smoking in the car while my baby was in it. She could have gotten out to smoke. His response was " I didn't know" he was aslo in the car but to busy on his mp3 to notice. So a couple days ago he kept asking to see her alone at that house without me. I told him no way. If I wasn't there to protect my daughter they would drink/ smoke around her and he wouldn't stop them he never stood up to them. They all smoke/ drink around his 1 yr old cuzin. Today we made plans to meet at the park so he could see her because it wasn't to cold out and he came back from getting her formula and said he couldn't meet us because he had to help his dad. I asked if it could wait and he said no but he's making plans for tomorrow to see her. He didn't even want to come in for a min to see her or asked how she was doing. He canceled on seeing his daughter for the first time in a week and cpl days so he could do what? Help his dad fix sone1 elses car. So obviously she's not top priority. And he threatens to take me to court for joint custody whenever I tell him he can't bring her in his environent without me. You can't threaten for joint custody when visiting ur child isn't more important than anything else. He also has no respect for me and neither does his family. I'm not trying to keep her from him I'm just trying to protect her from the danger he would put her in. I told him they can visit her here anytime but they refuse. It's 1240am and I'm still waiting for him to get online so we can make plans again. So u see I don't know if I should just bring it to court. He takes no responsability and she's not #1 in his life. Should I? And if I do, do I have a chance of winning sole custody with visitations for him. And could I do it without a lawyer? Or if I need one a court approove lawyer and legal gaursian for my babys rights?

20090219192929AAnXwOr	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Guys being called HUN?!?	I won't go into the long history of our relationship.. just the quick facts are that..   1) him and I are really really good friends   2) neither of us have had a relationship before, but we probably both should have by our age   3) we've never hung out outside of school.. but we have many times at school when we didn't have to. i asked him to go for a walk with me once, but he couldn't, so he has promised to come with me the next time i go..   4) I'm pretty much the only girl he talks to a lot, you never see him talking to any girls but me. and I talk to a few but minimal guys, it's just the way we are. but we get along great      now.. onto the question..   i was talking to him tonight.. i won't explain the whole conversation.. just pretty much..   ME: "well good luck with that hun, but no one will believe ya" (i've never called him hun before, i call a few close people that, it's just kinda what I call people sometimes. I do in naturally, i just called him it cause it's what i normally would say there"   HIM: "Hun?"   ME: "yeah, it's what I call people :P"   HIM: "haha, i'm your hun now"   ME: "haha :P"      Pretty much for the rest of the conversation I called him hun and he called me this thing that I'd have to explain but it'd take too long :P      QUESTIONS: Guys, would you find it weird a friend of yours that's a girl called you hun? Guys, do you take being called hun in a specific way? Do you think it's a good thing he said that he's my hun now?

20090219191054AA42398	Family & Relationships;Friends	Do you ever feel you were never meant to have any friends?	I'm a 19 year old guy that is about to turn 20 years old. No matter how hard I try I simply cannot seem to make any friends at all. I've tried to introduce myself to so many different people to show them who I am but nothing ever clicks. It seems they already have own little "groups" at the time and are uninterested in letting me in. Life just sucks right now. I moved out on my own a few months ago, so I can no longer rely on my mother for social interacting, except for an occasional phone call. My father, whom I've never met, ditched my mother when he found out that she was pregnant with me. Growing up without a father figure was never a big deal until later in life I began to feel like there was a large void in my life and that the void was created by my father leaving my mother and I. Growing up I lived with my abusive grandparents who never wanted to take care me. I finally reunited with my mother at the age of 12 after she remarried. As you can see, I've had the unpleasant pleasure of being kicked around.      I'm always questioning as to whether or not I'm just too tall(6'1)? Too fat(205)? Too ugly? Or is it that there just aren't any people around here that have the same interests as I do? I'm getting so sick of not having one single friend. I'm really starting to question why I even bother going on in life. Do any of you ever feel like that? I mean, I was so carelessly conceived that I guess I could be wasting space. Maybe that's what people are think when I try to talk to them. I DON"T KNOW!   Do any of you feel the same way I do?

When she first started to date Rick, I liked him. I thought he was a nice polite man. Then, he started being a real dick all of a sudden. He constantly gets into our business (my mother and me.)       When they got Married he was nice at first. I'm almost sick of going to visit them. He parades around the house playing alpha male and teaches his son the same manners. He's a nice man to my mom but he's a real jerk towards me. If I have feelings of anger he gets angry right back. When he knows that he has pissed me off then he gets all nice and buys me stuff whenever we go shopping. I never told my mom about his recent "attacks" towards me because she gets all offended. And although he is nice to me after his being a dick, it's difficult to forget about how rude he is.       So...what should I do??

I'm 6'3", broad shouldered, and started losing my hair at 17, so I'm forced to shave it now, so I look like some meathead soldier or cop or something.  I don't care if some guys would wish they were bigger...and hearing that some girls actually like big bald guys makes me feel worse.  That may be difficult to understand...think of it this way: some guys find fat girls totally sexy, but that doesn't mean a fat girl will appreciate the fact that a guy notices her extra pounds.  It's the same way with me....I'm not so desperate for acceptance that any girl who tells me "I love a big man" will make me change my thinking (though I joke that Kate Winslet or Anne Hathaway could make me reconsider it).      I've never attracted a single girl I liked, and I gave most of them a chance just to make sure I wasn't making snap judgments. Just as I predicted, they were needy, desperate, and looking for a father figure. Creepily enough, all of them wanted to be dominated sexually: if I held them down by their wrists and overpowered them, they were in ecstasy and I hated myself even more.  This seems to be standard among many women...what was creepy was how many of them told me (in bed) that I reminded them of their father.      I can lose weight, but I can't get my hair back nor can I change my general stature. I hate it, but I can't do anything about it. I don't know how to get over it.  I did virtually everything save get a toupee: I did Rogaine and Propecia, I had hair transplants done by the best surgeon in Beverly Hills (on Rodeo Drive, no less).      Oh, and please don't tell me to "learn to love yourself the way you are" or assure me that "some girl will come along who loves you for your inner beauty". Also, don't tell me that "the right girl" won't care how I look...we all care about appearances.  Those who claim not to care are either those trying to avoid seeming shallow or those who cannot afford to be choosy.

My friend really likes this guy and today one of our friends was joking around and then told her crush that she likes him.

He left this morning around 9:30 to go out of town to take his mother to an interview.

20090219193036AASuaXw	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How would you rate this one ?	Saturday morning I got up early, quietly dressed,    made my lunch, grabbed the dog, and slipped quietly into the    garage.       I hooked up the boat up to the truck, and    proceeded to back out into a torrential downpour.       The wind was blowing 50 mph, so I pulled back    into the garage, turned on the radio, and discovered that    the weather would be bad all day.       I went back into the house, quietly undressed,   and slipped back into bed.       I cuddled up to my wife's back, now with a    different anticipation, and whispered, 'The weather out    there is terrible.'       My loving wife of 10 years replied, 'Can you    believe my stupid husband is out fishing in that?'       And then the fight started …!
20090219191928AAhDN3w	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Guys, women too, let me know how you would rate this one?	This couple go to an agricultural show way out in the countryside    a fine Sunday afternoon and are watching the auctioning off of    bulls.    The guy selling the bulls announces the first bull to be auctioned    off, "A fine specimen, this bull reproduced 60 times last year."    The wife nudges her husband in the ribs and comments, "See! That    was more than 5 times a month!"    The second bull is to be sold, "Another fine specimen, this wonder    reproduced 120 times last year."    Again the wife bugs her husband, "Hey, that's some 5 times a    month. What do you say to that?"    Her husband is getting really annoyed with this comparison.    The third bull is up for sale, "And this extraordinary specimen    reproduced 365 times last year!"    The wife slaps her husband on the arm and yells, "That's once a    day, every day of the year! How about you?"    The husband was pretty irritated by now and yells back, "Sure,    once a day! Great! But, you ask the auctioneer if they were all    with the same cow!"

20090219191928AAfAqWR	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Love partner, but not in love - is this a bad thing?	Our relationship is great, but I'm not *in* love. I don't get butterflies, or long to see him when we are apart. We talk every day, several times a day and I run out of things TO say.      We HAVE been having a rough time lately. The deeper the relationship goes the more we learn that we have different values, moral standards & political beliefs. He's a wonderful man who is very good to me.      I do love him, care about him deeply & want to be with him. But there's not that extra something. Is this a sign that we aren't going to make it as a couple? The thought of not being with him makes me sad. But, I'm afraid we don't have enough 'glue' besides our willingness to compromise and love to hold us together.      Please advise.

I am a woman in her 40s, single and without children. It happened as I did not meet a guy that I honestly thought it would last with. I live a responsible life, have a job which keeps me and allows me to travel now and then. I have many friends and don't take drugs or alcohol. In other words, really I live a moral life. Do you think that I am seen as cold as I didn't just settle down and become a wife and Mother? By the way, I am not gay, I like guys, but just know that many marriages break and don't want that for myself. Luckily, I get asked out as I take care of my appearance.

OK I admit I was a pretty lousy and insecure husband (and a micromanager) and I'm OK that shes better off without me.  It's been three years and we both have new mates. My problem is she won't communicate with me about the kids.   Ever since the judge awarded her half the child support she was asking for (we have the kids 50-50) she's been calling me a dead beat dad and looser dad now she barely returns my calls.   I just want to be on the same level and on the same page when it comes to raising our three boys.   How do I re-connect with her as 'friends only' or at least get her to treat me as a co-parent. (oh BTW I'm a good dad, responsible, connected, caring to my children).

20090219164834AAzzlDg	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	My mom is pregnant again, and i hate my stepdad so MUCH! help?	My mom and dad have married for like 16 years now? And a few months ago my mom had another baby, and they had a big fued right after it was born because my dad didn't think it was his, turns out after a DNA test...it wasn't. It was my dads best friends. So they divorced, and my mom married my stepdad for the baby, and now my dad is all depressed and my mom and stepdad are just digusting, and they dont pay attention to us (she has a son, and 3 daughters btw) and shes PREGNANT AGAIN! ughhh. its so weird and disgusting its not even funny. I want to move out, i want to go and live with my aunt. but they would never go for it, i want to get my sister out of there, and my brother and sister do too. My stepdad thinks i am like 4, and thinks he is my dad and will be like "Bella, did you brush your teeth YOUNG LADY???" and will smile and bend his legs and put his hands on his knees to (get down on my level) its SOOO gay.I can't stand it, and if i say a word my mom comes unglued and then my stepdad will gripe at me, and my mom just stands there.      The worst is...it all happened so fast. She had the baby, and then they were divorced, and now shes married again. Its sickening. And my dad has become extremely violent, i am always afraid when i talk to him he is going to hit me, cuz he starts yelling and its really scary. I hate this.      Can anyone help?

20090219115739AA3K0WA	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Uifsa  child support problem - set too low by $1000 - I am in the states and he ran off?	My husband took out a child support order to pay child support for the kids, in Canada. This was clever. He had not paid any, but he lied to the court, and they gave him a divorce based on that. In Canada, they won't give anyone a divorce unless they promise to pay child support.      So he got a divorce, with no alimony, no pension, he kept the house, everything...     But he is supposed to pay child support.       For a start, he doesn't pay it at all.      I could go to court here to get it enforced.      But - it is set at Canada rates. Which are $1000 lower than the state where I live.       There is this horrible thing called UIFSA which says that child support orders can only be modified in the place they were taken out.      It's obviously designed to protect women - but in this weird case, the man took out the child support order.        Would I have to go to Canada - 3000 miles away - to modify it? Or can I do something here in the state where I live?         I am really upset that the Canadian court gave him this divorce. He got it without even telling me there was a hearing. And his lawyer is supposed to be really good with abused women....what a hypocrite...      There was no mention of child custody in the divorce he got, nor of visitation. He doesn't want to see the kids or have anything to do with them, because his girlfriend wouldn't like it.        Anyway, does anyone know what I can do?
20090219120747AAYvQ56	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	AM I CRAZY OR SHOULD I BE MAD & FEEL BETRAYED?	My boyfriend that I have lived with for the last 3 years went to pick up his son for regular scheduled visitation. We rode together because one of our cars was broken down and we were sharing the mini-van and we other errands to run including picking up our two other children. Upon arriving his son's mother refused to turn over his son to him because she saw that I was in the car. Out of desperation my boyfriend actually asked me if he could drop me off at the gas station while he came back to get his son. I was appalled to say the least. To make a long story short I did not dare let him leave me standing alone at a gas station in the dark to satisfy the ridiculous crap that his son's mother was pulling. We called the police and about an hour later the officer arrived and informed his son's mother that her request was ridiculous and she would be in violation of a court order if she did not give her son to his father per the court order. So his son was handed over (did I mention his son was 4 years old and by this point was hysterically crying). Now I never no matter what even if it is a hardship to our family am I ever allowed to be anywhere near him and his son's mother when they make the switch off. My b/f seems to resent me for not agreeing to be dropped off at a gas station in the dark because he thinks that would have just been easier to give his son's mother her way. I just feel like he betrayed me and I can not seem to get over these feelings.

(Currently at Feb 18 09 we are all 13 now) We have a lot of commmon and it feels like shes one of my bestest friends ever....we talk on AIM and we talk a lot about our lives. well when we started to know eachother she started to introduce her other friends in her chat rooms. i met LOTS of her friends; but only like about 5 i really have a good friendship and were like best friends now; including her. we all have so much in common and can relate to eachothers lives so easily and we have a lot in common with each of the friends. it feels like i know them in real life i just only talk to them online...      (my real life friends know about this and they think im weird for doing this, but i just cant take it. only one of my real life friend talks to them because i know my friend dosnt think its weird.)      well anyway....throughout these years, we still kept in contact and i know she isnt a stalker or anything. shes a normal girl my age who is a lot like me. she posted pictuers of her self and also her friends do too; a bunch of them and so i know there real. i talked to a few of them on the phone. there like my bestest friends even though i dont know her in real life. its just this thing i cant explain that makes us so close. i wish i went to the same school as them too; were all asian and in my school; asians are always getting picked on and always insulted by being asian. but there school is filled with asians. i was just wondering if we should meet in the summer but how do i tell my parents and stuff? i know that my uncle lives close to all of them. should i not tell my parents and say like one of my friend moved to there and i want to meet them at like the mall or something?   i really want to meet them and so do they. if i would have one wish i would wanna meet them; thats how bad i would like to see them for once. i hope you guys can help me and tell me a good thing to do about this problem. if this friendship hasnt fallen apart yet for 3 years; i know that god wanted us to meet.   thanks a lot !

20090219193136AAZnhNZ	Family & Relationships;Friends	Tell me: how do i get over him? please help me?	basically a little less than a year ago i started liking a guy friend of mine and it was kind of because i had thought he liked me. he is actually a huge flirt with other girls also. he hadn't (i had found out from a mutual friend) but i still liked him. we became better and better friends and my feelings intensified (i guess). he's just basically the perfect guy; sweet, caring, smart, funny, and totally cute. i found out from him a little while back who he liked and not to my surprise it wasn't me. so i know he doesn't like me and we're really close friends, but there's still that small part of me that likes him as more than a friend.[last night we watched 2 movies (tommy boy and then the notebook) in his basement, we ate burgers and played scrabble and then he walked me home bc it was midnight- he's just really cute in tht way] but we are good friends and i think we just continue to be closer as friends but how do i get over him? (i see him every week and ignoring him is just not an option.)

She becomes like someone you'd see on "Cops." Hide the cutlery. Seriously. :-(      Meanwhile, I come from the same background and have become somewhat refined. We had the same opportunities to advance in all these years.      Did your spouse revert to being trashy soon after the marriage?

20090203103645AA1zRLn	Family & Relationships;Family	I feel like my sister hates me now. ?	Ok so she lives with me and my mom still, shes 23 and has a 5 month old my niece who i love like my own child. I take care of her almost all day. I never once got a thank you. It really bugs me.       Shes always likes me and my mom to be quiet when Chloe is sleeping like when my moms and i are talking or something, were not even that loud. My mom shut the patio door and the windows were open so it shut kinda loud. Chloe woke up and my sister came out and was like thanks for waking her up. She was sleeping for 2 hours, that's longer than she usually naps for. I said if its too loud go live somewhere else. She left. Now she wont  even say a word to me.       She just went somewhere, she didn't even ask me if i want to go with her. She never goes anywhere with Chloe alone.       Chloe would probably not even be alive right now if i were not here. My sis has very little patients for her. She hates kids. Never wanted one but she had unprotected sex andd she  got prenant. My mom pays for all the diapers and stuff. The government pays for her formula and baby food. Which is stupid! Shes her mom and should pay for all of her stuff and have her own house, car, and be married or at least with the father!      Im sorry its so long! What should i do? I feel so bad i said that to her! She hates me now! That was the only time ive ever said anything bad to her. Im very good to her and i never have gotten a dollar from her for helping her. I hate myself now!
20090203105325AA8aef6	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Difference between men cheating and leaving a relationship and a woman cheating and leaving a relationship?	It seems when a man leaves....he still holds on to the relationship he left for longer then a woman would that left a relationship and comes back more often then a woman would. Do you think that a woman is less likely to regret leaving a relationship then a man would be? Are women more sure before they make that decision? Opinions from males and females appreciated. I just see so many more men regretting it and trying to reconcile with their woman later down the line then women do. I hear it all the time at work...out and about. When a women leaves wether it was wrong how she left or not...is she more likely to not regret it then a man would be?

We got off really great, we tell each other practically everything about what's going on in our lives and we practically like the same things!   She brings up a guy she likes with me and sometimes asks me for advice, not with the guy she likes but some personal stuff.  I'm fine with listening to her talk about the guy she likes but there's one thing.  Everytime I talk about the girl I like she becomes mum.  It's like she goes from peppy and eccentric to just ... I don't know.  Not excited about listening, she says stuff like "uh huh" and "yeah" as if she's disinterested.      I don't know, I don't demand a lot of respect, but do you guys think this is a tad rude?  I'm gonna hang out with her a bit this weekend, but I'm not sure if I should. I don't feel too comfortable with her now.  I don't want to talk to her about it now because I could be wrong, but I want to know what you guys think.      Thanks.

20090219203102AA0DtbH	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	To marry or not to marry?	I have been with my love for a while now and I am deeply in love with him. He will surprise me with sweet things like flowers take me to dinners and movies (I as well make plans for us at take him out to do fun things, we have taken trips and just have fun as a couple) you would say "Wow nice man" yes he is when he wants to be BUT, we have been arguing more and more as of late and it used to be that when he was wrong he would admit it freely. The last 3 months have been horrible, the way our fights turn out is that I am wrong and he is right (well he feels he is). He gets very loud, shakes and just gets very angry at times. He has never ever hit me EVER or laid a hand on me. However he has hit the wall and has punched the bedpost so hard his hand still hurts from time to time. He is Marine Combat Recon Force Instructor and has seen a lot of action in his days, as he has students to train and maybe that is why seems to have the issues with being right all the time. When we do have issues we start out by putting them on the table but it escalates very fast into a fight and he will not let me get a word in edgewise. I have to ask him over and over to let me talk. We do live together and it is just getting to the point that I am not sure if I want to marry him. Yes its great when its great and we do try to work on it we talked about counseling and we need it but honestly have you ever felt your heart is not in it as much anymore. Have any of you ever been there. If so, please help me out I really wanna find the spark, but not sure my heart says stay.

20090219195931AAu8sVx	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What do you do if you married a man who wasnt ready to commit?	My husband and I have been married 9 months. We are a young couple. During the past few weeks, he has DRASTICALLY changed. He is shutting me out and being unaffectionate. I feel like he's trying to make me so uncomfortable that I will leave without him asking me to. I just read this article on yahoo.com -     http://dating.personals.yahoo.com/single...       This part exactly describes him- "If he's not ready, he won't be able to handle the negative aspects of a relationship, and he'll either shut down -- and shut you out -- or bail."      But this is an article about whether a man will marry you or not. We're already married. So what should I do? Should I wait for him to reallize what I mean to him so he knows he made the right decision to commit to me? Should I give up and let him push me out of his life?

Ok I'm in college and theres this shy girl who really doesnt talk to a lot of people but she has a few friends. She started talking and I can tell she really likes me by the nonverbal communications and how I catch her stairing at me, now I just found out she has a boyfriend back home. When we talk she only mentioned him once. Now I told her that I liked her but I knew she had a boyfriend and everything and she acted so differently to me after that it was actually really awkward. So we agreed on being fridends but she still avoids me. Then she text me saying she was sorry i got that impression and she loves her b/f but i am confused because she did like all the nonverbal signs that a girl likes a guy and would stare. All I said is that I thought she liked me so wouldnt a normal girl with a strong relationship with her b/f say "I'm sorry I led you on and we can be friends? So why is she avioding me and not talking to me if we agreed on being friends?

20090203103048AA0ivb6	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Reception a different day from wedding?	My future husband and I are getting married privately at his Aunt's house. The reason for this is:  1. We wanted a very small ceremony with close family only  2. His Grandmother is 95 and she can't really go many places due to wheelchair access. It's important to us that she be there.     So, Some time after the wedding ceremony (unknown as of yet) we want to have a reception to celebrate with our extended family and friends. My question is, How would this reception be structured? Do you still do the traditional dances? Obviously there will not be a garter or bouquet toss. Any ideas?    Also, If you intend to post about how it's rude to have a private ceremony save your time and don't. :-) We do not intend to register for gifts or anything of the sort, it's not about the presents, it's about the celebration of a special moment in our lives.Thanks!

20090203103409AAme92U	Family & Relationships;Friends	Need friend advice to help my child?	Things for her in the “girl world” have slowly been going down hill since the beginning of the year and lately it has not been good.  I am very worried about her.  She is doing great academically and things are going great for her with sports.  Her social life outside of school has seemed to crash.  When I try to talk to her about it she listens, takes my advice and says it is good but then does not follow through.  She said things are fine in school with kids in her classes, lunch, etc. and on the team but when it comes to outside of school she is a very lonely girl. Last night she opened up a little more but then when I talk she is close to tears…shuts down and ignores me…doesn’t respond…goes directly to her room. She was apart of a big group of kids who were out every weekend together and now she is ignored…for no apparent reason…just not interested in her anymore. They are not being mean to her in any way…just distant.  Am I pushing her too hard…could she be falling into depression?  When she is at home she is happy but if any subject comes up about friends or she hears of things going on without her…she is on the verge of tears and very hostile to the rest of the family. I do point out to her that she has stopped putting any effort into making things better…no effort into trying to be friends with her group…no effort into finding new friends. She feels if anyone wants her as a friend or to do something…they will contact her…she doesn’t want to push herself on to anyone.  She 100% relies on me and her father for her entertainment and as long as she has us around she makes no effort. Her texting has gone from about 4,000 messages a month to about 500 a month.  She has one friend in the group who has been going through the same thing but this girl is trying really hard to make things better and now she finds her annoying…says her friend is trying but it is getting her no where.  I told her that it will take time…won’t happen over night.  That was the last one in the group that kept her connected.  I have also noticed that when anything comes up that she is invited to she complains and has anxiety but when I pick her up she said she had a great time.             So I don’t know if my worries are me overreacting or is this something serious that I need to handle.  I don’t want to make things worse for her by trying to help her and maybe I should leave her to fix things. She keeps saying things are fine but yet her eyes fill up with tears. I have told her over and over that if she puts effort into it she can make things better.  I see her at games or getting her from practice…they are all laughing together and having fun.  When I drive some of them home from practice or games they joke and talk.  I told her that if no one liked her that they would not be this way.
20090219200127AAjQK1U	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Okays, so I got nervous and I messed up. What should I do?	Okay so there is this guy that I have a crush on and every time I see him around campus he always says "hi, Anne" and smiles at me. (We meet in a class last semester, but we never hung out or anything.)      So the other night I was walking through the library and I had kind of passed the table that he was working at, but he looked up suddenly and said, "Oh, hey!" and smiled. I turned my head and of course said hi back, but then proceeded on my way.       Looking back now, I really should have stopped and asked him how he was doing and everything, but I got nervous and it didn't occur to me at the time.       I think I probably came off a little on the snotty, rude side and I am afraid I totally messed up.       What should I do?

20090219195907AA5rESL	Family & Relationships;Family	Do I need to change for my mom?	My mother constantly tells me that she's depressed with my ways. And she'll say "if you don't change, I'm not doing....for you" or "why should I...If you don't change". I'm not a badly behaved person, I  get good grades in school, I don't even have personal time for myself. And she never says good work or praises me in any way. I'm a shy and not very outgoing person and I tend not to share my feelings with her. It's seldom that I do share my feelings with my mother and when I do it turns into a verbal mess. I'm really tired of feeling like crap after she tells me I need to change my ways. Just because I may look sad or blah she gets mad at me. My mother says "I'm not trying to bring you down..." but basically she does. I don't stress it because it happens often, and I just don't care anymore. By the way she's very materialistic (she'll by me clothing or something when I don't ask or need it). I know I shouldn't care what other people think, how do I cope with her stressing "change" towards me.
20090219195647AANFaZC	Family & Relationships;Friends	I miss a friend terribly?	okayy well i used to be wicked close with this boy. He is a junior in highschool and im only a freshman. We hung out everyday and had feelings for eachother at once. We used to flirt all the time and ive been through alot with him. When he got his licsence he changed he started smoking pot and acting too cool for me. I did do it with him for a little and it brought us back to the way it was, but doing that is just not me. So i quit and its back to missing my bestfriend. He hangs out with the wrong group of friends and does what anyone tells him to do. I am worried about him and i miss the way he used to be soo much. I wish there was a way to go back. It hurts soo much to think he can walk by and not say hi to me.

20090219195559AAkUAKZ	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Why is it so hard to leave my unhappy marriage?	I am so sad, so sad, so sad, I married my husband based on love, but all he has done in the past 3 years is hurting me day and night. He makes me feel ugly, he never ever listens to me, when I sing every single time, he asks me to turn the volume down, when I dance, every time, he tries to stop me, when I talk he rarely pays attention, to the point that I am always quiet at home, because I know it's better not to say anything than being hurt. OMG, he has nothing to offer me, he doesn't show love, or nothing. I am so depressed. I can't believe that it's so hard for me to make a decision and leave him. Nothing is working, ever, no amount of talking, begging for attention, thinking about different ways,,, nothing works. I have wasted 3 years of my life in total misery day and night. I can't get out,,,, why is it so hard? Why does it look impossible? I am a student, getting $800 pcm paying the rent and bills with that, he works gets $2000 and pays $800 for nursery of our kid and spends the rest of it on his TV, car and mobile habits. If I leave, I can't afford the nursery money, he is a US citizen and I am a conditional green card holder,,,, I am scared about everything. What should I do?
20090203102119AAxnRsN	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Woman in love with one lust with another?	Why is that a man can have a relationship with a married woman while he is married and no one really says to much.  But if a married woman is seeing a married man she is a homewrecker, and every other name in the book. I think the best name yet was the soul-less reptile **itch.  I just want to know why it's such a double standard - men call you names and other women call you worse.

Okay.... my friend who is a little under average is very persistant that him and his girlfriends sex is soooo amazing, and shes loves it blah blah  blah. he took her virginity and hes the only guy shes been with. I cant take him serious because hes been my friend for a very long time and he isnt as "endowed" as i am. (fact) I want to show her wat real sex is but... hes my best friend so i cant. So first... is it wrong for me to want to make her feel like a real women.      and second girls... is it the size of the boat or is it the motion of the ocean.

At this time, he was VERY much in love with me but, I must claim that I was blind because I gave him up for another.      Now, divorcing the one I gave him up for and we ran into each other last week for the first time in FOREVER!      He seemed happy to see me but, he is engaged now (aren't I the luck one)? Well, anyways, I know his girl wasn't around and we talked for about 20 minutes. I couldn't help but look in his eyes...I missed them so! Well, he could NOT seem to look me in the eyes for more than a minute or so...he kept turning his head & looking all around.      Why do you suppose he had SUCH a hard time making eye contact?   Vulnerability? Shyness (that has never been a problem for him in the past)? Any thoughts? I am baffled!

He also pretends to be a baby when we cuddle!        How do I politely tell him that there is no way on earth that I could be sexually attracted to a 23 year old man who acts like that!  We've been dating for 1.5 years and it wasn't until fairly recently he became mentally challenged.
20090219195414AAICe3y	Family & Relationships;Family	What can I do when my family members drink and drive?	I've gone out to dinner and bars with my family- dad, mom, and cousins. It's mean to say, but they're all alcoholics and they don't care. So whenever they go out, they get drunk and then drive home.       They sometimes drink and drink, then they wait an hour or two and assume they're fine enough to drive- I don't know if that's true. There was a time that I didn't have anything to drink so I could be the DD, but when I went to get in the driver's side, my dad yelled at me and drove us home. I was scared, he swerves.      What can I do to make this stop? I don't want them or anyone else to die.
20090219194421AAjhQ1k	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Would you marry someone who didn't want you to work?	I met my fiance 2 years ago and we decided to get engaged, he asked me 4 months ago but we recently called it off tonight. Everything is pretty good except in this area that I can't compromise on. He wants me to stay at home and not work. It scares me because marriages fail as much as they succeed, with the 50% divorce rate. I feel like I can't completely rely on a man for the rest of my life. I could but I don't want to. This is my deal breaker.      What if we get divorced in the future, then what will become of me? Alimony is so rare these days, a lot of times there are cutoff points to how much alimony you can receive. I feel like I have these dreams I want to follow and why wouldn't he want me to follow them.      I even asked him if he loved me then why wouldn't he want me to follow my dreams. I encourage him with his. Its just so frustrating. On top of that, I spent 4 years in college, why should I throw away my education? I don't want to be one of those women who relies on a guy for money. I love earning my own money.      Anyway we got into a huge fight and he said that he wants his wife to stay at home and I said that I needed to be in control of my own destiny and gave him back the engagement ring.

I can live independently if I can for most part w/ a bit of help from my family & friends who shares the same personality as I do. However, I been told by my family to leave the friends that I think are my friends (opposite personality). What is your best friend like? HA, I sometimes see my dog (Beagle breed) to be my true best friend. She listens whenever I got a problem or conversations in mind. She cuddles me when I'm sad or alone. Seriously, it is sad how much love a caring creature like my dog is so much better to be w/ in company. Unfortunately, my dog is w/ my family. Therefore, I don't see her much b/c I'm in college an hour away from home. Even my baby nephews & nieces cheer me up more than adults do. Please, someone give me tips & advices that can cheer me up on my own even when I'm alone! No rude comments please. I value respect highly.
20090219194350AAFyQY2	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Does Marrige REALLY work?	I am turning 19 soon and dont know what to expect in the future. I have never really been into the whole marrige thing but i can accept that if i find the right person i might be willing to settle down but there seems to be so much stigma attached to marrige. Is it possible having learned everything about your partner to then become bored? Can you still be sexually attracted to them years down the line? Will all those little things still give you the same feelings? Can you be with the same person for the rest of your life and feel satisfied, physically, mentally and every other way possible?  Is it possible to stay faithful and if so is it a hard battle fighting the temptation to cheat? I know alot of husbands find that thier wifes lose their sexual desires and dont wanna get intimate. What is up with that? Married ladies get at me with that issue!!! It just sounds like marriage kills romance and that falling in love definetly has an expiry date. How many people actually are happily married? I'm not talking about those that are still married for the sake of the kids or those that cant afford a divorce or for the convience of the relationship kind of marriges or  those that are afraid to be alone. I'm talking about real, deeply in love, cant imagine being with another person mutual kind of marriges       I wanna hear all your thoughts but mainly would like to hear from those who are married or divorced  and whether your happy or not and why.... and your views on my above theories       Thanks

URGENT HELP!!!?	**SORRY FOR THE WALL OF TEXT, BUT IT'S URGENT!!!***      Ever since my parents divorced, my brother and I went to live with my brother and I've paid more attention to him, and grown to love him more as a sibling, and past the "icky brother" level. However, he's a HUGE loser, and refuses to admit it. (I'm 16, he's 19).      He gets into fights with his brothers too much (he loves to fight with me and deem he's "stronger" than a girl like me when he "beats me up"), is on the computer every day, has never had a job, refuses to GET one in the first place, and doesn't have any friends. I've tried to encourage him to get a job, and talked to our parents about it, but they counter with that he's a full-time college student, and has no time for that (despite the fact that he gets home from class every day and gets straight on the computer or plays video games the rest of the day).      They also counter with that he's doing just fine, and he needs no job for he has no needs for things (despite him having a "buy-me-for-presents" video game list stuck on the fridge which he begs everybody to get him during his birthday and christmas). My parents also give him everything he wants: cellphone, ipod, laptop, etc etc, while I've had to work for everything i own.      I've been trying to let him know that getting a job is more about getting a sense of responsibility than the money & how it'll look on your resume (my parents say a summer gig at McDonalds won't help much with his resume later on - WHICH IS TRUE, but that's not the only reason for a job). They pay ALL his college tuition (textbooks included!), and he's never dished in a SINGLE dime for ANY expenses. EVER.      He doesn't have any friends (he never goes out of the house), and my parent's excuse to that is that he's too "shy" (he's shy, but honestly, SERIOUSLY... -___-) to make some, and it's alright. When house guests come over, people try to talk to him, but he just grunts "yes" and "no" in return, and starts muttering after they leave about how "annoying" they are.      My brother is a huge loser and refuses to admit my parents are spoiling him endlessly. Please help me. I want to know if I'M the one wrong here, and he's not a loser like my parents say.      Is he a loser, or isn't he?
20090219195037AAuJzgc	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Is it Abuse? what should i do?	My mom doesn't really let me do much, cause either she's to busy or my sister has something more important to do. I haven't hung out with anyone since October 2008, cause my mom won't let me. And last year she dragged me across the floor by my hair and almost killed me when she strangled me. The worst part is that i can't do anything about cause if i do my mom said she will kill me, and i don't wanna live with my dad. And i will have to if my mom looses custody. i don't know what to do anymore, and lately i have been thinking about suicide, and running away. I don't know if its abuse cause my mom can be loving sometimes, but other times she treats me like i don't exsist or like dirt.
20090219203049AAtIjeK	Family & Relationships;Family	If my Mom only hurts me sometimes is it Abuse?	I just want to know, cause my mom has hurt me in the past, and she kina psychologically abuses me, but she doesn't physically abuse me all the time in fact she hasn't done it since May 2008. Can this still be considered abuse.

Ok, so I got a new boyfriend  a week ago, I really like him.. but I don't know how to tell my mom, I REALLY want to tell her because I trust her and I tell her everything, I just need to say it the right way....      So any sugestions?
20090219195440AAsngwY	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What have I done? I never thought that I would find myself in this kind of situation.?	Ok, so here it goes. I'm married to a wonderful man. He is a great father to our children. Somehow, I have managed to find myself in love with another man who is also married with children. We have been having an affair for the last several months. When it first started it was like I had found myself once again, like I had been locked up in a closet for the last 15yrs that I have been married. Then it started getting more serious, and I found myself doing things I never thought I could do. The bad part is I am friends with his wife.  I never in a million years would have thought that I would find myself in this situation. I love this man so much, and there is not a doubt in my mind if he would leave his wife to be with me that I would leave my husband. But I don't think that is an option. He says he loves me, but we both have families and we need to keep them together. I really don't think I can go on like this for years but at the same time the days that I do get to see him and be with him it makes me hold on that much more. I don't think I have the strength to let go of him without it tearing my family apart in the end. What am I going to do?

20090219195711AAE832C	Family & Relationships;Friends	I honestly can't believe she would say that... what should I do?	So, recently my friend (lets call her T) has been in kind of an argument with this guy (he can be called B). Yes, he's been rude to a lot of mine and her friends and hasn't been the most polite person ever, but I know she over exaggerated the situation (like she does with almost everything).       So, I found out today that B's sister died last night and like any person should, I felt terrible for the rest of the day.    T on the other hand, when I told her, just said "you shouldn't feel bad about it. He's a jerk." So first off I was annoyed at that, because I couldn't understand her lack of sympathy.       THEN, when it was brought up later between the two of us(during homeroom I might add) she told me that "it's just charma that his sister died"      I was so pissed off. I kind of spazzed and told her "it's not fricking charma that she died." and left it at that, because the classroom was quiet and I didnt really want to make a scene.       Should I say anything to her?? (and no, this isnt the only thing I'm upset at her for, but other things would take too long to explain).      I really cant just leave it alone, because its absolutely unbelievable that anyone could say something like that. Please answer, thanks.

I found out that the guy I was dating had already been involved with someone the entire time we were dating and is now engaged to her. We were together for 2 1/2 years. I told his fiancee everything about us and that I wasn't the only one he cheated with. She wanted to meet with me at first because I had proof of the relationship but then she called back saying that she had all the proof she needed. She apologized to me for everything I went through with him, we had a very rough relationship.He also lied and said she was his ex. Why would she do this? Is it because she believed everything I told her.

20090203102152AAuLmX8	Family & Relationships;Friends	How can we fix our friendship?	My best friend and I live in a dorm together up at college. Everything was going fine until I broke up with my then boyfriend.    Her boyfriend was friends with him, and he started hating me.      Everything I did seemed to be something horrible, and since he comes up and stays over night twice a week, I'm hardly in the room at all.      Its not my fault that my current boyfriend lives in these dorms. Its like she's jealous of me for being able to see my bf when i want to.      The other issue is that we HATE each others boyfriends. And our frienship has disenigrated because all we do is sleep in the same room, instead of doing things together.   Now, I do invite her to come to meals with everyone, and I go to the gym with her, but we just don't have fun anymore.      So here's my question:      How can we fix this?   We HATE the boyfriends, and we don't ever have fun anymore.      I don't want to lose another best friend, especially when I didn't do anything wrong.   To be honest, she's been so focused on her boyfriend and so selfish, that I've been pushed aside.   Her boyfriend is incredibly mean to me, no matter how nice I am.

Well, not to give too much detail but my ex left me in May of 2008, said that he wanted to be with another woman and, it hurt me really bad. A few weeks ago he broke up with the other woman and came back to me, we are not together just friends but, when I asked him why he mistreated me he said that he was afraid. He said that he was afraid that my feelings for him weren't as strong as I thought they were because he was my first and, maybe I needed to experience other men. Now he tells me that he thought about me all the time and truly cares for me, I don't know what to think, yes I still love him, but, I don't want to be stupid again.

This eventaully made me break our lease and he moved back home.  And me and my daughter are staying with friends till we can get back on our feet.  He says he loves me but when I tell him what I need he says I don;t want to hear this **** I'm tired of your complaining, but then over time he says I'm sorry for being such a an *** and I believe him and try again... This month has been a long month... We made plans opne weekend and out of nowhere he says I don;t think were going to work out, and disappears.  And of course I beg and plead as he ignores my texts and calls for days and then reappears and says I don't know what I was thinking I love you.  So I take him back. Ugg. He did again last weekend, to come back and say baby I'm here I'm just giving you time to figure out what you want??? I think it's the other way around though.  So of course I talk and we get through it and try again.  I asked him to come see me tomorrow and he said he's too lazy these days and doesn't feel like doing anuthing and I tell him that he needs to meet me half way and give me what I need so I can give him what he needs and he said maybe I'm just not ready for a relationship, this is less than one day since we made up.  Then he texted me text me I'm sorry I said that.  Should I give him a taste of his own medicine and ignore him for a few days and see how he likes it?? Is it even worth it at this point?

20090219203431AArYDub	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What are the arguments for and against executing a battered woman who murdered her abusive husband?	two possible scenarios:  in one a man administered a beating to his 27 year old wife causing bruises over her arms and face. He left their home and when he returned two hours later his wife ambushed him with a shotgun blast killing him.      In the second scenario a 56 year old woman after years of chronic abuse from her husband decides she can no longer take and connives to murder him in his sleep.  The woman has tried to leave on at least several occasions but has always come back.  One night she carries out her plan murdering her husband in his sleep.      If both women have been sentenced to hang would you argue for the sentences to be carried out or for their lives to be spared,      Note the specific details of the examples are hypothetical and please note the question is not about whether these executions will take place.  Only whether they should or should not and why.      Put another way the question is about  treatment of battered woman accused of capital offenses in connection with their history of abuse

We were talking and she gave me her number. So we could text each-other. Since that day, we have been texting non-stop after school. (2:30pm-11pm).      She knows i like her. For the month of janurary we had about 6000-7000 texts combined back and forth. I was certain she liked me. But then, i found out she likes another guy.      I am really dissapointed. This girl (samantha) does not know how much i like her. I think she thinks its just a casual like like. But she doesnt know it.      I think about her everyday. I feel like i need her? I listen to songs (Everything by lifehouse) pretty much (i dont want to sound like gay) like tearing up/crying. I need her, and she doesnt know it, not that i know of.      We are in a really good friendship at the moment. She said i was her best guy friend, and that she loved me. (not the LOVE LOVE way, love as in a friendly love) She has not said it lately to me, so im not sure anymore.      We havnt been talking as much lately, because she doesnt always text me back anymore. Before, i really thought she likes me, but now i know she doesnt.      I told her i liked her, and i forget what she said.       please dont say, "just ask her out" or stuff like that.               I hope i typed this out well..can someone help, or give me advice?         Thank you to everyone that replies.

He has an aunt & uncle who live in NC, but other than that, I don't know anyone. My husband wants to go to the police academy where his relatives live (& his aunt is a cop in the county too). The county we would be moving to has 1 of the best nursing schools, which is what I want to do. I am scared, nervous, & everything that accompanies that. My mom is SO attached to my kids, she would be so upset. I would hate to leave her.

20090219204320AAYO9aE	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	He's stopped wanting to sleep with me?	We've been in a relationship for 6 motnhs, live together and between us have 3 kids. We're both in our early twenties. I have a very high sex drive and so did he or so I thought. When we first started dating we had sex all the time and he bragged to everyone of his guy friends about how amazing I am and how awesome our sex life was.       Now it's been a week and the last time we had sex we just gave up - neither one of us got off. I crave it all the time, think about him, want him... I'm a very attractive female.       Tonight, he lay with me for me to go to sleep and then he left to go back to the computer (he spends a ton of his time on the comp). I stayed up watching tv and then I heard dance music playing in the living room so I went out and he was watching porn, doing his thing by himself.      So I went in the room again and he came in totally uninterested in sex. He said he just doesn't want to have sex anymore. He said doing it solo is just different cause he can get in done in two minutes. So I've been so hurt and confused and don't understand or knows what to think!      What on earth does all this mean? He refuses to talk to me about it. I asked if there was anything wrong in our relationship right now. I've been depressed (I'm bipolar), and our sex life is bad. And he said maybe I need to answer the question. I asked what he meant and he said nothing. I said I just don't understand how he feels or what he is thinking and if he confided in me then maybe that would help and he just won't. But he loves me - I know that is true. We are very much in love. We have a good home, and a good family. I just don't get it~!      Any suggestions as to why a guy would not want to have sex with a perfectly sexy young woman? He's not gay I know that. He watches all straight porn and has slept with quite a few women...
20090219204340AAIwOpj	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Should I ask for a Divorce?	I am  married going on 4 years, We have 3 children, and we have an awesome relationship. we can talk all night. He still kisses me and kind of touches me once in a while. We have not had sex in 4 months and before that it was about 2 months and before that about 2 months, and on and on. I have talked to him about it and he just says hes tired or hes wore out or there is always an excuse and then hell say we are having sex tomorrow but it never happens? When we first got together we had sex all the time. I know hes not cheating he don't have time to cheat. I know everyone he works with and like I said we have a great relationship, there is trust. We are better friends than we are husband and wife. I know he loves me but my fear is that he loves me as a friend not as a wife. Please advise?

If a girl was to hook up with a guy while being really drunk and not even understanding what was happening, would you still consider her slutty or is not her fault since the guy was basically doing it without permission?

20090219204842AAgMXWC	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Is this a real marriage?	A couple who has to wait a little while to get a legalized married, but had a cultural and spiritual marriage with vows to self and God. If after this they consumate their marriage after waiting till then, is their marriage still not a real marriage if the state doesn't have it in their system yet?  (This ? has nothing to do with a certain religion/denomination opinion either)
