20090223025131AAxNg9a	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Where to get coupons for taking care of the baby?	How do you get these coupons for taking care of your baby. You know the ones where you can get milk and food for it. I think they are called wick coupons or something. They help you get mostly food for the baby While your pregnant and after your pregnant. I don't know weather or not to go to the health department or court house or human resources. I need to know I hope somebody knows what I am talking about.If you need more details then let me know and I will try to explain more.
20090223025110AAxj9KE	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	OK here is my story….?	My last period was on February 4. I started BD from the last day of my period which was the 8th of February and we had sex every day and every other day randomly up till today (February 23). I noticed really thin stretchy cervical mucus on the 20th which I think was my ovulation day cause one day prior to the stretchy mucus I also had sharp pains in my left ovary for about 30 minutes on and off in other words needle like pains. I usually have 25-29 day menstrual cycles, so I expect my period anywhere from March 1 – 5. Today I started having mild cramps in my lower abdomen and feel bloated and a little nauseous. I usually have cramps one week before my AF but this time the cramps are mild. I know that these symptoms are sometimes exactly identical when talking about AF and pregnancy, but I just need to know if I really ovulated on the 20th was the stretchy mucus a sign? And how soon should I take a HPT???

20090223025622AAIyNdJ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Can I actually win baby products?	I done a survey to get free baby items, but had to do the 3 silver, 2 gold things. I received the products that I actually chose as a trial period.  I've read on here that this doesn't work.  My visa card was used and the card was discontinued because the bank said these were not legal. So they are going to be sending me a new card and a new password.  My question is, if I dont sent the trial products back after the trial period, can they do anything.  Note, my card that I used to get the trial products is no long active, I am waiting on my new card.  Has anyone done this and not returned the products and if so, did they do anything to you?  Thanks for reading and sorry it was such a long post.  God bless.......

20090223032142AAOJAvK	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Is there a possibility that I'm still be pregnant?	Ok so me and my bf had sex with a condom the 2nd of this month. The condom broke and the next day I came on my period. However it was a weird period it didn't really come down the first day, it came down the next day and it wasn't too heavy and it only lasted for 4 days and It usually lasts 6 days. So maybe a few weeks later (2 to be exact) I took the HPT and it was negative but I still feel different. I don't know how to explain it but I just feel that there's something different about me. I'm not worried or stressed or anything I just want to know. these passed 3 weeks I've been fatigue, have had head aches and nausea.  I've also been bloated and had some gas and grossly enough Diarrhea (Embarrassing but heard these were signs too) . My period isn't due til like next week. So i'm thinking I'm gonna take another test if my period doesn't come, but I wanted to know is anyone has gotten pregnant this way. I talked to my mother and she said she got pregnant this way with my older brother and didn't know until she was 3 months. One reason was she still bled when she was pregnant. I just want to see if there's anyone else out there who's in this situation or has had this situation.

Random question, but I just came back from a bowling party for my boyfriends little brothers birthday, and I am 21 weeks pregnant. My boyfriend, the father, was a tad worried that the weight of the ball and how I throw it might be hurting the baby or putting to much strain on me.      I'm a pretty sucky player though so I don't see how I put to much strain on myself lol. But what do you think? Could bowling about 4 games at 21 weeks be a 'no no' for me now?      And to throw in some humor, my own little brother (age 13) totally owned me and I owe him 10 bucks now. What a uncle he will make! =P

20090223035355AACCsmT	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adoption	And HOW is foster care better the adoption..?	I hear this on here all the time.. foster care is better then adoption and/or should be done first instead of adoption and/or children should be adopted from foster care instead of from birth..      Im confused..       From what I know and from what I have seen foster care sucks.. for the parents and for the children..       Why would we put a child in foster care first THEN adoption when we could have them adopted right away..?  It is like saying to them.."nope, not sure we want you, might change our minds. we might adopt you later..:".. Like thats gonna make them feel REAL wanted..

There is an evilly possessed frog locked in my refrigerator!?	i woke up late at night to the sound of a hoarse voice in my ear saying: "I want a sammichhhhh", It scared me so i opened my eyes to see if anyone was there. there was a frog staring at me smiling at me deviously. I screamed and it woke up the gnome that lives next door. The gnome jumped nimbly up into my room through the window, and yelled at me. Then it saw the frog and ran away. So i used the cup on my bedside table that had water in it to trap him. So he was under the cup, and so i picked it up, ran to the kitchen, put him in my refrigerator, and slammed the door shut yelling "MAKE YOURSELF A SAMMICHHHH!!!!" Then I took a chain out of my bread box, wrapped it all the way around my fridge and locked it with a lock that was in my pocket.    WHAT DO I DO NOW?!? How do I get the frog out of my fridge? Does anybody know any good evil frog exterminators?   Thank you in advanced!

20090223005159AAtS3Ft	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Breastfeeding question?	My baby boy is almost 9 weeks old and I think he is going through a growth spurt. Since he was born he has had supplementary formula feeds due to him being quite large (birth weight 10 pound 4). He usually has one bottle per day in the evening. For the last couple of days he has been very unsettled and whingeing and crying most of the time and when I try to breastfeed him he latches on and then breaks off and cries over and over again. It is really stressing me out because he just seems to be getting very frustrated. I keep reading to continue to breastfeed him whenever he wants it but my problem is that he keeps spitting me out and fussing and crying and I feel sorry for him so today he has had two small bottles so far. I WANT my milk supply to increase to keep up with his demand but I also don't want to have a starving baby in the meantime. Is what I am doing ok?

20090222235858AAB7qmY	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Are parents getting soft?	Keep in mind that I am only 18 years old, but when I was a lot younger my parents would spank when necessary, ground me, take away things like television, video games, sleep overs and other privileges, depending on the severity of my offense. And that was pretty normal back then. I grew up to respect my parents for actually BEING parents and disciplining my sister and I as it was appropriate. But now I see a different kind of parenting, where kids basically run the house. I don't see a whole lot of discipline like I had growing up, but I do see a lot more ungrateful brats, spoiled children and kids who don't take their parents seriously like they should.       Have you noticed any trends like this? How do you feel about it?
20090223035550AAZkCL6	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	I'm 8 wks pregnant, really struggling with these symptoms, is it normal?

I feel sick all day long from getting up to going to bed (not actually been sick).  One minute I'll look at some food and thing 'oh I really fancy that' and then the next minute I can't bear it anywhere near me.  If I do eat something I fancy then 10 mins later it's like it doesn't agree and I feel even worse!  I also seem to be struggling with drinking, I am forcing myself to drink my water but it really is a struggle.  Has anyone else gone of drinking too?  I know this is needed so no matter what I'll drink plenty, but it's all such a nightmare!  I've been taking my vitamins since before I fell pregnant so thats all ok, but I'm just worrying why I'm going off everything, even drinking water and stuff.       I also had my booking appt last Thursday, how long will it be before I get my results, just want to know everythings ok.      Thanks.

There is enough education out there and in the end the state ends up paying for the baby in some way or another.  I think I have a solution but I am open to suggestions. I'm afraid the babies of  underage mothers should be taken from their care and put up for adoption, with couples who are infertile being put at the top of the list, saving them from the extortionate cost of IVF treatment.  We've tried education, that hasn't worked out to well and I can't think of another solution. Any other ideas anyone?

20090223030359AAP5qgg	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	9 month old still not sleeping through the night?	My 9 month old daughter has never really been a good sleeper during the day or at night. We do have a good routine at the moment. She naps twice a day, 1 in the morning around 9:30 and 1 in the afternoon around 2pm. Her naps vary from 30mins to 1hr 30mins.    Her nighttime routine is always the same, dinner around 5pm, bath and massage at 6pm, bottle at 6:30pm then bed at 7.    Last Saturday was the first night she slept right through since she was born and I finally thought I was getting somewhere. But now she's back to her old ways. She can wake several times in the night crying/babbling/rumbling around her cot. Usually I just give her a dummy and she falls back asleep but recently she's been waking around 4am for about 2 hours. I know it's not hunger as she's never really interested in her breakfast in the morning.   I'm not a fan of the "Cry it out" method, although as a last resort I tried it 2 nights ago, I left her crying for just over 2 minutes and she was sick all over her bed. So I will not be doing that again.   When I put her down for the night it can sometime take up to 20mins before she settles but she usually settles by herself, it's just staying sleeping that's the problem.   She has 3 small meals per day and is still on 4 7oz bottles per day.      Anybody else have this problem?   Any ideas on how I can get her to sleep right through the night?

I would liek to get lots of tips and advice for eating a healthy diet for the next 6 months or so, as im TTC. I went to see my GP - an di told him. He was like just go home and enjoy yourselves.    I said - but arent i supposed to take Folic acid, he says oh yeah take those as well.   I said what about my diet, he said eat more fruits. It was like i was forcing him to give me advice, and he was so abrupt. I felt like crying byt he time i left his office, it made me feel petty.      Do doctors normally do this?

20090223000831AAK1Tun	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Sleep changing again...?	We have a wonderful baby girl who is almost 10 months. She is wonderful at self settling and falls asleep on her own at 7 p.m every night.  She wakes each morning between 6 and 6:30 a.m.  about 50% of the time when she wakes she is happy and will talk to herself for a while until we go and get her up at around  7 the other half of the time she wakes up grizzly like she still wants to be asleep and the only way we have found to settle her is to breastfeed and then resettle and she will sleep for at least another hour.  If we try to get her up and postpone the feed until 7 she is upset for the rest of the day (thought she does not seem to need the feed once she is up and is happy to wait until 7 for a feed). I am not sure if I am being counter productive feeding her when I know she can quite happily go until 7 without a feed. We have tried putting her down half an hour later - but by 7 she is so tired and by 7:30 she is over tired and unable to settle herself. Any suggestions for the mornings she wakes upset?  Thank you

20090223041048AAQuL1w	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	MALE Abortion and financial responsibilities?	I am currently doing a research paper about Male Rights in Parenting. I am making an argument about how men does not have equal rights as women. I mean this statement is pretty obvious...      My question is whether the man still has complete responsibility if the pregnancy is a result of paternity fraud? What if the female lied about birth control? How can I man even successfully make such accusations in court? I mean it is obvious that he is going to lose...      In the case that the mother wants to be a single mother and does not care about having another man's child, as long as she has complete control, how dare she still take a man's money?      How are the payment determined? If a father works at a minimum wage job, does he pay the same price as for a father who earns $20 per hour?      Many argue that it is her body and her choice. What if the man wants the baby? Since both of them are responsible for having intercourse, why should everything always favor women? It is not men's fault that women are biologically made to give birth,      Please keep in mind that I do not want religious opinions because they have ruined enough lives.

20090223055307AAqW8do	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Periods after breast feeding?	I had my first post partum period last month.  Because I have been (and still am) breast feeding my daughter, I figured it was normal that I had my first post partum period about 8 months after she was born.  So I marked my calendar for when my next period was due this month.  My periods have always worked like clockwork and are very predictable.      Well.......... my period is now two days late this month and I KNOW I can't be pregnant.  I've take a test already (negative) and we've been using condoms (yes I know you can still get pregnant while using condoms, but the days of us having sex just don't match up for me to be pregnant).  So I'm 99% sure I'm not pregnant, but is there a reason why my period has not started yet?  Is it because I'm still breast feeding?  Did any of you moms have very regular periods before you started breast feeding and now they are all out of whack?

20090426162045AAhLrXR	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Gestational sac at 9 weeks measuring at 6 weeks and 3 days, can someone help me?	OK got pregnant on my 4 round of clomid and on      March 21, I got my positive HTP.      Lmp Feb 20      March 23, doctor told me that i was pregnant and to come back in two weeks for ultrasound.      April 9, ( 6 weeks and 6 days) did ultrasound a but all my doctor was only able to see was something that look like it would be a sac. So she did blood work (beta) to check my hcg levels.      April 10, blood work came back and was 4892, so that same day I had to go to see an ultrasound tech. When she did my ultrasound she saw a sac measuring at 5 weeks, when I should have been 7 weeks. So my doctor told my that it might be an ectopic pregnancy or a blight ovum ( now real sure on how to spell that). So she wanted me to come back in two weeks for another ultrasound.      April 24, went in for the other ultrasound and the only thing she could see was a sac and something that look like it would be the fetal pole.    And told me that I was now measuring at 6 weeks and 3 days. And now she want me to go in for another ultrasound next week to see if anything will change because, she say she see things like this with other females that go on to having a healthy pregnancy.       So my question is, should I not get my hopes up and just start looking to miscarriage or get an D&C very soon?      And I would love to here from other females who have had this problem and still had a happy ending, or females who were not so lucky and what happen?

20090223073054AAa1hPI	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Pros/Cons of using Prometrium after ovulation?	I started Clomid for the first time this cycle. Ovulated yesterday. My RE gave me a script for Prometrium (progesterone) and said it was up to me whether I wanted to take it after ovulation.      It seems like Prometrium could be useful given I have spotted before my full-flow period in the past and had a short luteal phase. At the same time, shouldn't Clomid fix this issue? Also, since I don't have a history of miscarriages (or pregnancy, for that matter), I wasn't sure what the benefit would be?       I also had concerns that Prometrium has a warning on the label about taking it when you are pregnant and it being a Pregnancy Category B drug?       Any advice, pros/cons, etc would be greatly appreciated.

20090223051631AAQpbug	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Chlorine-Free Diapers?	We had a baby shower for my SIL on Saturday and many of us got her Pampers Swaddlers in a variety of sizes.  One of the guests (my SIL's mother) bought her two packages of chlorine-free diapers ... I didn't catch the brand, if there was one.  I kid you not, when my SIL opened that gift, every other mom in the room (16 of us) was momentarily taken aback because none of us had ever heard of them before.        After the shower was over her mom, who must have felt that she owed us some sort of explanation, came over to me and was like, "Well, I saw that they said "chlorine-free" and I thought hey, that's great, but I don't know..."  and then she went into this big talk about how she used all-natural things for my SIL when she was a baby and she never fed her formula or store-bought baby food and she's so glad because Gerber was worried about the baby food it sold during the late 70s-early 80s and blah blah blah...  All the while I'm sitting there formula-feeding my seven-week-old Pampers-wearing daughter!      But I still don't get what the "chlorine-free" diapers mean.  Are they healthier for the baby?  Or are they better for the environment?  Does anyone know?

The is geared more towards the mommies of the group, but I welcome advice from the daddies side as well.      My cousin is pregnant with her first child and is going through all the usual "what the heck?" moments we all have had with regard to our bodies changing dramatically and all the unknowns about what's ahead. She and I have been very close most of our lives, so I feel somewhat compelled to give her all the advice I wish I had been given. I keep telling her (and myself) that every pregnancy, just like every child, is different. I keep reminding her that the stories she hears (both good & bad) may be very different from her own experiences. I also know that a lot of advice I can give her she will only truly understand when & if she goes through it herself.      That being said, I want to arm her all with knowledge I can. I guess I'm trying to compile my little Y!A version of the "Girlfriend's Guide to Pregnancy." So mommies (and daddies if you feel like it), here we go:      What is the one piece of invaluable information you would want to pass on to expectant moms in the following areas?      Pregnancy   Labor & Delivery   Postpartum/Recovery   The First Week Home      What do they NEED to know about each of those areas?
20090223074848AAp7rI3	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	What would you think about this?	Let me start off by saying that we never go anywhere or do anything because between our work hours and three kids well ya' know.     But Saturday night my husband cousin called and she said she was coming to town and asked if we wanted to do anything, we explained we had the kids but my usband said he would go buy like a 12 pack and they could just sit in garage and drink a little bit because the kids would all be in bed.  She asked if she could bring one of her friends and we said sure.   Well at about 8 pm my son (5) and I were sitting on the couch reading a book and the doorbell rang I said come in and my son says "TEACHER"  Ha!  Her 'friend' is my sons teacher.  The teacher immediatly looked really emabarresed and her and my husbands cousin and my hubby went to the garage (they came early)  So I guess my whole point to this is what you think if your sons pre k teacher showed up to your house to drink?

20090223051559AA67hAd	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Is pregnancy a possibility?	I've been taking the contraceptive pill since August 2007 and recently changed from Loestrin to Microgynon 30 in November. I started a new packet last monday after the 7 pill free days and I had taken it correctly. I had sex on Thursday with my boyfriend,we always use a condom as extra protection but this time the condom broke,without us realising until afterwards when he'd ejaculated.Should I be concerned about preganancy? I had taken the pill correctly that day and the days leading up to it and had no vomiting or diarrhea and had taken no other medication.
20090223055402AABAX1g	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	How long does your 6 month old sleep at night?	My baby is waking up 5-6 times from 10pm - 6am.  She wakes up and starts screaming and gets louder and louder until I get her and nurse her.  Sometimes she falls back asleep before she even eats, but if I put her back in the crib, she wakes back up and starts screaming again.  For her first four months, she slept in bed with me and we got even less sleep.  I thought maybe being in her own room would help, but it hasn't.  She is not my first baby, my other babies were only waking up 1-2 times through the night at this age.  In fact, my son was sleeping through the night at four months (once I put him in his own room).  I started her on solids and thought that might help her sleep a little longer... WRONG!!  I try keeping her up during the day, and feeding her often, but that's not working... then, to top it all off, I have a 2 and 3 year old to keep up with during the day!      My question is, what is your 6 month old baby's sleeping habits?
20090223051033AAkePoG	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Pregnancy: Amniotic fluid question?	My friend had a still birth on Saturday morning, she was 10days overdue and her amniotic fluid had dried up or whatever happens to it. I know your AF starts to disappear when you're overdue, but how do they know how at your appointments how much you have left. She had a membrane sweep on Friday night at the hospital then on the Sat morning she'd given birth, they told her that her daughter died on Friday at some point because there was no AF.      In the past month i've known 3 people to have stillbirths, 2 of them were due to AF and the other because she was carrying twins and was high risk, don't know the exact reasoning behind that though.      So how do they test how much fluid you've got when you're nearing your due date? I'm scared incase i go overdue and the same thing happens to me. It doesn't seem like a slight mistake to me if it's happened to 2 people i know in the past month.

So I posted an ad on craigslist like I have seen lots of other people in my area do. And someone emailed me telling me that there is a law about baby sitting that you can not baby sit more then 3 kids with out a license? I have never heard of this! And either way would my niece and nephews count towards that if im not getting paid for watching them? Also two of them are in school? I can see why the gov. wouldn't want you making a large amount off of it with out them getting some of it.. but that is just crazy. And yes im CPR trained and so on I went to school for Early Childhood Education and I worked in a daycare for 3 years. I thought of opening and in home daycare but decided it would not be worth all of the work since im planning on going back to school after the summer to become a social worker. Any ideas on this law?

I started BD from the last day of my period which was the 8th of February and we had sex every day and every other day randomly up till today (February 23). I noticed really thin stretchy cervical mucus on the 20th which I think was my ovulation day cause one day prior to the stretchy mucus I also had sharp pains in my left ovary for about 30 minutes on and off in other words needle like pains. I usually have 25-29 day menstrual cycles, so I expect my period anywhere from March 1 – 5. Today I started having mild cramps in my lower abdomen and feel bloated and a little nauseous. I usually have cramps one week before my AF but this time the cramps are mild. I know that these symptoms are sometimes exactly identical when talking about AF and pregnancy, but I just need to know if I really ovulated on the 20th was the stretchy mucus a sign? And how soon should I take a HPT???

I also felt nauseated and felt like my face was very warm, but the rest of my body had chills. I appreciate all of the answers. My hubby and I are ttc # 2 for 2 years and after a miscarriage.      We had sex on the 12th, 14th, 16th(but didn't finish), 20th.   The more I read I find out new things. My question is could I have ovulated on Sun, and the pain I had Sun been implantation cramps? I went and bought a $1.00 hpt because I figured it was way too early to get a + hpt, and took it this morning. It looks like there is a line where the + would be. It is so faint. If this is true, I would be 8 dpo. What do you all think.

20090223072825AAjdM1e	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	I Need Help.. Could I Be Pregnant?!?	Hey guys! I am 18 [19 in August] and scared to death. You see me and my boyfriend have been together for 2+ yrs now. I have never been on birth control and we rarely use condoms. My period was usually irregular until about July of last year. Since then it comes at the end of the month usually in the morning when i wake up and stays for 4 days. Around new years we had unprotected sex but he said he pulled out. I didn't think anything of it until one week before my period was supposed to come i started getting headaches off and on, urinating more frequently, major mood swings, increased hunger but no increased bowl movements, some back pain but not too much, i became very very tired, my temp went up, and my areolas got darker and bigger. This went on for about a week and a half and i had already missed my period. I took a hpt and came up negative. I went to a clinic February 3rd and took a test and still a negative. So now I'm still urinating frequently, my lower back sometimes hurt [but only when i lay on my side and sometimes when i walk], i am still not having bowl movements regularly, my hunger is fine but i have cravings for pickles, headaches don't come everyday but i still have them, i am still moody, i am still very tired, my temp stay'd up for a while then went down but now it is back up. I took a test this morning when i woke up and it is still negative. I have talked to my boyfriend and whether i am or not he loves me and nothing is going to change. But I don't know what to do. I am going to try and make a doctors appointment but i don't want to tell my mom and I am still on her insurance. Any advice/help would really benefit me and my boyfriend right now.

I have been doing exercises on the ball and on my hands and knees to encourage the baby to turn, but it has not worked.  He has been in the same position since 18 weeks.

Its this horrible high pitched scream, it sounds like someones hurting him or something, He does this constantly. He also will hit people in the face or if he's not around anyone he will just hit himself in the face or bite his own arm. He always screams, but he only hits when he is mad. My son gets so mad, so easily, like if I try to get him to talk and say real words, he hits, or if I won't let him have something he wants. I just don't know what to do because he is to young for time out, I tried putting him in his playpen for a minute but it did nothing. How do I control his horrible temper?

My daughter has been coughing and sneezing and spitting up her formula since we brought her home, now she has got worse, now she's moody and hardly ever eats, and has gas that I believe is bothering her so I bought some infant medicine from wal mart to try and help, when I gave it to her she seemed to calm down a little and feel okay, but when I was talking to my mother in law about it she got angry and told me I shouldn't give her any medicine she is fine... What should I do?

Hi Friends,      In the morning, we are giving 1 bottle of Pediasure (8 fl OZ) to our 2 yrs 3 months old daughter......as my wife is house wife, she take care her all the day at home, meaning, my daughter is not going to day care/pre-school.      My daughter daily activity is normal, she play as usual, normal routine.      But, we noticed that, she is taking less lunch ( we give her rice as lunch)........so, we r thinking that, may be the pediasure is becoming her as heavy, so, its long time to get digetion, so, she is taking less in quantity of lunch!!      So, pls. let us know that,      1) How many hours its required to get digest completely for my daughter, considering her activity, health all are normal?      2) Is really, pediasure is heeavy?      3) is pediasure causes constipition?      thanq

He is almost two years old. He has to be in a full body cast up to his waist and will have to lie down for almost the whole 6 weeks.

20090426135011AAyBAX2	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	2WW BABY DUST AND GOOD LUCK!!!!?	So my online calendar helped estimate when I would ovulate, I started BD early, lol couldnt hurt right? lol so I had some cramping right before I was, so I'm pretty sure I ovulated I didnt take an OPK though. So now I'm on my 2ww and I hope and pray this is our month.  We have gone over a year ttc and still no luck, but next cycle if this isn't my time, then I will invest in some OPKS, preseed, and things along those lines and try more and then if not we will go see a fertility doc.  I hope this is our month though because everything is perfect, we are moving closer to my fam and a much nicer place, I'm so tired of this old house! And we are completely stable financially so everything would just be great and if we concieve, it would be near my bday when the baby would be due! BEST PRESENT I COULD EVER GET! So keep your fingers crossed and im crossing mine for yall too! Thanks for all the encouraging words and advice from all my friends on here! STICKY STICKY BABY DUST TO ALL!!!!

20090223065037AA4oNO5	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	What does "cry-it-out" mean to you?	I know some people are strenuously opposed to all forms of cry-it-out and I have no problem with that.  I know that other people are fine with letting the baby cry themselves to sleep for a very long time.  I don't believe that experience is as harmful as some people do, but I also don't see how a baby would ever learn how to go to sleep using that method.      However, it seems like there's a lot of gray area between those two positions.  Here are two methods I have used with my son.       1)Slow footsteps.  Basically, not going in the instant they start crying.  If I'm awake, I'll pee, wash my hands, make a bottle, whatever.  If I'm in bed, I'll look at the clock or count to 100.  About 50 percent of the time my son will just go back to sleep.  In a few rare cases (like the time he got his legs caught in the crib rails) something in the way he's crying will tell me that I need to go in immediately.  Cry it out or not?      2)The "five minutes to think it over" method.  Usually for naps or at bedtime.  My son is clearly tired and fussy, but won't eat.  I put him down and he cries.  I pick him up and he stops crying, but continues to rub his eyes and fuss.  I'll put him down and let him cry for five minutes and then re-evaluate.  Sometimes he'll go to sleep.  Sometimes he won't sleep, but will stop crying, talk to himself and eventually sleep.  Sometimes he'll keep crying and I'll go back in, but he'll be much more amenable to eating and/or being comforted.       Are these methods "cry-it-out" to you, or not?  If you do allow some crying, where do you draw the line?      I'd say "I'm not trying to start a debate" but I think that would be a little pointless, lol, so let me have it!

20090223051308AAq2Tdq	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	It always irritates me when...?	People call pregnant women fat. Or pregnant women call themselves fat. This anorexic mentality in our society has gone too far when people consider a baby bump fat. You have another person inside you, you have the right to gain some weight and not have a flat stomach! If I ever get pregnant I was really looking forward to people cooing over my stomach and feeling proud of my big belly. Now I figure I will probably have to put up with people telling me to go on a diet becuase I am a fat cow. Ridiculous. What do you think?

20090223062208AAZC8tD	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	What are teens doing today?	For her final senior project my sister has to write a 20 page research paper of her choice. After graduating from the same school 2 years ago and getting an A on the project, she asked for some help. Thankfully I am extremely good at writing papers and arguing my point, but the topic she chose is something Im not all to familar with.       A year back, her childhood best friend, who apparently had some obssesion with losing weight,  ended up becoming very sick and as a result of this, her parents cut off all contact and my sister hasnt heard from since. She decided to do this project as a way to make people aware of how serious and common it is.       Although I know I can just pull up statistics and show some facts I was looking for something that hits home with young people. What are some drastic or unhealthy ways that young teens are using to lose weight? We are trying to get the point across with scary, but realistic information. Also if you have any personal stories as well. Thank you for all the help!

My question is:   1) Would there be any safety concerns of a crib that old?    2) If the mattress was wrapped up (plastic bag or something), would it still be OK to use?      If there are any concerns, our thought was to upgrade our son to a toddler bed/twin bed and give them our crib.

Every month now i think i ovulate later as my period are usually 3 or 4 days late. My last period was 21 JAN and so my next period should of come on the 18 FEB (28 days) but it came on the 22 FEB instead, do you think the reason my periods are always 3-4 days late is because i ovulate on CD 18 instead of CD14? could this happen? i know i definately ovulated this month because my CD 21/22 blood test showed this. I am just trying to work out my body and cycles because i have been trying to conceive for over a year me and my partner are eeing a gynae but i have just been thinking this may be the reason why i haven't  yet and if this is the case then Baby dance longer on in my cycle the usual.

20090223070015AAd3jRo	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Ttc and excited about it!!?	I feel REALLY good and excited about this month. I really think this month could be our month, even though we just started trying again last Wed =] The first day of my last pd was 16 days ago. And my cycles have been off since I stopped taking birth control back in Sept. to get pregnant. So they've never started on the day I think I am going to. Last months cycle was 37 days, and the month before was 32. So it's a tad bit frustrating when AF decides to show up =[ I always think I know when I'm ovulating because my CM gets really slick and there's a lot of it. I know sometimes, you can get CM confused with left-over sperm (gross, I know). I always notice it the next day. If I was to get an OPK, should I start using it now, or when should I? My husband and I decided to baby dance every other day for 3 wks, just to be on the safe side. Any advice??   Also, something that REALLY gave me hope for this month, I'm just really excited and feel good about it.. But a few days ago I went to PF Changs and this is what my fortune cookie said.. "A long-waited event will be with you soon." I don't believe in all that stuff, but geesh, if that doesn't give me hope I don't know what would!

20090223042525AAlufqD	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	I made a huge mistake whwat do I do?!?!?	Okay well first of all I'm on my friends account. Yeah... So back to my problem.   Two weekends ago I I went to one of my friends parties. I met this guy there (he's 16, I'm 15) and I live right down the road so he offered to walk me home so we walked home together. Nobody was at my house. He wanted to come in, so I let him in. We were just sitting there talking and he was like "wann have sex?" And I was like "NO!" Then he was like "Come on, one time won't hurt anything" Then I was like "Yes it will get outta my house!" Then he was like no and started making out with me. Then I made him stop and he was like "wanna have sex now?" I said "No get out of my house!" Yeah, the conversation went around like that till I was like "fine, only once though" I don't know why I did that! I'm so stupid! I mean I think that I was thinking I didn't want him to like rape me or something, so I just went ahead I don't know what I was thinking I'm so stupid! It only lasted like not even a minute though. Anyways, my problem is that I'm scared to tell my dad and I'm scared that I'm pregnant. I'm scared to tell my dad cause I usually would never do something like this! Like I'm a straight A student, I like almost never get in trouble! I'm scared he'll won't like me anymore. I'm scared that I'm pregnant cause I think the condom ripped and I'm 2 days late and I just now took a test this morning and it's positive so what the heck do I do now???

On my 32 week midwife appointment I measured 31cm and now at my 36 week midwife appointment today I measured 34cm.   My midwife didn't seem worried and told me that if I was 3cm under I would go for a scan.  How do all you measure up and will I have a small baby or a big baby?  Is this fundal measuring really a good thing to go by? My baby is very active and strong so I'm not really worried.

20090223054913AARZKVv	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Buying a test after work... but could this be?!?	I have been getting my period like clock work since November, having a 26 day cycle.   While on vacation for Valentine's Day, my fiance and I had intercourse on the 14th and 15th.   I was not expecting this to be a fertile period (although I don't know for sure my average luteal phase) but my period came a day late and it is NOT how it usually is.   When I wiped this morning it was just a small amount of diluted pink. I put a thin pad on and before I left checked to see if it got heavier, but all that was there was 3 small spots of brownish pink. I put a tampon in for fear that it would come on the way to work but when I changed it there was barely anything there. It was just brown, pink, small amount of red just at the tip. Ididn'tt put one back in but left the panty liner. I keep feeling like I am "leaking" but when I go to pee nothing is there.      My breasts have been sore but only really on the out side by my underarms. My fiance said they feel swollen too.      Do you think that I could be preggers??!! :)

Hiya,   so im 5 weeks late now. doctors are no help.   when i had my daughter pregnancy tests came up positive straight away.   i am 7 months pp.   so iv done around 10 tests altogether and im pretty sure i saw 3 lines 2 i defiantly did and another 2 tests were very light i could just about see them. so im not sure about these   results were coming out after 6 mins of taking the tests   but my tests now are coming back negative.   my doctor done a urine sample last week and sent it to the hospital which was negative.   today's test was also negative. i do use morning urine.   i haven't had any bleeding at all since december. and dont understand why tests would say positive.   and i would have thought that the later you are the more positives you get?   i dont take any medication. and cant think of a reason why they would do this.   not sure about pregnancy symptoms, with my daughter i had none at all, only that i was more hungry than usual, and im sure im like that now.   i dont understand why they would come out positive and then now they are negative?   any one had pregnancy tests doing this?   was you pregnant or not or do you know any one who's experienced this?   was something wrong with you?   any info helps, its so frustrating waiting around lol!   the order the tests have come out in:   faint, yes, no , faint, very very faint line but ill take it as a no, no   (these are all the morning tests)   Sorry i do long Q's i just want to include as much info as i can   Thank you x

Here is my story...      Im 35, never been pregnant...I have been trying for a couple yrs, unsuccessfully.      Im now seeing a fertility speacialist as my cycles have been all over the place, i dont ovulate reg. I had a HSG last yr, passed with flying colours ..whew...We have tested hubbys sperm, he is way above the norm, so he is not an issue either...so its all on my end.      Last cycle was on Femara, day 3-7...then took Ovidrel...followed by Prometrium..      Did the 2ww, nurse tested me on Feb 19..BFN!!!!!!!!!! So frustrating...I assumed just because i was given Ovidrel for sure id be preggers...      Anyhoo, here i am , just got my period on Sunday Feb 22, going back to Dr's on Day 3 for bloodwork and u/s..      Is there anyone who has been in this boat or who has taken the same meds and became successfully pregnant...            Hoping to hear from someone out there...      Thanks!      Natalie from Canada

20090223053544AA9YHug	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Check fallopian tubes & hysteroscopy?	Hi,       I'm married for nearly 2 years now but still can't get pregnant.  I'm 30 years old. Recently, I went to check with infertility doctor and she found 2 polyps in my uterus via transvaginal ultrasound.  What size should the polyp be to conclude that the doctor really needs to perform hysteroscopy to remove the polyps?  Hysteroscopy with anesthesia so painless right?  I'm very scared of pain...     The doctor also want to check on my fallopian tubes if blocked, causing me not getting pregnant.  She might put liquid inside to check if fallopian tubes are blocked or not.  Question:  if the doctor is sure to perform hysteroscopy on me, can she do the checking of fallopian tubes during hysteroscopy to make it painless as well?  Coz I heard checking fallopian tube via SIS is quite painful... so I hope to do the test while with anesthesia on hysteroscopy.      Any advice will greatly appreciated.  Thank you.

20090223065630AAWwtaF	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Am I pregnant or just getting my hopes up?!?!?	My partner and I are trying for a baby. My last period was on the 4th Feb, so we made sure we were having intercourse every day from the 14th. Its now the 23rd and I just want to know if Im pregnant. I was feeling ill the past few days, feelings in my tummy, a fever, feeling tired and sick, headache, pins and needles in my hands, runny nose. It actually got to the point where I went and saw a doctor, I explained about trying for a baby, and she asked me to do a pregnancy test, (22nd) which came back negative, she then said I had a urinary infection, so now Im thinking the signs I thought were pregnancy signs are because of the infection, however would the test come back positive or would it have been too early. I really want to be pregnant and know the only real way is to wait and do a test once Ive  missed my period but I just wondered if anyone else has gone through this or if these are signs of pregnancy so early on?!?!?! Please help…..

20090223071637AA6XDvI	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	My son had his 4 month shots last week?	He got his shots on Wednesday, and seemed pretty normal Thursday. Then on Friday he was inconsolable. He cried into the night and the only way I could get any sleep was to finally co-sleep. Then Saturday he was fussy all day. Just generally grumpy and crying and nothing made him happy. He had no fever, but was having diarrhea. Yesterday he seemed mostly better, but still more fussy than usual. Last night he finally slept quite well again. (Asleep by ten, woke at 3:30, then again at 6.) I am not worried at this point because he is eating well and seems to be better, I was just wondering, could this have been a reaction to the shots? It seems odd to me that he was fine Wednesday and Thursday, then started having problems Friday. My mom says it's from the shots, but my MIL said he was probably getting sick. Obviously, I will take him to the dr if he isn't better today, but I just thought I'd ask you folks what you think?

20090223070503AAscWxv	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	5 weeks pregnant... and scared to death...?	I just found out yesterday that I am pregnant.  I can't be more than 4 to 5 weeks along.  Problem is I've had 2 miscariages in the past... but I was much younger then.  I think both were right around 7 to 8 weeks but a couple years apart.  I called the doctor because I had read that they can sometimes give you pills or some type of meds to try to prevent miscarriage but my doctor I am just to wait and make an appt for my 8th week.  I feel good aboutthis one but my past still scres me.  Anyone know anything about these meds that help to prevent miscarriage?

So my periods are pretty regular I can usually pinpoint them to one or two specific dates each month. The past few months AF started on the 19th. My last period was 1-19-09. I started spotting on 2-2-09. My miscarriage was confirmed on 2-6-09. My bleeding from the miscarriage stopped about the 6th or 7th.    With all that being said when should I expect AF. I know some womens periods go right back on track and I guess some dont like me. What was your experience for those that had a miscarriage? Will I have to wait until March 19th to get a period or are they just gonna be all messed up?

20090223071611AA8KxuL	Pregnancy & Parenting;Baby Names	What's a good initial to go with this boys name?	Were naming our son Bartholomew.  We are having the hardest time coming up with a middle name and in previous post somebody had mentioned an initial, witch is looking like a great idea.        I'm worried that any middle name we pick out will be a mouth full with the last name being 7 letters long.  Also anything will be very long for a drivers license when the time comes.      We really like Bartholomew Mack, and Bartholomew Bryce.  BUT agian they still seem very long.      Good initials to go with Bartholomew.  NOT J ... because my son is not being named after a Simpson's character as much as people would like to think.      This name has a lot of meaning to my husband and I both.

My daughter will be 2yrs. old in beginning of March ('09) but she really isn't talking and this has me really concerned. She'll say: "bye-bye, momma & mommy, dada, hi, daisy (the name of our cat), teeth, cup, juice, i pee-pee, i poo-poo... and that's about all that she says clearly. From what I've been reading, she should have a 50-75 word + vocabulary, which worries me. I have an almost 4 year old, as well, who started talking very young. However, the thing is, my almost 2yr. old follows directions wonderfully and grasps everything I say to her. She LOVES to sing (or at least attempt to) and tries to sing the wheels on the bus song and twinkle, twinkle little star.  My mother-in-law keeps stressing that every child develops at his/her own rate. I just wanted to see if anyone on here has any thoughts about it. Is there any reason to freak out or should I just relax and see what happens?

20090223071144AAeG1SM	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Should my breasts be?	My husband and I had been trying for baby #2 for quite awhile now. I found out that I was pregnant for the second time about a month ago. My last period was 10 days late, it only lasted for 3 days, and was not much more than spotting. But, that was still the date that I was going by to calculate my due date. That would put me at approximately 7-8 weeks now.    Just the other day, I noticed that my breasts have already begun to produce colostrum. Has this happened to anyone else this early on? It didn't start happening with my daughter (who I also breastfed) until I was 6-7 months along.    The only other possibilities I can come up with is that I am a month further along than I originally thought.. or that this is happening due to a surge of hormones from multiples (which run very strong in my family). My doctor's appointment/ultrasound is March 6th.

My soon to be ex dropped the kids off at her house this morning and then she usually drives over here to get my 4-year old on the bus.  She claims that my older son locked up this morning so they couldn't get in to get a change of clothes for my little ones.  Problem is, I am home sick today!!  My car is right there in front of the house and the front and back doors were unlocked just in case I was sleeping when she got here.        So how would you handle her lying?  This is not the first time, at least I don't think.  Several times when the kids are dropped off to her by their dad, she has called to let me know that they are sick, running fevers, throwing up, miserable, etc.  But when I get home, they are just fine and my 4-year old insists that he did not throw up.
