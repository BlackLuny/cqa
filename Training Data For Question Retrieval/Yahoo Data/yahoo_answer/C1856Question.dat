20090225023518AAL7zhO	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Add-ons	Which Graphics card should i buy.. 9800Gt, 8800Gt, 9600Gt or an ATI 4850 ?	Hi.. I live in Zimbabwe and want to buy a new Graphics card..   There are not a lot of choices here in Zim.. actually you cant get any PCI - express cards here at all.. a friend of mine is going to South Africa and i want him to buy me one in the price range of one of the following cards :      Nvidia (Forsa or Asus EN)  - 9600Gt, 9800Gt and 8800Gt Or   ATI 8450 (Sapphire )      he is only going just past the border and the shops there dont stock Original nvidia or ATI only Clones Like Nvidia Forsa and ATi Saphhire or Original ASUS En series.. but from my past experience i have noticed The EN series of Asus cards to be of poor performance compared to The normal nvidia of the same series.. eg 8400GS.. maybe it was just the 2 cards i owned .. i dont know ?   Secondly the Forsa clones of Nvidia seem to perfome just as good as the original Nvidia cards.. if not better in some cases..            Down to my Question.. which card should i buy ??   I know the 9800Gt would be better than the 9600Gt..   But i read online that the 9800Gt is just a clone of the 8800Gt..   So should i buy the 8800Gt coz its cheaper ? or should i get the 9600Gt ? would it be better than the 8800 ??? in that case would it beat the 9800 since its supposedly a clone of the 8800 ?????   Im not an ATi fan but i read a few reviews that said the 8450 Smokes the Performance of all the Nvidias i mentioned but is cheaper ????   Does the ATI really performe as good as the Nvidias i mentioned... i fail to believe it based on past experience with ATi but im willing to give it a chance..      Please some one help me.. ive done a bit of reading on peoples reviews etc.. but none of them compare the cards i want to choose from.. so its hard for me to decide which to purchase...      I wont get another chance anytime within the next few months to get one again so i want to make the best choice :)

20090225030035AAKlSO3	Computers & Internet;Software	Is there a simple database/listing program with an instant filter?	Its a bit hard to explain but here goes   Does anyone know of a program that has any number of tabbed pages that are simply a set of columns and rows like ms excel but also has, on the sheet, a box that If you type in the box; as soon as you enter a character your list is filtered so only items containing what you type remain visible. ie if you type a b then instantly only items containing the letter b can be seen then you type an i and only items containing bi remain visible then an l and only items containing bil remain visible. I ask because I have a program called EssentialPIM  that has a to do list that does exactly that and I find it so much more pleasing than the auto filter in my version of excel. The only problem is  EssentialPIM is a diary and has only one to do page / list and I would like a program that is a book of pages that are identical to  EssentialPIMs to do page.   The other thing that occurs to me is can excel be programmed to do this?

20090225043558AAnLFwP	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Desktops	Intel C2D/C2Q "Intel Inside" Stickers?	OK, this may sound stupid, but I am having a big problem with these stickers.      I built a Shuttle computer for a friend's kid, with a nice E8600 CPU, BUT...I forgot to put the C2D sticker on the case for him. The kid is not driving me crazy getting him one. I put the EVGA and sound card stickers on, but the CPU (full box, not OEM) did not come with the usual sticker attached. I hear that Intel guards these little gems like nuclear secrets.      Anyway, does anyone know where I can get one of these for his case? I mean, before I actually peel one off of one of my builds and tell him where to "stick" it? :-)      Thanks...and sorry for the stupid question.

After this, I choose to open the file, and it is saved to be watched on itunes. Then, itunes opens, but no video is shown. I even tried to watch it with other software such as real player 11, or even youtube downloader, but it keeps opening as an itunes file. What can I do?

20090225061135AAY0h8o	Computers & Internet;Other - Computers	Under what circumstances would action be taken to trace an IP address?	Ok,   My girlfriends ex posted an add on Gumtree saying she was looking for sex.  She still had his sign on details from when they were together so she went in and deleted it.  She got carried away and changed the email and password so he couldn't get in.      So here's my question.  She is in a totally different country to the country of Gumtree's jurisdiction.      So I know that they would have recorded her IP.     My question is, how easily would they really be able to trace her IP back to her?  Also what is the likelihood that any real action would come of it?   I know that to get your details from the ISP they would need a court order.  Would a court bother in this case?      Basically, does she need to worry about any repercussions.

20090225064239AASkrpl	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	Windows Media Player Overloads Notebook HDD On Audio File Playback?	Ok so here's the deal, i have Asus Z99 notebook and whenever i start listening music on my WMP my HDD light lights up and never goes off also sometimes when i change the volume up or down my wmp also gets stuck on some track moment like old scratched audio cd on a cheap music player that the only way to stop that i have too hold my power button until my notebook turns off. Same thing hapens on winamp whenever i set the volume to max. It's weird because this only happens when i listen music through notebook speakers whenever i have my headphones or my amp plugged in this never happens. What could be the glitch that causes this?

20090224165015AACDD3o	Computers & Internet;Other - Computers	Where did my HDD space go?	I'm running a Vista PC with 2 320 GB (aka 298 actual GB) HDDs. The first drive contains the operating system as well as most files that the computer uses on a day-to-day basis. The second drive serves mostly as a backup to the first and has few other files.      My primary drive has been running close to its maximum for a while now so I went in to do some cleanup. The Windows.old folder is gone, most of the TV recordings I made are gone, and now, when I check the drive's properties it tells me I have only 134 GB worth of stuff on the drive.      This would be great if the sum of my folders was 134 GB, but it's not. After unhiding everything, the sum total of all files and folders on my drive seems to be 94 GB. So where could my missing 40 GB be?

I live in a student housing apt where we have ethernet outlets in our rooms. I am not able to get my cord to work with my laptop.

NOTE* Please do not answer "Press the Insert Key" because that is not the problem. Please try it yourself.      Open Word, Write a sentence. Highlight half of the sentence then press space. What should happen is that a space is inserted over the highted text.       What is happening for me now is that a space is being inserted and the text stays there. It is a pa   in for editing reports      Anyone know how to fix this.        Cheers!

20090225041834AAi3jkP	Computers & Internet;Internet;Other - Internet	How do I stop a scam through paypal?	I just bought something online from a website... realizing that it was a scam afterwards by not having a confirmation email, and that upon running a google search, I found many people reporting it as a fraud website. I immediately went onto Paypal to try and cancel my transaction, but apparently it isn't possible. The payment was not from Paypal funds, but from a bank account (debit card not credit card) and was made around one hour ago. Both statuses are still "uncleared".      I quickly went to change my bank address details, so that Paypal might not even get the money. Will this work? Or is it too late? What other options do I have. Many thanks.

20090225072522AAkwbkk	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Desktops	Problem with computer overclocking?	I have a ECS A780GM-A black series motherboard and an AMD Phenom 2 X3 720 Black Edition processor. I have overclock these from the stock 2.8 GHz by raising the FSB from 200 to 210 and the CPU multiplier from 14 to 14.5 to get an overclock of about 3.0 GHz. While in Windows, this is a stable overclock that has passed Prime95. But when i shut down the machine, it will not boot back into windows. It will, however, boot back into Windows if i just restart the machine. I have to reset the CMOS jumper in order for it to boot back up from shutdown. I know this is not much of an overclock, but this is my first time overclocking and I still have a stock heat sink and fan. Is there anything i can do to fix this? Thanks in advance for your help.

I have 2 laptop ram (1gb each).   usually my  computer is smooth as ice.      but i notice today that the speed is now super slow.   ok see, this is what happened.   i put my computer to sleep mode yesterday before i went to bed.   then i switch off the power directly from the power point.      i'm sure this is bad for the comp, i should have wake it up from sleepmode then use the proper "shut down" before i switch off power point.      anyway, i'm sure something went bad. and now my comp is much slower.      i check the task manager performance,   and after opening many softwares, only 1GB of memory is being used.      but it still says i have total of 2GB ram.       but it just want use over 1 GB ram no matter what i do now!      thats why i suspect 1 of my RAM is faulty now, due to switching off my laptop during sleepmode.      SO THE MAIN QUESTION IS. how can i check if my ram is working?   or it could be my graphic card ram at fault?      i'm running Vista home basic, and this is the 1st major problem i encounter in 2 years.

20090202101934AAwz8pF	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	Which laptop would you reccomend for me?	I'm looking for a laptop... but am having such difficulty picking which one to buy because im not familiar with the terminology used to describe what the laptop has... so firstly can anyone tell me what is RAM n GHz? and what difference does it make to the laptop?        I also want the laptop for many different things, hence why I am so undecided between which one I want to buy. I like listening to music and watching films on my current laptop, but have actually run out of memory.  So I need a laptop with a very large memory capacity.   I will also need the laptop for doing university work so a good word processor and power point etc is needed, which is swaying me away from a Mac as they seem to be hard to use although they are very appealing for me.    I am also unsure between getting windows XP or Windows Vista [chances are I wont get a mac]. I'm used to windows XP, is there a great difference between it and Vista?    All opinions welcome =].    O and I don't really want to spend more than 1000.

20090202090604AAPXRub	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	Can having something plugged into a USB port on my laptop use more charge?	I have one of those fan things under my lap top to help keep it cool and it is connected using a USB port.  I seems that when the fan is on that my laptop loses charge much faster than when it is off.  I mean it is plugged on all the time, but I don't turn it on all the time so is it just my imagination or could it be losing charge faster?

20090202093353AAx44iS	Computers & Internet;Internet;Other - Internet	My computer keeps crashing using IE or Firefox!?	I purchased a brand new relatively well quipped laptop 3 days ago. From day one, right out of the box (with no downloads or tweaks) I experienced IE 7.0 crashing every 5-10 minutes; sometimes where it would recover from and sometimes where it would completely shut down. After I lost my patience I posted a question on answers and people seemed to agree I should try Firefox, so I downloaded and began using 3.0.5 only to experience crashing in Firefox as well that was equally as disruptive as IE. I am really at my wits end because I mostly use the computer for internet browsing. I am also very unhappy with the restart time which is two minutes and sixteen seconds (I actually timed it) which seems crazy for a Core 2 Duo processor with 4 gig of ram. Is this a vista thing? I believe I have ruled out IE 7.0 by replicating the same problem with Firefox.

20090225053605AAJlRdW	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Add-ons	Should i upgrade to this graphics card? Please read on!?	Ok so about 3-4 years ago i had a friend build the computer i am using today. Well back then i wasn't into gaming much but now i am. So about a couple of weeks back i put 2gb of ram and a geforce 6800 gt into my computer. Then after having that for only a couple of days i wanted something better (lol). But as i was talking to the guy that built our computer he said that putting an even better graphics card into our AGP slot will most likely make our 3-4yr. old motherboard croak. So this is my question, i wanted to put a geforce 6800 ultra (yea i know not a big ugrade but i'm afraid my motherboard is going to die on me if i put something better) would that be to much? Here's my computer specs      Windows XP Professional SP3   Intel Celeron 2.53ghz   2.00 gb or RAM   AGP slot only   Cerial Number for motheboard: MS6728 VER 2   400 watt power supply   And please don't tell me to get a new computer, i already know i should but i don't have the money right now. I was planing on selling my GT and getting the UTRA. So again do you think putting this card into my motherboard be to much? Is my power supply sufficient? Thanks a million in advance for your answers!

20090225045038AA98xj9	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	So with today's laptops with dual-core processors, how do you find out how fast they are in gigahertz?	5 years ago, gigahertz was a popular term when buying a new pc.  It showed how fast the processor was.  Nowadays, you don't ever hear about gigahertz when buying a new pc.  So, how do we find out how fast they are, then?  If it's a dual-core processor, isn't that better than a single-core processor?  By how much is it faster?  A lot, or a little?        I want a speedy laptop.  Which would be a good one to buy?  I want it to be the equivalent to 3+ gigahertz.        thanks for any help you can give me.

I dropped it 2 days after I got it (boy was I mad when hp wanted to charge $700 to fix it!) anyway, I refused to pay to have it repaired at the exorbitant rates they wanted, so I treated it like it could break any second. Its lasted me about a year.      In short, it wont POST. The power lights come on, the fan spins up, the hard drive clicks a little, then it just sits there in a sort of semi-on state.       I think its gone, but I was wondering if I could try resetting the bios to factory settings to at least get it to POST.

I have tried both the built-in microphone and I tried plugging in my own microphone into the 1/8" audio input. In all of these instances, whenever I play it back the sound wavers in and out.      I have an HP G60-120US notebook with Windows Vista 32-bit OS, 3GB RAM, and an AMD Turion Dual-Core RM-70 2GHz processor.

20090225064139AAgFkP6	Computers & Internet;Internet;Other - Internet	Internet Prices in South-Africa - Bloody Ridiculous?	ok, so I'm married to a south-african girl, I'm from Romania...We've been living here for a while and we were thinking of spending a few months in ZA, so I thought to look for some internet pricing, as we both use the internet regularly.      Now let me tell you how things are here in Romania: I pay about 30RON, which is equivalent to 90ZAR for my internet connection (monthly). For that, i get unlimited internet, no upload/download cap and the speeds are good (2-8 Mbps on outside lines, when I download stuff from torrent sites, where most peers are in N.America/EU/Asia and 5-20 Mbps for local traffic, within Romania)      Obviously , I had a hunch that things might be a bit more expensive, seeing that South-Africa is at the tip of Africa...but then again, in many aspects SA is more developed than Romania.      When I looked for prices, I was simply amazed at those rip-off figures...Over 1200 ZAR/monthly for a connection weaker than what I've got now AND, most importantly, 12GB monthly cap.....I normally exceed that figure in ONE day.      What is wrong in South-Africa ? Who makes these rip-off prices ?? I've lived in USA and UK as well and I've found the internet to be a bit more than Romania, but not nearly as much as in South-Africa. It is an OUTRAGE !!      How do you people that live there manage ? what do you use ? maybe you've got some knowledge of companies with a more reasonable service. I'm interested in UNLIMITED traffic...is there no company that offers , to say at least 2-4 Mbps speeds, but NO monthly cap ??

In the video you see her and her boyfriend stealing from a convenience store, selling their bodies, and buying and doing drugs. At the end of the video, the girl stumbles around, apparently bleeding in a train station as her boyfriend is laying passed out in the bathroom. She dies from an overdose after being taken to the hospital.      Can anyone find the name of the video please?

20090203144703AAHurcw	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	Bad laptop problem.Please help!Plz Leave detail.?	Well extremely long story short, I got a Acer 3680 laptop for christmas. My sister stepped on the screen a week After I got it. Then the crack on the screen progresed to an entire half with lines kinda like the off air sign only to completely cover the screen with off air lines, cracks and ink. So my screen is gone. but my real issue is with the admin password. See i am using a old clunky white monitor as my screen and it turns off when i go onto anything but the safe modes or command prompt. I do know how to fix it but i need to go on my admin, but i forgot my password. I have a normal account but it is very limited i can't download anything, Change any settings that would help in any way or any account settings.. I think i might wan't to just reinstall windows if possible to get the password to be deleted. If that would work it would be worth it. But i would try all other ways first.         --------------***PLEASE READ BEFORE ANSWERING!***------------------      Remember:      1. I have no way to go on my administrators account.      2. I can't change "ANY" settings.      3. It is a Acer 3680 laptop with windows vista home basic.      4. I can only work on the safe modes and command prompt.      5. I can go on to the internet.      6. I have tried to change my password with command prompt i need to be on my admin account while doing it or access is denied.      7. My warante is over.      8. I am pretty sure that i need my password to load a CD or DVD in the drive.       Please help, It has been like this for over a year and a half, Since a week after i got it for christmas. Thank you for any help and for your time. Will award best answer.

I notced that under the section "Deposit via PayPal" it says that a $2,000 deposit is required at the end of the auction.       So, is the $2,000 his reserve or is the $2,000 deposit in addition to the winning bid? If the latter is true and the winning bid is $1,000.
