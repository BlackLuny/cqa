20090223114833AAuLyiO	Sports;Other - Sports	Do girl's really have stronger legs than guys? If so, Why aren't women winning all the competitive events?	I've heard many women and men say that women have stronger legs than men even though women have longer and much more slender legs.  What troubles me about girls having stronger legs is that if it's true, shouldn't we be winning all the track events like 100meter sprint, high jump, long jump, weight lifting, etc? I know women excel in ultra marathons (which I've ran.. longest I've done is 100 miles0) but that's becasue women carry more fat and can metabolize fat throughout the grueling ordeal.      More Info: My boy friend and I have been working out regularly. I have always been an avid triathelete and my boy friend has played football in high school and participates in league games. My BF can't keep up the pace with me on my long distance cardio workouts so we've been hitting the weights for the time being. As we spotted each other with squats, we've noticed that I can squat a signifigant amount more than my BF. I can roughly max at 450lbs while my BF can only max out at around 280lbs. I dismissed it off hand but I think my BF is really a little hurt inside. Some have suggested that he's letting me win, but we're not competing and I know better. Plus, I had not known but I have been told that most men don't break 300 lbs max when doing squats. Why are my legs so much stronger than my boy friends especially whn my legs are much longer and thinner than his.      Also, my BF out weighs me by over 100lbs. I'm 5'11" and about 135lbs. My BF is about 6'1" and 250lbs. I have really long and skinny legs (but they are super fit, extremely toned, and rock hard) that fit into size 1 extra long jeans while my BF have these huge legs (compared to me anyhow). My inseam is about 36" and my BF is about 32". By all accounts, the extra length and lack of leverage should make squats harder for me to do. I really just don't get it. I try not to bring it up with my BF because I really love him and don't want him to feel inadequite. For now, we just work on upper body which he easily out classes me.       Oh before you ask, as an amiture triathelete, I usually run about 30 miles, bike 120 miles and swim 5 miles in my longer events. I don't hit the weights very much, but when I do, i love to work on my core abs (i love my little 4 pack) and legs (leg press, squats, lunges, and standing high jumps.  As a victim of fashion, I do like to wear very high heels 5 to 5.5 inches at times and the leg work outs really help. Many girls complain of turned ankles in high heels, but I can work, run, and dance in really high heels all day and night long. Does any of this make a difference?

Chiva fan or Not, your still going to read this but, with the lack of goals and attack in the past games, finally we get good news. Omar Arellano is finally back with the team to at least to practice. He aint 100% but is expected to apear in the bench for la jornada 8 at least.      news:   "Luego de casi dos meses de rehabilitación por una fractura en el quinto metatarsiano del pie izquierdo, el delantero del chiverío Omar Arellano por fin se pudo integrar al cien por ciento con el resto del plantel que se prepara para encarar el duelo ante el Everton de Chile dentro de la Copa Libertadores 2009, sin embargo no saldría a la banca el miércoles, debido a que se encuentra fuera de ritmo."      Well my question is, when he is back should Carlos Ochoa be benched and just play with Medina and Arellano up front? Or play with Arellano, Ochoa, and Medina? OR I would prefer Arellano, Borguetti, and Medina up front? or Neither Borguetti or Ochoa, but Arellano, Chicharito, and Medina?      In my opinion I think Chivas should play with a 3-4-3 formation, keep Arellano & Medina up front and just stick in there Chicharito, Ochoa, or Borguetti....      Opinions? what you think?

20090223104827AA5aufb	Sports;Basketball	The Celtics are good without Kevin Garnett, these are the reasons I think, do you agree?	Kevin Garnett has been injured and will miss 2 to 3 weeks on the Injured list. The Celtics have been 4-0 since he was benched due to his injury. O.K. now here are the reasons and do you agree with this statement. When Kevin Garnett is not in the game he frees up space for the guards Rajon Rondo and Ray Allen to drive to the basket. Also, Ray Allen gets the ball more and scores more along with Rajon Rondo, so basically they get more shot attempts. Also, I notice when the big man (K.G.) is on the floor he holds the ball for a while, taking more time off the shot clock on each possesion. When they play without K.G. they get their buckets quick from their scoring threats. One or two passes...bucket! With K.G. on the floor...maybe like 4 or 5 passes and then...bucket! However, always usually a bucket but with more time of the shot clock. Damn! I should be a NBA sports analyst. I've been after all watching NBA since Dr.J was in the ABA. LOL Anyway, do you agree that's the reason why the Celtics are winning still without Kevin Garnett? They're 5-0 without him now after last night's win over the Suns.
20090223105544AAAaYxd	Sports;Basketball	Why come Ray Allen can't go to the basket like Dwayne Wade does?	I know that a lot of people will say that's not his game. I don't know about that. Ray Allen can drive, I remember when he did it all the time with the Milwaukee Bucks and Seattle Sonics. He shoots a lot of jumpers, now if you add all those 3 pointers he shoots, along with the already high free throw average he has for the little amount of times he goes to the stripe. He has half the amount of free throw attempts per game as Lebron James and Kobe Bryant. I remember one year when Ray Allen averaged almost 25 a game. He would be right up there with James and Bryant. He can score a lot of points easily, maybe the Coach just doesn't want him driving because it messes up Coach Doc Rivers playbook and his plays. However, I say if you can do it, then do it. I always seen Ray Allen as the player who had the potential to play just like Michael Jordan, he's got the prettiest jumper and it's legit from outside, he can drive when he wants to. He needs to work more on defense. However, Dwayne Wade is never afraid to go to the basket, him nor Allen Iverson. Do you think Ray Allen is just scared to drive to the hoop?
20090223113549AA6bhcI	Sports;Hockey	Where are all the REAL Toronto Maple Leafs fans?	The reason I ask this question is because lately I have seen a lot of questions asking   a) If Toronto can still make the playoffs   b) Why are the Leafs so bad      If a fan is a REAL fan, they would know the following   a) That Cliff Fletcher said that this team will not contend for a playoff spot   b) That Brian Burke said that he had no intentions of trading to MAKE the playoffs this year   c) That both the above statements have been repeated many times in the media in the past year by both individuals?      Do the fans on Yahoo Answers NOT read or listen to the media?  Do they choose to ignore what the people who run the team say?      It's one thing for fans of the Penguins/Rangers/Stars/Canadiens/Senator... to ask this question because their GMs all felt a Stanley Cup was possible, but the Leafs management has been adamant since JFJ was fired that they would get worst before they would get better..............and they've been true to their word.      Anybody care to enlighten me where the REAL Toronto Maple Leafs fans are?

20090223115159AAHiOqo	Sports;Basketball	Is this 2010 free agent story the most overhyped thing ever?	Theres still a 1 year and 1/2 left of NBA Basketball and all that you hear are talks about July 2010. Does the media really have nothing to talk about so much that they have to talk about 2010? Its 2 years away and players cant sign extensions until this summer, we can speculate for another 1/2 year to 1 year 1/2 and we will not get an answer. I wouldnt be surprised if alot of these players signed extensions this summer or before the 2010 offseason even happens. What would make people definately think Lebron is going to the Knicks. I doubt these players are thinking about 2010, they're probably worried about what they have to do this season. Its ridiculous that teams are completely dismantling themselves in hopes for a pipedream. Is this 2010 thing over-hyped and talked about way too often?

The idea is a cartridge with no powder (there would still be primer), and with pure water in the case instead.  When the primer is ignited, it would instantly vaporize all of the water into high pressure steam to propel the round.      A given amount steam at standard temperature and pressure occupies 1600 times the volume of that much water.  It would be even more because of all the heat.  Does this sound interesting, feasible?

However, I feel that my 10 yard dash is above average for a beginer, my 20 yard dash is OKAY, but my 40 is horrific!      10 yard: 1.8-1.84 on average. Hand timed using a video camera. Stop/pause/replays!!      20 yard dash: 3.18-3.3      40 yard: 5.78-5.92      100 meter/109 yard: I won't even say, because my legs die out at about 60-80 yards, I'm basically going at a fast JOG after that.      Why is that?!?!?      My hypothesis is that my fast twitch muscles are pretty good, but it is my legs/my "power" muscles that too darn weak. My remedy is to do some squats, but I always hear from these "hardcore" fast twitch advocators that doing so won't do anything, or worse yet, make you SLOWER!! BUT, would if I did LIGHT weight and more reps.      Will this work?      If so, as my 10 yard may indicate, am I much faster than my 40 time??      PLEASE help, I'm going to join a gym TODAY!!!

I cant force it on that will just mess the axle up more. I heard you can go to a skate shop to fix that. My local skate shop is small and they wont do it. However, they do have an axle re-threader for 16.99 or i could get a new Element truck for 19.99. The other skate shops are about 45 min away and mom wont drive me there. Is there a way i can fix this without buying anything? If not, should i get a new truck or buy the axle re-threader. thanks.

20090223124912AAmTApx	Sports;Football (Soccer);2006 FIFA World Cup(TM)	Why do people complain about….?	about a team they face playing defensively?      It baffles me for two reasons:      1) A team has to be able to adapt to the opponent with WHATEVER formation, tactic or gameplan necessary to enable them to get the best possible result from the fixture. Even if it's a game between two big European giants, I do not see the problem. If ManU deem their strenght to be on their fast counter-attack or from set-pieces, whilst Inter have a formidable solid attacking formation, wouldn't it be stupid for SAF to play an open game, allowing Inter to run them riot with no chance of a counter-attack from ManU or without hardly being able to get out of their half to concede set-pieces? (just an example)      2) I find it weird when people complain of so against SMALL teams. If AC Milan plays Reggina, Reggina is AGAIN going to rather want to walk away from the San Siro with a point after playing with 10 men behind the goal and a lone striker than to leave their formation open for a technically superior AC Milan to rip them apart with skill and goals. If they then get a goal on a counter-attack or one off move or a set-piece then so be it. They walk away with the points.      Sorry but Sorry but a team, imo, does whatever it needs to do to walk away with the points/win/best possible result, etc. If that means a defensive formation/game plan to adapt to a stronger or different styled team I find that a SKILL rather than something to criticize.      And that's all for my LENGHTY thoughts of the day. Yes I know if you're from the other team it's frustrating, but complaining about it seems stupid. Do you agree or disagree?

20090223130427AAPrpDt	Sports;Wrestling	I think now is a Good time to ask this as we approach WrestleMania. Details inside What are your thoughts?	This is a little Survey I do every now and then, the last time I asked was just before Armageddon, so when answering the Questions please think from that time up untill now.      I have rephrased and changed some questions to how I normally ask it.   I normally aim it around WWE as I do not get to watch TNA very often, but you can answer for TNA as well if you like.      Which Superstar has impressed you most recently?      Which Diva has impressed you most recently?      Which Superstar have you been most Disapointed with?      Which Diva have you been most Dissapointed with recently?      Which Superstar and Diva do you think deserve a Push?   (This can mean anything from being pushed into Title Contention or a Good Rivalry)      Which Superstar and Diva needs to take a bit of timeout from The Limelight?   ( This can mean anything from always being involved in Title Matches or constantly involved with something which someone else could have been used for)      If you could change any Champion who would it be?   (This can be for any Title, plus who would you like to have in their Place?)      Which 2 Superstars or Diva's would you like to see involved in a Feud with each Other?         Here are my Opinions      Shelton Benjamin has impressed me most recently, I never really was a fan of his, but after his matches with The Undertaker before The Rumble he impressed me and I enjoyed watching even to he lost.      Melina has impressed me most with The Diva's, I think she made a good return and has done rather well in the ring since.      JBL just has not done it for me, this is mainly due to his Storyline. I dont think it done either him or HBK any favours, plus JBL just looked like he could not really do anything match wise without HBK getting the wins for him, just did not look that great in my opinion.      Maryse, OK it's not really her thought, but she'd just won The Diva's Title and was out injured, but she could have maybe made a few more appearances just so we did not forget that There was a Diva's Title, but even on her return I did not think she was as impressive as much as she had been improving before.      Again I think Shelton deserves a bigger Push, I would like to see him win The Money In The Bank Match at WrestleMania and see if he can work his way to maybe The WWE Title.      For me I think Edge needs to take a break from having a Title 75 % of the time he is in action. Yes he is entertaining in the way that you never know whats gonna happen next and he has cut some good promo's, but for the 15 months when he is around he has a Title around his waist. I think maybe its time for him to step down from it for a bit and just have some feuds with others without involving The Title, there is plently I think he can do.      The Title I would change is The ECW Title going to Finlay. I dont have a problem with Swagger, but I just think its time to give Finlay The Title which he deserves, I know we don't all classify The ECW Title as a World Title, but it still is and if it is The Only World Title Reign Finlay has in his Career it will do as it is better than him having none.      Rivalry I would like to see would be Umaga Vs Vldamir Kozlov, I just think it would be different and a good battle for both.      These are my opinions, I would like to know yours and get as many as possible, so if you think it is a good or interesting Question please Star as others my notice it later. I'm not trying to get cheap Stars just want lots of answers, so only Star if you think it is worth while.      Thanks

Renney is the sixth NHL coach let go this season, which includes all four coaches whose teams started the regular season in Europe."      Think it's a coincidence that 4/6 of the coaches fired worked for teams that started in Europe?  Or is Europe really bad luck, a bad omen, or whatever?  Or does the NHL just predict which teams will underachieve really well?

Ok now I know some of these guys were injury plaiged but I believe they will all have a great season, except 4 Maddux of course      They let go of:      -Derek Lowe: The dodgers never even offered him a contract, we would be a sick pitching staff with him around this year thats 4 sure. I bet he would even be in the race for the NL CY young because he would now have run support      -Brad Penny: I know he was injured but if he was healthy then he would be an extremely good asset to the dodgers, he could even be a reliever if he wasnt 100%.      -Greg Maddux- Im surprised Colleti didnt try to talk him out of retirement, he still had some good stuff and he could give you 5 or 6 good innings.       Takashi Saito: Ok I know his saves were down from a year ago and even his ERA but I would much rather have him than Broxton (at least for this season) agreed? (remember he was the one who gave up that mammoth home run against the Phils)      So there you have it, Im surprised the dodgers didnt really try to get some pitching this off season, Im thinking they should go after Ben Sheets when he comes back from elbow surgery, he always only lasts half or 3/4 or the season so might as well be for the last part of the season, hopefully he doesnt pull a Schmidt on us though lol.

I have suspected for some time now that my wife has been cheating on me. The usual signs; phone rings but if I answer, the caller hangs up. My wife has been going out with 'the girls' a lot recently although when I ask their names she always says, "just some friends from work, you don't know them." I try to stay awake and look out for her when she comes home, but I usually fall asleep. Anyway, I have never broached the subject with my wife. I think deep down I just did not want to know the truth, but last night she went out again and I decided to finally check on her. Around midnight, I hid in the garage behind my golf clubs so I could get a good view of the whole street when she arrived home from a night out with 'the girls.' When she got out of the car she was buttoning up her blouse, which was open, and she took her knickers out of her purse and slipped them on. It was at that moment, crouching behind my golf clubs, that I noticed a hairline crack where the grip meets the graphite shaft on my 3-wood.  Is this something I can fix myself or should I take it back to the pro-shop where I bought it?    Brian

Do you agree/disagree? Why or why not?

20090223130313AA80mRr	Sports;Wrestling	What do you think of the current plans for WM 25? BQ inside?	I personally think they're trying too hard to bring the past back...asking Trish Stratus to wrestle..trying to get hogan and other legends...the point of wrestlemania should be to show off current talent and reward everyone for all their hard work over the years, not fill the show up with has been legends who just want a pay check.          BQ: Do you think this section is biased to "Top Contributors"?      I see all the time questions with a lot of great answers but the questioner gives a TC the best answer...the point of answers should be to pick the answer you like best not the most popular user. Keep in mind that many TC's cheat to get the badge and there's new great users every day, so really think about what you're doing before you just judge your question as a popularity contest.

They should get him to beat triple h because he is better than triple h and triple h doesn't need anymore title wins, and same with edge. It's like in real life triple h is screwing the bosses daughter for a 13th reign and edge storyline wise is screwing the smackdown GM vicki guerrero to get his 8th reign.

He's the same height as LeBron, and lets be honest he has a better outside shot. Durant can also get to the basket but isn't as effective as LeBron because he's so much smaller. And he's only averaging 1 less rebound per game this year.       I'm not saying Durant is better than LeBron.. i'm just saying wat if?

Sabathia   Aubrey Huff   Hunter Pence/Rick Ankiel      I give:   Jacoby Ellsbury   John Danks   Jose Valverde      The league I am in is a Keeper League.   My Closers if I gave up Valverde would be B.J. Ryan and Chad Qualls.   My 1B is Hank Blalock and my 3B is Mark Reynolds.   My Outfield consists of Josh Hamilton, Manny Ramirez, Carlos Beltran, and Andre Ethier so losing Ellsbury wouldn't mean too much especially if I get Pence or Ankiel Back.   Ellsbury is basically my only player who gets me steals( Person with the second most steals on my team, Beltran, had 25 steals compared to Ellsbury's 50 and 3rd most was under 15)   Sabthia would slide in to fill a pretty good starting rotation that would look like this:   C.C. Sabathia   Cole Hamels    Daisuke Matsuzaka   Instead of   Hamels   Matsuzaka   John Danks      Should I do this trade??   Which outfielder should I aim for.. Hunter Pence or Rick Ankiel???????????   If I could only get Pence by adding Ethier should I still do it??      Please answer all questions... not just the one about actually doing the trade.

Does anyone care about Chris Jericho anymore in WWE?, I mean for   Me, coming off watching two past Monday Night Raw tapings from the   Feb 9th and 16th dates on youtube; because I have a late bill with my   Comcast cable company, but anyway, when in storyline; Jericho had   Discussed to Ric Flair how he wished he hadn't been in his corner,   When he retired, because he felt he sold out, pandering to all the   Fans, I kind of agree with him, WWE has been known to screw some   Of their superstars over after they return from a long break; look at   The Rock, big movie star, nobody hardly recognizes him with all the   New faces in the ranks, there is no way for an superstar before the   Newcomers to stay face in storyline and there can't be too many   Faces or heels, just enough, Who was Chris Jericho pushed aside   For?, HBK? Give me a break, I looked at the clips, Jericho gets booed   When he does whenever he can to win a match, but when HBK does   It, everyone cheers him on; that's what wrong with the world, yes!!!,   Like many times, but back to now, Jericho speaks to Piper about the   Same thing; but Piper tells him he used to be fun, how could he when   He was ostrasized by what he calls the liars, cheats, and hyporcrites   Who are fans, I'm one too, but look Batista jumps on him for trying to   Be "Peacemaker between him and Shawn Michaels, Said "I don't need   You to speak for me!" He said, Was already on blast by him, HBK,   And The McMahons how can he go back to face turn from that?, My   Point too long to get to is does anyone care about him anymore?,   If Jericho leaves it wouldn't matter.

20090223130957AAi93oD	Sports;Swimming & Diving	To Swim Or Not To Swim In School?	I spent years in a school for kids with disabilities that did not have a pool. When I transferred back to public school a little over a year ago, I was in the assumption that swimming wasn't a requirement at all. Now I have been told that in a week or two, we'll have to take three whole weeks of swimming, now that the pool has been repaired (from what I don't know). At my school, refusing to participate results in a -10 for your overall quarter grade. You cannot do any alternatives or make it up in any way. Last quarter, I skipped two days so I didn't have to deal with square dancing, and that lowered my grade from a 90 to a 70, in just two days! That seems a bit unfair to me. No other class has that kind of punishment. If I refuse to swim, I will not graduate this year. I don't know where New York State law states that swimming is a requirement. Many schools don't even have a pool. I wish we didn't have one either, but my school just loves to spend money. Just recently the school has bought a huge an expensive theater-like auditorium and a new football field, as well as many other things. Now, I for one do not wish to participate in swimming. My gym period happens to be 2nd period. For swimming, I would have to change into swimsuits, revealing parts of my body I don't want to be seen. I am incredibly self conscious about my appearance. I am not even comfortable in public without a hoodie. I can't stand to wear just shorts or just a t-shirt. If anybody sees me without a shirt, it's just going to be another reason for everyone to make fun of me. Then, you have to take the time to partly dry off and strip naked, which I've never done in a locker room, and never will. And for the rest of the day, I'll have smell of chlorine, and with dry, itchy skin. Another horrible part for me is that because of my incredible self consciousness, I never go out in public without straightening my hair. I have to go to the lengths of showering at night, waiting until dry, and straightening, to then straighten as a touch up every morning. There is no way for me to somehow dry and re-straighten my hair in school after swimming. It would require the time to blow dry and straighten, taking a period's time for me. I've spent so much planning and working my way for college. I want to graduate. I want to go to college and major in Computer Engineering. I don't want to wait another year to endure another year of Hell. People may say to just get over it, it's not worth it. Well, I don't think like that. I like to question. Why must I swim in school? Why can't I perform other physical alternatives? Why does swimming matter so much that it can fail me? Many other kids like to participate in Gym but even participating in any activity is difficult enough without this. I don't even understand the entire purpose of P/E. My physical well-being is my choice. I always suffer at others hands when my physical ability is not quite on par with everyone else's expectations. And just like all expectations, it lies room for judgment. I place physical fitness low on my chart of priorities. I go to school only because I need it to further my education in something that actually, and truly, matters to me. It becomes apparent that the only way to get out of it, is if you have a legitimate  excuse from a Doctor. If it comes to it, I'll have to make a reason on my own for a Doctor to sign an excuse It doesn't seem like I have many choices anymore.

20090223135423AAK3xtM	Sports;Basketball	So whos to blame for the economy crunch?	95% percent of people like to point at bush.  But I like to point at the democrats b/c...      1) the "mortgage" crisis may have been felt in Bush's president term, but it came about in the Clintons year with his deregualtion.      2) the house was controlled by the Democrats so they had a part in everything Bush passed.      3) everyone says bush increased the defict so much, yet Obama just added a trillion dollars to that defict and it's being praised.      I think its both parties fault, but the underlying root of it was started in the Clinton years.  Beside the Iraq war I think bush did a pretty good job, people tend to focus on just the iraq war, and none of the humanitrian project that he started up?      So who do you think is to blame??

The business part of it. What happened the first time your team let you down? Was it a bad trade? Did the truth about an owner's cheap ways cause your team to lose a hot prospect or rising star? Was it the steroid scandal? Was it something else? What was it & how old were you?

Sabathia   Aubrey Huff   Hunter Pence/Rick Ankiel      I give:   Jacoby Ellsbury   John Danks   Jose Valverde      The league I am in is a Keeper League.   My Closers if I gave up Valverde would be B.J. Ryan and Chad Qualls.   My 1B is Hank Blalock and my 3B is Mark Reynolds.   My Outfield consists of Josh Hamilton, Manny Ramirez, Carlos Beltran, and Andre Ethier so losing Ellsbury wouldn't mean too much especially if I get Pence or Ankiel Back.   Ellsbury is basically my only player who gets me steals( Person with the second most steals on my team, Beltran, had 25 steals compared to Ellsbury's 50 and 3rd most was under 15)   Sabthia would slide in to fill a pretty good starting rotation that would look like this:   C.C. Sabathia   Cole Hamels    Daisuke Matsuzaka   Instead of   Hamels   Matsuzaka   John Danks      Should I do this trade??   Which outfielder should I aim for.. Hunter Pence or Rick Ankiel???????????   If I could only get Pence by adding Ethier should I still do it??      Please answer all questions... not just the one about actually doing the trade.

My mom just came back from a vacation to mexico and picked me up a lucha mask while she was down there but I have no idea what mask it is.  Right now I'm saying its one of the Tiger Masks but that is just because it has fur lining and cat like ears.  Its a black material with reflective gold pattern around the eyes, on the cheeks, and on the forehead.  Also around the bottom of the eyes is a red pattern that kinda looks like it would be eye liner to the gold and on the forehead is a green triangle.  As I previously mentioned it has fur basically sideburns and two ears.

20090223124708AAIV9nX	Sports;Fantasy Sports	Big Fantasy Trade... Do I win?	I get:   C.C. Sabathia   Aubrey Huff   Hunter Pence/Rick Ankiel      I give:   Jacoby Ellsbury   John Danks   Jose Valverde      The league I am in is a Keeper League.   My Closers if I gave up Valverde would be B.J. Ryan and Chad Qualls.   My 1B is Hank Blalock and my 3B is Mark Reynolds.   My Outfield consists of Josh Hamilton, Manny Ramirez, Carlos Beltran, and Andre Ethier so losing Ellsbury wouldn't mean too much especially if I get Pence or Ankiel Back.   Ellsbury is basically my only player who gets me steals( Person with the second most steals on my team, Beltran, had 25 steals compared to Ellsbury's 50 and 3rd most was under 15)   Sabthia would slide in to fill a pretty good starting rotation that would look like this:   C.C. Sabathia   Cole Hamels    Daisuke Matsuzaka   Instead of   Hamels   Matsuzaka   John Danks      Should I do this trade??   Which outfielder should I aim for.. Hunter Pence or Rick Ankiel???????????   If I could only get Pence by adding Ethier should I still do it??      Please answer all questions... not just the one about actually doing the trade.

My club orders from VBS Archery, from Netherlands, but I think the prices there are too high.   So riser/limbs suggestions, please, and where to buy those from:)
