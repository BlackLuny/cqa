20090304090814AAg9H28	Consumer Electronics;Cell Phones & Plans	Water Damaged Cell Phone Static Noise?	Ok so i dropped my cell phone in the sink and took it out real fast. i tried ti turn it off via holding the power button, but the screen remained on, the flickered off. as i went to take out the battery i noticed that when i moved the battery the phone made a static noise. With the battery out i put both in a cup of rice and let it sit over night. whenever i even make contact with the battery and the phone it makes the same static noise without even having the phone on. I can assume the phone is water damaged and i already know to dry it out etc, my question is did i fry something (the reasoning for the static noise and if it will go away or if its totally gone?)

Hi      My trusty US-purchased JVC Mini DV camcorder broke recently and I bought a newer JVC model in the UK. My old raw video tape archives won't play on the new camcorder. The new one is widescreen format, but can be changed back to standard format. Neither is HD. The only other difference is where I bought them one in the US and one in the UK.      Two questions really - help me understand and fix the problem. Is there a region-specific coding on Mini DV tapes (PAL vs NTSC) or has the encoding JVC uses changed in the last 4 years. What can I do to play the "old" tapes?      Thanks!!

Now if the game has said on the back of the box MINIMUM  REQUIREMENTS:  Processor: Intel Pentium?4  2GHz I am sure the game would run on a Laptop as well as a PC.      People, please tell me what do you think?      NOTE:  Also they said they refunded me in full and are sending me a replacement even though I told them about the disc having a dodgy mark like ring all the way around the laser side of the disc and they don't want to know anything about the fact that the game company itself (the people who made the game) had a lawsuit against them because of getting fans hopes up too high and also the games supporters, Piranha Bytes had ceased supporting the game.   My game says "JoWood Productions Presents A Piranha Bytes Game" (which I just explained that Piranha Bytes had a bad reputation when creating the game and selling it when it was still incomplete)

20070330090607AAKCfJs	Consumer Electronics;Cell Phones & Plans	Tech savvy people, can a cell phone be hacked this way?	Ok, before I married my husband I found text messages in the Inbox and Outbox on his cell phone which was back in October 2003 the phone was a Verizon LG VX6000.  There were text messages to and from a girl indicating that he was cheating on me.  He still swears to this day that his phone must have been hacked and  that he did not send those messages.  I was there one day when he received one of the messages and remember watching him snap his phone shut very quickly.  My husband is a very computer savvy man and he says a Linux hacker could've done this but I still do not believe this and people I've spoken to in the cell industry said this would not be possible.  My husband had made an enemy of a Linux hacker but I think this seems ridiculous.  So, for those of you who are tech savvy...could this really have happened?

Hi, bought myself a Medion MDSP150 Smartphone with the bundled Sat Nav hardware and software but having trouble getting it to work.      I've got power coming from the cigarette lighter to the unit (noticable via the green light on the Sat Nav box, which seems to flash at random) and a cable running from the GPS unit to the phone (which I've tested as working).       I boot up the Medion Navigator software, but it doesn't seem to detect the GPS unit.      Having fiddled with the settings, I found an option to change the GPS receiver, which I've left as Standard GPS.      Can anyone shed any light on this or point me in the right direction?

20070322191320AALXOUU	Consumer Electronics;Cell Phones & Plans	Low radiation, simple, cheap cell phones that work in the United States?	hi, folks,   I'm looking to purchase the lowest possible radiation (SAR) emitting cell phone that is also simple and relatively inexpensive.  Any recommendations? I just want a phone that allows me to (obviously) make/receive phone calls with caller ID and send/receive text messages... I don't care for phones w/features for emails, taking photos, mp3 recording, etc etc... I'm old school.  So, my first priority is the low radiation level of the cell phone.  Second priority is price.  Third priority is simplicity.  I'm not interested in debates about whether radiation matters either... mmkay?       I heard the LG Chocolate has a low SAR rating-- but it also has fancy features (you can listen to music) and thus is quite expensive.  Any advice?  I'm happy to choose a best answer.

I've been all over the web, and no one that writes about Helio's upcoming "Ocean" phone seems to know which operating system it's built on.  Is it Windows Mobile?  Is it Linux?  Did Helio write their own proprietary OS similar to Palm OS?     Obviously Helio wrote the software for the interface, but is this the operating system, or just a stack of UI software on top of a commercial OS? (such as Windows Mobile 6.0)      The Helio supposedly runs "Plays for Sh#t" music on it, so that makes me think the OS is WM 6.0.

20090227054939AAq9oCA	Consumer Electronics;Music & Music Players	Questions about selling iPod on Ebay or Craigslist?	My husband has acquired 4 ipods, and obviously we don't need them all.  He asked me to sell a couple on Ebay for him (I'm an avid ebayer).  I don't know much about the iPods and he doesn't know anything about selling online. . .so we need some clarifications.      1.  I'm assuming it's legal to sell a used iPod, right?  Just double checking.      2.  Can/do I sell it with the 400+ songs that are on it (all were legally bought from iTunes)?  Or does that not work?  Is that legal?      3.  One of the iPods was dropped in a cup of Mountain Dew, it rarely works right.  On ebay I noticed people selling iPods "as is" (that are broken, etc.).  If an iPod was completely submerged in above said Mountain Dew, will it be worth anything to anyone - will any parts still be usable?  I would, no doubt, be 100% honest in the listing about what happened to it.  I'm an honest person and ebay seller.      Even if you can only answer one of the questions, it will be greatly appreciated!      Thanks in advance!

I just got this brand new computer because my other computer has a horrible mishap and it was getting old :P   It's a Mac and there are no songs on my iTunes and i can't get into my iTunes account b/c i forgot my Apple ID and i've tried the whole week to get in, but, it obviously isn't going to work.    On my other computer (also a mac) my iPod would only sync what was there, and delete the stuff that wasn't there, it would never keep any of the songs that wasn't on my iTunes. I'm sorry, i don't know how to explain it. W/e was on my iTunes was on my iPod, like if i got a new album, sync my iPod, delete the album and sync my iPod again, the album would be gone.    I just bought a boatload of new music and it's only on my iPod, which has gone black and i've just learned that maybe if i plug it into my computer, it may fix the problem. My question is, if i plug my iPod into my computer, will it erase all my songs? i'm really worried.   i'm also sorry that this question is soooooo long :P

20081119032632AAve6XU	Consumer Electronics;Games & Gear;Xbox	Is it safe to buy a Xbox 360?	I read up about the 360 because my friends told me about these things called the "Rings of Death". Overheating is the last thing on my mind since I'm busy most of the time, but I found out that Xbox has so many other general hardware failures.  Is it safe to buy a 360 Arcade? I'm not too sure if I want to buy a 360 that has a 60% chance of breaking after 12 months. I also heard it isn't safe around kids.      I'm just interested in playing the 360. Not interested in Live at the moment, but can you play with people in the same room if I buy a couple of controllers? Christmas is coming up, and I want to bring it so the kids can play together.      What is great about the PS3? What happened to PS2? Didn't they just release a small one last year or something?
