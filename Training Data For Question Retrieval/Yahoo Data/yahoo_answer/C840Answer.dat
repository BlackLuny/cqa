aa29680a90b3d0a47305805b40b169acaa	Without more information, there is only so much that we can comment on.  However, a $0 in box two is definitely key to the answer.    Federal withholding is essentially a prepayment of your estimated taxes spread evenly throughout the year.  Just taking a quick look at the amount of SS and Medicare withholdings, I would guess that you earned around $15,000.  Assuming you are not itemizing, have no other taxable income, deductions or credits, and you are not claiming head of household, you standard deduction and personal exemption (also assuming your are not being claimed on someone else's return) would be $8,950, leaving about $6,000 of taxable income - and you had no withholding, so now you have to pay.    You may want to look at your W-4 form or check with the payroll department as to the number of dependency claims they are using to calculate you paycheck.  The more dependents claimed on the W-4, the less that is withheld.  You can always request additional withholding.  However, do this judiciously.    Besides, large tax refunds of purely federal withholding (excluding refundable credits) means you just gave the federal government an interest free loan.  Do you really want to do that?|`|fuQH62V1aa	since no federal tax was withheld.. then thats why you gotta pay in. your employer didnt hold any taxes out of your paycheck for 2008. you need to check with your employer and change the number of exemptions so that they will take federal taxes out of your checks for 2009.    if you have kids.. then you can get earned income...and lots of other deductions.. which would mean you get more back.     but if you are single like me.. no kids.. then all you really get back is the taxes you paid in minus the amount the IRS keeps for your taxes. it sucks.    why arent you getting federal taxes withheld?  umm  probably something to do with the papers you had to fill out when you got hired.. im not sure what form its called.. but the paper im talking about is the one that you gotta write  1 for yourself and however many exemptions your claiming.  CHECK WITH PERSONEL OR YOUR BOSS ASAP TO GET THAT FIXED.. SO THAT THEY WILL START WITHHOLDING FEDERAL TAXES AND WHEN YOU DO YOUR TAXES FOR 2009 YOU WILL HOPEFULLY GET A REFUND.  whoops sorry for caps.|`|0S7JNY5Aaa	Withholdings. Check out box 2 of your w2.|`|NwkZ5OmCaa	Well, duh, you made about $15325 and had nothing withheld.  That means you got your 'refund' each week in your paycheck.    Single, no dependent, income 15325, taxable income 9375, tax about $1005 and you had nothing withheld.

I've known union workers that could retire before age 60 and get a pension equal to their former 40hr a week wages ($70k+) and then they can go out and get another job - and lots of them get fully paid health insurance in retirement - how is that fair? I still have 14 yrs to go until retirement and if I'm lucky and my annual returns from the stock market get back to 7-10% a year, I MIGHT be able to retire on 30-40% of what I'm making now - including Social security benefits.

aa29680a90b3d0a47305805b40b169acaa	I agree that the additional child may not result in an additional $1,000 refund, however it will effect your overall return and needs to be corrected.      I am assuming that the return was filed by J.H. If that is the case, then you will have to file an amended return, to see if there is any additional refund owing to you.    Your first step is to take all your information, including the incorrect return, back to the J.H. office that you went to.  I would recommend asking to talk with the manager or whomever at these places oversees all the preparers.  Show this person the documentation and request that they, free of charge, correct the misstake and file an amended return.  My experience is that you should allow 2 weeks between filing the original and the amended, as this hopefully gives the IRS time to get the original return entered into their system before the amended gets entered.    If this office refuses or insists on charging you, I would take you return elsewhere for correction.  I would rather pay someone else to correct the return than them.|`|NwkZ5OmCaa	And was your income at least $21,833?

Take it somewhere else and see if they will review it.|`|E13OkjTYaa	The $1,000 is a deduction, not a credit. So, you probably won't benefit from having that extra child on your taxes.

6e7991da1c49af3d2df013970572c123aa	Yes.  A pawn shop is not a bank.  When you didn't pay back the money they got to keep your things and sell them at a profit.  People do it all the time.

0u6qy9Uuaa	the lack of insulation is probably a bigger is than the windows - look into the cost of getting loose insulation blown into the walls - compare that to the cost of replacing the windows (including installation costs).     Without knowing what tyoe of heat you have, I can't project savings - talk to an insulation guy or the utility company for estimates?  The wall insulation would be the primary help in savings - windows another 10% - AFTER you get the walls insulated. compare the projected savings over a year and see how many years it would take to recoup your costs.    I;m thinking the insulation would pay for itself in a few yrs - there may also be federal tax credits for some of that cost also    I have a 100+ yr old house too - it was insulated, but the windows were in bad shape - I only owned the house a few months before I replaced them, so I'm not sure how much I saved, but it's comfortable inside - I have oil, hot water radiator heat - only 1000 sq ft|`|LOrFtSCHaa	Yes they definitely work, I would suggest you to think about purchasing a wood stove, for the size of your home it will probable cost you around $3K you need either a big one or 2 small ones, let me tell you it is work spending the money you buy 2 cords of wood for the winter and it pays itself within 2 yrs.  The cost of the wood will be the cost of heating your home for the whole winter.  You will save a lot, also spend some money in new insulation for the house, and if you have basements maybe you should also think about new carpet and basement insulation.      Good Luck|`|WiUqRhsaaa	It depens on the condition of the house. If you have a house that is out of shape and need other rapair other than the windows dont was'te your money on the windows. but if that the only thing you need are new window cosmeticly they make a house look totaly different not only will they save you money in electric bills by kepping your house warm in the winter and cool in the summer because new window are a great insulater, and the will raise the value of your home. and they look great.|`|Hx88UGlpaa	As well as wisegirls advice, window insulation in the winter also helps. I also live in a very old house and have to close up the windows to keep the utility bill down. We have a fireplace and use it as much as we can to keep any plug in heaters from using too much electricity. Our house is very well insulated, but every little bit helps. If you have wood flooring...throw scatter rugs down as this helps with the heat as well. Good Luck!!|`|l5cxmTb9aa	It's impossible to say how much you would save because we know absolutely nothing about your existing windows. We don't know how cold it is outside or how warm you like to keep it inside.  Getting new windows would certainly help with the energy efficiency though. After fixing potential air leaks and making sure your attic and basement (if applicable) are insulated, the windows would probably rank next.  Put one hand on a window and the other hand on the adjacent wall. The difference in temperature will illustrate the insulative parity between them.     Don't forget to check with your local utilities to see if they have any programs that might help underwrite making your home more efficient. Often they will send someone out free of charge to do an analysis of your home.  Sometimes window contractors will know about these programs also since they help to sell their products and services.    p.s. You might want to consider closing off part of the house in the winter if you want to save money. 3000 sq.ft is a big house.|`|Tyq8OYm1aa	Yes, they help.  The work is not cheap, however.

Different states have different assistance.|`|WxoZrTPlaa	You have to work with your lender.  However, once you get to the foreclosure stage, it's often too late.  As soon as you realize you're having difficulties, you should contact your lender and see what they can do to work with you.  They'd rather not do the foreclosure thing, either.|`|MvC6n3DWaa	First, call the lender and try to work out an arrangement. Your loan may be owned by multiple creditors. In some ways, it makes it tricky, in other ways it exposes them. If you are up to date and never late, you can refinance. Sounds like that is not the case. They may modify your loan, but the problem is that the creidtors have to be in agreement. In some cases, they do not know who actually owns the loan at this point. Request the information in writing in addition to the original loan documents that you signed. You will be surprised that alot of the lenders do not have the loan documents as the loan was already to sold. Send the letter certified. There are websites on this....  If you have the money, get an attorney, but that can be expensive.
AA12145054	The CV is typically the first item that a potential employer encounters regarding the job seeker and is typically used to screen applicants, often followed by an interview, when seeking employment.    A CV should be viewed as a Marketing Tool and is mainly used to entice an employer into giving you an interview. Sometimes when you are applying for a job you need to fill out an Application Form or write a Cover Letter but usually a CV will be required too. It gives a prospective employer:    ? A snapshot of who you are.  ? Information on the relevant skills and experience you have for a specific job.  ? Information on relevant transferable skills you have when applying for a job in a different industry.  ? Information on your past work experience.  ? Information on any qualifications you have gained.  ? Information on any relevant training courses you have been on.  ? An idea of your hobbies, pastimes and what you like to do in your leisure time.  ? Personal Contact details.      Curriculum vitae is Latin meaning "course of life" and rsum is French meaning "summary".

aa29680a90b3d0a47305805b40b169acaa	Yes you do.  You must include this as taxable income on your return and it will be used in calculating your income tax payable. Depending on your withholding from the other job and your deductions and credits, you may or may not see an effect on the bottom line.  Your refund might decrease in relation to the increase in taxable income and increase in income tax, but it is tough for me to tell you exactly how much.    As others have mentioned, when you receive a 1099, that means the IRS has it as well, and if you fail to include it and it effects the amount of income tax, they will let you know.|`|9a881112567263b20d6262238853cc86aa	Yes    As your W2 job put you over the filing requirement, ANY additional income must be reported.    As the 1099Misc is over $400, it must be reported on Schedule C.    How much you owe or have refunded is calculated on your total income not each item individually.|`|uiOFJasoaa	yeah, you have to file ALL income.|`|2N6oTOLQaa	if the $650 on the 1099 had been your only income, you could have skipped your tax return this year. However, since the $15,000 from the other job requires you to file, you must report ALL income, including the extra $650.     Note, the company that sent you the 1099 also sent a copy to the IRS, so the IRS knows about the income and you won't get away with not reporting it.

The only thing a cell phone might do is ding your credit report and therefore hurt your rating slightly.  Why do so many kids believe this builds credit?  /|`|Tyq8OYm1aa	http://credit.about.com
XAetFJXsaa	It takes a long time. I started building credit at 18. I'm 22 now and just recently aquired a score right at 600...I think the highest you can go is 800. I pay all of my bills on time and my car loan on time, plus pay my credit card bill (which is never more than $100) regularly. I have 2 negative items on my credit that are showed as paid, but even though they've been paid for almost 2 years now, it still affects my score. Its much harder than people think. My advice to you would be to get a credit card. You'll want to make it so that your maximum is not more than $500, that way you wont be tempted to go crazy with spending and its an easy amount to pay off. Start buying gas and groceries with your card and pay it off like clockwork every month...this is the easiest way to build credit, but its still going to take time.|`|0yqQg9CXaa	Open a checking account and keep it in good standing for 6 solid months.  Ask them for a visa card tied to the account - that's the easiest way.  You will also need a job for 6 months.  /|`|EX1GjjJCaa	I wish I knew the answer to that also.|`|cLtzGveRaa	Your score can soar within 6 months to a year, but won't be considered solid for a couple of years.    My suggestion to build your credit would be to talk to your bank about a credit card - secured if necessary.  Make sure you are never billed for more than 10% of the available credit and pay it in full every month.    Second, also take out a small installment loan from the bank.  Use the funds you receive to lock into a savings account you can't touch and pledge it as security.  Take the loan out over 2 years.  At the end of 2 years you will have great credit.    Only do this if you have the income to cover it or you will damage your score, which will then take years to recover from.
0yqQg9CXaa	Nope.  Neither does renting furniture, or buying a cell phone, or even paying utilities on time.  /|`|AA10873763	No, they don't report to the credit bureaus.  And considering they're closing stores left and right, may not be the best investment anyway.
c8408e38ad182b36d098a27e75154640aa	If you plan on selling the house in 5 years or later then it makes sense to go ahead and do the refinance now.  You will be lowering your payments by $100 or $6000 over the next 5 years.    The information that is missing from this equation is the cost of the loan.  What is your current principle? What will be your principle on the new loan?  $6000 - the difference in your principle will tell you if it is a good idea.  If this is a positive number, then you come out ahead.  If this is a negative number, then you are actually losing money.    Also note, if you sell your house before 5 years, then this calculation will change.  If you end up selling in 1-2 years then this will probably be a bad thing.    As far as tax benefits and penalties, there are none, just the standard tax deduction for Mortgage insurance.  As far as your credit score, it may negatively affect your credit score if they have to pull your credit report again.  Anytime your credit report is pulled for credit or loan purposes it is flagged.  Since this will be for a home loan it will not be a major red flag, but it will pop up on the credit report as a credit inquirery.|`|0u6qy9Uuaa	if the only cost is $2000 and you don;t have a problem with that - you could recoup that cost in 20 months, so if you are planning on staying for 5 yrs, then you'll save money over that time, so it's worthwhile doing|`|8yQYmxVOaa	No you lose the tiny bit of equity you have aquired and have raised what you owe on the home, plus a tax loss as you can claim the interest. short term you will lose|`|Tyq8OYm1aa	Check for the FHA "Streamline" refinance.|`|AA11173563	by saving just $100 I would not as it will take at least 80 months to break even on this and selling in year 5 you will loose. Now if you can drop to a 25 year note for the same $ then yes do it|`|VPycXVIlaa	Refinancing won't have any effect on your credit score. You're borrowing the same amount of money (or close too it) so your debt to credit ratio won't change which is mostly what your score is based on.    There aren't any tax benefits or penalties to refinancing that I know of.     The down side of refinancing is the closing fees.. which can be around $1000-$2000. This might take a couple years to pay down. If you plan on staying in the house for more than 4 or 5 years then it is definitely worth it because you are paying less in interest over the long run. If you don't plan on staying in the house for long then it's not worth it because you'll only end up paying back the cost of refinancing fees.     Also, it can be worth it if that $100 savings really makes a big difference in your budget. If it does then it's probably worth your time to do it.
RNqRnG86aa	The principal must give, or be deemed to give, the agent authority to act. The authority can be in the following forms:    Actual authority  Apparent authority  Implied authority  Authority by virtue of a position held    An agent's authority can be terminated at any time by the principal. The principal can revoke the agency in writing, orally, by removing the agent from the position held or public advertising. The power of attorney must be revoked in the same manner in which it was given.

Since you've been there a year with a stellar payment history, and since you don't owe any outstanding fees to the prior apartment complex, you've basically been cleared of any debt...so they'll probably more than gladly let you renew.   Renewing your lease is just a technicality anyway...it's just another way of saying you have no plans to move out.  The lease contract will continue on as usual.  Also, you have extra back-up because you have a co-signer.|`|0u6qy9Uuaa	if you are "renewing" a lease, I doubt they would do another credit check.

Good luck.|`|fa49fc3460e0c0dfb37b6cda6aa1dd56aa	There may be plenty of reasons for a non-renewal.  Only your current manager would know the answer to this.  Being that you've been a good paying tenant for the duration of your lease is in your favor....I wouldn't sweat it.|`|XowM9e7Naa	Do not worry over this.  You are in the new apartment and have a good history with them.  They will not check on you at the time of renewal.  Do not plan on moving for a few years, because then the eviction will show up.

A case could be made for the $800 sale price as donated vehicles can only be written off by the donor for the amount the vehicle actually sold for.     Personally, I always go on the conservative side to avoid having issues if audited.|`|Pjm9pg7iaa	You can deduct what you paid for the item when you bought it.

(Or, you might want to try to get on one of the TV court shows.)  Be prepared when you go to court.  Tell the judge the story in straight terms, just like you did in your question.  Bring your cell phone to show the judge her messages.  If you have a witness to any conversations you had with her on the job and payment, try to bring the witness with you (not a relative if you have someone else like a friend or better yet a neutral party).   Note: in some jurisdictions, if you prevail, the other party has to pay your court costs.  Sounds like you have a solid case.

Also consider investing a very small amount, such as $100, in a risky investment but one that could yield a high return. The amount is so small that you can't get hurt much if it fails, but it could be worth 10-20 times as much in 2-3 years. It cost nothing to look into it without any obligation.

kWL2Zt4raa	Is it the first time you have ever lost your job?      Perhaps this may have created some fear and worry about the same thing happening again after receiving a blow to your self confidence.      At this point, i'd suggest going to workplaces and physically handing out your resume to help you on your way to getting back out there and building up your self confidence again.      Keeping in touch with your friends from your last job may be a good idea, most jobs i've had have been through people i know rather than replying to ads.    Its also important to find peace of mind in regards to your last position, learn from it and hopefully not repeat the same mistakes, if we didn't make mistakes we wouldn't learn much.|`|d8fG3NUdaa	Hopefully you filed unemployment.  Most unemployment offices will help you find another job.  Look for temp agencies in your area.  Applying for only one position is like asking to win the lottery.  There could be hundreds of resumes in that stack competing for that ONE job.  The trick is to apply to several jobs, apply to different places like everyday.  Set up an account with Monster.com, Career Builder, and Craigslist.org.  And I cannot stress enough of this--SELF CONFIDENCE!!  Self confidence and a positive attitude is very critical in job hunting.  Networking is also very important!  Because sometimes its not what you know, but who you know.  Seriously, I understand where you're coming from.  This economy has hurt a lot of people.  I'm fresh out of college and yet I only have a seasonal job, where I don't work in the winter.  For me, finding a better job has been a b*tch!  I was lucky to get to the interview stage in some cases, times are tough now.  That's why I hope to fall back on my seasonal job.  It sounds like your biggest fear is rejection--I feel your pain right there!  Keep moving forward, keep putting yourself out there--self confidence and having very supportive people around will help with this.  Don't get discouraged!  Keep in mind that our economy is in the sh*tter right now, so it could take you a while.  In order to keep your skills and experience up, try volunteering or taking a class.  That's what I'm doing, and it's still worthy to put on your resume.  I believe in you, best of luck.

As stated above, you can lose your voucher.  They will have to re-certify you with his income, and you will most likely lose in entirely.    Also, if he does not move in but you still quit your job, then you MUST let section 8 know.

Your relevant experience, which should include the name of the job and what city it was located in, your job title, and three bullet points that explain your responsibilities.     You can also put your education, if you're working towards a degree that is relevant to the job.     You can include awards or computer programs you're familiar with, if they are relevant.

When I was in the 12th grade, I wanted to be a Dentist. Well when I got into college, I realized there was a TON of chemistry classes that I would have to take and I quickly changed my mind.     My freshman year in college, I picked up construction management; I'm a critical thinker, I've always been interested in engineering disciplines, and I've always wanted be apart of a project(s) where I would get together with a group of people to to build something whether it be a house or  a muti-billion dollar commercial building.     Oh, and my family is also in the field and construction management never even crossed my mind. So through all my career searching, the answer was right there in my face!    Its not all about what will make you the most money when choosing a career path, but something that you would enjoy doing till you retire. I'm in my senior year in college and I cant wait till I'm finished.     By the time you get into college, you'll know what you want to do. If not, just take your basics and get them out of the way and then by that time, you should know what you want to do.    Good Luck!
Ti0q1Btiaa	You really need some experience in retail.    Aside from capital and/or credit, you need to learn how to plan inventory.    Be able to plan into one season, peak, decline, and into the next season.  This has to be done for each category of   clothing and by colors.  Think of skirts, tops, jeans, lingerie, etc.  Everything that you wear.  Shoes are  different, so many sizes to stock.  You'll need to know how to create a budget, buying, markup, break even point, and expenses>fixed and discretionary.  That's a tall order without experience.    Of course you'll need wholesale suppliers.  Most of those are directly from China, but they may have distribution centers in CA or NY.  I don't know now.    Having said that, these are the basics of retail.  Merchandising   Advertising  Organization  Display    An old adage.  The right merchandise, at the right price, at the right time.    Consider this.  You must be aware of all the store closings.  I'm not sure that they will all come back.    INTERNET.  This is cutting into all retail stores.  It will become stronger in my opinion.    Accounting can be done by others, but, there is a plethora of software out there, even for inventory control and planning.

After you add this account you will want to confirm it. By confirm, I mean that paypal will make two smalls deposits into your bank account equaling less than $1 and then you will go back onto your paypal account and enter those amounts in and then you can transfer money. They do this to ensure that you truely are the owner of the account that you say you are. After confirmation all you need to do is select transfer money. Select free bank account transfer and the process should take about 3-4 business day. The money will show up in your account as a deposit.

It is a plan for saving and spending. [1]A budget is an important concept in microeconomics, which uses a budget line to illustrate the trade-offs between two or more goods. In other terms, a budget is an organizational plan stated in monetary terms.    In summary, the purpose of budgeting is to:       1. Provide a forecast of revenues and expenditures i.e. construct a model of how our business might perform financially speaking if certain strategies, events and plans are carried out.     2. Enable the actual financial operation of the business to be measured against the forecast.

Nobody expects you to have work experience at that age. If you're going around to retail places (the mall or grocery stores) or fast food places then they don't require a resume, just an application.    Honestly, you really don't need a resume until you're out of high school and have had more than 2 or 3 steady jobs. And when you're ready to apply in an office or for a big company.|`|02f7b3b923fd704bc0dba673da12d388aa	jobstar.org|`|6rXyaUAoaa	The important thing is to get experience, try to do what really interests you if you have a choice (if you are a people person don't sit behind a desk but be a grocery clerk etc.)    Try to stay at your jobs from now on for at least a year if you can. It looks good on your resume.    The best place to find jobs at your age is in stores such as Ross, Best Buy, Mervyns or local grocery stores - cashiering type of things.    Don't forget to buff up your resume and get good references from teachers, ministers, volunteer jobs, even baby sitting to show you are a good reliable person. Make several copies of each letter and keep in a file.    When interviewing remember the navy and white blouse rule - no gawdy jewelry or piercings are a turn off. no flip flops and simple make up if you're a girl (or not).    Also make copies of any certificates you have earned such as computer etc and keep in that same file. Attach them to your application/remsume with your reference letters.     You will look too good to turn down!

You and he obviously know what the problem is.  2) Shut it down yourself by opening the cover and finding the disconnection point.  3) If you don't pay electric and if it doesn't bother you too much, leave it on all day long! The neighbors will either get used to it or they'll be pissed off enough that the landlord will have to replace it.    And no. They can not tell you how often to use the bathroom.

QSmfOUndaa	I looked at the website today and it said anywhere from $8-$20/hr
traGYlsgaa	I have not heard anything about the government doing anything to help with people you have fixed there rate when rates were going up and have been left at rates like yours (9% plus).      With rates as low as 4.69% available the banks will not normally budge on the break costs of loan such as yours. The reason the BREAK COST is so high is because when they signed the contract the bank has a contract that you will pay 9% for 5 yrs for example.     Now with the interest rates falling by the large amount that they have if they cancel the loan the bank will only be able to re-lend the money at 6% for example.            $500,000.00 x 9% = $45,000.00 a year in interest   $45,000.00 x 5 = $225,000.00          $500,000.00 x 6% = $30,000.00 a year in interest  $30,000.00 x 5 = $150,000.00   $225,000.00 - $150,000.00 = $75,000.00 (in lost interest/profit for the bank)     So in this example the bank looks to make up this loss by charging the client (e.g. you) the break costs.     I know this does not seem fair to pay but in the reverse if you locked in at 6% and rates had risen to 9% you in the above example would have saved the $75,000.00.     I hope this helps you understand why the break costs are so high. It may be worth seeing a mortgage broker to see what options you have and do the math and see if you could potential save many by paying the break costs and refinancing.     It always pays to get good professional advice and I would be more than happy to help if you would like.

JXJvxhZPaa	The IRS doesn't start seizing assets until things get pretty serious.  Those back taxes will stay on your record and they could result in fines in years to come, so you really ought to pay them.  The stimulus check was not really from the IRS per se.  They didn't initiate it, so it wasn't their place to take money out of it.|`|UDxL7lPqaa	If you owe federal back taxes, they will take it.  State taxes are separate.
AA10608549	Your confused?  -- I can't even begin to figure out what you're trying to say!  -- How much is the payment?  Who makes the payment? from who to who - Turn around profit time?  - do you mean - when the new owner will see a "profit" ? - What's the profit breakdown per month - is that all the expenses paid in advance/how much is the present owner paying himself out of the proceeds of the ongoing business - is the "profit" all the money left over from the operation of the business that's not used to pay expenses & salaries???   Sounds like a "wiggle" question -- in order to back away from purchasing your business!  If you presented a viable business model - then Profits over expenses would be anything you or them considered profits.  I think the question asked is How much money does this business pay - if I do it your way - and I don't care- cause I'm going to do it my way - which is better than yours - and you should lower the price - cause I don't believe that it pays enuf "Profit"  (That's my quess)|`|G6agS6xhaa	Hey, I've got an MBA, and I'm not certain what she's asking for.    Regardless the other issue here, is that it is her job to do the due diligence.  She's the one that needs to be calculating this stuff out based on her own projections.    The minute you provide ANY of those projections, you have assumed a huge liability when she DOESN'T meet those projections for whatever reason, legitimate or not.    These are things that she needs to be prepared to do on her own.

9vvaFxEeaa	You don't just file suit against the individual that has been harassing you.  You name your employer as a defendant.  An employer's failure to remedy something like sexual harassment can be found to be a form of discrimination.  I don't know anything about your situation and certainly cannot give legal advice over the internet, but if you have a valid claim then sue your employer.  Suing the individual that is harassing you would probably result, at best, in a judgment that you couldn't collect.  You have to sue the people with the deep pockets.|`|UDxL7lPqaa	You are too nonspecific.  What is this alleged harassment?|`|ZZQk010faa	Yes.

2J5Nz5eKaa	Anyone can call themselves a tax preparer - there is no license required or standard to meet.  Employees of H&R Block (I was one for 2 years) have taken the in-house courses.  They are required to keep taking classes every year to expand and update their tax knowledge.  They may or may not have had any other training.  The best H&R Block preparers are at the Premium offices, but of course they cost more.  I own a bookkeeping business now and don't provide tax preparation services.  When I review my client's tax returns, I often find mistakes.  It doesn't matter who prepared it, I find missing info and other bad mistakes on returns prepared by CPAs too.  You should ALWAYS look at your tax return and make sure you understand it before you send it to the IRS!|`|JXJvxhZPaa	The just took some tax preparation courses, for the most part.  A CPA would generally make a lot more working for an accounting firm.|`|98b98bd5749baadc8ce32ff1f2759dceaa	they just took some class...they are simply in putting info into a tax program...just as you would if doing your own taxes such as with turbo tax...|`|JsHG73v9aa	Some may be accountants or CPA's, but most aren't. H&R preparers take a course from H&R. There are several levels of education which qualify them to prepare taxes based on the forms that need to be filed, so the preparer should be qualified to help you with your return. (I am NOT an employee of H&R Block)|`|dqhBgRT6aa	No.  The tax preparers at H&R Block are average people who take a few classes.  They input your tax information into a computer program that does all the work.     There are a few CPAs at H&R Block but they only do heavy duty work or oversee the work of others.  In general, the person doing your taxes is just like you, only they've taken some informational courses.    H&R did our taxes one year and made more than one mistake on our tax return, including omitting information that I had given them.  The biggest mistake cost us $1500 and I had to argue with them to get them to even look at the mistake they had made.  We ended up having to amend our return and then wait several months for the additional refund due us.  I would not use H&R Block again.

UeLigNB0aa	For an FHA loan you will need 3.5%.  For a conventional loan you'll need at 5% but in CA you may need as much as 10-15% for a conventional because of declining market issues.|`|JXJvxhZPaa	Are you talking about a down payment or a good faith deposit?  Assuming you mean down payment, a first time homeowner should ideally but 20% down, or $50,000 in your case.  Some banks will let you get by with less, but it will cost you.  Until you own 20% of the principal, you will have to pay private mortgage insurance.  For a $250K house, that could be around $150 a month (in addition to your regular mortgage payment).|`|AA11112154	Depends on the loan and bank you get. Most banks won't do it for less than 3% these days (those are mainly FHA if you qualify income wise). Others require 5% and some still stick to the 20%. It's always good to have the 5% as a bare minimum. 20% is better but I wouldn't advise it unless you have more money saved up in case you lose your jobs or something.    I put 3% down and ended up leaving my job 2 months after buying but I had $20K saved up so I have enough to support myself for at least 6-10 months and not worry.    Good luck!|`|FszZgaZHaa	Typically 20% down is the standard for average/good credit - if you have excellent credit less, poor credit usually a lot more|`|tdQTZPI7aa	Deposit can be as little as a 100.  If you mean the downpayment then 20%  50k
BoAEgaAGaa	If you are preparing your return in a tax program, then you would enter each W-2 separately.

49740c9daeea677fc86801fb2b3f41deaa	Any laws to limit the rent would be city specific, you need to find out if there is rent control.    Rent control would limit how much per year, not over the entire time you were renting.    There are no state or federal limits on rental rates.|`|AA11206283	Do we have to tell you to move|`|tdQTZPI7aa	No  You pay whatever the landlord charges or you move|`|w4OGnyn8aa	That is probably normal. Over a span of 12 years, that isn't that much. What was it when you moved in? And now?|`|AA10045620	Up 50% in 12 years is not bad at all considering the rising taxes and insurance costs.|`|RZzMse3Haa	There is no law regulating how much it goes up over all over a period of time.  The laws only regulate how much it goes up at a single increase.    50% over 12 years is not bad.  You have to expect increases in a long term rental!|`|JsHG73v9aa	Sorry, no. When your lease expires your rent can change. You have the option to not renew and find another crappy place that is cheaper.|`|AOPuoo16aa	Their are laws on how much the landlord can raise your rent every tim you sign a new lease but there is no limit on how much they can raise your rent over years and years of living there and signing a new lease every few years.|`|lLm5uIuDaa	No there isn't. If you continue to choose to live in a bad place then that is your choice.  Rents always raise no matter where you live or how bad the location is.  Sounds like you need to find a new place to live but the rent will continue to grow there as well.  Your choice.  Prices go up and so do rents and home costs.  Nothing is static.  In 12 years your ability to pay should have risen as well if your are career driven so the increases shouldn't be an issue or you would be out.|`|4UBxVIYFaa	Did you expect your rent rate to stay the same forever ?  Of course not.  Fifty percent over twelve years is about normal.  If you do not like it, look for another place to move.  (And find out what OTHERS are charging.)
qHMBkLx2aa	Your question got cut off but if you can't successfully finish a McDonalds application you need to pay more attention in school.|`|lCtl1L3kaa	You think you forgot to put your name on the application?  Do you REALLY think you forgot, or are you just letting your nerves get the best of you because they didn't call?    Don't be alarmed if they don't call right away.  Whomever does the hiring sometimes waits until there's a bunch of applications to sort through before starting to make calls.  They'll sift through the pile and decide who they're interested in.  This could take a week or longer.      If a week goes by and you haven't heard anything, stop by.  If you go in now and admit that you may have forgotten to put your name on the application, you just end up looking irresponsible.  How could they hire someone who even can't fill out an application?  I'm not being harsh, I just telling you what they'd be thinking.    If you really did forget, then no harm done.  They have no idea who filled it out wrong, they don't know it's you.  If you messed it up, then it's your secret.  If you don't hear back, wait a while and re-apply.    Good luck!
MkZF3pqXaa	You could look at it as a government bailout, but there are consequences to those actions.  If your debt is gone because of bankruptcy, you can no longer get credit for almost a decade without paying high interest rates, if at all.      Individuals in need of help do get help, but there also has to be a change of habits.  The government is also requiring a change of habits from companies recieving LOANS from the government to stay afloat and provide vital goods and services to the American people.

ZA8jGhtQaa	I see these situations quite often.  Instead of looking at this as a huge problem, you can leverage it to be a great marketing opportunity.     First, you get the chance to pick a new and better brand.  Second, you have a great excuse to contact everyone you know and thereby drum up more business.      This comes at a cost, but if you approach the other side appropriately they will usually gladly pay you.  This can save them from the expense of having to sue you, and it gets them immediate and guaranteed results.  They should give you a reasonable transition period.  Everything is negotiable.  -Steve|`|AA10144492	Contact a trademark attorney definitely. You have a specific legal problem that's going to need specific legal assistance.

AA10010389	FHA was designed to help people who didn't  have enough down payment money for a conventional loan.  FHA requires private mortgage insurance to cover the lender until the loan balance gets to 80% or lower of the appraised value of the property.       If you have a lender who will give you 100% financing, you don't need  FHA.  You'll probably have a higher monthly payment, but it will all be going to principal and interest(which is tax deductable).       Also, once you are paying the private mortgage insurance premium FHA requires, it is included in your monthly payments and it is not protection for you, it is solely to protect the lender.  It is often hard to get FHA to drop the private mortgage insurance once you pay it down to 80% of appraised value.  I'd go 100% financing if it was available.  Hope this helps.|`|AA11785953	The only thing I can say about FHA that is a con is that thye charge you about $1000 in your closing osts just to get that type of a loan.|`|h1m17rStaa	FHA is a great product.  97% financing, low fixed rates, easy credit qualifying.  But, FHA charges 1.5% of your loan amount as an upfront mortgage premium.  Then you'll pay .5% annually, paying 1/12th monthly as part of your normal mortgage payment in monthly mortgage insurance.  FHA also is stricter on condition of the property, so on an older home, you might identify and correct issues that wouldn't come up with a conventional loan.    Doing 100% financing using conventional loans is often cheaper in the long run, if you have great credit.  Slightly lower rates might be available, but mainly, if you have strong credit (680 scores or higher, even 660 in some cases), you can often get lower fixed monthly payments by doing an 80/20 conventional.  This means an 80% first mortgage, a 20% second mortgage, and no mortgage insurance is required.      I just did a direct comparison between the two for a client of mine.  In her case, with strong credit, the monthly payments ended up being almost the same, however, with the FHA she put more money down, and it was about $1500 more expensive.  Not a huge difference, but enough to say that for her, it might not be her best solution.  FHA was cheaper than a 100% conventional loan with mortgage insurance though.    So, long story short:  680 scores and higher, a conventional 80/20 might be cheaper.  660 scores should look at both.  Anything below 660, FHA is likely the best deal in town.  And FHA does NOT have a minimum credit score.  They mostly just want to see that the past 12 months were spotless, and the past 24 months are pretty good on payment history.
f4c35d4729f3cfcc287328ffc6b7f9a8aa	The sale has conditions attached... could be anything from "sold as is" to owner has more than normal time to vacate.  It's just an additional page on the contract that states terms outside of what the standard contract covers.|`|h1m17rStaa	My best guess:  AS IS Addendum.  Meaning, the sellers are making zero representations about the condition of the home.  You are buying it as it is, with no recourse to come after them for undisclosed defects in that home.    This is often done in foreclosure cases, where the sellers may not have access to the inside of the home.  It could just be a beat-up old home.      This isn't necessarily bad, if you're ok knowing you're buying a home that needs work, as many people are wanting that, as a way to make money by improving the home.    But, you need a very good property inspector (not an appraisal, that's different).  A good inspector costs about $300 in most areas, and you'll typically get a 30 page detailed account of the condition of pretty much every aspect of the home.  Some things are hard to tell though, like inspecting a snow-covered roof, inaccessible crawl spaces, etc...      I could be wrong, but I'd bet a good chunk of money that this is exactly what they mean with their "special addendum".|`|AA11119593	Many real estate brokers (companies) have their own form of Contract Addendum that they require in addition to the standard form of Purchase and Sale Agreement...contains special terms and disclosures required by the company and its lawyers, and often a $250 to $500 "Professional Services Fee" added to commission.  So this means that the listing company (Selelr's agent) has such an addendum that they require.

h1m17rStaa	Every condo/townhome project is different.  The amount and extent of the common areas varies dramatically.  Age of the property is always a factor.      Alot can depend on how low the developer set the rates during the construction phase for the initial buyers.  They generally set them artificially low, to not scare off buyers.  Granted, the properties are brand new, but HOA dues must factor in budgeting for future repairs.  For example, every 10 years, the roofs get redone.  Every 15, sidewalks.  Every item they cover has an expected expiration date/repair date, and must be budgeted for.  When I bought my condo, dues were $165/mo.  Within 10 months, the development was sold out.  Within 3 years, I was paying $245/mo.  Nothing changed except the developer turned over control of the HOA to the buyers.  Buyers immediately had to reset the entire budget to match reality.    If they didn't collect enough in the early years, you have to make up for it later.  Or risk getting a large one-time assessment for major repairs if something goes wrong too early.     You have every right to attend meetings and review their budgeting.  Perhaps you could get your friends to get a copy of their HOA budget, and you can compare the two and see where your money is really going.  It's possible yours is right and theirs is too low.    But sorry, there is no possibility of giving you an "average" or "high" amount, there's simply far too many variables.|`|AA10626762	we pauy 150.00 a year, but we are in a small town....Probably depends on your area..|`|pTLcvsVfaa	Its almost impossible to answer your question because so much depends on where you live, how expensive you home is, and what benefits are extended to you from the HOA.

AA10074148	Yes it is an important part of underwriting a loan. The underwriter had a responsibility to know what your present monthly rental payment is so they can compare it with the new mortgage you are getting so as not to have a thing called mortgage shock.     If you are currently paying $875.00 per month rent and your mortgage monthly payment is gonna be 1895.00 per month then there is a tremendous jump in your new payment.    This coupled with your debt ratio will allow the underwriter to see if there is or might be a problem.    If you are staying with your parents there might be an alternative document they will use to determine this, as this might be one of the items needed to sell this loan on the secondary money market.     I hope this has been of some use to you, good luck.    "FIGHT ON"|`|h1m17rStaa	It depends on the loan product you can qualify for.    Most conventional, and even FHA loans, you wouldn't be required to show a rent history.    But if you try any type of stated income loan, they'll almost always require it.    So as long as you're buying something you can actually afford, it should be ok.|`|pTLcvsVfaa	Nope. I lived with my parents also with no rent history. Did not have any trouble with my mortgage.     If you are struggling in other areas, like low income or too much debt ,then possibly they might use it as a factor.   But otherwise mortgage lenders realize that many people live with their parents to save money. So they dont hold it against you.|`|AA11683895	Most lenders like to see some type of renting history to see that you can pay the most challenging bill of the month on time.  There are programs that let you have no prior rental or mortgage history, but they are getting harder and harder to come by.  FHA now has a bit more flexible guideline, that you do not need a rental history, and the rates are usually better as long as you have 3% to put down.|`|S4swOoyDaa	Renting history can have a factor (very minimal) for certain loans (for example stated income loans), but it's nothing to worry about.  Unless you have a bad renting history (not paying rent on time, getting evicted, etc.), it's not much of an issue.    What will be important is:    Your credit score - which you know  Your credit history  Your income and any other assets (money you've saved or invested)  Your debts    That's most likely what the mortgage professional you work with will be focused on.  You'll go over all of that once you begin the mortgage process.      Hope this answers your question.

7f69260814468e2cb9292116fd474a2faa	I think what you are getting at is, is YHOO a better buy than GOOG.  Right?    Initially I also thought about this question whether yhoo is really undervalued or not. What surprized me the most is that it offers a lot of services that are still not noticed and not given the "publicity" they deserve.    But when it comes to looking at the stock prize, its not how good yhoo is at present, its all about how good yhoo will be in future. In growth stocks people dont care if the stock is right now on a high or low but only care about its future prospects.  Yahoo's history reveals very well that whatever yahoo has in competition with its rivals is not its own products. It has reached this status with fast and numerous acquisitions. This implies that its own technology is not one of its strengths and so undermines investors' confidence in its future prospects of being able to come up with anything new on its own.  Besides this, even though it has made so many acquisitions and is a very stable company, it does not have any revenue generating stream other than online advertising which is clearly dominated by its rivals.    My point is that yahoo is neither known for its "techonology" nor for being the main player in its revenue generating business.  Unless, it creates something on its own or opens another revenue generating stream, its hard to see its price going up.    If you want to look for undervalued stocks, I'd suggest look at value stocks and not growth stocks. The whole concept of buying an undervalued stock and holding it till people recognize it applies to value stocks. In growth stocks, people don't mind buying then even if it is on a 52-week high provided it shows some bright future.     Bottom line... Don't Buy   (at least for the near term, until the earnings improve).  ///|`|AA10265897	what is ur question

Step 3: Place an order to buy a stock.  Either online or call your broker.   You'll get cheaper fees if you do it online.  I'd stay away from shorting or options til you gain further experience.  These can be a little tricky.  Step 4: Always use limit orders to buy and sell.  You won't get hit by the gap if you do.  Step 5: When you want to sell, place a limit order to sell (after the stock has hopefully gone up).  For some this is daily and for some longer term players, this could be years.

3d7034f6f80ccb280be8fcf26d641dbbaa	Because of the messes created by the so called creative loans made in the subprime industry and the lack of regulations on them the Feds got caught with their pants down on this one and now there is a rush to put a damper on the previous practices. They overreacted and now began by now putting the squeeze on all lenders mandating a higher standard of qualification before lending which meant a whole bunch of people who would of qualified under the regular lending qualification have been thrown into the sublending category and there is no money for them. In my opinion the lenders that are involved in these subprime loans are loosing on the average of $60k per loan that they foreclose if you look at all the costs involved and the opportunities lie in acquiring those foreclosures and either working with the original borrowers on a lease or buyback agrement or just selling them owner financing if you acquire them at a real price. Something like this happened back in the early 80's when the oil industry went belly up and everyone adjusted by selling everything they could seller financing.  My opinion, and opinions are like lawyers everyone has one.|`|h1m17rStaa	The subprime market is a disaster right now, as is the "Alt-A" reduced documentation stuff.      It'll settle out eventually, but there's basically no zero-down money left for anyone with weak credit.  Probably need 640-660 scores or higher, full-doc only.

Assuming you meet all the requirements of a dependent she's gets certain deductions and credits by claiming you (not your income).  You report your own income on your own return and answer yes that you can be claimed as a dependent on another taxpayers return. You have a lower standard deduction because of that - she's gets the extra $3500 deduction on her return that you can't take on yours as her dependent.  Don't be surprised if you owe though after you complete your return.         Based on your hourly rate I have to say I'm concerned you don't meet the requirements of a dependent.  If you are not under 19 or not under 24 and a full time student she can't claim you - regardless of you living with her and her paying all the bills.

I have included for you a link to the IRS Publication 501 which talks about exemptions and filing requirements.    Also a link for Publication 17.

If you meet the qualifications for either of these statuses then you would be able to be claimed as a dependent on your parents return.  If not, then they cannot claim you.    If you are under 24 and a full time student, chances are that you are a dependent of your parents.

I pay for the non-free TurboTax because then they will prefill my data from my past returns and the ease makes it worth the $20 for me.    The higher priced versions are for more complex returns and/or extra features.|`|AA11284831	The free on-line software is for people with income below a certain level and the simplest of tax returns.  The off-the-shelf software (or the pay versions on their website) are for folks with higher incomes or more complex tax situations.|`|WuDXQGBgaa	if you have a simple return to file use turbo tax online the free edition.
16vMIGPiaa	I've used Turbotax in years past and when I filed electronically, that was that; no paper forms to deal with.  Just monitor your return's status in case it's rejected for some reason and must be corrected.    I can't imagine it'd be different this year (clearly I haven't done my taxes yet...) but I do know the Turbotax form handling instructions that get printed with the "For Your Records" hardcopy are very clear.|`|QU43RZr9aa	I also used turbo tax, once you receive the "accepted" turbo tax will have a "popup" to let you know that you have something that needs to be printed and mailed, if any.  This happened to me when my 2nd state return was accepted.|`|3892ff0d005ca0e7cc3e0bb1045ba012aa	If it was accepted then you signed it using an electronic signature. All you have to do now is wait for your $$.

Not enough tax was paid in either via withholding or estimated tax payments.    I HATE getting a refund!  I'd MUCH rather have to pay a bit when I file.  If you get a refund that means that you lent the government money for up to a year or more but got $0 interest for that loan.  Bad juju, IMHO.
oiOtOD0Taa	Start with a bank account, and if possible utility bills in your name.    Don't go getting into to debt just to build credit but well managed store cards can help. Start with one, say at Target. Buy something SMALL and pay it off right away.   If you can't get one ion your own name, try to share one with someone to take advantage of their good credit (eg a parent)    Credit is built on   - payment history  - length of time you've held accounts  - the ratio of what you owe versus the limit on the card, so keep it low    It's often advised to have lots of different types of accounts - bank loans, credit cards etc etc - but I've never found that necessary. I have an excellent credit history and score with only a utility bill, 1 credit card and 1 store card in my name, and they have low limits.     Check out:  http://articles.moneycentral.msn.com/Col...|`|R1prwIuXaa	Have one of your parents either add you onto one of their credit cards as a secondary cardmember(your responsible from a credit standpoint), or have them cosign for a credit card under your name.  Just get a card with a low credit line so you can build your score and get cash back on your purchases.|`|DfIEgDbAaa	My way of building credit is using a secured credit card.  You go to the bank & deposit money into a savings account that will provide security for your credit purchases.  No one can tell this is not a standard credit card when you use it.  Just use it wisely and pay the payments as needed & there will be no problem.  If you miss your payment, it will hit your credit report just like a regular credit card & the payment along with a late fee, transfer fee, etc, will be removed from your security account reducing your credit limit by that much, so don't forget to pay.|`|m3KM6Xnvaa	The best thing to do would be to open one credit card with a low limit ($500 - $1,000) and use it once or twice, and pay of what you buy as soon as you use it. If you do it within 25 days, most of the time you will not be charged interest.     Doing this is only a good idea if you're responsible with money.    If you're not, you could open a credit account and lock the credit card up someplace, until you really need it, or are more responsible.

My wife had no problem with her insurance coverage while being pregnant.|`|UDxL7lPqaa	Does Texas have state disability insurance that covers it?|`|Jdj3lInWaa	Usually once you have a "condition" insurance companies won't cover you.  Hopefully you have some sick days saved up.  There is a medical leave of absence so you will be able to take days off, you just won't be paid for them.   congrats on the baby!  : )|`|y2ZukikXaa	Insurance is money at a discount.  You can buy a $1 million life insurance policy and it'll cost far less than $1 million dollars.  The insurance companies can do this because of the probabilities of having to pay out and insuring many, many people (that aren't all going to die at once)    So, when you want to give an insurance company a small amount of money for them to definitely have to pay out a larger sum they'll naturally decline the offer.  The blunt way to put it is you can't open a hot dog stand and sell hot dogs for $1 when they cost you $2.  It's a losing proposition.    Insurance is for unexpected events.  So, congratulations on the baby, but saving your money for the time off is likely your only option.

Call after 2 days or so to remind them who you are, that you took the test, and that you're still very interested in the position.|`|JY5Az7X1aa	When I applied for Chili's I did not have to take a test. I just filled out an application and a manager came out to interview me. But that was 2 years ago. The hiring system is now changed to a multiple choice skills and ethics test. When you go into apply the host (or manager) will hand you the test. Once you finished, the your answers will be sent to the manager who then faxes over your test to corporate and the results will be sent back as a pass or fail. It usually take a couple hours to do so.     If they didn't send to results that same day, maybe they weren't hiring. Most of the time restaurants like Chili's are not hiring for servers (they hire from within), or they are looking for a minimum of 2 year service experience.     Also, I would not recommend applying online, it seems like no one reads those.    Just to be sure call them and be sure. You'll get a more direct answer on the store you applied to.

Managed means that there is a target rate, but the nation's central bank will not get involved unless the free market rate goes a lot above or below the target.  The European "snake" was an example of managed rates.

6HdFNO2zaa	Forex Business  Foreign Exchange Currency Trading (Forex) is the exchange of money between different countries. The value of one countrys currency is constantly changing against the value of another countrys currency. Forex traders make money through buying and selling currencies on the foreign exchange market.     Online Forex trading is a nonstop cash market. It is one of the fastest growing industries on the internet. It attracts a wide range of individuals, from beginners to more experienced traders. Anyone with access to the internet, a valid credit card and with a minimum cash deposit can share in the excitement.     There are many affiliate programs. Forex trading is todays most exciting arena for investors as it offers a desirable product with mass market appeal.     How it works   Foreign exchange is an exciting market. Individual traders trade on margin. For example, a stake of just $100 gives a trader access to a deal worth $10,000 (using a leverage of 1: 100). Markets fluctuate constantly and for a margin trader every little move is magnified 100 times. And while potential profit is unlimited, the trader can only lose their initial investment  for this example, $100.     For example:      Leverage (gearing) enables you to hold a position worth up to 100 times more than your margin deposit. For example, a USD 1,000 deposit can command positions of up to USD 100,000 through leverage. If you believe that the euro will strengthen against the dollar you'll want to buy euro now and sell it back later at a higher price.     You want to buy the euro - We quote EUR/USD at 1.2501 (bid) 1.2505 (ask), which means that you can buy 1 euro for 1.2505 USD. In this example you buy EUR 100,000, at the quote price of 1.2505 USD per euro.   The market moves in your favor - EUR/USD is now quoted at Bid 1.2515 Ask 1.2519   Now you sell your euro and get the profit - You sell euro at a price of 1.2515   The profit is calculated as follows - Sell price-buy price x size of trade  (1.2515 minus 1.2505) multiplied by EUR 100,000 = USD 100 Profit

AA10464818	It is hard to find grants to start a business. Unlike the myths that some perpetuate, federal government and even private foundations hardly give grant money for starting a for-profit business.     One possible exception is for companies developing or exporting agricultural goods, including food and forest product. Another exception could be the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) or Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR)  programs http://www.sba.gov/aboutsba/sbaprograms/... , which fund the research and development of technological innovation that meets specific government needs.    Your best bet actually will be from the states if they offer grant programs for women (or any other special interest groups -- minorities, women, disabled, veterans, etc). Or check with non profit organizations, particularly women organizations if they offer grants. Examples include    Iowa Women's Foundation http://www.iawf.org/  New Mexico Women's Foundation http://www.nmwf.org/guidelines.html    Even SBA does NOT give out grants. From the SBA website http://www.sba.gov/mostrequesteditems/CO...  ------------------------------------  "The U.S. Small Business Administration does not offer grants to start or expand small businesses, although it does offer a wide variety of loan programs. (See http://www.sba.gov/financing for more information) While SBA does offer some grant programs, these are generally designed to expand and enhance organizations that provide small business management, technical, or financial assistance. These grants generally support non-profit organizations, intermediary lending institutions, and state and local governments."  ------------------------------------  Nonetheless, you can go to the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) http://www.cfda.gov and Grants.gov http://www.grants.gov - these are two sites created by the federal government to provide transparency and information on grants. Browse through the listings and see if you can find any grant that would support a for-profit venture.    Here is a listing of federal grants for small businesses. See if there is any available for individuals for starting a business -- THERE'S NONE.  http://12.46.245.173/pls/portal30/CATALO...    Most of the federal grants are given to specific target groups with specific requirements (e.g. minority business owners involved in transportation related contracts emanating from DOT - Grant 20.905 Disadvantaged Business Enterprises Short Term Lending Program     Grants are also often given to non profit groups or organizations involved in training or other similar activities (grant 59.043 Women's Business Ownership Assistance that are given to those who will create women's business center that will train women entrepreneurs|`|zuGKIWfNaa	For grant information:    http://www.grants.gov      http://www.sba.gov/    And for advice about starting up a new business:    http://www.score.org/index.html

The ONLY number that has any tax consequence it the value of any account at the time it was converted from a TRADITIONAL IRA o a Roth IRA.  Based on the title of your question, that never happened.

If you are a good risk, and have the financial ability to support a mortgage, apply for it directly.
afsvcszdaa	Interesting, I recieved an e-mail from Susan Shubangu, a deputy minister of safety & security for Africa. She was speaking of her husband passing & leaving $20,500,000 and she set aside 20% for me for my time also. I assume you got this in your e-mail?  I assume both of them are scams, but my e-mail gave me a website to go to (legit) along with all the links to click on and everything worked out the way she said it would. So I know she's a real person who works for South Africa, but I still wonder whether or not the money is a for real deal. I received an alternate e-mail address & a telephone number to reach her at.

Tu9S1WaNaa	You have to add a debit/credit card, or a bank account to your paypal account.  Then they will ask you to verify the account.  It takes 2-3 business days to do that.    When you first put a credit card or bank account on paypal, they will credit that card or account a small fee of like a few cents. Sometimes they do 2. You have to find out how much the fee was. Then you Call your credit card company or bank and find out how much the fee was. Get the exact amount of the fees and go to "confirm account" on your paypal. It will then guide you through.    You have to have a bank account on paypal to get money back out of paypal.  Also, you don't have to deposit money into paypal to pay for something.  When you do a transaction, they will just get the money from your bank or credit card.
MQJ8w56Qaa	I think you have done everything right so far.  I would immediately go and close that checking account so no further payments are deducted.  Keep all paperwork and certified mail info in case you need it in the future.    Since you did not sign a contract, they have nothing to hold over you.  Did you sign anything pertaining to them being allowed to deduct payments from your account? If so, that may have details related to cancelling and additional payments be deducted??    I would not worry about the bad credit issue. If they do try to charge you again, send them them a copy of the cancellation that they already have noting the date of cancellation. You can also use this copy if you ever need to for any future credit report issues but I do not think they will pursue this as you have cancelled and moved.|`|AA10683562	You never signed a contract so you are paying month to month?

RqQDKEVHaa	Usually, two different departments in a bank handle short sales and foreclosures. And, bluntly put, often the right hand doesn't know--and doesn't care--what the left hand is doing.    The two processes proceed in parallel. If you can get the lender to agree to a short sale before the foreclosure, fine. Otherwise, you end up with nothing.    To answer your specific question, your short sale offer probably still is good. What you need to do is contact your Realtor who then should contact the seller's Realtor and find out what the status is. A good real estate agent handling a short sale has to stay on top of the bank.    Hope that helps.|`|AA10590885	Try to deal with the lender.  With the amount of foreclosures the lenders have big stacks of nameless faceless processes to be handled - your offer could be lost in the stack. The lender has to file certain documents  in a certain time frame and a deviation from that could put them back to the first step - so they may just be adhering to the script to cover themselves - or they could be hoping for a better offer.|`|49740c9daeea677fc86801fb2b3f41deaa	It means that the bank is proceeding with the foreclosure.

There are several agencies who give Refund Anticipation Loans but they are all a complete rip off!  The interest rate is some where around 36 to 50%.  There are also other fees associated with them.  The most ridiculous part about this is if you efile with turbo tax or pretty much any other reputable agency (you can get a list from irs.gov) it is free for federal and you get your refund in 8 to 15 days.  Don't get a RAL they are right up there with Payday Loans...hopefully this administration will do something about regulating and banning them right along with Payday Loans!|`|UDxL7lPqaa	No one because returns are processed by the IRS.

Issuing of refunds has to do with IRS, getting  your return processed.  IRS takes for direct deposit up to 3 weeks to process the return. if you mail the return it takes IRS up to 6 weeks to process the return and issue the refund.  At that is 3 weeks from the date IRS receives or accepts you tax return.

33ppbrMJaa	I don't think credit unions were involved in the housing bubble and this fact alone would save them from going under. The emphasis has been on helping the big banks and, so far, it seems a losing proposition, with lenders showing a disdain for the common folks, continuing their spending habits and huge bonuses.  However, there are those who say that, if it weren't for the Bailout, the situation would be even more dire, although that is hard to imagine.    The victims here are the smaller banks. Because of the credit crunch and the overall nervousness of customers, they are suffering and hanging on by a thread.  A complete economic collapse would mean a run on the banks and absolute chaos.  That's why we should work to get a Stimulus package passed.|`|6f907a03af0aac07247dccde9c984c6eaa	You can ask the Obama administration at change.gov. and they actually answer.|`|1df791d612f017199aac2300a5a74908aa	En Mxico todos los bancos roban,  lo hacen directamente con los clietnes, pagandonles intereses muy bajos o el gobierno los apoya con el famoso Fobaproa,|`|JiUwpYSXaa	Mainly the money they have comes from their members and the membership elect a board of directors.  Since it is non-profit it does't try to make money other than salaries and other expenses.  They get audited buy the National Credit Union Association.  They balance the savings rate against lending.  Sometimes small credit unions fail but rarely then they are take over by another credit union.  At the credit union I worked, they were diligent about their lending policies.|`|WgT5l14baa	There isn't a problem with banking.  There are many banks not being bailed out.  The problem comes from many of the larger banking companies maintaining trading departments that lost a lot of the banks capital speculating in mortgage backed securities.

Some credit unions is insured privately via ASI and something else like ESI, not FDIC    Check here to see if a credit union near you is federally insured.  http://www.ncua.gov/ShareInsurance/index...    Federal regulators were preparing a rescue plan to shore up the finances of some large credit unions, using billions of dollars in new government borrowings.    The plan, involves tapping into a $41 billion lending facility that Congress made available to credit-union regulators in September. The aim is to provide help for a handful of big credit unions -- all of them institutions known as corporate credit unions that don't deal with the general public -- that have been reeling from large paper losses on mortgage-backed securities.
uGJxDDC2aa	For him to let you out theoretically he should be buying out your half that you've already paid in.   If you are willing to let that go and act as if it was just rent, than as long as he can afford to to take over the full payment - its all a benefit to him.  You essentially helped pay for his mortgage over this time and all he lost was the room that you took up.  If you expect him to pay you back for what you put in - thats another story.  Because he likely doesnt have that cash lying around to do so.    P.S. You're hot.  So don't get too stressed out.|`|9r2SBjA1aa	talk to your brother FIRST and he could give you the best answer  and im sure he would be understanding in hard times and if  that dont work try to fined a new job  good luck|`|8ae90b5d4244804d72f29cc2c4f6d3bbaa	Tell him about your cut in pay, and possible loss of job....hopefully he might help you out.    Tell him that circumstances could force something bad(i.e. default on your half of the mortgage) and that you want to try to figure out an alternative plan.    Hopefully he will understand. If I were your brother, I'd hope I would understand. his wife might be tougher.|`|C4bxnKDXaa	i think hed have to buy you out...but if you waive that and just leave it puts him in prime position. If he can afford it...and with his wife there too...I'd let you do it since once the market goes back up...he can keep all the equity to himself. You are his sister and he sees how you are struggling...talk to him....hopefully he will let you go with no trouble. If he is smart he'd do it.

He should fully understand and should comply.  why wouldn't he anyway, after all.          Like the other people said, it would be in his favor to take this on.

Give it a try, at least.|`|pDvM3213aa	The thing is, he's your brother, and it's his credit on the line too. So I think you'd be better off talking to him about it before things get really bad and you can't make a payment at all. At least now he'd know the situation you're in and can try to make things right, first. If one day in 2 months you say "sorry I can't make a payment b/c I got fired" he'd be shocked. I think he needs a heads up to see how things are gong. You will feel SO MUCH better if you talk to him!! Even if things don't go the way you'd hope, you'll feel better. And if he doesn't agree to buy your half or whatever...well, at least he won't be too surprised if the bank takes it. I think the only way he'll think bad of you, is knowing that you couldn't come talk to him about it. He might be more compassionate that you think. Good luck!!! And yea...hook it up with Joe H! lol :)|`|iMULlxdgaa	well be honest with him.

If your bank doesn't provide the service, they may be able to refer you to someone who will.

If he is reasonable he will shake you hand and say he will miss you.  Either way you can stand tall with you head up.  When he calms down he will see a adult responsible man or woman standing there.  Don't be afraid of what they may say.  It will be over one way or another and you will move on.    Good Luck    Standing up for oneself is always hard to do but much appreciated.    Kevin
xNaN3VkJaa	It takes like 6 weeks to get certified. Yes, cleaning and changing elderly is usually a part of the job. Most CNA's work in nursing homes or in home health. Some work at hospitals, as "techs" and a few make it into the Dr.'s office, but they are usually looking for nurses at clinics. If you want to become a CNA, certified nurse's aid, I would recommend applying for a job at a nursing home. Most will train the CNA's and have the state come out to certify you. You will take a written test and then a test of your skills.   If you have a serious problem with "cleaning and changing" the elderly, I would say this job is not for you. Even if you were to get a job someplace without elderly, you most likely will have to do it, at least during your training. And other CNA's and nurses do not look kindly on people that act like they are too good to do that. Just telling it like it is.     It is a rewarding career, but the money is not so good. A lot of places will have some type of program where they will help their aids go to nursing school. If you sign a contract to work for them for 2 years or so after you graduated.

Movies, Games, electronic items.  Just a few bucks a piece, again depending on the item.  Furniture sells good if it's in good shape.  Bedding.  Toys as long as they aren't junky missing pieces toys.  Those don't go for very much.  Books, paperback $.50, hardcover $1.00.  Anything that you or your parents don't use and is still in decent shape will sell.  Advertisement is a MUST.  Put fliers out and balloons and road signs that are easy to see and easy to follow.  Just don't over price stuff and bargain with people.  If there's something that's been sitting there all day and no one has bought it, someone comes up and offers you a lower price than what you have marked, take it.

rVnTnuU1aa	Employers are not allowed to give specifics on verifications of employment. That is illegal.|`|FYjf7hkEaa	IN the UK, yes.  But, you will need proof of the threat. A witness, or a tape recording of them saying it.|`|32b5862608cd641eff2b289e3a95ca58aa	That was nothing but an empty threat made by a bitter boss.  First of all...a 2-4 week notice is a professional courtesy, to give the company time to find and train a new employee...it is not mandatory.  It will only negatively affect her at the company she's leaving...not at her new employment.  Secondly...professional references are only used to verify dates of employment.  She's already accepted the new job...it's a done deal.|`|su37vnIXaa	thats so mean|`|AwAw0uiKaa	If a previous employer makes a threat in any fashion it is illegal. If she is already accepted at her new job the previous employer cannot do anything. If the employer goes out of his/her way to contact the new job and cause problems, then it is DEFINITELY illegal.|`|WXpdkbG8aa	What IS against the law is for any former employer to say, "So and so was a bad employee." By law, the only information a former employer can offer is the dates on which the employee worked. For instance the phone call would go like this..    Possible Boss: I'm calling to verify that Mrs. Doe worked for you between March 2007 and June 2008.  Former Boss: Yes, she did.    Unfortunately, there is no definite way of knowing if they will give more information than they are permitted by law. I once called a former company I worked for and said the above and they verified my work dates without any negative statements. Most employers won't say bad things.      However, I don't believe it's illegal to make "threats" about bad references.|`|4d8923629944072027bbc12052c6a2e3aa	in some states yes|`|bfxerFkeaa	no....just bad business ettiquite.|`|fL6jNee5aa	I dont see what her boss can do if she has already accepted a new job.|`|etb6a7F0aa	employers check references before they hire someone, not after.    i'm sure her current employer is trying to make the point that taking off work without any kind of notice could cost her at her new job because they might think she's not reliable, not that he would call them and tell them she's a flake or whatever.|`|AHCelSY1aa	Although not illegal to give a bad reference what he is planning on doing certainly would meet the requirements to bring legal action against him since he is purposely and willfully attempting to take away your friends livelihood.  It is only under these and a tiny handful of other circumstances that you can bring legal action against a former employer on these grounds and your friend certainly will.  Tell her to tell him in the event he dares and attempts to discredit and defame her character with his wilful misconduct to purposely attempt to take away her livelihood he will find himself in court!  Tell her to add "And I will sue you for punitive damages in addition to all other damages the courts will allow me to pursue!|`|ck4St6D4aa	Your friends boss was in his/her right to give a bad reference for leaving on such short notice.

(smart companies care about the employees)     Hope this helps|`|nGEzRQ6qaa	I'm pretty sure they legally can't say much more than "we wouldn't hire them again." Otherwise, you could sue them for libel if it their remarks cost you the job.|`|1da69de5d66630d36a6f1f05ecd687b1aa	It is against the law for the employer to give any bad reference.  They can only give title and dates of employment.  If you think they are giving bad references then you need to call the Dept of Labor and inform them of the threat.  They will call asking for a ref and if they slip and say the wrong thing they will be fined and you have an opening for a law suit.|`|dcd11iUwaa	no, i just wouldn't use these people as a reference and i would also tell the new employer what the story. im sure they will be very understanding.
DorePwVOaa	Maybe. The problem is that we won't really know without trying another system... and trying another system would be extremely costly, especially if it didn't work. Also, even if the new system was extremely simple, it would probably confuse 90% of America.

dPLkNRNuaa	Sure you can sue. You can sue for anything.     Winning.....completely different matter.     You applied for the credit card or accepted it after you were "pre- approved".    You are over 18. In the eyes of the law a grown up.     You are the one who used it.    You are the one who incurred the debt.     Not what you want to hear......but time to pull up your big girl panties and accept responsibility for your financial situation. You have to change your attitude toward money. You have one bankruptcy behind you and 7K in credit card debt.  Apparently, what you have been doing...has not been working for you.    Time to do something different.    Dave Ramsey is a financial counselor. Sort of like Suze Orman. He has a radio program that comes on mon-fri and is sometimes on Fox Business.      At any rate: his book- The Total Money Makeover is a great place to start. I also recommend you listen to a few of his radio programs.  7K can be paid off. It will take discipline and focus. But you can do it.     www.daveramsey.com    Larry Wingate's book: You're Broke Because You Want to Be is also a good literary kick in the pants.|`|Lcr9FGS1aa	no...|`|07e0cb88644693b5568498c78db082e5aa	No. You accepted them and now you have to take responsibility for paying them back.|`|1uvrkDWNaa	In a word, no.  Many times after people file bankruptcy they get flooded with credit card offers in order for that person to rebuild their credit.|`|SN9gY4Toaa	Not really...I mean you could but it would be another frivolous lawsuit.  Didn't bankruptcy teach you any lessons?  Pay them off, file bankruptcy again, or whatever and then don't get any more cards.  This is part of the reason big banks are having so much trouble...they have given credit and loans to people that really can't afford them.|`|ab2c491e6bca420e2c45c21f91d16208aa	no you took them and you used them thus your debt.|`|AA10491661	this is america you can sue anyone for anything.     got an extra $30,000 sitting around for lawyers fees? they don't work for free ya know.    so they put a gun to your head and forced you to get and use the cards?

T6ZT3A57aa	Until you are able to learn about the stock market, you should save your money in some type of savings account with a bank, earning the highest rate of interest with safety.     You will generate greater profits by investing in the stock market in the longer term. Right now there are many opportunities to buy shares that are exceptional value. However, you need to do thorough research first before you buy. Also, never invest money in the stock market that you cannot afford to lose.

But when I search for jobs on Career Builder every third page pops up a similar offer to go back to school or something. That's just part of using these websites.
ghelbcVFaa	The Japanese economy ranks  19 in the world. It has been hit by inflation, a decrease in the value of their currency (Yen) and a fear of spending. Much like we saw today in the U.S., Japanese citizens are deciding to put an emphasis on saving over spending.    The Japanese Ministry of Finance (MOF) has been one of the largest scapegoats. They, according to general consensus, lend on who knows who rather than economic factors. Actually, while never fully recovering, Japan only recently reentered a recession as defined by two quarters of a contracting GDP, also known as a GNP.    Japan made the same mistake we did, but other factors beat it down. It over extended loans to people who shouldn't have been given them at very cheap rates (sound familiar?). In the U.S. this was done as investors bought up sub-prime loans. In Japan this was done based off of land value, often overvalued due to an overvalued banking system. When one fell the other followed. A recession in during 2001-2003 further hindered the economy and they had only started to recover when the current global recession hit. Keep in mind, not just Japan, but most of the world began to feel this current economic downturn long before we did.     Unlike the U.S. Japan did not allow it's banks to liquidate assets and mark off bad investments. Sure, it's a bad point on the balance sheet when done in the U.S., but then it's gone for good. Japanese banks have been eating it for years. Additionally, stimulus packages in Japan have created more supply than there is demand. This creates inventory (also can be bad for balance sheets) that sits and sits and sits....  In a nutshell, the Japanese market, make your own opinions on why, was never allowed to return to fair value. A bubble is a bubble, re-inflating it only creates the same or similar bubble, and in time it will pop. Japan did not let the bad business models (be it banks, electronic manufacturers, car manufacturers) die. Instead they pumped trillions of dollars to keep poorly run businesses open and operating at a loss, which is very bad for a free market.     I am making no comment on our situation on this answer. If you want my comment, in some cases our current reactions are good for the economy, but you have to ask yourself, should we do it time and time again for 20 years? Japan has, and their economy shows the result.|`|MEAYNpKaaa	Good question.I hope our housing market decline won't affect the economy the way the commercial real estate crash in the 90's affected and still continues to affect the general economy of Japan.|`|IVCS3DbRaa	Perfect example of how government intervention can screw up even a great economy. We are next.|`|731762ff5b663deba6422ffbee7b6ebcaa	A major factor is demographics.  Japan has a rapidly aging population and the lowest birth rate of any country in the world.  And they are very protective of their culture so they don't allow much immigration.  So there is a shrinking workforce supporting a huge number of retirees.    Japan is not doing so bad.  The people there live pretty well, and they produce some of the world's greatest products, especially automobiles and electronics.  But GDP growth is low because the country is already well-developed, and the workforce is shrinking.|`|qWaYbxcxaa	The Japanese economy has improved, however slowly since the real estate crash from 1989. The Nikkie is still down. The economy had plunged lead by the US economy over the last 2 years.     I think you might be asking, why has not the Nikkei recovered from it's 1989 highs?    The answer is that there was no rational nor fundamental justification to be at those speculative levels, just as the NASDAQ is down about 70% from it's 2000 high - 9 years later.      The Nikkei-225 is down about 46% since it's 1 year high.  http://finance.yahoo.com/q?d=t&s=^N225    ...and down 79.89% since it's 1989 high - not far off from NASDAQ's 2000 high.  http://finance.yahoo.com/q/hp?s=^N225&a=...    It would not be correct to say:   "The Japanese economy ranks  19 in the world."    Japan is ranked as the   2 (SECOND) largest economy in the world no matter how you slice it. The IMF, World Bank, and the CIA (Fact Book) all rank Japan as  2 economy (as determined by GDP). The USA ranks  1 in GDP.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cou...    It would also not be correct to say:  "(Japan) has been hit by inflation..."    If anything, one could argue that Japan went through DEFLATION, and has barely had any growth.  http://www.indexmundi.com/japan/inflatio...    Japan's inflation rate ran about 1.8% in 2008.  https://www.cia.gov/library/publications...    It would also not be correct to say:  "(Japan) has been hit by...a decrease in the value of their currency (Yen)...."    Reality:  "Yen, Dollar Strengthen as Fed Stops Short of Buying Treasuries (01-29-2009)"  http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=2...

AA10788937	If you have credit issues (sub 700) your best bet would be a FHA loan, if you are a VET, go for a VET loan. FHA loans cost a little more to jump into, but with rates at a historical low this would be about the only time I would pay for this type loan. FHA FICO scores above 580. They dont really care about late credit card bills, just have to have a semi clean mtg history. You can get a low cost FHA loan if you want to go 15yrs.    If you plan on staying in the home more than 7-8 years you will be ahead of the game. If you have short term plans for this home 6% is a great rate.    If you have over 700 it is a shoppers market, all the bull about banks not lending is not true.    Your LTV (loan to value) is good. You should not have a problem getting refinanced as long as you are employed and your credit is not trashed.|`|O8qdCBzLaa	Look up comparable properties for sale in your area to get an idea of how much your place might be worth. You will be having an appraisal done. But, you want to make sure you have enough equity in your home before trying to refinance it.    If you bought 5 years ago, chances are you lost around 30% of the value of the home. So, it may only be worth around $80K now. And, you'll be refinancing $78.3K (your current first and second). That's about a 97% loan and your lender may not be willing to go that high.    Instead of contacting specific lenders, go through a mortgage broker. They get daily rate sheets from lots of different lenders and they can help you choose the best loan product for your situation.|`|8cf66894663c74e69b5ed17db7228d97aa	First-yes,you should if you can. There is a nice article today in Yahoo finance about just that. Your credit rating needs to be high and you should look for a rate that is at least a percentage lower than what you have. I'm sure thats a fit-you might need to just roll the first one over to get financed right now. Lenders are very picky and the home prices are so low.  Our home has gone from a value of 585,000 to about 300,000-ugh! Luckily, we are sitting tight for a bit  and don't owe that much so we are ok. Our rate is 6.125 so I'd love to refinance but we'll see.

WgT5l14baa	This is a scam.  No credit card obligation that you signed is void.  The issuer may have made some slight change in terms and mailed you a notice, but the part that says you have to pay it back is still in force.|`|m3KM6Xnvaa	As far as I know, there was no credit card law change in 2007. I could be wrong, though. As far as I can tell there was a law called Credit Card Accountability, Responsiblity and Disclosure Act of 2007 passed in the House, but I can't find anything that said it has passed the Senate and was signed into law.     That bill didn't seem to make any agreements void. It would have changed the rules for disclosure for credit card companies.    I would be leery of any company that says it can get you a right off free. You can get a charge off, which means that the credit card company has agreed to settle the debt for less than you owe (usually half.) This hurts your credit and will take at least seven years to recover from, if you're responsible for the next seven years.    You could also work with a non-profit company that will help you settle your debt. But, be leery of anyone who says they can get a credit card company to forgive your debt. Credit card companies never do that.
9Kp4nZX9aa	As with all real estate it matters what market you are in. It might be a great time to start buying condos in Florida because they have been clobbered well before the beginning of the sub-prime crisis. Other markets, like Colorado resorts, have just recently begun to get hit and may have further to fall.  Waiting until the market has recovered is bad advise because if the market has recovered so has the price - would have, should have, and could have!!  You should take in to consideration that interest rates have not been this low since the 1950's. There is also the First Time Homebuyer's tax credit of $7,500. There are also a lot of special programs available through many government agencies for funding if you meet First Time Homebuyer's criteria.  My guess is that in general now is a pretty darn good time to buy. Is is the best? Hard to say but even in the stock market very few people pick the bottom and you are going to feel a heck of a lot better off than those who bought a few years ago.|`|O8qdCBzLaa	If prices go down further, it won't be as drastic a reduction as we've seen over the last couple of years. And, prices are expected to begin stabilizing, and maybe even going up late this year or in 2010.    Also, interest rates are very low right now. That, combined with low prices, makes home ownership very affordable these days. And, there are lots of people sitting around trying to time the bottom of the market, so they can get property at the lowest price possible.    But, once the property prices level off, there will be a rush on the market that will increase demand and reduce supply. Then prices will start going up and, if you waited until then to buy, you might get outbid on every property you submit an offer on. Next thing you know, prices and interest rates are so high that you would have been better off buying now instead of waiting.    Of course, this is speculation. But, I really don't think there's going to be much difference if you buy now or next year. And, if interest rates go down more, you can always refinance. So, if you're ready to buy now, go for it. If not, then wait. There's not much competition right now. So, you can take your time finding the perfect place at the right price.|`|0191j9waaa	i suggest u wait till the economy recovered. because, when the economy become worse than now, the house price will be cheaper!    read news everyday, follow the government report about economy.   be patient!    good luck!|`|ZVoAT1keaa	It depends. It is a good time to buy a home if you have the money. My brother recently bought a home priced at $390,000 but got it for $260,000. He has a great job in Cleveland OH as an attorney. I think that if you seem to find a place that is affordable you should go for it considering it may not be on the market that long and you might not get anything better or at a better price. Considering you have good credit and a good pay I would consider looking. Good luck!
6HdFNO2zaa	Forex Business  Foreign Exchange Currency Trading (Forex) is the exchange of money between different countries. The value of one countrys currency is constantly changing against the value of another countrys currency. Forex traders make money through buying and selling currencies on the foreign exchange market.     Online Forex trading is a nonstop cash market. It is one of the fastest growing industries on the internet. It attracts a wide range of individuals, from beginners to more experienced traders. Anyone with access to the internet, a valid credit card and with a minimum cash deposit can share in the excitement.     There are many affiliate programs. Forex trading is todays most exciting arena for investors as it offers a desirable product with mass market appeal.     How it works   Foreign exchange is an exciting market. Individual traders trade on margin. For example, a stake of just $100 gives a trader access to a deal worth $10,000 (using a leverage of 1: 100). Markets fluctuate constantly and for a margin trader every little move is magnified 100 times. And while potential profit is unlimited, the trader can only lose their initial investment  for this example, $100.     For example:      Leverage (gearing) enables you to hold a position worth up to 100 times more than your margin deposit. For example, a USD 1,000 deposit can command positions of up to USD 100,000 through leverage. If you believe that the euro will strengthen against the dollar you'll want to buy euro now and sell it back later at a higher price.     You want to buy the euro - We quote EUR/USD at 1.2501 (bid) 1.2505 (ask), which means that you can buy 1 euro for 1.2505 USD. In this example you buy EUR 100,000, at the quote price of 1.2505 USD per euro.   The market moves in your favor - EUR/USD is now quoted at Bid 1.2515 Ask 1.2519   Now you sell your euro and get the profit - You sell euro at a price of 1.2515   The profit is calculated as follows - Sell price-buy price x size of trade  (1.2515 minus 1.2505) multiplied by EUR 100,000 = USD 100 Profit|`|2666e45ceda5b1f2cfab4e91f880efdcaa	For now I would either put your money in a savings account or buy silver and gold (as long as you have a safe place to keep it)|`|qQaTpnxTaa	put your  in a  saving account or cd with a local bank or credit union. when you get enough built up put it with a company like edward jones and let them help you invest your money in good solid things. don't fall for anything that seems shady and there are plenty of them out there. good luck!|`|5o77AWAAaa	Our economy might be bad, but other economies are growing. It makes a perfect opportunity to invest in other countries through investing in their currencies. Forex trading can be a good investment only as long as you know what you are doing.|`|Ch9TedMcaa	If you're looking into the long term (which I assume by your question), the first thing I would do is to establish an emergency fund, such as a savings account. A rule of thumb is to put in 3-6 months worth of expenses, such as bills and money for gas. Once you've done that, look into a ROTH IRA. A ROTH IRA will build tax-free savings and withdrawals will also be tax-free. You can begin these withdrawals at age 59 1/2.    This is the best time to invest. Buy low, sell high. You get more for your money when an economy is down, because everything is on sale. Good luck.|`|JsHG73v9aa	Forex is OK if you have the time and the risk tolerance. My personal experience is that you need to be in front of the Forex market anytime you have an open trade - that market is extremely volatile and with the leverage they give you (200:1) you can loose a lot of money very fast.    Since you are young and are just starting out, I would put my money away in short-term CD's (6 months) until the market shows that it is truly recovering. My suggestion is: unless you know what you are doing and have the time, stay out until the Dow Jones average closes above 900 for 4 weeks in a row - then it will be time to get in.
29jOOWpTaa	there are many jobs in health care and most are fairly recession proof. It depends on how long you want to go to school and what you like. Many are 2 year programs such as respiratory therapy, lab technician, x-ray technician, etc. Usually, the more your education, the better the pay. Some jobs such as pharmacist, physician, physical therapist, speech therapist require a masters or doctorate but all are in demand. Nurses are in a special area. You can work with a associate degree but better jobs such as nurse practitioner, nurse midwife, or nurse anesthetist require a masters at least.   I would talk to people in the profession and see how they like what they do. Studies should be hard on science and math is also important.

Then, keep them current for at least two years. Every month your score will improve a little. After no late payments for about 2 years, you should see an increase in your score.     During this time, don't open new credit accounts, and keep those payments current.     You can't increase your credit score overnight. You have to maintain a good credit history and demonstrate that you're responsible with credit, and therefore you're not a risk.     Also, pay attention to your credit card balances. Keep your balances low, because if you keep your payments current, but you have high credit balances that will hurt you.    Good luck.

OacSIfSiaa	Arbitration is just a fancy word for "judgment".  Many businesses have included arbitration clauses in their agreements with consumers. Frequently, these agreements are buried in a pile of transaction documents or sent as a stuffer with a monthly bill. The bottom line is that these agreements are not obvious to the consumer.  Most of the time the arbitration favors the creditor that is why they use this tactic.    After the arbitration judgment is entered, a lawsuit can (and will) be filed to enforce the judgment. Although your defenses are limited, you still need to understand what can and probably will be done to you.   Writs of Garnishment, Writs of Execution, Turnover Orders, and Abstracts of Judgment may be enforced against you. Bankruptcy may be an option. Or not. In any event, you need to visit with an attorney to see what can and what cannot be taken from you.

When you OPEN a new line of credit; not just a soft inquiry.  You get two hits; a small one for the inquiry.  But the big one is for the new line of credit.  Remember that credit score is NOT just the balances you have v. available credit, but ALSO the length of time that you have the new credit.  So your average account length just took a big average length opened "hit" when you got the new credit.  I don't know if that's the full reason for the 51 points but it can have a sizeable 20-30 point hit.  The remaining difference may be the amount of money you have borrowed v. your available lines AT the time they checked your credit.  For example, did you pay your credit cards/installment loan a little later than usual, so that your actual balances were higher.    She is also right that it will jump back up probably in about 6 months.  For example, I just got a new credit card that added about $13k to my available balances, but I have not used it yet.  I did it for the rewards, but it dinged my score 20+ points for the month it was opened, even though I have NOT charged anything yet.  It will go back up in a few months.|`|WgT5l14baa	The credit bureaus implemented a new scoring system at the beginning of the year.  Some people will have scores that are higher under the new system and some will be lower.|`|pcLLUvZ3aa	Credit scores can drop for any one (or a combination) of hundreds of reasons.      Some of the most common (and hardest hitting) are:    1. Recent late payments  2. Inquiries on your credit   3. Change in number/types of accounts  4. Change in credit/debt ratio  5. An old account in good standing has dropped off due to age.  6. Recent (and frequency of) change in address  7. Collections that pop up (though you might not have received anything yet...and it may not even be legit.)    The bureaus also change they scoring formulas all the time and that can affect your score.    The credit scoring formulas are greatly dependent upon how you manage your credit over time and are strongly stacked against someone that tries to get a credit card from everybody, rack up a lot of debt, and skip out.  Most likely, your score has dropped due to that new card not having any age/payment history on it yet.  As this becomes an "aged" account, it will give you the ability to raise your score even higher (with a good mix of number/type of accounts) than you ever would have been able to reach otherwise.      Give it 3 months and you should be back where you started -- and in 6 it's time to get another account if you need it.
ePxILvTDaa	Call your mortgage lender and have them help you with this problem. The banks really don't want to forclose on properties since they are responsible for upkeep until the place is sold. That means paying to have lawns mowed, driveways and sidewalks shoveled, heat in winter months, cleaning, etc. Call, explain your situation and see if they can work something out that will be agreeable for both parties. If you have paid your mortgage down, the bank may accept an interest papment instead of a full payment. They will be able to answer this question best since they will know what paths are available for you. Good luck.

4f3GfrN6aa	Your husband has already become a failure.  His behaviour is evidence of that.  He has an opportunity to fix things but doesn't.  So he is already a failure.  Tell him that.    Tell him if he wants a marriage, he'd better get his finances under control.  Most partnerships have one good money manager, and a spendthrift.  My partner took a lot of training, but we split the bills now (we both work) and stuff gets paid on time. Tell your partner that it is deeply hurtful to you that he does not consult you in financial matters.  Tell him you have been betrayed by him going behind your back and organising loans without consulting you, as your financial record will be affected by any delinquencies on his part.  He obviously cannot be trusted.    Tell him to sort it out, or pack his bags and tell him to move back to his parents house.  He needs some sort of impetus to change, and if he realises that his behaviour is undermining his entire relationship, he might change.  Otherwise, you may need to consider separation.  He is becoming self destructive, and that will end up hurting you in the long run.  If he cannot share this kind of information with you, and doesn't respect you enough to fulfill his duty as a husband (to be equally responsible for the family's financial welfare) then he does not deserve you.    If he doesn't change, you need to show him the door.  This behaviour is just a symptom of his disrespect for you.  You deserve better.  There is a difference between being a bit dodgy with money and forgetting to pay a bill, and deliberate deception and emotional manipulation.  This man is manipulating you by 'clamming up' when you try to discuss the problem.  That is his method of control.  So don't give it to him.  Tell him if he won't discuss it, you will leave his belongings outside for him to collect.    You are trying to do the right thing for the both of you.  If he is too selfish to see that, then you deserve someone better.  You deserve to be debt free and with someone who honours your joint obligations, both morally and financially.

q3zY2ymgaa	Funds sold by an adviser usually carry a sales charge.  The 3 basic types charges are categorized as share classes.  These are designed for clients with a specific time line.      A shares has the largest up front sales charge usually 4-6%, intended for clients who intend to hold their investment for 7 years or more.    B shares have a decreasing sales charge (called a CDSC) usually going from 5%-0% over a 6 year period before converting to A shares.  Think of it as a decreasing penalty on your purchase amount.  They have a slightly higher internal expense, designed for those holding funds from 2-6 years.        C shares have a 1 year CDSC or 1%.  So if you invest $2,000 and pull out in the first year you'll pay $20.  They have the highest operating expenses and are intended for those who intend to hold funds for 2 years or less.      You'll notice A share earns more when the time period is more than 7 years, B shares from 0-5 years.  C shares earn the least because of the higher cost, but also don't have that 5% penalty the first year.  Those penalties can be avoided by switching within the same fund family (group of funds that a specific company sells).      No load funds have no sales charges and are purchased directly from the fund company or a self directed brokerage account (one with no adviser, only online tools and a call center to help you).  They have no up front cost or decreasing penalty but sometimes have high expense ratios (the percentage it cost to operate the fund).  The downside is that if you're unsatisfied with the performance you have no one to blame but yourself.  Use a fund screener through yahoo finance or morningstar.com to make your choice.  There are asset allocated funds that have diversification built into them.  I would suggest no load funds for you since you're just getting started and most advisers won't pay much attention to a $2000 client.  They're usually commission only and you won't receive very good service.      Be prepared to commit to a fund or group of funds for a long period of time.  Just do the research and make an educated decision.|`|AA12219135	All funds operate differently.  Some are front loaded meaning you pay a premium up front  Some are back end loaded meaning you pay getting out  Some have time limits, 15 to 30 days or more.  Some have a limit based on how much you have invested.  As far as resources, you have to decide if you want diversification or go into a sector.|`|AA10259042	There are 3 types of mutual funds more or less as far as cost structures go.  1. no load mutual funds, 2. load mutual funds 3. exchange traded mutual funds referred to as ETFs and closed end funds. No load mutual funds are purchased directly from the fund companies.  Fidelity, T Rowe Price and Vanguard are among the most popular.  They each have internet sites to sign up and also to do research. Load mutual funds are purchased through stock brokers.  There are 2 options in buying load mutual funds--paying an up front sales charge of about 5.75% or a deferred sales charge. It can get complicated. Generally, these type funds, if you pay an up front sales charge have very low expense ratios, lower than no load funds. American Funds is the largest company offering these type funds.  They have a very good record. They are also on the internet.  ETFs are sold through stock brokers.  There are two types--index funds and closed end funds.  The first are unmanaged funds. They have extremely low expense ratios.  The second are very similar to no load funds with some important differences.  One difference is that they generally do not trade at net asset value as do open ended funds.  Another is that they generally employ leverage in the form of preferred shares.      Expense ratios generally run somewhere in the range of 0.6 to 2.5% of net assets annually for non-index funds and from 0.1 to 0.7% annually for index funds.  If you buy and ETF you have to pay brokerage fees to buy and sell.  If you buy a no load fund there is no fees for buying or selling.  Some have somewhat high expense ratios. Some do not.     Specifically, with American Funds even though you pay a 5.75% up front load, their expenses are so low that in 5 years time you will probably come out ahead.      Most no load funds have at least a $2500 minimum investment.  Some have a higher minimum, but those I mentioned are $2500. Load funds generally have a much lower minimum of about $500.  With exchanged traded funds you can buy whatever you want.|`|DJYmAjkPaa	There are many fund brokers out there which provides you a lot of choices on fund families, the best ones are Fidelity and Schwab. Once you find a broker, they normally have fund information, but you should also look into morningstar and Fund Mojo as 2 of the best resources to investigate on funds. Pick no load if possible, although some load fund provide better cost advantage in the long run, but you need to be very very careful on load fund. There is no lock on your money, you can sell anytime, although broker normally charge a transaction fee if you sell within 6 months.

uBTJtvITaa	I agree with Paul, shop around.  Still though, keep this in mind:  Credit and loans are tricky and you have a few things working against you.  Your age makes you a risk in terms of loans.  Your limited credit history also makes you a risk in the eyes of the loan companies.  Most banks/loan people prefer older or at least married couples because they tend to be more financially stable.  Similarly, your credit history is short (1 year) when compared to most people applying for home loans.  Simply having a credit card for 7 years in good to excellent standing for example will raise your credit score.  So, please shop around, but realize your rate will likely not be as good when compared to older, married couples with a long credit history.|`|O8qdCBzLaa	I would call a couple of other lenders to find out what kind of terms they can give you. Maybe there's something about it being for a mobile home that makes the interest rate so high. But, your calculations were correct. That loan is at about 9.5%.

RqQDKEVHaa	Couple of different ways.    Form an LLC. Then submit the contract in the name of the LLC. If/when your offer is accepted, you sell the LLC to another investor. It's just like assigning a contract, except the contract remains with the LLC; you're just selling your LLC for the assignment fee.    Another way: If it's a good enough deal, there are lenders--not precisely hard money lenders--who will lend you money for just a day. They typically charge a couple of percent. In this case, you'd actually close on the property, then immediately sell to the waiting investor. It costs you some, and--like hard money lenders--there are strict criteria regarding how much these day-lenders will lend. But that's another way.    Hope that helps.|`|k2EtMbamaa	I use transactional funding to get this done.  go to http://optionbandit.com/transactional-fu... to get the best service nationwide for your transactions.

AA11752525	Dear Matrix,                  Thank you for asking. You are correct to question any foreclosure for $200. Even in this terrible economy a personl gets what they pay for and WHO would sell a property for just $200.                   Real property typically have multiple legal claims againts them by voluntary lenders (Mortgage Holders) and sometimes involuntary lenders (judgement holders or tax authorities).                    These claims represent what are called liens. They are most paid off against property in the time order they were placed against the property. The earliest liens have highest time priority to claim the property in exchange for the debt they hold against the property.                       Lien holders are entitled to claim the property in reverse order of the time filing of liens. BUT THEY ARE OBIIGATED UNDER THE LAW TO HONOR AND PAY OFF THE PRIOR LIENS. Assume a $200 K valued home with a 1st Mortgage of $175,000, a 2nd Mortgage of $50,000 and a credit card judgment recorded against the property of $300. If you buy the credit card debt and seek to foreclose you end up with a $200 k valued home upon which you owe $225 K or a loss of $25,000.                     What you are seeing on television likely are Government Tax Liens that entitle you to purchase the property for the amount of the lien FREE AND CLEAR OF ALL MORTGAGES OR JUDGMENT.                       This is technically true and accurate. YOU ARE NOT TOLD that generally the other mortgage holders have a right of between six months to six years to repay you for your kindness in advancing payment  on their behalf at an interest rate of between 5% and 20% per annum  and that you must contact them to forewarn of your intent to take over their property with rigidly enforced statutorily prescribed warning notices property property posted and mailed. ONLY THEN YOU MUST COMPLETE FORECLOSURE AGAINST THE PROPERTY IN AN OFTEN HOSTILE COURT OF LAW THAT WILL ALL TOO FREQUENTLY FIND YOU TO HAVE FILED SOMETHING WRONG TO AVOID AN ELDERLY PERSON, A STATE PROBATE ESTATE OR A ESTEEMED CORPORATE BANKING ENTITY FROM LOSING THE PROPERTY TO YOU FOR MUCH LESS THAN FAIR MARKET VALUE.             Yes, property falls through the cracks and some people are rewarded in the same manner and consistency they win State lotteries, slot machines, office pools and Nigerian business scams. ARE YOU FEELING LUCKY. Do you have money for Attorney fees and costs that are non-refundable and non-compensable to initiate foreclosure proceedings against banks and mortgage companies with lawyers at hand ready willing and wanting to swat you like a fly. GO AHEAD... MAKE THEIR DAY!|`|O8qdCBzLaa	If someone owns a house free and clear (no liens on the property) and doesn't pay their property taxes over 3-1/2 years, the county puts a tax lien on the property. Then, anyone can come in and pay the back taxes, taking ownership of the property.    Some states, however, allow the previous owner up to a year to come in and pay their back taxes, taking the property back. In this case, the person who picked up the property for the cost of the back taxes must turn over the property and they get their money back.    One thing to consider, though, is that there is always some reason that the taxes didn't get paid or the property was abandoned. Maybe it's in such bad shape that it's beyond economical repair. Or, it's in a neighborhood that has a lot of crime and drug activity, and no one would want to buy it. Then again, there might be some kind of bureaucratic problem, where the owner doesn't realize that the taxes aren't getting paid.     But, the properties available by just paying off the taxes are usually just so undesirable that no one would want to own it or live there, anyway.|`|RqQDKEVHaa	Quick answer: Fake.    Long answer: It's possible, but very, very rare. And the infomercial you saw is for so-called "tax foreclosures," not regular foreclosures.    Don't bother.|`|ee74f3aa67efefa8e49e21be6f4ec61faa	In simplicity, a house is foreclosed on when the person that owes the mortgage, for whatever reason, defaults on and does not pay on their mortgage.  The bank takes the house back and eventually the house will go back on the market, usually at a very reasonable price.  We have a home next door to us that is worth $190,000 that the owners defaulted on.  The house was foreclosed and the current owner was able to purchase the home for $99,000!  The house needs work, but what a bargain.  Get with a good realtor and see what they can do to help you out.  Its a buyers market right now and bargains are to be had.|`|AA11420830	It is deceptive. After making the repairs on the home just to make it livable, the home is worth less than the money spent on the repairs.     There are homes that must be legally torn down because they are contaminated by meth. If you buy the home for $300, tear it down, rebuild, then try to sell it in the crime ridden neighborhood, good luck getting back to zero.    There are homes in the middle of the desert in California, Arizona, and Nevada that are worth less than $300. There are homes in the most dangerous areas of Chicago, New York, and LA that are WORTH less than $300. The real value of the home is what someone else will pay for it. If that number minus your EXPENSES is less than zero, you lose.     House foreclosures are homes that the banks have repossessed. Banks are not going to sell a home for $300 that they can get $400 for. They are not going to sell a home for $5000 that they can get $10,000 for. and they are not going to sell a home for $100,000 that they can get $200,000 for. However they will try to sell homes that are worth negative $30,000 for $300 on an infomercial or at an auction.

AHCelSY1aa	You will only be able to draw unemployment if you have worked a minimum of 26 weeks over the last 18 months.  If you do not meet the 26 week required period in the last 1 1/2 year you will not be able to collect. It does not have to be the same job.  You could have jumped around as much as you'd like.  You just must have worked at least 26 total weeks.  And to poster "BOSSCAIN"  I am so sorry you got screwed.  You can collect unemployment although you worked for temp agencies.  They act as your employer while you temp for them and are required to pay the same taxes towards your SSI, SSDI, etc... as if you were employed at any permanent job.  Maybe you were denied because you did not meet the 26 week requirement or maybe they did to you like a recent client we have where they convinced the client she wasn't eligible.

Once you have set up an account with a stockbroker, you simply choose the share that you want to buy and make the transaction (the deal) either on line or by telephone.  If you do not know which shares to buy and want some tips, there are many websites that can provide you with information (www.H-L.co.uk or www.citywire.co.uk).     If you want advice on which shares to buy, a stockbroker will normally only do this if they look after a large portfolio for you, typically 100,000 and above.     If you have less than this it might be worth considering investing in unit trusts.  This is a way of investing into the stock market with smaller amounts.  A unit trust will invest in a number of different shares with different companies, also meaning that not all your eggs are in one basket.

M9iO7Q0Eaa	Make it public.    I've had resumes on monster.com for years and years. All that I get from it is a lot of spam email (due to email showing) and occasional annoying calls from weird places saying I "fit what they're looking for". Usually it's a marketing place, though.    If you don't make it public...employers can't find you and they'll only see it when you directly apply to a company. However, making it public gets you TONS of calls from legitimate opportunities. I don't know how many recruiters from staffing companies and regular companies have called me due to finding my resume on careerbuilder and monster.com. Hundreds, if not thousands. Make it public. It's not "that" much info. The only people who can see it when you make it public are employers/companies signed up for monster (it costs them a pretty hefty fee to look at a certain number of resumes, so most scammers don't sign up for it). It is NOT available to say, other random job seekers posting their own resumes and such. Only employers and companies can see it. It's not possible for "anonymous" people just browsing the site to be able to see it, either. You have to pay a good bit to review resumes. I think it's in the hundreds of dollars to review a certain amount of resumes. One plan might be say....$500 to look at 300 resumes. One might be...$700 to look at 500 resumes.

AA11589320	You speak about a fake hoodie.     I assume your claiming it was advertised as an XYZ brand but upon receiving it you found it was maybe a cheap brand and maybe it even had some XYZ labels/name attached.   But what ever it was,  it was not an XYZ brand hoodie.        -=-=-    Its normal practice to issue a refund after the buyer returns the item.  This allows the seller the opportunity to examine the item. He is not obliged to refund if you have damaged  or maybe soiled it or not yet sent it back.         Once he is happy that all is OK he should refund.     He sure wont refund if you don't return it first.     To protect your self you could use some sort of shipping that requires the receiver to sign for it.  That way there is a record of it getting to them.  In addition, you could also take some digital photos of it as you wrap it up. Be sure to photograph all surfaces, inside and out.  Next it going into the packaging and you closing it up.  All show it was clean and not damaged.    That way if he was to claim it is dirty, you can explain that you have several photos showing it was OK when packaged. Have them send you photos of the dirt and compare this to yours.     So in sort. The only way to know it arrived is to pay a little extra and have them sign for it upon arrival.

It's either that or you had income from sources other than your job (interest, dividends, self employment income, etc.) from which no tax was withheld.    You should probably submit a new W4 to your employer so that less is withheld from each check this year.  That way, this won't happen again.    Also, you may owe a penalty for being under-withheld.  Be sure you check into this.|`|zWy5zOhyaa	Talk to a Tax consultant. How do you expect users on Yahoo to answer such a general question.

JsHG73v9aa	Yes, you need a margin account normally called Reg T Margin account. If you have over a $100,000 balance, you will not need Reg T Margin. You can borrow up to 50% of your balance to short stocks. But beware, if the price rises on your stock and your margin requirements cannot be met, you will be hit with a margin call and will have to buy back your shares at the market price. The margin requirement changes everytime the price of the stock changes. It is possible that your account cannot pay the margin call and you will have to send a check to your broker immediately to cover the margin call. Very risky thing to do.    A bit (actually a lot) safer is buying Put Options on the stock, if it is optionable. At least you risk will be limited to the price of the option - always much cheaper than actually buying or short selling the stock. Check out the education section at http://www.optionsxpress.com.|`|AA10566552	You will need a margin account.  There are some short ETF's available that can be traded in cash accounts, but you will need a margin account to sell individual stocks short.|`|AA12219135	You can do it with cash and they will also give you a margin.  Margin is allowing you credit basically, allowing you to trade for more than you have.  i.e. margin at 2:1 means you can have twice the value of your cash invested.|`|P2PNqOJlaa	I'm fairly certain that you need a margin account. The proceeds you receive from the short position plus additional cash will be held in the account as collateral. By the way, you will earn an interest rate (the "rebate rate") on the cash balance - the rate will be below that you would normally earn and could actually be negative for very hard-to-borrow stocks.
2xaVpnNNaa	im pretty sure, there is some way to make that happen.    rather than have such a big old bailout, why not just bring those jobs back.    why must america look out for all other countries. the one problem with being a capitalist country is that you can legally betray your own country.(as you put it, which, nonetheless really is true).    it would be nice to restore some hope but our gov't is too corporate. and corporate america, does not care for the people that MAKE america. they just care about greed.    its greed of the people and greed of the gov't that is going to kill this country.    i do like the idea of taking the homeless and those on welfare and putting them into those jobs. chances are if you are in that position, you have no room to be picky.    maybe also, have some kinda treat or something, to get people motivated to work in factories.    its sad seeing american jobs being stolen by foreigners. and then what is left here, is being stolen by illegals.    where does it end?????|`|pcLLUvZ3aa	You can't get decent labor in the US for any kind of a reasonable price to make anything affordable.      So you call, for example, DELL tech support and get somebody in India with a thick accent reading from a script.  Let's imagine you paid $500 for that computer you're calling for tech support about setup or something (whose parts weren't made here either, by the way...).  Would it have been worth it to pay $1000 for that computer to have an American give you the run around?  That's probably what it would cost to have totally American tech support.  How about $600?  For the $100 difference, you could hire someone (local) to come answer your questions.      How then, could a company like DELL survive (who does provide lots of American jobs) if their computers were $1000 and the competition were selling the same thing for $500?  They would crash and everybody would buy Toshiba.    It's all about sacrifice which is often thankless, but completely necessary.  The question to you then is, would you work for minimum wage for the rest of your life?  Come on...it'll be good for your country's economy.      Yeah, me neither...but let's imagine you're such patriot, you would work for minimum wage so that companies could afford to manufacture here (which probably wouldn't happen even a minimum wage...but it would be a lot closer than market labor rates now).     Let's take a look again at the DELL outsourcing tech support referenced earlier.  What if they went all American and their prices shot to $1000 as compared to Toshiba offering a competitive product at half price or $500.  What would you buy when you're standing there in the computer store?  (REMEMBER - You're only making minimum wage and can barely afford to eat!)      You'd obviously pick the $500 Toshiba over the $1000 DELL.  That's just common sense.  Even with a big sign that said "100% Made In America", you'd still get that 1/2 price Toshiba laptop.  You know it.      You could get stricter with welfare now.  Make it a 1 year deal.  If you haven't found a job in a year - cut the welfare off and don't let them apply again for another year.  If we could get everyone on welfare to work every other year we'd save BILLIONS!    We could also legalize prostitution between consenting adults which would bring in TRILLIONS to the economy.    Legalizing marijuana (for growth and in-home use only) would cut down on crime and violence immensely because most of the violence comes from criminal organizations fighting over territory.  It's a PLANT - you can grow it in your house and it therefore can't be taxed - so it wouldn't greatly benefit the economy, but it would keep TRILLIONS of dollars from flowing overseas to criminal and terrorist organizations (like the poppy fields in Afghanistan).      If we could get Hollywood and the TV producers to glamorize the poor and hardworking lifestyle instead of Paris Hilton and the like, maybe the attitude of the country would change from instant gratification to hard work.      Anyway...I'm ranting.    I really hope you get a chance to study world economy.|`|49740c9daeea677fc86801fb2b3f41deaa	We really can't afford to do that.   The unions drove wages up so high that they put the factories out of business.   Look at what they have done to the auto industry.    I would love to buy American, but I am not willing to pay for the outrageous pay for uneducated labor that our country demands.    The jobs were out sourced because the labor is too high here.    What are you expecting Big Brother to do?    Force factories to build things no one can afford to buy?|`|AA10253095	I agree with you, we need high tariffs on foreign goods and we need most products sold in USA to be made in USA.

cLtzGveRaa	Yes.  An installment loan is a fixed amount borrowed with a fixed payment over a fixed period of time.    You don't necessarily have to put up your own money as collateral, but it will make it easier to get the loan if your score is marginal.|`|0yqQg9CXaa	There are ways you can get 800+ scores without ever paying a penny interest.  I am proof.  Open a checking account - after 6 months in good standing ask them for a credit card - easy as pie.  You will need a job for 6 months - which I'm sure you already have.    If you are desperate for credit now, consider asking your local bank (where you have your checking) to offer you a secured card.  /|`|Pjm9pg7iaa	It is a legal term.  Some loans for $1,000 have no payments. You just agree to pay back the money in 6 months.  An installment loan for $1,000 has monthly payments to repay the loan. You are paying in regular "installments".  Either type of loan can have collateral. The lender decides if collateral is needed.  Go to your bank and ask for a $500 loan. You will pay it back every month until it is paid off..
Vq8Szjs9aa	Paypal is good for purchasers, but risky for vendors (you).  Personally, I hate it.  If you're shipping to an unconfirmed address, paypal does not protect you in the event of fraud.  Problem is, many buyers have unconfirmed addresses.  The system is supposed to be safer than credit cards, but I personally believe it is exactly opposite.      For what it's worth, I do accept both (since some buyers insist on PayPal) and about 95% choose credit cards and maybe 5% choose PayPal.    If you're concerned about the cost of credit card processing, I can recommend a hosting company that will not charge you per transaction fees or discount rate per transaction.  However, the hosting package will run you $80 per month - this includes the shopping cart and  unlimited credit card transactions (you can also accept paypal in the shopping cart).  Oh, it also includes the cost of the hosting company customer building your website.  If  your CC transactions will be significant, this can be a great money saver.    Message me if you want more info.  Good luck.|`|v0BvbOOSaa	As a customer, I would feel more comfortable using Paypal rather than give you my credit card number especially if you are a small company I've never heard of before.|`|6sPcYQr0aa	The fact is that it wouldn't hurt.  I say go for it, not much to lose but could gain a heck of a bunch.|`|cdt4F6ZWaa	Oh, definitely.  It is a way for your customers to instantly buy something, which is what you want!  I do think customers do feel more secure going through pp, rather than taking a chance on say, some other payment systen on your brand new website, which they may not think is secure. I have been using my paypal account now for a couple years and I think it's great.  They are very secure and I haven't had any problems with them at all.  In fact, I think ebay now requires all payments through paypal.  Paypal has lots of learning tools too.  Good luck!!|`|f0NFwXxwaa	Hi,         Yes pay pal is great and once you are a verified member then that adds value to you and your business as someone trustworthy online to do business with.

By having a secure checkout screen you give your customers piece of mind without the hassle of their needing to make a paypal account. Good luck!

To an employer a candidate who has been out of the field for a few years is most likely not up to date with the current trends and technologies or might be "too rusty" to perform the job duties as well as someone with more recent experience. btw...the going rate for admins experienced or not in my area is $10/hr, more for those who have current advanced skills.
0yqQg9CXaa	With that much credit card debt, you might not qualify for a low interest loan.  You might still see yourself paying 8+% interest.

Your home loan interest is deductible|`|1df31c9db3dcca4d09a9e2c45066a64caa	In being a homeowner myself I'd choose to take the money and pay off the revolving debt as that has accrued interest that can be higher percentage wise than the rate for the mortgage you have. To refinance means that you'd end up starting with a new home loan and a longer time then for the house to be paid off later on. To need that much upfront to pay for the downpayment is absurd I feel. I didn't pay anywhere near that much in closing on my original home loan. The longer you take to pay off the revolving debt now the more interest they will end up taking out of you in the interest added on in minimal monthly payments only. I would not want to have that linger and build up especially in a time of recession now.

So in my area only $5.55 would be saved.     As for safety, The extension cords would not provide enough power for your home safely.  It is probable that you would trip you're neighbors breakers, or even start a fire in your home or that of you're neighbors.  Additionally unless the power were ran in conduit, underground, there is also the possibility that the cord could get damaged by outside forces.

If you can not go, send them the information they need to prove it is you.   One of my friends got $55 for a car she bought 5 years ago. She had overpaid the tax by that amount.  The dealership had mailed the check twice to an old address. After 2 attempts they turned the money over to the state..
Pjm9pg7iaa	When people apply for a loan for their business, they are quick to provide a balance sheet. It looks good.   The bank wants to look more closely at the operations of the business. The bank looks at the income statements. They want to see if the company makes 50% of its profits at Christmas (many companies do) or if it makes steady returns all year long. Since the loan has to be paid back every month, the bank is looking for signs that the money might be in short supply at different times of the year..|`|zuGKIWfNaa	Um. Pretty much what it says -- that a balance sheet shows the company's status as of the date of the balance sheet, but the financial statements show the status over time.    I can't really think of a simpler way to phrase it.|`|kEPuRQRVaa	It means that if someone is asking you to make a judgement on a companies position from a balance sheet alone, you should be very wary as they often deliberately do not reflect the full picture. Income statement on its own is useless without corresponding expenses for the period.    Hope this helps, from http://www.commercialfinance.org.au  -finance problems solved!
AA12206708	annualcreditreport.com    You can get a free credit report from each reporting agency.  Space them out quarterly and you can spread them out over a year.    Credit scores are another matter.  You have to sign up for memberships (trial or otherwise) to get a score.  However, myfico.com and bankrate.com have fico "estimating" calculators that will come close to credit score if you are honest with the options.|`|cwKNDZz9aa	It depends on the state in some cases.

M9iO7Q0Eaa	I've been hired for 4 different jobs by applying online.    They DO check them. When you say a number of locations for the same store...you mean a number of positions within the same store?    For a lot of them, you have to apply to each store individually, unless it allows you to apply to multiple stores for multiple positions all at the same time.    Most of the places I was hired at were retail stores, of course. Home Depot, Office Depot, etc. let you make a "profile" and store it on their site. Then you use the saved profile to apply to whatever positions at whatever locations you want, without having to re-enter all of that again.    Others, like Best Buy, PetSmart, Petco, and just about every other grocery store kind of place...usually ask you to type in your zip code. You pick the one you want to work at. Usually they let you choose at least two positions in the same application (if not more)...and then any other locations/positions you want to apply at, you have to fill out another application.|`|NfpN1Fyuaa	Well I pretty much agree with everything the person above me is saying.    That said, don't waste your time with radioshack.  I'm there now and trying everything in my willpower to get away.

It could also be a pyramid scheme, where you bring in other people and get a piece of their sales.  These are illegal and eventually collapse. In either case you are correct in seeing a huge red flag flying.  You need to elevate your self esteem and self-worth.  I say that because you shouldn't have left the interview without requiring them to disclose the work.   I would either write them off, or make a phone call and ask point blank to describe the position.  If they refuse, don't waste any more of your time on them.  Treat time as if it has value, because it does.  Good luck.|`|gUhve1dHaa	Tell them to shove it.  If they won't tell you what they sell then they are not worth working for.

Customer Service, and you're an associate. In all reality, all workers that are not managers are Customer Service Associates. It's a basic job title for sales/food services positions, except for "cook," of course.    - Processed orders on the POS and counted register tills. (Point-Of-Sale, meaning Cashier...many places prefer to use POS - it's a more professional term. You don't have to list "made change to customers, etc."...that is a given with POS cashiers.)    - Provided Customer Service to Drive-Thru and Walk-In customers.    - Maintained cleanliness in all work and customer areas.    - Cleaned cooking equipment in order to meet company regulations and provide a safe and clean food environment.

Y7l9w11Maa	Wow, it sounds like you were dealing with some pretty "scammy" people.  Sometimes.. if a LL wants to sell a property you're renting, they will offer you some sort of 'penence' to go through all of the trouble necessary to sell the home (i.e. temporarilly lower your rent etc).    However, the thing I noticed is you said the house *SOLD* which means your new LL is not the same people who were trying to put the shakedown on you before.    These new people bought the house with the idea it had really nice people as tenants (they probably met you when they came to view the property) who would pay their rent and not cause problems.  If you don't pay your rent, or only pay for 1/2.. you're only hurting the new owners who have done absolutely nothing to you.     These new owners now are also the owners of your security deposit.  They should return it to you when you move out and the conditions of the property are satisfactory (I'm assuming it will be =) if they do not - you could take them to small claims court.  However, if you don't pay your full last month's rent they could legally take it out of your security deposit anyway.    I wish I could tell you you had something to sue the pants off the previous owners for because they sounded like real NIGHTMARES... but unfortunately, I'm pretty sure there isn't.  And you were *SMART* not to give them any money.  My understand is.. a lease "option" is just the right to buy the home down the road.  It's not money going toward the purchase of the property.. It's like a bribe almost.  "Give me $500 dollars and I will offer you the option to buy the home in the future."  $7000.. and especially $14000 is extortionate!!  That $ does not go toward the down payment.. it's just a bribe that says the owner cannot sell to anyone else.. and also, if you don't pay it off in 1-3 years it becomes invalid and that $ is non-refundable.  Also, the guy probably wouldve taken your money and took off by the way he sounds in his business transactions.    Sorry about your situation.. but don't screw over these new people because the previous owners were jerks.  Give them a fair shake, and good luck to you... maybe your next rental will be a better experience - or better yet.. maybe you could look into buying sometime in the future.|`|d07683f385c8c5d34bcf9ca4a532395faa	I love how you say they are THOSE KIND OF PEOPLE and you don't even know if they plan on keeping your deposit or not.  Have you thought about what you are doing only paying 1/2 the months rent.  Pay your rent in full and fight them in court if they dont return your security deposit.|`|vCePK8gMaa	The facts are:    You are a tenant. The landlord owns the house and can put the house on the market.    The landlord or his agent has the right to enter to show the house with proper notice.     You do not have the right to pay only half the rent - you can be evicted and sued. You will lose. The landlord has the legal right per the landlord tenant laws of your state to put the house on the market and show it to potential buyers.    You do not have any right to make any demand for the security deposit until after you have moved out and received your security deposit accounting.     Pay your rent and move out. If the security deposit is not returned or you feel the deductions from the deposit are unfair, take the proper action via Small Claims court.|`|dPLkNRNuaa	Unless your lease says that in exchange for showing the property you get a reduction in rent....then landlord can sue you. The landlord will win.    You can't make a uni-lateral contract.     Unless there was an agreement up front with the landlord, you don't have a leg to stand on.
Vbgrb7U6aa	Absolutely not. You're a teenager. Nobody expects you to have any relevant job experience.     Even when you get into your post-college 20s, employers don't really expect you to be the pinnacle of your profession.     You are far too young to be worrying about not having job experience. As a 25 year-old college graduate/writer, I would recommend starting small. My first job was as an umpire when I was 13. Employers who frequently utilize teenage laborers want to know that you're not immature or irresponsible. Giving your word that you're willing to learn the job, take direction and give 100% is pretty much all you'll need to do. I'd recommend taking a look at some jobs in your area, such as in your school's office to see if they need filing help, at some local law firms or doctor's offices to see if they need filing/administrative/receptionist/mail help, at local fast food restaurants for cashier/cook/drive thru help, or any other place that looks for high school students.     Try careerbuilder.com and look up "student", "high school" or other words that might filter out your search in your area.    Best of luck to you. I understand it's much harder for kids to find jobs these days than ten years ago.|`|Mq2TICVmaa	No you're not screwed. Don't make anything up because employers might check up on it.  Write a list of your interests and hobbies, and see what you've learnt from them. Write those down as skills. What about chores around the house? That's giving you skills with general cleaning, cooking, etc.   Just anything that could be considered a skill; talking even! That would go under communication skills. Computer skills are also really good.   Best of luck!|`|QtC9fEodaa	Have you ever helped out your grandparents, cousins, or other relatives with chores or any work?

Do you have a special talent?  Are you taking any difficult classes?  Are you pursuing any difficult hobbies?  Have you ever helped out someone else with their homework?  -You could put tutoring  Do you play any sport?  Are you the leader of any club?  Have you been nominated for something?

[you'll probably just need to fill out an application]  The lesson to learn here is that when you start your first job, keep tabs on what you have accomplished, with actual data.  Example, don't put that you "were the assistant manager at Good-Burger", put that you "managed 12 employees on 3 shifts in a customer-service and production environment", and list real accomplishments like "reduced wastage by 15% by implementing an improved inventory program".|`|OOL4XdjPaa	lol sounds like it..    you've never volunteered at anything?

Emphasize on your education and attendance.  Also mention responsibilities at home, cooking, dishes, house cleaning, etc.  If you can, hand your resume straight to the manager, and show an eagerness to learn the job.  Of course a professional appearance is important too.  Good Luck!
e7e1924d8971698b40672960f27475f5aa	First, don't assume your planned vacation is a problem. It's common rto start with an upcoming vacation planned, and rarely considered an issue. (Your friend was right when she suggested you not bring it up.) Here's an additional idea. The economy and job market being what they are, there is a reasonable chance you won't get offered what you want, compensation-wise. At that point, almost everything is negotiable. If they want to start you at one week of vacation, push for two -- get your trip in May as a "freebie." Good luck!|`|kCt1SL5Zaa	If they really want you and you are truly worthy of the job, they should be amenable to your plans.

You are a valuable commodity!!!|`|LBQ50RnKaa	ok so if you actually do get the job when you talk to your new boss ask him about your hours your pay and etc.  so just ask him/her if you get any vacation time (dont tell them when you want to take your vacation just ask how long of a vacation can you take) and they usually give you a week or 2 of vacation, so when your trip comes up just tell your boss and and that would be your vacation time|`|7toznquyaa	Wait until you have the offer on the table.. and then accept it..  Once accepted, mention to them that you had already booked a non-refundable trip in May, and hope that won't be a problem.    Assure them that you are a professional, and that you wouldn't leave your post without tying up loose ends and that you would be available for emergencies if need be.    I've done this several times.. if they want you.. they will accept the fact.   I actually worked only 3 days before taking a week off  my last position.  It's part of having a life.    Assure them that you are not looking to be paid for this time.. just the courtesy of being allowed to enjoy your time off.

Then you owe them some service time.  You'll have to get your Masters and Ph.D. on your own.  You might be able to get some form of tuition assistance, but I think even that is just for your first degree.    Other than that, good plan - though if you don't manage the extra degrees, you might have to scale back a bit on your post-Navy career.    As a ROTC grad, you'd start as an Ensign and work your way up the officer ranks.  You can look up the pay scale anywhere.

7HKTDcvYaa	If this home is in Canada, you may prefer to avoid doing that.  In Canada you do not get tax relief for interest paid on your mortgage. But when your home sells for a large capital gain, there is no capital gains tax if you can claim it as a principal residence, meaning that you never rent it out.    At this time, an American can sell a vacation home and  just pocket the capital gain, with no information going to IRS.
4UBxVIYFaa	Foreclosure has nothing to do with your lease contract.  The lease remains valid until the property comes under new ownership.  There need be no contract language for early termination.  You are still bound to the lease until its expiry.    If this is an apartment building, you probably have no worries, since the lender who takes possession will be more than happy to have paying tenants until the place is sold to another investor.  Generally, you only have concerns about foreclosures when living in a single family property.|`|49740c9daeea677fc86801fb2b3f41deaa	You're good, as long as there are more then 4 units the bank has to hire a manager until they sell it.

Bw1h5xAcaa	Medical residency takes places after you graduate and hold the MD. It's more like a supervised training period.    Student nurses don't get paid because they are still in school, and do not yet hold the license. Nurses can get paid if they get a student nurse internship during the summer months before the last year of their program.|`|9olha1dKaa	You may be confused with med students. In the final two years of med school, students do rotations between specialties such as peds, psych, EM, ortho, OB/GYN, radiology, etc. Students do not get paid. There is the exception with the military, since med students in the military are officers, they are paid according to rank.    Upon completion of med school, they are conferred with doctorate degrees in medicine (M.D.). They do not have a full license yet, it is restricted. Consider it a Learner's permit for driving. They are employed by the hospital, therefore, they are paid. It's not a lot of money, but it's enough to meet the minimum monthly student loans and a shared apartment with other residents. Upon completion of residency, they have full non-restricted license. A doctor may decide to break out on his own, remain employed at the hospital, or do a fellowship which is additional training for 1-3 years.

As a manager, the way I look at it, when one of my employees kicks a@@, that's great for everyone -- me, the employee and the company. Recognizing, encouraging and nurturing that talent ... that's my job. When someone surpasses or eclipses me, there is no better proof that I'm good at what I do.

For example, you can get an effective "low" interest loan by depositing your $5k as a CD with your bank and then borrowing against it.  There is a spread they will charge you (perhaps 1-2%) above the CD rate for your loan.  Then you pay them back based upon the terms you agree to.

So over the past couple a years, I ended up running up a ton of debt (partying, girls, clothes, ya know) and didn't have a good job to pay this off. On top of that, I had my rent and car payment to worry about. I was working at Foot Locker making like $10 bucks an hour, so I needed to find a way to get some money.    I started to do some research and found out that a ton of government money is given to 'minorities' each year. The money can be pretty much used for whatever you want as long as you fill out all the info they need (your name and address, what you want to use the money for, any school you been to (i only finished high school)). I told them I wanted to start my own clothing line and needed to pay off my debts first and that was it. After a few weeks I got approved for a government scholarship.

Have they contacted their local charity associations or Dept of Human Services.  Sometimes you can get help for one month if you can prove extinuating circumstances.    I do believe that he has to have the heat fixed.  He is not entitled to collect rent on an apartment that is not habitable.  However, they chose to stay there without the heat.    Can he rent the apartment while they are still there?  I believe that he can start the process of re-renting.  If they catch the rent up before the eviction comes through, then he cannot rent it.

RbdPDXQNaa	If you are good at giving advice and helping people solve their problems there are a lot of fields you could go into.  Psychology is one field; however, realistically it can be hard listening to people all day and giving advice they don't take.  Other fields you may want to research would be occupational therapy, rehabilitation counseling, social work, school counselor or school psychologist.  You can help people in many ways, I think you need to ask yourself what you would want to do on a day to day basis.  Do you want to listen to how people "feel" about their problems everyday as a psychologist?  Or do you want to help people resolve their problems by tangibly working through them?
Au2aI9a2aa	First thing i noticed in your question is that you hardly have any renters history. Does this mean you have none or do you have one rental history?  Well aside from the rental history you also indicate that you do not have the best of credit history.  Let me make one thing clear for you. No credit is better than BAD credit.  If you are moving out for your first time and you do not have a rental history do not worry about that. Because everyone will move out sometime in there life. If you are worried about not having credit do not worry about that. Relax and have fun finding a nice clean apartment to live in that is within your budget.  For the rule of thumb it should not exceed 30% of your gross pay.  Best of luck|`|TpMvr1pyaa	U rent some where now and you want to move to a condo.

The value of one countrys currency is constantly changing against the value of another countrys currency. Forex traders make money through buying and selling currencies on the foreign exchange market.     Online Forex trading is a nonstop cash market. It is one of the fastest growing industries on the internet. It attracts a wide range of individuals, from beginners to more experienced traders. Anyone with access to the internet, a valid credit card and with a minimum cash deposit can share in the excitement.     There are many affiliate programs. Forex trading is todays most exciting arena for investors as it offers a desirable product with mass market appeal.     How it works   Foreign exchange is an exciting market. Individual traders trade on margin. For example, a stake of just $100 gives a trader access to a deal worth $10,000 (using a leverage of 1: 100). Markets fluctuate constantly and for a margin trader every little move is magnified 100 times. And while potential profit is unlimited, the trader can only lose their initial investment  for this example, $100.     For example:      Leverage (gearing) enables you to hold a position worth up to 100 times more than your margin deposit. For example, a USD 1,000 deposit can command positions of up to USD 100,000 through leverage. If you believe that the euro will strengthen against the dollar you'll want to buy euro now and sell it back later at a higher price.     You want to buy the euro - We quote EUR/USD at 1.2501 (bid) 1.2505 (ask), which means that you can buy 1 euro for 1.2505 USD. In this example you buy EUR 100,000, at the quote price of 1.2505 USD per euro.   The market moves in your favor - EUR/USD is now quoted at Bid 1.2515 Ask 1.2519   Now you sell your euro and get the profit - You sell euro at a price of 1.2515   The profit is calculated as follows - Sell price-buy price x size of trade  (1.2515 minus 1.2505) multiplied by EUR 100,000 = USD 100 Profit|`|f3399027b56ee13ae52644ed29eca245aa	Invest in a company where the nations economy is strong and businesses are monopolized such as Realm Energy (Malaysia).    http://resb.net/
32xabB4oaa	When you meet with clients its good to know what your getting into.  Simple rule of thumb, if you don't know who your dealing with, where your going to be, or what you might be getting your self into, its best to go with business casual (no jeans).     In all other situations, tailor your appearance to the client (situation). Now this may sound like a lot of effort but it really isn't, after all I am a guy who is too lazy to even comb my hair. If I am meeting with a client I am familiar with in a relaxed setting I sometimes just wear something comfortable. At work I wear slacks/jeans w/ a collared shirt (there is no dress code, i just set my own standards) There have been days where I wear hose slippers. On the days I know something is happening, or clients/corporate is visiting, I will be sure to dress up and look presentable. On the occasion I have to meet with a new client, whom I need to impress, i will wear a suit. Now, we are graphic designers after all so when i say suit, i do mean in a way that makes me look like i know something, you want to stay away from the office look. Its better to come off trendy rather than "car salesman"    Flat shoes? If you like them and are comfortable wear them. If you feel more confident in something taller that's fine too. However, I would recommend pants with stilettos.    I would recommend staying away from jeans altogether. In friendly company perhaps but not meetings. Formal suits are okay, but only if you know everyone is wearing one. You don't want to be the one who formal if nobody else is. In this field it is easy to over dress. Closed shoes are safest bet, but wear comfort. Its better to feel comfortable and confident rather than inconvenienced. I would keep jewelry to a minimum. if you have something that compliments your outfit that's fine, go overboard and people will question.    In short, "business casual with intent," but keep it comfortable. The last thing that should be on your mind in a meeting is thinking about what your wearing. You don't want to become self-conscious, you are there promote your ideas. reflect your values in what you wear. If your business is in banking wear formal, if you sell cars wear something cheap (cheesy) if your a graphic designer, reflect what you stand for.     Hope this helps,  Best of luck|`|htSZsds7aa	Try to look professional, with a modern twist. Maybe a dress jean, with heels,no open toed shoes. ankle boot is good, a tailored shirt, and nice business jacket. Keep jewelry simple. Keep your lines clean, nothing too fluffy, ruffly, too pink, or bright. You could add a nice silk scarf(the long ones) and no lo cut shirts that show cleavage....but not totally prudish. Leave a little to the imagination.  You want the potential client remembering you, not your outfit.

HUlYUWpoaa	Your personal auto insurance will not cover you if you are providing transportation of others for hire/pay.  You need a commercial auto insurance policy and the rates are much higher.  You may also need a chauffeurs or commercial drivers license.      Also finding customers should not be that hard as this is a service many senior citizens could use.  Advertise in local paper, contact local physician offices, put up flyers at senior centers, churches, restaurants etc.     Private insurance companies do not pay for transportation services. I do not know about Medicaid but you could probably call the local Medicaid office and have them direct you to the proper person/place to talk to about it.
0yqQg9CXaa	My bank charges 6 months interest to take money out of a cd early.  Be careful with bank cd's, when they expire you might have to notify them by mail that you want the funds to be solvent and not reinvested.  A lot of people fail to do this, and take out the money paying 6 months interest.  Write down on your calendar the date a cd is due, and make sure you mail in that request.

F89MNQheaa	Its still worth it but be prepared that they may not take you if you are not employed. you will need sufficient character references and proof of where you have been living if with parents or similar. They will also ask for about 4 back dated bank statements including a current one to see if its feasable to let to you as youre unemployed and wont take you if they dont think you can keep up rent payments, also alot wont accept benefits if it takes time to find jobs with the current climate, check that before you sign anything or make any decisions. Most likely will wat a credit report aswell. Hope this helps :)  Quick note aswell, some may not let you rent a studio flat if there is two or more of you and if youre under 21 (sorry dont know your age) you will need a guarantuar( someone who will pay your rent if you cant pay) sorry if you knew that already :)|`|PZZkjST7aa	Yes, you can, but you would need a bank reference, and the character reference would have to come from people who know you professionally, like a doctor or a dentist, not just a friend.

Times are however changing rapidly on the economic front but I would suspect Agencies in the Capital can afford to be a little more choosy than one in the sticks.  You may be asked for a considerable deposit and perhaps the full amount of rent over the tenancy period.    Any personal references you could supply may come in handy - Previous employer etc . - friends/ relations may be willing to act as 'Guarantor' for you - an imposition I appreciate but it may swing the difference.

Ask them to mail you a check, or if you trust them, ask them to mail a check directly to your bank with the memo part stating your account number and the words for deposit.  Also ask them to make a receipt explaining that they are depositing money and again write the account number and your name.    I forgot about wire transfers.

For that to happen, I gave up my night life and weekend.  Remember, there will be many candidates who's willing to make this sacrifice, when you choose not to, the owners will notice.  Any advancements, bonuses and job opportunity for those who pays the price.  But some people are content to work as a drafter/job captain.  I've met many of them in my career.

And a debt-to-income ratio less than 36% even considering the mortgage payment.      good luck!    ps - I hope I was clear enough - you are not being realistic.

Even if you put 20% down, I doubt the bank would carry you for the rest of the loan.  Personally, I would be looking for something in the $150k -$200k price range.

A 1040X cannot be e-filed, therefore, you would need to complete a paper copy and mail it to the right address.    For future reference, tax information such as w-2s and 1099s are required to be mailed by the 31st, not received by the taxpayer.

Many require a certain amount of money to open an account.      T.D. Ameritrade's online trading commission is $9.99.    For comparison purposes:    Scottrade's online trading commission is $7.00 for stock over $1.00 a share.  Sharebuilder's real time online trading commission is $9.95.  Sharebuilder has a "Basic" automatic investment plan you can enroll in. The online trading commission is $4.00 but you can only buy/sell stock on Tuesday's.    Schwab's standard online trading commission is $12.95.  E-Trade's standard online trading commission is $12.99.    You really need to save more before you decide to open a brokerage account.

3mAgM405aa	Here's a short list of jobs which you can create to generate income:    1. Learn calligraphy so that you can provide handwritten invitations and thank you notes to prospective wedding parties, birthday celebrations, etc. Seek out clients through wedding planners at nearby churches and temples. A starter calligraphy kit usually runs around $20 and anyone can easily pick up this skill. The going rate is usually $1 per hand addressed item.    2. Seek from your neighbors a gardner position which involves planting, weed removal, plant/tree trimming, light brush clearance. You will be using the neighbor's equipment and tools. Again, do not represent yourself as a lawn mower since there are any number of safety issues involved. A door-to-door solicitation of surrounding neighbors is required and you can charge between $6 to $9 per hour.    3. Offer policing/removal or clearance of trash services to surrounding neighbors which involve trash pickup within nearby residential area. Limit the extent of pickup to small areas and be aware that there are no hazardous terrain or elements involved in this process. Again, a door-to-door solicitation of neighbors is in order. You can charge between $6.75 to $7.50 per hour.    4. Acquire a set of window cleaning tools [a bucket, liquid window cleaner, sponge, squeegee, handle with an extension and a small step ladder] and solicit local businesses for your window cleaning services. However, be careful to limit the height of the window cleaning to no higher than one story. Charge $1 per window panel.    5. Visit your nearest beauty salon and ask to be trained as a shampoo person who is also willing to sweep up fallen hair on the ground and do set ups [arranging dye kits, curler holders, etc.] for a set hourly fee.    6. Become a sign flipper by contacting your nearest realtor. A flipper is someone who stands at a major intersection and flips a "For Lease/Rental" sign in order to attract visitors to an open house or to a particular real estate listing. The hourly pay is at least the minimum wage.    7. Why not become a paid feeder servicing the disabled at nearby nursing, convalescent, assisted living/care centers and hospitals. It involves feeding food to patients who are unable to feed themselves. The starting rate is $8.00 per hour. The only downside is that one has to take precautions to wash one's hands after each feeding. A posting of your services [by a business card or flyer] on a reviewable bulletin board would be enough to generate customers. The paid feeder position is one of the fastest growing occupation at this time.

Dress Casual.|`|4qT0TfMZaa	Dress casual.|`|bab98853150b199df79ea228be16f757aa	Basically, you need to wear a suit ... jacket, nice shirt, pants or skirt, nice hose or socks, and good shoes.  You may remove your jacket before the session, but it's best if you don't.  These people are coming to you for 'advice' on how to improve their marriage, and you don't want to cause any offense, so you need to be sure that you have no 'cleavage' (above the waist) and not too much 'legs' or 'groin bag' below, that you appear 'conservative' but a bit 'hip' at the same time.  Earrings are fine if they're small (yes, even on men), but no 'large jewelry' or anything 'flashy.'  If you live in a city where life is more 'casual' then you still need a 'only the top button undone' business shirt or blouse, nice flat shoes (both men and women) in brown or black ... what you 'look like' can have a serious 'effect' on how your clients respond to your advice.

Some places of work have a dress code - agencies, for example. Others, like the 60% of MFTs who have their own businesses, don't have rules about proper dress.    If you're interviewing for a job, wear a suit. If you're interviewing for the program, wear a suit. If you don't have one available, then a shirt and tie with dress slacks or a skirt or dress slacks with a blouse.     If I were seeing an MFT, I wouldn't particularly care how he or she dressed as long as the therapy was good. If you're a client, then speak up and tell your therapist what you think about how he/she dresses.
1Q9ldcWSaa	Recall the formula to find the bond price on the date of a coupon payment:    P = F*r*[1 -(1+i)^-n]/i + C*(1+i)^-n, where    -------------------------------------  F = par value  C = maturity value  r = coupon rate per coupon payment period  i = effective interest rate per coupon payment period  n = number of coupon payments remaining  ----------------------    An easy way to derive this formula is to note that the bond price is the present value of all coupons (first term in formula) + the present value of the maturity value (second term in formula)    ------------------    In this problem F = 1000.  Since we are not given the maturity value, we can assume that it is the same as the par value.  So, C = 1000.    r = .08  i = .09  n = 12    Therefore, the bond price is 1000*.08 * (1 - 1.09^-12)/.09 + 1000*1.09^-12 = $928.39    Please give me best answer if I helped you.|`|k3crKzcUaa	$990

A credit card is you have for example a 3000 dollar credit limit. That money isn't really yours its really a loan to use based on your credit score.  Buying things with a credit card and not making payments will ruin your credit. But buying things with a debit card and returning them will just make it hard for you to figure out your balance in your account if you do it everyday. Certain places take a little longer to debit the money back to your card/account|`|OJBZJA2Yaa	I know that we're taught to always listen to our parents, but in this case she is just plain wrong.  Returning merchandise is not going to hurt your credit because it has absolutely no relationship to your credit.  Merchants do not and cannot report you to a credit bureau for returning an item to them.  Your credit file can only contain credit accounts, your history on those accounts, credit inquiry history, public records (i.e. bankruptcies, foreclosures, judgements, and the like), a list of your former names/addresses, your employer information, and a statement that you can provide.      I recommend that you read up on the following to understand how credit reporting works: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_Credit...    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_and_Ac...    Now a merchant may maintain what I would call a "blacklist" of people who abuse return policies and may refuse to allow you to return things in the future, but this has nothing to do with your credit and they cannot share this with current or future creditors.|`|AA10719605	Mom is incorrect.|`|FIG58FVpaa	No it won't ruin your credit.|`|BzGnuWs4aa	This time, momma was wrong.
