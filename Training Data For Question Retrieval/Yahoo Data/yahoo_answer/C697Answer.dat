PGanZdtmaa	no one deserves to be treated like that, i mean yeah it may happen once in a while but not a lot any ways. im sure he probably does like you one of his friends must have said something don't worry about it, he'll come around if he does then great but if not don't stress over it because there a lot of guys out there and they probably so pmsing like lol = )|`|Wu5q79tgaa	forget him ...if he was around his "boys" he was probably trying to act cool because his friends don't like you or something? anyone who wll act diffrent around somebody else is not worth it!!!!|`|4UhvP4H7aa	he likes you but hes immature so dont waste your time|`|P2r06qXQaa	I am a senior in high school, and a male, so I can help.<br>  He likes you. He's playing games. Guys do this kind of thing to find out exactly if the girl actually likes him. If she makes an effort to talk to him despite the fact that he ignored the girl, he knows. But be careful, some guys out there are just players. My advice is to talk to your best friend and ask her about the ups and downs of the relationship. Also look at other relationships he has been in. Just don't become to vulnerable. <br>  I hope I was able to help. God bless<br>  <br>  - Justin
LETd2hQwaa	Just because you're getting married, it doesn't mean you're gonna stop being human. You can't help what you dream about. That's normal. Don't let that worry you. I'm sure he dreams about other women too. As long as you don't act on those dreams, you'll be fine.

7e4jxj3Daa	A combination of the two.|`|BbT3DCHvaa	quiet and mysterious.|`|I5SypMlsaa	depends, same guy can like both kinds of girls, also depends for what purpose, to get laid party girl to be commited to the other one(but drop the mysterious thing you are just saying youare shy in other words)|`|f0YzgIoQaa	Depends on the guy...<br>  <br>  I prefer quieter mysterious, but also talkative and fun
7P6BNUsZaa	I know exactly how you feel. I was in the same situation a couple of months ago. <br>  <br>  If he is telling you he still loves you and misses you than you know that he wants to get back together. I would just give it time and see were it goes. Let him make the first move of getting back together. Even though you love him and miss him and want to be with him you don't want to push him away by not giving him space to think and being to emotional about your feelings.<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK!!
vYoyGziFaa	I grab his hand but I don't kiss him. Tilt your head and look expectant. he will get the idea.

Zp22sUhAaa	no, he still likes you, just shy.
T3IpfcY9aa	My only advice--after having been in your situation before is not to be shy at all.  These people have never met you before and you don't want them to think that you have the personality of a wet dish towel.  If food is involved ask to help in the kitchen--it will keep you occupied and make you seem useful.  Introduce yourself to people and ask questions about your boyfriend to the family in an amusing way--like he's the one 'on the spot' instead of you.  But if you do nothing else just relax and be friendly.  Don't hide in a corner and try to get to know some of the people who are important to your boyfriend--if nothing else you will score points with him.<br>  <br>  These things are always so darn awkward, but just don't worry about what they'll think of you.  Go there with the intention to have a good time.  Laugh at jokes and smile a lot.  And don't dress revealing at all, but I'm sure you already guessed that one.|`|J1kJb98Maa	first dont say "gunna" will make you look like well what you said you dont want to be|`|781d71752d258090b69b654451d07ecfaa	CANCEL!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|G4wINvnHaa	pretend like everyone is there to meet someone else. be yourself and remember to try to act comfortable and happy to be there|`|I5SypMlsaa	spoke a joint before you go<br>  no seriously though just relax he wont let them bug you too much, just be yourself, breathe so you odnt faint ;)|`|4DDSD9Syaa	Just be yourself everything will be fine. If you try too hard that is when you mess up and look fake.|`|uzZuwtgXaa	Good luck just be yourself.|`|91a18e53fb4559a96509649df9cfa51aaa	Just be polite, smile, say hi, shake hands, laugh at their jokes, and answer their questions. Maybe even ask some questions if you are interested. Don't show that you are nervous. If they share stories or topics, share something in your life that is similar. Comment on things like "ooh I heard that 'fill in the blank' ".  Good luck!!!|`|AA11146198	Be polite, cool and just be yourself. No lying or exaggerations about stuff because ppl will call you out on it. Just be really chill and a sweet girl and you should win them over.|`|5KCfpwgjaa	just have a glass of wine before you go that will calm you down but only one don't want to be sloppy drunk when you meet them lol|`|yyMRQkEmaa	i know being yourself is hard at times....but you just got to be yourself. They will like you for being you. Just act YOURSELF.|`|g8pRhElsaa	think about how you'd like him to be around your family....relaxed and easy going. just take a deep breath, put your chin up, and smile a lot!|`|0d1bSfV3aa	What you should do is dress really slutty, wear a short skirt and no panties.|`|yc35IXIOaa	Good Luck :)<br>  Just try to be yourself, theres no point in being someone your not ... Good luck|`|qiZvFOZNaa	be yourself, but dont be afraid to talk.  You might look more dumb if you dont say anything, than saying something dumb or w/e.  but dont worry about that.  Have fun, be generally interested in them, show off yourself, show how much you care about ur bf, just be charmful.. and honestly.. have a good time.  They are gonna love you!!
Wy0lUjP9aa	Yeah, that could be a sign when he starts staring at you. It shows that you giving him the cupcake had made him interested in you because of your kind gesture. He may talk to you tomorrow or when ever the next time you have school. Make sure you talk to him more so he doesn't lose interest. <br>  <br>  BTW, Happy Birthday!<br>  H is for Happy<br>  A is for anything<br>  P is for personal<br>  P is for pie<br>  Y is for Yo-Yo<br>  <br>  B is for Birthday<br>  I is for invincible<br>  R is for Reading<br>  Uh..

pIqDeiUqaa	awww no. its not fair. its not fair that he makes you feel sad. he shouldnt be doing that. maybe hes going through really big troubles, because ya know, you never know what things are going on in peoples lives. so just give it sometime and relax and go with the flow and everything will perfectly fall into place. time heals everythinggg!<br>  hope i helped :]|`|zUdxoRbyaa	no, its not fair. you should have hung up on the creep as soon as he started cursing.

BopBYwSdaa	I dated Latino before (El Salvadorian), I dated asian men before (thai, malay, korean-american, HK), I dated european and american too... <br>  <br>  Size has nothing to do with race but personal preferences... These 2 asian women attracted to tall men ... I also fond of tall men over short men because I'm alread short and petite myself, lol<br>  <br>  If these 2 asian women said ...they "don't date asian men"...then it's a different story.<br>  <br>  Latino women is hot! (take it from a women, lol)|`|W41F7EFfaa	hm.... i don't know, i've never dated an asian guy, but all of my cousins ONLY date asian guys except for one who is dating a white guy right now. i guess it's only true in your gfs' former lovers' case and not true to my cousins asian lovers. my brother in law is asian and he's really caring for my sister and their children. so there you have it. <br>  <br>  as for the asian anatomy, if you really want to know the truth then maybe you can find that out first hand yourself.|`|tRNiXtplaa	that is their opinions of what they think.
JNcB7Ffbaa	i get really shy and smile, a lot. I always try to talk to him too. Hope I helped.
Rb087BsAaa	Wait...you won't be happy rushing things.  And then you'll be starting over again except with more baggage than before.
zUdxoRbyaa	keep the conversation on her. ask what she likes. too many guys are hung up on themselves. pay her attention and, most importantly, look her directly in the eyes when you talk to her. it appears more sincere that way.
Cb0l4QvKaa	nope, it just improves her house cleaning skills for the future|`|N3qaHrmCaa	you sound really messed up, wtf is wrong with you? uh YEA she'll get mad at you and if she has half a brain in her she'll dump you.|`|7z9eKO2maa	what kind of jacka*s are you? honestly.. if you can't respect women then you should STAY THE HELL AWAY FROM THEM... lunatics these days..|`|h0qCMhfYaa	Ya probably i would. If the weight of the sack doesnt knock her out then she'll proally dump you. You sound like a jerk...|`|ZG6tDWOPaa	duhh she would get madd i cant believe u even asked that <br>  retard|`|nSXlffmpaa	Yeah she'd be pretty pissed at you man. Do not let women do more house work. Appreciate them.|`|o1rzGR8kaa	A 5lb bag could break her neck dumas

Guys love food and girls. So having you and dinner makes the best combo ^_^
1zmmlzjkaa	Take the chance. You like her a lot, she likes you. Its worth it. If it ends badly, so be it. And you two are best friends now, so you'll probably end up together or best friends again if you guys split. Give it a shot.|`|nNYBhelGaa	talk to her before hand<br>  say i really want to go out with you, but if it ends badly i dont want to lose our friendship<br>  <br>  if you have sierous doubts that it wont work than dont take the chance untill you are sure she is perfect for you to go out with<br>  <br>  ask how she feels|`|Nd6uItCDaa	my sister is still good friends with all of her ex's....<br>  so why couldn't you if it did end badly?|`|D4o3hmMLaa	Here is the risk you are facing that i see;<br>  1) She could reject you but if she has a good personality then she will still accept your friendship<br>  <br>  2) She will get very discomfort because she doesn't want to take this relationship to the next level. If this happen, then just talk her out of it saying that its okay to be friend still.<br>  <br>  3) She is already in some relationship with another guy that you didn't know.. If this is the case then just smile and say "I'm sorry i didn't know, i hope he will take care of you"... this will give you a chance of being closer to her if her boyfriend broke up with her.<br>  <br>  Is it worth the risk to go and ask her out? You decide... but in my advice; just do it and see the result... if its good then congrats... if its bad then move on and find a different girl. Don't waste time on loving someone you don't know if they love you back or not!|`|AA11612196	from past experiences i wouldnt but its completely up to you!<br>  sometimes you have to just give things a try or start out really slow. dont jump into anything to fast<br>  answer mine plz<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AjNiG5ttPo9LcvPqpUx4sYnsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090226135539AAPUFiW">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>

17aab5400531185eeea85ec13e69a65eaa	It sounds like he just doesn't like showing his emotions or getting soppy about it. He sounds like a proud lad who feels weakened if he tells her he misses her etc. It's an ego thing. He feels less macho. <br>  <br>  It seems like he does like her, because as he said, he wouldn't be with her otherwise. But he's just one of those guys who will not show emotions or affection. It must be hard for your friend as she wants to be cuddled and told she is beautiful etc. He's probably head over heels for her but hasn't got the guts to actually tell her. <br>  <br>  Tell her to try not to worry, as he's using non verbal signs of affection instead. Not all guys are sensitive as others. They will be ok I think.|`|oBe7igsaaa	You have to understand that we guys don't think the way you girls do.  We have girl friends for sex, love and sex is not the same thing.  we are most of the time horny and want sex.<br>    Also we don't like talking about our feelings . why is it you girls are always want to know this or that , why not just enjoy what you got.  If he don't ask you to marry him , you are just someone to have sex with. <br>    If you don't like that find someone else. Maybe she's a good lay and that's all he want.|`|hjS7HA7daa	She should talk to him, he may be undre stress. Just give him time.

(i'm 15 too btw) it seems like that for me with each one. but each time i swear to myself that it's different. same with this time. <br>  <br>  it could just be that we like that person so much (and they occupy our minds so much) that we dont really realize whether we are ACTUALLY in love or not.

So like I said the day of prom make a huge performance and for the end flide across the floor and give her a rose saying you love her.|`|7d0cee6031016b30adec5c099b087410aa	Guys don't really need to know how to dance. What they really need to know is how to show off their girl :)<br>  <br>  So, all you need is your little box in which you kinda move side to side keeping rhythm with the music and making sure you and your girl are just having a good time. If she's really into the whole dancing thing she'll probably be all over you or something, so just keep up! haha. Just have fun ok and don't worry! Being self-conscious about dancing makes people look stiff like robots! Trust me, feel the beat and get it on. It's a club so it will be crowded and everyone is going to be wondering exactly what you are wondering, they could care less about how others are acting. Just have fun! Hope I helped :) :)|`|7ko9czaaaa	smile and be yourself it will come to you,|`|plFyCtm3aa	Depends on the kind of club you go to. Depends on your girlfriend too. Usually people go in a group of like best friends. Going with just your girlfriend can get a little weird, especially at a club. No one really knows how to dance. They just do their thing. Don't embarrass yourself though by doing like the robot or some other dance like that. Unless you are good at it. Lol...|`|ZvfItEsVaa	I'm sure if you looked up club dancing or something on youtube, you'd find it.<br>  <br>  Anywayz, clubs are just massive parties basically, and all you have to know is to lip-read (as the music is usually really really loud). Other than that, just have fun :D|`|ubbKS6BBaa	Just go and talk to friends. There's no way to act. If people are dancing, dance. If you don't like to dance, stand around. lol. Not much to do there besides mingle and dance.|`|ar7ynJB8aa	When dancing just follow her lead put your hand on her hip and just enjoy the music and being that close to her. Don't worry about being embarrassed whatever happens, happens. <br>  <br>  It's a club: meaning one-- it's dark two-- it's crowded and three-- there's going to be drunk people there. <br>  <br>  With all of that going on no one is going to notice every single detail that you're doing. <br>  <br>  Just have fun and don't worry.
620435831a260a57d4798da422b767c7aa	Just sounds like your relationship is casual. I mean, its not like you HATE fooling around in the room. So, I doubt he is using you.|`|trpvcTBiaa	I think super casual and he doesn't have a lot of money.|`|TmjFDpNZaa	it doesnt sound like hes using u, i think its just because your relationship is kinda casual and he probably doesnt have any money right now.
FZKFLTyLaa	Question<br>  i like a girl. why do i feel guilty?<br>  Because you're basically engaging in prostitution.<br>  Until you are ready to have a committed relationship play it slow.
Tf19RETiaa	sure, why not? if its an STD then no
58d6b4483a329162e1f9eeafcf972793aa	Of course I would, and have. People are people all over, an incurable disease doesn't dictate who they are on the inside and whether they have a good heart and intention or not. <br>  <br>  We all have flaws, or as I call them "uniqueness"|`|3JlETLazaa	My gf has asthma so yeah i would<br>  however it doesn't really effect us as there is no problem<br>  Look past the person and see there personality
lNlL0Ag2aa	And I knew who did that? I would definitely laugh out loud (I'm actually laughing from imagining it). That is really funny, and I would definitely feel flattered that a girl has that good of a sense of humor.<br>  <br>   I'd probably think that she's into me which is exciting considering that I always like to know what girls are hiding in their minds from the public, especially when I'm interested in them.|`|Nuu5zUWuaa	probably use it as toilet paper and stick it bakc in your locker|`|qy07K2k5aa	I would be surprised and wonder who put it there. If I know who, then I would wonder what her intentions are.|`|NkYWScEdaa	I would laugh and take it as a joke.|`|ryh5AslRaa	problly think ****|`|ewOD5x0taa	I wouldn't care about it. I'd just throw it away and forget about it.|`|Nj0SuF09aa	its inmature.. but funny(:<br>  DO ITT..<br>  later onn tell him you were messing with him.|`|wdDYM7TJaa	Break up with that girl. It means she is cheating.|`|rNmekxLcaa	Tell the hall monitor.|`|wEZ7mNICaa	I would laugh|`|Cb0l4QvKaa	haha its a good prank, he'll be mad turned on|`|yXvAc6cUaa	i would think...............ook|`|DGR7FNOXaa	find out who it is and try to get her number...|`|oTtZekp3aa	I would think it would be some form of flirtation attempt from an unknown person. If thats the goal, go ahead. Drive him mad.|`|U2N5kQmlaa	no way that would be weird and all hes friend will make fun of him forever nicknamed as the ' I've been naughty "guy <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  DON"T DO IT|`|8exAmm9maa	I'd think who the f*ck put that there and throw it in the garbage.|`|nzPGYy8kaa	He'd either freak out or be like "Can I get in on that?". Just make sure to tell him it's a joke later on.|`|7LDeOmvmaa	i would probably be 1. really ticked off or 2. laugh my butt off|`|iYyzY9sUaa	it would be surprising and i would want to know who turned me on|`|f1Unp3fBaa	I agree with Lluvy or whoever that guy is. If you're not going to leave your name, forget about it.
iYyzY9sUaa	ask her on a friend date and see how she acts|`|xHqqZEXNaa	I dont know, hate to burst your bubble, i really do, but that's kind of just a valentines day kinda thing, you know that lovey dovery sh*t. <br>  <br>  But i mean, you never know. Who knows what women think, i dont. If you like her, pursue her, make it known to her that you are really interested in her. Chivalry aint dead, us guys still gatta pull our weight, and if you dont have interest in her, well then f*ck her
iYyzY9sUaa	sure look at Hue Hefner
lSq1LJUtaa	I would recommend on the first day wearing something that covers up the tattoos.  Once they get to know your lovely personality, hopefully it won't matter too much to them.|`|6fa2568b75c06da2670c61858c9441ceaa	Tattoos are a complete turn off, especially to parents. Cover them up until they know you better.
x4HwY3Nwaa	Yes, its normal to have feelings for an ex. You were in a relationship with them and probably spent a lot of time with them, so it would be extremely easy to start liking them again.<br>  <br>  To stay focused on your current boyfriend, just remember that your ex is an ex for a reason. Something obviously didn't work out, and now you're in the perfect relationship. You wouldn't want to give that up for something that probably won't work out.|`|NB2AQwv9aa	well what ever attracted you to this guy in the first place will always be there so yeh its normal but if your gettin real strong feelings for him you need to sort it out before somebody gets hurt make a decision who you want and see it through i would say avoid the guy but if the feelings are already there its too late|`|XL5sB7PKaa	congrats on your bf, but the feelings that you have for your ex are just there from when you were with him, there not real, i call them false feelings(f.f.). so just focus on your bf, and just be friends with your ex, or if its too much, just stop talking to him|`|0JHszg4zaa	Stay distanced from your ex. Most crushes never fade. Unless you really see your self with your ex, try and distance yourself or the fire might re ignite.|`|jLmtqrMmaa	Normal.  It's because chemistry is a chemical, physical thing.  Remind yourself that its like a drug ... the high you feel isn't real. Remind yourself of all the things he did to make you not like him.
XH2o1MM6aa	.If it's for his eyes only.Then that's a great idea.However if all and sundry can read this.Not so good.As you'll make him and yu the subject of ridicule.|`|GCtH2eBUaa	i think it's adorable :)
VdjvJ2bvaa	I have a few times. When I thought the time and setting was perfect, and the stars seemed to be in perfect alignment. Then, I realize the girl was not interested at all, she was either just trying to be nice or been dared to flirt/dance with me.|`|qy07K2k5aa	Yes, I have experienced such before, but it didn't affect me as much.|`|hwKFm7H8aa	since he wasnt you bf...nah why should u cry?
Nuu5zUWuaa	most white girls find indian guys quite grotesque in looks, custom and behavior|`|WSziasfMaa	I generally only date guys who have non-white ethnic backgrounds.  They're hotter than white guys, and they generally have a bit more sensitivity to women because they have experience with being outcast as minorities.  In other words, they know what its like not to be a white male protestant, which is very attractive!|`|MmtSX4saaa	not me|`|zeZtFbGjaa	I wouldnt personally, maybe becuz Im only ever attracted to black guys, but there are thousands of girls who love asians<br>  <br>  Gud luck x|`|CCLLnSrGaa	it wouldnt bother me.been out with different culture bloke|`|Mp2r9Ul5aa	hey im a hot brown girl.<br>  thanks.|`|5YAe0Vffaa	Yeah, as long as they're attractive.  I know some pretty cute Indian guys and my family, friends and community would be totally fine with that.  I'm not sure about their families, but where I'm from, interracial relationships are quite common and accepted.  Oh yeah, and having a british accent would help a lot here in America I think. =)|`|06de8f8bd2139814a2ba53ab67d9d65daa	only SOME. really hate to say this but i thikn about 98% of indian guys are really un attractive.<br>  but im white and live in a completley different culture to indian boys. indian women are beautiful though :D , and they find indian men attractive.<br>  <br>  ooo i can currently think of a few indian guys who are quitehot tbf :D<br>  and i totally "would"<br>  (;<br>  so it depends.<br>  haha (:<br>  hope i helped in some sort of way.<br>  x|`|YYkZWJJ7aa	i think that very much depends on the individual . it is impossible to generalise who fancies who when it is human nature to differ.<br>  <br>  it is all down to personal taste, for example; i have never really dated anyone but white men, my twin sister is engaged to a brit of indian ethnicity and he is a welcome member of our close family circle.<br>  <br>  you fancy, whoever you fancy im afraid|`|pgseuoE7aa	i have to say i myself have never seen a indian dude with a white girl in my life.  i seen asian guys with white girls but thats pretty rare already, but i live in canada so i dont know much about other countries.|`|FOIPNMvjaa	It shouldn't matter whether what ethnicity they are, as long as you like who they are; their personality is what counts. So, no, different cultures don't bother me.|`|HIav9sVuaa	nope wouldnt bother me at all my family wouldnt care either as long as there nice it dnt matter about the skin colour where ur from religion culture. :D|`|c3f286ce744b403a29e15eec27c8138faa	No it wouldn't bother me.|`|CJj5g3DMaa	no
AA11795191	We dated for about two weeks, and we saw each other almost every other day. I stayed over at his place, and when we woke up in the morning (we are adults, both in our late 20s), he asked if this meant we were bf/gf, and I said yes. :-) Id say if you get a second date, then things are looking good. :-)
mCoipTkbaa	Your right!!:)|`|SLIIyjyRaa	Where is the question in this? Go write it in your journal.<br>  <br>  People can ask whatever they want, if you do not like, then ignore it.<br>  <br>  Why do type every letter with a capital letter, it does not need to be capitalized.|`|41fe712a36ecf2746af8f97a562a2794aa	Also, if you weigh around 20 stone the answer is likely to be no.|`|Iod5edCSaa	and your question is?|`|AA11795191	I Capatilize Every Word That I Write To Make It Look Like I Have Something Important To Say.<br>  <br>  Is this a question? Nope. Buh-leted.<br>  <br>  Edit: Yes, Im very jealous that you came up with some completely unnecessary rant before I did. Oh wait, I dont do that. Especially not on Y!A.
pgJ9lvyMaa	Tell your mom!  A nine year old shouldn't be dating anyone.  <br>  <br>  And that boyfriend or exboyfriend, is sick and perverted for trying to date a 9 year old.

Don't date the guy who can't handle it.|`|WxV9P9NQaa	well if shes hot maybe but the fact that she poses for playboy could be hot but kinda sluttish and showing themselves to other guys which i dont think i want a girl to be like that|`|AA10243185	yes i would, if the woman is doing that stuff is looking for a real relationship. Everyone has needs regardless of what there job may be|`|nFVXKPfiaa	Haha, of course... but make sure people aren't just going to date you just because of the claim "im going out with a play boy model". <br>  <br>  unless thats what you want...|`|iZYw500Vaa	Lol i would!! as long as your not a slut ts ok
VlxjNzgtaa	I think guys need to see that you are down to earth enough for them to ask you out. I heard that if you are very good looking and act like you know you are, guys think you might be playing around with them and with several others at the same time. They also are afraid that you will think you are too good for them. That's what I heard anyway. Just try to be friendly with them and be yourself. Never act like someone you're not just to get a date, they'll sense it. Try to act natural, but don't over-do it to where you lose your manners and all hehe...<br>  I'm sure you know what I mean. <br>  well good luck ;)|`|hF6uZqWRaa	just because your hot it doesn't mean they see you in a relationship. Maybe they see you as a sluty girl or maybe your just too hot that they feel intimidated like you said...you will never know until you actually talk to one of the guys.<br>  <br>  * also when i junior high guys use to tell me i was hot but that they wanted to date other girls since they were easy. at that age they were just intrested in sleeping around and didnt want something serious...i can be so many things. like i said...ask.|`|Cb0l4QvKaa	got a picture?
IP4Bgxd5aa	as a female, and ahas had this happen to me before i think im my opinion that you should maybe try to ask her out, you have talked so thats a good step. get a group of people to go out to dinner or a movie and invite her, and if she says no, she may not like you or just to scared to say yes, so think of something else to talk about, like homework make her laugh that always helps, talk about whatever comes to mind, just not anything stupis haha.<br>  good luck|`|r3xuKqakaa	say what comes to your mind . <br>  random things can lead to interresting coversations , you never know unless you try (:|`|OHcUkfNDaa	just start by asking what she likes to do then suggest yall see a movie together. or suggest yall do what she likes to do.(i.d. rock climbing go rock climbing)|`|E23s2wSNaa	when it stops, just say anything, like ur shirt is nice, or something funny like my pants are annoying, i cant be comfortable in these and idk, it comes natural for me.<br>  <br>  keep in mind there are no rules when conversating, of course no rudeness or anything, but i hope u know what i mean ;)|`|lIx6kngbaa	be confident in yourself|`|Wqo62Pjsaa	Be confident<br>  be yourself<br>  compliment her <br>  and then after a few days or weeks ask her out|`|SZnAyk55aa	Well the reason it stops is because she thinks you need to know more about her and to ask the next question. When you have small talk you should ask the first question   then she answers well if you start and she comes back at you who's turn is it....yours....so if you talk back more she will be more interested...you should ask her to dinner and then you will have plenty of time for talking plus girls LOVE when guys take them to dinner. I hope it helps.|`|726c39d028b26cddd2db5c6325f9c0e4aa	Ask about a thing in the class you "have trouble on", then lead that into something.  It will come naturally.  Maybe something slightly personal so you can discuss it and keep a conversation going.  Anything that keeps a discussion is a good idea.|`|57Wnlfv7aa	start the conversation by asking about skool , classes , lessons and subjects u are learning then start to talk about hangings out and then u'l find the conversation flowing , and when u see that u know each other and that she seems to be interested in u ask her out :))|`|Vqgku2sNaa	To tell you the truth, I really don't think she'll care what you say.  :] Just talk about the common intrests you share. Ask her a question. If she likes you, she'll probably smile and respond, trust me. Just be yourself!
XH2o1MM6aa	.She wants you to ask her out on a date.If she enquired about your activities on Valentines Day.That was because she had none.So contact her and invite her out.On a date.
0JHszg4zaa	what? that made no sense. and if you really were emo you wouldn't point it out.<br>  <br>  And I've been there, I'm there. If you really are what you want to call "Emo" talk to someone, don't post it on the internet. Get some help. It could save your life.|`|O22JiTsEaa	pfft kids these days dont know what love is... <br>  <br>  i bet no one knows what emo means anymore <br>  <br>  1 how old are you btw<br>  <br>  2 your a idiot|`|R4eg5x7Jaa	ok... what is your point?|`|vtafeEIJaa	like to know you better|`|kkM8vFfKaa	Whaaat?|`|S4IvjacEaa	If you were MATURE AT ALL you wouldn't think that using "ur", "2", and a lot of punctuation is cool.<br>  You'd also be able to figure out that the chances anyone who answered your "Broken Heart Question" will stumble on this is very slim.<br>  And you wouldn't stereotype YOURSELF. Being sad for two days because your 10 year old boyfriend broke up with you and wearing black does not make you an emo.|`|47iY7d5Laa	Uhh, I don't know what it is you are asking.. But You are obviously a poser.<br>  <br>  Real Emo's don't call themselves emo. They try to hide their sadness from everyone.|`|JDQ3dJPkaa	so, how old are you anyway? i'm not sure if i see the question...|`|syzUenkXaa	Dint quite get the question .

tUaJPEtlaa	okay first of all a girl hates it when you talk to them on aim or text and you dont talk to them at school make sur to make conversation and look in her eyes when she is talking do not look up or down keep her looking at you. If you find her staring at you smile at her in a way that makes her thhink you like her. Also MAKE SURE you give her nice comments like your eyes are beautiful you look pretty today stuff like that!!!!<br>  oh and good luck|`|ZQZf1iINaa	STOP ASKING THIS QUESTION AND TELL HER HOW YOU FEEL!
sHuC3r8Zaa	that means he thinks of you as a really good friend. <br>  <br>  just as he would call another male friend of his a brother, he calls you a sister.<br>  <br>  its a good thing, he likes you a lot, in a friendly way.|`|KHC2oE8iaa	RUN. lol. listen i don't know who's saying what about who and where its happening. all i know is to many messed up situations is a sign of a bad thing. his friends tell you this, he tells you that. this is real stupid to be honest with you. if a chick saw me as she sees her brother then i'd say that the love affair is O-V-E-R.|`|hF6uZqWRaa	if he says you remind him of his sister it can be a bad thing. he sees you as someone he can talk to and be friends with... i wouldn't want to date someone that remind me of my brother physically or even acts like him...i would feel like im making out with my brother LOL.|`|SPh4ctPCaa	It means that he's close to you but doesn't really want to be your boyfriend.|`|lUty60Pxaa	i'd say game over|`|POHWTDPRaa	It means exactly what he said. He feels like you two are as close as a brother and sister.|`|vtW3qPZmaa	It's a nice way of him saying he wants to be your friend but he's not attracted to you.
POHWTDPRaa	It sounds like he either is cheating or is very close to it. But is also could be something totally innocent. Keep your mouth shut until you have something a little more solid to go on.|`|620435831a260a57d4798da422b767c7aa	I think, you should bring it to his attention. What's the point of a relationship if you can't be open with each other? I think you better let him know how you feel about the texting.|`|ea073069c581a3e342f2f7ec101708f1aa	Every person has the right to know if their lover has an affair, you should have a talk with him about it.  But then again, she could be a friend of his that you don't know about.|`|41fe712a36ecf2746af8f97a562a2794aa	It's not looking good, however work people do flirt and joke around so don't go overboard yet.<br>  <br>  At least you know what to look out for, but if you don't trust him now, some would say what's the point?|`|pgJ9lvyMaa	I'm a girl, but I'm going to answer any way. <br>  <br>  Snooping is not a good thing.  You learn things that you shouldn't necessarily learn, and once you learn them, you feel compelled to snoop more. <br>  <br>  He may not be cheating yet, but it seems that there is an attraction and that it may happen.  Since admitting to the snooping will probably cause more problems than you want, I would wait and see if this progresses.
Cb0l4QvKaa	nah good luck|`|xHqqZEXNaa	Ok first of all, ditch the "little" part before the word "intoxicated", i'm not trying to be a dick, but once you get her drunk you take her as far as she wants, i recommend a kiss, so you dont seem like a scumbag, but then again, she wont remember it anyway.|`|Or6RoRWDaa	Yes, where protection.|`|0PKoq9fdaa	Just go for it..
U7UXGZGNaa	Well you don't want to end up with someone you don't like...tell the other one you like her too?|`|IJ4iv4Wsaa	Tell the girl you like that you do.<br>  and tell the other one you don't generally have "those" kinds of feelings for her.
yt2zVOZfaa	Comedies, horrors, or romances.<br>  <br>  I'd go with Step Brothers for comedy, the funniest film EVER (In my opinion)
SLIIyjyRaa	Well, she does not like you. There is nothing you really can do. Find someone else.|`|XcxL6ZMqaa	well, im sorry dude. but, if a girl doesnt like you then why go out w/ her? you prolly deserve more anyway! why would you wanna go out w/ someone that doesnt give their whole heart into the relationship... u no? i wouldnt! i would want someone that likes me for me and likes me as much as i like her (him for me! lol.) i hope i helped. just think... would you rather go out w/ her and then when you get into the relationship she breaks up w/ you or would you just want it to be left here at this point. but dude, I GET HOW YOU FEEL! it stinks to be rejected.... i know. but, sometimes ppl like us gotta just move on to better ppl. and trust me, there are ppl much better than girls like that!!! hope i helped. bye :) email me if you think you want more answers from me for other questions! also... im adding you to my contacts also! bye|`|iYyzY9sUaa	i have the same problem and she has a boyfriend but im trying to move on im writing a journal about how i feel just to always remind her it has a years worth of writings in it. im gonna give it to her so she at least knows i haven't told her yet though... sigh
xrULvzbOaa	umm... haha what?|`|JUXpVYC4aa	?????????????????|`|UQNj7GOCaa	i dnt get it..
hLBEXVyXaa	go for it. what do you have to lose? and if you were in love with her before, then who says you cant be again? its a shot worth taking. and if you were to say no, you'd regret it later in life. its better knowing what it was like than wondering what could've been [:|`|XtmPYHyJaa	matters if i'm dating someone - no<br>  otherwise yes|`|xG2bbN0haa	Go for it. You will wonder later, if you don't.
IqEUjPMqaa	he's kinda cute, a 7|`|ATGXKT08aa	4|`|DKNvQ1ftaa	not the best pic of him. he is cute....i'd give him a 7|`|CBa9G4j4aa	He's like a 6|`|k07IyDvwaa	he is kind of cute, his teeth look wierd though, i would give him an 8
XOoxPm0gaa	Be confident about it! Girls like it when a guy is open and honest about how they feel towards them. Try to find her alone and get the conversation going for a while, then ask her out from there. You can also try and talk to her friend and ask her to give you guys some space before hand. If she truly is good friends with this girl, then she will respect that and give her space.|`|OlTuytNVaa	You need to speak up quick, or she'll think its just a hit and run. Ask her how her day is going and about school. Then ask her out. Talk to her when you have the time. Not in between classes when you are rushing, but lunch, after school, etc. <br>  (if you aren't in school, ask about her day) then go from there|`|ASSF5rO9aa	just tell her you got nervous at the time and that you were scared
Cb0l4QvKaa	use periods i can't understand wut ur saying.|`|oCxBeEI6aa	*yawn*<br>  So, uh...what were you saying? I fell asleep in the beginning of the first sentence. That's because the whole paragraph is a sentence! I can't understand that if you're using a whole sentence for a paragraph. Use periods. They look like this: . <br>  Anyways, since I'm too lazy to read the paragraph, let me give you some advice. Even though I didn't read it, this advice is always helpful and will keep you out of trouble, just in case you are in trouble. <br>  DON'T DO THE CRIME IF YOU CAN'T DO THE TIME.<br>  Have a nice day. :)

Give small hints to her that you like her (compliment that you like her shirt even if you don't like it<br>  4. Don't over do anything!!!<br>  5. Take a deep breath. In and out.<br>  6. Just do it...  Ask her out one day that she seems like she's in a good mood.<br>  7. If she says no.  And you still like her don't give up.  Ask if you guys could be friends<br>  8. Maybe when you get to high school you can ask her again.  Girls change (like magic) when they get to highs school.  <br>  9. See what clubs she is going to be doing in hs.  U said she was in the band and so maybe she would be doing marching band.  <br>  10. Learn to play an instrument over the summer. She will notise you because you weren't in the band in middle school and wonder y.<br>  11. If she asks why tell her because you wanted to hang out with her more.  <br>  12. Ask her out again.|`|cj2wPxiCaa	research
A8kFnvw1aa	He definitely likes you a lot. If he keeps stealing your pencil and pushing you, then he's obviously flirting. Also, if your friends keep telling you that he likes you, he probably does.<br>  <br>  He flirts with you a lot. You should "accidentally" let him hear you telling your friend you like him. :)|`|thmlwAZDaa	he does like you. He acts like that because boys at that age arent really mature and are insecure. dont sweat it :]
hF6uZqWRaa	i know how you feel. i dated a guy for 2 years. i knew him well. the way he acted, what he liked, the way he was in bed...i ended up with a new bf and i would want to do it with the lights off i was so shy around him...but 3 years later i love him to death and feel so good around him... once you get to know your new guy a little more you will feel better around him and not feel sick when you think of getting intimate with him. good luck.|`|ldwaVRy4aa	your nervous because you like, you are getting older so don't worry bout being intimate.  don't worry about how pure you have been, if you want him, take him.  it'll make you feel better around him since you guys seem to like each other|`|kvCdRzzBaa	yea if you really like him it will be like that at first! i love that feeling tho! i think its one of the best parts of a realationships. dont worry it will work out! and have fun

He needed to grow up big time.<br>  <br>  In college guys will be all over you!<br>  I bet a lot of guys think they are out of your league as well.<br>  Don't fret about it.<br>  <br>  Just wait for the right guy.<br>  and if you like this guys enough.... talk to him more, pull out some charm and flirting.<br>  He may fall in love :)<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|yfPu5pcZaa	Yeah I liked a lot of guys in high school that I thought I'd never have a chance with. When high school was over they all told me they had the biggest crush on me. It was too late by then, I had already been with my current boyfriend. <br>  <br>  Sometimes you have to take a chance. At least let flirt and let them know you like them.|`|wfp6xn5aaa	I like a girl whom I know I do not have a chance with.  It is terrible, and I have such low self-esteem...<br>  <br>  It is very depressing.|`|hF6uZqWRaa	yes and i actually got him. I was uuumm i think 17 at the time and he was 24. I really like him (he was my sisters friend) i had a crush on him since i was like 15. Someone how we started texting and talking on the phone and i guess he got interested. but he had a fiance. he would always ask me if he left his fiance would i date him...i was with someone at the time so i didn't know what to say. but he keep using the excuse i was too young. 1 year later he ended up with a girl who is only 1 year older than me and they have a kid. At least i got to kiss him (make out) and have my time... so dont say you dont have a change...you maybe do as long as you try you will get that person.|`|SimAO1IUaa	i dont know either of you but im sure hes not out of your league! you should chat it up with him and see where that takes you. i have never liked a guy that i had no chance with,  i think theres a chance for everyone! <br>  <br>  answer mine plz? <br>  <a href="http://au.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090226143429AANe83j">http://au.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>|`|ze4Gt1araa	Yes this is so happening to me right I'm falling in love with my personal trainer and I know that I won't have a chance with him despite the times he flirts with me but still there's no way. And yeah it does suck balls big ones :(|`|pZHq44oKaa	I feel like this is a confidence issue. There's been a couple of times where I totally thought the guy was out of my league but if you are yourself and you two just click...it will happen! It's like you're giving up before you even try. Just go in with the mentality that if it happens, awesome, if not, its not the end of the world.|`|3KAiV9zTaa	yeah i liked two guys who i knew was out of my league. one was a preppy i thought was so cute. the second guy, i knew, and me and him did like each other,but it never worked out. but yeah...life moves on.

uBssj3Znaa	he just isn't that into you|`|ze4Gt1araa	You got blown off because guys are like that their all meanies and maybe cuz he was broke and couldn't take you out so he decided to ignore your call. Hun, move on and find someone better because you deserve way better than this. This guy isn't treating you nor appreciating you the way he supposed to.<br>  <br>  Good luck! :)
vrFBkvKeaa	She was probably trying to help, but I can see how you would be offended.  Women your size get pregnant all the time.  Just brush her silly comment off.  And good luck!|`|dlGZebDmaa	You are being sensitive...<br>  I'd appreciate ANY type of information...<br>  This is just a technical element<br>  You wouldn't feel hurt if the doctor tells you the same thing|`|xNvbtRJBaa	sorry to say but your bff is wrong!! my dads friend when she was 9 she got pregnat! so get pregnant when ever you want!|`|1oDmo13vaa	she was just trying to inform you, you shouldn't get insulted in any way or form|`|yyMRQkEmaa	your friend is lying... you weight and height are fine to have a baby...|`|uBssj3Znaa	she was probably just trying to help ... I wouldn't take too much offense to it, but you should ask her why she said that if it is really bothering you, especially if you are BFF|`|oKY0s2THaa	She was probably trying to help.<br>  <br>  Usually for skinnier women it hurts a lot more in birth. But look on the bright side... at least your not being called a fat cow. :D|`|ze4Gt1araa	I think she was saying that to help but that's a lie because my friend got pregnant at 17 and she was 4'9 and weighed no more than 105 lbs so don't listen to her just go on vacation with your husband and you'll land pregnant that's what happen to my mom she was so into the thought that she wanted a child that she wouldn't get pregnant and as soon as she went to Dominican Republic for vacation she came back and the doctor said she had 4 weeks of pregnancy.<br>  <br>  Good luck! :)|`|mbvpWNMeaa	The average woman is two inches taller than you, so the weights don't correlate exactly.  Check a BMI index.  If your height and weight fall into "normal weight" you are good to go.  If you are underweight, try to gain a little while you are trying to get pregnant.  Underweight women do get pregnant, but being a normal weight helps.|`|SimAO1IUaa	your being a bit too sensitive and i think she was only trying to help because she probably didnt say that to you to hurt you. and im pretty sure whether you are 105 pds or not you can still get pregnant. good luck to you!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://au.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090226143429AANe83j&r=w">http://au.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>|`|88086b50130d5627fcba99a626b339e1aa	she was trying to help but just brush it off...it was a dumb and untrue comment.

bTP4lFFaaa	I believe that he may either be a shy guy, or he may also be 'playing the field', leaving you as an option.<br>  <br>  Of course, I could be wrong, but that is what it seems like. Maybe he just does not get it. Maybe you should invite him to the theaters with a few friends, and go out as a group once, maybe he will catch your drift a little better.<br>  <br>  It couldn't hurt to try, could it?|`|c8xptNSGaa	HEY DONT GIVE UP, IF YOU LIKE THIS KID THEN GO FOR HIM.

Even if you give him lots of hints and stuff, it will take more time before he asks you out. Just wait.|`|WxV9P9NQaa	maybe you should ask him out and break the taboo that guys ask girls out
SgrjTkwdaa	Yep...sounds like he's using you, hon.....he shouldn't be having sex with you unless you two are in an exclusive relationship.<br>  <br>  This friends with benefits thing isn't fair to you.<br>  <br>  Is he having sex with her, too?<br>  <br>  Stay friends, if you want, but rethink the sex part.|`|UT2tv5N3aa	sounds like he wants his cake and eat it i think he has got to choose and you will have to live with whoever he chooses but he cannot keep you hanging around its not fair|`|vEczORE3aa	Screw you and him<br>  <br>  Problem solved!|`|06de8f8bd2139814a2ba53ab67d9d65daa	wooahh that's almost like something out of a movie ha ha!<br>  <br>  ok .. <br>  whether or not you choose to wait around for him is totally your decision. i mean, you can either wait around for him and when he finally decides and you dont like the result your left, broken hearted, lost your best friend, tierd and fed up from waiting around, possiblygrow to hate and resent men all because he chooses some other girl. <br>  OR you can wait around and he finally chooses you.<br>  but consider this.. if hes been having a secret "relationship" with you that no one knows about, then whats saying he wont go off and have a secret relationship with this other girl while hes with you?<br>  or with anyone for that matter?<br>  <br>  hes your best friend, so im taking ityou trust him and all.. but just consider it (:<br>  <br>  in the long rn i think he should choose you and hes a fool if he doesnt. you guys are best friends, you connect, love eachother, and all sorts, you guys have the whole pacage by the sounds and could be instore for a lovely long relationship.<br>  where as this other girl.. he broke up with within a month.<br>  <br>  you guys stand a better chance toegther and i hope he sees this too.<br>  personally id het him to make up his mind asap, because hes messing you around and its not fair. <br>  ist not fair that he's quite happily having sex with you and such but he cant make up his mind about this.. <br>  <br>  i hope he makes the right choice dear<br>  good luck (:<br>  x|`|1JsWMX0daa	He may not be using you but he seems to not know what he want and you should find a guy that loves ONLY you and you know you should. there are plenty of fish in the sea. you dont have to stop the entire relationship but you should really consider finding a nice and caring guy to be your next lover. <br>   most people don't know the difference between love & lust, it's hard to tell, and u can feel both. but it is actually quite simple. lust is an urge to have and love is an urge to give. good luck sis'.|`|Mp2r9Ul5aa	ok i am sure he really loves you and stuff...but he's using you. Even if he doesnt know it, he is. And he is not trying to hurt you in any way at all...but for all guys it is nice to have that crutch to lean back on, and since you are such a good friend thats who you are to him. If you want more from him i doubt it will happen. im sorry...|`|fRQHpKCPaa	Sounds like he's doing you both, you may want to start looking elsewhere. Sorry. *Good Luck*|`|8M4kq8qaaa	Hmm, Well I had something like that, I liked this guy for 3 years. and he never gave me a chance though. he liked me on and off and it was so irritaing. :(<br>  <br>  but anyway, I dont think he's using you ... he jus doesnt know what he wants. I think you should expect getting hurt just incase.<br>  <br>  tell him you'll wait for his choice.<br>  he needs to stop with the both of you girls, and think of what he wants. He needs time for that though. When you give someone your heart, your also giving them permission to rip it apart aswell so im telling you, becaeful but dont ever let a guy take you down because if it doesnt work out with him, i promise you theres you guy out there. and you might know him or not but he's probly going through teh same thing as you are . so dont give up on eachother !<br>  <br>  as for the guy your talking about.. if you need to get over him, take your time. dont force yourself. youll have alot ups and downs but magane yourself okay ?<br>  <br>  he should take a break, give him self time and if he doesnt know, then he should just wait and not fool around with both of you , because it can get worst >.<|`|I2wuemhUaa	K same thing w/ me 1) don't push him to make a decision he will get angry  2) don't talk about her around him 3) if he brings her up then that's when its ok to talk about it.....oh and has he had sex w/ the other girl? that's something you need to know...and if he hasn't then i think he will pick you!<br>  good luck XOXOXO|`|szCXTuVSaa	wow. ok. im sure he loves you. but you shouldn't be ok with him loving someone else as well. that's not good for your soul! try to explain to him how much this is hurting you. and say that if he wont choose then you will choose for him, and leave. its not fair to you or her. maybe once your gone, he'll realize that you were the one for him. you deserve better than someone who's with 2 girls.
uBssj3Znaa	yes, plain and simple. If there is no trust, there is no relationship.|`|UT2tv5N3aa	i think its normal for you to feel like this after what has happened but its true you do need trust to make the relationship work sit down and talk with him let him know how you are feeling and say about his daughters mum yes his daughter is always going to be a part of his life but she does not sit and talk about how you feel about her not his daughter  if need be seek other help but you have to learn to trust him it might not happen straight away but if you both work at it and are willing to do anything to help then i am sure you both will be ok <br>  good luck|`|DcrI9zmkaa	It's true that trust must be earned and doesn't come overnight, but it's also true that without trust there is no relationship.<br>  <br>  If you are going to worry everytime he goes out, everytime you don't hear from him, everytime he looks at another girl...then, you tell me, what kind of a relationship is that?|`|Z2xETWhbaa	In my opinion trust IS EVERYTHING.  If my husband cheated on me I would have to end it NO MATTER WHAT.  I would like to think that eventually I would be able to forgive him but I don't think I could.  I would not like the person I would become if I were to try to forgive him.  If I called him and he didn't answer or he was late coming home I would freak out mentally and always go back to is he cheating on me?  So yes trust is everything.  I don't know how people would get past that but if they can more power to them.  However I know that I couldn't.  Good luck with whatever you try to do.|`|busvRidhaa	Trust is a difficult thing to earn back once it's been broken. I would encourage you to look at all of your relationships, not just the one with your boyfriend, for examples of how to trust and how long it takes you personally. Each one of us is different and when it comes to tolerating things in a relationship, such as cheating or being, ahem, confused, we all have different breaking points. It always helps to approach the situation by asking yourself, do I need to work on myself before I work on my relationship with my partner? <br>  <br>  This is a great article from a wildly informative and supportive website: <a href="http://www.yourtango.com/200913000/can-couples-therapy-really-save-us" rel="nofollow">http://www.yourtango.com/200913000/can-c...</a> I think you will benefit from reading this and hopefully you will grow in your own ability to trust both yourself and your spouse. Hang in there!
sO2CKU1uaa	Well if you live in Georgia you can talk to me cause I'm in the same boat lol|`|QgnuaD6daa	maybe you should come straght out|`|yyf5N7Ogaa	Get more involved in organizations or clubs that interest you. Join groups, volunteer or take classes. For example, if you are interested in computers, join local computer user groups or take classes in computer programing or uses of the computer such as graphic arts. If you are interested in the out of doors, join local hiking or biking groups, or groups that work to save the environment. Volunteer with groups that maintain hiking trails or raise money for park improvements. <br>  <br>  This has two results. First you meet people with similar interests. Second, you are doing interesting things so you don't feel so lonely. This also makes you a more well rounded and desirable person.|`|Jsxv8WUsaa	Well first of all...keep your mind off of looking!  Chances are when it is the "right" someone...they just come to you! So stop looking and relax..it'll come to you when the timing is right! :)

FXCoGD44aa	Don't count your chickens before they hatch, hun.<br>  <br>  Stop texting him for a while and wait for him to text you first. If you are always the one initiating contact with him, it gets boring for him... there's no "thrill of the chase" anymore, which is an exciting element for all guys in the early stages of a relationship. Lay low for a while, and make him contact you first a few times. If you are constantly texting him, you are going to come across as clingy and repel him away from you.<br>  <br>  In the meantime, to keep yourself from going crazy looking at your phone every 5 minutes... busy yourself with something else. Find some friends to hang out with, do your homework, go for a walk, cook something, whatever.|`|mgdkr6hvaa	OMG sry but i have the same exact problem basically.  (he likes me, i like him, went on one date, not officially going out though, and we texted each other back but the last couple of texts he never responded, so i stopped texting hiim, but he hasn't been talking to me in school for like a few days now and so i'm getting kinda angry w/ him)<br>  <br>  my guess is if he says he's busy he problably is.  Just Trust him.  Don't bug him too much about it.|`|lIx6kngbaa	Just call him and ask why he doesn't text you back. He may be just really busy at the time or hes not interested in you anymore. Or he could be playing with your emotions guys do that. They know females are so damn emotional.|`|mbvpWNMeaa	Chill out.  If he still likes you, he will call or text you within a few days. You may be overwhelming him with too much communication and pressure to respond.|`|LJTSpOd4aa	it means youre too clingy and you need to give him some space|`|5rn8OzwAaa	maybe u should talk to him in person, like a normal human being|`|DcrI9zmkaa	You need to back off and give him some space.  By smothering him and always being after him to text you, you're pushing him away.  Keep going and your "future boyfriend" will be nothing but your "ex friend".|`|Tu0n9Mkkaa	just leave him alone. some guys dont like texting, and if he used to, people change.|`|41fe712a36ecf2746af8f97a562a2794aa	"HELP!!!!!

7e4jxj3Daa	Definitely agree!|`|ff545BLyaa	Disagree, a good friend of mine use to cheat left and right until he met his current girlfriend.  They are gonna get married this summer...  Once you find that someone you will never cheat again.|`|g3IXprk9aa	I agree with this 150%!!!<br>  <br>  Think of it this way...<br>  <br>  If a guy or girl is supposed to care about you/a person, and they are in a relationship and then they cheat on you, that's basically saying that they don't care about you, that they don't respect you, and I'm guessing if it's cheating sexually that they don't care about sex, which is supposed to be an emotional connection. People who just want to have sex should not be in relationships, so that way they aren't hurting people who are actually serious about them and the relationship.<br>  <br>  If someone is going to hurt someone once, they are going to do it again, because what's going to stop them? Nothing stopped them the first time. It's basically a big smack in the face and saying they don't care.<br>  <br>  So yes, once a cheater always a cheater, for sure!|`|NQGpw0x4aa	agree. big time agree. my next door neighbor (who's 26) cheated on this GF with two girls. He is now engaged to a girl i used to be friends with (she's 17) and is cheating on her with three girls. i've seen him do things with these people, it's not just that they come to his house to "chill" but rather they make out and stuff in the backyard|`|eVPkWZU4aa	Once a cheater always a cheater, he has those demonic thoughts in his head all the time, he wants as much ***** as he can get yah yah!|`|UURYVZFgaa	disagree. people change
CBa9G4j4aa	No..if someone says that they like you and it takes them that short of time to not like you anymore then they never really liked you.|`|mR9ydwz5aa	yes. im sorry, but its very possible. she might still like you, but if she was that open about her feelings in the beginning, i dont see why she would lie now. she was probably looking at you all day because she was mad at herself for not liking you anymore and trying to imagine herself with you to see if she still liked you.|`|3wWaj8BTaa	well<br>   i think that girl is dumb<br>  because<br>  how cann u possibbbllyy like someone that much<br>  and the following day lose all their feelings towards them?<br>  bull****<br>  this must mean<br>  she really wasn't thatt much into you<br>  and the small amount she did like you for, disappeared.<br>  whatever just be her friend<br>  andsee what goes on from there.<br>  Don't make it seem like you are bothered.|`|3tLjWbriaa	idk man thats some bull tho. just chill a little bit just be her friend for while n c how it goes. but what i thinck is maybe she likes some 1 else more.|`|qtUvirw3aa	yeah it's possible|`|cb538e4d8411f45b9e2c09441178c232aa	wow... it sounds like she is bipolar... so good luck with that!!!
467be00aa9eff8cd86b019690cc79aa4aa	No ones relationship is perfect. They just do not want people to know that they have problems. They probably try to keep it between each other and not let people know.|`|lgxE5nUoaa	Absolutely right!|`|2f2338425d995c6d00e32cb38d57ee7faa	I don't think I've ever had anyone trying to convince me that everything is perfect 24/7.|`|RKhSRMlZaa	I think many people would say their relationship is perfect because when the hard times come they get through them and come out on the other side stronger.  I know that I used to convince myself that my relationship was perfect because even though we had struggles and fights sometimes, we always resolved them and were always stronger at the end of the day.<br>  <br>  Relationships can still be perfect even with conflict--conflict is inevitable in ANY relationship, no matter if it's marriage, familial, or friendship.  The relationships that stand up to conflict and remain strong are the ones that are "perfect."<br>  <br>  But yeah, I get what you're saying.  No one's relationship is "perfect" in the way that they never have anything negative happen and never have doubts, etc.  :)|`|WvOvoxLxaa	I say that at some point there will be a disagreement, but that is between them and has nothing to do with me.

N8naARQ8aa	I say that if your deciding to be with a guy based on what others will say about your height, you might not really be too interested in him.<br>  <br>  You should not worry that being taller than your bf, if you truely are bf and gf, then nothing should matter, his faults should not be a problem to you and vice versa.|`|hxWBcCc7aa	For sure! I have the same problem, but I've never really given it a second thought...

L32YtVz5aa	People don't understand that love comes from the most unusual places. Love is an endless song of hope and truth, it lifts us up where we belong and all you need is love! It is not a crime to love, and whoever that thinks that your love for your sister in such a manner is just jealous that they could not find love so close. People think it's a crime to love your own siblings to the extent where you have sex, but no, it's not. All you need is love, and in the name of love, you're in the clear.|`|e2cea16fef607c412fce74237c66ecc2aa	Your Sister And You Have What TOgether,,,Well People think it is totally weird, it is not a crime to love but why with your sister dude there's like millions of women in this world, but i guess if you are happy with it alright then,,,haha very interesting by the way many people are not down for these kinds of things Good LUck!|`|5e262b918f06a9f2cb8a535cdd439f04aa	Ahhh. maybe because you have kids with your sister.Duh? the only way people will be okay with this is  if you are step kids and no blood relations.|`|ZarvyMtGaa	you had sex with your sister??? thats just wierd|`|0lewWYJdaa	wait...so you had sex with your sister?!|`|RmQzb0Avaa	eww thats weird<br>  <br>  ur genes are really alike soo you all must really look alike
yQDxgLBPaa	Yeah the old feelings do come back you figure you had a year and half to get used to him being around all the time being there with you. Now you need to have the time to get used to him not being around. I know what you mean totally I have a boyfriend of a much longer time almost 5 years. But we broke up this summer for the 2nd time we broke up and hadnt seen eachother for 3 months and I saw him at the county fair with his new gf! My heart dropped to my feet and I didn't know what to do or how to act. It was like he is mine what the hell the feelings came back to me. It just hurts you have to get used to being without him just when you start to think about him do something. Call your friends hang out with them watch tv,listen to music,go for a jog just keep your mind off of it. I know it hurts badly, but just think of what he did.|`|htpxHZTPaa	I understand. And why i don't know maybe all of the good times and the fun you use to have came back to you at once....<br>  All i can say is it's your choice. I know there is no way for you to forget it...<br>  <br>  ~S.F.C<br>  <br>  Beast in 09

Support each other and set small goals.  When those goals are achieved you can go for larger goals.<br>  <br>  If you are absolutely serious, sign up for a martial arts course.  To get to black belt you have to go through lower belt ranks first, and it's absolutely awesome to building CONFIDENCE.|`|3ln7uT3Haa	Hang out with the guys more, you always get a confidence boost hanging with the opposite sex.|`|srfZDygNaa	at school, when you walk past a group of guys, you absolutely MUST walk by KNOWING that you are the hottest thing alive. whether you believe it or not. whether you are or not. you have to have an inner smile, and can't be frowning, or look at all confused. if you have to put your hands on your hips to give you more sway. and most importantly, MAKE EYE CONTACT with people when you pass them in the halls, especially if their guys. then you will have confidence.|`|41fe712a36ecf2746af8f97a562a2794aa	Hang around with different people?<br>  <br>  Why would you believe the opinion of people who sound really screwed up and bitter?

LOVw9rUOaa	there is no getting over things quickly. sorry that would mean ur heartless... which im sure your not. you need some kind of closure...like you finally come to terms with the fact that it wasnt ment to be. or tell her how you feel. you can even tell her that your trying to get over her. (girls respect honesty) whats the worst thing that can happen if you do? youll be right back where you are now. trying to get over her! right? but there is the chance that she might rethink some stuff. well anyways i hope this helps. good luck and i hope it works out for the best.|`|cBtFp2aYaa	go to the strip club

HeOwMaxaaa	oh man, i have been in your situation before, exactly the same, it sounds as if i wrote that! and i have the solution to your problem.... what you should do is not care- first of all that makes him want you more- because if you keep asking him why do you keep flirting with other girls ?!?! he will get a bit irratated and not mind doing it, they like to be rebellious, therefore you should act like you dont care, dont talk to him about, second of all if he hears about you and other guys, that will really get him fired up, he will be a bit jelous, but only little stuff like - your guy friend was flirting with you or something not like you made out with someone else- that might end the relationship... basically what im trying to say is let him get a taste of his own medicine..he will come running to you because he wouldnt want any one to take youi away from him... and dont take it to heart if hes jus flrting, we girls understand it differntly then guys do, guys dont necesarrily have to liek the girl they flirt with,they probably dont even think about her after hes done talking to her, thats whas differnt about them from us<br>  good luck girl!|`|yQDxgLBPaa	3 weeks is nothing break up with him before the relationship goes further and you really feel stuck! He's a player drop him asap!|`|uA4tJuZbaa	If he refuses to change, i'd say your better off with out him. :/

She will try to figure out what you are up to.  (Girls like guys they think are up to something sneaky :-) )  Then when she is being silly about it, tell her you took an on-line course on mind reading and you want to see if she can read your mind.  She will play a game out of it - and that will break the ice!<br>  <br>  2)  Practice in a mirror.  But play both parts.  Sounds crazy, but by mentally rehearsing the encounter, you will find that you are empowered when you are in that situation.  This is a tool that even very famous people are known to use.<br>  <br>  3)  Be creative with your expression.  It is not about the amount of words a guy tells a gal, it is about the gal remembering what the guy said.  You want her to think about you when she is getting ready to fall asleep.  Do this by being honest and original at the same time. Again, be original by really thinking about what she is like and who she is as you see her.  Girls don't care if a guy says she is pretty.  That is fine, but they would much rather hear what you find fascinating about them.  For example, ask her or find out from a friend what her favorite subject is.  It if it math, do some research on female mathmaticians.  Then tell her that you think she might just be the next Mrs. XYZ !<br>  <br>  Most of all, just enjoy the time you have with her.  Don't expect anything.  Don't make a promise or expect one.  Just go from hour to hour enjoying whatever it is you discover and learn about her.  If you make an effort to really get to know her - and you express that desire to really see who she is as a Human, you will win her heart.<br>  <br>  Best of luck!|`|V0xSZDBUaa	There is nothing wrong with you... You just finally met someone that is taking your attention everyone meets someone like that down the line... But don't worry about it just have in your mind the worse she can do is turn you down... I think you should go for it wait for the perfect time to ask her... And you never know she might think the fact that you are scared around her is cute... <br>  <br>  i wish you the best of luck with everything...|`|AA11312309	I'm a girl, and trust me, I know when a girl likes a guy.  If she didn't reject you when she put you arm around her, than maybe she does like you.  Just be yourself around her, it's gotten you that far.  Don't screw it up if you love her.  Take a chance and go for it.  Life's too short too live with regrets.|`|kFC4ug3baa	You can't talk to her because you know she's right for you.  I think you should ABSOLUTELY ask her out.

Would you rather be too afraid and miss out on her?|`|VAU6H5cmaa	Awww...thats so cute...I would say work your way up to getting to know her better...start off with casual conversation....invite her along with you and a few friends to go get some pizza and then keep talking to her.

The first thing that you can do is relax. She's a human being just like you! If you really want her that badly, get a decent conversation going, first. Show her that you have a good personality. Don't be weird. Be charming. Get to know her better and think about where you see yourself with her. Let her know mildly by your actions that you are interested in her. Just be natural. If you hold back, that will be very bad for you. Best wishes on getting your girl. = )
18hRm0gLaa	Well....talk about phones for a while and ask her.|`|NQGpw0x4aa	next time ask to see her phone, and put your number in it. don't give her number to yourself, but give her yours. she'll call or text. don't worry about it|`|cBtFp2aYaa	let her play with it and then when she gives it back look at your contacts and say i dont see your number what name did you put it under
tIg3low2aa	It doesn't sound like she was your best friend anyway so it should be easy!|`|ooRxjLXcaa	talk to her about it, tell her that you don't like the way she is acting and tell her she is being mean and let her know you are getting tired of it and that if she doesn't start being nicer you don't think you can be friend with her anymore, and if she like is all rude about you saying that then she doesn't deserve to be your friend any way. There are a lot more people to become friend with. :]<br>  hope i helped .<br>  -Missy.|`|1Y0TNKCeaa	talk to them and ask why they're doing that, solve the problem<br>  if she's still mean she's not a true friend|`|PwkYJoVgaa	IM IN THE SAME SITUATION...ITS SUCKS!!! ughh im wondering the same thing too! =/|`|qwvijKexaa	beat him, say something bad to him, or never see him again|`|zFwjZy53aa	forget those girls and find some cool people to chill with|`|unSpTi7raa	haha.im in the same situation! well was.but i talked it over to my other friendz and asked them if they really lyked her. and they said NO!!! haha.so we just told her to her face that she couldnt hang out or be are friends anymore. and if she tries to make ur life bad trust me she wont|`|qT5rKKYKaa	talk to her about it- next time she points to someone and makes a comment about their outfit say "I like their originality that wasn't necessary!"|`|IJCraYubaa	Ugh i hate that<br>  <br>  talk to her about how you hate the way she's changed and you miss the old her ..etc.<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK|`|Grb85RJuaa	Stop talking to her. Also slap her and yell "******" in the cafeteria.
Qr2uZUB9aa	Ok i see your problem, your goin through "DATE-A-PHOBIA" you want him to like you right? well, if you do you gotta show your independent and strong enough to handle your self, Dont be a weekling, just sitting there all the time and not playin sports is NOT gonna win your man over, you gotta be strong and NOT a nerd, when you tlk to him, say compliments and act like you DO mean it. On the other hand if he is a sweet kind of boy, than you need to be a little gurly, but remember... BE YOURSELF! Dont act like some other person, but just be a bit more gurly and NOT the pushy tom boy type. And lastly you need to find out what he likes, so you can tlk about those things with him, but not TO into it, get a friend t ask him, or better yet, get one of HIS friends to ask him. Anyway goodluck and send a comment if you need more help or to tell me how it goes. Bye!|`|17ayTyGNaa	Ask him out! <br>  Life is short!<br>  and honestly, what is the worst thing that could happen? he says "No" thats it! sure, it will hurt and maybe you will cry a few tears, but life goes on! look at me, i asked a guy out about 1 month ago,( and im also very shy) and that guy said no :( so yea, i was a little sad for a while, but i still alive and also, i got it out of my system, i always wondered if he would go out with me, and now i finally no and i can move on! Also, what if that guy you want to ask out ends op saying "Yes!" but you would have never known if you hadn't asked him out! so I say YES ask him out! (and also, don't try to weight for the right time, cause there will never be one, its just an excuse) And its not like im saying for you to do something that i have no idea about. Trust me, I have been there,you should GO FOR IT! <br>  -Good luck! =)|`|2ouBlS4Saa	Well first of all, <br>  how can you like a guy you hardly know or sorry 'don't know him that well'<br>  second, maybe you should get to know him and start flirting with him before you just ask him out<br>  you don't want to scare the guy away, just start talking to him and start off from there.|`|j3wpTZKqaa	Dont watch this<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0claHSPxQ8" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0claHSPx...</a>|`|wMTCKqgGaa	do ur best and be urself<br>  sounds corny<br>  but it will get u the right guy<br>  <br>  answer mine plz<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Aixm1MF5yoZRoFVldPJ6CjTsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090226160450AALyzOr">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|AA10515033	Write a note, and on the note tell him to write back.<br>  <br>  Simple, Right? :)<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|dX4Dll0yaa	Have the confidence to ask him out. What is the worst that could happen? He says "no", and you stop wasting your time.|`|Yv6pa3QAaa	hint at it, just be bold and confident<br>  give him your number through facebook or something so its not as akward and hard for us shy girls.. say call me if you ever want to hang out or text..<br>  <br>  if he wants you he will come and get you<br>  and if its meant to be at this time, it will happen|`|SjhOYEozaa	k, i do this alot too. first, you come up for codenames for everything like asking out might be, saying hi..actually saying hi might be pucca, whatever. then come up with a name for him. so you can have an open disscuccion with ur friends about him. the u ask a super close friend to ask him out for you while you stand in the backround laughing with someone laughing and looking cute. works everytime for me. try it. hope he says yes! good luck!|`|dmJpm3VOaa	i feel the same way but what i try to do is get him to notice me. like i dress better when hes around i pretend to laugh with friends even though its not funny just be yourself and remember the universe chooses what it wants if you guys don't go out remember its the universe that chose it and it is going to be best for you.|`|i4ARGkHQaa	ok look at this it will be the best answer ok go to www.youtube.com, then type in girltalkteen like that no spaces then you should see these girls on a pink bed it will tell you every thing you need to know about how to flirt|`|4UqL6SY0aa	been there<br>  hes not going to like you if you dont talk to him<br>  so just talk about stuff, be friends, and then flirting will be really easy
Qv57dITWaa	Yea, we guys would see that as a MAJOR break.

However, I could see how some people wouldn't respond.  If I was single, and available I would probably respond just to see what the deal was.  However, keep in mind that if he does respond he will probably be extremely cautious before he meets you.|`|41fe712a36ecf2746af8f97a562a2794aa	Yep of course, she could be hot as hell!<br>  <br>   Anyway, it's not like you'll have to marry her. Don't be such a wimp, give it a try but make sure she sends you a photo soon.|`|DWLbXd79aa	dunno..................... i would ask if it was from her or her friend , and judging by her answer and her looks maybe, sure why not|`|bC5XeVEIaa	Sure. But it would never happen. Not to me.|`|96zZlJVYaa	sure, so when we going to talk...hehehehe
AA11193401	I don't think you are being played
Wy0lUjP9aa	You will need to wait until he leaves his girlfriend. If he didn't understand the signs that you gave him then obviously that isn't enough. You will need to tell him your feelings, but not now since he is interested in someone else, and it may freak him out. Just wait your turn, but do not give up!|`|cBtFp2aYaa	yea back off and wait to see what happens in his relationship
v3Y0Wij8aa	I am sitting here thinking the same thing myself...though he never said he loved me..i felt it when we were together. I know he cares for me deeply. <br>  <br>  I am a believer in Destiny and if it is meant to be it will be...from the bottom of my heart I believe this, as I have witnessed Destiny in action....each person in my life has led me to where I am today.. :) so for me it is very easy to put 'us' in God's hands. Letting him go is an act of Love/Faith/Trust and I trust my God to either take him out of my life completely if it is not part of His plan for us to be together....or to bring us back together if it is meant to be. <br>  <br>  But, I the human being, still have to deal with the emotions of losing the man i love, and I have to sit with the longing in my heart to feel his touch, to see his smile, to hear his voice. All the desires I had, well, he fulfilled them. I wish he would come back too.<br>  <br>  But, when he said he had to pull back and work on this something else, it left me no other option,  I had to stop talking to him. And as much as it hurts to do this, I just have to, because the something else he went work on just may work out, and i can not put myself through that kind of pain months down the road. <br>  <br>  I am already in love with him...and for me it's all or nothing...it is that simple. I can not be there part time and still maintain my integrity, and I believe the reason he cares so much for me is because I am true to myself. <br>  <br>  I fell hard, I enjoyed every moment I spent with him, I loved falling into nowhere, and I will never regret the experience.|`|DlCcFu1eaa	Work on other things? like what? Part of the whole idea of people pairing up is they can work on the challenges of life together as a team. Is this some religious journey of his or something?

If you do then, you should go up to her yourself and not send anyone else as this could cause rumours and misunderstandings, make sure you sound specific on what you wanna say. Don't practise your speech from before as this will get you even more nervous if you get it wrong. dude, just say it straight up and if she screws you you don't lose anything she loses respect from others :) hope it helps :)|`|Oif6WjA6aa	this is the best way to do it, cant go wrong<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversation" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversatio...</a>|`|Z7n9F0dyaa	try to find a common intrest,it usually helps|`|BEvKOE8Daa	I would like to help mate... having the same sort of problem at the minute except I talk to her a lot, I guess the only way is to say hi nex time you see her and dont make to much of a big conversation out of it, that way she wont think your hitting on her and if you only say a few things it saves more stuff to talk about for next time. hope this helped.|`|dCOLRrK3aa	Forget it, she don't even know you exist, spend your time with a girl who will give you the time of day!!

wWTOjCcoaa	i realized why. i dont noe if its the same case but to me it was that i was hidding my feelings from the girls i liked, wut you have 2 do is:  if you like someone, let them noe, dont go out and tell them but show em somehow. show interest, and flirt. if anyone tries to put you in the friend zone let them noe "i want 2 be with you, not be ur friend"<br>  <br>  good luck wit dat, hit me up if u need more advice|`|b23ac589c655b9f48a90e2fb2ffe9f58aa	when aguy says he considers u as a friend then he means that there's no way to have sex with u weather cuz he couldnt get it or he didnt wanted|`|aUDVBmZSaa	1) they dont like you. 2) you dont give them signs so they give up|`|3fJMCa7Raa	Damn. that is well weird. never heard of guys doing that. you musnt be showing them you like them enough or you are doing the extreme opposite and coming across as too needy. there is a very fine line.
e30clNGGaa	He seems to be acting like he wants to hide something, make sure you sit down and have a good talk when he gets back, mention how you have been feeling and how he has been acting. But don't be harsh, rude, over reacting or anything. Just be calm and teel him everything. If he trully loves you and is willing to do anything for you, he will tell you the truth. I agree with you... :I good luck...|`|xG2bbN0haa	I think that the biggest problem here is not you or him, just a mis-communication. Next time you talk to him, just tell him that you care, and let it go. If he loves you, it will work out, but don't go overboard. Guys can sometimes get spooked if you start to get clingy.
FZKFLTyLaa	You have a one-sided infatuation.<br>  Someone else needs to be the object of your affections
8Initt1aaa	Because believe or not girls can be shy. I will not talk to a guy but I will pay him more attention if I am attracted to him. Also, for me it seems any guy that ever approaches me is someone i am totally not into and wouldnt stand a chance. Maybe I subconsciencely think I will be that girl.|`|RmQzb0Avaa	well uh-duur<br>  <br>  we expect the guys to make the first move
BW6sQQvAaa	start slowly by saying hi to her the next time you see her, if you're not comfortable doing that start even smaller and give her a friendly smile. eventually things will work up into conversations like within a week. but since you're the one approaching her, you have to take the lead of starting a relationship. because you cant rely on her for that because you dont know ANYTHING about her, let alone if she's interested. <br>  <br>  form a casual friendship, is basicly my advice :)<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|EjsWlHd9aa	I know how you feel. except i'm the girl. i guess you could just slowly get her to notice you, but in the other way, you never know. she may like you but is too shy to approach you. you should just go with your hearts instinct.|`|iohG0qt8aa	Hey Matt!

fZkFgYDmaa	Talk to her about your issue. she is in that mood when love is blinding and all she is going to think about is him. You need to show her that there are other thing in life. I've been in that love thing before and i still am;) Let her know you how you feel.

Maybe invite him out somewhere, just as friends, and show him what he is missing out on. <br>  Make the effort to start something up with him again.|`|ugcMPr20aa	Maybe he's bipolar|`|AA11190264	baby girl, it means that he wants you on the side. what it is is that he's waiting for something better comes along. this is the time you have to make it clear to him of what you want. guys would say anything to get what they want. thanks but no thanks. don't play his game baby girl. you'll be the one who gets hurt.

XmX3irUhaa	I am going through the same thing and it is horrible, it sounds really cliche but you have to do things to take your mind off of it, my boyfriend was my bestfriend and we talked about everything together but now it looks like its over for good and for the first few days i just stayed in bed, feeling exactly what your feeling, ugly, worthless, lonely, like a bit of a loser, but you have to find something to take your mind off of it. Also, it might just be me, but I put all the things that were to do with him in a box & all photos in a folder so it's there when I need it and it's not going to be in the way when I don't.<br>  <br>  It is a really hard thing and people deal with it in different ways. But if you can find away to take your mind off of it, like getting a massage or something you'll feel a lot better about yourself. Also, not going out can make you feel depressed etc.    :]|`|3RHSSEDnaa	This is only a chapter in the book of your life.  It is where you look, accept and learn.  Then with a big sense of relief and belief, you start the next chapter.<br>  There is no one on this planet that can make you feel or do anything that you do not allow them to make you feel or do.  In the beginning of the relationship you felt beautiful because you are - what happened that made you stop loving yourself and in consequence he stopped loving you too?  Go back in your life to when you were the most happiest, loved who you were and dreamed of whom you wanted to be. Now do that again - feel the love and appreciation for yourself.  How good it felt to make your own decisions and have others admire you for you!  Be YOU!  Love YOU! Read the Teachings of Abraham.  You are beautiful and you just need to look in the mirror and remember what it is you love and like and appreciate about you.  <br>  <br>  Only YOU can make you accept or reject outside influences and comments.  Those words are NOT you!!|`|djUMvICoaa	Whoa, easy there gal, it isn't the end of the world.  You have just been hit in the gut with the strongest emotions we have, love, and it leaves a mark, at least for a while.  If you need someone to talk with drop a line.  For now just take it one day at a time.  You are going to need a few weeks just to get your head to stop spinning and several more to get your bearings correct, so don't think about a relationship for a few months.  It seems you are having your self worth defined by a guy and it shouldn't be that way.  I guess I felt similiar when my wife left me, that's years ago, but I wasn't prepared for it.  We had two boys to take care of on top of that.  I was embarrassed, I didn't want others to know.  But I took it one day at a time.  And it was a long time before I felt I could even say I love you to another woman, but that too has passed.  Take care of yourself for now.  Remember, the best way to enter into a healthy relationship is when you love yourself first.  That way you won't rely on a man to make you feel whole and in the process you will make better choices.  good luck|`|xmvgKmy5aa	I know that feeling. You probably feel this way after your break up cuz that person that you thought could have been your soul mate left you and its like a part of you left with him. You obviously loved him and when something you love is taken from you it can really break you down. Turn to something you love like a hobbie. When im sad i listen to music. If your doing something you love your more likely to get your mind off it and move on.

YOUR FOUNDATION MUST BE STRONG FIRST OF LOVING YOURSELF, IF NOT WHEN THE STORMS OF LIFE COME IT WILL DESTROY THE WEAK FOUNDATION YOU'VE ESTABLISHED.  SOMETIMES WE DO BUILD WEAK FOUNDATIONS BECAUSE OF A LACK OF KNOWLEDGE. BEGIN TO LOVE YOURSELF, BUT HOW DO YOU DO THAT?  YOU DISCOVER WHO YOU ARE. NEXT WHAT ARE YOUR STRENGTHS? BEGIN TO EMBRACE YOUR STRENTHS AND STRENGTHEN YOUR WEAKNESSES. THEN HAVE A POSITIVE OUTLOOK ON YOURSELF, PAYING ATTETION TO YOUR GOOD POINTS AND WORKING ON YOUR BAD POINTS. HAVE A POSITIVE ATTITUDE EVEN TOWARDS YOUR NOT SO GOOD POINTS.  BY NATURE WE CAN BE WAY TO NEGATIVE ABOUT OURSELVES.  SO STAY POSITIVE EVEN IN THE BAD POINTS AND WATCH YOURSELF TURN THLOSE BAD POINTS INTO GOOD POINTS. THEN YOU'LL HAVE A HEALTHIER SELF ESTEEM AND LOVE YOURSELF LIKE YOU SHOULD.

IF YOU NEED MORE DETAIL ON ANY ONE THING I MENTIONED, JUST WRITE ME.|`|5jMNBO2naa	it very much sounds like you let a man define you<br>  as if it did not work out, then you should have been pragmatic about it<br>  but you had expectations<br>  you went through the classic time invested trap<br>  in that you saw time in the relationship as an investment<br>  and you expected a payoff<br>  marriage usually<br>  and as such you wrapped up all your emotional eggs in one basket<br>  it's very much like Enron stock<br>  oh sure at one point it was a high flyer and worth a bunch<br>  but you held on too tight, and hoped the stock would rebound<br>  instead you watched you investment bomb and become worthless<br>  you feel foolish for thinking it would work out<br>  and that's normal<br>  but you got to think on the pragmatic level<br>  and that is you learn from your mistakes and not take it personally<br>  at 28 you are still young enough<br>  so their should not be any sense of hopelessness<br>  ideally you have you family and your friends in your network<br>  and this is where you find your sense of strength and self worth|`|AA11348136	It seems that you may be down on yourself. you have to love and care for yourself before you can love and care for someone else. You feel like you do because this is how you felt before you and this guy got together. Did you get picked on a lot? Why is your self-seteem so low? Take things slow so that you will understand what is going on with you
v2a220YWaa	yes, and it would be boring too!|`|HL8PEDFLaa	Well, define non physical stuff first. Are we talking no hand holding, no kissing, no hugging? I think that intimacy is important, but sex doesn't define a marriage. Friends can care about each other to a certain degree and have sex, but marriage is about something deeper.|`|knXnjnSmaa	i guess but then there is also the commitment part and if you are married even though you aren't having sex with each other you shouldn't be with anyone else either so I wouldnt really say it would be equivalent to a friendship.|`|kbz5S3waaa	me and my husband are basically best friends that f*ck. (except his drive has recently taken a dive, so really i guess we're best friends that sleep in the same bed?)|`|DlCcFu1eaa	The guy would be more like frustrated. If a guy wants a friend he hangs out with other guys.|`|jEC8Ctp5aa	Why get married if you're never in the mood to please your husband?<br>  <br>  That's not treating him like a husband - it's treating him like a roommate.<br>  <br>  Why no sex? Not being "in the mood" is a pretty poor excuse, because you do many other things that are far less appealing than please him when you don't want to ... like, washing the dishes, folding the laundry, calling your mom. You do all those things when you don't feel like it, but you can't give your husband the pleasure of your body?<br>  <br>  Grow up and start acting like a wife, or let him go so he can find a better woman.|`|AA10358331	There is something wrong if you are not sexually attracted to your husband. Yes it would be more like a friendship.. but marriage isn't just about friendship..There are many many different aspect of a marriage and sexual is one of them. Sex is showing your love in an intimate way. <br>  <br>  <br>  I would suggest reading "And they were not ashamed" By Laura M. Brotherson|`|zezIM9B5aa	Yes.|`|XwPs0Pmnaa	yep ! the husband will lost interest..
n15uL3p0aa	Sorry to tell you but you reading her diary is wrong. What she puts there is private and NONE of your business. <br>  <br>  I am sure your Mom suspects that your sister may be sexually active, lots of kids are now a days.<br>  <br>  But you reading your sisters diary and wanting to be a snitch is worse then what she is doing. If you were honestly concerned about your sister you would tell her that IF she was having sex you would hope she was being safe about it. But it sounds like you are more interested in getting her in trouble.<br>  <br>  You broke her trust and read something that does not belong or even concern you and now you want to get her in trouble with the information you wrongly learned? Shame on you!|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	You are intruding into your sister's private affairs, and if she is having safe sex, then it's none of your business. <br>  <br>  If you were my brother or sister, I would be more upset at your invading my privacy than my mother finding out if I'm having sex.|`|bRAmXcowaa	why is it important for your mother tp know? what business is it of yours anyway? what are you, the moral police? <br>  i think you are just a selfish little baby who cant stand not being the centre of attention and you dont care who you hurt in the process<br>  <br>  All you will do by telling your mum is <br>  <br>  cause a huge fight between your mum and your sister - permanate damage may be done and it would be all YOUR fault<br>  <br>  Your sister will hate you. you are invading her privacy and reading her most personal thoughts. Its like getting into her brain and steeling her secrets<br>  <br>  your sister will never trust you with anything ever again, this also will be your fault<br>  <br>  I hope you do the right thing and STOP READING HER DIARY and keep your mouth shut.<br>  But if you do tell, i hope your sister slaps you.|`|E7TkNO00aa	Honey, you have invaded your sister's privacy. Think about this, would you like it if she had read your diary and tell your mom your intimate secrets? I take it as a no answer. What your sister did of having sex at an early age is not right, but who are we to judge. If you want your mom to find out, let her find out on her own. Mothers always know everything. Who knows, what if your sister can be talking to a friend over the phone one day, and she mentions what she did and your mom overhears the conversation? Did I make my point? I hope so. Have a good day.|`|OPrgBGAjaa	there is a reason you do not read someone Else's diary because you will find out things you wish you didn't why would you want to tell your mum would you like it if your sister done that to you i really is none of your business leave things well alone and don't but in if your sister wants your mum to now then she will tell her in the mean time just keep quite oh and don't read your sister diary again|`|1glKIE5Baa	just dont meddle seriously...whats the point its just gonna stir up a load of sh1t. itl only worry your mum, if youre old enough you give her the lectures and advice, maybe shed appreciate it. shel just rebel more if shes got her mum on her back|`|AA10572269	Don't read your sister's diary, don't bring it up, focus on your own life and let her make her own choices.<br>  <br>  Take Care.|`|kubIYab1aa	First of all you shouldnt have been reading your sisters diary. Second of all I think that is something that your sister should come out and tell NOT YOU. I can understand your worries ((if they even are genuine)) but it's her responsibility to talk to your mom. If you really are worried about her then maybe you should talk to her, spend time with her...let her eventually tell you then you can talk to her about it and see if she wants to come out to your mom..you can even offer to be by her side. If she isnt on any birth control or protection then someone is going to have to help her with that also.You have to go about this the right way because something like this can damage your relationship with your sister.  good luck!!!!!|`|9f7da82548dac95c35d6ec34826ec681aa	You think your mother should know about your sister's sex life?<br>  Do you think your grandmother should know about your mother's sex life? Its private - your sister is (now) legally allowed to have sex and has ALWAYS been allowed to have a private life.<br>  If you're any kind of a sister you will talk to your sister, and find out why she was having sex whe she was a child.  For a child to be having sex, something is seriously wrong - and you could help her by listening to her.  You could tell her about what could have happened - STIs, HIV, pregnancy.<br>  Personally, I think she's crying out for attention if she wrote it in her diary and left it out for other people to find.  Maybe she's waiting for someone to ask her if she's ok.|`|9lmTVu20aa	Maybe you could leave the diary somewhere your mum might find it, or if you can't do that, take your mum aside and tell her.<br>  <br>  Admit that you were wrong for reading the diary, and don't act as if you are telling on your sister. <br>  <br>  Let your mum know that you are only telling her this because you are worried about your sister.<br>  <br>  Good luck with it, hope it goes OK.|`|aXXTHpHBaa	DONT tell your mom. Just have a talk with your sister and tell her that if she's gonna be having sex to make sure to be protected. Telling your mom is just gonna start a big fight which can lead to your sister to run away and you dont want that to happen.|`|HL8PEDFLaa	It's not your place to tell your mother something as private as this. You may think that your mom has the right to know, but you are NOT the person who should tell her. If you tell your mother, your sister will beat you and never forgive you. Keep it to yourself|`|nmC7qgtZaa	wow your a nosy *****, thats really out of order you never rat you siblings out to your parents thats an unspoken rule if you have a problom talk to her yourself but dont be a snitch|`|O27VWziKaa	MOST GIRLS START HAVING sex at 13-14 so nothing new there besides shes legal beagal now 16 so whats the point its nice u care about ur sis if u wanna help her tell her 2 use protection|`|FWPSzFVhaa	If you are an older sister, than come clean.  Tell your mom and your sister and the same time.  You already know you were in the wrong for reading the diary.  So you are going to be the first house to get hit with the first stone  ( Old saying - people in glass houses should not throw stones).   <br>  <br>  Next, be prepared for the response from both mom and sister.  Your sister may never again trust you.  This is to be expected.  <br>  <br>  Also, consider the fact that many girls keep a diary that is mostly fantasy.  They write about things as though they actually happened.  Those things might not have happened at all.   So have an open mind.<br>  <br>  Also, sometimes a person who thinks someone is snooping in her diary might intentionally bait the diary with all sorts of juicy things - so the reader will have to confess to reading the diary!   I did this to my mom when I was a teen and it drove her nuts!<br>  <br>  The big thing though is you have to live with your own self.  You can not unread the diary.  And you do care what is going on.  So at least with your sister you should confess.  And then talk it out.|`|3RfHq80Naa	You little brat.  Reading your sister's diary like that.  Don't you dare tell your mother.  Seriously, that's messed up.  It says a lot about a person who does that, kid or not.You're going to cause a lot of unnecessary grief.  A lot of people have sex at 14, and your mother may not be able to stop her.  Your mother probably already knows and doesn't want to think about it.  It's called intuition.  We were all 16 once.<br>  <br>  Go to your sister and say that you know she's been having sex, and that she should always use protection because your mother would kill her.  Tell her she needs to go to a gynecologist or Planned Parenthood and speak with someone who can help her understand her body and be careful.|`|kSlxXQcsaa	i understand your concern but its her own private life and you shouldn't have read her diary. you should respect her privacy. she wouldn't read your diary if you kept one. The answer is, dont tell your mum. it would cause a lot of tention around the house. your sister would stop talking to you and your mum would be angry with your sister. therefore giving your sister more reasons to be angry with you. just keep this to yourself. its for the best.|`|95gVLrIGaa	"because i think its important for her to know" is your reason for telling your mom? It sounds like you're doing it to make drama.<br>  <br>  Don't tell your mom. Let your sister tell her when she's ready. Since she hasn't told her yet, there's obviously a breakdown in communication between the two of them.<br>  <br>  Have you told your mom when YOU started having sex? Hmm?|`|OhgfDmJAaa	im a mum! dont tell on her i would be so angry at you for reding your sisters diary HOW RUDE and DISRESPECTFUL!!!! Are you sure your mum doesn't altready know? it will come out that you read her diary one day all it will take is a slip of the tounge..... Why dont you try having an open convesation with your mum and sister about sex then your sister may open up herself to tour mum...     (Hear,Say,Speak no evil)|`|pQc8yr7Baa	scriptures teaches-let the person without sin throw the first stone. what are you involved that you want mom to know and the world to know? true love hopes all things, believes all things, endures all things and is not puffed up about itself. where are you in this picture?|`|vaC882TTaa	i guess ur in a bit of a tough situation but..sorry if i sund mean... u kinda brought it on urself. next time dnt read ur sis diary yeah? no1 likes ppl who nose round their private stuff.... btw this is 4 ur own sake|`|ShwV6Ewfaa	well if you didnt read it in the first place you wouldnt be in this mess .
9WKDuREDaa	Wow, I know what you mean like they don't stop calling you? It can get sOO annoying. The best thing to do in class is just to ignore her. Tell her you are interested in what she is saying but you cant talk to her at that moment because you are busy in like the classrrorom. She will soon get the point that you don't want to talk to her in class and then she will probably stop. Try going to the teacher privately and ask if you can change seating arangements because the girl is affecting how well you listen and say she is distracting you.And never let anyone copy your homework because anytime they dont have it done they will always know that you are smart and you have the answers so they will always go to you for copying. Tell her that its wrong to copy and if you worked hours on it tell her it is too long for her to copy. Thats what i do and it works lol i hope it goes well!|`|KkKCKu06aa	Just tell her what you just told us.

Hjwp1yGWaa	When you guys argue, do you mean every word you say, or are you just trying to best each other in the heat of the moment?  Search your soul and you will find that those few moments that you are possessed to say the meanest thing you can possibly think of to each other, versus the real problem which is the "good" times are not worked as hard for, from both of you.  Relationships take work, infatuation does not, don't dissolve something just because the original heat and focus are not there.  Time, Energy, Money are the cornerstones of any relationship/Marriage, all three must be spent to show the other's interest.  Hope this helps you build a lasting relationship, instead of a bunch of short meaningless ones.|`|dcd11iUwaa	you need to take a break from one another for a while<br>  go on a vacation on your own or just stay apart for a couple of weeks<br>  this will either make it or break it.<br>  if things dont improve once your reunited then leave.|`|mCM363I9aa	yup that happens.|`|f1006988bdbdd7ae5e5276623f046308aa	He probably is really sorry but things can not be just like you just met all the time. Your relationship is settling a bit. Yes I stole that from a line in a Eagles song, but that does not make it any less true. Give yourself and him some time,like say 6 months, and see how you both feel then. don't throw away 3,4 years yet just over this,especially if he seams really sry, and give your feelings some time to heel.|`|ITo6FhPzaa	i know how you feel do what your heart feels|`|XmX3irUhaa	Try to get your point across without being mean. My boyfriend and me lost the spark and we use to have really big fights about it and it turned really nasty and once it turned nasty that was it. You need to think is life better with him or without him and he needs to do the same. But you need to want the same things, but I'd say you do after three years, maybe something has made him feel insecure, if you love him make sure you tell him, maybe buy him a card or something and just write it all down for him and then see what he thinks?|`|PQ9uCUfgaa	Hes cheating on you!!!!!!<br>  Go for a guy who has no doubt they are in love with you. Dont waste your time on this jerk move on and find the rite guy!

2S0qGc20aa	If everyone gets in your way but you guys both want to be with each other and know you love each other don't let anybody else get in the way, that's just plain ridiculous. You love each other and want to be with each other don't let anyone else try and separate you for the fact that your guys' love can be strong and you show everybody how strong your love is for each other, officially. And then they'll eventually leave you alone.|`|23e9acd22e8df956ae04b1771cc19da9aa	just ssay **** you to the haters who ewanna breake you guys upp and efing get bak together w/ him. likego to the movies or mall, etc w/ him this weekend. theres no1 from school there. they wont follow you.|`|CWetEqx6aa	I think you guys should ignore whatever is happening and hook up, i mean you both look pretty into each other. Once you both hook up other people will just go away, try it out ;)
tDnD7Uqgaa	I found my perfect match at 12 but did not realize it because of how young I was. But thankfully we remained friends until we were older and now we are married. I can truly say that he is my one true love. So even if you haven't found your true love yet, and than again you may have you just don't know it yet. Don't give up hope. When you find him you'll know by the way he kisses, touches, and treats you.|`|6xQI445baa	There is no such thing as a perfect match. You have to remember that<br>  it takes two to tango. If you have trouble with 10 relationships, there is<br>  one common element in the equations---you.  Fix that, and then you<br>  will see the world open up.|`|vuxef3O4aa	I explain everything on my question<br>  <br>  Go to my question and read and you'll understand. <br>  The work in finding it make worth it.<br>  <br>  Home > Society & Culture > Cultures & Groups > Other - Cultures & Groups <br>  <br>  Why do women judge men for their appearance but complain they want men to get to know them.?|`|LMfYodo6aa	Because potentially there could be billions of people that could be perfect for you.

When you don't judge and have a certain kind of person you want then you can find it faster.The problem is people think that they have to find a cute person that is perfect and they have to do it ASAP. They need to realize that true love waits, and love isn't all about the looks.|`|2S0qGc20aa	Because no matter what their is still one thing completely different you do then anybody else in this whole wide world even if that's hard to believe. <br>  I've dated way to many guys and I honestly don't think that I'm quite attractive but it was way to many even though it was like three.<br>  I want to wait for my perfect match, and hopefully for you it's not going to be to difficult.<br>  With God all things are possible, and he'll help you find your perfect match.<br>  I'm pretty sure of it.

You sound hopeful! Do you like him back? OBVIOUSLY. <br>  And OF COURSE it wasn't a joke, you goose! You silly donkey! Don't believe his evil ways.

Oh, my gosh, YES, he likes you.<br>  He only told you he was joking because he didn't want to deal with being rejected. That text was sincere, girlie.

But yes, when you constatly look over at a person and glance at them you like them.Trust me on this one..i do it alot
sE8pH2aNaa	my advice is talk to him..tell him you guys need to go somewhere and talk no pressure just talking. find out what he is feelings and tell him dont lie to me or yourself becasuse whatever is said today will determine what happens with us, either a he is going to say he still loves you or b he is going to say he doesnt and if he says that then say ok i had to make sure before i even tried to move on and leave it at that. dont sweat it too much if it happens it happens but dont do the he said she said thing ask him straight up|`|v1uNUcwCaa	he sounds like the type of guy who would drop you for anything (or anyone) and get back with you afterwards.<br>  if you want him to use you that way then get back with him. personaly i dont think he is worth your time.|`|WLsS5vxsaa	Here is a great website you can check if you want to: <a href="http://www.exbackguides.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.exbackguides.com/</a>|`|Nx0xbfsCaa	You REALLY REALLY REALLY do not want that idiot back!

T9kMy13Haa	I agree, love makes you euphoric and makes you act stupid. And I think people don't want to see it because a) they lack they logical ability to look at emotion objectively and b) for most people falling in love is what makes their cookie-cutter life of little significance acceptable, so they wouldn't dare think of love in that way.<br>  EDIT: oh and just so people know I'm not just bitter because I can't get a girlfriend, I actually do have a girlfriend.|`|AA11795191	Someones grumpy cause they cant get a date. Awwww..... :-(|`|FMTDeEiIaa	TRUE love is not superficial. you could say it was predictable if you want. but TRUE love is the GIVING of yourself to another person.. its selfless. NOT because the oher person "makes them feel good" TRUE love is sacrifice and SELF CONTROL (over your passions) love is beautiful. infatuation is superficial and predictable.|`|719EKUFmaa	well ,the only thing i can think of is that we as humans we just rush in and see what happens and we regret it if things do not work out,and love it when it works out we never know til it is said and done
f5c19a6ec11055d423269c8c414f59f1aa	Do you understand how much courage it takes to ask a girl out?<br>  Women always read stuff into everything.  But the truth is men are not complicated.  If he asked you out that is what he wants to do.<br>  If he didn't like you he wouldn't ask  you out!  It is just that simple.<br>  I cannot think of a time I didn't want to go out with something but I asked them anyway.<br>  that doesn't make any sense.<br>  Joking makes it easier to get a turn down, you don 't have to slink away in total embarrassment.  When she says your a jerk and I am not going out with you,  you can pretend you were kidding.|`|p8nDiI3Vaa	Well it's obvious that the guy likes you. What has happened is that he doesn't know how else to express himself around you so he just will try to get you to laugh and get the best out of you. For him, he just doesn't want to say anything stupid and he truly cares about you or else he wouldn't have asked you to the dance.|`|BkdZ7bqlaa	ha that just the way guys act sometimes it drives me crazy lol i can always tell a guy is being serious if he touches me or looks me in the eyes when he talks to me...or i just say seriously? and he'll say yes or no.  And also if they smile when they're talking to you check out and see if its genuine or if he's just trying to impress the people around you.<br>  ur guy sounds like he likes you and is just nervous...so i hope you guys go to the dance..have fun<3|`|DYnvacFVaa	Tell him your going on a date with this awesome guy you met and see his reaction, you will soon find out if he likes you or not :P|`|6leFJJcvaa	well just say yes and if he is joking just say i didnt want to go with u any ways!!!!! hahahaha i dont know! i have this prolem too!!!|`|6lRygPWqaa	it really depends on the guy, it's hard for guys that joke around a lot to be serious, especially around the girl they like. they want to keep up their funny guy status but they also want to be serious sometimes. i think it would be a mean joke if he was kidding when he asked you to the dance so i would give him a chance :]|`|1af1c7a379dffa78d14850f6eb8af852aa	If you are serious then hold his hands and make him look you in the eyes and when he is talking watch his eyes and if he looks to the left or right he is not being truthful.  He must maintain eye contact or he is not being honest........|`|UnWKgmfZaa	Im a guy, and If I have to ask twice; Im usually not kidding.|`|tManvxfQaa	simple ,  ASK him......

13x9Tnpxaa	Tell him the truth. Just tell him the truth. If you don't tell him right away you both will push yourselves a little closer to each other and at that time it will be even harder to tell him. 1 week is nothing big. You two will soon get over this, i'm sure. You had time to know each other, it will be great if you can be friend. You two have been flirting? nah, anyone can make mistake sometimes.|`|THe5i67Iaa	the   best thing to do is tell him the truth.  I know  its like isn't there any way around it but believe me plz its the best way to do it.  its better off this way then you turning him if he invites you out and hurting him or making him feel bad.  plus your not just hurting him but yourself even more.   <br>  <br>  Hope you make the right choice.

But if your trying to hang out with a chick that isn't sure if she wants to or not, don't make sexual references while texting her. lol. Once you start getting real close you can do that. If you do make a sexual reference and she doesn't like it. Just say you were kidding. And you should ask her to come over tonight. But don't try anything until you know for sure she'll like it.|`|2S0qGc20aa	Yeah I dislike when the opposite sexes always like to mess with the mind, or so they are doing even if they don't know.<br>  But like I said they may not know.<br>  Text her saying "I was just wondering if you'd like to come over tonight and watch a movie. Of course if you're not busy don't want to be annoying, hah!" <br>  Or something to that statement.|`|aK57wZiGaa	Take your time, don't pester her. Otherwise you may seem too desperate. If you live that close and run into each other often then there is a good chance you will run into one another again sometime soon. When you see her next ask her out, texting can be annoying and calling her may seem to much. Leaving a cute note under her door in a few days time could also be an enticing idea.|`|LwkGOtBPaa	I think you should. Maybe she's scared and needs a bit of a push. Try doing something casual like going out to the mall something that doesn't involve staying in. She may just be scared and uneasy being alone with you. So make her a bit more comfortable by doing something that's a bit more comfortable and in her safety zone. It might also help telling her how much of a fun time you had during your last meeting.|`|xG7sujZyaa	dont make he feel like she has to hang out with you she will just think your weird and then you will have no chance just play it cool get to know who her friends are and have them start to like you and then you will be in ;)|`|Dbed3Buuaa	well don't ask her to come over again tonight because she is making too many excuses so u wouldn't hang out with her...she doesn't likes you if she did you will be hanging out with here right now don't be dumb and go find some one better then her there are plenty of fishes in the pond|`|vUuD9YExaa	I think that you should ask her to hang out. I think the only reason she stalls is because either she would just rather be friends with you or she likes you back and is just shy about it.|`|2hb0Lr2Raa	she text you once right? then don't contact her again. if she is interested she will contact you. best thing you can do if go find another girl to hang out with and relax.|`|BaxkqccSaa	yea ask her but dont try anything spend this time tring to see if she is intristed and then if you think she is ask her to hang out some more then you can try stuff spend tonight figureing things out!|`|jPQQkvr5aa	i think you should go for it. she seems like an OKAY girll.... dosent seem to mean.... i think you should try something the next time you hangout with her if you like her.|`|4d62502510861ac4f6499590d0d9f5d5aa	I would suggest to continue talking to her and make her WANT to hang out with you.

Don't act desperate, total turn off for girls. trust me.<br>  <br>  And also, wait an hour or two for her reply. If she doesn't reply, just text her later or the next day.<br>  <br>  (But calling is more impressive) =]|`|bYvGNvrvaa	I think you should, ask her if she wants to watch a movie again or play card games.|`|D8bTsWr8aa	Try to ask her again then if she doesn't respond move on...|`|8vfCRg7Caa	yeap, couldnt tell you how many wifes didnt like their husbands at first. Consistency helps and great timing.|`|e7Midrsoaa	ask her. yay<br>  go go go|`|PeZnLjkzaa	It sounds like the majority above me says to go for it and ask her. Say it as friends, cause she may take it like you want to be her boyfriend. If that is what you want to do, then just relax and give her time. You could drop some clues that you like her, and if she likes you back, she will do the same. Eventually, you two will ge going out in no time. Sorry if doesn't work out, but i really hope that it does.|`|LiZir5Jiaa	dont keep asking...a guy kept texting my friend to come over and she was sooo annoyed..a guy kept facebooking and im'ing me too and i was so fed up...give her some time...if she is interested, then soon she will wonder how U are doing and might text u to see whats up, then u might be able to make ur next move :-)|`|ShyCBmj5aa	I wouldn't ask her keep talkin to her and get to know her better<br>  <br>  asking over and over again will just annoy her.|`|9IanzxZ7aa	Trust me i know what she means I was in the same situation.

sr7jX2wYaa	Unless he can prove  he is not the  father  he can  not stop support  because  of an  article in the paper. He  has  shown  no respect for his  children  therefore none is  due him. You did right  by the man they consider their dad, by naming him  in the article. This  is  one of  those  rare  times where  mom doesn't know best.  Don't let it  worry you. The birth father still must support  his children, weather  he likes it or not*|`|XnmFz3Pqaa	No you shouldn't respect him and for that matter, if he does cut child support then who cares.  BUT...he can't do that unless he can prove he's not the father...or of course, stops working.  lol   <br>  <br>  You shouldn't respect him when he does nothing for the kids other than give you a few dollars.  Money doesn't replace a father...and in this case he was replaced by someone who wanted to take his place!<br>  <br>  I too am in sort of the same predicament...only, I don't respect my baby daddy and dont want anything to do with him!<br>  <br>  My daughter is 4 years old and the sperm donor...that's what I call him, has never laid eyes on her.  He said when she was 2 months old she wasn't his.  When I threatened court and dna testing for child support he told me he didn't care that he'd get around it.  Then I met my now husband when she was 3 months old....and when she was 6 months old the sperm donor started calling my work saying he wanted to see her.  I told him that was fine...to come see her but I wasn't bringing her to him and there was no ME AND HIM...he pushed me getting back with him for 4 days and when I finally told him to not call again until he wanted to see her and I'd meet him for a few...but didn't want any explanations or whatever he had to offer me because him and I were dead...he told me I was nothing but a ***** and that he I wanted it that way he didn't want to have nothing to do with either of us.  I have never pushed child support because my husband is her daddy!  PERIOD!  And her daddy pays for her!!!  Period!  I don't want a dime he has and never has.  My mom told me I was stupid when I first decided that...before I met my hubby...because I was 18, raising a baby, and working my *** off to live in my own home and not go back to my moms house with my little girl.  BUT...I refused because if he didn't want her, then he didn't deserve any rights to her and me recieving child support would have given that to him.  RIGHT NOW, he doesn't have a foot to stand on in a court when I go to take him and take his rights!  She's 4 years old and he's not contacted me since she was 6 months and he told me he didn't want anything to do with either of us.  <br>  <br>  If I were you and your husband really wants to be their daddy, I would take his rights, even if that meant dropping child support.  Hell, he may even sign them away if you agree to drop the child support.  YOUR KIDS are too good for him and his money!!!!!!!!!|`|edff8afcf9f8acedab9306f43761586baa	Ah Hell to the No.....Sounds like a sperm donor that helps you with child support. If he hasn't seen them in over a year you can strip him of his rights legally..just an FYI|`|AIrPtuDUaa	He cant cut child support. You have all the right to say your husband is their father you did nothing wrong.|`|VquZAwfHaa	That man is not a father, he was a sperm donor. Being a father involves a lot more then being there for the conception.|`|92RbBUQqaa	i dont think u should respect him at all!

The rulings handed down that I've heard lately make my head spin. I would be completely pessimistic about all of this, and not count on anything working in your favor. Just resign yourself to it. Don't try and speculate anything because it won't change the outcome, anyway, will it?  Be pessimistic, and then if something does go your way, it'll be a pleasant and happy surprise.<br>  <br>  Is there someone with a family law degree who might be able to research this a little for you and give you their best answer, where you live, on the phone?<br>  <br>  Best of luck !!|`|1fbf02e1452cd78e340d80c11af19502aa	Unless your husband is a monster, no judge wants to keep the fathers children away from their biological father so if there is evidence that is where she spent her money then that wont work in her favour. <br>  <br>  If however you suspect, she has transferred her money to her new partner and declared bankruptcy, I would contact a solicitor or a community legal centre or Legal Aid (free service) near you for some advice.<br>  <br>  I believe you also need to surrender the "what ifs" and trust that what happens will be for the good of all you concerned.

Sorry, but you cannot accommodate him on the night.|`|L6DZZ6SJaa	Just explain that because the venue is so small, you are forced to limit "guests" to spouses, or BF/GF that live together. <br>  <br>  Did she receive an invitation yet? The way my fiance and I worked around this was to write all the invited names on the invites (including the guests names). We didn't address anything "Ms. Jones + Guest". If the person is in a stable relationship for a while, they can have a guests, and can provide his/her name. If the person is not in a serious relationship with a name to provide, they are not getting a guest. There just is not room for singles to bring random people, so we are seating them with family.|`|WaTezVS0aa	Just explain to her that the site is smaller.

Explain that the venue is smaller, and you have to limit the guest list.  You might also explain to her mother/father as well, simply so that when she gets home and starts having a hissy fit (16 year olds do that), her parents can set her straight.  You can offer to take her and her boyfriend out after you're back from the honeymoon, that might soften the blow to her.  Just remember, she's 16.  She thinks of 1 person--herself.  Don't let it get to you--remember, you were like that too, and you turned out ok, right?  ;-)|`|4UUVrWXtaa	Just talk to her and explain to her what you are explaining to us, tell her that as much as you would like to invite him you are trying to make your wedding the smaller posible since you have already spend a lot of money..<br>  Explain to her that is hard for you, but you really want her at your wedding because she is important to you, but there is really no room for extra guests.|`|sLLgERQWaa	Tell her because of the tight budget you have to go by the 'ring rule'....no engagement ring or wedding ring, then you can't accommodate...there is no room for dates.

Closely associated is teenage actor, an actor who reached popularity as a teenager.<br>  <br>  In certain countries, a child actor may not:<br>  <br>     1. Risk his or her physical well-being (no dangerous stunts)<br>     2. Be exposed to morally compromising situations<br>     3. Be nude or partially nude<br>     4. Engage in overt sexual acts<br>     5. Be victims of any kind<br>  <br>  Compulsory education laws mandate that the education of child actor not be disrupted while the child is working. Whether a child actor is enrolled in public school, private school, or home school, the child does schoolwork under the supervision of a set teacher while on the set.<br>  <br>  Finally, the hours a child actor may work are limited. Generally, stricter time limits are imposed for younger actors. A very young infant might be allowed "under the lights" only a few minutes a day. It is common in television production for the role of a young child to be portrayed by identical twins or triplets to reduce each child's time on set. When a child turns 18, the legal limits on work time are lifted.<br>  Contents<br>  [hide]<br>  <br>      * 1 Regulation of child actors<br>      * 2 Issues involving child actors<br>            o 2.1 Ownership of earnings<br>            o 2.2 Competitive pressure<br>            o 2.3 Effects<br>      * 3 Listings of child actors and singers<br>      * 4 References<br>      * 5 External links<br>  <br>  [edit] Regulation of child actors<br>  <br>  The activities of child actors are regulated by the governing labor union, if any, and state and federal laws. Being a minor, a child actor must secure a work permit before accepting any paid performing work.<br>  <br>  Limitations imposed by laws are not uniform across the states or beyond national boundaries. Longer work hours or risky stunts, prohibited in California, for example, might be permitted to a project filming in British Columbia. Some projects film in remote locations specifically to evade regulations intended to protect the child.<br>  <br>  [edit] Issues involving child actors<br>  <br>  [edit] Ownership of earnings<br>  <br>  Using children in motion pictures has been criticized as exploitation, particularly since some prominent child actors never got to see the money they earned. Jackie Coogan became a millionaire while still a child but almost all of his money was used by his parents.<br>  <br>  Some have defended this saying that the child directly benefited from the lifestyle the earnings made possible or that the child would not have achieved stardom without a significant investment of time and effort by the parents. Others argue that it is unfair for the child to have to support the family when the parents are capable, as this tends to invert the parent child relationship.<br>  <br>  In 1939, California weighed in on this controversy by enacting the original Coogan Law, amended at various times since, which requires a portion of the earnings of a child actor to be preserved in a special savings account called a blocked trust.<br>  <br>  [edit] Competitive pressure<br>  <br>  Some people also criticize the parents of child actors for allowing their children to work, believing that more “normal” activities should be the staple during the childhood years. Others observe that competition is present in all areas of a child’s life—from sports to student newspaper to orchestra and band—and believe that the work ethic instilled, or the talent developed accrues to the child’s benefit.<br>  <br>  The child actor may experience unique and negative pressures when working under tight production schedules. Large projects which depend for their success on the ability of the child to deliver an effective performance add to the pressure.<br>  <br>  However, some studios have taken measures to protect child actors from exposure to inappropriate behavior. For example, The Guardian reported that<br>  <br>      "Child stars will be protected from nudity, swearing, smoking and drinking under a groundbreaking new policy that places the welfare, safety and education of performing children at the forefront of Disney's productions".[citation needed]<br>  <br>  [edit] Effects<br>  <br>  Many actors' careers are short-lived, and this is also true of child actors. However others have had successful careers into adulthood. Many transition with little difficulty to non-acting careers.

Most notably, Shirley Temple became a successful public figure and diplomat, eventually becoming U.S. Ambassador to Ghana, then United S|`|xj5lIwaHaa	Minus the bad grammar and typing.<br>  <br>  It is up to you friends come and go, but so do boyfriends.

Tell him that u don't what a bad relationship with him and that it really hurts.... what if he too had a father like that?? what if his father was mean to him too?? does he work alot? maybe its just stress from work coming home... probably because of the down fall of the economy right now.... he needs a life too, maybe he should take a day off and JUST SPEND IT WITH U!!!<br>  try that!<br>  hope it works!<br>  Good Luck!|`|7511595fc4d3e31538e8df239de8a7c5aa	stubborn and stupid,,, ya, that about sums it up.|`|84mMAYjxaa	Show him exactly what you said. Don't tell him directly, that will be awkward. Instead, write a letter about how you want to be closer, and send it to him. A little later, maybe you'll get a hug.<br>  <br>  Good luck!
mCM363I9aa	If you really want to save your marriage I'm sure the first two things will be a good start.<br>  <br>  Stop the insults or sarcasm and start saying "good morning" or "how was your day?"<br>  <br>  Surprise her with lunch or bring her a rose.<br>  <br>  There is so much you can do to stop your marriage from falling apart but only you know your wife well enough.|`|RN1wGlWWaa	We went to see it about 2 weeks after it was out.  We have a very strong and loving marriage and it was a great movie.  We are thinking of getting the book in case someone else needs to use it.<br>  <br>  I would get the Love Dare book and read it and do it - then see what happens.  I pray that you can save your marriage and she will come back.|`|m8UEGUaGaa	Not sure why you separated but, do not try this if your spouse has cheated and has not ended affair!<br>  <br>  Your wife has to want to save the marriage just as much as you do. <br>  <br>  Love dare or fireproof  does no work if marriage has burnt to ashes.|`|KRE5oflKaa	The movie was amazing. My husband and I both cried.  I started conversations between us that would not have been started.  We are about to do the love dare.  I have heard many people tell me that it saved their married.  One example was from infidelity.  He wanted it saved, she didnt.... after watching Fireproof and doing the love dare, they are back together working on the marriage.  Another example was she wanted it saved, he didnt...same thing...they are now working on their marriage and doing great.  The book and movie can be purchased at any local christian book store.  There is more material to it too...  "Fireproofing your marriage" is good too.<br>  <br>  Good luck and God bless.  I will pray that your marriage will work.  ITs hard, but doable.|`|qut1Mze4aa	I just saw the movie Fireproof on Monday and I thought is was an amazing movie, very impactful!  As for the Love Dare, when I find the book I will purchase it and try to follow it.<br>  <br>  As the other answerer said, this is a very good start to repairing your marriage depending on what the problems are.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|ydclPOBLaa	yes my husband and i watched it together after being separated for 3 months and even being a tough cry he cried and loved it.. it really helped us understand each other more.. invite your wife to watch it with you its great.. good luck|`|Qm1P0VSNaa	You to look for her and ask her to forgive you,and start again;don't forget love is a very powerful arm<br>  <br>  MY LEADER MILDRED SENT ME HERE****
a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	she obviously doesn't want a divorce, so u still have a chance to make things right. so ask her why she is so distant.u save it by going back in there and fighting for it, not running away and asking for a divorce when things don't go your way.|`|AnW3dzQfaa	Read the "Proper care and feeding of Marriages" or sign up for marriage counseling.  You can make it work and usually once you make it work after a really rough time the marriage is awesome.|`|jEC8Ctp5aa	You need to give us way more information than that. What broke you up? Money problems? Infidelity? <br>  <br>  The fact that neither of you really wants this should count for something, seeing as how she won't sign the papers and you just said that you don't know what to do to save your marriage.<br>  <br>  What happened? And give as many details as you can so that we can have a better idea of how to be helpful.<br>  <br>  :D|`|AA11348136	It is very obvious that you want it to work and it seems that she does also since she will not sign the papers. Since you are leaving out so many details, you will have to determine what is getting you frustrated and get some counseling. A lot of people get it and it helps.|`|AA11996507	Talk to her, tell her that you'd like to give the relationship another chance, and suggest couples counselling.  If she agrees, that is a good sign.|`|mCM363I9aa	let her know you did it because of frustration but you really want to work it out.|`|2772e87aa33409feddb59d5fab2d13f9aa	I think so many marriages break up because people are just so darn stubborn.  It reminds me of a story my grandma told me about her ex husband.  He was the love of her life but because they were both so stubborn and wouldn't tell the other how they felt and that they didn't want the divorce they  lost each other forever.  My advice is...tell her you still love her.  Tell her you will go to marriage counseling, anything to keep her in your life.  If you still break up at least you will know you tried and I'm sure that will be something you can live with.  Can you reaaly live with the not knowing or the what if's.  I know I couldn't.|`|XmX3irUhaa	She probably has things to say to you that she cannot say! It sounds like she doesn't wanna let go of you, I doubt she is doing it just to be awkward, I think anyone who wants to upset someone would sign the papers incase you were just doing it as a threat. Talk to her the best you can and try to be as calm as possible, maybe flowers or something and just ask her if its ok if you sit down and have a chat?|`|3RHSSEDnaa	Communicate.  Are you still on talking terms otherwise?  Does she understand why you are frustrated? How do you expect her to feel with the threat of divorce papers in her face and you saying you want to get back together?  I'm confused - so I can understand her.<br>  <br>  Firstly - we see and feel in others the traits and habits that we dislike in ourselves.  The best marriages I have ever seen is where the couple are confident with whom they are individually and appreciative for the partner in their lives that they can share with.<br>  <br>  Take a look at yourself and the past few years.  Why did you marry, when did it go sour, when did you stop liking yourself, and why should  you get back together?<br>  <br>  Read "The Teachings of Abraham" or watch the DVDs - listen to the CDs.  Learn, accept and grow.|`|0H4VWcH0aa	Well honey that is what just happened to me and guess what i still took him to court and got my divorce done and over with. Now he's the one that fills like and a**. Oh another thing (hint) it's alot quicker if you get the papers to do your own divorce that way you don't have to pay alot of money or court fees.|`|q3FDAQ9Baa	Your confused on rather you want ti to work too  or if your really wanting her to sign or not.<br>  Talk with her and tell her marriage counseling is in order.  It's a must.<br>  <br>  If you already filed  and she doesn't sign, it doesn't mean it will happen. She has a time period on which it has to be fought.|`|1k6UUC8qaa	talk to her... tell her how you feel i'm sure she will listen if she loves you.  You both have to give.  Throw your pride out the window forget the past start over again put bad feelings aside be sincere.  If that doesn't work at least you went the extra mile.  Tell her what you wrote and admit why you served the papers good luck|`|qtOTa4iAaa	What caused the separation? Are you guys grown?  Why aren't you talking to each other.|`|AH4d8v4uaa	don't force anything at this point. life is very treacherous
zKLl9iSHaa	lmao here are a few funny ones that i liked<br>  1. I wouldn’t say you’re fat but when you sit around the house, you sit around the house! <br>  <br>  2. You’re so fat when you went to school you sat next to everybody. <br>  <br>  3. I wouldn’t say you’re fat but you have more chins than a Hong Kong telephone directory. <br>  <br>  4. If hot air makes a balloon go up what’s keeping you down? <br>  <br>  5. What times lunch, and is there any left after you eat? <br>  <br>  6. You could be in the movies- you could play crowd scenes all by yourself. <br>  <br>  7. Is it alright if I sell you’re underwear to the circus? I hear they need a new tent. <br>  <br>  8. I wouldn’t say you’re fat but you have more pounds than the Bank of England, and I ain’t talking about your wallet. <br>  <br>  9. I wouldn’t jump up and down, you could cause an earthquake. <br>  <br>  10. I hear the local restaurant are serving all flavours of Slimfast. <br>  <br>  11. If you went on a diet two undeveloped nations would have enough food to eat for a year. <br>  <br>  12. Is that your stomach or did you swallow a beach ball?|`|dVFsejjJaa	HAHHAHAA. that's pretty funny.<br>  you could say:<br>  <br>  -At least I'm not the reason why the earth is tilted.<br>  -If he's in any of you classes, you could say "Hey! Glad you made it up the stairs in time!" (When the teacher doesn't hear you)<br>  -Make gagging affects when he wears shorts.<br>  -Tell him that you promise to complain about the door openings, and you will suggest carving a larger entry.<br>  <br>  you might want a few other disses, because you need more than just fat jokes. you want people to think that you're better than them so they dont even bother to mess with you. <br>  <br>  A few other disses:<br>  -Life is screwed up. Like your face.<br>  -Stick a post it on his back that says "I have no balls." where he can't reach it.<br>  -Call him a fag but you need a reason even if its a bad one, ex:<br>  <br>  "HAH. Fag, you wear skinny jeans."<br>  even though i think skinny jeans are hot ;D<br>  <br>  Sorry, don't really know any guy disses because i diss mainly girls.|`|i7EMqQq5aa	Dissing people isn't even nice or fun, you should just ignore him and pretend you never heard anything.|`|aclhGwh3aa	that's rude, I should know I'm overweight, just ignore him, he's nothing but a bully.|`|M2EKtjIbaa	"When you stepped on the scale you saw two phone numbers!"<br>  <br>  Yell out, "Hey, there's that guy that was on the show about the two ton man! Can I have your autograph?!"
iizKx4Bvaa	learn to accept you first. Tell yourself how hot you are every day and soon hubby will see it feel it and live it. It is all how you secure you feel. work what you working with and put the one two on him darling. work it feel it and enjoy it.lol. I know you have a good imagination use it to your advantage. try some tantric techniques which can bring you and hubby closer some couples yoga is amazing too. It is not all about penetration but rather about the connection.

Then just take the lead and do what you want and he will folow.<br>  <br>  rd|`|SS5py9jIaa	A woman who feels sexy IS sexy.

If you feel comfortable with yourself, and feel sexy, it will show and chances are he'll be ready to ravage you on the spot. <br>  <br>  You can always mix things up a little with some fantasy role playing, new toys, massage oils, or even just playing around in a different part of your house then usual. Little details can make a big difference.|`|9x0pLKnvaa	Girl I had the same problem! <br>  But buy some night-gowns that are a little tight<br>  and fitting to your body!

sbfJ3ma6aa	It took me about 6 months or so but people fall at a different rate all the time. You should give it about another week or two and give him a little more time to see if he will tell you first but if still he dosent and you feel complelty ready then tell him on like the 6th month day or something so that you can say yall have been together for half a year and just yeah|`|AA11795191	It took me a year before I knew I was one hundred percent in love with my boy. And it took 3 months after that before we told each other. :-)|`|oCxBeEI6aa	I know what you mean girl. Take some advice.

FZKFLTyLaa	Typically, the bride/groom first dance is something soft and romantic, not a display of dancing skills per se. <br>  If he really wants to do this I'd place it somewhere later in the agenda and have audience participation.<br>  And no, beginning a reception all heated and sweaty seems rather unrealistic and tiring. <br>  Your day will be exhausting enough already.|`|kUE3Ddktaa	The evolution of dance thing is REALLY overdone. Check youtube - there are hundreds of videos of couples doing this.<br>  <br>  What would be awesome is if you started off with a slow song and then segued into a really upbeat swing or salsa number. Take a couple dance lessons and you'll look fabulous!|`|2eoAqicdaa	I was hoping to do the same until I seen the videos on youtube...<br>  Its been done too many times now and would be expected.<br>  How about when you make your entrance before your first dance like you would walk (dance in) to beyoncé or something and he would come in dancing to M.J, or you both can make another unique entrance... people are getting bored of it now :(|`|4lL34wJnaa	Honestly, it's been done and is not so unexpected any more!  <br>  <br>  My fiance and I have chosen a non-traditional first dance, but we don't want to kill ourselves.  We chose a short (about 1 minute 30 seconds), upbeat, oldie, that has probably never been used as a first dance song before.  It's fun and really expresses our love.  We're going to dance to "Sunshine Lollipops and Rainbows" by Lesley Gore.|`|1k6UUC8qaa	I would go with something slow and romantic that means something to you both  its your wedding not a regular party maybe you can do that not for your first dance but later on and whoever wants to join can do it for as long as they last.  pick up clips from u tube some of those things look like a joke.  Your wedding is not a joke or you want to remember it as one|`|RuKK1LYiaa	thats really overdone, you could always do some dance number from a movie or something like the dance scene from dirty dancing at the end, or you could do thriller, or even one of the dances from rocky horror picture show
qiATez8Xaa	Kick them in the balls (trust me in works)|`|1OxiOk2taa	if someone asks you if these are true- say no.<br>  <br>  also go up to these 2 boys and ask them not to continue.|`|rkFVxFb4aa	The only thing u could do to stop a rumour is kill..its pretty much impossible|`|Ze8SBpSCaa	just keep denying it if it isn't true. Those boys are prolly immature and don't have anything else more important to do. <br>  If the rumor is still spreading, just ignore it, your true friends know the truth and will believe you.|`|GobivjWGaa	act like you know nothing about the rumor or tell them its a lie they made. or make one up about them|`|csBHHhfSaa	make up ones about them. ik not the best advice but i garintee u it will work!!!! just make up bad onces|`|Iwn5oAvkaa	It is so hard to stop a rumor and I know they can be hurtful when not true! I would do one of two things - 1. approach the two boys starting the rumor and ask them how they know these supposed things and how it is any of there business. Don't be mean, be firm and make them look dumb for starting rumors and YOU will look like their non-sense doesn't bother you and the bigger person...don't start a rumor yourself; it makes you look bad and like their rumors are true. 2. Be patient, in about a week those dumb boys will have something else to talk or spread rumors about. Option 2 stinks because your waiting it out but, again your taking the higher road. Keep a smile on your face and act like it does not bother you.|`|BUKLPCfWaa	Honestly, I don't think there's any way to stop a rumor.  Treat it like you think it's stupid and when people ask let them know that whoever believes it is stupid and being tricked, and pretend you're so far above it it it doesn't even bother you.  If you let people know how much it bothers you they might think it's true and you just don't want people to know.|`|i7EMqQq5aa	Never make up ones just to fight back. Is the rumour bad? Well hopefully the rumour wasn't that bad and you weren't too hurt. I tried having a rumour going on about me, everyone asked if it was true, I denied it like you did. All you have to do is stand up for yourself and don't let anyone take you down.
RjExx29Oaa	wow he seems to really care and doesn't want t see you in pain aww that's sweet omg he doesn't like you right? but maybe you go to marriage counseling and tell him that and he will want to talk to you again|`|bqllCJsTaa	Its not that he dosent want to be your friend its that he just wants to see you happy. You can't build a forever relationship with someone you don't trust evenif that someone is you husband. Every time he goes out you're not happy because you are wondering what he's doing and who he with. Your friend thinks you are a great person the type of woman that every man wants  and it seems that he wants to give you something to think about down the line. Just because you are married dosen't mean that you have to abide by his rules all the time. Why don't you go around alone one night and see how he acts. Or better yet if you don't want to go out just do what i did to my boyfriend once. I put on a killer outfit complete with heels and let my hair down and I just went riding for about 3 hours and when I got back he realized that he didn't want to loose me and realized how wonderful I was and all kinds of thing that he didn't think about before. Make him feel how you feel when he goes out. Always remember that communication and trust and honesty is the key to a healthy relationship.|`|XnmFz3Pqaa	I think this guy is just tired of sitting there and being your shoulder to lean on when something goes wrong at home!  He KNOWS that you deserve better and it pisses him off that you are just sitting there and letting these things happen.  Most of the time women don't realize how it looks to other people or exactly what is going on because they are living it and there is a big thing in the world called DENIAL! <br>  <br>  In a nut shell, I think you are in denial....you are in love and don't know how to get out of it.  But, you are in a bad situation.  Hunny, once you get married to going out to bars all the time is over.  People who want to make a marriage work get that out of their systems before they get married!  You caught him doing something wrong and yet he is still putting himself in those positions to do wrong things!  You don't know if anything has happened since or not....and you know you can't take your word for it because he's done it once already!  Either way he should be at home enjoying his time with his WIFE....not at a bar...and if he is at a bar he should be there with you, once again, enjoying time with you.  Im not saying don't let him go out and have a bear once in a while with the guys....Im saying don't let him do it every weekend and leave you sitting there wondering what he's doing!<br>  <br>  I think your friend has your best interest at heart and doesn't know what to do to get you to see what you truly deserve!!!
brFVpD1Qaa	lol shes beautiful, i know your plan u just wana get stars but i gav u 1 anyway :P yeah shes beautiful and really nice, wbu?|`|egYNGvidaa	yes, i have one on my boyfriend of 2 yrs!! :) <3<br>  he's amazing!!|`|RHIJ6OPQaa	yeah definitly.. he is:<br>  1.hot<br>  2.funny<br>  3.nice<br>  4.sweet<br>  5.caring<br>  6.cute <br>  ..and many more.. :)<br>  his name is Joshua. *sighs* hes soo amazing.|`|YJei6ySfaa	yea definitely i have a crush on this guy who is 3yrs older than me im 12 and he's 15 but he's really hot and supper nice to and he's funny and hot and strong and hot and supper nice and he has a 6 pack and he's HOT!!!!!!|`|8PkEkTcZaa	yes i have a crush on a guy but i don't know his name i see him allot in and out of a couple of stores all i throw at him is a smile|`|kn6Lrf6Raa	ermm, he's pretty ugly, I don't know why I like him =/<br>  i guess he just intrigues me. =]<br>  lol xD<br>  except the face, he is very sexy (well I think so)
GWiGH5D6aa	well im the same way with guys, i tend to like more then one guy its normal for any girl.<br>  <br>  as for your friend. if she isnt going to be there and if she thinks that she shouldnt hang out with you then you dont need her. find different friends.|`|Nin6IawVaa	One thing you need to do is keep your mouth shut. There is nothing wrong with liking more than one guy. You are young and you will have many crushes. The difference between you and your friends are...you have a big mouth and anncounce it to the world. They are quiet about their feelings, but I bet they like more than one boy.<br>  <br>  This is a lesson learned. Only give little information. More you share information with your friends, more trouble you get in|`|wvloojLaaa	just tell her how your feeling and not to do that cuz its not nice for a friend to do that
678oGIupaa	im really sorry to hear,<br>  <br>  i trsut my boyfriend with everything<br>  <br>  if you trust yours and no he will be there for you yes tell him it helps massively.<br>  <br>  when my nan died of cancer my boyfirend of the time was great im glad i opened up to him he was there for me and new how to cheer me up.<br>  <br>  i guess it can emotionally connect you as we have been friends ever since even though we split up there was not one day where we hated eahc other.<br>  <br>  though it can depend on the both of you i guess<br>  <br>  i hope everything works out well|`|GBr9YngTaa	You told strangers on the internet, but you couldn't tell your boyfriend?<br>  <br>  If you trust him, you should tell him. This trust will bring you closer together as I am sure if there's something that is going on in his life you would want him to tell you. If he doesn't understand and is scared away from this, he's honestly not worth it. This trust will bring you an emotional connection.|`|MFMFIqhpaa	It probably will.  If he's a good bf, it will.  He should listen and you should feel like you can tell him pretty much anything.  Good luck|`|BEqAhXBlaa	oh for feck sake ask him how on earth do you expect anyone else to know what is right for you in a situation like this?|`|oexR7Gbbaa	If you and your boyfriend are as close as you say you are you shouldn't even have to think about telling him about things going on in your life.|`|RoTLnFGZaa	Yes. You should. It'll make your boyfriend feel closer to you & that you trust him,which can only do good for your relationship . And in the process you'll be able to get a lot off your chest.<br>  <br>  I wish you the best.<br>  <br>  You need to tell your step-dad to stop being a coward. Nothing has happened yet, so he should be with your mama. right now, he's leaving by CHOICE and that's going to hurt her a lot worse than if it was by Fate the way things had to be...Running won't help.<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  don't commit suicide, hun. That's a selfish thing to do. Think about the people who love you and how bad this would hurt them. Think about your mama who really needs you right now. You should be comforting her and you know she couldn't take losing both you and her husband.|`|Z4B93N31aa	you should talk to him about everything<br>  that what connects you emotionally
ZVDboZkPaa	Firstly you inform the service provider as to what is being sent to you; provide them with the full headers.<br>  <br>  In chat you can download the page and you have a copy of that.<br>  <br>  Print it all off and take a copy to your local police.<br>  <br>  Where your partner is concerned, he does not sound too adult and appears to be behaving like a 15 year old, but then boys do tend to lag behind girls when it comes to growing up.<br>  <br>  I would give him a choice, does he love you enough to stay and be an adult or does he just want to be a big kid and hang out with his family.<br>  <br>  If it is that he prefers his family then give him the boot.<br>  <br>  A question that rises to my cynical mind is, is he freeloading off you?|`|WQVLzTbMaa	You're not over reacting, your partner is under reacting.  But you never said if you apologized for offending them. Maybe that would put an end to it. Even if you feel you are right.|`|8WGxXA5vaa	That is appalling. Your partner is pathetic for not sticking by you, but are you sure you didn't say anything to them to insult them cos it's kinda hard to understand why someone would say such things out of the blue. Maybe next time keep your opinions to your self about his family, I agree with you that 16/17 is way to young to have a baby but to be honest it didn't concern you. Anyway I think you should not respond to their emails or comments at all ignore them and eventually they will get sick of typing things without getting a response. <br>  <br>  Block your address from them and don't visit them and allow them to visit you, If they do come down call the cops and have them removed from your premises. <br>  <br>  Your partner is an A -hole what kind of a man stands around and allows his family to insult you like that. I don't know I don't want to tell you what to do but my opinion is to leave him and move to your moms house until he begs you to come back but I would only come back if there was evidence of him telling his family to stop their insults. <br>  <br>  Stand strong and don't show your weakness and show them your afraid of them cos they will continue to bully you.<br>  <br>  Good luck and if it really gets out of hand hand the emails to police.|`|Kk9f3MdRaa	if someone sends you threatening messages saying they want to kill you...you are definitely NOT overreacting. In fact, I would try and save them and print them off (if you can) so you can take them to the police. This is serious stuff if they are saying they will kill you. Your partner doesn't sound like much a knight in shining armor if he isn't willing to stick up for you and defend you.|`|YSom6ZeMaa	Download the latest version of windows live messenger<br>  <br>  <a href="http://download.live.com/?sku=messenger" rel="nofollow">http://download.live.com/?sku=messenger</a><br>  <br>  you can report them to the WLM team,they may suspend/delete their email accounts or even take further action. Also,show the chat logs to the police. I have been in similar circumstances before,involving death threats,stalking etc.<br>  <br>  Just report it to the police,they can threaten the perpetrator's with an arrest,and if they do carry on,they can be arrested and charged,do it for yourself,and no,you are not over reacting,take action,you'll feel much better for it,trust me x|`|cb6ToDZYaa	You are not over reacting.  Your partners family are being very abusive to you, and I am having a really hard time with the fact that your partner has not put a stop to this.  He should be standing by you and protecting you.  Do everything you can to distance yourself from these people and have no more contact.  They will eventually get bored and find someone else to bully.  As for your partner - you need to be with someone who makes you feel safe and puts you and your children number one in his life.  I know these people are his family, but you and your children are too, and his responsibility is to you and the kids.  You need to talk to him about this.  If he continues to laugh at your concerns, you need to consider why you are in this relationship to begin with.  Good luck.|`|94T42ttpaa	no your not!|`|ebmwiAI8aa	i don't think your overreacting, but if they were threatening to kill me, i would take it to the cops whether they ment it or not. but im only 13. what do I know?|`|npaxgwMlaa	It is actually illegal to send messages like that to someone over the internet. Save the messages in a file and send them to the police - report them for it. That is punishable by jail time. It is NOT ok to tell someone they should kill themselves.
24bdcdc34da2c3f37a8684801cf27971aa	hahah you're cute :) well i'd say at least two months, just incase she says no. and then she also has more than enough time to get ready :):):) that's the night of her dreams before graduating!!|`|DhcQC9DBaa	i would say a lil more than a month because the girl is going to want to match so you have to get a tux of the same color as her dress and her dress she has to pick out so she needs time and you need to git a tux....<br>  <br>  <br>  prom is a waste of time and money my friend. run away while you can.|`|SjEH1Lx6aa	At least a couple of months in advance. You can ask later, but the earlier the better so you make sure they don't already have a date.|`|INoFAZvAaa	1st or 2nd grade, no but seriously ask as early as possible|`|rFlhIgJXaa	I would say ask her at least a month in advance so she has good um... timing, and so you can coordinate outfits (example she wears green dress you wear green tie, pretty sure your mother or date will help you out with that) But of course the earlier the better|`|HinSwo97aa	it depends who you're asking.<br>  if it's someone desirable, i'd act quickly.<br>  plus, if for whatever reason they want a new date, you have time to change dates too.<br>  if it's too late, you might not get to plan or know each other enough.<br>  from personal expirience, planning earlier is better.|`|nqYHVVl7aa	as soon as possible<br>  <br>  so you can  <br>  1) buy tickets when they are on sale<br>  2) know what your date is gonna wear so you can match<br>  3) get a date before everyone is taken<br>  4) get all the other crap like flowers that you need to get your date|`|YjaVT2JHaa	well judging by the time of year, and im guessing this is a spring prom, you should ask NOW. right now. call the guy/girl up and ask!|`|UGSlEhnbaa	Ask the moment you know who you want to go with!

This is coming from a fourteen year old, by the way!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  1. Strike up a small conversation. This will help you learn little things that will come in handy in the future. All girls are different, so be aware of the signs. Listen to the tone of her voice: if she's shy, the tone of her voice might be a little higher and she might start to play with her hair (smoothing it down, twirling, flipping) or adjusting her clothes. Another sign she likes you is if she laughs at a normally boring or stupid joke. (Though, don't be dumb and use bad jokes as a test or you'll just look like a comedic loser.) She may not be able to look you straight in the eye and she might giggle a lot.<br>  <br>  2. Watch for signs of flirting. If she's flirting, she may be difficult to read. Flirtatious girls may flirt with guys who they consider to be just friends, and it can be misconstrued as a crush. Because most girls do not want to be obvious, the flirtatious ones might flirt with you a little bit less or they might flirt with you even more. Either way, don't "flirt around". Do not flirt with other girls. If she ever sees you putting your arm around another girl or sees another girl hug you, she may jump to conclusions and assume she doesn't mean anything to you. <br>  <br>  3. Notice if she touches you more often than what friends do (she's constantly trying to touch your hand or something). If she finds excuses to do so, then you're probably on the right track. But conversely, don't assume that just because she isn't touching you that she doesn't like you. She may be too nervous of you to touch you yet. Break the touch barrier yourself. <br>  <br>  4. Observe how she looks at you. If she like you, she will either hold it for a long time or pull away immediately. Either of these could mean that she likes you. If she pulls away quickly, it means she is nervous but she still likes you - which means that you should probably make the first move. If she holds the stare, then she is confident and she may make the first move. If you happen to glance at the girl and you see her staring back at you, then this means that she likes you, although she may quickly dart her head in a different direction. Look for her eyes to light up when she sees you or hears your name. <br>  <br>  5. Look at her friends. If you see most of her friends glancing back at you and smiling or giggling, this means that she is telling her friends about you. If her friends are loud and immature, you'll hear "(your name), (her name) likes you!" Her friends might be making it up, however, just to tease her. When she is having a conversation with her friends, and you come over, she might stop talking all of a sudden. This likely means you were the subject of the recently ended conversation. If she likes you and she told her friends about you, they might come up to you and start a random conversation about things such as: Who would you rather date?, Who do you like better?, Who is the hottest?, and such. If they name a list of about 3 people and her name is in the list, she probably told her friends about you and they're trying to search for clues to see how you feel about her. <br>  <br>  6. Look out for the damsel in distress. If you're outside and the girl you like is nearby and starts loudly saying "I'm cold!", that's a subtle hint that she wants you to give her your sweatshirt. This is a very sweet gesture, especially if you want to show the girl that you like her. If there are other guys and she likes one of those guys, however, she might act disappointed when you offer yours to her first, in which case at least you'll know how she feels and can move on. Sometimes a girl will pretend to be really bad at something, and say that they can't do it. That is your cue to offer some assistance, and she will most likely be doing this on purpose just to see your reaction. <br>  <br>  7. Smile at her. Do a natural smile - don't freak her out. If she smiles politely, or frowns and looks away, say goodbye to her. She is obviously freaked out by you. If she returns a soft or big smile and continues to look at you, then she is interested. If she smiles then darts over to the crowd of her friends and hides in the group then she may be nervous and curious if you know that she likes you. <br>  <br>  8. Her Hair If she tugs on her hair or plays with it,when she is around your or when she sees you come into a room, it means she's nervous. She's nervous about seeing you. <br>  <br>  9. Staring Depending on how much she likes you and how good of an actress she is, she can give you long looks when your not looking or glance at you.|`|06de8f8bd2139814a2ba53ab67d9d65daa	laughing ( like slight over laughing) and reaching out and touching your arm.. touching in general ( mean like brushing her arm against yours one too many times, stuff like that)<br>  tucking her hair behind her ear, playing wiyth her hair in general.<br>  touching her self can be a clear one ( like i.e stroking her arm, putting her hands on her face) <br>  if she seems slightly awkward and laughs a little ott then thats a clear sign ( though not body language.) <br>  <br>  i'll get back to you if i can think of more (:<br>  x|`|LwkGOtBPaa	The biggest sign a girl likes you is she always tries to be around you and/or is always looking at you.

That's what I did, I kept bringing up feelings for old boyfriends, people I liked, etc and it worked for me but sometimes space is a good option. If you can establish what Tim really likes, what his passion is, and maybe engage him in a conversation about that?

A sensitive boy, I luv that! LOL sorry... I'm a girl and in high school and I have certainly dealt w/ bullying before. The only solution that ever worked for me was completely, 100% ignoring the bully. I completely shut out the person who was bugging me and when they weren't getting the reaction they were looking for, they stopped. So thats my recommendation, and I know it can be hard when someone gets in ur face and constantly shouts hurtful insults in front of everyone, but it has worked for me so it might for you. Dont even look at him, just shut him out.|`|Kk9f3MdRaa	Tell him to F*ck off. If you stick up for yourself, chances are he will get scared and back off. Bully's don't like kids with confidence.

I think that this thing with you and your friends being mean is just a faze. All girls get catty and rude sometimes. But you just try extra hard to start being nicer and maybe your clique will follow your example. But even if they don't, soon I think things will get better. Every one has the time in they teen years that someone will push them until they turn mean. Just try to ignore the girl and try to set an example and when you start to say something mean, just think about that you are only making yourself more mean and making yourself look worse. And if you have to say something and get something mean out, don't say it out loud, maybe you could just think it. But try to set an example. Hope I was help. Good Luck!
4hGiHtNhaa	I think you were right for politely saying no to taking there trash. And i totally understand why you would lend her money- so you wouldn't be rude. But since she hasn't paid you back and spent all the money instead of giving you the change, she took advantage of you. I know you don't want to be rude to her, but you have to take a stand or you will always have people taking advantage of you. It may start just being five dollars, but if you dont take care of it now, it will be bigger, worse stuff they will try to get from you. I think you should go up to this girl and nicely tell her you need your monay back. If she doesnt give it back, dont back down, you may have to get rude with her, but you can't let her take advantage of you. And if she keeps asking for you to do more or give her more, they you will just need to straight up tell her no and why. I know you dont want to be mean, but you surely wouldn't want to be taken advantage of. Atleast thats what I think you should do. I hope I was hepl. Good Luck!|`|495cae0b37c858b3963bfd36608182d9aa	You don't want to live a life where you are regretting every single action you do. If you don't stand up for yourself soon, you never will.

XnmFz3Pqaa	I think everyone gets annoyed by people who are backstabbing and hide their true personality...but that's just life.  As far as friends liking a guy that you like...if your friend knew about it then they aren't a friend to begin with!  As far as true love...it will come to you, you don't have to search for it. <br>  <br>  Im gonna share alittle something with you that I share with my friends...I have a lot of beliefs and unlike many my beliefs are not based on anyone elses opinions BUT mine...and those beliefs have come from experience! Some of those beliefs are that many girls settle for less because rather they want to be MISS I.N.D.E.P.E.N.D.E.N.T they are not. It doesn't always mean that we CAN'T take care of ourselves, it just means that we long for that companionship! I have also learned that love IS WORK, but it is not a full time job! If you spend more time at trying to make things work that you do actually enjoying it, its not meant to be. If you are broken up as much as you are together, its not meant to be! Love IS LOVE, from beginning till end. It may take one time to let that person go, but once you've felt your life without the other, IF its true, you could never imagine another day like that! If you've had a bad past with someone-even though it may be the PAST, it doesn't mean you CAN get over it! Friends defenatly aren't always going to be there, nor will the guys you THINK you have fallen in love with. Don't put all your trust into anyone because you are going to get hurt regardless.  Guys AREN'T what YOU THINK when you are young and neither is the love you share with them-You will probably not always be with your first love and they WILL be replaced by your TRUE first love when you ACTUALLY EXPERIENCE real love-There IS only ONE man/woman in this world for you and you DO not need to search for him. <br>  * I simply, truly believe, as humans, we ALL make MISTAKES! As grown ups we eventually learn that we don't REGRET those mistakes, that we learn from them!<br>  <br>  As far as living with these questions...we all do at some point in time...but you will eventually, unintentionally, find your way!  Life is not full of fun, and is very hard...but once you find the right path, although it will always have bumps in the road...it will be worth it!|`|0qspJSt9aa	well you can ask this advice at jamrie<br>  its more of a personal advice website.<br>  people over there might be able to help you out.<br>  <br>  i go there all the time!|`|RjExx29Oaa	these are questions we all think about time to time i know life is complicated and sometimes there seems to be no answers|`|7gDeqlfnaa	I am lost no matter what! how do I feel everyday with people?

Gosh, it's so annoying when people just bother you, look at you when your eating, on the train, on the bus, whatever. Stop looking at me A**hole!!! I am not fat, but one thing is I used to be.

Speak your truth quietly and clearly; and listen to others, even to the dull and the ignorant; they too have their story. Avoid loud and aggressive persons; they are vexatious to the spirit. <br>  <br>  If you compare yourself with others, you may become vain or bitter, for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself. Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans. Keep interested in your own career, however humble; it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time. <br>  <br>  Exercise caution in your business affairs, for the world is full of trickery. But let this not blind you to what virtue there is; many persons strive for high ideals, and everywhere life is full of heroism. Be yourself. Especially do not feign affection. Neither be cynical about love, for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment, it is as perennial as the grass. <br>  <br>  Take kindly the counsel of the years, gracefully surrendering the things of youth. Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune. But do not distress yourself with dark imaginings. Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness. <br>  <br>  Beyond a wholesome discipline, be gentle with yourself. You are a child of the universe no less than the trees and the stars; you have a right to be here. And whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should. <br>  <br>  Therefore be at peace with God, whatever you conceive Him to be. And whatever your labors and aspirations, in the noisy confusion of life, keep peace in your soul. <br>  <br>  With all its sham, drudgery, and broken dreams, it is still a beautiful world. Be cheerful. Strive to be happy.
mhvoPAOCaa	I would say he definitely likes you
UGSlEhnbaa	With my experience, I find that boys like a sense of humor. I have gone through about 4 boyfriends in the last 6 months, and I have found that all you need to do to crack a smile or a laugh is to make a joke or tell a funny story. Just be sure not to make him the butt of the joke or say something he will not understand. Be yourself too, if he really loves you, then he'll come around and you should just tell him bluntly that you have strong feelings for him as well.|`|HinSwo97aa	maybe you aren't sure of your feelings <br>  or maybe you like him too much to express.<br>  <br>  get him a card or gift or a secret you share<br>  let him know your feelings and that you care about him<br>  <br>  words aren't needed to express feelings.|`|wvloojLaaa	my friends say their girlfriends say how strong they are and how sweet they r. just come up with those or say hes the best boyfriend ever and u wanna be with him for a while.<br>  <br>  ps: im not gay i just know this stuff from my last relationship|`|B0MnPfh7aa	i would hurry up n say sumin otherwire he gunna go. just say what you think, men like truthful women|`|DcrI9zmkaa	The words need to come from *your* heart...not ours.<br>  <br>  (How would you feel if you found out he had someone telling him to say this or that to you?)|`|GmbuL7Bgaa	The best thing I can think of to say is:<br>  <br>  Find that thing to say that combines being honest with being polite.  :)|`|ldQFvpHxaa	if you really love him inside, your heart will let you know whats right to say.|`|1I4TuZc7aa	tell him that you love him more then life itself its so so so so so sweet|`|JzK59nt1aa	do you love him? if so then tell him that. If you like him a lot but aren't sure about the love thing yet, say something like "you mean the world to me" or "you always know how to make me smile " - after he says something that actually makes you smile. Just tell him how you feel, even if it feels silly or doesn't come out in the most "romantic" way, if it's what you are feeling, and it is completely you, that will mean the most to him rather than some pre-rehearsed lines|`|zWI5Q6oEaa	something like a poem would work.<br>  this is a link to a poem from Kingdom Hearts<br>   i read to my boyfriend and he melted(in a good way)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.quizilla.com/poems/8731668/kairis-letter" rel="nofollow">http://www.quizilla.com/poems/8731668/ka...</a>|`|7qWLbKJ6aa	if you really dont know hot to tell him write him letters and he will understand well atleast that's what i did at first and now i still have trouble but he already know i love him|`|4fC6EJWfaa	get him a nice card and write him a letter of everything you want to say, don't hold back, it'll be easier than saying it out loud...|`|D8bTsWr8aa	When you feel its okay tell him.|`|2vBYTCUDaa	For the longest time I told my boyfriend that he "makes me happy" this was enough until we took the next step and finally said that godforsaken L word. don't say it until you are ready. you will know when you are ready because it will just come out one day.|`|ogOUXyCXaa	i tell my baby that he is my everything. he loves it<br>  the one that got him the hardest though was:<br>  baby you have my heart. and you can keep it forever|`|xw13XqNaaa	Tell, him that you really think that he is great and you feel really good when you are around him.  That will make him feel good and realize you have something special.|`|yfQjliFWaa	say something from the heart, i know that's no help, but it's completely the best thing for someone to understand that you like them.<br>  if he thinks that it's cheesy, then its whatever.
71VRvldJaa	There's only one way to find out!  You'll never know if you don't give it a go!|`|C8DOT8Y7aa	Establish a more-than-just-friends relationship. Start by asking her for something to play on, like if you are in her class, ask her for a pencil or eraser. If she's slightly interested, she might play about, teasing you for it. Don't worry, it's not that she doesn't like you. She expects you to play along, so maybe walk off in mock sulk, don't do it too heavily though. She might start to think you are weird if you do. If she comes by you and asks you who you like, you know you are on the right track. They are probably just as nervous as you, so they want to get that type of approach as well. This probably means that they like you, and your job just got much easier. <br>  Compliment her, but be careful. Unless they are desperate, they might think you are desperate or making something too obvious. So maybe tell her you like her new hairstyle but then go behind her and mess around with it, spice it up. She'll like your courage to go play about with her hair but make sure she doesn't have dandruff or lice because although you might not be too bothered, she will get embarrassed and scared to go near you. Also, don't lay it on like you've seen in the movies: "I like your handbag.". No guy, in school, will honestly care about a handbag. Something you might truly like you can compliment on. <br>  Start a ball game (not literally). Be a little far away and look at her, admire her. She'll catch your gaze and look at you. Look away suddenly but keep an eye out for her looking back at you. If she is, get up and walk past her, possibly giving her a little smile as you go. <br>  Have chats with her. Ask her if she has any pets and find out some interesting things. Make sure she knows you inside out as well. <br>  Move in closer, be alone and look down. Look up at her eyes, look lost in her world for a second, and then say "I,(pause),like you. So...(cough)..Will you go out with me" While you say this look down. Look up when you say me and smile questioningly. If that isn't your style, there is another way to ask a girl out. All you have to do is walk up (make sure she's alone), and ask her to go out with you in a confident (but relaxed!) manner. <br>  Don't try too hard, girls aren't stupid, they can tell when you get desperate. Be relaxed and confident in yourself. <br>  Don't just become friends with her, become friends with all of her friends, as relationships are made and broken on her friends' opinions. <br>  If she says no, she means NO. Just back off for awhile, leave her to cool down, but don't give up complete hope. <br>  Be confident, not cocky. The difference is there, and very noticeable for girls. Make jokes and be self-confident; women love it when men make them laugh. <br>  When the time comes to ask her out, wait for the opportune moment. Trust your instincts; they will tell you when the time is right. As mentioned earlier, it's probably best not to do it in front of her friends or in front of your friends. It's easier for both of you if you are alone. <br>  If she says "I'll think about it" it's not a good sign, although she could just be nervous, or caught up in the moment, and she's being careful not to make a stupid mistake. Don't bug her about it, let it go a few days - if she doesn't bring it up again, it's a no. <br>  Don't ask her out as a dare, or as a joke - this can really hurt a girl's feelings. Be sure that you are doing it because you want to, if you don't you could really become known as a jerk. <br>  If you see any facial expressions, like an eye raise, make sure you say, "it's okay if you say no."|`|03GQ637Raa	When no one is around the girl you want to talk to, go up to her and ask her if she has seen MADEA GOES TO JAIL (or whatever movie you think she might like to see).  If she says no, ask her to the movie and get something to eat.  If she says she does want to go out, your all set.  If she says no to the movie that you suggested, then ask her what she wants to see.  If she give you another movie that she would like to see, well your over. But if she gives you a all out NO answer, try to direct your desires to someone else that may be liking you. smile!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|bYvGNvrvaa	Just ask her or ask her if she likes you still and if she says no then be like okay well i was just wondering and then walk away.|`|VTLf2l49aa	ask her out   can anyone answer mine  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Apeo9gMnjgbO1QRpBFaxrOfsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090226160744AAjvrzV">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|091LTWTCaa	Ask her out, it doesn't hurt!|`|XvjfvGohaa	ask her! if she liked you once changes are she will like you again, or does. you should ask her because if she says yes you'll know and be happy. if she says no then at least you know she doesn't, and knowing is so much better then wondering. i hope things go well good luck =]|`|Svo5Kqbyaa	be friends with her first. there is a better chance of her saying yes if you know her and she knows you. good luck.|`|LB8hxnrhaa	awww. cute just try and to be rlyyy good friends 1st and then go for it! good luck =]] and hav fun!|`|jPQQkvr5aa	i think you should tell her you like her.... then when/if she says it back ask her out!|`|eAx9wk1zaa	do waht u think the cole train wood do|`|TU8XNpBMaa	ASK HER OUT!<br>  i am a girl, and i can tell by ur story she likes u!

fpxrI6w9aa	You probably could. But you would have to prove that both the her mother and her would be unfit to raise the children, and it would also probably be a fairly long court case due to the complexity of the situation. It isn't definite that you would win the case but there would be a good chance
auUeI2Vnaa	Maybe she is awful, but what teenagers veiw as awful isn't always all that bad.<br>  <br>  Yes, she can force him as his legal gaurdian.  She can't force him physically, but she can take away all his belongings and what not until he listens to her.  Why doesn't he want a job anyway?  Is he lazy? The first thing I did when I turned 16 was find a part job...|`|Rf2r23sYaa	I'm not sure. She could kick him out if he doesn't get a job. Yeah, she's supposed to let him live with her until he's 18 but if she kicks him out what is he going to do, sue her?|`|AA10558731	Most people are eager to get a job and start earning their way by 16. Many want to start working earlier than this - there are always questions here from people younger than that looking for ways to find work.<br>  <br>  She shouldn't have to force you to get a job, you should be actively looking for work. It sounds to me like your mom isn't being an a****** at all, she's looking out for your best interests by encouraging you to find a job.<br>  <br>  Er ... I mean your *friend's* mom, of course (rolls eyes). So tell your "friend" to get off the computer, put down the video game controller, pick up the classifieds section of the local paper, and start looking for gainful employment.|`|MoUtk7cUaa	no, but she can make it necessary for him, by not giving him his allowance anymore, etc .  it will teach him the need for Independence, financial responsibility, work ethics, etc. regardless of how much of a  (whatever) she may be, she's probably just trying to prepare him for the real world, because when he's 18, she can kick him out and if he's not ready, he's really gonna hate her.|`|7511595fc4d3e31538e8df239de8a7c5aa	a kid 16 SHOULD HAVE a job.  what do you think he should do, lay around on his behind?|`|mDJInjEaaa	nope no oen can force u to do anything|`|LrqwhwYYaa	No, but she's also not required by law to give him anything more than necessities. So, if he wants extra spending money..he could work 10-15 hours on the weekends.  No big deal.|`|403ae76cb156bafcf8690d7a4a679bb3aa	As long as he lives under his mom's roof AND is under 18, then yes, he must obey as far as I know.|`|ODJ9YWeAaa	no she cant

AA11996507	Report her and her employer(s) to the IRS.

1k6UUC8qaa	he probably didn't think about it.  The secret to staying married and having a good marriage is stop living like you are single.  so i suggest you both delete your social websites and if you must have one have one for both start your married life right and make sure everyone know you are in it for the long haul.  You are a couple and everyone should know it especially your exes that way there is no jealousy or unfaithful issues to worry about at least from the websites.  Every one i know that has social websites have problems from the same its time to grow up just delete them you don't need them.|`|AnW3dzQfaa	Yes, he's up to something.  He is obviously a play boy if it took him 10 years to settle down.  Why did you marry him knowing that he cheated on you?|`|mCM363I9aa	you need to ask him not us, he knows if he is up to something and maybe he is but don't accuse him yet unless you have proof. However, him having an ex on there that he cheated on you in the past is enough proof for me.|`|4730f63171a75d70e37097828a42d695aa	If being friends with exes isn't appropriate in your relationship with him then he has to respect that or leave, maybe you should both eliminate all exes in your lives to prove your commitment to one another x|`|b99c02d2efcaf0924dc72f729d7ae118aa	ay ay ay. if he cheated on her with you, what makes you think he won't cheat on you with someone else, or with her???|`|3RHSSEDnaa	A Leopard Never changes his spots!|`|OhgfDmJAaa	Oh NO why get married now!!! a bit of paper and a party doesn't change a thing ... ive seen this happen before together for years married for months!!! SAD BUT TRUE!!!   Seems to me you domt trust him..
3iNobwVraa	In english!  Don't send song lyrics.  I hate symbolic communication in lieu of straight talk.  <br>  <br>  People can handle anything when you say it straight out.  When you avoid doing so.....you have purchased a one way trip to awkward city!  Only way out--straight talk--but you wouldn't be there if you were capable of that, so. yeah, it's generally a one-way trip.
4hGiHtNhaa	I don't think you should ignore him, but it doesn't sound like he likes you like you like him. I think he likes you- but only as a friend. When he said he was not interested, but that only means to date you. But he still wants to be your friend. I know you like him as more than a friend, but he only likes you as a friend, but a really good friend. Just try to be friends and not let your romantic feeling get in the way of a friendship. And who knows, maybe once you two hang out as friends more he may like you the same way you like him! I hope i was help! Good luck!|`|UGQt96UKaa	he sounds like a flirt haha. but you should just be friends with him, just play it cool. but try not to flirt with him cuz a guy like him would prolly flirt back and then there would be no chance of getting over him. trust me i had the same problem. and it helps to have a lot of guy friends too so your life isnt just focused on one guy. i hope i helped!!|`|fly3xBZ4aa	If he's your good friend, maybe he doesn't want that to change by u guys starting to date. After all in the end when people break up they never go back to the way they were before they got together.|`|BUKLPCfWaa	He wants to be friends and hang out, he just doesn't want to be your boyfriend.  Maybe after you're friends for a while he'll change his mind.|`|i7EMqQq5aa	Well being "tight" to him probably just means that he wants to be closer to you, and since you still like him, then you can stop ignoring him and talk to him.|`|hQGnyKL2aa	Wow., now that is something.. I know you still like him and avoiding him will totally hurt you, now try accepting the friendship he is offering, like being good friends, being close too each other. We never know what may happen, maybe he was just shocked for the fact that you confessed that you like him and he wanted to get to know you better. At least his open and maybe he also likes you too, but wanted to know more about you before getting involved. Don't hurry up things. Sometimes being best of friends is much more than being in a relationship :)|`|XCvQnantaa	the hell is wrong with this kid I mean the guy not you|`|3iNobwVraa	Ask him, "how tight do you plan on being?" with a teasing smile.  His response should clarify the situation! :)
AHUOVgQBaa	She gave him herpes?? lol jk i didn' t really help because then you would prob have them too. well good luck!|`|VrmlehM2aa	oh wow, <br>  im really sorry :/<br>  <br>  its really going to be hard to get over this situation.<br>  but don't put up with people who are reckless with your heart.<br>  <br>  you just have to realize that you are so much better than to have a cheating gf like yours.<br>  <br>  i know it will be hard, but your best bet is to get rid of your gf if you haven't already.<br>  <br>  time is the best cure for a broken heart and once again im sorry.<br>  <br>  <br>  just stay strong.<br>  YOU'RE TOO GOOD OF A PERSON FOR HER!|`|y9icmRcYaa	Honestly... it's almost impossible. I have been there and I even went to see a counselor.. it came down to me asking myself if this person I was dating was truly worth the pain, anger, jealousy etc.. I can tell you that it really doesn't get easier. You can bury it but, it's always there. <br>  <br>  Have you been with your girlfriend for a long time? Do you love her? Do you see a very, very long future with her? If you answered yes to ALL OF THOSE QUESTIONS... then it's worth trying to seek counseling, read books, pray or whatever you do to feel better. If not, don't waste precious time in your life that you will never get back.. <br>  <br>  Good luck, I know it hurts =/|`|dwLcMz1faa	you can get a new girlfriend, unless you really like her, or you can kick his as. i would do both.|`|P1MhOhqCaa	kill her|`|Ax1x2NrLaa	kick that mofo's *** so hard he won't be able to sit down for a while. And dump that B  I  T   C   H.|`|HGAckCtHaa	Whoa.  Is she still your girlfriend?  Did she know he was your worst enemy and she did it anyway?  If she is still your girlfriend, you need to rethink things.  What she did was hurtful and despicable and if she did it knowing how you feel about this guy, then she doesn't deserve to be with you.<br>  <br>  You might be blaming your enemy, but your girlfriend is the person who broke your trust.  I think only time will help you get over this.  It's going to take time to recover from such a hard blow, but you will.  Trust me when I say that you deserve much better and I hope you find that person.

It shows maturity, responsibility, dependability and intelligence. All very sexy qualities in a man.<br>  <br>  BTW..... If a beautiful WOMAN stays with one man even though she could get any man she wanted with a flip of her hair does that mean she has low self confidence?<br>  <br>  I think it's exactly the opposite.|`|bdiSM1UXaa	Because the guy that would think that he can get anyone he wants would probably end up with a woman who thinks the exact same thing. So, if she would refuse to stay with a man who cheats on her and he really wants her, he would have to trade sexual variety for emotional fulfillment.|`|9x0pLKnvaa	He would settle because he has a heart! He must love her!|`|zkHwRCm3aa	no that is not true. My man is a one woman man, he treats me like a queen, infact, and he has perfect confidence, and he is manly, likes hunting fishing quads, chopping firewood, taking out the trash...LOL<br>  <br>  It's called P*ssy whipped.<br>  You'll know when you find a good enough lay, with a pretty face.<br>  <br>  And it also has a lot to do with love.<br>  Being permiscuous is not confidence, it's straight up dangerous these days.<br>  <br>  your best bet is to find a nice clean girl, whom you can trust and who is a freak in bed. then you should have no worries.|`|AA11646252	He has pride, respect and knows what responsibility is.<br>  <br>  rd|`|T9kMy13Haa	That may be true for the most part. But I think if you are more mature it doesn't happen. I'm guessing you're a teenager (like everybody in the singles and dating forum) and teenagers are just immature in general and cheat a lot. But there are very mature teens out there who can be both confident and monogamous. I have a girlfriend and I've passed up straight up offers of sex before.|`|6q76Rgiqaa	Because us guys are loyal and faithful to their girl.  We don't only have confidence, we have moral and value.  If one love her, she should be the only one for us and not any other girl.  Hurting people's feeling is not cool man.  Its not a game unless you're a player which equals loser.|`|bYvGNvrvaa	No, i just think there cocky a holes and they'll be the ones ending up lonely in life.|`|ExaerfDraa	you sound like an imature douchebag who cheats on his woman. Good luck with that buddy.
bf8d2eafddec1290877a14d1fc35d99aaa	I had this same problem and I'm a dude. My best friend was talking trash about me behind my back and my close friend told me about it. I decided not to confront him, but one day in math class I completely overheard him talking about me and so did the rest of my class. So I was like "I can completely hear you talking about me." He was shocked because I'm not very talkative at school, and he forgot that I was in the class as well. I think you should try and catch them in the act. That will save your friend from getting the backlash when you confront them, because it will seem like it was just a coincidence. You could always ask another person to make sure it's true and use them as your source instead of your close friend. Hope it goes out well, stay strong...|`|20da7e19a185ca8c01b2a311761afcd6aa	Ive had this problem also. Just find new friends. nothin will change. its jealousy, or anger. just run from all the drama, and be around happy people who dont start crap.
JhvqUvlsaa	Not at all. And I am a Christian so I know where I'm going after I die (I mentioned that cuz you're name is GOD IS LOVE. :) )|`|BQUU5vp8aa	In a way. It's more that I'm disgusted by decomposition and how bodies change when they die. It's so gross to me. It makes me want to be cremated. That's what really freaks me out about death<br>  Dying it self also scares me a guess, because I don't know if there is anything after, and what it would be, or if I'll just end.|`|kLNhAEVpaa	Not so much death as what happens after death.

xRZ1PRZwaa	Hi! I think the issue at hand is more a societal one as opposed to a relational one.<br>  <br>  If we're teaching our children, regardless of gender, to be respectful, assertive and appreciative, while maintaining their own sense of self-importance, then we'd all be a lot happier. Rather, we are seeing a greater many individuals who suffer from the 'me-me' mentality, and frankly, that unattractive characteristic will doom any marriage. It's really gross manipulation - luring a person in, lying to solicit love, and then pulling the blanket out from under the bed of lies once the marriage certificate is signed. We need to teach our children that that behaviour isn't alright right from the start.<br>  <br>  I think it's for both genders as well. Women have suffered for years from men who might be controlling, abusive, and the lot. Men have suffered for years from women who do the same.<br>  <br>  I think the biggest difference between the two though is that it almost seems alright with society when a woman does it to a man. Well, I don't think it is.<br>  <br>  My husband's ex-wife used to slap him in the face, take money out of his wallet, tell him he wasn't allowed to go out, and take off all day long leaving him alone with the children. When her son was born, she put earplugs in so as not to be disturbed by the crying. I'll stop that sad story here.<br>  <br>  The irony is that if a man had done to a woman what was done to my husband, women and men would be livid. But, my husband got "ha ha, you're whipped," and "don't be a wimp". My husband isn't whipped and most certainly isn't a wimp. He was lied to and cheated, and continues to pay dearly for his expending trust.<br>  <br>  So, if a man's alternative is to stay single versus marrying a young, narcissistic, greedy taker who's only lied and manipulated her way into a marriage, I agree - end it and stay single. I would say the same to a woman.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, just to say, there are many North-American women who are beautiful, vibrant, bright and honest. Just the same, there are some incredible men out there. In fact, I know many of them from each gender. I suspect we just need to watch for cues and clues a little better, exercise better self-awareness and be honest with ourselves when we meet someone to avoid certain disaster.<br>  <br>  *Edit<br>  These stories - no - experiences from people who see their children held as emotional hostages make me sick to my stomach. When their separation was still fresh, my husband's ex told him that he could see his son anytime, but only his daughter if he paid her $500 extra. So, I understand how hard what you're going through is, really, and I'm sorry that it's happening to you. There are women out there, though, who wouldn't hurt themselves, their children, or you like this regardless of how the marriage ended. If it helps, it does get easier over time. The anger, frustration and incredible sense of injustice do calm.|`|0KLu4hRaaa	Ah my little Russian friend. Boy you Russian men have a real attitude going don't you? See how raciest and sexiest that sounded. You might want to try avoiding posting sexiest questions. Furthermore, just because your ex is a horrible person does not mean ALL American women are.  Sounds like you married a bad apple and now want all American women to pay for it. Shame on you. Oh and if you feel the need to bash me in your little commentary I am half Caucasian and half Italian--just so you get your comment right.|`|jvHIqtp2aa	Yes, in fact I am planning on putting mine in the car in the near future and driving him as far away as I can.|`|vImloZKOaa	Yes.|`|6OnqUyseaa	Truth is, things such as this happens to women, too.   In both sexes it happens.  There is the good - and there is the bad - with men and women.<br>  <br>  It's actually an age-old thing which usually happened to more women - than to men.<br>  <br>  It seems that lots of women are just walking away from the men .. times have changed in this era .. and for good reason.<br>  <br>  It's not just one sex .. many people have been burned severely.|`|DJMPQlFDaa	Sorry. I don't like the laws of marriage in America or is it divorce. Either or it's not right and it's not fair. I have a huge sense of fairness. I believe that if you get married things need to be kept separated. Both partners should work, Like you stated either opposite work shifts (as me and my husband do) or hire a babysitter. I am for equal rights whether it be a man, woman, or child. I think everybody needs to be treated with respect and fairness.<br>  <br>  People are very lazy now. You have the stay at home mom that refuses to keep the house clean and as soon as the father home goes out to the club. You shouldn't be going to go out to the club if you are married and have kids. Unless you hire a babysitter and you are going on a date with your spouse.|`|6xOu8xXCaa	American women want strong hardworking husbands who are trust worthy and will share in the responsibilities of raising children and holding down a full time job full time!  It takes two to run a household these days.|`|iKJycf6Zaa	This nomarriage.com is somebody's point of view. It does not necessarily mean that American Women are driving their men away. It is  men who prefers certain type of women.|`|s0WkZ9Ecaa	I dont think thats every african american woman actually any race can drive a man away seems like the media sometimes make it seem that it's just the african american women|`|9q70kt7vaa	=/ sounds like of stereotypical to me|`|e2cea16fef607c412fce74237c66ecc2aa	um depends on the women|`|mCoipTkbaa	im not....|`|b423d42c76a871f7b36abba90dc4c41daa	I am american.If I marry an American woman the odds of divorce are 55%.If I marry an Asian woman it drops to 7% If I marry an African woman its 11%.A Russian woman...9.5%<br>  <br>   Why on earth would I marry an American woman ??|`|ScHW4842aa	I didnt bother looking at your link. <br>  <br>  Your question is very sexist. <br>  <br>  How about this: <br>  Are American men driving their women away?<br>  The cheating, lying, having bachelors parties with strippers etc etc? <br>  <br>  What do you think? <br>  I think that you are one in a million who actually worked and did the right thing. You think guys actually see that as their role anymore? pffft. Its still clubbing and partying even after marriage. Thats why it all breaks up. <br>  <br>  My husband started that bullsh*t. I put a quick stop to it.
TpvckQPgaa	they always look at you when they think you dont see them<br>  it looks like they have doubts for not being friends with you<br>  trying to get you to be jealous<br>  and yea like trying to get attention when your around :D|`|B14s72TNaa	some people will just give a gesture, or use body language... they might hand you something that u r reaching for, smile at u in the hall, or just stop talking about you(or whatever they were doing so u werent friends) u might be able to tell by how they r standing or how they r looking... if they are bubbly and happy they probly just dont care anymore, but if they are just emotionless around u that prbley means they r still mad.|`|Rf9eWfCvaa	They might look at you, smile, give a little wave, make eye contact, do something nice for you, just be friendly, try to say something to you but shy away, ect....|`|WGVHKF7Aaa	A good sign would be that they tend to hang around you more often or don't avoid you.

But, as everyone says - it's your day so do whatever you want.|`|NroZQN5vaa	It's your wedding. If you want to dance with both of them, do it. If they're both that important to you, your guests will understand.|`|v7ZmPEwOaa	its your wedding dance with both. plus nobody is going to a wedding and leave unfed.|`|sLwmzvi8aa	i would play the songs as long as they are... and it does not matter what your guests think... its your wedding|`|66hMQmyyaa	I agree with the other girls! This is your wedding, do what you want! An idea though to help your piece of mind.....do the fathers/daughter dances while your guests are entertained! <br>  <br>  For example....I am doing a father/daughter dance and my H2B is doing a Mother/Son dance. We have decided since they are kinda long, we are going to save those dances for after the cake cutting! So then, while the cake is being passed around to the guests, they can eat their cake and watch us dance. That way they don't get bored and we can have our moment without worrying if people will be bored!<br>  <br>  Whatever you decide, I hope everything works out and keep in mind that this is your day and ultimately you and your H2B need to be happy :)|`|sucyG6oMaa	I think that is lovely. I see no problem with you wanting to have a dance with each of your dads.  It is your wedding and the one chance they get to have a father/daughter dance with you on your wedding day.  :)  Don't cut the songs short and do it!  I think your guests will enjoy it, it's sweet. <br>  <br>  If you have a chance would you mind looking at my question about engagement rings?  I would really appreciate your opinion!|`|F2lUn0moaa	It's your wedding.  Dance a full dance with both.  Your wedding guests are there because they are special to you or your groom and will probably enjoy seeing you dance with your "dads".|`|CyBrshFCaa	that is perfectly fine you can do whatever you want go right ahead

Well, I'm not anywhere near an expert on this kind of thing, but hopefully those helped, and I wish you the best of luck.<br>  Edit<br>  Just read FFAF's answer too, agreed... don't turn to drugs or alcohol, never a good choice for solving a problem in my opinion.|`|5zwcnmOIaa	don't think of it like that. think of it as a passing of generations of your family in their spot in the circle of life. just let nature take it's course and you shall be at peace.|`|9hFexadLaa	me: thanks, it's been hard<br>  <br>  sorry to hear about that man|`|tVPyRHEJaa	just know that she is in a much better place and watching over her family <br>  death is always hard to deal with|`|Sc51ASmqaa	She is in a better place! and not suffering anymore! she will be watching over you...
vOomJtbsaa	I saw this question before it was deleted.  Your answer is lovely!  :)<br>  I fully agree, definitely don't want to burn bridges with the MIL this early in the game.|`|DJMPQlFDaa	Your so sweet and thoughtful. I am sorry I didn't see the question. I normally might check the adoption section, marriage, polls, and Dayvid questions.But please know you are one of my 3 favorite contacts.|`|D3gXitsoaa	That was kind of you to take the time to write your great answer.  Karma to you!
oPomvXgJaa	So first of all...I would like to say...Freaking HUGE coincidence! same name....super similar situation...wow...anywho...the answer....<br>  <br>  A few months ago, One of my friends got mad at me because they believed a false rumor that I was talking behind their back. When I found out this, I approached her and told her that it was not true. She did not believe me. She told my other friends and they soon stopped talking to me too. I had no one, just like you. My family thought I had the perfect life and there weren't any people at church or school I could talk to anymore because of my so called "friends." I became completely anti-social, never talking to anyone. All I ever did was read and do school work. Everything about me changed. The color of my clothing became darker, my hair was always covering my eyes, physical pain felt so damn good while emotional pain tore through me like I had literally been torn in two. I became, in all meanings of the word, emo. I cut myself to make the emotional pain leave. I had been cutting for almost a month when I found one other girl at school that hadn't been affected by the blazing rumors going around about me. She had been attempting to talk to me for weeks but I had blown her off everytime. When I finally let her in, I told her everything. I instantly felt better. I stopped cutting, and I slowly became myself again. Me and the girls made up, but I rarely talk to them because what they did to me is something I can barely forgive and defintiely not forget.<br>  <br>  My experience and the fact that I am telling you about it is not meant to drive you to find a blade and cut, not to become anti social or anyhing like that. I told you my story because I want you to see what happened to me when I let what they said get to me. Put it all out of mind. Find new friends and try your hardest to get on with your life. Hon, it will definitely be hard, and the only person that will get you through this is yourself. Find your own inspiration to keep going. Mine was writing. Every night, I got onto my computer and wrote. Now, I have 5 chapters of a book I plan to write. Your inspiration to keep going might be a collection of poetry or the newest top 100 song. Whatever you like to do  more than anything else, do it. Make a super playlist of independent woman songs and play it 24/7 or listen to sappy love songs...whatever works for you!<br>  <br>  Suicide is never the answer. It causes more problems than it solves. Maybe not for you, but for the people you leave behind.<br>  <br>  I am very sorrry about the situation with your parents. My parents are doing the same thing. If I were you, I would attempt to sit your parents down one night and tell them that if they want you to succeed than they need to back the hell off. That is what I did and it has definitely helped.<br>  <br>  Let me know if you ever wanna talk or if ya ever need help!<br>  <br>  Hope everything sorts itself out for the best!|`|AcmfbJVpaa	God do not bring misery into our life we do it ourselves.  and no you don't offend me you are lost and confuse and you need to talk to some one that is willing to listen- your friends are not your friends this are only people that you know<br>  and if they believe false rumors is their problem<br>  you kill your self and then what you will not solve any ting- what you need to do go talk to a preacher you will be surprise how much they listen and they will never bring wash you about religion|`|fe50acba38be59ae06e53207946ede13aa	we sound a ton alike!<br>  i too get super stressed out and think that way too.<br>  but once i calm down i realize that killing yourself would put 2398473 times the pressure and depression on everone else in your life!<br>  even if they are acting bad to you right now or putting pressure on you, thats not fair to anyone else!<br>  <br>  everything will get better, and not because of some fictional person people trust with their lives, but because it happens to the best of us. we all get down (some more often than others) but there is a way to make it better eventually!<br>  and i promise it will if you give it a chance.<br>  wait a few years, fall in love and live your life!!!<br>  =]|`|06Rlukp7aa	I would look for online support groups to go to. Survivors of suicide and that kind of thing. Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem. It forever devastates the lives of those we leave behind. (May God be with you, no sorry didn't mean that in a trite way to sweep away your sorrows but in a real and comforting way.)|`|bLUgbyLHaa	You did not mention how old you are. I am not going to give any God talk, suicide is NOT the easy way out it only hurts the ones around you I know I have tried. I tell you I should be dead but to tell you the truth life is just damn precious to leave it. If they where true friends they would stick by you and not be live in any of the rumors I would almost bet that if sat down with your folks and tried to tell them how you feel things will change for the best. I wish you all the luck on this I know it is not easy to cope with the world at times. I will close with that even though you do not be live God will always be their for you. Sorry  I know i said that i would not go their.|`|inCByaonaa	Right now all this will seem just too much to cope with but over time and when you look back you will realise things were not as bad as you thought. These life lessons will make you stronger in the long-run. Ive been there lots of time and thought i couldnt cope but i did and am glad i did. Talk to your friends and ask them what their problem is with you. Also, your parents want the best for you but it isn't fair if it is putting too much pressure on you. Could you possibly talk to them? Take care xxxx :)|`|Ah9nRiidaa	Honestly everyone has really hard times in there life. <br>  Me personally all in one week my grandma died my boyfriend of two years told me he was sleeping with my best friend on that day my mind was so out of it that I started doing bad in my classes and the person that was supposed to be a friend was telling everyone that we had sex..I thought about doing stupid things to but seriously life goes on, everything in time will pass and don't call those backstabbers friends get better ones because there not worth it your better then that. <br>  -Hang in there<3|`|sb5CKfWQaa	First of all.  It's OK to be sick and tired of life.  It's ok to le stuff get to you and it's ok to get stressed out over everything that is going on.  I know that when I was in high school I was terribly depressed and I couldn't stand it when people would say "don't let it get to you" because it's OK to be pi**ed off.  Suicide is NOT the easiest way out and Deep down you know that or you wouldn't be here.  I can tell by the fact that you care enough about life to be stressed out that you don't want to put your loved ones through that.  Life may suck right now and even though in  5 years none of this will matter... right now it hurts and Its hard but dont give up it will get better.  And I know you don;t want to hear it but God is real.  Even when bad things happen he is real and whenever your ready... he's waiting and he loves you|`|xO9HeDWCaa	Since you mention your parents, you have not lived long enough to even know what is ahead for you. It sounds like you need some self-confidence. If you develop this, and I mean do it in a hurry, you won't even care what your friends are doing or saying. Don't think about suicide, please. Your parents probably aren't as bad as you make them out to be. They would never get over it if you committed suicide. You can talk to someone. You say you can't, but maybe you are just too embarrassed about the way you are feeling right now, but you CAN talk to a counselor or some adult. No one will know you are having these feelings unless you reach out to someone in your area. Everyone gets down at times. I certainly do, but suicide is not an option. You life's destiny might be that of someone who will save another's life. You may be a great teacher or wife. Who knows what you are intended to become. Hang in there and get some help. Please!
GQUaFGHLaa	I am a stupid sucker for love. I thought that my husband loved me but guess that I was wrong.|`|LMIbr1aeaa	No. Just sex. I hate it, when a woman in general corners me like in a game of chess.  Like if she has power over us men in general.  Yep!

Don't compromise in the meantime.|`|9UQlhzitaa	i guess if your asking am i a hopeless romantic then yes other than that.<br>  <br>  Well i know what i'm doing in the relationship;so if kindness,compassion,caring,and wanting the best for them is a sucker i guess i would qualify|`|NctuEmFKaa	Yes, i fall way to fast and way to hard!<br>  <br>  But I believe in true love and soul mates, and happy ever afters also.<br>  <br>  I also believe in all those d@mn frogs wanting me to kiss them so they can turn into a prince.|`|tMLcCfmuaa	49 years old and yes, been a stupid sucker, but not no more, no way, no how.

It takes a long time for me to go that far with someone.<br>  My girls, that's a different story.

R6hTPrldaa	Not a problem|`|DwMU437uaa	No it really doesn't matter to a guy all most guys care about is the girl herself not her hair or clothes but we do like the undies though. I have a Friend who dyed her hair blonde when she was brunette and it made everyone just think she was a slut and **** and no body wanted to date her but once she dyed it back me and everyone else wanted her to ride us all night long!!|`|sbfJ3ma6aa	if you can barely even tell then dont do it. its doing nothing but frying your hair hunny. i have naturally beach blonde hair and i completly love it,|`|ea073069c581a3e342f2f7ec101708f1aa	Yeah it's fine.....in a way.  You still did dye your hair, but it looks exactly the same. :D<br>  <br>  <br>  Answer my question please?<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090226171632AABfMpR&r=w">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|X6C6kZKKaa	yes. it's ok.|`|a45ffb40e1ff08eda37fb35f65c6eecaaa	i wouldnt mind i like brunettes so whatever|`|2imXzBHbaa	the real question is... do  you dye your pubes?|`|4Q4dZJHpaa	Do whatever you feel suits you better n be happy with it,if someone doesnt like it then thats there problem.Being comfortable with yourself is very attractive to people.I woundnt mind it,especially if its just a different shade of your natural colour|`|8QE30IXkaa	ya, being a guy, i dont care that much. i dont really enjoy redheads but if you arent a redhead than i wouldnt worry at all about your hair color.|`|FG5xXm2maa	i wouldn't care if a girl died her hair.<br>  <br>  as long as it isn't nasty green haha. (like some blondes dye the hair brown, and their hair fades to green)|`|ZBQN8viuaa	the only died hair i dont like is black, and i absolutely hate people who die there hair super blonde like they think its actually looks good to have hair that blonde|`|bYvGNvrvaa	No they don't mind, sometimes its for the better.|`|08ff27fe3110ddd7da36736daaf4c2dfaa	SHUT UP!!!! PLEASE SHUT UP!.............|`|Qe95LNxYaa	it is fine whit i have no problem whit it just don't say nothing about it till some one ask you about it|`|QY2Bqvifaa	yeah, that should be fine.|`|JzK59nt1aa	well dying your hair is dying your hair. I think guys just like girls who can be comfortable and confident in their own skin, its more about that than if you dye your hair or not.<br>  But if dying your hair makes you more confident and feel better about yourself than who cares what some guys think? They probably wont be able to tell and like I said before, guys like girls who are confident, so if that makes you confident then in turn guys would like you more instead of less|`|HdCo22Ggaa	not really a problem but sometimes there is a reason you were born with a certain hair color =p i have a friend who dyed her hair blonde it didnt suit her at all i even lost attaction to her i didnt realise it till she dyed her hair back to normal|`|GZ9LjS13aa	This is like asking if my shoes would look better with white laces or black laces, when the shoes are a combination of black and white. It is the same thing,  hes a guy, he wont really notice or care. Because he loves you.|`|xG7sujZyaa	well as long as its not a big shade and its ok if you put like a streak of green or something as long as its subtle its fine just dont go from brunete to blond thats to big of a change...?|`|M33rc7I0aa	Ummm...dont worry be you and thats straight up becuase if you keep changing for guys you will lose your mine and most guys dont care...never mind most guys dont even notice lol|`|2e1448df818c717fc359ebfd4ad381c3aa	ok you have to be more confident in your self <br>  because what ever you like a guy who worth your time will like it too<br>  <br>  you dont need some random guys oppinion|`|2hb0Lr2Raa	i don't care if a girl dyes her hair as long as it matches her skin tone, eyes, etc. some blonds do look better brunette etc.|`|4g1hvV9yaa	yeah this is okay. just don't mention it to guys unless they bring it up. secrets never hurt anyone. lol.|`|IFz3MvQeaa	Thats ok. I dont actually see anyway why dyeing their hair is a problem.|`|HKoLBQBUaa	why do u care if it makes him guys happy? if u like its its fine. be confident it way better than trying to please other ppl|`|UGQt96UKaa	yeah its fine dont worry!!! but anyway a guy should like you for you not by the fact that you dye your hair!!!!|`|bVqeoOB0aa	Just do what you want.|`|AKVMZ7MOaa	ha ha yeah well i like it both ways. But i kinda always felt like it was a way of you hiding who you really are|`|z7tkgAPSaa	i wouldn't i love it when girls mess with their hair color|`|V4oOyR0waa	no .I wouldnt care if you color your hair or not , just as long as you are happy with it!|`|dgujk2Woaa	I dont see why it would be a problem if you did that because its un-noticable but if its un-noticable hen why do it at all? but i still dont think that its a problem!!! but to be safe you should ask the guy himself and if he likes your natural better keep it natural!!!!|`|TGQhJQQhaa	Well most guys dont care about ur hair..unless its purple or blue like those weird things...were mostly into the girls personality and there looks..sometimes hair|`|2wndt5MSaa	Guys don't really care much about your hair color....it's more about YOU
UxcVv1PQaa	Its often hard to move on when that someone doesn't go away. And as hard as you fight it you can't seem to win. Often times when you love someone more than they do you it is hurtful. If he is doing that to her you are probably going to be the girl hes dating while he has other partners. Bottom line is girls want what they can't have.|`|09c8f2aa42f6255f80371d12edbfa7f6aa	You are being played, stop now, immediately, and don't put any energy in that direction at all.<br>  <br>  Being involved with him now, even flirting with him, is a breach of your own integrity and a dumb move, he's with another girl.<br>  <br>  And if he will do this to her, if he got together with you, could you expect different treatment from him?  I think not.<br>  <br>  Be smart, stop now.|`|0i4sNq2waa	wtf?|`|fe50acba38be59ae06e53207946ede13aa	i know EXACTLY what your going through!!<br>  been there done that! <br>  and believe me its SO much better to just try to move on now!<br>  if you keep liking him you have to go through the pain of seeing him with the girl he "loves" all the time! and if you ever get to be with him (if they brake up or w/e) your going to be worried all the time, what if he is with another girl like he was with me..hmmm..<br>  its just not a good feeling all over!! =[<br>  <br>  stop talking to him so much for a while..and dont hang out with him at all! even if you dont know/dont like his gf right now, idt you would want to wish this kind of pain on her. she is probably in love with him and right now he is doing the worst possible thing to her! if he is doing things like this, he isnt the type of guy you should want to be with..<br>  <br>  best of luck!!|`|oPomvXgJaa	You need to sit him down and tell him that you have feelings for him and that if he returns those feelings than he needs to ditch the girlfriend. If he says he doesn't like you like that, then tell him he needs to act like it. You need to let him know that you will not be his little fu*k buddy. If he does like you, then tell him he needs to break up with his girlfriend.|`|ghXH7JZRaa	Stay away. Any guy that would have a gf and then mess around with someone else probably hasn't done that for the first time with you. There are plenty of fish in the sea, dump him.|`|w1qFk1ytaa	STOP BEING SELFISH WOW.....Listen to yourself.....fine you like him, he likes you but what about his GF, Ur like breaking a mairrage.....stop it, you'll break a relationship.|`|NtwlsAhUaa	Seriously if he is cheating what makes you think that he will like you better? i WOULD run and FASt!|`|NUwdSa7Caa	penis|`|pxTsBlOMaa	if he is cheating on his girlfriend, what makes you think he wouldn't do the same to you?|`|A2SogiGCaa	wtf?|`|wuZXqYPGaa	YA WTF IS RIGHT.. BUT also think about it, if he is goin behind his gf's back doin this with you then why the hell would you consider datin him, heck he could do the exact same thing to you like he is doin to his girl. if you are strong enuf which im sure u r then just break it off, he can have ballz n breka up with his gf and go for you or not. he cant have both, right now ur like a girl to fool round with. most boys love the risk of havin two girls. n thats not cool|`|Ah9nRiidaa	Seriously let yourself move on!! Because if he is as inlove as he says he is with his girlfriend then he would of never made out with you or started flirting with you honestly he's playing the both of you for attention, because he thinks that whenever he gets bored with his "girlfriend" he can go to you making you the sloppy second dont put yourself into that situation it's to much work on someone that isnt worth it.|`|oA8P7nGhaa	I think you should move on. If he's cheating on his girlfriend now then if you guys got together he'd probably cheat  on you too. I know it's very hard to leave someone that you really like. But you need to gather up all the strength that you can and just move on. You could still be friends. But you can find someone better than him later in life.|`|qCgfcu6uaa	well you should talk to him and ask him if he really does like you or he's just using you for what your giving him because hes girlfriend is not by what your telling us hes a player and i think you should move on because if he is doing this to hes girlfriend then if yous were going out then he would do you the same thing and i sure you would not like it would you ?|`|y9icmRcYaa	What goes around comes around. If you were in love would you be ok with your man making out with some girl that liked him? Come on... you know what you should do... this isn't a wtf moment.

If he cheats with you, he will cheat on you.|`|npXDrahzaa	Listen, this guy saw an opportunity to take advantage of you and he did.

Now all he sees you as is a booty call, someone to hook up with when hes not around his girlfriend. Not only will you be having false expectations if you keep doing stuff with this kid, but more importantly you're hurting the innocent one, the clueless girlfriend. <br>  <br>  No matter what, homeboy will not see you as "wifey" material because you made yourself available to him. Go find yourself a guy that doesnt break hearts.|`|HJrTuihcaa	leave their relationship alone! <br>  if he truly wants you and has a crush on you then he would have broke up with his girlfriend.<br>  stop messing with other peoples relationship, it's wrong.
vyNlyfczaa	I am from Poland married to Puerto Rican... I used to lived in NC (not a lot immigrants) and a lot of my friends still are asking me if I have any single friends (from Europe) When I ask them why? - they say that we are different, we have values, we take care of your hubby and kids etc. Don't get me wrong I am not saying that American woman's don't - they just saying that we are different and our accent is hot and sexy:D|`|lgxE5nUoaa	I'm honestly not sure about this reasoning.  I'm American and my husband is Greek and between him and his family, it is drama central.  I don't even want kids - and I do my best to avoid all drama - I don't like it.|`|rDmMk9Soaa	If they are, I don't think it's for the reasons you mentioned. Not all women are like that. I hate drama, I don't withhold sex to "punish" my man (I would be the one suffering!), and I don't want kids. I'm sure there are many women who feel the same way. I know men who are turned on by specific kinds of women, like Asian for example.|`|tY4hOjqdaa	Yes, the answers on here are accurate. My Ex was consumed about money, even though I made good $$$ over 100k/yr. I did have some debt issues from a business that went south and she bailed. No values there. I made a fortune a few years later and now that I am ready for an LTR I will not rule out "going import." Women here lack the values of marriage. When the bad comes even on a temp basis they could bail. That is not what marriage is about. I know if I had a foreign wife with my temp $$$ issue I would not have been involved in a Divorce. I am sure there are guys out there that fit the standard as well with having a lack of values but the statistics show more women than men are the initiators of divorce.|`|Ag8pE3Cyaa	hey! you haven't seen drama. Try living with a French or Italian or Spanish woman....women are women in any country or culture.|`|2P2K0rl2aa	My American husband married me (I'm Australian), and his younger brother married a Filipino so yeah there's at least two.|`|6LKEWFPoaa	Obsessed with having kids?? (I guess they make those kids alone)  That is the biggest bunch of crap I have heard in a long time. Love drama? What a load of ****! Just because we don't let you assholes walk all over us, THAT is why you marry foreign women. You can treat them how ever you want and they want complain. Try that with an American woman, you will get you *** handed to you. I don't really give a **** who "american" men marry.<br>  <br>  I will never date another white man, I won't get go into detail, but I am not trying to get stalked just because they got dumped and the experience was just gross.<br>  <br>  I will never date another black american man unless he is from another country. <br>  <br>  I have no interest in American men PERIOD! So while you are sitting around bashing American women, just remember most of us don't give a ****. <br>  <br>  Manipulative? Maybe you should grow some balls?|`|Leo4z1EFaa	I agree with most of what you said and Im a woman. I hate girls for those reasons but i am not like that and I know there are others like me. We're slim to none but we're out there lol ad I have thought it was maybe they could get prettier foreign girls rather than American girls sometimes because foreign girls are probably less SHALLOW and really do care for them for whats on the inside.|`|yID81eKDaa	Yes. My second wife is Asian and is far from the subserviant door mat as frequently stereotyped.  In fact she is educated, traditional, intelligent, witty, cool, affectionate, sexy, clean, organized, and the list goes on; a wonderful and loving partner and truly my soulmate.  My first wife (American) says I'm the anti-Christ...|`|kiY9kihbaa	Foreign women make better long-term partners.  That's based on number of divorces and personal opinion, not scientific fact :P|`|J7Mmo5Xmaa	Yes and it is because of moral values.Most American women have none,or very little.Read the questions on here and you'll see what I mean.|`|MMnjWEM7aa	Absolutely!  We have many more soldiers overseas (ie. Germany and Korea) so they're more likely to meet foreign women.|`|h7N0BGfRaa	I have no idea, but my professor did and I have NO idea why!  He is just odd I guess.|`|m2eHPeciaa	yes. they marry Russian women all the time. racist a little?|`|6xXAMwxBaa	yes, because ALL american women are the same. they all fit the exact same stereotype.
AA10886262	every persons past is a clear predictor of their future......that is all I can say...you take it from here|`|XkHiFJMKaa	I think that if the relationship was really bad then she  may not do it with you but i would watch for  it|`|lg6jexk7aa	I would have to give them a chance and treat every relationship with a clean slate - regardless of my partner's past relationships.  If you go into the relationship with doubts, then this causes problems that could lead the things that you are most afraid of happening.<br>  <br>  She may have been untruthful in the start - but she has told you the truth now and has made a commitment to you - give her the benefit of the doubt|`|NctuEmFKaa	Everyone deserves a second chance.  Don't give up on her just yet.|`|fg8rLXWCaa	Everyone deserves a chance despite what they did in their past. For her to move to where you are to be with you should tell you that she really does care about you. If she didnt and was still with him she would of kept on playing the game and stayed where she was and for her to up and move is a big step. Give it a chance do not look in the past focus on the right now and the future you cant turn back the hands of time all you can do is keep moving forward. GOD BLESS!!

Especially the "strappy ones".  But they should be saved for SPECIAL "events".  Especially when worn with thigh highs hose and a garter belt. Wowee!|`|u1uECuFNaa	Yes, I can. I prefer flats, to be honest.|`|hs793CCxaa	Have you ever see a woman JUST in high heels? Or just heels and a belt? I am looking at 2 photos of my wife in both - an absolute vision!<br>  <br>  I know they hurt, but wow! they elongate the legs and look GREAT!  Yes to high heels!!|`|zNjACkxpaa	I never wore, wear, bought ,own high heels. Give me my Uggs, Chuck Tayors and Tevas and I am a happy girl|`|lyWSufFBaa	LOL...yes! I actually prefer cute flat shoes/boots. If I go out drinking with the girls I don't have to worry about falling flat on my *** lol.|`|dCmSA6r2aa	no way first of all they make me not so short<br>  second love what they do for my butt and legs<br>  third love what they do for my man when he looks at me|`|iizKx4Bvaa	sure. I am nude and barefoot most of the time except when I am in my 4 inch heels that is.lol. Got bigger fish to fry.|`|147607adf55cb5f3a236aadc7f042230aa	Hell Yes! Having to wear them everyday for work gets a bit tiring!|`|HL8PEDFLaa	I definitely can since I wear them maybe 5 times a year|`|p6QizgmRaa	Oh God, no. It helps define me as a woman.|`|jvHIqtp2aa	Yes, why wouldn't I be able too?|`|jBigEy0Caa	I'm tall, so don't wear them.|`|aDL7xmt6aa	Yes!<br>  They hurt my back.|`|gu2jV40zaa	Absolutely~! I have never been able to wear them and considering I am 5' 9" tall, heels make me look like an amazon LOL! They hurt your feet, your back and are VERY uncomfortable! I rate them right up there with thongs (sorry guys) but, they are THE most uncomfortable underwear ever and I hate them! <br>  <br>  Yes, heels and thongs are sexy but, why not just keep a few pairs for your man and leave the rest to those who LOVE to turture themselves by wearing them? I have yet to meet the woman who says "damn, these heels are SO comfortable"!|`|ZPA9RAZMaa	Yes<br>  <br>  If you wear them more than an hour, your feet start to KILL.  You fall over in them.  The heel's get stuck in every little crack in the pavement.  <br>  <br>  I have a grand total of five pairs of shoes (I don't get the shoe obsession of some girls).  Two pairs of sneakers, two pairs of thongs (Australian version, not the thong that belongs somewhere else), and one pair of heels left over from last year's school ball.  I ditched the heels halfway through dancing and ran around barefoot for most of that night.  So much better.<br>  <br>  But on the plus side, they do look pretty which makes them worth the agony some of the time.|`|eO35QeTeaa	I can! I am not a fan of heels. I rarely wear them only on special occasions and they usually end up hurting. It is no fun. I am more comfortable in regular old tennis. They are more convenient for me. I think i can make snickers sexy, lol.|`|zL8cNnJxaa	i definetly could. i mean, they can ruin your hips and create walkig problems in the future. im 15 by the way. my grandma got arthritis from wearing heels all the time. and i have wideish feet so cute heels arer hard to find.|`|c1qLIB4Eaa	Dear Edward,<br>  <br>  Same thing i also want to ask to all ladies. <br>  <br>  WHY HIGH HEELS are necessary for you?|`|wp3vYFB9aa	i would wear no shoes and run in a field of flowers if i could.. lol. sometimes i wonder why we must hurt our feet for height. though i do like to wear them to special occasions like orchestra.|`|3aPA20U8aa	if Absolutely necessary than  i guess, but getting dressed up just wouldn't be the same  neither would date night for that matter lol|`|lg6jexk7aa	Absolutely - I hate wearing shoes to begin with, so if I can get rid of my high heels, that only leaves me with my flip flops and sneakers|`|4HK2nNzRaa	Yes. I think bunions are the ugliest things that feet can sprout, which are caused by wearing heels continuously.|`|hZ8vme8Jaa	duh. i don't like them.i have skinny ankles, they are serious ankle twisters.|`|ZCf0Evqeaa	Yeah. I hate heels.|`|6486d3aebee25c8a934f5dfe45ece418aa	No, i wear heels very often..that compliment my outfits..and some flat shoes are not sexy...|`|aMHjKGU3aa	NEVER! i love high heels there hot lol
MP1nA5fRaa	I recommend a food budget, be sure to add in for toilet paper, cleaning supplies, etc.  Then split the bill 50/50.<br>  <br>  And if they are not in favor of this remind them that almost nightly you are cooking for 4 adults!  After all, they are getting a free cook out of the deal.<br>  <br>  P.S.  before everyone is settled in be sure to make a chore list on who is responsible for what.  If not you will be doing it all and that is not fair.|`|zeNov3lqaa	i say that u get food and that you just give them a bill of how much it would be a month  also just kindly explain that u have a baby and that u get tired !!!
6lRygPWqaa	if it really bothers you, you should be more forward about your issue, just tell him that you want to talk to him on the phone, not text, but it seems kind of silly to me, you shouldn't feel weird about calling him.|`|Sdveyg8Jaa	Yes i would get kind of annoyed but then you have to think he just wants to talk and he might miss talking to you! He don't really know how to start a good conversation on the phone! So really it would be a yes and no for me. Good luck!|`|mgdkr6hvaa	i understand you, i've been wanting the guy who i'm kinda with to call me first, we haven't spoke in a few days, idk what's up, idk, i know i've been in a bad mood lately so maybe he just doesn't wanna get involved w/ that but i need him now, ugh guys are just plain confusing.<br>  <br>  How long have you been going out?<br>  Maybe talk to him about it, and tell him it bothers you. Or just text i can't talk now but will you please call me in a couple hours, and if he doesn't actually call you then he might be acting like a lousy bf.|`|6m0eYhIKaa	Maybe just turn off your phone or ignore his messages. Eventually he'll get the picture. <br>  I hope this helps.<br>  And remembers: Boys are like slinkies: Useless, yet fun to watch fall down the stairs. <br>  (Just something that cheers me up when I'm having boy troubles, hope it does something for you!)|`|Wd8hcEkJaa	why would you not want your bf texting you? sounds like a middle/high school kind of relationship. so dont stress about it, chances are, eventually you two will break up.|`|q8ZEWy7Xaa	hes mad shy then lol i had a friend like that|`|JPd5PL4yaa	Apparently he doesnt like calling you he is more used to texting and most guys are either to shy/nervous to call because of the fear of not having anything to say. Dont let a phone call ruin your relationship if you like him that much. i wish you the best of luck.|`|LyIwLxl0aa	That would probably annoy me too! You should try telling him how you feel and he might understand. Your boyfriend might just be doing that to annoy you or he thinks your OK w/ him doing that. It doesn't really mean he's being a lousy BF and maybe he doesn't like to call you because he feels more comfortable texting you. Hoped I helped!<br>                  ~M.H.~|`|cWMdoLZ5aa	Uhm well that is being pretty weird when your giving him hints that you don't want to talk anymore and he's ignoring them. You might have to be harsher and get your point across more clearly. I would think that's pretty annoying.<br>  Call him. He's probably nervous about calling you.|`|fw7sE7oaaa	how long u bin goin out? coz if it's a new thing its easier for him to text than call. If it is annoyin u so much just tell him to call instead of texting u. He'll just be crazy about u and will constantly wanna keep in contact|`|8ALqoef7aa	he may be nervous about calling<br>  like he doesnt like to talk on the phone, makes him nervous<br>  just ask him!|`|1iURaHqVaa	y dont u just call him???

My fiance's family lives there and I hope we will someday too.<br>  <br>  You can tell her you want her to move with you.  Ask her to come with you to find a place and see what she thinks of it.  Don't get angry at her.  It is hard to find jobs there.  Are you nervous because it is someplace new?<br>  <br>  All you can do is to be honest with her and not sound desperate.  Either way, she will love you.  She may move there in the future.|`|Maho3P5kaa	instead you should move to the mountains of virginia, much better and alot less hick like. its gorgeous there.|`|43MRQ9eLaa	hmmm thts a little weird that you want her to move to the mountains with her.... a little incest going on maybe.... lol ok but ummm take her there and tell her that its her new home...|`|zjxr6fRsaa	She doesn't wanna move because you've been talking about her in yahoo answers..lol|`|MS1f4doJaa	Show the house and c wat she says try 2 make her feel guilty for not coming and moving in with u. and respect her decision if she says no she means it and go get a friend instead.|`|I532I4o5aa	haha tell her you'll buy her what ever she wants lol|`|K1oOQqqVaa	If you love your sister then respect her wishes and deal with it.

And, pending on when your wedding is, they tend to add more variety every other month or so. Also, they have a good variety in general, so you can probably find one with lines if you want, without lines, or both. <br>  If that doesn't work, I'd suggest going and finding a blank journal (cover), and putting glitter glue or some of the sort on the front by yourself.<br>  Also, try :::    <a href="http://www.mycustomproduct.com/designer.php?fc_prodid=personalized-writing-journals" rel="nofollow">http://www.mycustomproduct.com/designer....</a> . You can design your own journals and such<br>  Hope this helped!<br>  <br>  Jen|`|AA11082914	Not totally sure how you'd go about doing it at all, but what about creating one on your own? You could enlist the help of a crafty friend or family member and go to town.<br>  <br>  *ADD* You could probably find everything you need in the scrapbook section of your local craft store.|`|crxbob5jaa	Check Hobby Lobby stores|`|AA10722993	While I think this is a lovely idea, I don't know how you expect all of your guests to stand in line to write in one book  all of these memories!   Why not  put 4x6 white plain index cards at each place setting.  Then when everyone is seated, have someone announce what the cards are for.  That way, the people can be comfortable while they write the cards and sign their names.   It will give them time to think of  what they want to say, too.<br>  <br>  Then someone can collect them and later you can put them into a photo album for 4x6 pictures.   That way, if people use both sides of the cards, you will be able to read all of it.<br>  <br>  For favors, you could have ball point pens with your first names and the date printed on them, possibly in your wedding colors.   <br>  <br>  Just a suggestion, because there is no way you are going to get everyone to write their thoughts if they have to do it in just one book and stand there waiting for all of them to write.  And have you ever had to lean over a table to write more than just possibly your name?    Very uncomfortable!|`|ioNKVW9haa	Does it HAVE to say memories?<br>  <br>  If you're not dead set on it saying 'Memories,' I'd suggest looking for a gorgeous hard cover book with blank pages.  You can get something like THAT at an arts and craft store or a Barnes & Noble.<br>  <br>  If you positively have to have the 'Memories' on the cover, then try looking at places like Joanne Fabrics, or other stores that sell craft supplies... especially stores that specialize in scrap booking.|`|8C4eDazGaa	u can make one,,, just go to ur local craft stor and look at the srapboks and stuff|`|hkwBR1moaa	Find a nice photo album with memories on it and then go to a craft store and buy scrapbook pages and cut them up into picture/indexcard size.  That way when they write down the memory they can find a scapbook page that reflects that.
nLwDGJAGaa	Continue to be friendly towards her but don't be too agressive. After a while of being friendly you will notice that she opens up to you a little more. Then you should be able to judge her feelings more accurately.<br>  <br>  The key to winning a shy woman's heart is to become her friend and find out more about her.  That way you would know what she feels comfortable doing. It makes it much easier to transition into a more serious relationship.  Also, don't try to be too agressive or else you would scare her off.|`|wzxmWDs4aa	I'm really shy with men, but all the guys I've ever dated, I got to know as friends beforehand. If you just approach someone who's shy and ask them out on a date out of the blue, it can be a bit intimidating.<br>  <br>  What I'd do is get to know her gradually. It takes time, but if you like her as much as you say, it'll be worth it. Ask her to come out with a group of yours and her friends. Just chat to her and get to know her gradually, and after a few times start flirting. Once she is comfortable around you it will be much easier.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|iO4YHFavaa	Just keep complimenting her. tell her how beautiful she is, and talk more to her. then slowly..she will be comfortable|`|kpdqN1kJaa	Just be yourself and be there for her. She will eventually open up to you, trust me.|`|NIlDPtNeaa	Take her alone to a corner and speak your heart out.<br>  <br>  And its important to just be yourself.|`|tSmJQRU6aa	If you really like, just take it slowly and be her friend for now.|`|BN162SIcaa	She is not interested in you. If she was then she wouldn't cut it so short.|`|q8ZEWy7Xaa	tell her how u feel about her|`|Um9jbMPgaa	She is obviously uncomfortable with the thought of being alone together. So....go out as a group of friends. That way the focus won't purely be on her which she seems to struggle with. As she gets more comfortable in your presence you can then ask her out just you two. Take your time, don't rush things. If you really care about her it will be worth it in the end. Don't worry you won't lose her to another guy because if she's extremely shy to someone she knows, she will be unapproachable to someone she doesn't know.|`|cWMdoLZ5aa	Well I'm pretty shy around guys that I don't completely know yet, but it depends on how shy she is. With me, when I feel comfortable with a guy I open up and talk and show my personality, etc. <br>  <br>  Ways to make her feel comfortable would be to be friendly and smiley around her. She probably won't start any conversations if she's shy around you but try to talk to her. Give her compliments and talk to her like you are good friends, but don't be too pushy. If you have her # try texting her because that might make it easier for her to talk at first rather than face to face contact. <br>  <br>  If she keeps cutting conversations short and seems like she is trying to get away from you, she's not interested and you should probably move on.|`|BMDkMyHTaa	you might have scared her and she might have not been ready for a relationship. tell her very politely something like "oh i haven't talked to you lately. i hope this isn't because of me being silly and asking you to eat. i'm sorry about that." by saying this, you're making note that you're aware she's avoiding you and also showing you're sorry if you scared her off. if she does the same thing, it's best not to go after her anymore.|`|tatsP8tqaa	the whole point is to not approach her... ask her out in a way that she can think over and not be put on the spot... (like E-mail, text, note etc.)  that way she can think and not feel pressured to answer you but can still say yes... and if you can manage to do it in a way that really cute then you are in!|`|g9DUcz4maa	dnt feel bad, shes shy. Just give her sum time and stay friends for now just some casual group activities. Btw dnt *** on too strong and make sure u dnt bring it up until you kno shes more comfortable|`|6xXAMwxBaa	asking her to eat out is a little presumptuous. do you know if she's that kind of girl?<br>  <br>  that might be moving a little quick.|`|177fNgI6aa	Sounds like she's not feelin' you.  Sorry, dude.  Move on to greener pastures.|`|oRJOihzwaa	try to help her open up|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	I am very shy but I am not dumb. If someone likes me, I show interest back. Being shy doesn't mean that she can't date. It means she is showing signs that she is not into you.|`|VzzQP2PJaa	I'd say approach her when the two of you are alone again, and say how you feel. Let her know your not gonna put any pressure on her, you just want to hang out and get to know her. If she still says shes not up to it, well then you got your answer. Hope things work out for you though. *crosses fingers* =)|`|m1CYCNzIaa	keep trying because it may just be that she's to shy to say what she really wants to, especially if you're hot!<br>  <br>  it might be a good idea to just be a friend to her for a while so you can get to know each other and she can feel comfortable and open around you. then try asking her out again.<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|ZRS0C1CXaa	talk to her by herself make her comfortable. Dont compliment her repeatedly, talk about school, hobbies stuff that could break the ice.|`|KZdx48HYaa	If she's as beautiful as you say she is chances are she's not that shy she probably just didn't want to go on a date with you and didn't want to hurt your feelings.|`|be1979ce40b9ceceab7ad137e21ac660aa	Why you tellin us all this. GO TELL HER.
4kIDqJCwaa	More like the combination of all those things. To me the biggest turn on is the personanlity then the looks (assuming she's my type). A girl who smiles and laughs with me is just a blast to be around.|`|2imXzBHbaa	how about when they show some interest in us and try to get to know us?|`|dhvaBwFzaa	everything you just wrote|`|EFGKxSsVaa	yeah, im gonna agree.<br>  its everything you just wrote, lol.|`|E4YlHCspaa	confidence and hygine|`|r4E2zXL8aa	Well, I guess their coochies. Like men really care about anything else besides that. Please.... ROFL!|`|W7l1awFPaa	The way they look at you which says, "Come here honey"|`|ufBNkOOTaa	Women are hot.<br>  <br>  All guys are different and like all of what you listed.  Curves, face, legs, stomachs, breast, and *** are great features on women as well.  You don't have to have all of them, but you can highlight what you got.    Personality wise I think every guy likes a girl that's funny, can crack jokes, and can still turn on the sexy when she has too.<br>  <br>  And of course the number one thing that makes men crazy about women is their vagina.  That thing right there, is powerful, its got like seductive powers on its own.  Not trying to be disgusting or anything, it is what it is.|`|unxgla59aa	I believe that for most men, its a down to earth personality. looks are important too because men are very visual, but after that its just a good personality. funny, cute, relaxed, and kind to others. the other things you listed just make them more attracted to you|`|kiY9kihbaa	Appearance/smell/dress is the initial draw.  After time personality is the single most important reason why men become crazy over a woman.  That's how you tell the difference between a fling and a relationship.|`|rIgqYmjYaa	To me what pulls me in is a good chase... however in the end I like happy results. Usually doesn't happen tho I've had an unlucky year|`|QY2Bqvifaa	it all depends on different outlooks but it's usually a combination of at least 3 or 4 of the reasons you stated.|`|h0ZdSxQiaa	smell and the way they dress first up and then personality.... how they handle themselves!!|`|q8ZEWy7Xaa	yea what u just wrote lol|`|eEL2iyzEaa	It tends to be some aspect of what you wrote. I think we'd agree that men love it when a girl can be herself around a guy, and that it's definitely better for a girl to be confident with herself rather than closed off from everything. I'd say everything else just depends on the guy and what he likes...|`|Qwd0dLVzaa	Deformity|`|UdOM5taDaa	Pheremones.  :)

Honesty and trust is what makes a relationship work.|`|tNTCZPBcaa	Well, i know wat ur going through, my bf and i were togather 6 months and then i moved from one coast to another. Its really hard, but we txt and talk as much as we can even though we're both really busy.<br>  Thats all there is to it, u just have to try as hard as you can and fight for what u want, just make sure ur not the only one to fight for it, if u think he's a player chances are ur rite. but talk 2 him feel him out, c wat he says.<br>  Good luck.|`|PUgIiHDYaa	What is your question?<br>  <br>  But anyways, it really depends on how commitmentive you guys are.

Qa6dFF4Eaa	here's my advice. don't break up with your boyfriend yet, get to know the other guy and see if there's something there, at the same time be more flirty with your boyfriend and see if there is still something there. if there is with the other guy and not your present boyfriend please don't play your boyfriend no one should do that, tell him the situation and move on. i mean you see him like once a week....get to know the other guy see if it will work, then make the decison to stay with your boyfriend or not<br>  hope that helped (:|`|5FY5SZjIaa	i have the same problem and im more like 18 hours from my bf and we broke up and i moved on twice and him once and we decided that it wasent right with the people we were with so we got back together and also get to know the guy and see if hes better then your bf if he is follow your heart if he isnt stay with your bf|`|uTl0W2hraa	well i have to ask does this other guy kno about ur bf <br>  <br>  if he doesnt kno about him <br>  ask him to hang out some time and see if her makes any moves towards you if he does, ull kno he interested in you<br>  it sounds like u should choose the new guy if u find him more interesting then ur old bf , only ask him out though if you find he is interested in you|`|BN162SIcaa	Sounds like you should leave your boyfriend either way. And if it works out with the new guy then it does, and if it doesn't then move on. You don't sound too hot for your current man anyway.|`|YYAmBsvXaa	well i've been through this..... i left my bf of 4 years for this guy i fell head over heels for. And we've been together a little over 2 years now. Take a chance.... you never know.|`|MSivx7roaa	if u don't like your bf as much than leave him<br>  <br>  even if the new guy doesn't work out....u would do the right thing|`|flUNllCEaa	i say u go away from this bf and meet this other guy|`|q8ZEWy7Xaa	ask the dude out and u can leave ur bf|`|WVeKHhwNaa	i was going out with this guy a long time ago, and i began to feel things for one of my friends who had just gotten out of a bad realtionship. so i broke up with my other bf for him, and now i am the happiest i have ever been in my life. you know what is right for you, so follow your gut.|`|6fe25b478729c3f71be4d3b0efbcbdb9aa	it kind of depends on a lot... like how long have you known this new guy, and there's obviously a reason you stayed with this other guy for three years. take some real time with your boyfriend and do something special, if you truly don't feel anything then you should break up whether there's another guy or not.|`|bS5s4Ai4aa	man i know exsactly how u feel im kinda in the same situation , its really hard to walk out when your not sure whats on the other side . if you know that your not happy with your man what would it hurt to see what other options you have . just be honest with both of them|`|Q64yv0POaa	first ask the guy if he likes you more than a friend then tell your boyfriend that you need to see him more than once a week and this relationship is just not working out then say i think we should see other ppl till we get thing figured out|`|fdvap8aIaa	I think you should follow your heart and go for who you truly love. Before you break up with your BF, ask the other guy if he likes you, then do what ever you need to next. : )|`|lXVqWV13aa	dump the chump and go 4 the gold j/k but really if you are having doubts about your bf then... should u be with him regardless|`|kZlmAybgaa	youve kind of aready answered your own question.  Your BF obviosly isnt doing it for you anymore.  The way you describe him the spark of your relationship has gone and that relationship was marked by bad chemistry anyway (you said you had problems with him in the past).  Not to mention he has moved away.  You need to do whats best for YOU.  This knew guy sounds exciting and fresh and if that is what you are looking for by all means dump the old bf and go with him.  Life is to short to waste on an ok long distance relationship when you could be having a great relationship with someone close by.  thats just my opinion though. Good luck.|`|NpSVEC2naa	well if your interested in another guy you should leave your man. no point in wasting your time on someone your not in love with. i wouldn't jump st8 into a new relationship tho, just be single for a while and see what doors open for you :)|`|UGQ6HObRaa	leave the guy, no doubt. Go after the new guy.|`|EFGKxSsVaa	after being together for so long, when you're that young, its time to move on. If your current boyfriend is neither fun, outgoing, or ambitious, you shouldn't be with that loser to begin with! lol<br>  plus he's moved, so it's a great excuse for you two to go your seperate ways and meet new people! ;)<br>  <br>  I'd dump the old boyfriend, <br>  and make a new one!<br>  <br>  good luck|`|8qiAcwSGaa	ask the guy if  he likes you more than a friend<br>  if he does <br>  ask him out<br>  <br>  leave ur bf|`|h8Q3CTOJaa	i think you should find out if this other guy likes you|`|uTQCKQQ9aa	Look into your relationship with your boyfriend is there anything there. Forget about the other boy and think only of the boyfriend and the relationship. Is there anything there Worth saving or are the feelings gone. Find that out and then go for the other guy if it's not meant for you and the b/f.  you are always going to find people in the world that you are attracted to that will never go away. But if you love the b/f find away to make it work it takes work if you love one another but if love is not there or you don't want to do the work then move on. but for yourself not because some dream boat came in to the picture.
ti1K0USpaa	No, you're not at all.  I think that you need to trust your gut on this.  It sounds like he's about to go off the deep end, so the more you can avoid him the better.  This might sound mean also, but being too nice with people that are a little whack is begging for problems.  You can ask me for the story later, but in the meantime I would strongly advise you to delete this guy from your facebook and stay away from him.|`|Kq1zpgU5aa	Tell him Nicely that your okay and if you ever need anything, you'll go straight to him.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  It Would Be Great If You Could Help Me Too...     <br>  :)<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090226175554AAIzRZL">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|Ebffvr2jaa	Tell him that you actually could not be happier! Your not a meanie! I would feel weird too!  Always let him know that contrary to his belief things are great! Good luck!|`|MzqZGvalaa	You know what sweetie always trust your instincts.  Something is telling you not to trust this bloke.  In my experience when I've ignored my instincts I've lived to regret it.  How do you know he was locked up for something he didn't do, I mean how do you know he didn't do it?  Eight years is a long time to give a juvie, there must have been a case at least, or why'd he get 8 years?  Now I know the justice system makes mistakes all the time, but try this, (well you can't try it but imagine this) stand in the common room of any jail anywhere in the world, ask them who didn't do it, see all those hands, some of them are lying!   Listen to your instincts always!|`|kRbkiPvnaa	Follow your gut feelings on things like this. You can't make yourself like someone if you don't.  You are not being mean so don't worry about it.

Its one of the two though, hope this helped.|`|7AndmAg4aa	he likes you or thinks your pretty etc... it sounds like he is interested but hes too shy to do something about it. good luck.|`|ea073069c581a3e342f2f7ec101708f1aa	Well they are trying to get your attention pretty much.

Shane was probably a little put off by the fact you did'nt come out and talk to him yourself, you used a mutual friend to do it for you.  Are you worried?  All he can say is yes or no to a date, if he says no find someone else.  Your in High School, you've got a lot of time left in your life.|`|Q64yv0POaa	omg this is like my situation i think he likes you but he just doesn't want to admit it to you or any of your friends because he thinks it would ruin his vibe but girl he is like totally in love with you <br>  <br>  my situation is like he will watch me through out lunch and if i am in there he wont leave it so wierd because i am a freshman and he is a senior<br>  <br>  he likes you i just know it|`|LoLeNGYwaa	Okay separate your self from the group for a little while and he wont be so freakin scared to walk up to you   I mean seriosly if he has to have a freakin onturash to walk up to your group of friends hes scared out of his freakin mind but still likes you <br>  Thats what guys absolutly hate when asking out a girl 20 other girls standing around you <br>  If you women learned to stand more than 6 inches apart half of you woudnt be single|`|4zY5xSKyaa	If he is looking at you all the time and him and his friends seem to be intentionally hanging out right next to you, then he probably wants you to talk to him, maybe try smiling at him, that will make him comfortable approaching you if you dont want to try approaching him|`|f094646fcdd1623bfd2fff49a207408daa	he is going to try to get in your pants!!!  trust me. i have done the same thing with my frieds in the past. he knows you like/liked him and he is gonna play on that to get in your pants so he can brag to all those guys you see with. ignor him no matter how hard he comes after you, it's just another game!|`|cWMdoLZ5aa	Either he's trying to get you to notice him or he's somewhat interested that your interested in him?

1Z0Lmrk1aa	Yes I would try al anon and go from there. Good luck.
zkHwRCm3aa	ok. this is what you do. <br>  1. Go buy a brand spanking new test at the store.<br>  2. Meet up with her, and demand she take the tst right there right then<br>  3. if it is negetive tell her to F off.<br>  4. If it is positive, ask her how it could be yours, when you had a one night stand...keeping in mind if she had one with you, she coulda had one with anybody. I would tell the ****** to contact you with the paternity test papers, because there is no way you are getting trapped into something you don't want.<br>  those are the dangers of a raw F*ck. diseases and little children.<br>  or worse yet, little children with diseases.<br>  Don't you feel bad about cheating on your girl with some random skank, with no condom? you should be more responsible, young'n.<br>  I know I probably sound mean, but it's true.|`|441GSyaMaa	Maybe you shouldn't have slept with her if there was a risk of pregnancy.

Don't run, just text her back, "Might is not a positive word. Take a test, if it comes out positive wait for your period. How do you even know this baby is mine? For all I know you could be a slut."

She is trying to trap you. Unless what she said was real and that she truly was pregnant...in that case you'd have to step up to the consequences.|`|cZeAG3sLaa	She's probably trying to trap you, but then again she might just want to talk since by your account she seemed pretty desperate to see you...I think you should talk to her face to face and clear things out.|`|RFTzEc5Jaa	si, amigo. tell her wat u plan 2 do nd ask her if she's sure. if she's giving u unstraight answers, then just dint pay attention. see later if something is going on nd be around her frnds cuz if sumthng happens 2 her, they'll know and possibly gossip (u know us grlz). just dont pay attention 2 her|`|xG7sujZyaa	forget it shes just trying to scare you if she really is pregnant she will get the court involved....|`|s564PQUHaa	dude not to be a dick but that's a stupid question. hahaha. no s#it he's trying to trap you. <br>  <br>  question is is she hot.<br>  <br>  if she is. how did you get a one night stand.|`|G6KNZIVTaa	this girl sounds like a real stalker you should totally keep away dude<br>  but if she really is pregnant you should support her but tell her you'd be better off as friends|`|NkmRiYqfaa	well she might be pregnant. somepeople still go out and drink beer when they are. just make her take a pregnancy test. and if its negative than leave her alone|`|oA5VhGYVaa	yessss!! Run brother, run!!!|`|of3Fbb0jaa	if she is abortion no big deal!!!!|`|9x0pLKnvaa	Okay look sometimes women might think they are pregnant because they are late on their periods and when they try to take a pregnancy test it will be too early to tell. This happened to me! My period was late for one whole month I kept taking pregnancy test after pregnancy test and they all came out negative then once the whole month was over I took another test and it was positive! This could be happening to her too!<br>  But most likely she is trying to trap you because she would have went over to your house crying and scared! So tell her you want to see the PT before she starts with that!|`|tO25n02Iaa	Ok first of all you shouldn't have even messed with her and if you didn't want her to text you, you shouldn't have gave her your number. But anyway some girls that really want someone they will do anything to get it so in your situation, yes she is most likely trying to trap you with pretending shes pregnant. If you don't want her in your life anymore, change your number and don't talk to her anymore and if you do then tell her the truth about how you don't like her lying to you and anything else that way she will know how you feel about her and the situation then she will most likely leave you alone. The best way to stop another situation like this one is to stop fornicating and give you life to God!!!!!
Ag8pE3Cyaa	I fall in the category of beautiful women. Believe it or not I have the hardest time to find a date. Thing is I also have a career and I'm financially independent with no small children. It's a curse believe me. I've been dumped by men with the following excuses: I'm too rational, I think too much like a man, I'm strong woman I can't possibly understand their pain and trails. <br>  <br>  When I travel back and forth to work I see women with no femininity, no care for their appearance, their face, their hair and they have a man next to them. <br>  <br>  It's a puzzle. <br>  <br>  (I was married in the past)<br>  <br>  I've seen beautiful women dating ugly men. They had not discovered yet how beautiful they were so she was not acting in a threatening way. A beautiful women who knows she is beautiful is a much bigger treat in the eyes men.<br>  <br>  ADD: Beautiful or not, it's easier to be married period. Like you said I have to handle everything on my own. I have to take important decisions on my own without the support or the advice of a mate. When times get tough, I have to keep myself positive, on my own. When I'm sick, or like last fall when I broke a leg, I had to deal with that on my own.|`|qfVE2KFtaa	A attractive women can have any men she wants and as far as some men having attractive wife's being uncomfortable, hey when you go in the bedroom you should wear your hard hat and take your lunch box and go to work.|`|lyWSufFBaa	LOL well beauty is in the eye of the beholder.  What may be an unattractive married woman to you may be a gorgeous being to the husband.  If a man is intimidated by having a beautiful wife that just means he's insecure.

My husband and i are very happy together it will be 30 years this May that we been married. My husband was 18 when we met and he had many pretty girls after him he like pretty girls nothing wrong with that most men wants to date pretty women. If you had to choose between unattractive and attractive who would you choose ?|`|c22d1dc064023005c5689f01beb26088aa	all women r beautiful,like flowers; its not in its fragrance or yew that its beauty lies,a flower is only emblematic of nature,spring,and life.its in its significance that its beauty lies. even the ambitious violet yearning to become a rose. beauty is intangible and must be perceived in order to be appreciated.it test the nobility of men and becomes distorted w/time,(superficial), like flowers remain so forever. beauty  is the eminent essence which manifest itself in good,purity,love,and thought. contentment and stress r denouments of valid or invalid reasoning. not beauty. enjoy.|`|bO2rzfISaa	What are you trying to say? Stress levels are not associated with beauty. Happiness is a choice made from within. This is one of the weirdest questions I've ever read.|`|HL8PEDFLaa	It really depends. If you're good looking but can't find a man to marry, you would be miserable. If you are unattractive but in a good marriage you may or may not be happy. A single woman who is responsible doesn't mean that she is stressed because she has to do it alone. Of course it might be easier in some respects, but when I was single I loved doing things on my own. It's great to feel competent. Of course there are definitely perks to being married though. This question can't really be answered because there are too many variables.|`|a0b1f8c0a89f6e9a6fb1048bcf570db3aa	I think those two women based upon the hypothetical criteria given are equally content. The pretty woman with no man is just as cool as the homely chick with a man coming home to her every night. Actually, maybe the married woman is happier but maybe the single woman is divorced and now free of a whole lot of bullish. Hmm... I don't think it was a bad question, it made me think a little.|`|mgwiuZT0aa	Most people feel sorry for the ugly women when they need to feel sorry for the attractive women. Most men marry ugly women because they are intimidated and they usually end up cheating on their wives with an attractive woman. <br>  <br>  Most men that are married to attractive woman end up cheating on their wives with an ugly woman. It's a no win situation either way.|`|tY4hOjqdaa	Since the unattractive  one is alleged to be content in her marriage and the pretty one has nobody, then yes the pretty one would not be happy. She has nobody. Lets face it, those who say they are fine single could be happier if they had the right match for them.|`|zHX9tlnWaa	It's pretty sad if anyone allows how they look to effect how happy they are. It's also sad if a woman's happiness is based on whether or not she is with a man. It's hard to ever be content if you only focus on things you have no control over.|`|YzObEmUqaa	I'll take the attractive unmarried woman<br>  at least, she won't bring me headaches|`|p6QizgmRaa	As long as one is happy with themselves, it doesn't matter if they have a partner or not... are attractive or not. I'm not married and am very happy with my life.|`|J7Mmo5Xmaa	Depends on the person hon.<br>  Some women get lonely and hate single life.Some women and men are happy alone.<br>  I have seen attractive women in happy marriages and ugly ones in happy marriages.<br>  I have seen both in unhappy marriages.<br>  If a guy loves and trusts his wife, it is because she gives him no reason to mistrust her,she doesn't do things to make him feel insecure or doubt her and she makes him feel loved and wanted.<br>  If she isn't going to do this, then he will look elsewhere.<br>  The hollywood trailer park trash you listed is a warning sign to any man with a brain hon.Most guys would have sex with them, but marry them?LOL get real.These women may be attractive, the problem is they know it and try to use it to enslave a guy,most of them are selfish and self centered, sexually loose and immoral and a guy who is looking to get married does not want a woman like that no matter how she looks.Why do you think the divorce rate is so high among celebrities?<br>  There are beautiful women who are decent people.Again, it is about the quality of person they are and how the men  perceive them.|`|6LKEWFPoaa	This question is really stupid. Everyone does not have the same impression of who is attractive and who is not. I (as well as others) think that I am gorgeous. I have been all my life, there were times that I was happy alone and there were times when I was happy with someone, as well as unhappy with someone and unhappy alone. My looks have nothing to do with any of that.<br>  <br>  Men expect a lot, but if you can't hold a candle stick to Brad Pitt, then you shouldn't be expecting Angelina.|`|Jly7xMU6aa	I feel as though beauty is more than skin deep. To me I believe it who u are on the inside that matters.  No offense but Lets take Gabriel Union for example; beautiful woman but my sister just told me how no one in the entertainment industry doesn't seem to want to date her. So in a way looks may be deceiving because from my stand point I'd say who wouldn't want to date her.  But what a person portrays in public may not be who they really are when the camera shuts off|`|xO9HeDWCaa	I'm female and not gay and I am married. I think Whoopi rocks! She is warm and funny and quit-witted. I am sure many men would prefer Whoopi or any other woman with a good sense of humor to any woman who thinks she is "God's gift to men!"  Some single women are happy, some are not. Some married women are happy, some are not. It just depends. Beauty does not make one happy. Beauty is sometimes "high maintenance!" Is that what you want? You may be paying for it if that is what you are after. You were asking about the stress level of married and unmarried women, of beautiful and unnatractive women. I am not sure what one's looks or marital status has to do with stress level and being happy???
POFdWpUzaa	Sit down, and write your mom a letter telling her what you just told us. Don't mention the part of walking in your shoes. Have you tried to walk in her shoes? Your mom has issues and conflicts and problems that you don't even know about. She has a lot to deal with and raising a daughter is not the easiest thing in this world today. Being part of a family means you try to understand your family members and respect them. You do that by engaging them in your life and becoming engaged in their lives. Showing them respect will earn you respect over time. You are still very young, but if you begin interacting more positively with  your mom, giving into her wishes, you will see what changes come about in her attitude toward you. Don't fight her, don't rebel against her wishes for you...try to be positive and responsible and respectful and fun to be around. Talk to her, love her, laugh with her, make her laugh. She is your world right now and she can make yours miserable if you choose to defy her. <br>  <br>  Work WITH the authorities in your life and they will make your life better, trust me on this one. Love and peace.|`|W1lqSWR7aa	Try being yourself don't let her bug you let everything she says go over your head.If you get mad at her just go somewhere where no one can hear you a yell out just let it all out.|`|XA27FyS8aa	OMG!!!!... im sorry if you get offended by this but your moms a phyco  path if she ddoesn'tlet you have fun!!! You should ask her to sit down with you without anyone else listening and you say "Mom, i ddon'tlike to argue with you, i don't like it when you criticize me, i am not wrong all the time, and i do thank god for a lot of things, listen i love you and we need to have a better relationship together or we are going to be fighting till we are old and wrinkly. I love you mom." <br>  <br>  Hope it works out!!! :) ?
5wfIHHGTaa	well i can tell you this from experience. My Fiance is almost 33, and i am almost 24. We are getting married in March, but have been dating for over 6yrs. I have known him for like 16 yrs. I dont think its an "age" issue, i just think men are ready when they are ready..dont push them, cuz lord knows, that makes them NOT want to get married. I mean my man and I dated 6yrs before he even asked me. Honestly, i didnt think he was ever going to ask because he always said "i think of you as my wife now". I was worried for a while...but then one day BAM he just popped the question. I think men are programmed to think ALOT differently than women. We are born to think about planning a wedding, having kids etc. Guys just think from one minute to the next, lol! But no, i dont think it has anything to do with the age. MOST men that age are thinking about settling down because they know they arent getting younger, but in my case, he told me because of the age difference, he wanted to make sure i was ready! :)|`|KqQlWbYsaa	Frankly, I think just about everyone these days is a bit cautious; and I don't think 30 plus men are necessarily more selective than their younger counterparts.  In fact, both males and females are marrying later and later, putting marriage on hold to pursue careers and such.<br>  <br>  Certainly, there are exceptions to the above; and that is to a degree reflected in reality television as well as in terms of those who flock to Vegas and the like to elope.<br>  <br>  By the way, why limit your question to females?:  Don't you think 30 plus males seeking males as spouses would be just as choosy?|`|crxbob5jaa	When a man is ready to marry, he starts trying to find a woman who he enjoys being with. Same as a younger guy. <br>  <br>  I don't think its as much a "more" or less cautious situation as much as it is a time issue with 30+ men.|`|52e1044b00e7fe6ffc7e96609443787daa	I think they're less cautious. They have more choices and they realize they aren't getting any younger.|`|gCy9tirPaa	i would say some 30+ men are more cautious, especially those who have had 'serious' relationships for more than 6years, let's say. I advise don't push him into it. Talk openly about it, but don't think that life will suddenly get better just because you tie the knot! Enjoy life as it comes... :)|`|PDcnXgE6aa	I think they can be cautious at age upto 28 only after that some frustration resides over their mind......and they want to marry as soon as possible so ...........they need to less cautious|`|TXaMOQo6aa	idk but have you seen movies? old men or whatever, never give a care. if the girl's hot, then they just go after her =p|`|4POGapREaa	My husband & I were both in our late 30's when we met.  I think he clearly knew what he wanted & so did I.  It totally depends on the person ultimately but when you've been around the block & know what you DON'T want, you're more likely to dismiss people quicker & move on if it's not working.  My husband & I both had several long term relationships before meeting each other that proved to be nothing but a waste of time & I think it's just something you don't want to repeat again.  So yeah, you live & you learn.|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	Not always, Men really don't reach maturity until late 30s, if that. Some men really are still immature horny jerks at 30.
RgymoiIQaa	OK, you need to read what you just wrote to yourself. There are only a couple of choices here. You need to get over it and really get over it. Don't hide it and say you are ok with it. Or you need to move on. The bad thing is that you I'm sure knew about all of this at the beginning and went ahead with it anyway. Things like that bother me too. So, I look for men who don't keep a lot of females around. Not that I am insecure- but I don't trust other females. I have seen the shady ones in action. You need to seriously think about all if this before you marry him. Because they aren't going anywhere, and your feelings about it may not either which will cause huge issues later on if it hasn't already.|`|7ciDto6Daa	Well you could just have a chat with him, & explain how you feel.<br>  & also perhaps all his close female friends say I love you to him because they just like being his friend. I say ily to all my friends regardless in their in a relationship.|`|vZyhHabzaa	You should definintely tell him about this! Those women are crossing the line with all the hearts and "I love yous." They need to be more mature and stop hitting on a taken man. I'm sure he'll understand if you just tell him everything you're feeling.|`|wuZXqYPGaa	well maybe if you stick him in ur shoes.. if he thinks bout you havin many guys friends how would he feel? prob the same... i mean to me its not THAT BIG OF A DEAL especially if hes ur fiance and thats ur littlest problem, but then again if its buggin you get it resolved :)|`|bdSm8Mi6aa	I think you are absolutely right and justified by your worries. I think once there is a ring on the finger friendships with straight people of the opposite sex needs to stop.  It's totally inappropriate.  I always say, follow your gut instincts.<br>  <br>  Now I personally DON'T think your fiance is cheating on you or anything with those girls, but with all the stress and ups and downs of a relationship it could be a little risky.  Also, I've seen a couple break up from this.<br>  <br>  <br>  At the office where I worked one of my co-workers, Dave*, was living with his girlfriend of 3 yrs Julia (they were pretty much on there way to marriage).  Dave and a colleague Lisa were best friends, they went to lunch together and joked around and even went out to happy hour once in awhile.  Julia even had Lisa over at the apt a couple of times for movie nights, and they went shopping together and Julia was totally trusting of Lisa & Dave's friendship.  Fast forward to 6 months later and guess who Dave's now dating--his "friend"<br>  <br>  I think u should also ask ur fiance if he'd like it if you had male friends calling you this much.|`|brkvK1Teaa	You should reevaluate your engagement.  Do you want your fiancee to give up all his female friends?  Have you given up your male friends?  Imagine if in the future he makes new female friends.  It's always going to be a problem.  Maybe you need to find a man with no female friends to begin with.  You know it's always going to make you angry and cause problems with your marriage.  Unless you want to be with someone who lives in a cave, you have to accept the fact that we humans are social creatures.  If he didn't like having female friends, he would not be with you right now.  After all you're a female too.  Good luck.|`|zeV5cCalaa	trust well does he do the same thing like leave hearts and tell em that he loves them<br>  <br>  do you talk to his good "girl" friends<br>  but one thing if his friends were their for him<br>  before you came along then ofcourse he will say tha he doenst understand and all that bs . just chill. and talk it over be the woman<br>  in the relationship|`|O8BoOvuwaa	Ohh god, don't be like that. I say "I love you<3" to all of my friends, regardless of weather there in a relationship or not . <br>  It just means I'm glad to be your friend and I care about you . <br>  There his friends, of course they love him ! But not necessarily like that|`|9x0pLKnvaa	Effff That girl you should know better don't let him <br>  start that mess "It's just a family friend" How do you think he would feel if you had a "family friend" calling you at those wee-hours at night!<br>  Girl play his game too! See if he is going to like it!|`|KtCdVaz9aa	I know exactly how you feel. That feeling didn't go away until I talked him about it. So basically you need to talk to him about it regardless if he gets offended or not.|`|x1FzJLwZaa	talk to him about it but you know there is a reason why you are his fiance and they are all JUST his close female friends. stop being jealous, it might freak him out. why not be friends with his friends..|`|9IanzxZ7aa	I would just tell him! Simple as that.|`|y9icmRcYaa	UGH! This is a tough one. My ex husband had all close female friends. I took everyone's advice and befriended the women, keep your friends close and your enemies closer but, what irritates me the most about it is now that we are divorced he is dating one of those women he said was just a close friend. It makes me wonder how long those feelings were there etc... <br>     It's easy to say, you just have to trust him and be ok with it but, I have been there and it's just not that easy. Have a serious talk with him about your insecurities and tell him it's not getting better and you don't want it to turn into resentment, because it will. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|Q64yv0POaa	just talk to him about it he will understand trust me|`|eEL2iyzEaa	Alright, I've had this problem before, except I was on the side of your fiance. Most of my friends are girls, and we're all very close. So the "I love you"s and hearts are typical of us.<br>  But there have been those select girls whom I've dated that have had a problem with this. They held it in and after a while I noticed that something was bothering them. When they explained everything and what bothered them about specific people, sure I was a little offended with the fact that they didn't trust me when they supposedly new me, but I just explained that they were my friends and I had no interest in them other than as a friend. Usually she'd cool off and stop worrying so much.<br>  <br>  It's not too much to worry about. Just tell him about it, and explain why it bothers you.|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	You need to not react to whoever his friends are if they are family friends. The love and hearts stuff is another matter and that you need to ask him to tell them to please omit the love and hearts, that is inappropriate to send to someone who is engaged.
L5tWiYOFaa	This is why we have so many obese teenagers.|`|441GSyaMaa	I still live at home, I'm nearly 20, and my mum I swear, now she's getting older (not old, but in her 50's) she just keeps saying comments like "do you want anything to eat?", "there's stuff in the freezer", "want me to do anything for you?" - then repeats every 5 minutes :-P<br>  <br>  Crazy, can't live without your mother|`|7511595fc4d3e31538e8df239de8a7c5aa	hahahhahahahah   yep, it's true!!!|`|tVPyRHEJaa	it is funny but mother's gave birth to their kids and all their life mothers look after their children. it is always in the nature of a mother|`|X2eVfKc6aa	I think everybody has a mother or nan like that =]|`|Y5WJWnvbaa	my mum doesn't tend to do this. as the only vegetarian under the roof, it's hassle!<br>  <br>  but my grandad always cooks me a chickpea curry (y)
vJeAEncYaa	It can be one of three things she is either really busy and having a hard time ballancing things, she really likes you and has commitment issues and is being hesitant cuz she doesnt want to get hurt or she is losing intrest. As a girl when I dont like someone and they want to hang out I always come up with some excuss why I cant see them and dont always respond to there messages and Ive also been known to self sabotage relationships cuz im scared to get hurt, So if you really like her my advice is to ask her point blank do you want this to continue and see eachother or do you want to see other peps, Maybe she doesnt want to rush things or see multi peps Good Luck|`|9x0pLKnvaa	Okay first off you are being to clingy! She is into you other wise <br>  she would ignore you totally! Believe me!<br>  If you really want to see for yourself stop calling/texting her so much and see if she comes around.|`|TGQhJQQhaa	Ok your lucky you know her friend..<br>  <br>  ask her friend about her and tell her friend to help you out and ull get her back

xO9HeDWCaa	I surely don't mean to scare you, but there's a chance these guys are stalking you or other girls in the area. It is no laughing matter and do take this seriously. I would report it to the police and try to give good descriptions of the car and the men, if you can. Tell your parents or guardians, for sure. Don't go out alone, at least for a while. Always have somebody with you, preferably someone older. NEVER get in the car and fight like h*** if they grab you. You won't survive if they get you in the car - you won't return! You must believe that. If you got back into the store, you should have told the store clerk or manager. Don't feel foolish in doing this. You may save your own life and some other girls.|`|s9zC9r9Uaa	you did really well. exactly what I would have done anways.<br>  <br>  You should invest in some pepper spray just in case.|`|82Esp6v1aa	i carry a knife on me so if any nukkas wanna screw around with me they will have a blade in their stomach, carry a weapon is your best bet im getting a concealed firearm permit in a few weeks and will be carrying a .45 if thats legal haha<br>  <br>  my mom was being followed in a parking lot, on foot and the guy was like 4 feet behind her and he kept asking if she needed any help, she kept saying no but he kept asking. she stabbed him in the eye with her car keys, she said he didnt say much after that.|`|GvSE01Tmaa	i think you did a good thing by running to a friend<br>  that happened to me before, twice i was walking to the gas station and was being followed by a truck so i called my mom to pick me up there :]<br>  and another time when i was with a girl, a car followed us so we ran into my neighbors yard|`|dVFsejjJaa	Run to the nearest public place and if he follows you there, tell an older adult (ages 30-50 is your best bet) that you don't know this man and he's asking you for private information.<br>  <br>  Or, you could make up ****<br>  ex: Whats your name?<br>  -Ugangle.<br>  <br>  Uh... okay?

76nTvO4iaa	I live in the US.  Engagement parties are traditionally not gift giving occasions here.|`|RA3p25Qoaa	here it's usually: Cards with restaurant or house wears store gift certificates, bottle of wine, wedding themed books, or a serving dish of some kind.

But you are most definitely not obligated.<br>  <br>  At my boyfriend's brother's engagement party last year, several gifts were given and we gave a gift. But our family is one of those get-together-all-the-time families that always find excuses throw a gift-giving party.|`|LAXbJfvwaa	I know the others have said not to bring a gift - however at our engagement party we specifically asked for NO gifts - and most people brought them.  It was kind of bad - cause those who didn't bring gifts felt like they should have - even though we asked them not to.  So I would probably bring at least a small gift.  Something simple like a nice salt and pepper shaker or bath towels or even a nice vase would be good.  If you don't know them extremely well then play it safe and don't choose anything too expensive or too crafty.|`|AW1dCzH0aa	According to the Emily Post wedding etiquette book, presents are not expected at the engagement party, but typically family and close friends do bring gifts.  We had an engagement party and we definitely received gifts.  Everything was off of our registry.  I've only been to one other engagement party and I took a gift.  I didn't spend as much on it as I did the bridal shower or wedding gifts, but I didn't want to show up empty handed.|`|7CKipTZOaa	Maybe buy the future bride and groom a drink, you can do a bottle of wine but gifts are not necessary|`|vCZuh3oDaa	Nothing.  An engagement party is not a party where one brings gifts.<br>  <br>  A card expressing your well wishes is the proper response to news of an engagement, but if you are actually attending the engagement party yourself, surely you can deliver your well wishes in person.<br>  <br>  Have fun!
oENe16luaa	The third nipple wouldn't bother me.  I have 4 myself. Bad in the sack is a deal breaker though.|`|BUpcsIGfaa	depends how far you are into the relationship, if its not far, i suggest start again with someone else you wanna be happy in the bedroom, in life, and not feel like you have to not look at the third nipple, im guessing you can't help it i wouldnt be able to lol.<br>  <br>  good luck :-)|`|Ah9nRiidaa	Honestly...yeah I really would break up with a guy but it just depends on weather you are comfortable with it or not....<br>  Smelling like chicken with a third nipple and he's not good in bed....Wheres your pleasure?!?! <br>  <br>  -Good luck|`|vKYdV5r2aa	NAW i'd stay with him ,but i like chicken|`|E7TkNO00aa	Yes, that would make me uncomfortable to even look at him.

aDL7xmt6aa	no|`|SsfnitjXaa	Your feelings remained strong over the course of 20 years because you were not together 24/7.  No you don't meet and matter of fact you should stop communicating all together and put that time toward your own families.|`|qfVE2KFtaa	Let's be honest you're meeting to have sex and you don't want to feel guilty about it,but it's a booty call plain and simple|`|KqQlWbYsaa	I think you are swamped in some kind of fantasy or obsession regarding this male.  I strongly advise against the two of you meeting in the unrealistic hopes of rekindling a spark; and, by the way, married individuals who play with "fire" are bound to get burned.|`|YzObEmUqaa	Yes<br>  If you like him<br>  <br>  OOps! didn't read your Q<br>  <br>  So, no it isn't a good idea.|`|c1qLIB4Eaa	Dear Rosewater,<br>  <br>  Why do you not want to meet with him? you should definitively. <br>  <br>  Let me explain you if you keep away from him the attraction will increase and moreover you will always repent that why you did not met when he wan in your town.<br>  <br>  Beside I would suggest to meet in the presence of your spouse so that you will be in control and try to spent as much time as you can so that the law of attraction will work and you will never take so seriously when next time he will be in town. I mean you will go and meet him naturally.<br>  <br>  Its a golden chance to meet him after 2 decades and dont miss this opportunity. <br>  <br>  All the best and God Bless.
ea63ee6b84bdba1f522e6a039e51ad4eaa	She is soo Flirting with you. You seem like you like her. Maybe you should ask her out to someplace.  Ask her out to like Coffee or maybe to get an ice cream. You guys should soo go out|`|oPomvXgJaa	It definitely sounds like she likes you. And it also kinda sounds you like her a little too! And it doesn't sound bad that you just wanna hold her close...that sounds extremely sweet. Ask her out! Maybe for coffee? Just see where it goes from there...|`|F5BeUzDLaa	Duuuuude, thats the sign that she wants you..<br>  if she giggles alot at other guy's too, then shes just a natural giggler.. but if she giggles at you the most then i have 4 words for you: Ask. her. out.|`|3VHcLg4Paa	ask her yourself....|`|VALxlwYSaa	What's the question? <br>  <br>  You should ask her out :P|`|06Rlukp7aa	She is definitly flirting with you. Ask her if she wants to get ice cream or something some time and take it slowly from there. Good luck.
F5BeUzDLaa	Sounds like he's shy<br>  or just obsessed..<br>  try starting convo with him if he stares at you<br>  if he doesn't say anything back when you say hi, I'd that's a sign of obsession..

MfrVriHJaa	I like the second one better. It looks fancier. The first one is pretty too though.|`|FMjsTCWTaa	Box #2 has too much going on for my taste, like the wax seal and the tag together.  Box #1 is pretty and elegant and simple.  I love it!  Very classy.|`|ioNKVW9haa	Definitely the bottom one!<br>  <br>  But remember that it's about YOU and your FIANCE!  So it doesn't really matter what I think as long as YOU like the final decision.|`|BnOrf9nGaa	Box 2.   Congrats on your wedding.|`|q3ulEHYAaa	I like box 2 a lot better|`|RRqXXG2Taa	2|`|8C4eDazGaa	i like the secon one /c u can see it form above and when u stand u cant see the bow... but i do LOVE LOVE LOEV both...|`|NvW6voPJaa	Ohhh...I definitely like #2 better....even if it takes a bit longer.

I think the second one is the best and more exciting.|`|cd8f30c22031713366cdb6b1bfaa4f5faa	i like the second one. Actually it must depend on your theme of your wedding and your wedding colours.|`|AA10768706	definitely number 2. and congratulations and good luck!|`|qKbwBYRTaa	Box Two is beautiful and fancy.

JhvqUvlsaa	Keep being there for your guy friends and maybe one day one will start to notice you more as a friend and if you feel the same way, you're all set. You kinda have to let relationships happen. =)|`|aMHjKGU3aa	how old r u? don't date till your 18 because at 13-16 guys only want one thing.......... $ex
jPJ9MTCwaa	Really it could be any range of costs.  A lot of people I know have had BBQs or smaller catered events at their home.  This is more causal and often costs much less than if you rent out a banquet room at a nice restaurant or the likes.  Personally, my fiance and I are looking at about $1,300-1,500 for 33 people for our rehearsal dinner which includes open bar, salad, dinner, and dessert in an outside, private patio area.|`|KqQlWbYsaa	Well, traditionally, the rehearsal dinner is either held at the location for the actual wedding reception or at a local restaurant or hotel (i.e., in a catering/banquet room for the latter).  As for the cost, traditionally the ones hosting the wedding and/or paying for the same, pick up the tab; and, frankly, I cannot in my mind justify spending anything above $30.00 per person for the rehearsal dinner (and, by the way, that does not include anything as to booze for the rehearsal "practice" toasts).|`|crxbob5jaa	People have rehearsal dinner all over the place. I've known friends to have picnics and cook out in backyards on the grill. I've had friends have rehearsal dinners in the church hall, both catered and home cooking. Then there are restaurants and country clubs. <br>  <br>  The choices are only limited by your creativity. And there is no average cost per person. You figure out what you can afford with your budget, then see what you need to spend per person and find a menu that goes with your budget. It's time consuming, but the only way to figure it out. I wish you the best!|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	It depends on the food you are serving, who is catering,where are you eating at, how many people are going to be there.<br>  <br>  If anything, it's $20.00 per person.|`|093adb8ec6136150f94ebe4b7a62899eaa	Price per person usually depends on the restaurant you have the event at. My daughter has decided to have an outdoor dinner in Mom and Dads backyard. We are going to open the hot tub, and rent a tent, get a little bit of beer, and have a bbq. <br>  Much cheaper than taking 25 or 30 people out at the tune of 14 or 20 bucks each.|`|76nTvO4iaa	It depends what you want.<br>  <br>  I've been to rehearsal dinners at:<br>  <br>  1.  A Pizza place  <br>  2.  A local diner<br>  3.  A cafeteria<br>  4.  A fancy restaurant<br>  5.  A hamburger joint<br>  6.  The groom's parent's back yard<br>  7.  The parish hall at the church<br>  8.  You get the idea - there is no rule for where to have it!|`|2eoAqicdaa	<a href="http://weddings.about.com/od/showersandparties/a/RehearsalDinner.htm" rel="nofollow">http://weddings.about.com/od/showersandp...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  i hope this helps x
Vp4RFKwjaa	a reason why a mayor would say eliminating a sport or extracurricular activity is wack, is that sports and extra activitys keep a lot of kids out of trouble...also keeps a lot of kids in shape! They are def something a school should never get rid of!
1e66262e2ef399091d3ff08f8c8d60c0aa	be nice, talk sweet ,and if she still is doing the other guy, just move on, its the best thing for the both of you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
GomB6c83aa	hes attracted to you but too shy to do anything about it. same thing happened to me then i realized its dumb that im even wondering if he is into me because if he wasnt i wouldnt catch him looking at me. so really you dont need to look to deep into it because its right there in front of you that he is into you so maybe you could lighten the mood and go up to him in your class or something|`|NIlDPtNeaa	Possibly.<br>  He might be facinated about your looks/friends/personality though,<br>  So dont go jumping into conclusions.|`|3fD3ldUQaa	Well he mite like u, but he also mite think ure wierd.dont take it the wrong way though, im not calling u wierd its just...well idk?????|`|wp3vYFB9aa	i think so.. since he always stares.. though im not sure why he wouldnt smile. maybe u dont see him smile b/c he stops when u turn his way|`|qlhDCAPyaa	he likes u
VEEgoDkFaa	It was a bit insensitive on your part, but you were being honest.  It's just that she's really going through it right now and she was looking for comfort, not brutal honesty. Oh well, she'll just have to get over it. Trust. ';-)|`|cHM2US6xaa	She is being too sensitive..<br>  <br>  I woulda laughed and just kept talking about it.|`|JGDwmFscaa	No i don't think it was insensitive, like you said it would have made me laugh, unless he really was gay? Was he really gay? Do you know, because i would be crying my eyes out if he was gay, it would make me feel less of a woman, so the comment "I always thought he was gay anyways" was not insensitive or offensive because it was a comment given with the best of intentions, she was just upset because maybe he is gay and like my sister said (and maybe you can try this) "he'd had to be gay in order to give you up" but don't feel bad about being truthful, she will get over it.|`|x1FzJLwZaa	it really depends on the person whether to feel if its insensitive or offensive. if you are her friend, you should have known better|`|alAtUXvyaa	she's being too sensitive, you were trying to cheer her up and you were telling the truth.|`|s564PQUHaa	she's too sensitive and still loves him. <br>  <br>  still say that gay thing cuz it's funny. don't change that routine|`|Omqwye5uaa	If my friend said that I would definitely lmao.... But if your friend was starting to think that the reason her boyfriend left here was gay, it may have really offended her.<br>  <br>  the best thing to do is just apologize and explain you here trying to cheer her up.|`|dhFeoqJYaa	it was half and half... she thought you were making a joke of something that mattered to her and she was a little sensitive too. she could have just said "that's insensitive" or something like that|`|ODfbBKg5aa	she's too sensitive. thats great of you to say. I say that to MY friends when they get dumped. I would've laughed the sadness off.|`|z7tkgAPSaa	dont worry things like that girls will get over really soon i wouldn't even worry about it i have said stuff like that before and it didn't really matter|`|sTDL7aiKaa	maybe she took it as an inappropriate joke, so it seemed like you were making jokes about something that mattered to her.|`|CGlDAvkAaa	She's way too sensitive|`|sNJ7uHPMaa	haha i would have laughed at what you said but im pretty laid back. but kudos to you bud haha
vswjlUvWaa	be nice. give compliments(but not perverted ones). tell jokes. get to know her. then ask her out. she probably will say yes.|`|LMITClMnaa	you should make plans to the movies with ur friends then invite her but say she can bring some of her friends too if she wants cuz i dotn think she would feel comfortable begin at the movies with all these guys that i dont think she noes well.|`|RAHl0eQ3aa	just be really nice to one or hold their books to class.  you could start a conversation to some girl.|`|6uhnyEYEaa	ha i m in middle school and all and just ask sum1 to the movies and they should say yes. good luk!|`|zGZe0mt8aa	you mean in  middle school ?<br>  i would advice you first to get focus on your education ten you will think about that later.lol|`|duvefvbQaa	um ask girls out whether u know them or not most girls in middle school want a bf

Maybe she is so happy to have you and wants to constantly reassure you that she likes you. Just tell her you like affection but you're more of a private person and need a little space once in a while. btw you guys both look good ;)|`|mBXu5G5saa	well you have to make up your mind, if this is really your pic then she maybe just physically attracted to you, but just by the description of what she is doing, she looks like and sounds like a freak no offense, who licks abs, i wouldn't even do that in private farless public, c'mon dude seriously!|`|mpGjPV6Xaa	Just confront her bro, let her know that it bothers you and ask her if she would take a easy for a while. If she still wants to do what she does, then just break up with her.

Well I would be upfront- Ask her what her problem is .You are annoyed, tired of her being so co dependent and immature.|`|bYU77eteaa	Its not normal...and dont break up with her. just tell her how you feel about it.  She probably thinks it pleases  you that you have her undivided attention and love but if you tell her that it's too much, she should back off knowing that it doesn't please you.  Communication is the key to any relationship.  How would you feel if she just up and broke up with you because she didn't like something about you? wouldn't you have rather she told you about it so you could see if you could adjust it OR yall break up mutually if you can't|`|zPvxaOYoaa	well dude you should grow a pair and stay with her cause you dont know how lucky you are i would love to have a gf like urs i wouldnt care if she woke me up in 1 in the moring to talk so if you want to break up then break up with her if you do will be missin out i promise you that|`|kQf5TbUFaa	dam who wouldn't be obsessed say: just set the record straight i like you i like you enough to not have oral or regular sex some is normal like the hearts thing  maybe shes lonely if she has a past of crappy boyfriends and your the one whose been nice to her than she might like the attention|`|22621f93a7534ed2f1a71acf45cf11a4aa	damn ur hot!!...wanna date me?...haha kidding kidding :)...but if your having so many problems with her then talk to her...if u dont think it can be worked out then i think u should break up with her...the point of dating is to find the person u wanna b with for the rest of ur life...can u stand her doing all that to u for the rest of ur life? answer that question and ull figure out what to do|`|NRsC7vaAaa	no just tell her the relationship is not only physical stuff and u guys need to talk and share urs problem just explain to her but don't break up.<br>  can u help me out plz<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AvtK7rczv3sI2Cb429WZJOrsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090226174220AAyxaMm">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|GomB6c83aa	damn i would be obsessed with you too!

If she keeps doing that I would dump her, she obviously doesn't know it bothers you or doesn't care..|`|13LutlWBaa	haha man i think you're living in a fantasy, but if this were true, yall should just get married.  dang she's hot.|`|MLGT3rvZaa	I would confront her in private first. After that if she keeps up with her controlling ways then yes, break up with her.|`|04Te5gzzaa	She's marking her territory in front of everyone...in person and online.  Her behavior in public is to make sure everyone knows that you're her bf and showing all the other girls who may be interested what she offers you.  So if they were interested in going after you, they'd have to do at least as much as she does and more to win you over....which she's hoping nobody can top her.<br>  <br>  If you like the obsessive types than stay with her but if she's taking too much of your time & space then I think you know what to do.|`|FiCl71flaa	This is a girl who obviously is crazy about you.I will admit that her ways are a little unusual and can be a little embarrassing at times. However, she means you no harm and is just not shy about letting the whole world know how she feels about you.You can ask her to tone it down a bit but you do not have to breakup with her. She is a free spirit who enjoys life on her own terms.If you do not love her or care to be in a romance with her,(though you say you love her)simply let her know.But you can not do better that her as a husbands.|`|brkvK1Teaa	Age has a lot to do with it.  She looks rather young so its just a sign of immaturity.  Just have a nice chat with her and ask her if she could tone things down just a bit.  Tell her how much you love her but you feel uncomfortable with her displays of affection around others.  Tell her that you don't want to hurt her feelings but you just want your time together to be special as in just between the 2 of you.  Not with others around.  Good luck|`|tG8tFRY8aa	Don't break up. Public displays of affection are some people's way of expressing their "love" for someone--or, she's just showing off to her friends. Perhaps she wants everyone to know that you're together and that no one can have you? Otherwise, she's just a little too excited. That often happens with first boyfriends, but it can happen after that. Break it to her gently, and she'll get the message. Breaking up is not the answer.|`|Ebffvr2jaa	I would say you need a break and let her know why! Perhaps she thinks you want her to act like that or she is just marking her territory. Either way that's to obsessed. But then if she is like 14 or 15 some girls get really weird when they think they are in love. Good luck too ya and hope you don't get blisters! LOL|`|uA4tJuZbaa	If you're uncomfortable, you need to tell her.<br>  If you talk to her about it and she continues to do things that you don't like, maybe you should break up with her. Things might be hard you (definably her too) but eventually you'll both move on. I think that might be the best thing for you. ATLEAST ask for some space? That might give you time to think about your situation.|`|ETx0TldCaa	DON'T BREAK UP WITH HER YOUR HOT AND SHES HOT LOL BUT JUST SIT HER DOWN AND EXPLAIN WHAT YOU JUST WROTE AND TELL HER ABOUT THE LICKING AND ALL THE MORE KINKY STUFF THAT SHOULDN'T BE IN PUBLIC LOL BUT THE HEARTS ON PICS THING AND POEMS IS NORMAL FOR A GRL TO DO SO DON'T SWEAT THAT JUST WORRY ABOUT THE LICKING SUCKING AND THE SLEEPING WITH UR USED SOCKS BUT SHE PROBABLY IS JEALOUS OF ANOTHER GRL AND WANTS EVERYONE TO KNOW THAT YOUR HER MAN... GOOD LUCK!|`|ZRS0C1CXaa	Tell her how you feel and maybe she doing that because she wants everybody to know that she has you. you should try balancing out her affection by returning her actions. it might make it a great way to break the ice to tell her about her behavior.|`|NtwlsAhUaa	tell her you are uncomfortable with it. Maybe she thinks you like it. Other wise you are in quite a jam. And if u serioulsy don't like what she does tell her because she will never know. Idk if u love her idk if the extent of breaking up with her is fring|`|EtWP9mSMaa	well, thats really weird...<br>  <br>  she is wayy to into you and needs to give you a little space. its kinda creepy no offense.<br>  <br>  you should talk to her and tell her you need some space. if you think you should break up with her then do...but if your really in love then you would'nt be able to..<br>  <br>  :)|`|QY2Bqvifaa	that's bordering on creepy. I agree with you, it'd be fine in private, but out in public? you need to ask her why she does that? can she not wait? and tone down on the mulitiple pics of you. she sounds completely obsessed. but i can see why.|`|27aa83f384a49aa9139cfb5c588539c6aa	Am I the only one who thinks that you're fishing for compliments and using this question as a way to boost your ego by telling people how much this girl is on you?

She's way too attached.<br>  <br>  In the future be less vulgar (did you say the words "zuk my d**k? uhhhh)|`|Zm3QIw4Taa	ummm well us girls get obsessive. but talk to her about it and tell her you like her but to not do so much in public and see what she says. but no i wouldnt break upp with her. it would kill her!|`|06Rlukp7aa	Talk to her gently, let her know some stuff is private and should stay that way.

If you're asking us if you should break up with her then it's obvious you should.|`|jrWpHYAPaa	well she's not obsessive to the point of stalkerish so that's one good thing. I think she's just in love.  And the way she shows it is very different and can be quite awkward at times.<br>  <br>  Like what other people said, if you love her, just talk to her and tell her to try to tone it down. Also, a theory in psychology, people give back what they get: reciprocity.  So if you are giving her alot of attention, think about showing less  love, then she will too and will become more normal. She might be doing these things in return for you giving so much to her.|`|S3qmkm2Vaa	NO this is not normal behavior-clearly she thinks the relationship is going in a direction you don't want it to. i say get out while you can, before she starts to stalk you/check all your things and you have absolutely no life or privacy!<br>  licking you in front of your friends IS NOT normal it's gross. there is a time and place for everything and she is either crazy or has no respect for other people's comfort, either way she has to GO!|`|nXoRPdOSaa	Dang bro, I had a friend that had a gf like that. Except sometimes he would straight up tell her that he didn't want to hang out with her that night. And she would flip **** and do psycho **** like hit him. She loves him a lot and she S's his D and other stuff. But honestly I don't think it's healthy to love someone that much. They broke up a lot and got back together it was ridiculous. But he decided to break up for good idk, talk to her about it.|`|B14s72TNaa	u should give her a chance... ok that does sound a little creepy, but when u r in private just ask her about it, maybe there is a reason she is doing it, maybe she thinks some other girl is going to steal u, or that u r interested in someone else. just let her know how u feel, but make sure she knows you love her|`|K0iUkWQiaa	Dude .. I had a girl like that. She went over the limit and wrote my name in huge letters all over her walls in her room. Her parents then got mad at me, and all this drama happened. :/..

How you are her everything.  She really cares and she is proud to be with you. Just let her know how you feel about what she is doing to annoy you.

Though I was never that controlling or that into pda...<br>  Anyway go somewhere public (but sorta away from the crowd) and tell her you need to talk.  Tell her you appreciate and are flattered that she is so attracted to/in love with you, but it is getting very oppressive and is starting to drive you away.  Tell her that you guys are NOT breaking up but you are giving her the courtesy to tell her how you feel before it's too late!  How she reacts will clue you in a lot about how she will be in the future.  If she goes psycho (especially in public) then it is just going to get worse and you better watch out if you try to break up.  If she is a little hurt but generally calm, and changes her behavior you're good.  Maybe give her something nice as a token that you still love her (us girls are very insecure!  Which is prolly why she is over-affectionate)|`|jdznwjIbaa	OK....first of all if you like the girl why break up with her? right?<br>  ok some girls are just like that but they dont know that they are being obsesive. You need to talk to her and tell her how you feel. ex"hey babe need to talk to you.

S3qmkm2Vaa	i am so sorry you have to go through this. this is a big decision to be going through at 13! <br>  is it really necessary to have the surgery now, can it wait a little so that you can have some time to think about it better and not be rushed?<br>  in the end you have to think about what YOU want and what makes you feel comfortable. when you close your eyes and think of yourself in your heart, do you consider yourself male or female? <br>  that is what you should be thinking about. <br>  the choice about having kids or not is hard and the fact that your male reproductive system doesn't work is something to consider for your future relations with the opposite sex. <br>  that is another question to consider: do you feel attracted to girls, or boys? <br>  good luck with everything.|`|KSK22vHUaa	The hospital doesn't "screw up" names like that.  <br>  IF you were born a hermaphrodite, they would have known at birth.<br>  People with working female parts and non-working make parts are not mistaken for male at birth.<br>  <br>  But if you want to be a girl, fine.  Be a girl.  Just quit trolling!
16f8H4alaa	don't worry about it. you don't need to do anything you don't want to.
2i53Vdiwaa	I guess your parents are pissed because it happened in the school parking lot. A place where you should have been extra careful, you were lucky it was a car you hit and not a child.  <br>  Anyway, tell them you are sorry and you realize it was your fault and it could have been much worse.  Reassure them you will be extra careful in future.  <br>  They just need to be able to trust you again, and for that they have to know you understand the dangers and responsibility's of being a driver.|`|7511595fc4d3e31538e8df239de8a7c5aa	pay for it|`|1hcupwT4aa	The "and as usual" kind of tells me that this isn't your first accident...<br>  It was your fault, you have GOT to be more careful. Lucky you this happened in a school parking lot and not on a speed limit 80 highway. You shouldn't be worried about car insurance but more so your life, or the life of another if you aren't a bit more careful.<br>  <br>  Your dad is taking you off insurance because he wants you to stop making mistakes like this. Or if you do, that you pay for it and not him. What you can do is drive more carefully and let your dad see that so maybe he'll let you keep it. At least you aren't thinking about driving without the insurance, please don't do that.<br>  <br>  -sigh-...|`|KSK22vHUaa	Don't even worry about getting insurance.  A week of them having to drive you places will piss them off.  Just play cool, take your punishments, go with the flow, and they'll get tired of it and put you back behind the wheel.  Just be more careful the next time!|`|SjEH1Lx6aa	That sounds pretty drastic, I doubt this is your first accident. You're just going to have to wait a bit before they allow you to prove you're a careful driver.
52e1044b00e7fe6ffc7e96609443787daa	Depends. My ex-fiance used to say that once a day. We got engaged and a month later he left me for another girl.<br>  <br>  My now boyfriend is amazing, and we've slowly started to talk about it. He told me one day he wanted to marry me, and I honestly believe him. He's the best man I've ever met, and I'd be so lucky to be his wife.|`|4lL34wJnaa	I think it all depends on the guy's age and maturity level.  <br>  <br>  In high school, I was with a guy for 2.5 years and we thought we'd get married and be together forever.  That ended the beginning of my senior year!<br>  <br>  With that said, in college, my college sweetheart said he was going to marry me.  We moved in together after school.  He still kept saying he was going to marry me.  After almost 9 years together he finally proposed!  We're getting married 7-11-09!|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	I've been told they wanted to marry me and then they all left me a week later or so. Trust me, they all lie. But they bought me a ring, but they lied-so oh well, I still have the ring!|`|5wfIHHGTaa	honey, just because a guy tells you that, doesnt mean it will happen. A guy can tell you that you have the key to his heart, and then turn around and dump you for some other girl or something crazy like that. I will tell you this- dont get your hopes up (and im not saying that he wont) but just in case your relationship has problems, and you both decide to go seperate ways, you'll always think "well what if we done something different" etc. Guys will tell you everything you wanna hear just to get in your pants, and not ALL guys are like that, but most are. And i think alot of women can agree with that. I hope he does ask you, if thats what you both want!|`|BbdWpp1Caa	You've had some slightly negative replies. I agree with them. Wait and see. but my fiance told me he wanted to marry me and now we are...he proposed 3 yrs after.|`|95M9WTqoaa	has he proposed? If he has at least you know he intends on marrying you. If he hasnt and he keeps saying that hes going to marry you then he is just trying to buy time.|`|WaTezVS0aa	Not to be a downer, but don't get your hopes too high until he does propose. I only say this because my best friend was with a guy that we all thought was "the one." It was the first time she was really in love with a boyfriend. A week before he broke up with her, he had said " I love you and want to spend the rest of my life with you." They had been talking and making plans for after graduating college, and where they wanted to live. Then all of a sudden he said "well i haven't been feeling the spark lately" and broke up with her. I know this isn't an answer that you want to hear, but it's always possible|`|yLVys9uTaa	well. When I was 16 my boyfriend told me he'd marry me. then he dumped me for another girl..soooo it all depends on what age we're talking about. <br>  if you're older like in your 20's then yes maybe hes seirous. <br>  Maybe he's wairting for the right time. just enjoy eachother for now and he should plop the quetion soon :]|`|HcboXOmjaa	The only person who really knows this answer is your boyfriend.  We are not fortune tellers and we have no idea what is going to happen and if he will, in fact, marry you. You will just have to wait or maybe just ask him when he wants to marry you.|`|X8YNwxm7aa	i dont think he is serious. if he would want to marry you, he would. there would no point to wait unless he wants to pay for wedding himself and he doesnt have money now..
aDL7xmt6aa	If you're not dating you don't need to fear marriage.|`|zNjACkxpaa	I am going to speculate that your parent's marriage is pretty bad and if affected your out look on marriage.<br>  <br>  You don't ever have to get married if you do not want to. You can convince your parents - who BTW should back they hell off you're 35 not 13-- that you have ample money to pay for care should you become ill after they die. By a long term care insurance policy<br>  <br>  However, and this is from my heart, I think you really need to see a psychiatrist to talk to some one about your fear of commitment, your view of women being gold diggers and children being a drain on your life.<br>  <br>  It sounds like Mommy and Daddy really did a number on you.  I bet Mommy told you girls are evil and will hurt you, that you were no good and that everything they sacrificed for you and what do they get in return nothing. You are going to die lonely and alone.  Wow|`|AA10248966	You raise 100 issues here. Let me address a few:<br>  <br>  First of all you MUST tell parents to stop it already, that if they want you in their lives, they are NOT to bring up marriage again, ever. If they refuse to understand, for whatever the reason, you MUST dump them until they will respect your wishes. They are control freaks who want what they want. and that is for you to live THEIR ideal; life and have someone which makes THEM feel as if THEY succeeded in life by you getting married, family, and grand kids. They are very mentally messed up.<br>  <br>  However, that being said, you see the glass less than 1/20 full. You are a time bomb waiting to happen. There is a lot seriously wrong with you emotionally if you have no desires for a girlfriend and you not gay...or are you?. You need a complete battery psychological tests for emotional, behavioral, and the 6 anxiety disorders. You are a dysfunctional human, not a bad ONE, but very mentally challenged in my open on based on my years in seminars, research, therapy, etc...and a ton of books. You are a very fearful person who thinks everything bad will come your way. It is not so, but you do believe it with All your heart. It is a form of mental illness.<br>  <br>  This is not criticism of you: You MUST get down to the bottom of why you feel like you do, and why you do something called disasterize everything in life./ Parents Will relent because you allow it.<br>  <br>  Good luck really.|`|2KC467tFaa	You're not forced to get married. I do wish you knew that all marriages are not the same. Fights happen, but if there is communication in the relationship, fights are few and far between. I'm married to my best friend. We do everything together. I was afraid marriage would be work and predetermined jobs based on gender. I was completely wrong. Marriage is what you make it. It can be work, but it can also be the most valuable thing in someone's life. Not all women care about money. Not all couples want children. I'm not trying to talk you into finding a wife, but I am trying to open your eyes and mind to something that you're not familiar with. People marry because they find happiness in having a partner. If you find happiness in being single, stay single. Everyone is different, and that's ok. Do whatever makes you truly happy.|`|6OnqUyseaa	I think you feel many legitimate reasons for not marrying.<br>  <br>  Yes .. enjoy your life as you choose .. it's "your" life.<br>  <br>  If you aren't interested in having kids - then it is great that you recognize that fact.<br>  <br>  Don't talk yourself into doing something that you don't want to do - and doing something that you are not interested in.<br>  <br>  Enjoy you life with what makes "you" happy !! .. other people make their own choices according to what makes them happiest - - so you should have the same right.<br>  <br>  You sound like you have many potent beliefs about marriage, kids, and women ... so you should listen to yourself.<br>  <br>  Be as happy as you can everyday.|`|a0b1f8c0a89f6e9a6fb1048bcf570db3aa	You validated yourself pretty much but my problem is that you started with "fear." Love is risk, and yes it is pain but at its best it is wonderful. For me (divorcing now, I NEVER would have thought it would end this way) the risk is now too high to take again so I understand your feellings. I have issues when people allow FEAR to be their reasons for anything! Let it be that you want your solitude and you don't trust people. Many women marry for love, not money at all. Not everyone is insecure and materialistic. Don't cheat yourself out of an experience because you are concerned about self preservation. Do it because of what you want, not because of what you DON'T want.<br>  Peace.|`|iTVoXWjxaa	you seem like a  guy that might have been burned, its okay man, you want to talk about it.|`|3aPA20U8aa	wow, that's alot for one person to be feeling all at once. there are so many answers to this question, first you have to decide what you want for your life, not what your parents think and feel. at first i just thought well,this guy is just selfish but i'm thinking  that's a front, your just too afraid of pain (from a relationship),or rejection,or maybe even trying to hard.  there is nothing wrong with being single if that's what you truly want,  a relationship is about companionship, a good relationship is a variety of things, both good and bad. and you can't have a good marriage without a decent start. to many people rush to get marriage and miss the importance of dating   bottom line this is your life live it accordingly.   peace|`|BHAIDeTbaa	Well i think its very sad the way you feel. i believe there is a right person out there for everyone. If you never take a chance in life you will never realise what your missing out on. It seems all you care about is your money, if that is enough to keep you warm at night than that's your chose. I believe you will wake up one day and regret your choices though! Not every girl is after your money, why not find a girl who has her own money and career as well.|`|TeS7yYaAaa	dont get married! what make you tink you have to?|`|UUrqECXIaa	Since you've never even had a date with a woman, I don't' think its fair to say that women are mostly painful burdens to men. lol. It doesn't really sound like you are afraid of marriage; it sounds more like you do not want a relationship with a woman.<br>  <br>  If you are happy with your life the way it is that's all that matters. I agree with you, it is your right to live your life any way that you choose. You don't have to get married or be in a relationship to be happy. Unfortunately, it sounds like your parents are not going to accept this and you will all just have to learn to agree to disagree.|`|lg6jexk7aa	As a person who doesn't want to get married myself - I have to say, your ideas about marriage and women is completely warped.  Your only focusing on the bad and not the good (according to you - there is nothing good about women and marriage) but there can be some great things about those two ideals.<br>  <br>  Its your parents job to make you miserable and to pressure you into marriage and kids because it is THEIR want and they can't possess it without you.  Just tell them that some people are made for marriage - other aren't and that's the category you fall into and they should just accept it and move on.
pi5WKPNwaa	Hum? I have to say the whole think is kinda corny, but sounds like there is something there.  I would skip the note and just ask her if she wants to hang out sometime after work. Women like confidences. I would said, "Your note was sweet and I could not come up with a way to reply that is not totaly corny. I was hoping we could hang out after work, maybe go for a drink over at _____?"  This would show that you are interested and honest and leaves yourself open. However, you have a quick come back if she is hesitant. "It dose not have to be a date, but can never have to many friends....right?"|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	were one of the colors in the letter pink? that's a sure sign!|`|lFzXZQQDaa	say just that...<br>  <br>  " i like you alot. i want to be more than friends"|`|ST6O0oXsaa	O shoot dude your in there. Just talk up some smack and race her. <br>  <br>  Lose it on purpose. Trust me this is the way to go. I had the same situation and it worked out for me but with soccer/baseball.|`|SuMwWNfyaa	LMAOOOO.<br>  <br>  a note?<br>  <br>  HA.<br>  <br>  LMFAOOOOOOO|`|OpiJAxr1aa	lol lame|`|X2zXDckpaa	"haha cool cool, hey maybe we should hang out somtime? when do you want to race?"<br>  should work :p|`|rrMYRLpXaa	XD Haha. Sweet. :D<br>  <br>  You should probably write a simple note to contrast with it. Just scribble, "Race ya" on a note and right after she reads it, go up to her and tap her shoulder to race. XD So you should give the note to her outside of school in front of her friends or something.|`|8QE30IXkaa	Why don't you stop being a wimp and actually talk to her instead of writing notes all the time. Then maybe you might actually get something accomplished.|`|a5SsIeWKaa	DON'T WRITE A NOTE ABOUT YOU LIKING HER OR TO ASK HER OUT!!! JUST ASK HER, NO MATTER HOW SHY YOU ARE!!! You will just look like a joke.|`|mXyqcAy5aa	Why dont u do away with the letters  and talk to her up front and personal ,   and get things going that way   Good Luck|`|2drqM7u8aa	i think this is really cute and sweet. maybe tell you that you wanna hang out sometime and get to know her better. good luck and hope this helps =)|`|M33rc7I0aa	ima girl but i dont have a problem helping you and no im not gay....but anyways here's and idea how about you take the first move and say your name a heart then her name and under it put the best couple of runners after that write this little rhyming thing like im your mac to your cheeses and tht stuff becuase my friend get stuff like that from her boyfirnd and she just LOVE them ad its so annoying about how they act...lol...but then its so cute/corny of how they love each other|`|Xhp69x9Naa	well since you drawing why not put you name a + and her name then an equals sign then a question mark...like this<br>  <br>  you+her=? <br>  <br>  so that she gets the point that you like her but don't want to make any moves on her so you pretty much asking if she likes you <br>  <br>  if she puts a heart where the ? is then you will know she likes you.<br>  <br>  good luck (:|`|JzK59nt1aa	I would send a note with a name and place for the race, or it doesn't even have to be a race, just a date (I mean how two people go on a date, not a time of the year aha). Upgrade from letter writing and talk in person! Make it obvious though that it is a date and not just hanging out. It sounded in her letter like she was asking you out and she obviously likes you, so just make sure to be really flirty back and ask her out asap|`|6ObDxKdCaa	My friend sends notes to. When you do race her, say she's really good and wink. The next day, write her a note that says I really like you and i was wondering if you feel the same way about me. It make take a while for her to reply but don't nag her. If that doesn't work write a poem including all your feelings in it. If you do this it is SO romantic. I wish my boyfriend did something like this|`|tNTCZPBcaa	Try suggesting you go out for drinks or coffee.<br>  Then see how she reacts, is she ok with it, does she invite other people.<br>  does she act flirty while out.<br>  then ask her out again, but this time like dancing or dinner.<br>  Hope that helps at least a little.|`|2wndt5MSaa	First off, if you're planning to ask her out, you should definitely ask her in person (passing notes are cute, but not for dates). Second, it seems like she likes you, so you should totally go for it.|`|HKoLBQBUaa	that is so sweet u make me want to cry haha lol. <br>  <br>  tell her how she makes you feel and how amazing she is|`|SlfEkPgtaa	well you should start it off by writing in pretty bubble letters that she i the smartest or something and then say ok but only if you can hang out afterward. then sign your name. good luck|`|sMWFq39Saa	i dont get it..|`|OYGGdSLcaa	how old are you and she?|`|8lsWEfcZaa	OMG! I am sooo happy for u!<br>  <br>  I'm a grl so... trust me be as flirty as possible.... don't beat around the bush but don't be tottaly straight forward. Come out with it in an unique.. yet adorably classic way. <br>  <br>  For example:   (insert her name here) <3  ,<br>  <br>       Sounds like fun.... and after the race maybe we could go out and eat. <br>  <br>                                                                  Xoxo<br>                                                                -(insert you name here) <3<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  keeping it short  (like one sentance) will be super flirty! putting hearts b y ur names will make her HEART flutter.  And returning the challenge is just....well....hawt. :)<br>  <br>  Best of luck -Alison <3 XxooxX|`|UGQt96UKaa	yeah you should write stuff about how great the girl is and just write all the reasons you like her and at the very end of the note just be like, "you are like the best thing that has ever happened to me and i rly want to be more than just friends with you!" that should prolly get her to go out with you!!!<br>  oh yeah and always compliment the girl on her eyes....... it tells her that you are looking at her face when you are talking to her... (and not "somewhere else" if ya know what i mean!) it scores major brownie points!!!|`|s564PQUHaa	first. no letter passing. second. when you ask for her number, don't ask for the number. ask for the email. when she says yes give her a pen and a piece of paper. when she writes down the @ sign then ask for the number. Just "and put your number down while you're at it." then as a joke, while she's writing down her number say, "and your social security" with a smile. <br>  <br>  when you finally get the number, don't do the wait 3 days bull ****. just do it the same day and have a conversation. while you guys are talking and you are trying to ask her out, say "hey i'm going to do something this weekend. would you like to come along." and convince her to come along.
6sJhoXAAaa	Don't expect too much too soon; don't be overly jealous; don't push too hard; don't take everything said in the heat of the moment to heart.<br>  <br>  Be nice, friendly, honest, and happy.

The best advice I can give to you is learn to fight fairly, and trust each other.<br>  <br>  Every couple fights, it's inevitable and normal. You just have to realize how each of you fight. One person might want to talk about it right away while the other wants to give it a rest and talk about it later. You just have to meet at a happy medium... compromise!<br>  <br>  Also, trust is the key to any happy relationship! If you don't trust each other then there is going to be a ton of unecessary fights.  <br>  <br>  Every relationshp goes through it's up's & down's. You just have to remember that it will pass, and work through those times together.|`|BaXSNq3aaa	well, it mostly depends on how your relationship is. but all i can say, stay true to eachother. treat eachother right, love eachother in every possible way. always be there for eachother. make eachother happy. have fun and enjoy your relationship!|`|b0b2fde471b9f267d4e0783db94b4f0baa	Be yourself, laugh, and make inside jokes/stories|`|d99eRVlGaa	don't rush anything.

If your not laid back it creates a stiff environment so it sucks and feels uncomfortable.|`|UdOM5taDaa	Respect, honesty and affection.  :)
aDL7xmt6aa	Each pays their own way.|`|zNjACkxpaa	well according to the old etiquette books the brides family pays for everything except the flowers and the rehearsal dinner. So ....<br>  <br>  However this is 2009 and the rules have been somewhat relaxed. When the couple is oder and established in their careers often  the bride and groom pay their own way and the parent contribute what they can.<br>  <br>  The best course of action is to have a business meeting with the couple and both sets of parents and spell out who will pay for what and how much they can actually contribute.<br>  <br>  If one of the families is extremely well off they can pick up the whole tab. I have know a couple guys whose parents wanted to pay for the entire wedding. <br>  <br>  Just remember  no one should go into debt for a wedding. Figure out a budget that everyone can agree upon.|`|147607adf55cb5f3a236aadc7f042230aa	Id say with your marriage, both you and your new spouse should be paying for your own wedding.<br>  <br>  As for your daughters wedding, the brides parents are suppose to pay for the majority, but nothing is written in stone.<br>  <br>  As for your step-sons marriage, the majority should be paid by the brides family.|`|AA11996507	Each couple should pay for their own wedding.  If the "kids" can't foot the bill for their own wedding, they're not ready for the responsibilities of marriage.|`|E5KNhDKwaa	how many times are you going threw this?you always pay,a man always pays "the price"of marraige.pretend to be broke the third time,or you might reay be broke.|`|KwNpyp3saa	When I got married, six years ago, we paid for it ourselves.

ufBNkOOTaa	Not sure what it is you exactly you want help with.  Do you want to be his girlfriend or what.  Id say leave it alone unless your cool with being friends with benefits.  Your in high school and a long distance relationship doesn't benefit you as much as it does him, unless you just want some on the side.  Im sure hes got flings going on as well and unless your around him 24/7 you cant say he doesn't hit on girls.  Well I guess they could just be hitting on him lol.      <br>  <br>  Do your friends like him as well, and does he already have a gf, thats something you should ask.  <br>  <br>  I dont see any long term relationship in this but its your life.  If your cool with it being just physical let him know. <br>  <br>  Whatever you do, dont get played.|`|CiJOVfcXaa	spend time with him on weekends. that all i can say|`|WVeKHhwNaa	well, you are only in high school, so you have your whole life ahead of you. most college guys will cheat on their girlfriends back home, simply because they hardly ever see them. also, if he is in his 20's, he is probably only looking for sex, since guys hit their sexual peak during their 20's. my advice would be to stay away from this one, and to find someone closer to home and who is closer to your age. but if you know him really well, and feel like he wouldnt cheat, then give it a try.|`|c62CfX9Daa	Well I would just tell him how you feel and see if he feels the same way.
4Q4dZJHpaa	Im not sure,it kinda has to work both ways.if yous are both comfortable with it then its cool.im still friends with most of my exes but you cant be to friendly if your seein someone else cos to be honest it does make people feel a bit jealous even when they know they trust them n whats good for the goose is good for the gander.If you brought it up in a subtle way hed probably understand,ask him if it was the other way round would he mind?|`|06Rlukp7aa	you have every right to be bothered by this. She is his ex and needs to stay a part of his past. If he gets mad at you for talking to your ex, but does the same thing, he is being a hypocriate. If he truly cares about you, he will let her go. Good luck.|`|AA10042205	Just leave it alone, and enjoy the moment.  Why make a stink over a friend of his, that possibly could become one of your friends.|`|agLtkiIhaa	u should talk to him cause maybe hes not over his ex, he might be using u to make hi ex jealous. im not saying thats whats he doing but it is an idea.|`|TcWrV8YZaa	let it go. wut u have is real. the ***** is just jealous of u
1RmjF6G8aa	I don't think that it's right what your "friends" are doing. If they were true friends, they wouldn't leave you behind. I'm sorry that this is happening to you. Now, to find a true friend, you have to just be yourself. Completely honest. Maybe you should step out of your comfort zone. Try to talk to more people, but remember, just be yourself. Say the kind of stuff that you usually say when your around your family and stuff. : )
06Rlukp7aa	He may be over the honeymoon phase. if he wants to be with you, he can't be best friends with his ex, simple as that. I would talk to him less on the phone. If he really wants to be with you, he will need to spend more time with you in person, simple as that.|`|xCjUEiB3aa	Well see you answered your own question...If RANDOMLY the ex has popped out of nowhere BY ANY CHANCE wouldn't you think that he might like her sorry to say?...i mean if she came out of nowhere and he told you hes not interested in you anymore it might just be becuz the ex is texting and seeing him and TRYING to get him back...Sit down and talk to your ex and if this continues i would say try backing off of your bf and see what happens. GoodLUCk!!|`|uTQCKQQ9aa	He just wants to play that's all let him go and fine your own thing. Even get a new b/f and forget about the ex let her it want work out. you go and date and be happy.

Don't waste your time because if he doesn't want to be with you after a year long relationship then that's that.  He probably knows most things about you already and there's no new side for him to fall back in love with.

So just play cool and maby he will ask you out agin.|`|sLMI5Kaiaa	sorry i dunno|`|ElQM7Z3Gaa	Do YOU still love him. The best way to be in a good relationship is communication. Talk deeply to him. However, boys can sometimes be scared off by your caring too much. Sometimes laying off and pretending you dont even care is the best thing to do. By doing that, he will want you. But this depends on the guy, sometimes it can send the wrong message. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps, ive had LOTS of guy experience.|`|xM4CumQoaa	loose the douche. he dont deserve anyone.|`|lZ9Dl5Nhaa	Dump this douche bag.  He's either cheating on you, or he's going to be pretty soon.  If he really loves you, he'll try to get you back.|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	There is a simple solution-ASK HIM. Get him and ask him what the deal is. Why be so weak?|`|NkHU8tEJaa	He's a freak or a game-player.

AA10886262	You should only be happy when it's right, you are depressed because you know it isn't right.........it's okay!  <br>  <br>  You call your mom in the morning, tell her you are pulling the plug on the wedding because you know in your heart this is all wrong (your mom will be elated because she is your mom and has known all along this wasn't right)...your mom will call invited guests and just tell them the wedding is off......<br>  <br>  YOU on the other hand, have to tell your fiance....and be strong, YOU are doing both of you a great service in calling it off when you know it is not right; it will hurt, but in the long run you both will be better off.....<br>  <br>  It's okay hon, you are SMART to listen to your gut....why go through with something you don't believe in....Divorce is way worse than calling off a wedding, truly it is!  Be strong....|`|hVrfm4eIaa	Call it off, immediately.  You absolutely still have a choice about getting married and if it's not right it's not right.  Letting your guests know ASAP will give them the best chance of getting a refund (maybe they could exchange the tickets) or turn the trip into a regular Hawaiian vacation.  Here is a forum for women who have cancelled their weddings: <a href="http://www.theregoesthebride.com/msgs/index.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://www.theregoesthebride.com/msgs/in...</a><br>  I'm sure you will find a lot of support and suggestions there.  Good luck!|`|jEC8Ctp5aa	Maybe if you could articulate why you feel trapped, and figure out exactly what happened that made you change your mind, you could reconcile it and maybe end up not cancelling after all.<br>  <br>  So, what gives? What happened? Let us help you !!<br>  <br>  What's the story, morning glory?|`|jPJ9MTCwaa	I haven't been in a similar situation but things like this happen.  While it's a hassle to have to cancel tickets, many airlines will work with people by say charging a little bit and letting people change their ticket (so they can use it for something else).  No one who would be going to your wedding and obviously cares about you would want you to enter into something you don't feel comfortable with.  That would be really kind of rude if you said you were calling off the wedding because of a personal reason and they get in your face about it.  Tell people NOW though so that they have time to figure their own stuff out.|`|yhfG07Jtaa	First, take care of yourself. If you don't want to marry the fellow, don't let people spend their money to watch a sham.<br>  Their money is gone - so what next? It's like buying a nasty meal. Your money is gone, but you don't have to eat the garbage. Tell them instantly that the wedding is off, you've got 5 months to help them try to recover their expenses. Airlines are begging for mercy, your people might get a refund.|`|469c6489c23d9264a9454703f8b8c28baa	I know people who have been in this situation. Those who have cancelled have always felt bad about it, but would an early divorce really have been better?<br>  <br>  I can tell you that not one of your close family and friends, not one of the people who really love you, would want you to go ahead with a sham of a wedding to someone you can't be happy with, even if it does cost them money. Yes, they will be temporarily annoyed, but anyone who really cares about you will in the long run be more worried about *you* than about the money.|`|5wfIHHGTaa	Honey, sounds like your in a sticky situation. If you dont feel like its right, PLEASE dont do it. Follow your heart, and dont worry about what everyone else thinks. As for the "out of towners" no, they might not be able to get their money back for plane tickets, but think about it this way- what if they came down to Hawaii, and then you get to the alter, and decide that you just cant do it. Do you think they would be more disappointed to see you not happy, or to not get their money back? Hopefully, your family/friends would want to see you happy, and whether that be getting married or not, you need to make sure its what you want! Good luck!|`|e5k8Bsxpaa	Cancel it. Five months is a long time. Hopefully the airlines will be accommodating. What's for sure is that your guests would not want you getting married because of them.<br>  <br>  Edit<br>  Also, perhaps you can tell the guests that if they experience problems with getting refunds, you can discuss it with the airline and explain the situation. Just an option that you may want to consider.<br>  <br>  Edit <br>  Also perhaps there is a chance that these are just jitters. Talk about your feelings with your fiance. It will help you decide what to do. Perhaps after your talk you may feel a lot better. Or perhaps after this talk you two may decide that it's not right. You need to discuss it before you make any rash decisions. You owe him that much. (Unless he physically or emotionally abuses you.)|`|tVqLmImUaa	This is actually more common than you think. My brother-in-law had arranged a wedding in germany, and we'd booked expensive plane tickets. He called it off, and we got a partial refund for the flights. Sure, it's a bit of a bummer, but totally understandable. <br>  <br>  MUCH better than going through with an expensive sham wedding, which will end up being way more complicated and painful in the long run.<br>  <br>  You're actually "screwing everyone over" more by going through with it - a temporary inconvenience turns into a long-term mess. They'll respect you for it, and not being another divorce statistic. <br>  <br>  A wedding is not just a show for other people. In years to come, you'll be so grateful you had the courage and sensibility.|`|4POGapREaa	Well, that's your bad.  Obviously you have money set aside for this whole shindig in Hawaii so cancel it & pay back your guests that already booked it.  My guess is that you'll still come out ahead financially if you don't go through with it.  A divorce would end up costing you a hell of a lot more so . . .|`|h6NqNzHAaa	Cancel the wedding, immediately. <br>  Talk with the people who already bought tix and ask if they still want to go and party it up some! Some can't get a refund so why not go and have a good vacation.
twVyisGnaa	Talk to your school counselor or a family or marriage therapist, but one that actually makes sense.  Let your parents know that their arguing and b*tching is affecting you and not just them.  Tell them what you feel about this, and please don't commit suicide, for that will make things worse.  You've got too much to live for, man, and you shouldn't kill your potential just because your parents are fighting.  Good luck and Peace.<br>  <br>  VIVA LA RAZA!|`|CpeGFIJmaa	Look Suicide is not going solve the problem. You need to stand up for yourself. Loot at this as a generation gap. They won;t be able to understand you as they haven't been in your position.<br>  At this point of time, try to do good things that you enjoy, do not disrespect your parents even if they are wrong, spent time on something fruitful and make them proud of you.|`|nM6us26Gaa	Well, suicide isn't the answer, most definitely >.<. My parents are exactly the same way, and when I became tired of it, I just cut off contact. When I came home from school, I said not a word, but I went to my room. When they wanted to talk to me, I kept the conversation short and sweet, hinting through my tone that I didn't want to talk. My advise, just don't do anything to start an argument. If you're thinking about saying something, consider the consequences. For example...If you wanted to ask your dad for money, and you know you'll argue about it, I say you forget him and try to get money elsewhere. To stay away from trouble, avoid it at all costs. It's not exactly the easiest thing to do, and it can be inconvenient, but at least you won't fight as much.

AA10592574	yup. my friend is irritating. she is constantly seeing if i have better grades than her, she punches me. so, being the way that i am, i punch her back. not even that hard, and she's like wahhh, wahhhh! that hurts!!!! and also, you can't tell anything to her because she uses it against you, so when she asks me something i say stuff like i don't know, and she doesn't get why i don't tell her anything. and she flips out if i try to tell her something funny, that is an insult.<br>  <br>  also, she is an ignoramus and that annoys me. it's that she doesn't know what things that most people know are. once, she was talking to me about this girl that she hates and the teacher comes up and tells us to stop gossiping. and then when the teacher turns away, she goes what's gossiping? (i mean, really? gossiping?) and it annoys me. you're lucky you can get away from her, cuz i can't. all the good friends are leaving for other schools, while i'm still stuck with her. so, yeah. .<br>  <br>  it also annoys me that she types lyke dis. and she says f**k all the time. it never stops.<br>  <br>  just try to avoid her and try to not keep in touch. hope it helps! :]

jI9dpKxWaa	you are not a bad person for choosing not to help her because ultimately we all have to agree that sometimes these kind of people get themselves in the situations that they're in. If your mom keeps bugging you about helping her, then i suggest you should explain to her whats going on so she can get a better picture of whats happening. Good Luck:]|`|xFu0ujeFaa	You are not a bad person at all to feel this way. I don'tt think I know one person who enjoys drama, and if you feel that her becoming a big part of your life aka living with you is not a good idea, then you need to tell her. I would never purposely bring drama into my life and I hope that you wouldn't either... The advice I give you is tell her how you feel, it may not seem that easy but its probably the best you can do.|`|X9tdSLe9aa	You are not. Your like me, I hate drama and its not your fault if you do not want to get involved. Its her life she should be the one dealing with it.

There are some people who grow accustomed to using other people so they can get attention and get their way.  This sounds like one of those situations. You need to be honest with your mom and tell her what you know and what your suspicions are.  Second, you need to tell this girl that she should go talk to her parents, be honest with them and try to work out any problems she might have had.  Just tell her that her issues are with her parents and she sincerely needs to give it some effort to get her problems solved.|`|wgT8NeR9aa	No i Don't think so<br>  She sounds like a liar<br>  You know what they say<br>  Once a liar always a liar<br>  although i would feel bad for her<br>  I can understand how she feel<br>  I have also been through a lot<br>  &Do wish more people were there for me<br>  But if she is too dramatic<br>  Let her know<br>  She is a nice person<br>  You don't have a problem with her<br>  You as well have issues and<br>  You don't want to bit off more than you can chew<br>  Its sounds honest and upfront<br>  although let her know<br>  Your mom is there for her<br>  But you can't be as much as <br>  You'd like to<br>  Let her down easy<br>  You don't want to be rude|`|pj4agFiOaa	no|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	No, this makes you look mature.

If she comes to your home again just don't answer the door. Don't answer the phone. Just ignore her and she will move on to another victim. But make sure your mom knows she is trouble and hangs ( or hung ) out with a bad crowd. What is up with your mom anyway, usually they are just the opposite !!

These days NO one wants to be bothered with anyone else because they want to live their own happy little lives, but can't you ever stop to think about the people out there who have no one to turn to? She felt that she could trust you and confide in you and what do you do? You shove it in her face, there's nothing wrong with not wanting drama but there is something wrong with refusing to be there for someone who obviously thinks enough of you to turn to you for advice and comfort. Just think about it.|`|7AndmAg4aa	of course this doesn't. she's just playing the guilt trip on your mom and you aren't falling for it. it doesn't sound like you two are very good friends. but maybe your the only on left that she can go to. tell her that you have too much going on in your life to deal with her life too. good luck.|`|PumDOQC9aa	I don't think it makes you a bad person if you don't want to help her out because the way she acts at school  "trying to be a bad *** or what not " now she wants help from you .

I do not feel bad for her.|`|mv7kD5hfaa	It sounds like it's more a question of 'attention' than help . . I think you're right with the idea that she creates drama . . She probably does that because internally she has incredibly low self-esteem which would also explain the lying, swearing, and trying to hang around the bad crowd . . I wouldn't doubt there are/were troubles at home, but until this girl finds her own inner confidence, there will be nothing you or your mother can do for her . .|`|g2VCzUKoaa	No way! if you have a problem with this girl just tell her these exact word Get the **** away from me and she will leave thats how my brother handeled it when he was in 8th grade! and say it in front of a somewhat small croud! if that doesnt work just tell her Leave me alone or i will call the cops and if she says yea right you loser just go to a teacher or principal and tell what happened with you and this girl|`|XA27FyS8aa	Of course not.. thats just the way you feel about her you can confront your mom and say i dont like this girl could u please leave me out of this ... or you can confront her and say listen your a nice person but i cant deal with all this drama so could you please give me a little space???... and sorry if u confront her and she gets offended when u say that<br>  <br>  hope it works :)|`|cyEi99Upaa	Not at all.

jPJ9MTCwaa	We did have an engagement party.  Not everyone does though.  His grandparents celebrated their 60th wedding anniversary so we went home to celebrate that with them (we like about 2,800 miles away).  It was about 2 months after we got engaged.  The day after his grandparent's anniversary, his cousin and aunt threw us a lovely little engagement party at her house.  It was just BBQ and music and cake and his family, very nice.  Really people just chatted, we had cake, played some games in the backyard, nothing unusual.  My family is scattered everywhere so my side of the family did not have a party.  You don't throw yourself one, someone else does, so if someone does, great, if not, it doesn't matter.|`|76nTvO4iaa	They are not required!<br>  <br>  The engagement parties I have mostly been to have been a cocktail party format.  They are held in the evening.<br>  <br>  The purpose it for the parents to announce the engagement (even though everyone already knows) and to announce the wedding date. <br>  <br>  It is attended by the bride, groom, their respective families and close friends (of family and bride & groom).  It's a chance for the families to get better acquainted before "the wedding" kicks into high gear.<br>  <br>  As for timing, they're usually held 6 weeks to 2 months after the couple actually becomes engaged, because it takes that long to get the party planned and invitations sent out.<br>  <br>  Only people who will be "for sure" invited to the wedding should be invited to the engagement party.<br>  <br>  They are not gift giving occasions - they are a social event only.<br>  <br>  I hope that helps!<br>  <br>  Happyy engagement!|`|lgxE5nUoaa	We didn't have an engagement party - it's not necessary - totally up to you.|`|CkN4pgpCaa	You don't have to.  If you do have one, it should be a week or two to a month or two after the engagement happens.  It's to celebrate the engagement, not the wedding, so it should be close to that time.  If you do have one, it can be totally casual... we just had a happy hour with some friends.  But you can do a BBQ or something more formal.  Whatever you want!
X5W3leICaa	No there is no law. You make the rules, its your house, you enforce them. Tell her what you expect and if she cant follow those rules shes out, tough, but its what you got to do.|`|VALxlwYSaa	It's up to you. <br>  I would wait to see how serious their relationship is. If she's only been staying there for a while, but has her own house, then there's the possibility that they might not last long, she may move back to her house, and maybe they are just seeing if they can handle living together. <br>  <br>  I would say all of you sit down and talk about it. Ask her if she plans on staying in the house permanently and if she says yes tell her what you expect. If she's not planning on staying then you can tell her whatever you feel. Is she bothering you by being there? Making a mess? Eating your food? Using too much water? <br>  Just sit down and talk to them all. It's yours and your wife's house and your going to have to take control if you want something done.|`|AA10087448	it's whatever you decide.|`|niq3ETl0aa	Leave it alone if they aren't eating your food.  OMG, a law? For cryin' outloud. Stop being so petty. If you're hurting for money and the water bill has really gone up, ask him to make up the difference.|`|ODJ9YWeAaa	talk to him about it. and if shes there everyday and sleeps there and uses the utilities then she should also play. give it 2 weeks|`|Eh9Tmgzhaa	2daiis shes takin advantage|`|8pG8Y3rJaa	Your brother-in-law is already an equal party - he pays as much as the two of you combined.
qAHAb5RRaa	It means that no matter how attached to his girlfriend he very well may be you are still in the back of his mind. <br>  He very obviously has strong feelings for you. And even though you knoeach otherer well, when you text, for guys, it seems to add an air of mystery to the relationship. He is fascinated by you. <br>  His girlfriend is the pleasant reality while you literally are "the dream." <br>  <br>  It's flattering for him to feel so strongly of you but it could make the relationship awkward for you. I would talk to him about your relationship and that you respect his feelings but do not feel the same. You should also add that it's just not fair for him to o this to his girlfriend without her knowing.|`|06Rlukp7aa	Oh, he may be trying to have his cake and eat it, too. He probably has a crush on you. Don't hang out with him to much alone. Don't sweat the dream, sometimes we all dream about our crushes and stuff like that.|`|AA11525565	Yup, what's weird is that no one has exactly said what they will do or want.  Doesn't sound like he's said he want to be with you, just that he has feelings for you.  You haven't told him what you want.  He has a girlfriend, and he's saying he has feelings for you.  Remember that he's probably having sex with his girlfriend.  So, if you wish to start a weird sexual distant three way partnership you need to make sure all parties are checked out for stds.  Plain and simple.  Don't let his weirdness put your health in jeopardy.  You seem like a really caring person.  Hope that helps.  If not, I apologize for the bluntness.
Pg3M8EvNaa	In your state, the parent would generally have to be absent for 3-6 months, without expressing intent to return or providing child support, in order to terminate parental rights (under Texas Family Code Ann. 161.001).<br>  <br>  And the boyfriend would have to be considered your child's step-parent in your state to adopt the child.
OtKCAeQZaa	Let her read this .Life is what you make out of it, true Joy or sadness. For with sadness comes desperation and with desperation comes sorrow wanting to end it all, I know this to be true. For there was a time in my life that I wanted to end it all. you choose. For my self I have not worked for almost 2 years now. I have an income of about $710,00 a month, the money I receive here is from a disability pension and family allowance and no government assistance,  and that is it.  If I need more I will pray and I receive that what I am in need of , yet I have little and yet I am rich in heart and with the blessing that my heavenly Father given me. I have all that I need to sustain life what more do I need . I have two computers, I have cable and the internet cost me each month $108.00 dollars and I let many children come into my home to access the internet to go on MSN and play games and watch TV. Sometimes I feed them, because there parents do not cook for them or they eat very late in the evening like 9 pm. And have nothing until then. I can have like 8 two 10 kids in my home ages from 4 years old to 12 ever day from around here were I live. I know the children more then I know there parents. They know were to find there children when they want them. I to am single and have to children my son 19 moved in with his mother and daughter 16. They spend a lot of time with there mother so all of these children make up the loss that I do not get to spend with my children otherwise life would be very boring here. I do not go out. I do not drink or smoke or do drugs. And yes I have true Joy in my life for remember Life is what you make out of it . I am stress free because of the love that is around me ever day. and I have no credit card to worry about .and pay cash for ever thing that I need . I am in debt to know one except the Lord . I have no worries what so ever. Because this is all that I want in my life right now and nothing more. except one thing to be married again for I have been single for 14 years. Single meaning no other relationship scenes we devoiced.14 years ago.what is it that your seeking for in your life. what is missing.|`|NroZQN5vaa	Maybe they are job hunting. I'm job hunting but while I'm waiting for phone calls and emails back, there's not much more I can do. Besides, your daughter working so hard now means that she won't have to work so hard later and she'll enjoy it that much more down the road. I think that you told her the right thing. She's an adult and ought to know that the world isn't a fair place. It's unfortunate that she doesn't have the time to have fun but she's doing what she has to do.|`|ub2Dtzn0aa	Happiness is within each of us. It isn't bought, found or given. Its a frame of mind that you have to decide upon regardless of your circumstances. As far as the $ thing, my mother told me growing up its as easy to fall in love with a rich woman as it is a poor one, lol. Of course its not that easy when your young and romantic at heart.|`|HGRBtDIiaa	i don't think you were wrong. many people who are really rich aren't really all that happy.  i think that if you are doing something that you love doing and have close family and friends then you'll be happier that if you were filthy rich.|`|xGshAiXOaa	Hopefully I'm not the only one that sees the contradiction here.<br>  <br>  Work hard for what you want... but if you don't you can still be happy.<br>  <br>  Tell her to work hard and get the things she wants out of life the right way.|`|875b9562d8defd3804154e34c3bf5ea4aa	She's a little dramatic. Why is she so worried about other people? You are right in what you told her. The people that seem like they are the most happy are the people who have love in their lives. The people that do not lie, cheat and steal to get what they want. Money isn't everything, and it can't make you happy. <br>  Why is your daughter so worried about other people, and what is fair or not. Life isn't fair and she needs to learn to worry about herself, and try to make herself happy.|`|Xj1l4vRJaa	Happiness is a reward that comes to different people at different times.<br>  <br>  Is home ownership important to your daughter? Then she should keep doing what she is.<br>  <br>  If her neighbors are happy to sit around playing cards all day, then so be it. They're never going to progress in life, and your daughter is making a huge investment that really does pay off in the long run.<br>  <br>  This isn't a politics issue, this is an issue of personal conviction and the need for satisfaction in one's life.<br>  <br>  Some people are perfectly happy never getting anywhere, never leaving a mark, never having anything to pass on to their children, and that's probably good for them, because they won't pass that down to another generation(Darwin effect, anyone?) But others strive for success, and honestlty, the reward comes after you've worked hard, after you've struggled, after you've grown from the experience, pushed yourself to your limitations... That's when the satisfaction, the happiness comes in.<br>  <br>  Don't judge your personal achievements, or your ability to be happy by comparing to others, I don't care who you are, you're always going to feel like a loser. Think about your personal goals, what's important to you, and think about what you're doing to get there. As long as you're making positive progress towards that, you've got something to be happy about.<br>  <br>  I personally have been struggling to right myself financially since separating with my ex-wife, she was underhanded and unfaithful to me, and left me somewhat rather devastated; but I have goals, I have set realistic timelines and points at which I will achieve these goals. And as I work through them, as I gradually get everything fixed in my life... It's rewarding.<br>  <br>  Do I have friends who drink every weekend? Who waste all their free time? Who don't take work or finances seriously? Sure I do, I'm in California, we're full of lazy idiots out here, and our state is probably about the most financially messed up in the country(We're the only state brinking bankruptcy.) So, I know what it's like to be frustrated with others who seem to have it so easy. Just remember that taking these hard steps towards one's future is the most important thing that can be done, and it will pay off in the longrun.|`|u2xm5RoQaa	her biggest problem is shes working two jobs and a single mother.you told her the right thing after all youve been there done that. tell her to go to the jim thorp building and take some state test in that way she may pass and get where she has one job. as for me i got fired in september its febuary now and im still looking for a job,but im able to get by the grace of god.tell her to give all her problems to him and she will be blessed.but you did the right thing,just tell her to tithe more in church and then she'll be able to do some fun.and remeber tithing is only 10%.|`|vUOJ6QWBaa	i think you were right, but it sound like see needs to stop and smell the roses, she seems to be doing good but at what cost?  whats the point of working so hard if your not going to enjoy life?|`|ZRityMV8aa	how does she know they are happy?  it's a stupid assumption to say they are happy.|`|AA12127714	hard work did pay off until Obama got elected...all these so called carefree happy people she sees on the way to her jobs don't have a clue what it feels like to be independent and proud of your achievements because the government takes care of them.<br>  <br>  a person can feel rich in poverty only if they are generous towards other people in any way they can,by helping out or lending a shoulder,ect...<br>  one can feel rich being poor if they don't wait for a hand out from the government.<br>  your daughter is rich not only monentary but in wisdom and pride for her accomplishments...|`|NB4h4jTyaa	People who collect unemployment have paid into the system by working. It's hardly enough to live on, and if people are choosing to laze about, that's their choice. <br>  <br>  It was also your daughter's choice to buy a home that she couldn't easily afford with one job. Times are hard, but things weren't so great in 2007, either. <br>  <br>  Really, she should be counting her blessings - not worrying about what she perceives others as doing. She should be glad that she was able to secure 2 jobs when many people can't get 1 job.|`|FtyLwqR5aa	You are so correct.|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	Yes.  You are wrong to tell your daughter anything.  She is a homeowner working two jobs to keep her home and is a model citizen for trying to keep her obligations.<br>  <br>  She can hold any opinion she wants about this.|`|fHfVRcqbaa	You should have your daughter thank her new president.  She has been working hard to pay for her home, and now with the new stimulus plan, she can pay for her neighbors homes as well.  Of course those people feel rich, they are being rewarded for playing cards in their backyard while your daughter works her butt off.|`|aSSXt6tlaa	america....  the home of the dream.  what is wrong with renting and just beging happy....nothing.  <br>  People make themselves out to be as happy as they are right now.|`|48e54c6394da5ea92d90b07084568dcfaa	Poverty isn`t the best place to live. Maybe she doesn`t like the idea and she`s right. Hard working isn`t a plague, but doing it with a sense of fulfillness not as slavery is what makes you happy. Both of you are right and wrong. You don`t have to be poor to be happy and you don`t have to kill yourself working either. Harmonizing work and self-fulfilling is very important. Nothing wrong with hard work, nothing wrong with being happy. For now she has to do it, but complains will not help!. But feeling blessed for what she has will, and that feeling makes people enjoy whaterver they`re doing..in the right way.|`|OBCvewW2aa	I agree with you.  I'm blessed not to be rich.  If I were, I'd constantly be worrying about my money: where it is, how to spend it, who to invest it with.  Look at those poor people in Palm Beach.  Since Bernie Madoff, they can barely afford their Paris vacations.  Must be rough.  I'm glad I never got used to that kind of life.
zDmGngXVaa	Your dad needs help!!  My dad did all this kind of stuff too. We talked him into going to rehab and counseling.  He's doing a lot better now! Been sober for 5 years and works his butt off to support himself and his youngest daughter now!|`|tao83sDxaa	how did you get to be so grown up when your dad isn't? i hate to say this but in order to stop what is going on you have got to talk to your mom, i'll bet she suspects things and if you go to her you might be able to figure out what to do about dad. your dad is a spoiled brat, who wants his own way. you have got to put a stop to his stealing and you can't stop the drinking. my husband did the same thing, he would steal antiques from my mom and i in order to have enough money to drink. i was an enabler and didn't know how to deal with his actions. one day i cane back in the house and the phone was ringing, it was the bank that we had our mortage with, my husband was writing checks against the equity of the house, boy did i blow. my husband was an alcoholic, they never tell the truth. my husband died about 3 weeks later. you and your mom have to catch your dad in the act. if he is using the money to drink on, you are going to have to figure out what to do, if you don't cut him loose he will distroy you. you will need him to face up to what he is doing and why and then you need to kick him out of the house. i know you can't do that because he pays the mortage, thats why i didn't leave my husband. at  least change where you put money and if necessary get a servailence cam. maybe if you have a video of what he is doing and threaten to turn it over to the police. your dad needs to take meds that make him sicker than a dog if he drinks. you are a very smart person, set up a nanny cam in several places. change the way you deal with money so that he can''t find it.  good luck|`|37DLKnwwaa	Along with the answer I gave for your other question. I suggest that you look forward to the day that you become a successful adult and don't have to deal with that anymore. Again hope I have helped.|`|g2JlIuRcaa	cause he needs it.  duh!  give him a break he works hard all day and he doesn't someone on his back
ZjM0ghSnaa	I guess that depends on everyone. But if a girl flirts with you and spends alot of time with you, chances are she already does like you, or else she wouldnt be doing all that.|`|9cYqY6vWaa	No, sometimes I never even think of a guy 'that way' until he asks me out and I realize that I definitely like him.|`|AA11988503	Most of the time I can tell immediately if I'm gonna like a guy or not. It's just a gut feeling. I think maybe 3 times in my life I've not felt that way immediately but then later on I began liking him. Which includes the guy I'm dating now.|`|Yh9Zbz9Taa	u dont always kno right away<br>  it takes time to develop a lasting relationship<br>  <br>  sumtimes u dont even think of the guy in that way - until he actually brings it up<br>  <br>  well <br>  good luck!!!!|`|LCdejroAaa	well if he looks really hot then i might like him but i would have to talk to him and if hes a total jerk or hes bland then no i dont lke him anymore but i can still look ;D|`|mqjZtssGaa	no sometimes it happens and others tell how we act.

3iNobwVraa	Wow.  This silent treatment is a big deal on here.  Bottom line:  dont use silence to communicate your feelings.  Words are far better for that.  Using silence to show someone how upset or mad or whatever you are is ineffective, and makes you the dumbell who failed to do anything other than play silly games.  <br>  <br>  Silence as an opting out of communication is something else entirely.  But, you can usually tell the difference because someone who uses the silent treatment as a punitive measure usually also engages in other passive forms like: mean looks, eye rolls, or pointedly not looking in your direction with a cold stare.  It's idiotic.  I don't know if this is what your friend is doing, or not, but you know the person, and that should be all the context you need.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|6C5NDSBSaa	Sounds to me like she's just jealous of you.
FMjsTCWTaa	Marquise.  That's what he picked and now I can't imagine it being any other shape.  My Ering center stone is a marquise shaped diamond and then there are 5 round diamonds on each side and my wedding band has a row of 11 round diamonds.<br>  <br>  I did not pick my ring out.  If I had, I probably would have picked a round solitaire.  I love the ring he gave me more though because he picked it for me.  It was a complete surprise!|`|vCZuh3oDaa	I love the shape of mine as well.. it's a Round Brilliant.  Very happy with it!  I didn't pick it out- he did, and I was very surprised.  But he knows my style and he did well.  It takes my breath away when I look at it. :)|`|gkb1upi8aa	a diamond one|`|Q3AKSvn3aa	Mine is an oval. I helped him pick it out. Its stunning and the most beautiful thing I have ever seen (Obvious bias)|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	I prefer a princess cut since it isn't as common and it actually sparkles more than a round brilliant.|`|aEpPt9koaa	My favorite cut is a cushion cut. I did not pick my engagement ring and I really didn't like it but I never told him that and I wear it proudly everyday. I'm just grateful to have someone who loves me enough to want to marry me. My ring now is a sweetheart cut but when we upgrade he is going to get me a cushion cut.|`|PBdPD748aa	i was always in love with marquis and pear shapes - they're so unique and elegant. i also thought id love brilliant too.<br>  <br>  funny enough, when it actually came down to trying on rings we fell in love with a princess cut on me! i never thought id like that cut but it is soooo gorgeous on my finger! one jeweller said to me, the difference with people getting round and square cut is usually because in generally they either prefer things squared or curved, and i went home and noticed that like everywhere in my house it is very modern and squared lol it was funny how that works... weird hey.<br>  <br>  so yes i would certainly say on myself i love my princess solitaire!|`|jPJ9MTCwaa	I have a round cut although recently I have fallen in love with cushion cut diamonds.  Just love it!  I adore my round, solitaire, though.  We picked it out together but we looked at lots of diamonds throughout the years so I was surprised to actually get this one.  It was just what I wanted.  A simple solitaire in a 6 pronged setting.<br>  <br>  Eidt:  I work at Zales and really enjoy your ring set.  It's fun that it isn't just a band but something that actually surrounds your marquis and gives it a nice shape.|`|b328a9d35b4d38f11fb5ea37fe0b727aaa	I like round and princess. I love emerald, but it doesn't sparkle as much as round and princess.|`|52e1044b00e7fe6ffc7e96609443787daa	Oval. I adore oval rings, especially ones with sides stones in the band.|`|Ocv4G6Y4aa	When i was looking at diamonds and rings, I always wanted something different- like marquis or pear.  After thinking about it for a while, I decided I like round the best.  Only because it is timeless, I know I will love it just as much when I am 80.  Princess was the "it" shape for a few years, and has really faded out.  Although its beautiful, all of them are, I don't think anything will be as timeless as a round cut.|`|btNUf7rcaa	I don't have my ring yet, but I love rectangular diamonds. I love radiant cuts, and also the more rectangular princess cuts as well as emeralds. <br>  My dream ring would be one of those stones in a halo setting, white gold. I have given hints, but at the end its his choice, and I am sure I will love w/e I get :)<br>  Congrats to you!|`|qKbwBYRTaa	I love emeralds. I am not engaged yet (we have been together three years but waiting to graduate from college next August), but this is my dream ring!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.tacori.com/TACORI-SRCH/ENGAGEMENT/2620ECLGP-A-4-1-100-/" rel="nofollow">http://www.tacori.com/TACORI-SRCH/ENGAGE...</a>|`|YZokRYWcaa	marquise or round. i like smaller, solitare rings. something about a marquise solitare just stands out, and it's so beautiful.|`|cCymTwdcaa	I love Ascher and Princess, but my top favorite is Marquise, which just so happens to be the cut of my engagement ring =]|`|20f48fd2f5814755e839599a99c717b3aa	Square asscher cut, set in white gold because platinum is too dull for the pop of asscher.|`|zHX9tlnWaa	I was so happy with my ring! I showed him a picture of one like it and he picked out one even better. I like round diamonds best.|`|hsZnjZvoaa	My first set just had small chips... it was what we could afford. For our 10th I got to pick out a new set and I went with a heart shaped diamond.  I don't know why, but I had always wanted one.
vyL7yEleaa	i spent $800+ on my gown. it is more expensive then i really wanted, but just like the old saying goes. you get what you pay for.<br>  <br>  a davids bridal dress can run in the low hundreds, but the dresses are mass produced and they wrinkle really easily and frankly are not all that good looking and probably 50 brides have tried that dress on before you.<br>  <br>  Maggie Sottero makes very nice dresses that are good mid range. i got my first dress from her and it was around $600, the only problem i found is that it wrinkles really easy and the embroidery is really delicate. but her dresses are nice. (i have to sell it cause it's from a wedding that never happened and i'm to big for it now XD<br>  <br>  my new dress for my coming up wedding i bought a Mori Lee which ran me over $800 but the dress is of a quality i have never seen. the dress that i tried on in the store is stored in the plastic bad and every time we pull the try on dress out there is not a single wrinkle on it. the dress is very sturdy and even though the skirt has two layers of organza on it and very intricate beading i don't really fear i have to worry about tearing it or loosing the beads. <br>  <br>  so you may end up spending more but you won't regret it in the end. i would find a dress you like and of good quality.|`|zHX9tlnWaa	I bought mine at David's Bridal for $99 during one of their sales. I don't think the dress is the most important part of the wedding but obviously you want to feel beautiful on your wedding day. That was the most inexpensive one but you could definitely find one that is beautiful for a couple hundred dollars or less.|`|IZn53ePgaa	To me the dress is extremely important. <br>  <br>  I had a budget of 1.5K for the dress. I went to davids bridal and tried on dresses just because I wanted to see what they had. I ended up falling in love with a dress that was 599 that was on sale for 549 and then with a coupon from a bridal show it came out to 499. <br>  <br>  I was extremely surprised with how beautiful the dresses where and I loved them.|`|cCymTwdcaa	Honestly it isn't the most important part of your wedding. The fact you are marrying the person you love, and celebrating that love and union with your nearest and dearest is.<br>  <br>  I only planned to spend around $100-200, but found my dream dress on sale for $349 and had the extra wiggle room in our small budget to afford it, so I went for it. <br>  <br>  I would recommend you checking eBay, Amazon, JCrew, GroupUSA, prom shops (they have some gorgeous stuff at very reasonable prices), even David's Bridal can provide some good options, etc.<br>  <br>  I would also recommend you checking into OffbeatBride.com. it's an amazing, creative website that offers inspiration and great ideas for budget weddings.|`|FMjsTCWTaa	$75 off of eBay.  It was worn once but it was cleaned.  I'll have it cleaned too though.  It is beautiful and it fits perfect so no alterations needed.  It's a $650 David's Bridal dress!  <br>  <br>  Finding a nice dress was important to me but I didn't want to spend $1,000 on one.  It's not the MOST important part to me so I decided to just check out eBay and I am so happy that I did.  Maybe you could find a dress there?|`|xwZPQ72naa	I got my dress from Davids Bridal. They have sales going on all the time with a huge selection of dresses in every price range. My dress was originally $600 but we found out it was a discontinued dress so we got it for $300 and got to take it home that day. They also do a cleaning of the dress a few weeks before the wedding. I would definitely try Davids Bridal first and then go from there. <br>  <br>  You could also buy a dress online for cheaper, usually around 40% off. The only problem is you don't know what it looks like on you before you buy it. <br>  Here are some websites: www.Netbride.com<br>  www.Pearlsplace.com<br>  www.BargainWeddingGowns.com<br>  www.RKBridal.com <br>  www.Angeri.com<br>  Most of these sell designer dresses<br>  <br>  Another option is ebay, you can get brand new dresses. There are a lot of online only bridal shops that offer great deals on ebay. <br>  <br>  You could also use your moms dress, or if she will let you, you can use her dress to help you create a new dress of your own. Sew a dress yourself while using your moms dress as inspiration or even using bits and pieces if she will let you. <br>  <br>  Hope these help! Good luck!|`|xJdtouK0aa	My mom spent almost 1600$ on mine. That was because we had to put a rush on it, and then with all the taxes included.

I found an amazing Maggie Sottero at a bridal shop and they wanted $1800 for it. My mom and I went to another shop down the road and found the same dress on sale for $599 from 1200! I know its a bit much but it was a killer deal and I just love my dress!|`|7JFUiBoKaa	I paid 500 for mine at a bridal shop. They usually carry after market and/or clearance.

I say this only because the memories (being the photos) of your wedding will last forever - you will see them in many many years time, your children, your grandchildren etc and what is most memorable is the beautiful amazing bridal dress you once wore.<br>  <br>  i am eloping in a rainforest by a waterfall with my fiance, we are having photos on secluded beaches and i am most definately still going to be wearing a beautiful bridal dress because i know the memories of this day are going to be the most treasured (we are having professional photography).<br>  <br>  i think on average maybe $800us - $1000us you'd be able to pick up a really beautiful dress for a good quality. but really, if your low budget you could go under that, you just need to shop around and find the right one for you. go to different suburbs and try on things you never thought you would! i was lucky because the lady working at the bridal shop told me to try on my dress - i actually wouldnt have picked it! when you have the right one you just know it. straight away. you wont look anywhere else!|`|2o3BHgCCaa	1 The dress is not the most important part of the wedding, the marriage is. Though it is important to look beautiful as you will have your happy memories and photos for the rest of your life<br>  <br>  2 My wedding dress cost AU$2300 (US$1400), much more than I wanted to spend, but still $1000 under retail for that dress.<br>  <br>  3 You can get secondhand dresses for about $100 for good quality ones off ebay, some haven't even been worn! Or (if you are american) there are many around the $500 - $700 mark that are good quality material and design, but don't have the extra cost of a designer name. In Australia good quality starts at about $1500.<br>  <br>  Try:<br>  <a href="http://www.bestbridalprices.com/wedding-dresses-and-designer-wedding-gowns-mori-lee-wedding-dresses-c-1_42.html?showall=yes&sort=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.bestbridalprices.com/wedding-...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.bestbridalprices.com/wedding-dresses-and-designer-wedding-gowns-joli-wedding-dresses-c-1_574.html?showall=yes&sort=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.bestbridalprices.com/wedding-...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.bestbridalprices.com/wedding-dresses-and-designer-wedding-gowns-maggie-sottero-destinations-wedding-dresses-c-1_212.html?showall=yes&sort=1&zenid=2f25dc64b5f6696675c0d836ac76253a" rel="nofollow">http://www.bestbridalprices.com/wedding-...</a>|`|pKzH1cFHaa	David's Bridal is always having a sale.

Celebrating with your loved one and friends and family seem more important to me.  My wedding is a low budget a well but all of the dresses that come even close to fitting me are around $600+.  They are gorgeous but that is an insane amount to spend on a one day dress.  I have 14 weeks left and still looking for a nice but inexpensive dress, I know they are out there.  I have seen decent dresses for under $300 but because I am a petite they just don't fit right.|`|jPJ9MTCwaa	It's embarrasing to admit and about a month after I ordered it I felt guilty but mine cost $1,250.  <a href="http://www.maggiesottero.com/dress.aspx?keywordText=Nadine&keywordType=any&page=0&pageSize=12&style=A3115" rel="nofollow">http://www.maggiesottero.com/dress.aspx?...</a>   Although I adore it, it's a lot to pay for a dress.  A beautiful gown can cost as little as $100 and no matter what you wear you'll look amazing.|`|di6p10Ifaa	Here is my story..<br>  <br>  Went to Davids Bridal during their sale, no intention of even trying on a gown. My mom begged me to try on this one gown she couldn't get over, I fell in love with it. The tag said $800 so I knew I would have to put it on layaway. We went to the counter to ring it up for layaway and found out the gown was selling for $250 because the gown was discontinued and the only one left in the store...I had no idea. They had some gowns that were as much as $300 off because of the $100 gown sale they run 2 times a year. Just give Davids Bridal a shot and I think you will be really surprised, I was. Very affordable and gorgeous gowns!|`|3MDY29gnaa	Hi, <br>  My dress was $449 at davids bridal<br>  But i went during the $99 sale and got $50 off of the dress.

The dress fits me perfectly, so no alterations, other than a $55 under bustle (at this point anyway...might change once it gets closer to the wedding).|`|pub2GLZPaa	My dress cost $800 and another $200 in alterations alone... plus I bought a winter shawl for another $120.<br>  <br>  I think the cost is relative to the person buying it. 800 might be meak to some, or outrageous to others.

Come on U are grown up and knew very much why he doing like that as now he had started making insult of his wife in front of other people....and filling for divorce b'coz of SEX...What a value less man he is..<br>  <br>  Clear the this with him ask him what performance he need from u in spite of doing all this to him...<br>  <br>  OR leave him SEX is not what at all a partner need|`|YuVSDBkzaa	That sounds horrible. It's the one thing bad about saving yourself for marriage. I still am a strong supporter of saving one's virginity, but you have to be careful. The Bible does say, "my people parish for lack of knowledge". If I was in your shoes, I would learn everything I could about sex so I was educated. Either way, it sounds like you ended up with a real looser. I'm sorry.|`|uGN7Lmg0aa	You didn't want it enough for *him*, and for some people that's enough to kill a marriage over.<br>  <br>  Your ex is a blabbermouth and a liar (for alleging you never did anything, and either for telling you you were good or for telling everybody else you were bad).  Thanks to his disbelief in you (probably because he is a liar himself) and lack of patience, he basically brought this on himself.  I don't pity him.<br>  <br>  There is nothing wrong with you.  For the next guy who *isn't* a schmuck, it may help if you make a proactive effort to learn more about making love.  Read some books, seriously.  Whether you realize it or not, sex is a valuable and important skill to develop, and you can't depend on your partner to teach and dictate everything.  It's too passive and it betrays a lack of interest, which should have been a red flag to your horny ex.  I just wish you had a partner who would have told you this, instead of somebody who would deep-six what should have been a lifelong commitment just because you turned out to be exactly the person you said you were.|`|7cjqT33Baa	He sounds like an insecure and immature chump...just be thankful he's gone.  It's a bigger reflection on his skills, or lack of them, that your sex life was unsatisfying if it was.  If he was skilled, he could have brought out in you what he was seeking.  Complaining about it after the fact is him just being juvenile.  Don't take it to heart and start doubting yourself.  He would love that because then you'd go into your next relationship insecure and full of self-doubt.  Don't allow him to manipulate you that way.|`|cdQryr7paa	Only thing you can do is take him for everything he has in the divorce.<br>  Once you have everything he worked his whole life for and he has nothing, it won' t matter to him too much what your sex life was like.<br>  Get a good lawyer.|`|52e1044b00e7fe6ffc7e96609443787daa	Thank your lucky stars he's gone and find a man who isn't a sex-addict and jerk.|`|jEC8Ctp5aa	Some apples are just bad, some dogs are just mean, and some people are just a***oles.

He's not worth agonizing over.|`|rkZhVpvgaa	Do you know, to get divorce such allegations are a must to make case more stronger against the opposite party.  So he must be doing it  at the instance of his advocate's advice.  You can also put up your counter allegations.|`|1239271c3de85dde812326b9aaafb7d8aa	wow. what a loser he is.|`|fMEypXDYaa	He was a JERK! plain and simlpe, and maybe he was less of a lover than he let on, so don't sweat it, he knew you was a virgin when he married you, so the fact that he blames you is his way of making himself sound better, just take what  you liked from what you two did that turned you on, remember that and next time you have a man in bed with you, then used that and as for the rest you forget about. It is not your fault he was not happy in bed, you told him you was virgin, to expect you to become a sex goddess is totally unreal on his part, your better off away from him and if need be tell those that said you was not a good wife that you f**led, s**ked him to his hearts desires and that didn'<br>  t make him happy, he may be some kind of deviate, ever think of that?|`|kRbkiPvnaa	Sounds like there was more to it than he wanted to tell you. He is just using that as an excuse for his actions.  He had what most guys want, a blank slate to teach what he wants and likes. Did you do everything he wanted to try?  How would he know if you were bad unless he had something to compare it to. He may have been cheating on you all along.  <br>  <br>  Good luck, I hope your next relationship is better.  Oh yeah, I almost forgot.  People say very bad things in a divorce, it brings out the worst in people. In a divorce there are 2 sides and somewhere in between is the truth.|`|RuJqdlfpaa	I don't know your age, marriage does not only to have sex, it is to be cared and caring, shared and sharing,  etc....so, don't bother, tell your spouse to be gentle as you like to do and to be.  you can not change once behaviours and other can not change yours.|`|GyMYBIUuaa	He does not deserve you, honey! He has no idea of the "gift' that you have saved for him and does not appreciate it!  Have you heard the song Slow Hand....you need a lover with a slow hand....loving and patient....who will teach you. Like you said, you did what came natural. That is all you should have to do. There is nothing wrong with guiding someone....but, the idea is to please each other.....not just him. He sounds like a real jerk!  As far as him "telling" everyone....believe me dear, he looks like the jackass!

OP8sRCbTaa	Take life one day at a time, don't rush yourself off to the next thing.. Just relax.  I know it sounds much easier than it is, but you gotta just stop and find the good in what you have now..  You'll miss it when it's over.<br>  <br>  Schoolwork can be very stressful, especially when you are having trouble sleeping.  Unfortunately though, both schoolwork and sleep are essential in achieving your goals.  Make sure you set aside at least 6 or 7 hours each night to get sleep, and if you're having trouble falling asleep, try some deep breathing excercises or different meditation techniques to clear your head and help you get a good night's rest.<br>  <br>  I obviously don't know the details of your argument with your mother, but maybe you should try talking to her.  Suggest some one-on-one bonding time.. go see a movie, or take her out to dinner.  Bonding with your father would be nice too, especially if you're going away from home soon.  Get to know each other a little better before you leave.  You never know, he might surprise you.  And the relationship between sisters is an incredible bond.  Some issues might be difficult to discuss with a younger sibling, but trust her.  Open up to her, and let her in.  Some subjects may not be appropriate depending on how much younger she is, but don't be embarrassed or shy to let her in.<br>  <br>  Going away to school is also an exciting adventure, and it's completely normal to look forward to it.  But again, don't rush anything.  Just relax and enjoy life.  Good luck with everything! =)|`|eGS0VQ5oaa	Be glad your still in high school and not just laid off from your job and worrying about how to pay  rent and take care of a newborn baby.

Getting to the end of the school year may seem tough, but you can do it!  <br>  <br>  When you get to college, no matter what college it is (unless you live at home when you do go to college) then you will be able to start over anew.  I certainly recommend living in the dorms the first year on campus.  Also, if you like your major there are tons of people eager to hang out with you that are also in your same major.  College clubs and events are a great way to meet people, and the good news about college is- you're all in the same boat!  Pretty much everyone there left their friends and family behind, so they are all looking for new best friends.  :)  So cheer up and just think of the friend you will make in College.  <br>  <br>  A word to the wise though- picking a college in the State you want to live for a while really helps in the job search and helps if you meet great people you don't want to leave.  Unless you go to a top tier school like Harvard or Yale.<br>  <br>  Good luck, and I know you will meet a great friend in college, because you seem like a very mature and sensible person.  And that fits the characteristics of many college students, unlike High School students.

If he waits on you and his relationship doesn't work out with the other chick then you DIDN'T break them up...they just weren't ment to be and you know he liked you enough to wait for you.  If he dips then you would have known that he was playing you and had no intentions of being with you...then its out of your life for good and that what you want if this is really the situation<br>  <br>  But this situation will revolve around how you handle it...no one else...i promise.   First and foremost you have to step out of this girlfriend role and just be a friend. Everything else will fall in place automatically|`|N4zrkbrsaa	definitely a player this is how i act and get like 5 chicks a month...hes playing you trust me...comming from a player :) THIS is what players do win over girls heart in a matter of days get in your pants and BAM move on to the next women :)
AA11603468	I agree with others. You tell him when and where the appointment is. You go, even if he doesn't. You explain to him that you arte going in the interest of keeping your marriage afloat.|`|lgxE5nUoaa	He is not being a team player - there's not much you can do - you have to accept the choices he makes.  If counseling is out, and there's nothing you two can resolve yourselves, it might just be the end of the relationship.|`|2f2338425d995c6d00e32cb38d57ee7faa	Find a counselor and start going on your own. YOU need help, not just him. It can be a difficult step to take - to admit your own inability to solve your problems and to involve a third party in your family life. Maybe he is having a hard time with the idea. Try going by yourself, and take it slow. Both of you are under stress right now, and, as you said yourself, neither is "the strong one"; it's a difficult time.|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	then go alone.  the counseling will help you get your head straight and put you in a better place to make a decision about what you need to do for yourself.<br>  <br>  I don't want to get your hopes up, but sometimes when one spouse goes into counseling, the other one will follow them.   So there is still a chance he could join you, just move forward with taking care of yourself right now and if he falls in then great, if he doesn't then you'll deal with it when you're ready.|`|AXbdNdPzaa	I have only been to marriage counselor twice.  The first time we went, we told what was going on in our marriage.  The second time, the counselor plain old pi$$ed me off.  I never went again.  We got a divorce, which I should have just done at the beginning.  The judge and the DA asked me to divorce him.|`|4HoVVCenaa	Counseling won't work if he doesn't want it to. Counseling only helps those that want to be helped. Sorry.  Might be time for a "trail separation"... it sends a message.|`|2c861e38a84a623ab4ee8707af83713baa	I didnt take the time to read the link from yesterday.<br>  But I wanted to answer He should take the time to go to the counsler so you both can get someone else views on your relationship. <br>  <br>  Do you think maybe someone else is telling him your the problem?<br>  Alot of times a unhappy friend or someone who gets invovled will say your not the one who needs to go to a counsler it is her.<br>  Marriage isnt easy but it seems like you want to fix things. Just remember your trying.  I would listen to what he needs if you love him you will have your time to express your needs. If there is someone invovled that isnt for your marriage they could be the problem. Bless your family. God loves you and prayers work miracles.|`|y9CgveCGaa	Well, ask him how he wants to deal with the stress.  Tell him you want to be a part of the solution.  Going to bars isn't going to make things better for him or you as a couple.<br>  <br>  We have a special needs child and it can be very stressful especially when you just find out.  It got better for us.|`|0e27a736d12fa17e74fd3387bd95aa93aa	Go alone. Let him know when the appointment is...but you can't make him go. You can only help yourself.<br>  We went once...as soon as the counselor told my husband he was wrong and partly to blame...that what he had WAS an affair, that the things he does are not healthy for us as a couple....he stopped going. I wish like mad I had found a way to continue going on my own now. Unfortunately, us going meant going through HIS insurance.|`|CF1R0TPvaa	I suggest that you start going to the counselor by yourself.  That will get you some direct coaching and will also send a strong signal to your husband that you are serious.  If he still won't go, at least you can talk to the counselor about it.|`|tbJraueLaa	hello again,<br>  if he agreed to go yesterday, he will agree again.  give him a couple days of space.  in the mean time, you need to help yourself.  get some help coming into the home, and you get out for a little while.  maybe go to counseling by yourself first.|`|gjaPNWbTaa	Tell him when the appointment is.  You go.  Tell him you hope to see him there.
IbZBkrn7aa	Yea traditionally it seems like the guy has to make a first move.<br>  <br>  Personally as the poster above said it shows that the girl has some spunk! ;)<br>  <br>  I would imagine that maybe some guys would be turned away from it for some reason like it may break their dominance if their mindset is that the guy has to make the first move.<br>  <br>  But yea go for it. A relationship is about two people who like being with eachother and if something does start, then who made the first move won't even matter. :)<br>  <br>  Go for it! Good Luck!|`|1XmadefOaa	I asked my boyfriend out, and that was a year and 9 months ago:]<br>  and were still happy<br>  <br>  <br>  so go for it, guys like it when a girl has confidence and goes<br>  out and gets what she wants, plus you wont be left wondering<br>  what couldve happened|`|nChu1bNJaa	Do it!!<br>  Guys like when girls have a backbone.<br>  It's called confidence.|`|DFJ9m4WKaa	If only more girls made the first move... maybe getting a date wouldn't be so complicated.<br>  <br>  Of course its ok to make the first move!

XxklaKViaa	Don't get so caught up in the ceremony.  It is supposed to be a day for you and your new husband!  Pick the songs that you relate to, and have fun with it.  It's a day you want to remember as a happy one and that your guests remember as exciting.  Not one that you look back on and thinking nothing but ceremony and ritual.  And you don't want your guests to be trying to leave early.  I think One Way or Another would be a great song to play.  Check out this link below that's been pretty popular on stumble and youtube.  It may be a bit overboard, but it just goes with my theory of having fun.<br>  <br>  My future husband and I have already decided we're going to swing dance for our first dance.  It will  be a lot of fun :)|`|SK7MxFTnaa	We played "Closer to God" by NIN at mine.<br>  <br>  Glad she's an ex now...|`|U3fwQPcjaa	Usually the song that you pick has something to do with your relationship, it relates to you as a couple.<br>  But then again sometimes it's just a sappy love song.<br>  And other times it has nothing to do with anything!<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmYbP0F4Zw" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPmYbP0F4...</a>|`|lg6jexk7aa	Only the "First Dance" song reflects the couple - from then out any song can be used (but leave the more upbeat songs for when all the formality's are finished and its time to party)|`|30R7gIXtaa	the couple <br>  this is YOUR first dance as mr ad mrs<br>  no that is a not a good dance for the first one<br>  <br>  try" tiny dancer " normally its a waltz so one way or another would be difficult|`|rBwaAiYRaa	Mine was "Piss Up A Rope" by Ween.<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfmB-8onoMo" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfmB-8ono...</a>|`|6xXAMwxBaa	it's a reception, you don't have to have "first dance" type music the entire time otherwise it would be a lame reception.<br>  <br>  are you old enough to get married if you don't get this?|`|vyL7yEleaa	you generaly want music that is going to please your guest and get them up and dancing. <br>  <br>  like most of my wedding is going to be my family and friends which are all slightly older to ancient XD so i'm going to have alot of big band and alternative. <br>  <br>  rap unless that is what everyone listens to is generally a very very large turn off at weddings. <br>  <br>  but i would discuss it with your DJ about what you like and what the general feel of the guest are. are they older and like more their age type music or is it a bunch of young adults that love techno?
ab3a357e04dd4e75e0b7722dbefccc6baa	I don't know that there is a haircut that you couldn't wear, being that you have a very balanced face shape.<br>  What feature do you like most on your face.  If it is your eyes, it might help to "frame" them with a fringe.  <br>  It might be nice to back comb the top for a pouf, just to give it a little height and be a little edgy (for prom or something).  Other than that, I think you have lovely, healthy hair and skin..and you don't need any help at all.|`|78LPHvA6aa	leave it like # 3 you are real sexy in that one|`|cOss2lLqaa	<a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_9Zf_P9g6cuo/SWyH_Wj9bSI/AAAAAAAACnw/uVdpwLPkth0/s400/medium-emo-hairstyles.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_9Zf_P9g6cuo/SW...</a>|`|UJzjf1mQaa	Side bangss.<br>  (:|`|NBDQRBvzaa	i really like the first one|`|rWoaRdljaa	it's good the way it is :D|`|0mb5b00Laa	i think that you should get side swept bangs that end right above your eyes and then get layers starting at your chin that wisp down and end an inch blow your shoulders|`|OO0QD6FFaa	i like your first hair picture maybe just put a little brownish streaks and your bangs layer your face?
R10oqvHyaa	Go talk to him. Ask him sensible questions and answer in more than a yes-no way. Good luck|`|gZtTBWMGaa	i dont think you can have more than a 4.0 honey. that would be like a A+++.. or something. but chances are someone like him whos so successful and stuff, isnt looking for a sophomore in his life, sorry|`|AA11988503	Just talk to him. Senior and sophomore isn't too big of an age difference. He seems like a decent guy so he'll appreciate someone talking to him like a human being. You don't want him to think of you as a giggly schoolgirl passing a note that says "do you like me, check yes no or maybe." Plus, you're older compared to everyone else in the class!<br>  <br>  Be friendly like you would with anyone else. Don't get desperate or seem stalkerish because then he might get weirded out. Definitely don't facebook stalk him or anything. :)<br>  <br>  And if it doesn't work out, whatever. It's not the end of the world. I was in a similar situation in high school, and I was devastated when the guy I liked graduated. But then after he went off to college he would come back and practically stalk me and it was really weird and I totally regretted liking him. So I'm just saying, if it works out then cool, but if not then it may end up being the right thing to have happened.|`|2aE0BxfFaa	Don't worry. Schools almost over. He won't care about you after he goes to college. I didn't even read your little passage. I'm a guy and I know. Once you graduate from high school you look at everything differently. No college guy wants to date a girl in high school.|`|Yh9Zbz9Taa	just talk to him<br>  start it out w/ school-related stuff<br>  see if u guys hit it off <br>  :-)<br>  become friends etc|`|Y6YaMR34aa	go 4 it!|`|c01dFL9Maa	Hey, don't sweat it, just be yourself and pay some more attention to him than you do to other guys.  I'm a freshman and my boyfriend is a senior, nothings impossible :)|`|i9vi0AKtaa	Don't do it hun,  you might like him but you don't want to deal with a long distance relationship.

Since he is your TA I suggest you start by talking to him about something school related, but at the same time don't make it seem like that's all you want to talk about. Doing this he'll at least know you're there. If you act more mature than the others in your class you'll stand out to him, he won't like a girl who acts immature since he is older. Don't push it though, if he seems like he doesn't want to talk with you back off and do things slower. Good luck!|`|q0PwbO6caa	well... considering freshmen are "so immature" when your only a year older than them is kind of ironic since you are going after someone two years older than you. he might think sophomores are immature too. but i dont see a point in not trying if you think its someone youd be willing to go after. just go up and talk to him and find out things about him and see where it leads you.<br>  <br>  good luck (:|`|Pirissroaa	ask him how he feels about you babe <br>  <br>  thats what i did 2 months ago i had the same exact problems but only in the technology class <br>  <br>  i actually talked to him after class and it wasnt long but i think a relationship will last longer if you ask him in person.|`|tysVIluYaa	talk to him, its the best you can do, and hope everything goes well<br>  good luck(:<br>  please answer this:<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090226181952AAKw5qn">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|mNCrjynOaa	it could work<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Ap0w6WzW4rOqtFCv3VhO3ALsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090226184231AANbjtK">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|805e7990734b5f0481c026a2cacb6c5baa	Talk to him once
3iNobwVraa	I would say that powerful emotions are telling you something important.  The message may vary; but, imo, powerful emotions don't happen for no reason.  At least not to me.|`|9UQlhzitaa	as a man thinks ;so does he do<br>  <br>  emotions are powerful because they are trigger points in our brains that recognize things, like say you like skinny blonde's and one walks up to you and says hi;your brain says that is what we like.<br>  <br>  then from that thought we all in love with her,that emotion was a thought of she is pretty and what we like in a girl first. The more we see what we like the stronger the emotion.<br>  <br>  This works for all emotions.ever hate something you did not dislike first?|`|e7KoyoWsaa	I'm an evolutionist.  As an evolutionist, we have to re-phrase your question.  What is the survival value of emotions? or, said differently, why would a person born with stronger emotions be more likely to produce than someone without?<br>  <br>  Positive emotions are, in general, linked to positive things.  Things we wish to pursue that benefit us.  Love, companionship, belonging, joy... all are linked with actions that will help a human prosper.  Community, partnership, leadership.<br>  <br>  Negative emotions are linked with negative things - things we wish to avoid.  Fear, distrust, rejection... all are linked with things that would deter human survival. Physical danger, being outcast, deviants.<br>  <br>  Do you know why generally we enjoy sweet things, but find sour things unpleasant?  It's because sweet things are linked to fruits, vegetables and therefore vitamins, and sour and bitter are often poisons.  So, anyone born with a "sour tooth" instead of a sweet one will most likely parish and not pass his genes on.<br>  <br>  Likewise, someone relating positive emotions to positive things, and negative emotions to negative things, would have a higher survival rate than someone with no emotions at all.<br>  <br>  That's the scientific explanation.  Some people are just more sensitive than others, and we've all felt emotions that are overpowering, both negative and positive.  Hang in there.  Feelings are justified, you can have them, but remember they are just feelings.  They are not who you are.|`|jGIcyxefaa	i think so.. i think that our emotions and how we feel utlimatly makes us who we really are, they control us...|`|6C5NDSBSaa	Of course. Its what seperates man from beast.
9UQlhzitaa	one they really do love you<br>  <br>  and second there is such things as soul mates who souls can talk the unheard language of God to or soul;The minds we have can usually only understand those things spoken as feelings<br>  <br>  the only other possibility is  that you or them are empathy's with the ability to project their feeling or are very sensitive to others feelings<br>  <br>  i hope it helps you understand|`|3iNobwVraa	What?  You can feel someone else's powerful love for you?  I don't know what the reason for that would be.  (I'm totally thinking of 16 Candles when Molly Ringwald says "no, I felt it on my leg." lol)<br>  <br>  Anyway, I guess it really only matters what you think about this.  You didn't give any context, and I hate that.  It always makes me feel like my answer says more about me than anything else.  I don't know if I understand the question anyway, so, you're on your own with this one.<br>  <br>  Good Luck, though. :)
5hxWSezPaa	In terms of years, yes it is good. But quality is more important and that depends on the individual.|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	in years that's great.  how is their health?

You can't expect all traits in both partners to match - and these mismatches are the reason for problems.

Some people have to feel like they're fighting *something* all the time, and if life doesn't throw any obstacles at them, they'll look for it at home. It's unfortunate, and it's degrading for their partner to have to deal with, but it happens.<br>  <br>  There's not a whole lot one can do in this situation, just a few things:<br>  <br>  -Try confronting that person directly about it: "It feels like you are looking for things to argue about." This doesn't always go well, and has the capability of exploding into a much larger argument.<br>  <br>  -Telling them to cool off for a bit. Again, this can blow up in your face too.<br>  <br>  -Asking them how their day was, letting them review it verbally, and usually they'll find something in the day that they sort of 'realize' carries some drama for them. The trouble is, this isn't a fix, it's a deterrent.<br>  <br>  If your partner 'needs' conflict in their life, they should probably not be in a serious committed relationship unless they're getting some counseling. It's an unhealthy desire, and it often gets progressively worse over time, turning into something really ugly.<br>  <br>  Best of luck to anyone in that situation!|`|2f2338425d995c6d00e32cb38d57ee7faa	I think, people may have a tendency to focus on the negative at the expense of the positive. As they say in Russia, "A spoonful of tar in a barrel of honey, and all is spoiled." Something that is perceived as a negative can sometimes eclipse ALL of the positive things we get out of the situation; it's not a rational thing, it's an emotional reaction. If the negative is perceived as being serious enough, it will be focused upon - sometimes to the exclusion of a lot of other things. Perhaps the woman asking the question perceives too much sex as a negative, and even though the rest of everything else seems fine, this one issue is really affecting her. A different question would be - what can she do about it? Some people are good at pinpointing problems and resolving them with their partner - others, not so much. If she doesn't know how to address/resolve this issue, she will be stuck being focused on this particular negative at the expense of enjoying the positives.<br>  <br>  That said, it can go the other way around as well: people who are in dire situations that most of us would consider negative (terminal illness, imprisonment, injury, disability) can rally their strength to appreciate, and take full advantage of, the positives of their situation. They become an inspiration to those who know them. Randy Pausch, Steven Hawking, Helen Keller, Nelson Mandela are just a few names that come to mind. Not all is lost, I think! :)|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	This is a public Q&A forum.

Who wouldn't want to get more of what they like? What her problem probably was is that, IN SPITE of the fact she doesn't enjoy it much, her husband wants it often and she's feeling "obliged to" rather than loved. So its the difference in how she and her husband perceives the situation that causes the pain.|`|bO2rzfISaa	Yeah, if a question says, "Am I a bad wife if..." I want to strangle them.

I focus my efforts on making my marriage work, not tearing it apart. When a problem crops up I immediately start thinking of how to solve it. Sometimes the issues addressed here are serious, but sometimes they're nothing made out to be serious.|`|y9CgveCGaa	I think people want to post questions but don't have much of a basis to ask one.

POFdWpUzaa	Repeat out loud what she just said to you, embarrassing her to no end, and that'll  make her stop! Do this only after you have asked her to stop talking about others. If you don't participate in her behavior she can't do this to you anymore. If she doesn't stop trying to implicate you in her little games, then do the embarrassing thing to her. She does this to make herself feel superior. She has low self-esteem and is trying to talk herself into believing everyone is worse off than she is. She will hopefully outgrow this because you are wise to her adn will model better behavior for her by not going along with her little games. It's harmless really, but annoying, I know.|`|wTbObjoSaa	Tell her whatever it is she needs to say;if she cannot say it out loud then you DONT want to hear it.Or simply walk away from her everytime she goes to whisper;because you dont like it and strangers dont like it either.3;tell her it makes her look very immature;like a ten year old;that aught to get her|`|W1lqSWR7aa	Since your  an adult you have  explain why whispering is mean and wrong and that one of these days she could get hurt.If she gets mad well at lease you told her what you fell,Ask her how would she feel if someone whisper about her,it could even be a boy she likes who could be the one who whispers about her.It's mean and hurtful.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|ODJ9YWeAaa	just tell her its rude. and if she dosnt stop just walk away or move away from her when she does it. she'll get the hint and probably stop doing it to you
6X2XLVblaa	Guys always get mad when they're confronted or caught in a lie. So what you found out, he shouldn't have that account and none of that would of happened if he was just man enough to tell you the truth. A guy isn't going to pay for a dating account if he isn't using him. He cannot be trusted, watch him for a bit, he could be cheating or looking to. You might want to consider dropping him. Lies are a horrible thing to have in a relationship, you truly have no relationship without trust.|`|Lz2jb7ljaa	just break up with him not sweetie.

You are living together and sharing a life and it was there.  HE is the one that lied...YOU DID NOTHING WRONG...HE DID!  Don't let him turn it around on you.  You were not the dishonest one there.<br>  <br>  He expects you to clean the house..then he should put his stuff away if he doesn't want you to see it.

Maybe if he had just joined it would be different, but he's had it.<br>  <br>  peace|`|3jqcLj7Saa	Never jump to conclusions. I would try and talk with him without a bunch of screaming and yelling. Just come out and tell him that you need to talk and ask him if he is not happy with your relationship or are you doing something wrong. Leave the door open for him to leave if he is using you but try and resolve the problem if you love him. Life is short and not worth being used and or mistreated. Let alone living it unhappy. The part of telling you he was not a member and yet still is leaves a lot of questions. I see where you stated you was cleaning our house so you must be living with him so be sure you have a place to go in case it does lead to a separation of some type, again I pray not. Be careful and only ask if you really want to know.|`|jfOSVSQkaa	Well if you don't have any  reason for not trusting him and you believe that he isn't cheating on you then you should forgive him.|`|eXpZD0vlaa	A lie is a lie and is never acceptable.  <br>  <br>  He is going to try and get away with it and you are going to try to punish him for it.  You are never going to forget it and he is going to try hard to forget it.  He is going to try to make it a little deal and you are going to make it a big deal.<br>  <br>  It's a dance that's very common in relationships.<br>  <br>  Specifically, try to get him to tell you why he still has a membership.  Is he cheating?  Is he keeping it in case you don't work out?  Is he keeping it because it makes him feel good to have other women interested in him?<br>  <br>  You never know.  He might open up.|`|tDnD7Uqgaa	All men lie at some point but if he loves you he would cancel it right in front of you. Then let he know that he has to make it up to you because lying will not be tolerated. Because if he will lie about one thing for so long then he can lie to you about anything else. So no lie is acceptable for any reason. Also the point of you looking at his statement is invalid because he left it out. He should at least look at it from another side that at least you confronted him about it and did not hide it from him that you did find out.|`|NdqgiPotaa	i like rogers answer. short sweet and to the point. if he lied about something small like that..... who knows what else hes lying about.|`|N1z3ArcTaa	This is an issue you should analyze very deeply. Think about it, he might have forgotten that he was part of that, or he might have lied to you. You should better have a talk with him and ask him what's going on. If he really lied to you it's not worth to continue with him because he can be doing the same with other things.  You have to be respected and if someone is not respecting you it would be better to forget about him.|`|5MuHZnKzaa	I hate to say this, but he really does just seem like a jerk who's tryin to get some with some neither of you know behind your back.

And found he was looking for someone to have a discreet sexual relationship with him.  It devastated me. He obviously knows its still coming out of his acct. and if he got mad about it, I'd say he only got mad cause he got caught. make sure he deletes the acct. and don't feel bad that you found it. You obvious were looking for a reason.|`|AA12235928	He could be telling the truth. Maybe he is being charged even tho he doesn't use there services anymore|`|IOK8qUBjaa	Why were you looking at his credit card statement?|`|AA11579822	Snooping around means you had  suspicion of this going on. Don't be mad when you make a bad decision based on love and not reality. COME ON!  You knew this was going on.  Only bad thing is that you should have gone with what you felt and your suspicions. Too late now.<br>  <br>  Other side is... no other side, just free him up to do this to someone else!!!|`|76MNB4s8aa	You know in your gut what the deal is.

Some guys are never satisfied.<br>  <br>  And if he's lying to you, he's probably not worth it.|`|DlrHF9L5aa	Honey you know the truth, why would he get mad?? Because he lied and is still lieing, some guys are just not trustworthy|`|KjCffRCBaa	Well he told you he deleted it or removed the service because he didnt want you to know that he still had it obviously. And apparently he felt safe with continuing on with it simply because you didnt check his statements. My question would be why would he do that if he was happy with you in the first place? Is he still looking? Is he unsatisfied? You mentioned that you have been dating for a few years. It sounds like you are in this for the commitment and the fun of the relationship because you are clearly hurt by this. That leaves one to think, is he is this for the same reasons as you or something different altogether. Also, he is mad at you now that you have check his statement, this is warranted yes, anyone would be upset, but you also have to think is there more to it than that? Is there more than a credit card statement that he is hiding from you. It is probably a good idea that you get everything out in the open, resolve any trust issues, and start fresh again.|`|Y8UCdHxhaa	If he was billed recently, he's obviously actively seeking someone else. Time to have 'that' conversation with him...|`|am3pMm9Taa	Its a little hard to say you know. The main reason why people lie about something is to be keeping a secret from someone. Honestly its some bs on his part to be in a dating site when he has a women already at home. This is just my opinion so dont go completly off of what im saying. This is your problem and you have to decide whats best for you not him. You know what they say theres tons of fish out there in the sea you just have to be careful of the sharks as well. I hope that everything clears up for you hun and good luck.|`|5328e2d0d0f963d2ddb641db33165d74aa	He lied...Yo went thru his stuff.

One is that he simply forgot about it or thought he had cancelled it, and he truly is innocent, and maybe not so keen as a hawk with his bank statement as you think.  Another possibility is that he is a lying bastard who has been using the dating system behind your back.  If you are to have a successful relationship, then you guys should be extremely open, and if you guys can't just talk this issue out, then something is wrong.  Simply talk to the guy and see what is up, maybe there is some simple and logical explanation that will excuse him, and maybe there is one that will incriminate him.  You'll have to judge.

So if I guy wants to have sex, and you say no, more than likely he will break it off there because there would be no point in continuing the relationship.

I had some guys who fobbed me off immediately when they realised they weren't going to get any, I had some who promised to wait but couldn't in the end, I had some (four) who actually proposed because they believed they loved me (but weren't what I wanted plus I think it was more the pursuit they were in love with), and I met one who felt the same way and was waiting himself. I married him.|`|VYMxtHpoaa	Good for you that you want to remain a virgin til marriage.

If not, he wasn't worth it. With my first boyfriend i didnt wanna give it up to him and after 4 years, he finally decided to cheat on me. In other words, he wasn't worth it. Now im with someone else and its been a year and 4 months, and he reminds me everyday that he is going to continue waiting for me. <br>  <br>  That proves to me that he is not in it for sex he is in it cuz of my personality. and THAT is the kind of guy you need, not that jerk what wanted whats in your pants more than your own personality... <br>  <br>  I hope I helped! if so, please rate/vote for my answer to be as "Best Answer" Thank you!! <3!|`|MWjNp6y3aa	Women want emotional fulfillment and men want physical fulfillment.

We don't think you are dirty or anything if you give it to us we just hate not getting our half of the bargain. <br>  <br>  Women expect everything and men get generally nothing out of it except for a trophy of a woman...until we figure out you are wasting our time and try to find one that won't. <br>  <br>  It's just super annoying sometimes.

You'll find someone someday who respects you for who you are :)<br>  <br>  But just because a girl has sex, doesn't mean she doesn't have respect for her body. It just means she wants to share a bodily connection with another human being. Sex is not right or wrong, it's just what it is. However, the reason people have sex should be for love and love only. So i', not saying you should or shouldn't wait until marriage, because that's your choice. However, i please urge you to wait for once you can do it with someone you trust and love.|`|2eztcCO0aa	In my view, staying a virgin until you're married just doesn't make sense.  It used to, back in the days when there was no birth control and girls got married in their teens, but these days almost all adults recognize that it just isn't sensible.<br>  <br>  Very few people are virgins when they get married.  Even devoutly religious people have sex before marriage, although they would never admit it.  And guess what?  Surveys have shown that our parents and grandparents frequently had sex before marriage too.  There were even times when a woman couldn't get married unless she was pregnant, proving that she was fertile.  That's why women got engagement rings, to compensate them for having premarital sex if the marriage didn't occur.<br>  <br>  You can respect your body without staying a virgin.  You have to be choosy about who you are with and be safe.  You don't say how old you are, but I would say that it's only important to remain a virgin until you're an adult.|`|AA11988503	If he doesn't respect your decision then he isn't the right guy for you, and you should be glad to be out of that relationship. My first boyfriend told me that he was fine with me wanting to stay a virgin, but he would always try to push me to change my mind. He was also a loser.<br>  <br>  There are plenty of guys out there who will not only respect your decision, but have made that decision for themselves as well.<br>  <br>  Stick to your decision and don't let anyone try to get you to change your mind.|`|LZqHQTZpaa	What's with all the anti-guy propaganda?!<br>  We are still human believe it or not, he had the right to break up with you because you didn't what he wanted so he went away to get his "fix". He knew about your decision but he gave it a try and got it as far as he could, until you disagreed in a point that was important to you both, so you shouldn't be angry he's just doing what is natural broke up with someone that wasn't compatible to his beliefs. And I assume you would have done the same, if he forced you into sex, which is probably what he tried so I think you are better off that way.<br>  <br>  Reading some of the answers before I think that yes guys are a bit more physically oriented while girls are more emotionally connected, so as you can see it was expected that the next logical step for him would be doing it while for you maybe it was bonding more deeply.<br>  <br>  I'm not saying that you should go jump the first guy you see because I also accept and pretty much believe in no sex before marriage so it wouldn't be a problem fro me but I think you should understand that guys including me tend to look for more deep physical connection, but I believe more in that you have to respect your body.<br>  Just don't say that all guys are walking sex-crazed machines, some of us can be nice every once in a while.|`|tG3iVkMeaa	I'm a guy so I know what goes through our heads. But I don't really know, my ex probably thinks I dumped her because she didn't want to have sex, but it's not because of that. I'm a virgin as well but the reason I haven't is because I haven't found the girl I want to lose my virginity too. Most guys like to bull **** and talk around about how they had sex and it was great and stuff and that's all they really use it for is for bragging rights. A real man would do it and keep it to himself and not have to run around gloating it to everyone. So I'd go looking for a real man that actually cares about a relationship. And ask in the beginning if it will bother him so you can weed the bad ones out.|`|i9vi0AKtaa	Good JOB Hun!!  Way to go, damn I am so proud of you and I don't even know you.<br>  <br>  Guys have the pressure of "being cool" and therefore want a girlfriend who has sex with them.  Its cheesy as hell but the truth is that if you find someone who loves you and who is worth staying with, they won't care about what they are getting out of your body.<br>  <br>  Once again, me and hundreds of thousands of others are proud of you.|`|mVUpt8waaa	Why would you be angry over this?  You have every right to keep your virginity, just like he has every right to break up with you for whatever reason.  You cant always have everything your way.<br>  <br>  Guys who want sex in a relationship are not pigs or perverts or anything.  All MATURE relationships contain sex.  It is normal and healthy.  It doesnt make you a s.lut, it doesnt make him a user.|`|eSZ4RskIaa	first of all awesome that your pure!<br>  second the guy that is right for you will love the fact you are waiting for him:) it's all good homes:)  just hang in there most guys are pigs but there will be one to love you for all you are and not what you will do with him|`|ugsfuQQcaa	He's just insecure and can't take it that you're respecting your body.  stick by your values girl.  You can only give it away once.  Make it worth while:)  and enjoy it when it does happen.  There is no rush to the rest of your life!|`|6sJhoXAAaa	You are doing the right thing for you, and that is what matters.  What you think of yourself is much more important than what some horny guys think. Wait until you are ready, and then you won't ever have any regrets.|`|niq3ETl0aa	If a guy really respects you, loves you,etc it won't be a problem. But sadly, I've never met that guy. I'm divorced a decided to be celebate unless I remarry.|`|85ppeSCsaa	Nope. No problem. Just the guy wasn't right for you. Find a good religious man that respects celibacy and chastity. They won't pressure you much if at all.|`|nSJtGsXuaa	well he only wanted you for sex anyways. but try to find more christian guys, even if your not looking for that kind of guy, then theres guys who would wait anyway if they actually loved you.|`|EhPRMuziaa	Guys are pigs.<br>  <br>  But good for you for having morals, that's really rare these days|`|Yh9Zbz9Taa	stick up for urself !!! whohoo<br>  <br>  btw - im in same situation<br>  <br>  keep it up!!!!<br>  :-)|`|Y6YaMR34aa	ya probably. keep it tho good for u! all the girls are cheering 4 u!!|`|AA10880132	Well you are a smart girl! Obviously you didn't need to stay with him anyway. The only real point in dating is to find someone to spend the rest of your life with. If you aren't into finding someone, then you date to have pleasure which would involve sex before you were married. I'm guessing that you're going for the first reason.  When a guy respects your wishes and respects you the way you respect yourself, then you will know that he is the right person for you.  You need to continue to respect yourself. That is the most important thing you can do. Surprisingly there are guys out there that will respect you and your personal values. I found one that said that we were going to wait and then a couple of YEARS into the relationship it just kind of happened. There was no hard feelings, no pressure, and no regrets. That's what you need.  Someone that you can agree with and have similar values as.  Good luck and stay strong!|`|oxDjoiUNaa	if a guy breaks up with you just because you wanna stay a virgin and stay pure til you're married, then he's a jerk. he obviously only wants that out of you and he doesn't deserve you if all he wants is sex in life. that will get him or any guy no where.|`|157d9bda7c1a9422e78b9cd7fc414dc4aa	well girl it sounds like you are to good for him to me<br>  if breaks up with you for that reasin then that means that he is nothing but a pig, and he has no respect for yourself<br>  but you should keep it girl, dont worry about none of these little boys<br>  <br>  i really hope this helps<br>  :D
Xx2Iu5FXaa	Personally, I'd probably feel kind of awkward and weird...|`|acdf2a2c14fccbe7a3badc5fa8d3abe1aa	That is a cute idea.  Not sure what to write on the cover though.|`|NS1JHMmgaa	That's so sweet! I'd love that if it was me. It makes a difference from the stuff you get in birthday cards about friends.|`|wh3BAc4taa	I don't think that I know your friend very much, but the magazine cover seems like a great idea..
kRbkiPvnaa	what happens if you have an accident and need help? Your parents should always know where you are. You should be honest with your parents if you expect them to respect you.  If it will get you into trouble, then don't do what gets you in trouble.|`|IOKDuQvQaa	dont lie to your parents.. as simple as that... they will know and you will get caught. so its best if you are honest.  sorry if thats not what you wanted to hear
kih302Zlaa	maybe he likes you too<br>  but just laugh it off and make it funny<br>  or say something that they would not expect you to say<br>  something the complete opposite. that always makes ppl shut up<br>  or if they say something just say yes<br>  and then they will be like do you like and u say yes ... in a really fast not really listening way<br>  and then they will just keep asking all sorts of questions and u can just say yes to everything... then they won't really know what to think|`|TuW7qkayaa	Well sweetie if your friend you are helping with his homework just makes things worse when his friends make comments like that then maybe you should stop helping him with his homework anymore. I wouldn't worry about his friends to much as long as you and your friend have an understanding. Then again maybe he is telling them that you and him are seeing each other. And oh do you like him? You did mention he was a "really cute guy".....I hope i was a help to you.|`|7dEztbMEaa	Ignore them. Seriously. If they don't get a reaction they will stop.<br>  <br>  Every time you say "shut up" or "stop it" they love it, and know to carry on. If you don't show it bothers you.....sorted.<br>  <br>  And if he is being dodgy with you, tell him to stop. If he doesn't stop, don't help him with his homework.|`|WBT8vtLraa	they are doing it because it bothers you... and the point of all this is to bother you. stop! showing any importance...PLAY along  IT WILL RUIN THERE so called JOKE.....do not let them intimidate you....he obviously needs you anyways for you to help him so dont sweat it...laugh about it !!!|`|L3byzh3Gaa	Well, I think most of it is them being immature and just trying to get under your skin. But if that guy is going along with it than maybe he has feelings for you. <br>  <br>  If I were you I would stop hanging out with this guy for a while and let things quiet down, if he asks than tell him that you were sick of his douchebag friends and all the other people and their douchbaggery. <br>  <br>  Otherwise, I would just ignore what people are saying, kill'em with kindness, don't let them see that there getting under your skin and soon they will stop.|`|0d3d4bb36620597a6b1cbe916b531361aa	The best thing to do is to just ignore these idiots. But if it's that annoying for you then you should just tell them off.Because nobody has the right to comment on you or your personal life just like that.<br>  <br>  Be strict with them and tell them that you guys are no one to decide who my boyfriend is and just mind your own business instead of airing dirty laundry.......<br>  <br>  <br>  I mean,seriously.....such people need a good scolding.|`|ulYTAfXtaa	maybe he likes you and they are annoying you because they know something you don't? or maybe they are just playing around. tell them it bugs you. they should stop. if not, just ignore it.|`|InPqgS6daa	IGNORE. Just ignore him. You must have this much of belief in yourself that when you are alright then every things got to be alright as well.|`|vEVtXftTaa	I think you're being uptight.  Go along with it, they're just teasing you.  You have to be able to laugh at yourself.|`|HwWlGV1Baa	Maybe<br>  they know HE likes you?<br>  why does it bug you lol<br>  just joke around with it|`|nk7a56ipaa	what??? you like him thats why you call him cute.. YOU LIKE HIM... CUTE GUY AND JACK SITTING IN A TREE F-U-C-K-I-N-G!|`|d2FJBJ8baa	why are you doing his homework?<br>  maybe you like him like that but jsut don't realize it<br>  <br>  of course people will make fun of you if you keep doing HIS homework, what are you a slave?|`|jfOSVSQkaa	Just start ignoring them and start pretending that you don't care and after a while they will stop.|`|93qmjHxzaa	peper spray?<br>  <br>  jk<br>  make it like a joke say hey babe too then be like just kidding hahah puch his arm and say buddie|`|jIiwb8A4aa	HE LIKES YOU!!|`|HpwevWYlaa	It's school sweetie. Get used to it.|`|DUjr9tNUaa	just ignore it.|`|zWX5GDehaa	they wanna tease u to see if u do like him or not because maybe he likes u|`|6OFHemITaa	Too many "what ifs".   The thing is, kids are so immature!  The more that their teasing "seems" to bother you.  The more they will tease you.  It will be a viscous cycle.  So, you can either choose to go along with it and totally NOT let it bother you, or you can tell him that you can't be friends anymore, or ask him if there is anything to their teasing.  Maybe they know that he really likes you.|`|hJU59dAJaa	It sounds like they are making fun of you.. just tell him that you don't like him and ignore them and don't say anything(especially to him) whenever they talk to you or make fun of you saying you like him. If they don't stop soon enough tell him that your not going to help him out with his homework anymore unless they stop making fun of you. If it gets persistant (and he plays along and teases you as well), I personally would say to him in front of everyone "Why would I like you I thought you were into guys now?"|`|cs4igZlAaa	I think u should ignore him and pretend u don't care what he says or does to you, because if he is just doing it to make u fell bad he will be bored because he will think that u don't care, and if he is doing it for real he will stop because he will think that u don't want him.....|`|rUrlZkznaa	Ok, that probably means that either he likes you, or he is just being a jerk. Now, remember, i don't know him like you do, so i can't really know, but i'd think they are either messing with you, or he likes you. They could just think that you know its a joke too (if it is). Just ask them to stop, and tell them why if you get the chance. :)|`|1g4R3SN0aa	hey if you actually like him a little tell him that you do but you don't want him to be to strong about it and if you really don't like him at all tell him that you Absolutely don't like him and he is so annoying but you should make sure he is really listening k hope it helped if not sorry!|`|dYZomkUDaa	it sounds to me like HE likes YOU.<br>  and if he doesn't try to stop it then maybe he likes that they say it.<br>  and if all of them say it so much maybe he told them he likes you.<br>  i'm not sure? haha. but that could be a good reason why they do.|`|0eNowNixaa	well, they are probably just jealus that you have a really cute//fun//close guy friend and they dont. if hes playing along with it, sounds to me that he likes you. so the choice is up to you... but otherwise dont worry about it. it will get old.|`|ApoPp1Lhaa	infront of everyone just say or do something that would embarass him. like dump him, or something|`|IkgyyPtYaa	maybe he likes you and doesnt want to admit it, but thats maybe why hes not fighting back<br>  im not saying im right tho, could be|`|JhPhYdvZaa	Chicky I bet they're jealous. ;) Next time they mess with you just shove em' off and tell them to back off. Some guys are just jerks. Show them they can't bully you|`|iDi0hWIcaa	They're just having a laugh.<br>  <br>  Either don't let get to you or play along.|`|swTjhCznaa	tell an adult that you're getting harrassed.|`|zl0YHMD5aa	I would ask him out as evry one is jealous off you|`|Sy67CP1Zaa	Get over it.|`|yrza9o9Taa	kiss him in front of his friends it should surprise them and back them off or do something not expected, that's my opinion|`|ONGF8QgLaa	tell sum1<br>  smack um <br>  b tough <br>  stick up for urself

It was so horrible but if it wasn't going through that I wouldn't be the person who I am now. At the moment I'm loving what I do and I do have to thank the people who I didn't get on with in a sense for helping make up my mind as to what I want to do for a career!<br>  Join societies.

It gets alittle harder making new friends out of highschool. My advice to you is to just focus on your studies and forget trying to suck up to others to make friends. Yes I know it sucks that your alone but trust me your not the only college student thats alone I know meany. Anyways like I was say just do things you love to do , maybe volunteer somewhere that helps the community. Try to make a difference and then you'll start feeling better.  Dont worry you seem like  a bright and sweet person they are missing out if they dont want to try to be your friend.|`|58e1b1e10dbc48a33c1c0667b5fac25faa	I experienced some similar feelings when I was in college. I went to the student services office and asked about counseling, and they arranged for me to talk with someone about what I was going through. That really helped. They may know of some groups on campus or in the area that you can connect with.<br>  <br>  Volunteering is also a good way to meet people. You do can help others and make friends.

Eventually, once you get to really know the guy, you won't have to worry about awkward silences because whenever you do have a silence, I don't know.. they just aren't awkward anymore, haha.|`|JHcBxTKcaa	you guys should like to talk about school  people in school and say like we should hang out sometime s because talking in the phone is very boring.

There would be no way in hell that I would cook for someone who was that ungrateful, where is the father in all of this? If there isn't one than she needs to consider this whole baby thing over again, children deserve two parents together or not. Take care of you and your own!! You are pregnant, no need to stress yourself out or hurt your unborn baby for someone who doesn't care.|`|eeaXYyCNaa	You need to talk to your husband about it.  Maybe he could explain to his mom that it is not fair to you.  You have a toddler, how do they expect you to be able to go over there to help her.  You will be too busy making sure your son doesn't break anything.  She has an 11 yr old doesn't she.  What and 11 yr old can't help clean or cook?  I cooked when I was 11.  You need to put your foot down about this now.  I would absolutely talk to your husband though.  He needs to know that you do not like this.

That really will not solve any of the problems within the relationship- it will only make things worse. If you want to make it work still then go to counseling, if you cannot get over it, then divorce BEFORE you cheat. <br>  In my opinion, if a husband/SO cheats once, one night, one time, and feels very remorsal and admits it to you, then I would forgive him. I think everyone deserves a second chance, after all we are human. However, if it is a long, drawn out affair, I do not think I could forgive. That to me shows that all meetings were premediatated and my husband knew exactly what he was doing.  . <br>  Having dreams and a natural attraction to others is a normal part of everyday life.

crxbob5jaa	I don't know where you're from, but if we gave a bridal shower in Houston and presented any of my friends with a sash, toilet paper veil, or tiara, the bride would want to crawl in a hole. <br>  <br>  Let's be more classy and realize that she is the guest of honor and will be the one opening all the gifts, so that should be what makes her special. And I'm sure you will have a nice chair for her to sit in. Corsages aren't used much around here any more. You might ask around your area to see what is expected.  I'm giving a shower on Saturday and asked the bride and her mother if they wanted one. They both said no. So, just ask the bride and see what her preference is and go with it.|`|lg6jexk7aa	There are so many different things available these days - cowboy hats, sashes, T-shirts, L plates, etc that can be used for the bridal shower.<br>  <br>  Most bridal showers now also have themes attached to them - so it is best to work out what you are going to do for the shower - whether or not you will have a theme, before purchasing any of the "tokens" (which can be purchased from most party stores now)|`|1B91qtNQaa	There is many things you can do. You can get a sash that says bride to be or a tiara. You can make her a veil out of toilet paper for her to wear. It kind of depends on the type of shower and the kind of people coming. <br>  <br>  The party story near me has all kinds of good stuff for bridal showers. <br>  <br>  Good luck and have fun.
3iNobwVraa	What?  If I understand you correctly, there is no formula required.  When you stop wanting to be friends with someone, you, literally, are no longer their friend.  It's pretty simple.  The wanting creates the desired effect.<br>  <br>  How to communicate this?  I don't want to be friends; I'm sorry if that hurts you.
K2QwEM4raa	If you can move in with a friend and her family that would be good. I know it is hard to move at your age but many people do and if you are close to your family you will get use to it and make new friends and maybe go back for a visit with your old friends. My sister's son stay in New Orleans at 16 because he was happy and popular there but he missed his family and in a few months he moved to Arkansas to be with them. He is very happy here. Remember you will soon be out of school and most of your friends at this school will move on. I think most of the time it is best to be with your family. You can always move back later if you want to.|`|USsDzaIsaa	My only advice to you is....don't.<br>  <br>  You cannot afford to have a good life and go to school at the same time.<br>  <br>  Especially in the current economic climate!<br>  <br>  Wait til you graduate.|`|Yg2iIneKaa	don't do it... You know nothing about life yet... You just think you do.|`|ZHJuK1QNaa	You need to stay home.  I don't know what kind of job you could get without a high school diploma where you could earn enough to support yourself.  <br>  What's more you can't sign a lease unless you are at least 18.<br>  You may think you could afford rent but you are not seeing the whole picture.  Along with rent you have to pay for utilities; gas, electric, water, garbage pick up etc.  Not to mention renters insurance, transportation and food. <br>   Every time I have seen someone do this, they end up dropping out of school so they can earn enough money to support themselves.   You cannot make a decent future for yourself without an education.  <br>  Get yourself involved in finding a new group of friends, you could try; clubs, sports teams or church groups. Once you feel you belong things will be better!<br>  Be glad that you have a home and someone to support you.  All too soon you will have to support your self.  Enjoy the freedom of that support while you can.|`|ntqVD7Ataa	This is kinda stupid.<br>  First of all, theres NO way you can make it.<br>  KEY POINTS:<br>  You are only 16, not 18. You need parents consent for just about anything.<br>  If you wanted to get an apartment, SORRY! You aren't 18.<br>  Wanna sign up again for your old school?<br>  Gotta have your parents to sign it!<br>  Hope this helped!<br>  -El|`|Lyrc2BWmaa	stay it wouldnt be worth it|`|AA11988503	You'd have to get your parents on your side and find some friends you can live with. I know a few people who lived on their own their senior year of high school, and they made it work but it was hard.<br>  <br>  If you were gonna live on your own, then definitely don't do it. You don't realize just how much your parents pay for until they aren't paying for it anymore!|`|EIY722Hwaa	You've got your work cut out for you. But it can be done. My cousin moved out of his house and got an apartment when he was 16. It depends, are you emancipated? I don't know for sure what the whole terms are that go with that particular situation. But you have to  look into what you can get for your situation. (like medicaid and other things) But like the others have said... it's hard and I don't know your current status with your family, but it's tough and in the end they are all you have. Good luck though|`|ze4Gt1araa	Well I want to move out to and now I'm turning 17 and I'll say yeah move out you don't need no one to tell everyone what your gonna do or at what time your gonna be home and best thing ever you don't need no one to depend on you can be miss independent.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck! :)|`|MgMsMExPaa	This may be illegal in some states. you need to find out. Most states you have to be 17 to sign a lease or  make school changes like drop out. I would research those things and maybe you can try to make this happen over the summer.|`|CSWNU2REaa	You need to say why you want to move out.  <br>  <br>  Its probably, most likely definitely, not a good idea.  They why really matters.|`|Y6YaMR34aa	stay dont move!! i move alot too but im not goin to leave my parents just to go  back to my old high school to be with my friends.|`|Yh9Zbz9Taa	i dont think u should<br>  but good luck if its a must<br>  <br>  it prolly does involve working<br>  u have to manage ur time well<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|ntGOF9Wmaa	good luck with that lol|`|nSJtGsXuaa	with kids under 18 there is only so many hours they are allowed to work within a school week, check your state laws. and if you were to move out of your house in this economy, you dont realize how much rent will be, and if anyone would even let you get a place when you are 16. you might need a divorce from your parents. handling school and a near full time job will leave you with no social life, and struggling to survive, and you less likley to move on to college. i know the independent thing is cool, but consider where you live. if you live in boston, ny, cali, florida, or anywhere like that you wouldnt be able to rent. plan this, shop at discount food stores, consider taxes (if you make over 900 dollars a year, then you have to file) and many people would like to rip you off becuase of your age. make quesadillas, sandwhiches, and ceareal for cheap foods but dont forget your veggies. consider a roomate.|`|vBcqzMz4aa	ALMOST everyday? LOL you'll barely be able to afford the cheapest appartment in town if you worked 40 hours a week. At 16 years old you'll likely only be able to work at mcdonalds or similar for minimum wage.<br>  Trust me, I'm in nearly the same situation. I'm 19 and trying to get my own place. I make $10 an hour and at 40 hours a week (which is 5-6 hours a day, everyday) I can barely make the typical $550 monthly rent. Not to mention food, utilities, car payment/insurance/gas, clothes, savings, tuition, ect.... <br>  It's honostly and truely tough out there on your own, suck it up and live at home as looooooong as you can!|`|n7Ly4nhBaa	if i were you i would stay where i am right now im 21 and its so hard for me to do the things that i want with my income and i graduated high school and everything.before you take that big step make sure its what you really want and that you can afford it.good luck|`|CVNKrrvaaa	ya well my sister is 18 and she moved out and thought it was gonna be great but now she barely even has time to talk to the family all she does is goes to school goes home changes and than goes to work...i havent seen her in a year... dont do it and why would you?|`|aixCXQ8Gaa	your just going to put yourself behind all the other kids your age one way or another, unless your a genius.  and if you really were a genius you wouldn't think about moving out when you so young,  you can't even get a credit card.  good luck paying for bills|`|e4ecc6ecde0e449c7b00bc9bd8ce1f8daa	I would see if you could arrange to live with a friend back home.  pay rent or something.  A relative in your old town could be helpful.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure if a sixteen year old will be granted an lease on an apartment.  Jobs will be slim pickins too.|`|c01dFL9Maa	Try and stay at your parents as long as you can! You never know when you are going to get shelter and a place to eat guaranteed. I would say you should save up some money and move out around 18.|`|QYahxUEWaa	Why did you move in first place??<br>  <br>  Life out side what you call home is really hard tell me about it I'm parent guardian of my 2 little bro and is not easy at all ok.|`|LfXJOk0baa	rofl... aint happenin son
joA5Rcyzaa	maybe you should tell one of your closest friends so you can "vent" to him/her.<br>  <br>  i had friends that used to do that with me a lot and it made them feel better<br>  <br>  but you have to make sure it's someone you really trust and know and wont feel burdened or anything|`|1OxiOk2taa	I am very sorry,<br>  I know this might be hard on you- but what your mom needs is your love. It can be very stressful on you, if there is no one to talk to about it, that is especially hard. Find that super close, always can trust friend. If they are older, younger, or just your age, be sure they will have your back. I am very sorry about this. Just give her love, and it will hopefully be ok.|`|m1493Va4aa	you can talk to me if you want<br>  i'm a great listener :D<br>  <br>  sorry about your mom :(<br>  <br>  <br>  -Kandy
rXCgF6dXaa	oh please,  your just wanting attention from guys and making this up to get said attention.  grow up.|`|JK2RvliYaa	tell the principal & school counselor that he makes you uncomfortable, get other girls to tell them too.|`|B2PW3sUKaa	There was once a teacher at my school who was a pervert just like your teacher. I had him for health class, and he was always starting and weird stuff like that. He got fired.<br>  <br>  I'd say it doesn't matter if his career gets ruined or not. All of this sounds pretty close to sexual harassment, and is definitely inappropriate. If you're uncomfortable with how he acts, tell someone about it. Ask to remain anonymous. <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|AA10953999	Tell on him. He may be a rapist!  Trust your instinct, a lot of times we can tell that a person is a sicko just by the vibe they are giving out. Forget about getting him in trouble he sounds like a huge pervert!|`|oOKsI0QSaa	disgusting perv=p|`|AcmfbJVpaa	report him to the Principal he a perv|`|YohLFEFtaa	huh i had a teacher who got fired for molesting 2 girls first..n then later calling one of them in after school n trying to do it again..this dude also had porn on his computer..lol i know weird..but umm nywayz if u really feel that ur in danger or any of ur friends r in danger..u shuld tell some1..its not good or bad..its for kids safety|`|XUPsK2Nsaa	If this is a serious question, tell the principal right away. The more people you get behind you to say they witnessed this behavior or have experienced this behaivor the more believable you will be. Tell your parents, if they act stupid, tell an aunt, uncle grandparent sibling, etc.|`|QtYrmHeXaa	get witnesses and tell the principle it actually works because there was a dick hole molester gym teacher that got fired because he ripped a kids shirt almost but ****** him and he touched girls **** sometimes.|`|LyZkgPILaa	hey you should just tell the Principle something like that happened to my sister and her friends. she told the principle and he said that he will keep an eye on him. if it still happens then get the cops invovled|`|AIrPtuDUaa	definately tell someone about what you just told us.
oPomvXgJaa	The cosmopolitan (did I spell that wrong???) has a ton of sex tips!|`|IkBhmrkEaa	ok first of all dont read mags ok sure sumtimes they give good info but more often than not they only give biased opinions everybodies different and that means that ur sex is gonna be different from everyone elses first things first get comfortable with ur bodies together try to jus hang out one day in ur home the whole day jus naked and try not to be shy if u are learn to play with each and be honest and tell one another what feels good to you if u have a kooky idea talk to one another and try it out...role playings good and also u can both play with urselves in front of each other so that the other person can see how u get urself off and they can apply it weneva they attempt to pleasure you other than that trial and error kid is the key of course there r tons of other things i cud tel u but i dnt have the room and yahoo wud probably kick me off for being to explicit but the main thing is BE COMFORTABLE WITH ONE ANOTHER! everything else wil fall in2 place oh yea b safe and have fun well happy humpin!
cydakP87aa	he sounds like a jerk. <br>  it also sounds like he has some attitude issues that he needs to work out.<br>  i mean you probably shouldnt have grabbed his phone if he asked you too, but you had a legitimate reason for wanting to look at it<br>  and it was very unnecessary for him to call you names and flip out on you like he did<br>  talk to him. tell him to grow up and improve his attitude. <br>  and honestly i would have a little bit of a hard time trusting him if he was talking to girls the way he is in the chat room or whatever it was and then flips out when you try to use his phone. i mean what is he hiding you know?<br>  so talk to him about that too.|`|NSL9svm0aa	It is so obvious! He's meeting girls online and exchanging numbers, calling them or texting them and he's being a cheater. I would steal his phone and check for numbers or confront him til he opens the phone and shows u but dont give him time to erase things! U have the right to know!|`|y4w6ybr3aa	Sorry sweetie, but red flags.<br>  If he is just playing a game why does he need to know what she lookslike.<br>  The whole phone situation, sounds like he got angry at you to turn it around on you, its called manipulation|`|yoS4cAszaa	He seems like an a*sshole. Either talk to him about it and tell him to be more open and fix his attitude or dump the guy.|`|VJqDtuoPaa	He's an idiot|`|eZj1qCd7aa	go play runescape|`|2S2onP86aa	I assure you 100% that he is hiding something from you and it is quite obvious. He's kind of trying to meet other girls or cheat on you or something. This is no joke. Because otherwise, he would've given you the phone, not to mention, on Perfect Planet, why would he go around and ask about girls looks and stuff. I would be so mad if my guy did that to me. <br>  <br>  Confront him, don't always be nice and ignore it. Also, don't let him to ever call you names.<br>  <br>  Keep your head up gorgeous.?|`|eFGbA5iEaa	Your 'boyfriend' is obviously hiding something from you by not letting you use his phone. More likely than not he has been cheating on you. If you are with someone that doesn't trust you or you don't trust them, then you might as well be single. Asking a woman what she looks like in real life while playing a game can only mean one thing: He wants to hit on her, especially since he was trying to hide it. Wake up!<br>  This won't be the first time. I'm sure if you look at his phone you will find a record of many women.<br>  <br>  Best advice I can give: Tell him to unlock his phone and show it to you. If he refuses, dump the loser and find someone that won't hide things from you, and that you can trust. Why would anyone EVER be with someone they can't trust. <br>  I speak from experience.|`|DlrHF9L5aa	Sounds like he is guilty of hiding something from you. If he is being secretive having his phone locked then you need to ask him if he is really interested in you or someone else. If he gets mad and starts yelling or calling you names then theres your answer, you need to make a big change as in new BF or being single|`|ZgC8uge8aa	My boyfriend goes on the bathroom wall on facebook and in chats all of the time. I mean, the phone thing is on the weird side, but him just asking what somebody looks like you might not need to worry. He might just think that you'll get mad at him for asking and then talking to her.|`|ZRityMV8aa	umm, leave him?  clearly, he does not want to be in a committed relationship.|`|wt4EYPCLaa	he really hiding something..make him see what his life is liek without u and he will realize its better with u|`|eeaXYyCNaa	Break up with him!!!!!!!!!!!!!  He definitely has something to hide.|`|r8owV9esaa	umm red flagg!!! cheater!! duh LeaVE HIM noWW.. he is playing you|`|7d55f425567193e12c84b7b3a430fa11aa	Sounds like he's hiding something, but don't dump him just yet.<br>  <br>  I'd suggest trying one more time to check his phone, or join him in this game or whatever. If he's okay with it, then you may just be overreacting to nothing. If he's not though, he's definately hiding something. If he does, confront him. And if he gets defensive, end it.|`|OuPtLtfmaa	He got to know that girl from the game and he might be having phone sex with her, or something along those lines. Don't get me wrong, if my borfriend did that id get suspicious, but it is HIS phone and HIS property and you do have to respect that (in my perspective)|`|HosRSAnVaa	a guy not lettin you see his phone means he hiding something... you were just trying tomake a call.. yeah people need there privacy but that seems a little weird to me.. and he shouldnt be asking any girl what they look like on the computer for that matter hope all is well|`|ojiO3svoaa	he is cheating
Qxqvr97maa	Hi KayKay salam kenal. kamu dulu bernama eric kan thats why aku kira kamu laki2. oh sory...<br>  <br>  Since i got my time now i'd like to share with you about your problem. Pada saya ya sebaiknya kamu ikut apa kata suami kamu datang ke indonesia dan beri kesempatan sama dia untuk memperkenalkan dan mendekatkanmu kepada keluarganya.<br>  <br>  Kamu harus berani mencobanya dan jangan takut. Pada hari2 pertama mungkin sulit tapi lama kelamaan kamu akan terbiasa. Caranya adalah kamu bersikap biasa dan baik2 saja pada keluarga mertua jangan sombong apalagi melawan. Mereka lama2 akan menyadari kebaikan kamu dan menerimamu sepenuh hati. Apalagi kalian memiliki anak, nenek biasanya cepat jatuh hati kalau melihat cucunya. <br>  <br>  Ok sekian dulu semoga bermanfaat, selamat berkunjung ke indonesia, jangan khawatir dari ke12 saudara iparmu tdk mungkin semuanya tidak berpihak sama kamu. Yang penting kamu bersabar dulu.|`|DcrI9zmkaa	If you "can't trust him fully", then why would you even *think* of leaving your current life and moving to a new country where you know no one and would have nothing?<br>  <br>  If you can't trust him, you can't marry him.  It's that simple.|`|7AndmAg4aa	you should totally stay with him! dont leave him for his family! thats what they want. besides, your not marrying his family your marrying HIM. good lucl and i hope you make the right choice.
AA11988503	He shouldn't be entertaining options. If he's already friends with the girls that's one thing, but for him to be finding all these random girls and talking to them... well you have no idea what he's saying to them. The ultimate question is do you trust him? If not, then get rid of him. If you do trust him though, then you probably wouldn't have asked this question.|`|ZjM0ghSnaa	I'd drop his ***! <br>  <br>  haha|`|L69jZMXQaa	I would definetly talk to him and ask him what his intentions were behind it. If he says he just wants to make friends or something thats kinda dumb and i'd get a little mad at him cause he's prolly just doing it to like flirt with them and stuff. I'd be annoyed by it.|`|5IYCSFVuaa	ask him about it.<br>  if he lies or denys it, then i say dump him because if he really cared about you he wouldn't hide things like that.|`|jewz4KVtaa	Nah that's not cool!!|`|r8CmwwNiaa	well............|`|AhRdm4P0aa	Talk to him, if he still talks to them, threaten to breakup. if he still talks, definetly break up.<br>  <br>  Also, it depends how old you are, the older, the more serious.|`|zCncAPTgaa	call him on that s***, ask him what hes doing talking to those girls. he may just like having lots of friends though, you never know until you ask. if he wont give you a straight answer though, id consider dumping his a**|`|Y6YaMR34aa	ask him if he is enjoyingt talking to these girls. ask if i can talk to them a little. tell him i wont be rude tho just ask some things.|`|FFQeMfFlaa	talk camly...<br>   <br>   Then...<br>  <br>     Whoop his little @$$!!!<br>  And make D@MN sure it wont happen EVER again And threaten to break up with him if he dosent stop!!|`|05b8e574350cb9042ae48f65192c5811aa	just ask him why he wants to "befriend" these girls so bad|`|CtrvMQItaa	dump him. hes not worth it.|`|Yh9Zbz9Taa	ask him y|`|wqV1xnEiaa	i wud be pretty mad|`|8J5kTxKoaa	hahah this is funny my EX is like that it actually kills a relationship when they are too possessive hence EX talk to him figure it out with him, threats wont work lmao dropping his *** wont work you can't be attacking him either cuz he will clam up and get defensive you don't know maybe he likes attention from other girls or he feels he dosnt have enough touch with the outside world mayb he feels alone! maybe hes depressed and want something knew but all of these cannot be fixed by you...he needs time just dont talk to him for a while give him space and take time for yourself...its very beneficial to you both just let him know you trust him and care for him...|`|5RDnW9bMaa	I would be mad, but not show it, keep calm and  say something like "oh sOo its okay to have random friends Cool I'm starting my own group" walk away and just be cool about it..This is not a good reason to leave him unless he is trying to meet up with a girl he meets on aim. Don't let you gard down and remember every thing come up to the serface in other word you'll know if his up to no good your heart will let you know so trust your feelings. Dont Over react be cool. Hope this helded you.|`|0yLUyCY0aa	Confront him about it....make sure he doesn't know these girls at all .. make sure he didn't go to preschool with them or something totally wacko where he might actually know them....once he sees your concerned he'll quit...if he doesn't quit..threaten.....and if he still does it follow through and breakup...if you keep threatening and never do it the problem will never be solved so if he keeps it up after you confront him DUMP HIM!|`|v08bg6inaa	his intentions maybe bad or innocent but it's not like he is cheating on you... add the girls he added and ask them what he said to them. then bring it up and bring up there names, if he admits to being unfaithful... at least he's being honest with you|`|HzEtvI7gaa	my best guess's are he's losing interst in you in which case you got to fight for him, or he wants to make you jelious cause you talk to too many guys|`|fHgo950Zaa	i would NOT be happy with him.<br>  even if he had no intention of doing anything or being a man slut with them.<br>  but really, if it bugs you, you should talk to him and tell him your not okay with it.|`|x9tOi7g7aa	Pssh..They are just eye candy probably who cares.Let him add all the girls he wants.As long as he doesn't cheat.As soon as he cheats drop him like there's no tomorrow|`|2TaAScEiaa	i would think that he was still lookin around didnt realy care and was just playing player!!!....|`|FOyNZfeBaa	IDK

If she does, then up the flirt a bit and if you get a chance alone with her or see an opportune moment, then just ask her for her digits or do my trick.  I'll write a text on my phone that says "you should give me your number" and then i let the screen go black and I pretend that I got some funny text and tell the girl to check it out.  Every single time I've used it the girl giggles and gives me her number.  Or you could do the flirt idea in a group and find out if she has a myspace or facebook and start private messaging her and lead the conversation to getting her number.  Or you could simply tell your friend that is a girl to put in a good word for you and get you the hookup.  To get her to go to the party, just tell your friend she should bring the hot chick along.  Not in those exact words though lol.|`|XnEnelsBaa	Tell your friend about the party and ask her if her friend would like to come as you like her. Most girls enjoy a little bit of matchmaking!<br>  <br>  If she comes to the party, she probably likes you so you have a better chance to ask her out. Remember if you have a chance to get her number, make sure you get it. Don't phone straight away let her miss you and show you have a life. <br>  <br>  Most young men are a little bit wimpish when asking girls out! Be a MAN, try and show some confidence and leadership. You can chat to your friend does her friend like films or bowling for example. You tell her where you are going on the date!|`|DlrHF9L5aa	Invite her to the party, pass the word around everyone loves a good party!!

Otherwise, she'd be more subtle.|`|XyW61gukaa	yeah she's into you or else she wouldn't be trying to do all those things with you and as time moves on she is going to become more attached XD!!!|`|26669f79ff268e870aed960f8814ae6eaa	Dude, she is way into you but you still need to tread carefully. Don't get too confident. Next time you talk to her, see if she looks at you in your eyes when you are looking into hers. If she looks away, she is nervous. If she holds your stare, then try stop talking and continue looking. If she still keeps holding the stare ... well, this would be a good time.|`|wt4EYPCLaa	she is so into you|`|VmSKQ40Caa	You have asked this before...the answer is obvious|`|9ionkBvuaa	yeah she seems to like you,<br>  <br>  and i kinda just like look at him a lot.<br>  haha.

JsqP69mwaa	For me, I have to thank my friend for bragging about everything.<br>  I was probablly the worst student before my friend started bragging about everything. You have to try to be better, it is actually quite inspirational. If he/she brags, just be better at that and let's see if she still brags? IT's actually good for you xD|`|dtZiXpqNaa	laugh|`|ntqVD7Ataa	I would tell her very snootily,<br>  "It's not my fault your so insecure and jealous about everyone else that you have to turn every fart into an award."|`|v0Sn3V9Qaa	Chop off their tongue while they're looking the other way, I've realized that's the best way to silence a person.|`|bkgBLjuvaa	ignore it and pretend your listening. :]|`|T55YPfXUaa	i just ignore them or make fun of them.|`|Tj2jMlTvaa	Well it all depends that's if they are bragging and showing or are they bragging and have nothing to show for it? I mean that's a big difference then. They can brag all they want but when you have nothing to show for it then that's a big issue than i mean.......tell them to knock it the hell off and grow the hell up!|`|ZQmo5Th7aa	my bff is EXACTLY like that. It drives me NUTS.<br>  I just ignore her and tune her out with ocassional nods and mhmm's and I throw a few questions at her.<br>  Just focus on school (if your still in school) or work and everything will be fine.<br>  Make new friends if you can!|`|SJDTElSvaa	when he buys an ipod mini, buy and ipod. because everybody knows that ipod minis are for girls.|`|QbOYIixuaa	I get a new friend!|`|vuEyUbsgaa	tell them or ignore them|`|PumDOQC9aa	I won't listen|`|Mlx5j4zFaa	say something like wow you sure are proud of yourself...|`|D9fd7a9Uaa	i say<br>  <br>  stfu u arrogant douche|`|YohLFEFtaa	lol i had a friend like that we stopped talking now because wen he bragged about something i wuld upp it one lol ..so if he say my watch cost 320 i wuld say mine cost 321 ..at first he thought i was joking but later notice i was mocking him so he stopeed talking to me ..do the same to urs..if they r really annoyin u that much|`|6yOCDAdxaa	I say:<br>  <br>  SHUT THE H3LL UP CAUSE NO ONE WANTS TO HEAR WHAT YOUR BIG A$$ MOUTH HAS TO SAY ABOUT EVERY FU***** THING THAT YOU THINK IS INFERIOR TO EVERYONE ELSES FU***** LIFE!!!!!!|`|EZJg0G1kaa	You start ! If she does it you start doing it! then she would want you to stop doing it and you'll tell her " thats how i feel when you do this! "Or just tell her the truth!|`|6HP348pAaa	When she brags about everything I just ignore her. And if that doesn't work out, I just tell her to stop. I mean, she's my friend, she will understand.|`|2Ltc1dAwaa	I would put her in her place.<br>  Start bragging about something better when she brags, and cut her off. Give her a taste of her own medicine!!!|`|xO9HeDWCaa	Become the best actor you can be and pretend you don't even hear what she is saying to you. Act indifferent.|`|8A1m7YkMaa	face them head on, bring them down to size, expose them!<br>  Or you can just confront them about it. :)|`|DkHVtu1waa	I used to have a friend like that, but we're not really friends anymore since I got so sick of it.|`|SYUVcBbiaa	brag about everything too<br>  talk so fast that he can't even but in!<br>  :)|`|VvndTd9caa	Last time that happend to me I just hit him.

VFUeemgxaa	I think it's a great decision. A phone is a tool anyways, not a toy. :o)|`|pAyl6M1faa	i hate texting.|`|7AndmAg4aa	well just dont have important conversations when you are working or at school. then you wont be as anxious.|`|a4fb671bdeb9d97a5ca6b59c2e09d198aa	I act the same way sometimes... especially when I am waiting for a particular friend who is the person I txt most now!!<br>  <br>  Definitely do what you are doing. Sometimes you need to just cut yourself off and focus.|`|BO28Mn8haa	i think it's good for you. instead of being anxious you can be productive. good job|`|3BW6my5jaa	wow dude your brave|`|hRNpGnktaa	you're texting someone you like aren't you?<br>  Be patient, Imagine youre in their situation.<br>  They might be busy or not notice thier phone.<br>  You cant always suggest the worse like their ignoring you<br>  Just fricking wait!<br>  Patience is a virtue. Consider thier situation not just your own|`|XbhDyCsBaa	Ugh, I hate it! My cousin does that all the time! He asks me when I'm free. I tell him, and he never responds! And sometimes for important things too! It really bothers me. I feel like I want to text them one more time to ask again, but I don't want to seem pushy or desperate.|`|IlSGU9Yzaa	I get like that when I texted a girl I liked. I told her I wanted to have sex with her. 30 mins go by w/o a response. Killinak me. But she texted back favorably. But those 30 mins was, wow. (And I meant killin me up there)|`|ze4Gt1araa	Yeah I sometimes feel like that but no I wouldn't turn off my phone I'll just hide it some where or just have it by your side and not look at do things that will keep your mind occupied.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck! :)|`|mVUpt8waaa	Judging my the answers here, its a miracle how people managed before cell phones were around.|`|pE5E5L5naa	i do get anxious, but it feels so good when they reply, its when they don't reply that i get angry|`|7ciDto6Daa	Yeah I get really anxious when I waitt for my bf to respond. <br>  It sucks :[|`|K0PNbcjYaa	i get that all the time!<br>  lol i find myself looking at my phone constantly!|`|niq3ETl0aa	I used to! You know how I fixed it? I refused to call people or text them when I was feeling really needy and only when i was casual, relaxed and could care less if they answered. It helped me. I don't think the problem is your PHONE it is you. BUT, until you get a grip, yeah. Turn the damn thing off. You'll feel so much better! Maybe it's what you need to get back to knowing the wonderful person that is YOU> The only drawback, is you should record a msg that states what you're doing or some signal if it's an emergency so people don't think you're blowing them off and you lose all your friend.s|`|qAHAb5RRaa	I absolutely get like this. lol at the moment im avoiding science homework while waiting for my boyfriend to text back! So I am averting my attention to your question. You lucky duck!<br>  I would say that's a very healthy habit but an even healthier habit would be to learn to deal with it. Sometimes you will need to be open for a conversation, whatever the reason may be. I would say we both need to practice prioritizing. Putting school first, texting next which corresponds with Yahoo! Answers. <br>  Multi-tasking is such a valuable and useful source that is really important to be good at. <br>  Time to do science!|`|u9GQRbhvaa	Totally, that's a brilliant idea and i am proud of you for doing that. Don't let ANYTHING get in your way of doing school work or anything important, use the texting to motivate you to finish.  cheers|`|ivejg4whaa	I can relate. I think what you're doing is a great idea. It's better to concentrate on what's important (work and studying) than to have your panties in a knot waiting for something!|`|wMTCKqgGaa	it does happen to me too<br>  awesome observation!<br>  <br>  answer mine plz<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Aixm1MF5yoZRoFVldPJ6CjTsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090226181941AAfaUxR">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|2YmCCr82aa	I get really nervous but there is no reason to keep your phone off just leave it across the room.|`|EfpnRLyUaa	yes, i get anxious if someone doesn't reply straight away, dont worry, its normal|`|q8ZEWy7Xaa	yea same here lol but i dont like to admit it
wBcbKf5Jaa	I'd say that he probably has an interest in that girl and he is coming up with an excuse to keep you as well, but that's just my thought on it.  You never know, maybe he really was just rewarding her for doing well, but I highly doubt it.  You should have a serious talk with him and try to work out the issue, but this could lead to some major trust issues now and those will plague a relationship.  Also, never forget, once a cheater, always a cheater!|`|26669f79ff268e870aed960f8814ae6eaa	You sound young. At this point, I think that you can sharpen your skills in telling if people are lying to you. Wait until you see your friend and your boyfriend again. When you see them, ask them point blank in their faces what you think in a very honest manner. See their reaction and make your determination at this point. Go with your gut.|`|DlrHF9L5aa	Movies??? Instead of math!!!!!! Sounds like your BF is fooling around with your friends and that is very common these days, because friends don't mind trying to steal your BF, just remember that if they are your true friends they wouldn't be fooling around with your BF behind your back|`|uQHHVI8Zaa	i would be kinda suspicious.<br>  <br>  but when i put MYSELF in that situation, and i could trust my bf in other situations, i would still keep him, but keep a CLOSER eye on him from now on until the trust is back... if you had any.|`|XkPgw7ZRaa	Do you feel up to addressing the issue with him?  If he admits having feelings for this other girl, what will you feel, say, or react.  Think this out in advance and then act accordingly|`|YTHmYqllaa	the only way to find out, (if your not sure)<br>  is to watch how he and the girl interact, if he's flirty, dump him.<br>  if its just friends, let him be but warn him.|`|PNbsCVNraa	??|`|6j70lgbGaa	its confusing us too...|`|qGZoqAOoaa	well the statement "they could be up to no good" yh they could be but they coudnt just keep a close eye on him and see what he does and then if u w=see them more offten together then u cn get suspicious xxxx|`|JpuWdGLRaa	if you don't trust your boyfriend, then he isn't for you|`|r8owV9esaa	he oviously isnt taking ur relationship seriously so dont take him seriously dump the clown|`|7d55f425567193e12c84b7b3a430fa11aa	The jist of your question seems to be, you found out your boyfriend was at the movies with some girl he's supposed to be helping with math and his cover up story isn't very good.<br>  <br>  You don't have to do anything drastic, but keep a very close eye on him especially when it comes to this britt girl. It's a shame you didn't go to the cinema at the time and try and see what they were up to.|`|9wgyeY2maa	first of all i do not think your bf should be at the movies with any other girl that is not you..even if he said it was like a reward to let her know she did good.. i think he likes her but who knows i could be wrong i think you should see whether other things with her happen and if they do then you should dump him..|`|VXiMtwIsaa	try talking to him and if that dont work...then bye, bye!|`|bkgBLjuvaa	what...?

AA12253502	Don't feel bad dude. Those girls just aren't for you, because if they had any common sense they would get with someone that would treat them with dignity. Don't get angry because guess what. Your princess is coming and she'll see you for exactly who you are. Stay cool and be you.|`|06Rlukp7aa	Yeah, sometimes we just say that stuff, it isn't right or fair, I admit. It happens with both guys and girls. Look for girls who are a little bit shy or outcast. I am sure they will welcome a friend.|`|bYvGNvrvaa	Woman sometimes think that its pathetic to date an over weight person.|`|SumPj9AKaa	they say that usually to make themselves seem like the good person<br>  <br>  and usually they will find out later that thats what they really want..so just hold tight.|`|kXdXJKEMaa	well like girls guys are judged by there looks. if you got to know some girls and if u were very kind im sure they would choose u over the @ss =)|`|3iUE9lGVaa	wow that's really i don't know the word but its very stupid if girls ever think that,i rather be with someone who treats me,amazing than be with a jerk,i don't care for the looks i mean really,girls? i rather look whats in the inside of the person that what matters to me,i mean look at me i like this guy who is sweet and lovable and when i told my friends their all like "ewww" cause he was over weight and ugly, i really didn't care i really like and i told him so it really doesn't matter, and girls should know that.|`|AA11988503	Because it's all about confidence. Any guy who has the "woe is me, how come no girls like me if I'm so sweet" drama is NOT attractive, no matter what he looks like. And unfortunately, it's the culturally "hot" guys who have the right kind of confidence, so even though they have big egos and treat girls badly, they still have a lot of girls who want to date them. Stop being so self pitying. Your value is not based on whether women like you. If a guy is happy and confident with himself, he'll find the right woman to be with, no matter what he looks like. At the end of the day, looks aren't everything. (Or even at the beginning of the day) :)|`|c01dFL9Maa	Hey, the answer to this question is simple:  While girls say that looks don't matter, they actually really do want a guy with good looks in order to keep their status higher up and not have people people saying "Oh, look at Alice hanging out with that chubby dude, looks like she's desperate." (no offense to anyone, just an example.)  I have to agree with you on one thing and disagree with you on another though. Some boys are good looking and are douches, I hate those guys, they just use the pretty girl for their status, like us girls do sometimes (but they do it in a bad way.) My bf is good looking but is not a douche, while he may not be the smartest guy around. Just to make it simple:<br>  Girls don't say what they mean sometimes, they just say it because they are hoping you know what they are saying." confusing right?  Hope this helps :)|`|cHM2US6xaa	Haha, dude if i were to answer that I would have said ..<br>  <br>  I rather be single or find an average man who treats me right. :)<br>  <br>  I'm not lieing to ya.|`|114a9e7f24177ba552a0e5c76a745e27aa	maybe your hanging out with the wrong crowd. most of my guy friends are the chubby sweet ones who are snagging hot chicks. My husband is the tall skinny geeky type. Hang out at the ren faires, your perspective might change|`|1A1ozEaKaa	it really does seem that way, doesn't it?<br>  theyre:<br>  1) lying<br>  2) have a choice<br>  hang in there; deep meaningful relationships are far more than skin deep :)|`|48ZW7O3Maa	glad someone else noticed this, AT LAST!|`|6oM9kfK2aa	women are shallow! or at least alot of them are. i use to be into the looks thing big time. until i found the guy i  am with now, we were friends for a long time and i would always say i could not c myself with him, i no it was because of the way he looked, i got over it and we have to together every since..<br>  <br>  like yourself my bf is on the chubby side, but he plays college football so hes not that big. i had to realize that i have to date guys because of their heart, not their body. he treats me right, gives me anything i think i want and all that good stuff. my family talks about me because they say i can do better but i no that its whats in the heart that counts and to be able to get pass that is the biggest step..<br>  <br>  wait on the right women for u, she will come. don't date anyone who would try to change u. some one will come around that aprecitates u and that's what u need.. when u think about it.. its worth it|`|uLHtXibRaa	Its a matter of taste really..you just have not found a woman who is genuine..the ones you are describing are obviously more interested in sex than genuine companionship but not every girl is the same..you are describing girls here and not women..women are different.. ..i would rather find a man with a heart..and i have never dated good looking men..(except my current ex..whom i thought had it..) i do not like their attitude...or the fact they spend more time worrying about themselves than the real issues in life..but it seems that women too have a prblem finding what they want..so it works both ways..
FSruw622aa	Guys are more straight forward and a bit hard headed.  If there is a girl that we are interested in and we try to pursue her, but she continally plays hard to get, we may just lose interest and move on. Or we may think she's already with someone and so we'll back off.  It's easier to be straight forward and upfront with us.  Or better yet, play hard to get, but actually stop that after a while and give us reasons to continue pursuing like kiss us or leave us messages.  <br>  <br>  See the big problem is guys getting stuck in the "friends" category, if we get stuck there, we feel that every chance to be with the girl is completely lost now.|`|WY7HJDpgaa	yes 100%<br>  <br>  why is that a thumbs down. i'm not saying right or wrong. that is how it is. guys love the chase more than the catch.. ya i think so.<br>  <br>  I'm surprised the guys here all answered no. welll they don't think so. they dont like it ofcourse but i've never seen a guy value a girl (really value her) if he got her too easy.<br>  <br>  love and relationships are 50% love and 50% games.|`|ABRPsjwBaa	No,I absolutely hate it!To me,it's just a waste of my time.I've got other important things to do than sit around and trying to figure out what she's doing.If she likes me,I'd prefer that she tries to be a friend and then I can figure things out.Like I said,I have no time for petty little games.|`|SlR0Cp5saa	I know I'm not a guy but I think it's stupid. From what I know, guys don't like it and it really has no effect on them.|`|V201Rrgnaa	it depends on the guy.  i honestly think it's a little dumb and pointless|`|Q2sy3BGOaa	not at all|`|Yh9Zbz9Taa	i think so|`|SKtmPkEyaa	no no no no don't phunk with my heart|`|6e68ce4ae0cc1fabdc0a003e64178809aa	nope... because we understand your signals as "get a life"<br>  <br>  Playing hard to get too well might mean no one will go after you... I'm not saying you should be easy to get, keep your standards, but if you are making them work too hard to access you, they're going to say to themselves "she's not interested in me and I am just wasting my time."   Save "hard to get" for a guy that you aren't interested in, but if you want a guy, let the walls down a little and show some interest, or else they'll pass you by.|`|ENVkTHEsaa	No!!!! Any presentable guy will move on.  Its not sexy it the definition of stupid and then women wonder why they only date losers! if you like a guy and he says hi talk with him, show interest, other wise he will just move on. Successful men are busy and don't like BS at first - we will swoon you later but in a bar the last thing my attorney friends and I want is a women who wants to play games!|`|rIgqYmjYaa	no not always. It's fine in the beginning... or more middle of the chase. Beginning i like it if they're approachable. Middle then is okay for hot and cold. End of the chase is understanding and relaxed.|`|h0ZdSxQiaa	not really... its pointless and annoying.... and guys dont really like wasting their time!!|`|AA11448812	i do, it makes me want her more|`|kMRf4HT3aa	no i hate it|`|ma0u2CUNaa	secure guys do no guy wants an easy girl because those kind are to promiscuous|`|ZLExTyoNaa	yeah, they think its sexy and sneaky.|`|NAxNWHN3aa	Hard to get means hard to f*ck<br>  j/k if the guy has alot of confidence then yes|`|ixsUWp5Aaa	it works! they see them as a challenge and it makes them want to work harder to get you|`|PXimiZCdaa	it works in high school, but after that it just makes us angry. we don't waste time on girls who play silly games.|`|f1Unp3fBaa	I don't. If you like me, I'd prefer you to tell me straight up.
4a635ec44438b74d7ce28e54d411c447aa	this guy is a massive douche bag. I'm sure you can a lot better than him because frankly he's one step above beating you. Get out while you can hun.|`|Yg2iIneKaa	he is not for you.. Go back to school. Get an education. He is not in love with you .. You asked and I'm telling you .. He's bad news.|`|FJqzKnfjaa	Uhm, dump him?|`|2aE0BxfFaa	He's probably cheating on you and he has lost interest in you. I'm a guy. I hate talking on the phone when I'm playing my game and watching TV. I rather hang out with my friends over hanging out with my gf. All those things me and your bf have in common. But i could never tell her I would kick her out of my place. He just takes you for grannite and doesn't think you will ever leave him and just treats you however. Your guy friends won't flirt with you because you probably give them no attention. Why do you think his girl friends flirt with him? hmmm.....Got to be strong and learn to love you some you. He's having his fun trust me. Have yours.|`|GJ5I4Lgdaa	hi You need to get smart, you need to stop needing him!!!!<br>  He is showing signs that he is going to end it with you anyhow, <br>  why dont you have your own money to get your medication???<br>  you shouldnt be financially dependant on anyone, <br>  wouldnt you rather be respected and be independant with someone wanting you because you are so good at looking after yourself.<br>  you need to end this and not date anyone but instead take your time to get independantly financial - even just a little, then be independant in looking after yourself in social situations so the guy you end up with will want to come put his arm around you and be proud of you rather then telling you not to kiss him in public<br>  <br>  you may not be able to see it now but if he isnt a good person all the time then you deserve better<br>  also stress is an excuse he is bordering on abusive especially with the medication thing, why does he have money in his pocket but you dont, this is 2009........become an independant and strong woman|`|Y6YaMR34aa	I think it is stress. And i think that you should hang out with your friends more often because he hangs out With his. you deserve more. BUt dont break up with him because he seams really nice. just ask him whats wrong?? if something happened. that you can tell me anything. maybe he had a n accidental affair and he is really upset about it if so just say i know you probably made a mistake and ill let it slide but i love you and want this relationship to last. i trust you more know that you told me that. and stuff like that...|`|G4AEHIs4aa	I went through stuff like that. Threaten to break up if he treats you that way. I personally think you should break up, but i don't know you, and I can't make your choice, but I had a guy like that, and he never changed. He is playing around with you and you need to make it stop, or else it will go on forever until you break up. Tell him how you feel. If he threatens to kick you out, you know he isn't the one for you. If he loved you, he wouldn't act the way he does with other girls, and he would care about how you feel. You must stand up for yourself as a person. As a woman. It sounds to me like he has lost his interest. If you cannot stand thinking of breaking up with him, try asking him what has changed. Tell him that it seems like he doesn't care about you anymore. Ask him if he does. If he still cares, he will be willing to work things out. Tell him what is acceptable and what isn't. If you stay together, do things that will interest him. Wear sexy clothes around the house, compliment him, leave presents for him near his shoes. Tell him that you want it to work between you two, and ask him if it can.<br>  <br>  Hope I was helpful :)
6HX4u0SRaa	go to court and let them figure all that out for you they will tell him when he can see the kids and how much in support he has to pay your kids don't do it alone it never works out and there may be complications later on so ask the court to help also if you do it through the court he will have to follow the order that they set up|`|VygBNA0Waa	your slack he is the dad or you worry about is money you should be in courage a relationship and stop worring about money wake up and do the right thing for the first time|`|OL3MUunlaa	This is not up to you.  You don't get to decide how much he pays, and you certainly do not get to demand supervised visitation.  He has a right to his daughters,as much as you do whether you like it or not.  The only way a judge would order supervised visitation is if you can prove that the girls are in danger.  As for child support, you do not get to go to court and tell the judge what you want, he decides based on how much their dad earns.|`|NMFW4bhoaa	Most of the time a judge will set the amount.

cCymTwdcaa	Your wedding sounds beautiful =]<br>  That being said, I have heard only wonderful things about wood rings, and have found many sellers with quality wood rings when my mister and I were initially searching. If it wasn't for his job, we would have gone with them. I know several people who have wood wedding rings, and they love them. Maintenance is very easy, they are very durable (as long as they aren't too thin), and having a lasting beauty. <br>  There is absolutely nothing wrong with you, your lifestyle, or your statement. This board just happens to be full of conformists, which is why I abandoned it for over a year and joined Offbeatbride.com. They're amazing, friendly, supportive, creative, and they all are planning unique weddings rather than following traditions that have no meaning to them.<br>  <br>  P.S. Someone stated that you would constantly have to worry about your ring. Mine is metal, and I am constantly worrying about it! Wood is used to handling the elements, so as long as you take it off and tuck it in your pocket while doing heavy lifting or something of that nature it should be fine. My metal ring, however, would be more likely to bend, break, scratch, ding, or break if I don't take care. <br>  This obviously has a deep, and beautiful meaning to you and your partner, so I say go for it! Also, you might want to check out Etsy. They have some beautiful wood rings, and wonderful crafts people for just about every need.|`|AZcxKGDZaa	What a cool idea! <br>  Did you know that the very first wedding rings in ancient Egypt were supposedly made of reeds plucked from the shores of the Nile! See my blog: <a href="http://maidstonejewelry.wordpress.com" rel="nofollow">http://maidstonejewelry.wordpress.com</a><br>  <br>  I have a colleague who works in Madagascar and makes jewelry of wood and other materials (no website, but I have her email).<br>  <br>  I also found this on google <br>  <a href="http://www.touchwoodrings.com/gallery.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.touchwoodrings.com/gallery.ht...</a><br>  and there are more like that if you search for "mahogany rings".  Mahogany is a good choice because I think it is the hardest and most durable wood available.  These trees are often 500 years old, so you would imagine that your ring could last that long too!<br>  <br>  Alternative is really cool...I think.  Good luck|`|6xXAMwxBaa	nothing says forever like a piece of bark!|`|jK9H6PHiaa	i don't know anything about them but i think it's a cute idea. i went with a colored gem because i didn't want to waste a bunch of money on a giant diamond, we're using the money to buy some things for our house! :] <br>  <br>  do what you want and don't let anyone tell you that you are in the wrong.|`|KuUKggoraa	no........ do not get them. being eco friendly is awesome but really its not a huge refrigerator on your finger its a teeny bit of metal come on! wooden rings are so tacky.....|`|AA10722993	While I love wood and the different types of wood, I would not want a wooden wedding ring.  You would have to be constantly taking it off to wash your hands, take a shower, do dishes, etc.  I would be so afraid of losing it someplace.   With a metal ring, you wouldn't have that worry.  Also they are thicker than metal rings, so for me, would not be as comfortable.  But it is entirely up to you.  If that's what you want, get it!|`|PBdPD748aa	i really do think that sounds like the most impractical idea of a wedding ring material i have heard of.<br>  <br>  im being serious. how do you expect wood to last forever on your finger? to even be able to create a ring out of wood sounds like some serious art in the first place - you'd be pretty lucky to find anyone that can do that anywhere!<br>  <br>  good on you for being eco friendly and what not, but seriously its a tiny bit of metal that will be on your finger to represent your love for the rest of your life - what the hell is wrong with that!?|`|qKbwBYRTaa	Would a wooden ring last for fifty years? That's all I would be concerned with. I don't know anyone that has a wooden wedding ring. I don't know anyone eco-friendly either, and I am not eco-friendly. Since I am not eco-friendly, I do not like wooden rings, but whatever floats your boat.<br>  <br>  Here's a website for wooden eco-friendly rings:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.simplywoodrings.com/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.simplywoodrings.com/index.htm...</a><br>  <br>  Edit: I don't need a diamond from my boyfriend to understand he loves me. I just prefer a diamond and platinum. I'm sorry I am not eco-friendly and do not understand.|`|xkB4AiuAaa	I think this sounds like a beautiful idea.<br>  <br>  A wooden ring will not only symbolise your love for one another, it will symbolise who you are as people and what you stand for.<br>  <br>  I think it is fantastic that you care for our world so much that you would do this, to all of those saying it is just a tiny bit of metal - have you never heard of the saying every little bit counts?<br>  If only more people in the world were this caring, we would be in a better, healthier place.<br>  <br>  All the best & good luck
Tj2jMlTvaa	Of course you should go why would you stop yourself from having a good time when there are plenty of other things that you can do, dance I mean not everyone in the place will have a drink in there hand and if so then that might not be the kind of party that you need to be at anyway.|`|AA11346498	Yes you should go and ask for a glass of 7UP with a twist in it and everyone will think you are also drinking.   Don't give up a good evening for not drinking,   which you don't have too. When I was younger I did not drink either and no one every know it.  If they don't have 7UP then  ask for a glass of seltzer water with a twist.   If no lemon twist then just ask for a glass of 7up or seltzer with lots of ice.<br>  Enjoy yourself.|`|EhPRMuziaa	You should get one of your friends who doesn't drink either to go with you.|`|aXqi9lYJaa	No one says you have to drink. Go to the party and only drink pop.<br>  <br>  But careful, the cops might get called. <br>  <br>  I respect ya.|`|2KC467tFaa	If you feel comfortable going, go. People might try to get you to drink, but they should be respectful if you refuse. It's ok to go to a party sober. There's nothing wrong with it. I doubt they'll think less of you. If they do, you'll know to choose better friends. The reason people drink in social situations is because people feel just as uncomfortable as you. They just feel more able to socialize when they're buzzed or drunk. You can still have a blast talking to people and not drinking. It's ok.
NroZQN5vaa	I think that everyone lives because someone else doesn't. You're just a lot closer to the one who died. I understand that it's hard for you to deal with your parents saying things like that, and justly so, but try not to let it bother you. What was meant to be was meant to be. If your parents hadn't fallen in love, none of you would be alive and neither would your children, etc. Have you talked to them about it and told them that it hurts you when they say things like that? I mean, it's been long enough now that if you need them to not say that sort of thing, they should be able to respect that.|`|Lkik9Sr7aa	i can imagine what ur going thorough. it must be hard. tell ur parents how u feel or just try to block all of that out. ur here, living now so thats all that matters. dont think about the bad possibilities.
jRSzIzYqaa	The shy girl thing is just an issue of mind over matter. It sounds ridiculously easy but it's not quite that way in real life. There are a couple tricks you can use. If you want to hang out with him and be yourself, include him in things you and your best friends are doing. If there's anybody guaranteed to make you feel comfortable and relaxed it's them and you'll know they have your back. Facing him one on one- talk about simple thing and just pretend you've known him forever. Fake your confidence until you feel more sure of yourself. Give yourself rewards if it helps. (I.e. If I go talk to him about ... I'll go get chocolate later.) Eventually you'll get comfortable.|`|6fMDrgWDaa	Sounds Familiar. I think he probably does like you. Start a conversation with him for a change. Get a friend to find out what he thinks if you don't fancy asking yourself!|`|VXiMtwIsaa	Im the same way!?!? Just try talking 2 him, and harmless flirting is just the way 2 know 4 sure! Its ok just let lose and be yourself. =D Good Luck!|`|FL2nfCSXaa	dont care about the ten points so im gonna be totally honest with you. if you really like this guy, you should tell him before its too late. i mean dont come out and say something crazy like,"chris i really like you and i want you to like me back", but just tell him how you feel and tell him that you understand if he doesnt feel the same way, but you felt like you should share your feelings. hey, you could either take it or leave it,either way good luck!|`|XkPgw7ZRaa	Could you be so bold to ask him out on an informal date?  Like just meeting him at the mall and get to know him better.  This type event will put less pressure on both of you because either of you have the opportunity to just walk away if things don't click.<br>  <br>  Think it over and how it might play out for you.<br>  <br>  Anthony|`|b99c02d2efcaf0924dc72f729d7ae118aa	Have a drink before you talk to him :) Or make group plans to go to a bar... there you go. That'll loosen you up!|`|N1z3ArcTaa	first of all, how can you know he doesn't like you? he might like you too. I've had experiences with guys, I mean when a boy talks a lot with you, even if it is about silly non sense things, the possibility of him liking you is high. Most of the boys are not interested in talking for hours with the same girl if they don't like her. And let me tell you, I'm pretty shy too, but if you try to control yourself at least when you talk to him chill out!!!  It's ok to be shy sometimes. Good luck and remember if he is the one for you, something is going to happen soon or later.|`|JlgbIqZNaa	being shy isn't always bad, some guys really lke that.. but sometimes you need to get out there and flirt! the easiest way to flirt while being shy is to make eyecontact for like 2-3 seconds...which actually seems like FOREVER in flirt time.you can also start games of "truth" which is like truth or dare, except just the truth part.. make him tell you his secretssss! its fun and you get to know each other better.. g-luck!|`|VJqDtuoPaa	Guys are not like women. If they like you they usually let you know. If you talk to this guy on a regular basis and has never mention that he likes you in any way shape or form, He only sees you as a friend. Sorry...I may be wrong but thats what it sounds like to me.|`|Fulmgnmsaa	You never know if he talks to you a lot he might actually like you. If you want to know if he really likes you maybe get one of your friends to ask him if he likes you or play 20 Q with him and the as one of his questions you could ask him if he likes you.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped you a little bit.<br>  <br>  C U L8R|`|qroOTyrGaa	Unfortunately you can't force someone to have feelings for you. Be yourself around him and go out and enjoy yourself. If he doesn't fall for you then you don't need to rely on a man to make you happy anyways. Do your own thing and if he chooses to join you then whatever. ;)|`|26669f79ff268e870aed960f8814ae6eaa	Remember that guys are hunters and do not like the easy prey. No matter how you feel, you need for him to make the first move. Be nice, be funny and maintain eye contact. If he does not get it, maybe he does not want to get it and then you should just move on.|`|AA12235928	I have the same problem sometimes. You have to look at him like he is just a regular guy and be yourself. If you don't loosen up and be yourself you run the risk of someone else stealing his heart.|`|XnfkwUtdaa	Don't rush it. Let things grow naturally and you'll eventually open up. In the mean time do things that he likes so you can build a relationship.|`|DlrHF9L5aa	I think that you need to be you don't be someone that you aren't. Maybe you could ask him to hang out if he says no or maybe some other time, then you know that he just wants to be friends. Remember people like you for being you not something or someone your not|`|SyvXEiTkaa	you can never really know what hes thinking but if you just try your hardest to be yourself he will see that you are making an effort to open up to him which makes any guy like a girl|`|6zCalKvKaa	Make a move on him. If that does not work dress up like a guy and make a move on him|`|agT8d1d0aa	just tell him you want to go out and he will take it from there
KDpR83oVaa	Hell. 4.5 months into a relationship he should be acting like a school girl big time.  I work full-time and so does my lady.  We have been together for a year and a bit and I still can't get enough.  We talk for hours and I cannot remember a time where I was taking her home and we had nothing to say no matter how tired.  The good-nights are always more than that.   <br>  <br>  You need to tell him how you feel about the situation and deal with it.  If you are worried about the reaction from him, cut him the slack and if it happens again then question him.|`|67841ed5a773f905fb355783ad71eceaaa	Yes, you should be concerned. Is this how you want to spend the rest of your life? With a guy who is inconsiderate with you? His mood swings may be for real, but they won't go away on their own and he'll always do stuff like that.|`|I814g6ZBaa	He's 23 and still lives with his parents?  Why?  <br>  A guy working F/T should have his own place... and he should be more energetic.<br>  Spend more time with your girlfriends -- like, A LOT more time -- see what that does to his "moods."<br>  Good luck, Sweetie!!<br>  xoxoxo
IT77K1gfaa	Babies need their father, their real father. Even if you aren't around that baby will have characteristics that mirror yours. the baby needs to know where he came from. go to court to get a DNA test, even if she says that it isn't yours. You will have to pay support, but it is worth it to know that you are doing right by your child.<br>  <br>  She doesn't get to say that she doesn't want you around. If it is your baby then you get to be around. Make a commitment to this baby and to yourself and you will never regret it.<br>  <br>  Right now focus on the baby and if things work out between you then great, but don't expect it. Relationships end for a reason. Don't take this the wrong way but a 25 year old woman that has a relationship with a 16 year old boy has issues. She may not be the type of woman that you want a long term relationship with anyway.|`|f58ec99bd12e60acd134f41c8821665baa	Get a Dna test done.You want to make sure that the baby in question is really yours and not someone else's.Good Luck|`|Xr5bU3t1aa	DNA Test for certain !!!|`|lg6jexk7aa	If you are committed to having a child in your life forever, then I would be talking to your ex first and gauging how receptive she would be to you.<br>  <br>  Maybe ask her if the child is yours and if she says "no" ask if there is anyway that you two could be friends.  If she answers not to both then you just need to let her go.<br>  <br>  If she says the baby is yours - focus on getting to know your child first, this will be the best way to get on at least decent terms with your ex as your not making her your central focus.|`|VygBNA0Waa	if you want to be a dad and step up to the plate and have that child with you every second week end and pay child maintance then yeah ask for dna to make sure you are the dad<br>  if you dont want the above then she doesnt want you there then walk away and find a nice girl and have your own family <br>  your choice|`|mtOVRAnbaa	DEF. ask for a DNA test if you believe you might be that babys father...

MTcFC9ccaa	If you're ages are accurate proving you are the father opens her up to statutory rape charges.  If you really believe the child is yours you have legal options to force a DNA test.  Since the mother apparently doesn't want you involved with the childs upbringing I would say move on.  You're not a deadbeat unless you are avoiding a legal responsibilty to provide for a child.  That responsibility has not been proved.|`|5zG0bUeBaa	Id just take her word for it that its not your kid. And if she doesnt want you in his life (or hers) you should honor that.

Many men sit there thinking "I wanna do that."|`|YohLFEFtaa	having sex with the same person gets boring n sometimes it fun to switch it up with a lil porn n masterbating to a new hot chick n ..in some cases the wife is getting a little ..less preety so its porn is more fun after  awhile|`|44taGMNaaa	If your man is doing this dont feel grossed out be happy and i know that u looking like happy well yes happy cause if he doing this while u gone then good cause at least u know that he is not cheating on you thats my opinion i hope this helps|`|NmsuIXd1aa	women watch porn as much as a man we just never talk bout it. i myself like to watch it with or without my husband. it doesn bother me if he watches it with with or without me. who cares.|`|cWmx0J4jaa	it's nature, and some advice?

I have the ability to separarate myself from fantasy . . Most male pornstars are disgusting, and this may not be true, but the idea in my head of porn stars reeks with disease and STD's, and the inability to do anything else constructive to earn a living . . I would not have sex with a porn star, but I've heard from my male friends that I am unusual in that aspect . .|`|wC531TdAaa	I think men do it because their wives aren't satisfieng them at home|`|to2xHsikaa	Theres a simple answer to this. Why would you watch porn in front of your partner. That's a straight up insult. At least when you're cheating, you're trying to keep it secret, but watching porn in front of your wife ?!?!?! What do you suppose she'll be thinking? She'll think that you're not interested in her and more interested in worthless porn whores. Also, watching porn sometimes leads to extra- marital sexual relations and your wife might think that by watching porn you're on the road to that. Marraige is about trust, but in all honesty, it makes more sense to not watch porn with your partner because it can ruin your relationship a lot more than watching porn behind her back because essentially that doesn't harm either of you.<br>  <br>  Hope this was what you were looking for.|`|RN1wGlWWaa	Whether or not a guy wants to admit it (and women believe it) - watching porn when in a relationship is a form of cheating on your spouse.  Its inviting a 3rd party into your "mind" and having sex with that person.<br>  <br>  Porn can be addicting and it should not be acceptable or encouraged, etc.  Its showing disrespect for your spouse on a subconscience way.  Your love should be with and for your wife - not someone one else.|`|hs793CCxaa	Men will do it because often when kids come along (kids mostly are the female's idea) the sex dries up or is very infrequent. He pleasures himself, and porn helps. He doesn't want to throw it in her face, and probably cause an argument. <br>  <br>  We have all heard how it goes..."is that all you think about.....I am so tired.....why don't you help more?.....etc. etc. It's quick and easy satisfaction. Men don't need the psychological/mental wind up that women like. It can be purely physical and quick.<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  <br>  The easiest thing is make your wife/gf your porn star, then there isn't the same objection. You both can get off when taking the photos (taking them is great fun!) and he is at least looking at her later on. I love the photos of my wife and don't need any others.<br>  <br>  Edit edit:<br>  <br>  Why do you say men are selfish? Surely that is only the case if the woman is wanting it, and he is pleasuring himself and then not being able to perform with his wife. It would seem from what I read, porn is an extra for those not satisfied by their wife.<br>  <br>  I wonder if you already had your mind made up?|`|ghz5D5iLaa	It is about the sex, not the people. I see nothing wrong with porn either. I watch it and my husband watches it. It has nothing to do with not getting what you need from your spouse. That is more than covered at my house.|`|EENUWAP7aa	The wife is a boredom and so he seeks out satisfaction other ways and it works.|`|qScVhUUsaa	What's for dinner?|`|66e03546d71298a34daadeb6dce02da6aa	Men have a high sex drive and need to "get off" much more frequently then women.  Even in a relationship, its rare that a man can get all the "release" he needs from actual sex with his woman.  Hence the substitute experience of porn or dirty magazines.  The other alternative is to let the man have a mistress, which is usually not an option.  Women make the mistake of thinking sex has to have an emotional component and that somehow masturbation by their man says something about them and the relationship.  This is not true, its just a physical, sexual release for the man.
8J5kTxKoaa	Ok this is answered by mostly girls but ill give it a try lol ok first of all some guys like girls as the aggressor idk who but some do and you want to figure out how to start it, start with convo. and just be very attentive to w.e. he is saying to you it happens a lot your just talking away next thing you know your looking into each others eyes and think WOW some guys take longer but it'll kick in you'll know when the right time is (look for any kinda awkward pauses ;-) also Don't wear high heels it'll keep you from dancing well with him and nothing is more of a turn off than a girl tripping all over trying getting all flustered cus it isn't  working out the way you planned...its like wear less of a heel or something flat you'll have great mobility and if your worried about not being able to reach wait til your sitting take a break from dancing during the night sit him down have drinks and spark the convo! lol hope you get some type of help from my ramblings|`|o8qbpfxvaa	I would say wear high heels. That is  your best bet for evening out the height. To start to make out session just start going into another kiss and trust me, he will most likely go along with it.

8c7f32d052d097a7718edc9c6a056b56aa	I think it's always good to be able to find someone that you can feel comfortable talking to and letting things out. Maybe a counselor, a relative, a friend. I have always had trust issues too, but I do have one best friend that I can tell ANYTHING to. It's not good to keep things inside and let it build up like that.|`|AA10438532	i ahve been doing that for 55 years. i don't know what the answer is. maybe some therapy?|`|AcmfbJVpaa	and don't tell them anything you will be better off|`|851bf075860be83c579bd47dd0a07b55aa	there is nothing wrong with not being able to trust. Trust isn't something one can give out easily. and not being able to tell your friend something is fine, i still can't tell my friends everything, and i give trust pretty easily. just because their your best friends doesn't mean you have to tell them everything, everyone needs their secrets and if somethings truly bothering you and you want to talk to your friends about it then you will when you feel you are ready, not when you think your ready. No need to worry about not being able to trust people, you will find people you trust in time.
AkUhaMm9aa	I dont  see the point either and honestly im not having one..well my wedding is small and i only have a MOH (my sister) and my fiances best friend will be the best man..even our rehearsal will be quick.. what I really want to do is hang out at home with my family and then rest for the next day..no need for that in my case.. I agree you need a rehersal.. but not a rehersal dinner or party afterwards...<br>  <br>  why is this a way of celebrating your upcoming wedding? whats the engagement and the showers and the bachelor parties for....this is how you add up cost to your wedding...<br>  <br>  if you want to celebrate your upcoming wedding then why are you having a wedding reception...it just seems dumb to me, but i respect other ppls opinions...I guess its only an american tradition..seems more like a way to spend more moeny and with this economy...hmm i dont think its a smart idea...unless you can claim it in your tax return|`|CkN4pgpCaa	Everyone gets together for the rehearsal (which I think is necessary).  It's just a nice way of showing the people in the bridal party and parents and grandparents that you appreciate their contributions to your big day.  It also helps add to the excitement of the big day.  It can help bridesmaids and groomsmen mingle a bit and be more comfortable around each other at the wedding.  Also, sometimes people other than the MOH and Best Man make toasts at the rehearsal dinner.<br>  <br>  I suppose it's not totally necessary, but I think it's a nice way to show your appreciation.|`|qRIMM2ycaa	It's exactly what the name implies.<br>  A rehearsal.<br>  <br>  In most modern cases they're not really needed anymore, but just kept for tradition.<br>  A traditional American/European wedding is a very complicated and formal affair, and most modern wedding are vary simplified compared to what you would have found 100 years ago, where a rehearsal would have been very much needed.|`|239548019a89f1b3358d72761eef3170aa	Just to show the people in the wedding you appreciate them taking time out of their schedule to come to the rehersal. You can always have it a a "non food time so they won't have any exxpectiations you will feed them or you can have it at a house and do a home cooked meal.|`|9i0zG1iTaa	The rehearsal dinner is typically after the rehearsal for the ceremony. Its just a nice way to thank your family, friends, and everyone involved in your wedding.|`|wADnvKGFaa	Its to thank your family and friends who had to drag themselves out on a Friday night to fake walking down the aisle!

It is also a way to make sure everyone knows what they need to do for the wedding.<br>  <br>  Usually everyone meets at the church first and they do a run through of how the bridal party will come down the aisle and what everyone can expect - depending on how big the bridal party is, this can take minutes to a good hour or more.  Then everyone meets at a restaurant usually right afterward.<br>  <br>  When I got married a few years ago, the rehearsal dinner is where my now husband and I passed out gifts to our family members and bridal party for being so willing to help with the big day; to show our appreciation.  And my husband and I exchanged gifts to each other there as well.  It was nice.<br>  <br>  Definitely a good time had by all!|`|sGP6s7uraa	Rehearsal dinners are traditional but they are actually quite useful.  It's all the attendents and closest family members there (usually the ones walking down the aisle) and a basic "run-through" of what they are supposed to do during the ceremony.  Some people make this part of the rehearsal dinner more than what it is (have you seen Bridezilla?).  Afterwards, everyone has dinner together.  Attendant's gifts are passed out by the bride and groom and usually the parent's gifts too.  A few toasts, nice conversation and maybe a few stories of the bride and groom. It's just a pre-gathering before the gathering if you will as well as "dress rehearsal" for the next day without the "dress."|`|b2Cr9E5Gaa	You do your wedding rehearsal and then you do a dinner with the close family and your wedding party, this is when you give your attendants their gifts and its usually when the mans family welcomes the womans family, toasts are given, and its an opportunity to get to know one another and mingle before the wedding, it also is a way of officially announcing that the celebration is on.<br>  I think the rehearsal is a great idea, we plan on BBQ (august wedding) and having some wine or champagne for toast, its a nice way to relax and it doenst have to be expensive|`|5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	These aren't held where I'm from, either (western Canada). Usually the rehearsal is around 7 p.m., so it would be more common to gather at someone's home after for drinks, munchies, and chitchat. One of my sisters hosted us at her home, and those attending were just the wedding party, siblings, parents.|`|iKYNUni0aa	its just to go over things before the wedding hand out attendent gifts welcome out of town guests and show appreciation to the bridal party
XUPsK2Nsaa	Most times the person is in a casket. Open or closed to the familys discretion. The family is lined up sitting or standing most times waiting for the condolences. Its natural to be nervous and the first few times you see her you will cry, or want to excuse urself for a minute. I hate to say thin, then you kind of get used to seeing that person in that way by the end of the night. People will be morning and crying and well, funerals an wakes are terrible. The point is as much as you loved her, at the wake its not about you unless you were reallyyyy close. Its about sucking it up and being there for her loved ones.  I'm sooo sorry 4 ur loss. It will never be the same, but your time for morning wil get better|`|niq3ETl0aa	First of all, I am so sorry for you. Don't be afraid. One thing that surprised me was our loved ones don't look the same in the coffin. They almost don't look like themselves. And if you touch them they are as hard as rock. You are saying goodbye to the shell they used to live in. Their spirit is not in that shell anymore. Don't worry.

Guys at that age will say anything to manipulate girls into having sex with them. <br>  <br>  Ok so he said he was heartbroken, saddened and you were his life... blah blah blah if that were so after having sex with you, he would have fought to keep you. I think you should stick with Zach and realize that you don't "need" anyone to get your life in order. Fix your grades, go back to cheer leading and forget about the jerk, he used you plain and simple.|`|fRQHpKCPaa	Your not a terrible person, its just a matter of cirucmstance.

Be Strong and Good Luck.
1239271c3de85dde812326b9aaafb7d8aa	you have good reason.  It seems to me that he his hiding something.  If he is "happily married" why would he feel the need to open a personal myspace and then try and then weakly justify its existence when confronted.  I would suggest getting some marriage counseling.|`|FBhjhjR0aa	dwelling won't get you anywhere but unhappy and alone.|`|naequcqlaa	My feelings are that now it's just become nothing but an "issue".  You believed him, he swore to you, you KNOW his morals & high standards in/of life, but I just think it's gone just a bit too far.  Now like I said, it's become an issue between the two of you.  On his side of things, you did believe him when he told you he WAS telling you the truth.  His whole thing on being absolutely clear on the "condom" end of things & not even trusting them.  I really do feel he's being honest w/you.  As I first read on, his standards of love & life to me are very high & seem to me to be trustworthy.  You've now got a "thing" for not believing him for some reason & I don't quite understand why.  I truly do NOT believe he is NOT hiding anything.  Nothing sexually anyway.  Yes, he did do wrong, BUT he did admit to it.  These stupid double standard computer flings are just that I believe.  You can't for a minute trust anything anyone says, don't even know if the pictures are even of themselves or not.  I did it one time, just emailed back & forth a couple times, then asked IF that was an "updated" picture of him.  Well, come to find out it sure wasn't!  The updated one wasn't even recognizable vs the one he had to "intice" the females.  It was so unbelieveable.  That ended that, not because of what he looked like, but the fact I felt he wasn't being truthful from the very beginning, so was a complete turn off to me.  That ended that for anymore of those kind of sites & coresponding even.  IF you can't even start out on the honest truth, then why bother at all.  Just from all you stated from the very beginning, I do NOT believe he would be "cheating material".  I don't feel he would want to even "dirty" himself let alone chance doing anything to hurt his wife & family that I believe he loves.  He doesn't even sound like that type of person.  I just feel the lie dector test bit just put him over the line so to speak.  And I may be wrong, but I think it's boiled down to just the principal of things now & nothing else.  It almost sounds like a TV drama to be honest w/you.  Do you honestly think your hormones have taken over at this stage of the game & that's where you're coming from at this point?  It's just ashame you now feel you'll never trust him & all because of the lie dector test.  Really, how important is it?!  Is it honestly worth chancing loosing a good marriage, a good husband & father, & all because of this "test"!  Now you're saying that not even the test w/be good enuf!  I feel that's a real shame to let all this hurt your marriage to the point of where it's become.  Isn't all you've gone thru in your whole life worth just letting this whole thing go at this point in time?  Yo're willing to just throw it all away just for this one stupid I just hope you'll re think everything & try to put things in better prospective & think about all you'd be loosing & ruining because of this one thing.  Can't you just let it go for everyone's sake?  Have a good talk & put the past in the past & start a whole new beginning,  Build it on trust & love like you had in the very beginning,  To me, it sure wouldn't be worth throwing all you've had up until now completely away.  What ashame.  Deep down you know the "real" him & all he stands for.  You know down deep inside who he honestly is.  He did a dumb thing, knows it, admitted it, & I'd just be willing to let it go & start anew.  It's sure worth it.  IF you find you're rite, he's wrong, then go from there.  But I just cannot see loosing all you've invested in this far in your lives together.  I believe things do happen for a reason & I believe he's sure learned a good lesson from all this.  Can't you at least go forward, forgive & put this in your past.  You've got too much to loose, but so much to gain from it.  I trust you w/rethink things & do what's best for ALL of you.  It takes a far bigger person to go forward than someone who wants to throw everything away & loose it all.  I DO wish you ALL the best..do what's rite for ALL of you...:)|`|IfOTZhQyaa	His mistake was not being able to tell you how he was feeling, he admits that. You made the mistake of bringing the matter all over again when you said you forgave him. If you are worried about trust what those it say about you when you say something and then not mean it. I think your husband is being honest and sincere with you and if you continue with this issue you will push him away. Lie detector test are not admissible in courts because they are not foolproof. You will not be satisfied even if he takes one because you are hurt and that's understandable. That should have been said before you forgave him not after. When you forgive someone you can not bring the issue up ever again because your word will have no validation anymore and you set yourself up for disappointment after disappointment. You need to let this go and make sure not to become complacent. Don't give him an excuse to do that again. He needs to communicate before not after the fact.|`|YYAmBsvXaa	i would've freaked out as well. but you forgave him... time to let it be. if he did something- trust me when he would look at you he would regret every minute of what he did. i don;t think he did anything.

It is kind of like you said you believed them and that you want to move forwards, but yet you don't believe or trust them and you don't or can't move forwards because you are constantly bringing it up.<br>  <br>  I am sure that your hormones are playing a big part on this situation - and it is good that you know that.  But you have to let go of the situation.<br>  <br>  It sounds like your husband really could of just had the My Space as an attention thing as about 70% of men feel rejected and left out while their partners are pregnant.

Bad move. He still values you from what I can gather and he'll not risk anything to break your trust any further (unless he's the bad type). My suggestion is to leave it where it is. Appreciate the attention he is giving you now. If you continue to show him mistrust he will feel you now value him less and the feeling could grow and be reciprocal. Then you end up losing each other. Tell him whatever he did or how far he went, he should never do that again because you love him and are disturbed by the thought of him cheating (Say only if you mean it). Too much suspicion and accusation kills enthusiasm.
k6mYgCBXaa	Fact is we all MAKE time for those things in our lives that our MOST important to us. Apparently you haven't reached a high level of priority in her life YET! But when you see her again make sure it is a great time , be fun and lighthearted and then she WILL look forward to spending more time with you and that gives you a great opportunity to become someone in her life who does get a slice of her valuable free time : )<br>  <br>  And no, I don't think she is getting together just to break things off with you or tell you she isn't interested.

Go for someone nice and that you've known for awhile. or just go to someone completely new. you just have to try!|`|OPLbaYgXaa	go onto why not date me.com all you have to do is post a video of yourself and everyone will want to date u.I mean if u are sweet and kind and cute|`|CHORH9Ywaa	call 406-381-9133 and she will give you any thing you want.|`|kf5oUKpBaa	you HAVE to keep trying and be a bit more pesonable!!  stop sayin why and say why not!!|`|TD1Sddw2aa	what is your approach?|`|P2vz7X8laa	You can go in a pub, where a lot of single people are there, and then you see a group of girls and like go and ask them a question like "Do u have time plz?" and contineue the conversation. Then ask them if they r single... Good Luck!!|`|Y8UCdHxhaa	Three places - eHarmony, eHarmony, eHarmony...and I don't work for them...|`|oRJOihzwaa	You've been asking the wrong girls|`|wt4EYPCLaa	are u like a social outcast??|`|OuPtLtfmaa	go to the mall and shop for eye candy (wow i've told like 5 people that o.O)|`|AA11991028	go out more like the mall where lots of women love to shop.|`|6krRvf9qaa	perhaps ,you have not yet met the girl most suitable for you<br>  perhaps,you are not yet ready for a relation<br>  or,it is not the right time for it <br>  may be you deserve better than those you see<br>  but if you mean meeting the one love of your life,then we only wait and you will see<br>  generally the most patient people get the best|`|C62F31Dwaa	All I can say is...Too bad for you, bud.

KBkTDOZUaa	If he has a girlfriend then I'm afraid he's off-limits. Say you went up to him, told him how you feel? Say he said he had feelings for you too. Where's that gonna get you. If he splits with his girlfriend who he must have fancied at some point - enough to go out with her, then how do you know he won't do the same to you? Either that or he didn't like her that much but went out with her anyway. Still could happen to you. Either that or he won't split up with her. Either way its a shady area. You don't even know him properly, his girlfriend probably does. You don't even know if you 'like' him. His girlfriend almost certainly does. Is it worth destroying someones relationship over your maybe-feelings for a guy you don't even know? Think it over. In the end its your choice. I get that he's leaving soon so its important to make the right decision though. Maybe try and get to know him as a friend? That's a no-fail solution. You can figure out if you really like him, and you'll know him still when he goes to college if you become good friends. You'll also probably end up discovering if his relationship with his current girlfriend is serious or if you have a chance. Good luck. Please think your decision through though.|`|239548019a89f1b3358d72761eef3170aa	Avoid him like the plague and hang out with people your age, you know not to be around him because you started out saying he is too old. So just do not go there!|`|eZj1qCd7aa	find another GIRL|`|ck2GSl2Saa	Move on, im pretty sure he see's you as easy sex.|`|gkqmrIAGaa	If he is a senior and on his way to college than he is either very near the age of 18 or has turned 18. An 18 year old male is legally an adult. It would be against the law for him to become involved with a freshman in highschool. Try to think of that and his safety. It is extremely important that you look for a boy your own age or at most a year older. I have a neighbor whose nephew was 18 and involved and had sex with a 16 year old he girls parents didn't like it and reported him to the police. The poor young man was sentenced and is spending 5 years in prison for statutory rape. Statutory rape can be consensual, the girl may agree to it but by law she is not considered old enough to have sex that is consensual. So by law the 18 year old committed a very serious crime. I think five years is disgusting a little bit of time a few months in jail would suffice I believe. But it is the law.|`|bXGwTQy6aa	he Just wants fresh meat...and im sure he's done it before so while this is excited for you,to him its routine and its nothing new...try dating someone with more in common,like younger...at least until you become more experienced
3NoQuoWuaa	Whoa. Slow down. You both are moving much too fast. To answer your question, yes it is possible to fall in love but hormones calling each other can also appear to be love, which this probably is. Love takes a long time to build. It is based on respect, communication and commitment. Love is acceptance and the ability to forgive. Only time will tell if it is truly love. In the meantime your upside down world will eventually straighten out and then you will know for sure.r|`|T3b4I4kXaa	You can fall in love... at least temporarily. You are dealing with a lot of hormonal upheaval. <br>  <br>  You need to back off sex at your age... you are not capable of handling the fallout on any level. If you insist, at least have the good sense to get some counseling and birth control from Planned Parenthood.|`|RI1brp91aa	yes, it's possible to fall in love. Love comes to those un-expecting it.
DW2wGx0vaa	college is very broad so there will be plenty of opportunities to introduce yourself to the people there. also join clubs such as sorority's or fraternity's then you will have sisters or brothers for life.. attend all the activities going on. join a sports, clubs. trust me college will be worth it .. good luck on you journey|`|2KC467tFaa	It always helps me to do small, considerate things for people. I'll hold the door open for someone, smile at people, compliment them if I like something about their style or hair, or strike up a random conversation with a stranger. It's amazing how much you can learn about others in a short amount of time. The reason I do this is to have a better understanding of people and to boost my self-esteem by knowing I did something nice for someone. It will also help you to be a bit more outgoing. You should practice now. It's your last year. You won't see these people again. You have nothing to lose. Set small goals for yourself. If you don't know how to drive a standard, learn. It'll make you feel like you can accomplish anything. Truth is, you can accomplish anything. You just need to prove it to yourself. Good luck and have fun enjoying life.|`|Py3XJc8saa	I was pretty much the same way. Since I've been at college I've made a lot of new friends, but I've still kept the old ones from high school. college is a pretty great experience, there are a lot more people there so you can find people with the same interests as you. just stay positive :)|`|ZQmo5Th7aa	Look, your not even going to know any HS people or friends 10 years from now. Don't worry about it too much! Your senior! be happy your leaving HS and moving on to bigger and better places/people.<br>  Im Freshman and I only have like 1-2 friends I hangout with, I just wanna get through HS.|`|aclhGwh3aa	join some after schools programs or clubs or groups and meet and talk to people.
06f1b8496562ceae60b7c13272bc0615aa	If you are having fun and it isnt hurting anyone else then it is all well and good. Dont ever let anyone pressure you into being someone you arent. No matter what age we are, we all do things that could be considered childish by others.|`|9b3537c30933da7786dc8b95599adf7daa	no|`|6C5NDSBSaa	Heeeeeell no that doesn't make you childish!

ZRityMV8aa	take your balls out of your throat and talk to the girl!  how many more hints does she have to give you?|`|YYdtd47baa	Why not talk to her? She shares a common interest, (acting) and she is interested in you too...you should go for it. Obviously she wants you to make the first real move. Just seriously talk to her, and if you really don't like her all that much, just treat her like a friend. You don't want to crush her. Good luck blingers.<br>  Izy|`|wBcbKf5Jaa	Talk to her! She seems like she wants to talk to you, and if she is a girl you would like to talk to, then talk to her.  What harm could come from simply talking to her?  Best case scenario you get a date, worst case you don't, no biggy.|`|26669f79ff268e870aed960f8814ae6eaa	Sounds like you just need to get over it and talk to her if you like her. At this point, I would just recommend to stay quiet until you get it right in your head.|`|ptPvDdU8aa	tell her to leave u alone and if she dont then tell the teacher that she wont quit looking at you cuz that is called stalking lol well tell her to stop and to focus on her acting not on u kk|`|DlrHF9L5aa	Just be nice to her and see if she is into you, maybe she just wants to be friends|`|6zCalKvKaa	Slip her 20 bucks and ask her to go home with you|`|QnB84dZQaa	You're not.

Talking to her is no harm.  Acting could take many years and no one knows where that will go.  You can always have friends without "slowing them down".  We don't consume our friends....Good luck.|`|SZNHvHohaa	Listen Blingers this girl has it bad for you but...she is scaring you! So, go for her OK.

QODJNf1oaa	Life without love is meaningless. I believe that we were put here on earth to fall in love, and be with that one person for the rest of our lives. There are people who say that they live to be successful, or for some other motive, but I feel that somewhere down the road, their lives will become empty and they will feel the need to find their soul mates.|`|8gDRQ7v2aa	No, because if you don't experience true love than you missed a part in life, therefore you can't live life to the fullest|`|06Rlukp7aa	It is very hard, I can tell you that. I think we need to find passions and interests and surround ourselves with people we love and care about.

Without love our life would be empty and worthless.  However there is different kind of love we might experience and each one is very unique and important.  There is the love relationship between mother and child, men and women.  We can live life to the fullest as long we do experience love.|`|hRNpGnktaa	Its a just a life. An existence. With love it gives you a completely new reason to live. You don't just live for yourself, you live for your partner.<br>  Love is a necessity to a prosperous life, where you live happy and die satisfied|`|6sJhoXAAaa	Nuns and priests don't have human love, but they do love God.  Some people never experience physical love, but do love their art or academics, and some people are happy loving nature or their jobs.  In other words everybody loves in his or her own way.|`|tJDUkyWwaa	Yes. I believe they can. I think that love is something people try to believe in to keep them going when the time is rough.

Then, you can go and find hot chocolate afterwards.<br>  <br>  If you'd rather stay indoors, you could go bowling or indoor mini-golfing.  The indoor golf place around here is glow in the dark.  It can sound rather dorky, but they have pretty cool music and it can be fun if you let yourself be a little silly.  <br>  <br>  If you have a little more money, you could go see a sports game (your bf will love you for it! lol).

I am sure she wants what is best for you and she probably wants a kid from you.  maybe she is scared you won't have any now that you have 2 kids in your life already.|`|eeaXYyCNaa	She hates him because she doesn't want you to get hurt. He is very young to have 2 kids and she realizes that.  I am not putting him down I also had 2 at his age.  That is how I know he is young for it.  <br>  <br>  She is just trying to be protective.  She loves you and wants the best for you.  She probably didn't have a man with 2 kids at 21 the idea son in law.  Give her some time.  If he really is as good a man as you say he is...she will come to realize that.  Give it time.|`|gC8xO53Oaa	Are you sure it's only because of children? I don't know how old you are, but if there's a 4 or more year difference, she may think you're too young to get involved with a man with children. You may have a lot more to experience in life before settling with a man with children. She's just afraid for you and maybe thinks he's in to you because he needs someone to care for his kids. Most parents would rather their child start a life with someone equal to them. Not always the right thing, but we just want our children to start out with someone who is just beginning just like child is.|`|58e1b1e10dbc48a33c1c0667b5fac25faa	Does she hate him because he has 2 kids or is something else? It's a big deal getting involved with someone that young who already has so much responsibility. <br>  <br>  Maybe your mom is seeing something that you're not able to see because you're vision is clouded with these feelings of love.

Not sure.  I mean I have my own experience with my friend's hippie parents as a kid and it was one of most stable families that I knew.

7b6177ffccd38a7fe7428a728f8a79c1aa	I would adopt a 3-pronged approach to handle this.  First, once you get done helping her with her problems (and she presumably thanks you afterwards), just say "No sweat.  I *know* you would do the same thing for me, if I ever had problems which could use your advice."  This gently sets up the expectation that she will help when you have concerns as well.<br>  <br>  Second, if she says she doesn't want to hear it because it's too negative, you might ask if there would be a better time for you to discuss them.  She may have just finished with something stressful, and now needs a break.  If she's willing to discuss them later, that is a different alternative.<br>  <br>  Third, if she will only discuss her problems, then you can try discussing yours immediately after you've helped with hers.  If she's not willing to listen then (when she is presumably already in a negative state of mind), then it will set a sharp contrast between the willingness of each of you to help the other.<br>  <br>  Finally, if nothing else works, then when she calls you with her problems, tell her that you are too busy to listen to negative issues (i.e. use her tactic back on her, and see if she likes it as much).  You should save this for last, as it is pretty harsh... but it is also the truth.  After all, you *are* too busy to be anyone's emotional tampon, particularly if they are never willing to reciprocate for you.|`|Lkik9Sr7aa	point it out to her that u help her with her probs but she doesnt help u with urs or just say its to negative and u dont wanna hear it.
CljCJrT1aa	Well from what you said maybe he's having a hard time in his life, like a recent breakup with a girlfriend and doesn't want to hang out with females right now. Maybe it's just simply he doesn't want to hang out with you anymore. Maybe he's been spending too much time with you and your friends and is starting to like one of them and is confused. Hope this helped|`|a6f8IoISaa	You should give him his space|`|LJwhaNIDaa	It's likely that all three answers he gave are true to some degree and may reflect a specific reaction to each particular questioner, at the time the question was asked.  <br>  <br>  I think  the best overall reason is likely peer pressure. <br>  <br>  It's not considered cool for a guy, particularly an adolescent, to pal around with three girls as his main group of friends.  The teacher may have clued him into some behind the scenes teasing.|`|yqHu4DGraa	Just give him space. This has happened to me before. I think he just needs some space. My best guy friend told me he wasn't allowed to hang out with me because his soccer coach said I was "too distracting" for him, and he had to "focus on soccer, soccer, soccer."<br>  It also ended up that he had a crush on me. <br>  So maybe your guy friend has a crush on one of you girls. He may just feel awkward around you guys.|`|U6oUR0RQaa	it does sound like peer preasure, over somat????? <br>  however it could be number 3 99% sure its also linked.|`|GexgmXMJaa	well that dude was a fake i wouldnt worry about it.|`|WtPQaGMXaa	the guy obviously could care less about u or ur friends. wat u should do is eat potatoes. lots and lots of potatoes. Vladimir lenin is worse the john lennon. my mom once told me that babies come from daddies. i didnt believe her, so i went to the alamo and ended up in luray caverns. i was so confused that i fell off a wafflecake.<br>  <br>  wat im trying to say is, just ignore it and it will go away|`|58oTO8qFaa	I found this out the hard way.  Chase something and it'll keep running.  Ignore it and it'll become curious and come around.|`|SSfXwkpnaa	seems like he doesnt want to tell the truth - maybe he's embarrissed or doesn't want to hurt anyone.  give him space if he wants to be friends he will|`|uSep1sTXaa	you didn't explain much in that ^^ paragraph. maybe your friends like him? and it sounds like you do too...|`|PiF42aaOaa	how old are you guys?
7cZqP2Lxaa	A card that says: "You know, money is tight, and this Birthday is no exeption, I don't have alot of money for your gift, so heres your Frikinn Birthday card.."<br>  <br>  Lol|`|eYmIlVnGaa	get him a DVD, there are a lot of option for $10 and its a good gift that you can make personal by picking something you know he will like!
6af21274c064054ad2c6f16d176571faaa	One, he's embarassed.  Two, he's afraid of what you'll think of him if he starts getting aroused while watching it with you.  He's afraid that you will think that he likes the girl in the video more than you.  He probably just doesn't want you thinking that he thinks about those women when he wanks more than he thinks about you.  The reality of the situation is probably when he wanks to porn, he looks for someone or some situation that reminds him the most of you.<br>  Either way, at least he didn't go out and cheat on you.|`|yhEDUN6qaa	He's probably embarassed. My husband got really wierd when I tried to look at his porn while he was sitting right next to me.|`|ADP9swbMaa	He's probably embarrassed or something. Some people prefer to watch their porn alone.|`|ApoPp1Lhaa	maybe he's gotten so used to watching porn by himself that having u there would be weird. just tell him it gets u wet or something|`|ZRityMV8aa	he's probably embarrassed.|`|mDDUsNG9aa	your man is not right....I love watching porn with my women watching her get all hot and juicy|`|4HoVVCenaa	It can be embarrassing to the guy. I know I'm embarrassed to watch it in with my girl. I do it anyway, but it is embarrassing.|`|bO2rzfISaa	He doesn't want to cheat on his porn with you.<br>  <br>  EDIT: It stuns me that women have let their men convince them that porn is "natural" yet it's obviously dirty and furtive. If my husband did this I'd divorce him.|`|JI7NQ9TNaa	Porn and erotica is a "guilty pleasure" for a lot of men.<br>  <br>  It's not cheating in my opinion, but it is fantasy fodder.<br>  Don't be upset. Yes, it is a turn on for men...but its not something they can share for most.<br>  <br>  Let him enjoy the eye candy...and make sure he knows you don't have a problem with it!|`|T7qgrOJzaa	Sometimes, sometimes not. My boyfriend only likes to watch it for his "personal time" and doesn't seem to enjoy it if we watch it together. It's not a big deal really. Just let it go.|`|aSSXt6tlaa	he's just flogging the dolphin and he's bummed that you found out.|`|UfRMJheeaa	He's a pervert.
LJwhaNIDaa	Yes.<br>  <br>  The important factor is that both people view each other as friends and not as a possible romantic interest. <br>  <br>  If one of the friends secretly wants a romantic relationship, and is hoping the friendship will morph into a love relationship...Then that will cause tension and eventually ruin the friendship.|`|9ionkBvuaa	yeah because not every boy/girl has feelings for evey boy/girl there friends with.|`|CPZA5qrGaa	Yes. Provided you are mature about it.<br>  Women are aptly ready to express themselves as to be more out going<br>  as for being compassionate with kissing us guys than we are of kissing them.<br>  We tend to think it more of something when there isn't anything to it.<br>  That's where we make our mistake. It's only a friendly kiss.<br>  Could you deal with her giving you a friendly kiss and leave it at that?<br>  Or do you tend to think she's into you? If that's the case...You blew it.<br>  If you get jealous over a woman that you aren't going with...I'd say you<br>  aren't ready for that kind of friend yet. How ever, you can be friends<br>  none the less.|`|gC8xO53Oaa	Yes they can. I've had many guy friends and I cherish them all. Some of our best friendships can be evolved because we know there won't be the confusion of other emotions that could interfere. I'd hope we could all be mature enough to recognize the difference and enjoy our friendships with everyone.|`|m8QfHC7uaa	Of course.  Why not...unless one of you has the hots for the other, and one of you is married or both, then include partners. <br>  Why...you learn a lot from the different sex. But must be kept only on a friend level.|`|ADP9swbMaa	Of course they can. Anyone who thinks otherwise is close minded and probably insecure.|`|osZ5zVEDaa	Yes they can. I am Married and only think of my wife in that way so I can be friends just fine with women. Also even before that I was friends with plenty of women who were nice, but not my type so I also had not problems being friends or getting the relationship confused in my head.|`|8gnp5Kkjaa	I think it is easier for a man and a woman to be friends if both of them are single.  Because when you start bringing their respective partners' emotions and opinions into it, that can strain the friendship.|`|XdUL0PXmaa	I reckon it depends on the person, but in general yes; although there has to be an attraction there in the first place for you to become friends with anyone, male or female, it's just whether that attraction is enough to grow into anything else.|`|HpwevWYlaa	Yeah, I usually get along better with guys. For me, my guy friends are much more supportive than my female friends. They may not understand everything I tell them, and they can take the teasing a little too far but they're like brothers to me.|`|WBT8vtLraa	yesss they deff can! i have plenty of male friends who i consider my brothers and only my brothers i see them no other way even though they are good looking men. who ever is against it is jealous, insecure and very controlling.|`|1g4R3SN0aa	ya totally they definitely can and if people don't think so that is weird!
tzPEckiZaa	She should break up with you for invading her privacy. You have no right to snoop in her computer and read her emails. You're a creep and deserve to have her dump you.|`|47af2fda89839c0ec02e273cff59d82daa	dude, shes gonna break up with you the second she finds out you were snooping through her account anyway.  it shows you dont trust her.  <br>  <br>  and if she just joined, maybe she hasnt figured out how to change any of the status stuff yet?|`|GvamTVqAaa	just ask her.  If you can't communicate about things now then you might as well save yourself a divorce..|`|cdL4wzGbaa	If everything else is filled out on her profile but the relationship status part,I would be suspicious.Sometimes it is good to invade privacy.|`|sGP6s7uraa	You wonder WHY she hasn't told you? Because you're invading her privacy and probably knew that you would get really jealous (like the way you're sounding now).  Just leave her alone and leave this alone.|`|HJ0YTWjVaa	You can obviously tell that most of the answers are from females about breaking up with you for evading her privacy. Yes you should trust your fiance and not evade her privacy, but if you stumbled onto the web page I completely understand why you read it. As for the comment that some guy left about not allowing his girl to chat with guys.... DONT say that to her no matter you do. Telling a girl that you don't allow them to do something will only cause a huge fight. Tell her that it bothers you that she didn't put anything for the relationship status. She has guy friends from High School, work, and/or College that she may be talking to and that does not mean she is cheating. You have to trust that she is not. If you can't trust that then you don't need to be together!|`|b2Cr9E5Gaa	This is horrible, I would be so hurt to know my fiance snooped through my stuff because he was jealous, I would much rather he come to me and ask me what my year book was and if i connected with anyone from high school, you should have been honest with her, how many other times have you "checked" up on her? You really should be ashamed of yourself seriously.<br>  You are way over reacting, maybe shes talking to high school friends from years ago, many of us girls have lots of guy friends as I am sure you had good female friends in school as well. <br>  You should definitely say something about this, tell her the truth that you snooped|`|qKbwBYRTaa	I don't understand all these people saying "you're invading her privacy, how dare you". My boyfriend and I share everything, emails, passwords, text messages, everything. Why hide things? You are in a relationship!<br>  <br>  You need to ask her about it. If she did not tell me that she was talking to all those people, I would be suspicious. Confront her, don't let it go. You are always going to wonder or "snoop into her privacy" as some people call it. She should not be hiding stuff like that.|`|zfgOrR8saa	just tell her to add relationship status, this should be very simple for her to do.. if she starts saying like "oh it doesnt matter" or "why?" something like that.. there might be a problem<br>  <br>  its better to find out like that, than telling her you have been geeking her convos with guys.. If it was my GF though i wouldnt allow her to chat like that with guys|`|L0Gwa10paa	you are in a relationship which means trust should be first and foremost. if you are feeling insecure maybe you should just ask.|`|v7ZmPEwOaa	maybe its nothing and you are just reading too much into it.
N39uQiZMaa	Maybe he's just joking when he said that he goes out with other girls, or maybe that's not the true answer he said, maybe your friend (if she's a girl) has a crush on him and she's just jealous and made that up, or maybe (if he's a boy) he's got a crush on you and made that up. Why would he flirt with you so badly if he doesn't like to be with you. Well, some boys are really like that. They flirt with a girl, but behind the curtains they just want to hurt her feelings (maybe). For me, the best thing to do is ask him personally and seriously in a place out of reach of ears. In here, he will be able to tell the truth. If he loves you, let him explain why he said that he goes out with other girls. But if he said no, sorry. But if you feel that he'll be really saying no, abort this operation. The best thing for revenge is to feel nothing for him and make him jealous. Flirt with his friends, they like you right? Make him feel the envy that he should feel. But again, think about it first. Maybe he's the type that makes decisions by thinking of it deeply.<br>  <br>  Consider the these: he likes you, he has friends that likes you, and the your friend ask him what do he thinks of you. Maybe this is what circulated in his mind. If he said yes, there can be a possibility that he and his friends will fight and break up, and maybe he's not sure if you like him. Bottom line, if he says 'yes' 75% fight with friend and only 50% of he and you being together. Gets? He said no to avoid friendship conflicts, if I'm correct. Well, think about it owkei..,  Relax and enjoy life. As if he's the only guy in this world. I'm a guy, you can like me.. lol.... c",)|`|VUWlu578aa	ok first off you werent dating him so that dont matter and second it sounds like he leadd you on trust me im in seventh too and im good at relationships also im physic and another secret but i cant say that anyway this should help|`|yjEBCqSCaa	Sweetie for get him your way to young to worry about boys this young in your life pay attention in class go to college and all the guys will want you!|`|u9GQRbhvaa	He's a lame 8th grader that's just horny and developing.

Your wedding vows and contract are you swearing to an agreement. If she does not take your word now, why bother getting married?<br>  <br>  Trust is a central part of most relationships. If there is no trust, do not bother with promises. "I love you" is a phase that depends a lot on your relationship and the trust you have for eachother. I love my cat, but I do not promise to not touch other cats.<br>  <br>  Maybe you two need to get some couples counseling and work on the trust issues.<br>  <br>  good luck,<br>  <br>  Zule, the old guy|`|6xXAMwxBaa	you can't, <br>  <br>  she's guilty.<br>  <br>  William Shatner for President 2012

cCymTwdcaa	Ignore Sholly and the B|tch Squad. From their questions and answers, we all know who the real bridezillas are. It shouldn't be so fun to report people like that. What you did was mildly underhanded, but you should in no way feel guilty. I have seen your past questions, and know that your FSIL has gone out of her way to make your life miserable, and to ruin your wedding. That was The Dress, and she knew that, which is the only reason why she wanted it. What's the chances that out of millions of dresses, that was the only dress she could find? Nil. Don't worry about it, by worrying, you're only letting her win.|`|Q9ZHnGBMaa	OMG... I can not understand 1/2 of your story.

Good Luck!!|`|vXYQcixvaa	Im assuming if you have been together for 20 years that you are married. But even f you are not....that is an awful lot of time invested! Do not throw it away! Ofcourse he hasnt changed! They never do! LOL But hear me out....<br>  <br>  You 2 obviously had a spark at some point to stay together this long! As long as its a good healthy relationship (no verbal or physical abuse) i would suggest to first look back at when you first met....maybe a first date? Try and re create that! See if you old feeling come back!  <br>  Secondly....communication communication communication! The key to a good sex life is talking about it! "ooh..ya i like this ....do that to me...." etc etc....or "i dont like that...maybe do this..." those are things you could say to each other either before or during sex. I really feel its easier to say what you want when you are in the act....less awkward then sitting at Denny's and talkn abt sex for example. LOL<br>  <br>  Good luck! And dont be afraid to give a little....and ask for some of what you like too!|`|d36OrpbDaa	therapy.  and honest communication.<br>  <br>  have you told him that you are feeling unsatisfied?  like more than "i'm frustrated," nagging, anything like that.<br>  <br>  have you said, "i feel like we aren't connecting anymore and i need that to stay in a relationship with someone.  sex and conversation have become difficult.  what do you think?"<br>  <br>  be direct.  be kind, but completely honest.  try to sandwich the bad stuff in between good stuff.<br>  <br>  for instance:<br>  <br>  "i love that after 20 years we're still having sex.  but i'm worried because i'm not feeling satisfied.  i want to connect with you and be intimate."<br>  <br>  the bad thing is "sandwiched" between two good things!  that way, it's a lot easier to say it, and it's easier on his ego.<br>  <br>  consider marriage counseling.  if the first counselor doesn't work or one of you doesn't feel comfortable with that person, then TRY ANOTHER COUNSELOR - don't just give up!!  sometimes it takes a few tries before you find the right counselor to help you two work through your issues.<br>  <br>  i would be really hesitant to throw away a 20 year relationship.  especially for something so nebulous and "fairy tale"-ish as "that special someone is out there somewhere."<br>  <br>  i'm of the opinion that there is no such thing as one 'special someone.' he could be right under your nose, but if you don't work at it, it'll never work out and you'll lose him.<br>  <br>  relationships take work.  a LOT of it.  but if both people contribute and attempt to compromise somewhat, it can be incredibly worth it.<br>  <br>  note, this does not mean he'll meet you halfway - that may be too much to ask of him, if he tends to be stubborn or closed off emotionally... which it sounds like he is.  therefore, any evidence of change or that he's trying to improve things is VERY good and worth praising, often!<br>  <br>  i think sex and emotion go hand in hand, in long term, committed relationships at least.  if you aren't having enough sex, you'll feel less close to your partner.  if you have a lot of feelings talk but no sex, you'll feel frustrated and resentful.  you really need both.<br>  <br>  so try some new sex stuff!  maybe it's too much, or maybe it's not, so i'll list some options:  watch porn (together or alone; you'll learn something! it might turn you on), go to a sex shop, browse magazines for men AND women for sex tips.<br>  <br>  flirt with each other again.  try a different lube.  change your habits - like close the door when you pee, if you leave it open.  ANYTHING to make it different... because different = interesting. interesting = spices things up.<br>  <br>  just know you aren't the only one having this problem.  try some group support systems, maybe even short-term individual counseling to figure out some direction for yourself.  it helps!|`|Y6YaMR34aa	not worth him. leave him.|`|2eztcCO0aa	That special someone isn't out there somewhere.  Instead, there are a lot of someones who might be special to you if you know who you are, what you want and who you're looking for.<br>  <br>  What you have to decide is whether you want to stay with your guy and leave him and be alone.  If the choice was between these two things, would you want to stay with him? <br>  <br>  If so, then work on your relationship.  Start be being honest with him about your sex life.  (You do know, I hope, that a great many women can't have an orgasm from intercourse.  Ask him to help you have an orgasm during foreplay)<br>  <br>  If you'd rather be alone, then break up with your guy.  Once you're on your own, you can work on yourself if you need to, then start looking.  When you're ready to find someone, you'll find him.<br>  <br>  You don't have to worry about missing your chance to meet that special someone while you're with your guy.

T0pkW783aa	Just write what is on your mind.  Let the children know that these are issues which are important to you and will be to them as well.  Write about your own moral values and how much they mean to you and how other people will relate to them when they live a certain way; how they need to respect their body and their health; how their choices can effect different things in their lives; their partners, their relationships, their friends, their jobs.  This is really a wonderful thing to do and will help you and your children to be open to discussion as they grow older.   It would be great if every parent were that concerned and that involved in these types of matters.  Good for you.  Your children are very lucky.
xvey8ixPaa	Hi! I understand and feel for you %110. Your very best thing to do is to let your lawyer know that he was taping you and that you thought that that was not legal. See what they have to say about it. The thing is that no judge is going to sit and watch a video like that and judge the hand off. Do your best. Act like a lady. If they are taping you smile and wave nicely as if your own parent were taping you. Have your daughter look at the camera and say "Hi Grandma!" Smile and be nice. Do have someone with you at the drop off. Play by the rules and do your best. Keep a documentation journal and write everything down.  Rules or no rules about recording devices....I think what is best here is focusing on what you are both doing for your daughter and make sure what she sees is positive. I went through 10 years of this crap....I survived. You will too. So will your daughter. Bring with you afriend or family member and be sweet as honey. Once the custody stuff is over he will calm down. and most likely ignore both of you. Good luck and make sure you talk to your lawyer about it and do what they tell you to!|`|7d535ccd0098dd19bfe900035ca87c98aa	Its immature and ridiculous, thats what it is!!!<br>  <br>  GROW UP.........your children are seeing these actions, and will be  affected by it.<br>  <br>  Communicate like adults.<br>  update:<br>  If he was that dangerous, he wouldnt be allowed visits or he would have to have supervised visits.<br>  Speak to you lawyer again, shes the one who knows the law.|`|q3FDAQ9Baa	I thought that videoing is just fine as long as it's not used in a public way without permission?

It will stop alot of hassles in which you tend to be experienceing.|`|E7RhMRKhaa	If things between you two are so bad that you have to stoop to these measures then both of you should be ASHAMED.

ZjM0ghSnaa	Wait a minute, the girl wants to go out with you, but you say you want to get out of the relationship? does that mean your already going out with her? <br>  <br>  If your not going out with her already, I would go out with her once, just to see if you want to be in a relationship with her. You might not now, but maybe you'll change your mind. Ask her out somewhere fun, or take her to the movies. Sure, almost everyone goes to the movies, but it'll be your first date with her. Or, take her out to a restaurant. <br>  <br>  If you are going out already, just ask yourself if this is the girl who you want to be with. If not, break up with her.|`|Yg2iIneKaa	Don't get yourself into a world of trouble.  mdoggs83 thinks if you doubt your feelings. Break up now. Run don't walk away.

imMsVkKhaa	Homer Simpson never searched for love. Marge just happened to come into his life, and somehow I doubt things would have worked out if they hadn't happened exactly as they did. If possible, it would be very rare for another marriage to be exactly like theirs. These days, there's a lot of pressure towards separation.<br>  <br>  Like you said, though, the most important thing is that they love each other. So if you find someone you feel that strongly about, don't be afraid to let her know and make sure you show it in what you do rather than just what you say. After she trusts you more, you may be able to get away with drinking more and doing really foolish things, but I'd advise against it anyway. :-)
K2QwEM4raa	Just try and get him to talk about his friends,interest or family,or what he likes to do like sports maybe. Ask him not nosy questions just things to get a conversation started. Evey one has to start somewhere.|`|eysDi4rIaa	ask him above what movies / tv shows he has seen and how are the classes are going... that is always a good starting point|`|mpGjPV6Xaa	Both of you just be yourself. I mean it's not that hard to talk to somebody, now if it was about a kiss, then that's a different story. You said " hi " to him, ok now that's a start. From there, ask him how are you today and stuff like that. You know, small talk for now. Once, you 2 mastered the small talk , then make longer conversations. Ask him things like " What do you like to do ? " or " What's your favorite color ? " This just to start you off, you always want to ask things about the person to get know him/her better.<br>  <br>  So, there's nothing to be scared of, just approach him and say hi with some words to back it up while smiling to him. Don't worry, everybody starts off shy, but you will soon get out of it, trust me.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps !!!<br>  <br>  Joseph D : )|`|6eXRX4jpaa	this will sound weird but write down a list of things that you can talk about such as school, family, OBAMA, etc....... before you go on a date. you will remember them more if you do that|`|Y6YaMR34aa	talk about stuff u would talk about with your friends. and if u really like him go on further..|`|EfpnRLyUaa	just star a normal conversation with him and things will go from there|`|bhxIEcr8aa	Ok well this sounds like a typical shy guy so wat you wanna do basically is just make small talk to break da ice.

Hopefully, I would be able to pick up the conversation from there.  There aren't any 'topics' someone can give you that won't be sterotypical or personal.  you have to figure out what to talk about.  after five years, I can only assume you know some of his intersts.  if there is anything similar, talk about them.  I like to talk about things I don't agree on with the other person...it keeps the conversation going.<br>  <br>  Also, I have found that following tangents off topic is better then trying to stay on topic.|`|wTvJq6axaa	Haha, well lets see. You could start off asking how hes been, if he likes dancing or what not. If he says no u could throw a nice little signal at him and say something like "Well i'll help ya out" :) If he does like dancing maybe u could get into somethin like that. U could ask him why he accepted ur invitation, which might allow u to get some feelings out of him. If he answers casually then you could talk about what u guys will be doing at the event. Talk to him about ur classes u have together, maybe about how dumb the teacher is or maybe about some annoying kid lol gets some laughs. yeah i would imagine u all might be to the dance by then lol
874EAxkfaa	a bag of peaches|`|6e58ce6577be3f4549253fc7148b5e1caa	I found the following information on this website: <a href="http://www.georgiauncontesteddivorce.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.georgiauncontesteddivorce.com...</a><br>  <br>  Uncontested Divorces Are Fast and Inexpensive<br>  The cost of divorce in Georgia does not have to be expensive. In an uncontested divorce, for example, the parties have agreed in advance how to divide marital property, allocate debts, arrange for custody of minor children, and set child and spousal support. Our reasonable, flat fees for a no-contest divorce are:<br>  <br>  $425 for uncontested divorce with no minor children <br>  $850 - $1250 for uncontested divorce with minor children (depending on county)<br>  We do not charge for postage, copies, or paralegal fees for your uncontested case. Our flat fees cover the entire cost for your uncontested divorces, except for court costs.<br>  <br>  And this info from <a href="http://www.divorcenet.com/states/georgia/divorce-faq" rel="nofollow">http://www.divorcenet.com/states/georgia...</a><br>  <br>  How much do lawyers cost?<br>  As is the case with any professional, cost varies from law firm to law firm. Lawyers cannot charge a "contingency fee" in a divorce case, so they charge either by the hour or a flat fee. Flat fees are rare, except when the case is truly "uncontested" and all terms have been agreed upon. In a flat fee case, the cost may range from a few hundred dollars to a few thousand dollars, depending on the lawyer and the complexity of the issues (transfers of real estate, retirement funds and the like). For a contested case, most lawyers require a retainer which is an up-front payment which may serve either or both of two purposes: to ensure the lawyer is available and cannot accept employment by the opposing party and to serve as an advance payment for services to be rendered. Most lawyers then bill against that retainer and ask that it be replenished when it runs low or is depleted. Retainers can range from $1,000.00 (or less) to $25,000.00 (or more), depending on the complexity of the case and the law firm's usual practice. Hourly rates charged by lawyers and paralegals vary, but will usually be $100.00 per hour or more for paralegals and from $150.00 to $500.00 per hour for lawyer time.|`|Xr5bU3t1aa	There is no "set price".... everyone's divorce is different.|`|JYgJD0Rwaa	That's right, there is no set price. The only thing that is set is the filing fee. Every state charges is own amount for filing fees, they vary between $150-300.<br>  It depends if your divorce is uncontested or contested. Contested divorces require lawyers (MORE money), while uncontested do not - you can to it yourself, I did.|`|V5JJK8Okaa	LAWYERS:<br>  Fees can range from $100 to $450 per hour, but the average rate would be (i.e. based on intermediate level of experience) $275 per hour.<br>  <br>  ACCOUNTANT:<br>  Fees can range from $125 to $350 per hour depending on the level of expertise required, averaging at $250 per hour|`|E7RhMRKhaa	Call the county courthouse where you live and they will tell you the filing fees.  So much depends on your situation.  Property, kids, etc.

IJIm1Dcsaa	Well as the Mesa police once told me when my now ex was threatening to take our kids out of the country is that until there is either an Order of Protection or a divorce decree stating that he could not then he could do whatever he wanted since he is the biological father. My question is Is there a divorce decree stating what each parent is allowed to do with the kids. I know that in mine for this reason I had it written that he could not take them out of the city without my written consent.<br>  Hope this helps some.|`|AA11180444	Yes, usually when both parents have custody of a child; one parent can take her child where ever she chooses, as you could.   <br>  <br>  Think of it like this.  A couple is happily married, one takes a vacation and one stays home.  Someone has to take the child.  The one staying home can't because he has to work, right?  So it is legal for the other parent to take the child with her.<br>  <br>  Unless there is some court order or document stating otherwise, like a custody agreement.|`|xvey8ixPaa	It all depends on your custody order. If you have no order, there is nothing keeping her from doing so. You need to check your order and find out. It is a good thing to know. And, she might only need to inform you that she is doing that, she might not have to ask you if it is ok. So, do not listen to the bozos in here. Check your order, and if you do not have one, GET A LAWYER and get one!|`|mtOVRAnbaa	If you have no agreement... SHE SURE can... Unless you have something saying she CANT in writing with both signatures.. IT DOESNT MATTER... IF you got him back tho (she couldt do anything about that either ;-) wink wink) good luck doll|`|1239271c3de85dde812326b9aaafb7d8aa	yep.|`|v2a220YWaa	yes, but she cant take him out of the country without your permission|`|NB4h4jTyaa	If she is your current wife, yes. If you are divorced, there should be language addressing this in your divorce decree.|`|6LKEWFPoaa	Yes, that is her son.|`|WA8feS8taa	Yeah she can because he's her child too.
S46FYzmjaa	Be a leader not a follower. Don't let what people say change who you are, besides I'm sure people who love you wouldn't think it was a good idea. Keep your virtue it's one of the best things you have, besides one day the right guy will come along and deserve your pure and wholesome love.|`|Nhi8cxAvaa	NO! Rise above it! People will look at you like a hero if you wait. <br>  <br>  Trust me.|`|2SxIkm7Xaa	Don't give into that crap. They are just jealous, I bet you are pretty and by that you are called names such as ho **** etc. because they don't have the virgin status you have right now. They are jealous because of the guys you get that like you the way they do. Keep staying classy and don't' give in as then you will officially have the title the ho. No one wants that. High school is nothing but a popularity contest that ends when you are about senior and after graduation. <br>  <br>  <br>  Please please please, you do have something to loose when it's not a moment special. The first time should be special, not one you regret later especially if the name calling will increase afterward. I'm sure you don't want that kind of reputation !|`|bu6BhCnpaa	really...are you really asking that?<br>  <br>  first off...your not the only virgin in your school...there is AT LEAST one other virgin...and probably plenty others.<br>  <br>  That said...NO...you should not have sex jsut for sex...if you dont have a monogomus long term bf then its not worth it...trust me.  you COULD jsut do it to do it...but why do it without the strong feelings involved?<br>  <br>  those feelings mkae sex 100 million times better...i promise.  plus our first time...you never forget it...<br>  <br>  AND the earlier you start, the more peopel you are bound to have sex with.  My first was at 15...i wish i had waited...I wish i hadnt had sex with 13 people befor ei met the guy i want to marry...but i cant take that back.<br>  <br>  in addition to that...i never knew what sex could be until i met my now bf...no matter how much i thought i cared about these other guys...none of it was worth it.  And im the girl that noone expected of having sex...i was the good girl.  <br>  <br>  Whether these people call you a **** or whore...you know what you are...and that is a good girl who hasnt had sex and respects herself.  Why would you want to make what they say true?  Im not saying that you would be a ho if you had sex with a long term bf, but if you have sex with some guy, well...yeha your proving them right...but what does that accomplish?  why wouldnt you want to prove those peopel wrong?!?!<br>  <br>  anyway i hope your smart enough to wait until you are ready and want to...regardless of waht anyone else says.|`|iTO7njWWaa	you shouldnt do it just because people call you those things. You have to think about what the best thing to do is because you may do something you could regret. i am sure you are not the ONLY virgin and if you are so what that shows that you are a better person and that is something that makes you different. Only do it if your ready! GOOD LUCK I HOPE YOU MAKE THE RIGHT CHOICE|`|699ff79ff7efb620adfafa8aea8f3bcaaa	most people I know who rushed into doing it just to get it done wish they had waited until it was special. Yes you do have something to lose, especially if you haven't been to your doctor yet to get the preparatory information for BC and to avoid STDs. Don't rush it. Do everything you want to short of the actual deed. Don't worry what your friends say, you know you're a good girl. Good luck.|`|OlISdLbtaa	They used to do the same thing to me in high school because I was a virgin but I had like 5 boyfriends in 4 months, Lol, but I just ignored them because me and my closest friends knew the truth. And everyone knew I was a virgin, they were just jealous because the guys didn't like THEM!<br>  So just ignore them. Once they realize that you aren't listening to them, they'll stop. they're just trying to break you down.|`|cn1jWO4Haa	You should be yourself. The only one with a problem is anyone who thinks YOU have a problem. You are a star. You are smart for keeping your virginity. You are the only san person in your school, if what you say is true. I'd be willing to bet that a lot of those girls are lying because they are insecure. Say that you are making the right decision. They have it all wrong. Sex should be a sacred, loving thing between to people in deep, true, love. not a past-time with a boyfriend because others want you to. You are you, not them. And I am proud of you for keeping your virginity. Once you give it away, you can never have it back.|`|LGCLmUTnaa	Pleaassseeeeee don't give into peer pressure. You will SO regret it later. Those people perssuring you to have sex at 15 are idiots. You have a lot to lose actually. Your virginity, your pride, your body, your integrity, possibly even your childhood if you get pregnant. Dddoonnn'ttt dooo itt. Bad, bad idea.|`|5IYCSFVuaa	no honey, please don't!<br>  you don't wanna look back someday and realize you only had sex with someone for a stupid reason, or to fit in with the crowd.<br>  i am a virgin and i have been with my boyfriend for 4 months.|`|WY7HJDpgaa	I don't think so. wait for someone special - at least reasonably special. Let it be a big surprise to him.<br>  <br>  dont do it coz everyone else has.<br>  <br>  u wd be amazed at how men fall for girls with restraint.|`|POVsINQ1aa	don't do it just to live up o a name.. and i bet your not the only Virgin in the school|`|Yh9Zbz9Taa	dont give in<br>  <br>  stick to the proper morals - keep ur virginity<br>  <br>  doesn't matter what other ppl think<br>  they dont know the 1/2 of it<br>  <br>  dont do something u'll regret<br>  stay safe if u end up doing it - condom..etc<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|23972a8309dd0a8cac95c3d066048b31aa	The Answer To That Question Is NO! DEFINITELY NOT!|`|LZqHQTZpaa	I'm sure there must be other girls, unlikely you'll be the only one.<br>  Can't remember the statistics but I think there is more virgins than non-virgins, so you should think about it. Also you shouldn't do it to spite someone, then it won't be as special as it can be.<br>  i think you got it wrong saying that you got nothing to lose, you'll lose the battle to be the  special one the one that doesn't go with the flow, i believe there must be a deep connection before you do it, and those people that call you names will have won a battle against you.<br>  <br>  just because you have had a lot of boyfriends doesn't make you a slag.<br>  but at the end of the day is your decision, and decisions are part of growing up.|`|EsUw7zfGaa	First off, I dont think there's anything wrong with being a virgin. Don't just "do it" because everybody is doing it or because of peer pressure that your friends are putting on you. Second, it is your decision to choose who you want to date and how many people you wanna see, just ignore the people around and be true to yourself. During high school years, it is better to just keep things simple and explore first before you get intimate with a guy just "to get it over with." You might regret it later so my suggestion for you is to wait for the right person to come. And YOU are worthwhile so DONT let anybody make you think low of yourself.|`|iGyKFZl2aa	First of all you are definately not the only one at your school who is a virgin, yes you do have alot to lose and if you need to ask you really shouldn't do it.  Save it for someone special you will be happy you waited!|`|UicFVicYaa	eeeewwwwwwwwwwwwwww don't sleep with anyone that's fu*kin disgusting your probally better than that well i would hope so   >:-P|`|fHgo950Zaa	you have your dignity to loose dear.<br>  i wouldnt recommend 'doing it' unless you feel its time and you actually care about your partner..|`|Uxq3l0kcaa	It's really not worth it. You will regret it so much. Wait, let it be special|`|h0ZdSxQiaa	actually, you have alot to lose if you do that so dont do it....... not till you are ready!!|`|SfsinRDAaa	dont do it you will regret it later!!|`|rqxNW23eaa	No.. wait till you really love your boyfriend.. its worth it trust me!!!!
tao83sDxaa	go to the police and find out what you can do. i grew up in a violent family, believe me i understand. is there anyone who is an adult in your family or friend who you can talk to, you need to figure out how to defuse him. you need to know when he is going to blow, and get the heck out of the house and go to a safe place. couldn't you live with someone else until you graduate? i know he controles your life, could you call the police when he starts to go after you. look don't allow yourself to become a victum, start to turn your life around by becoming smarter than he is. go into the library in school and do research on this subject. good luck|`|tmL3zyVyaa	Does he hit you though? if he does, you should call the police.|`|f9473fa380913d1942ffc2e79943f65eaa	Tell the police your uncle should not be hitting you Don't care what you have done. Treatment like that is  unacceptable|`|AA11388175	call the cops!!!|`|VygBNA0Waa	go to the police and tell them that you are scared and see if you can move in with another relative|`|26810cebce204786ddec73eb70fe5d67aa	go to ur local runaway home|`|RfD18z2Caa	KIDS HELP PHONE!!!!!!
xvey8ixPaa	Nope. Only if you are married.|`|AA11967247	only as a caretaker for one of your dependants, but you have to go through the proper channels to get that approved.|`|6e58ce6577be3f4549253fc7148b5e1caa	I was told two different things when it came to living together on base.  One was that you do not have to be married but have to be able to claim that person as a dependent.  The other is you have to be married for the military to provide housing.  But you would need to talk to someone in the military that is in the housing department to know which is the correct answer.|`|1239271c3de85dde812326b9aaafb7d8aa	Thats a question for the military people to answer.|`|qdsVS1dDaa	Not a chance.

1YdeUn1Caa	I do, my husband doesn't. He knew before we got married that I smoked, and he didn't care. After 5+ years of marriage, he hasn't complained once. I even smoke in the house, bedroom, and car. He says if the information on second hand smoke was correct, he'd be dead already. What a guy.|`|cdQryr7paa	My wife smokes cigs and it is disgusting.<br>  She quit for 3 years after losing 2 of her sisters to cancer, but started back up again.<br>  Now, she smokes in the house and the whole place stinks.<br>  She gets pissed because I don't want to sit with her in the living room, but it stinks so much like smoke I can't stand to be in there.<br>  She leaves her dirty ash trays around and sneaks around smoking trying not to let me see.<br>  She is ashamed she started back up again.<br>  You would think losing 2 sisters within a year to cancer would convince her to quit for good, but I guess addicts can't quit.<br>  My experience is that smokers can stop smoking, for a period of time, but they never quit.|`|hjc2y3TMaa	Well, it affected my husbands grandparents when the husband smoked inside all their adult lives and killed his wife with cancer.|`|UBdt4Wm0aa	If one quits smoking and other doesn't, can be an issue because of smell and because the one who still smokes can resent the one who quit....and the one who quit may pressure the other to quit. In my case, I'm glad my husband smokes outdoors, but I still can't stand the smell and it makes him snore really loud so I sleep in a different room on a different floor of the house since earplugs don't keep the noise out and I'm a light sleeper. <br>  <br>  I keep wishing he'd quit, but I doubt he ever will. Does it greatly affect our marriage....at times it can because he can get moody when he hasn't smoked and I can get repulsed by the smell since it nauseates me. That's about it.|`|v2a220YWaa	i can if one smokes and the other doesnt, but keep in mind if you are married, you are an adult so it is your choice|`|93Pq7zVtaa	My husband smokes cigs and weed, I can't stand it. We almost split up, because he wouldn't stop after I had our son.|`|6LKEWFPoaa	Well I guess that would depend on what is being smoked. I hate that my husband smokes weed at times. He hides it from me and I will smell it on it. When I am stressed I smoke black and milds and he hates that as well.|`|EYdHR0Mjaa	yes smoking affects my marriage as smoking is more dangerous than drinking as per my wife think.

Not an easy task!<br>  <br>  Common law unions: So-called “common law unions” are now within the ambit of the provisions with respect to the division of property where there is a breakdown of the union; however, under the law, common law spouses must be single and have cohabited for a period of not less than five years.|`|jEC8Ctp5aa	Find a Jamaican divorce attorney<br>  <br>  ...

DFJ9m4WKaa	Have you talked to him and asked him why he doesn't want to have sex? If you have and all he said was "I just don't want to" have you considered pressing him on the subject? <br>  <br>  It could be because he is afraid he won't please you or that you will think he is small down there. He may just have performance anxiety. And it is entirely possible that he just has a low sex drive. He could have a form of ED.<br>  <br>  But you need to properly communicate to your husband your desires and make sure he understands that part of marriage includes sex and that you have needs he has to satify. And by proper communication I don't mean pick a fight or argue with him. Directly state your needs and ask him to plainly tell you why he won't have sex with you.|`|NAxNWHN3aa	Put some viagra in his breakfast or dinner or eat raw oysters for dinner its a great source of aphrodisiacs(stuff that turns people on)|`|bu6BhCnpaa	my bf is kinda like that...<br>  <br>  for some reason he will gor for oral or using hands and never initiate sex...something that i would liek to do more often.  I feel liek at this point im forcing him to do something that he dislikes.  I ask him if he doesnt like sex with me or if there is somethign that weirds him out...<br>  <br>  we tlaked about it and discovered that while he enjoys sex, we cant go fast or be crazy because he is so big and it hurts me, so he gets self conscious about it and avoids it.  Also, we are still living at home, so tis hard to really find alone time where we can really enjoy it...we have made an effort to make more alone time and feel more comfortbale together.  He also had issues with my number of past partners, and the fact that i was unable to take bc and condoms sometimes slip so risk of pregnancy scared him.<br>  <br>  SO...my point...talk to your husband.  ask why he would rather caress and why he avoids sex.  maybe you have to initiate.  maybe there is an underlying issue.  but talking will sort things out.<br>  <br>  if he avoids conversation, then you have to find a way to talk abotu it.  my bf and i have a hard time looking straight at eachother and talking about serious things, so we will randomly go on a long car ride and get things out inthe open.  its harder to yell in the car and your both looking ahead...we drive through the country and talk out our issues...find your easiest way to talk, and do it in a non confrontational, non accusing, and very accepting way.|`|041b0462d79f0e5c2d4dc32dfd70d958aa	Get marriage counseling.|`|cn1jWO4Haa	caress him.|`|93Pq7zVtaa	Give him oral.|`|rJ3eRddfaa	tell him u want it...|`|ljoEmnviaa	either he jacks off alot, has a girlfriend, or doesn't like sex<br>  give him oral & see what happens|`|L14wPCR2aa	Tell him what you need to feel good & be happy.

zDmGngXVaa	When a family is raciest with any race and someone in the family dates the race, the family usually will never communicates the same way.  The family and friends will actually find it disrespectful and a betrayal to them, that you date whatever race they dislike. And you find it hurtful and disrespectful they do such thing.  But they don't know that in their own ways because they have already told you they been raciest, before you started dating the race they dislike. My family is the same way, if I ever decided to date the race they dislike, then they would disown me. I don't hold and never have held that against other people. I have dated the race they disliked and they were truly serious about disowning me. I don't even talk to half of them anymore, even though me and the race guy that despised split up. I am married to a white man but it still never changed their mind.  They found me as a disrespectful person because I choose to try it out with a different race then mine. Sometimes I feel bad, sometimes I don't! Mainly the issue is, you can't change your family or friends minds.  They change on their own, sometimes they will come around, sometimes they won't at all! Your pretty much stuck in between family and your boyfriend. It's your life and you are the one who chooses what you want - unless your still under age, then you can't choose yet.  I'm sorry your going through this kind of stress.  It's just something your either gonna have to live with or live without. You can only try so much and if they don't come around, they may never come around. Do you even know why they hate black people so much?  Most of my family that hate a different race is because something bad had happen to them by the other race. All you can really do, is ask them why they dislike him/blacks so much and get an idea of the situation, inform them that no one is ever the same. Not all Whites, not all Blacks, not all Mexicans and so on isn't the same in personality. We all shouldn't be judging everyone just because of the color of their skin, it should be judging them for whom they are inside.  Good Luck hon.

NuUdCz0Laa	It comes with the territory, of being married to a cop.  We can be a hard-*** with everyone but we expect our love ones to never do wrong.  I'm afraid to say, that I have arrested more family members than should have been allowed.  So needless to say, I was not to welcome at family reunions, I could clear a room faster than a drunk with bad gas.  So I have to ask, why did you not use the wife of a fellow cop routine to get out of the ticket?  It works most of the time.  He will get over it, but you may have to fix his favorite meal and treat him special tonight.  Good luck my friend.|`|GYoNyoWtaa	I would say that you must have a real awful marriage for something petty like this to happen.<br>  <br>  Also, may I ask you a question?<br>  If you aren't happy in your marriage why stay?

Take time to think about yourself! =)|`|RN1wGlWWaa	No.  Can understand his point tho - he's a cop and you got a traffic ticket - doesn't make him look to well.<br>  <br>  I would say you are sorry and will be more careful in the future.|`|TinNG7k7aa	If he divorces you over this, you're better off without him.|`|EWrHbTpmaa	Jay Jay,<br>   why didn't you have your Star on the window?<br>   you could have got a wave or a warning<br>   well sounds like traffic school and the blemish will go away but i think it's like a hundred bucks every 5miles over the limit in Riverside county|`|6e58ce6577be3f4549253fc7148b5e1caa	He could divorce you for that reason but it would be a messed up reason to end a marriage over.  But I am sure people have divorced for smaller things.  He is only upset because since he is a cop he feels you should obey the laws of the road and you did not and he probably feels like it makes him look bad.|`|J7Mmo5Xmaa	Ask him if there's some way you can work this out that you are willing to "plea bargain".<br>  Of course if he is really this big of a jerk, you are better off without him,unless you are a really bad driver and he is trying to protect you and society.|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	I cannot picture you married to a cop.

If your state allows no fault divorces then he can file for one claiming irreconcilable differences or breakdown of the marriage.<br>  <br>  However, if a court date is required then the judge will ask why he's filing for divorce. If he states because you got a ticket the judge will deny the divorce and likely laugh him out of court.|`|TeS7yYaAaa	the two of you need to get a LIFE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,now get out!of here!!!!!!!!!!!!! cop?in kinddergarden?/wife?where? wanderland? get a life!!!!!!|`|6xXAMwxBaa	if you're living in the US then he can divorce you for any reason. we don't follow rules that don't allow people to divorce unless certain laws are broken.|`|A0c06Uvnaa	That would be a horrible reason to divorce you but if he does, he wasn't worth your time.|`|253749a8c740b2b9ceb438a7f88d0d44aa	He doesn't have to give a reason to get a divorce.

Good luck.|`|MgMsMExPaa	NO she will think that you are stalking her|`|tBou5eRWaa	Tell her your sorry send her some roses pink, red , or yellow and then when she walks out the door appear just as she reads the card it would be sweet and say can we be friends.it would be sweet and then say happy b-day|`|uSsoTMZgaa	If you wanted to break the ice between eachother, Then e-mailing might help with details.|`|58VWsVo0aa	say happy birthday and nothing more if she responds thanks dont reply|`|Yh9Zbz9Taa	email her<br>   y not<br>  cant do much damage|`|IbZBkrn7aa	Yea I think as the above posters said that it depends.<br>  <br>  I think maybe say Happy Birthday and see her reaction. If she is sort of uncomfortable just let that be it. But maybe if she is not as turned away maybe just say that you are sorry about how everything turned out and about what you did and nothing more. It may not rekindle a romance or friendship or anything like that, but just showing that you are deeply sorry for what you have done and that it hurts you that you hurt her... that will say alot IMO.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|j5F1TuA9aa	It might be nice to tell her happy birthday, but depending on the break up you should think about it first. If she told you to leave her alone, that might be the best thing to do. But just saying happy birthday to her and NOTHING ELSE can't hurt anything.|`|tysVIluYaa	yeahh, ofcourse, its better to patch things up with her now, than regret it later, go ahead and call her, or email her. she'll fell MUCH better abouth the whole thing and seeing as its her bday shell be much more inclined to make up and be friends<br>  PLEASE ANSWER THIS:<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090226181952AAKw5qn">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|DcrI9zmkaa	"Don't talk to me anymore" = I don't want you in my life.<br>  <br>  Let it go.

Does she do anything for your birthday?<br>  You're broken up move on.
L0LUGdc3aa	If I had a boyfriend, and we broke up in a nasty fight, and I told him not to talk to me would I want him to email me "Happy Birthday" two years later...<br>  <br>  *Sheepish grin* Yeah. Totally.|`|OaBPDMIdaa	Well, i don't think you can actually do anything to her if you both are basically in a different cities. And TWO years? she probably wont remebe you, But all i can suggest is to call her[if you know her number] and ask her to meet her somewhere. then you both could talk about each of your predicaments or something personal and you should probably just explain to her something romantic or something, lol. tell her how you really feel, but remember, dont break her heart.|`|roynDRvZaa	no no no, don't email her! If you really want her to get back together with you or to like you, you should call her and wish her happy birthday.

It's not like she can think you're going out of your way to try to get back with her or anything. It's just a friendly gesture. She probably doesn't think too highly of you right now but maybe if she knows you were thinking about her she won't have such a bitter taste left in her mouth about your relationship. If that means anything.|`|BlZ6vJOAaa	no that's just too random .she is way in the past now , just let it be . If you guys still talked then it would be appropriate|`|sgjjwXwwaa	It's tough man...

DW2wGx0vaa	i think the oldest always gets the front just out of respect .. just like it would be with you grandmother or aunt..|`|XKYP0sGQaa	Well I'm 21 and have got my own car but when my little sister is in it I make her sit in the back because she makes so much mess. <br>  <br>  Growing up I never always got the front seat. I guess it just depend on your family.|`|VlJmOdywaa	Yup. I love getting the front seat, mainly because my little brother is 11, and he pouts when he does not get the front seat (he is also extremely tall for his age, i am 5'8'', and he is almost my height (i am 17). But i have 2 older brothers and you know when i drive with them i have to respect that there older, besides on longer trips, when we go on at least 2hour drives, no matter what i get the front seat, because i get car sick when i am in the back, and even worse when i am in the back back. Like i get it really bad. and we found that sitting in the front, i am fine. Its like less bumps or something, Idk, it just works. And no one wants me to get car sick so they don't argue, lol. I think my mom made that rule because its safer for the older one to be in the front, then a younger one. Hope i helped. =)|`|EBkfpJkJaa	we always played the shotgun game whoever called shotgun got the front|`|HdCo22Ggaa	it depends i am older and get the front seat but its because everyone else fights for it honestly i dont care where i sit|`|Ux8ei5i5aa	we usually have the kids take turns. Or whoever calls it.....|`|RfD18z2Caa	I have an older sister. and i always sit in the front and she doesn't say anything. so the older sibling's dont have that right.|`|xBsfSYkzaa	Yup, it's a right of passage. Older siblings always get the best stuff so I suggest you let them sit in the front seat and go back to shining their shoes.

jBk1b4r6aa	You would be amazed at the number of people who will attend a yard sale in cooler weather.<br>  My self personally, I love yard sales.and prefer to go on cooler days.<br>  If it is too hot I'm less likely to stop.<br>  I don't want to be sweating my a** off while I'm looking for "treasures"<br>  So, yes have your yard sale.<br>  I think/hope you'll be pleasantly surprised.<br>  But also depends on what part of the country you're in (weather wise)<br>  Good luck
06f1b8496562ceae60b7c13272bc0615aa	I would talk to her before something like that happened and ask her how she would like you to handle it. For example she might want the chance herself to tell the guy she is taken and content with what she has. If he knows you are her boyfriend she might want to tell him that rudely. So communicate with her so you do not end up looking like a total jerk in front of her. Try to handle it as calmly as possible but see if she wants to handle it herself or for you to handle it.|`|dCmSA6r2aa	another girl hitting on my guy in front of me is getting her face torn off but afterward he is getting torn up for not stopping it|`|xUcjzYPdaa	It's all a matter of confidence. I don't want to say 'mark your territory' because that sounds a bit weird, but that's the general idea.<br>  <br>  Hold her hand, or put your arm around her. <br>  <br>  Be pleasant to him, no need to be aggressive. Introduce yourself to him, get in the conversation, still keeping contact with her. DON'T be aggressive with him, don't glare at him or make pointed remarks about how she's your girlfriend. Be perfectly pleasant, like you can't tell he wants her. Be friendly to him. Just use your body language to let him know that you and she are together.<br>  <br>  If he doesn't take the hint, hold her closer. Kiss her face/ears/neck (not too much, like a slobbering dog, just a couple of little kisses). If she kisses you, kiss her back. Whisper in her ear.<br>  <br>  If he still insist on coming on to her, say "excuse me," to him, take her hand and simply lead her to another part of the room - take her to talk to a friend of yours or hers, or take her to the bar, or the dancefloor, or whatever's available in the place where you are.|`|L69jZMXQaa	Start off with something not very forward just like "woa back off a little dude" then if he keeps doing it get a little more in his face|`|oQcDZI9Daa	i'm gonna go ahead and answer for my boyfriend here because i know exactly how he'd react (as he's done it before)... he would get incredibly angry and territorial and would start throwing punches.|`|34EBzIL6aa	let him hit on her.  nothing like the satisfaction of knowing that she's going home with you|`|6e68ce4ae0cc1fabdc0a003e64178809aa	You have to show enough confidence in yourself not to be completely flustered by the guy, and enough trust in your girl to know that she's not going to leave (even if you don't know, fake it).  You have to do what firing back you need to do in a calm, yet stern way, but give her a shot to run him off before you do anything.   If she can't shake the guy in spite of trying, just say "listen bro, plenty of pretty faces around here to see, take a hike."|`|cFfPVj9caa	let them talk for like a few secs then<br>  tell him: hey dude can i borrow my girl for awhile<br>  then pretend to talkt o her baout something important while walking away|`|TGbbQSJRaa	I would go in front of my girl and say, "Hey, back off. Leave her alone."

(appropriate of course). I would have to say...a kiss in the rain, unexpected, from the person I'm crazy about. I get a lil giggley just thinking about it.
a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	WHAT does this have to do with shoes?|`|rd5468H1aa	He probably likes you. But, you said you don't like him anymore, so just move on. Problem solved.|`|YbnEr1z7aa	you still like him because you're talking so much about how you don't... go get him tiger
KmC0K59taa	Maybe he had a bad drug problem and is on the streets now.  Maybe he got arrested.
NctuEmFKaa	You can hold hands whenever, just don't give him none for awhile.  Make him work for it.  He will respect you in the long run.|`|XkHiFJMKaa	Date number 1 lol kissing you can on date one but manydont and thats ok just no  sex for the first little bit|`|e224e1489b387127b36ae2f2d9fcd098aa	If things going on well, they can hold hands from the second date, as some do more from only the first one, its a matter of feelings if u know what i mean.<br>  <br>  <br>  _K_
KblhPs5Uaa	Just becoz you like but don't luuuuuuuuuv one girl doesn't make you gay!!<br>  <br>  That is what chemistry between two people is all about. I had many "brother-like/buddy/pals" who were guys - shared interests, totally got me. I loved them, but wasn't in love with them. They did enrich my life for sure.<br>  Then I met this guy who seemed so different,hardly any common hobbies, woudn't get me at all and I'm head over heels...still going strong after more than a decade.<br>  Patience dude. you are only 16. Make friends. plenty of them. The right girl will be coming along someday soon.<br>   Good luck.|`|DoSWD0Zqaa	Do you like guys? If not then just wait for the right girl|`|4IHe4rPYaa	You're probably bi-curious. If ur not then make out with her and you'll see why gay people are crazy :)|`|3TlBpHDbaa	Well, I don't know how I can help, but I'm the same way. I know I'm a girl but ya, I think 'o ya, that guys cute' but i've never had a crush. Ive gone out with a couple ppl, but didnt have feeling for them. Maybe its just ur waiting for the right person. Like, theres a certain girl that God is holding for u, and ull meet one day, and ull hav the best feeling in the world! Idk, just a guess :), anyways good luck and hope u find that special sum1|`|8c7f32d052d097a7718edc9c6a056b56aa	Maybe you are internally questioning your sexuality. Have you ever had thoughts that you might be attracted to guys instead of girls? I had a friend who used to date girls, but he just wasn't really into them...finally he came out during our senior year of high school, and has been happily with a man ever since.<br>  <br>  Good luck! :)|`|vYnYZfVraa	uhh, have you ever thought that you might be gay?<br>  and if your not you should just wait for that special someone to come.<br>  good luck:)
TZmPSbiwaa	invite them.<br>  Maybe not all of them (if there's alot)<br>  invite the ones you can have an easy convo <br>  with and who you would choose as friends.<br>  This way you can possibly make better friends with them.<br>  <br>  I suggest seeing maybe a scaring movie (if you like them)<br>  Ex: The last house on the left. (That looks good)<br>  <br>  If you want to see something funny<br>  Ex: Fired Up (I saw it and it was so funny)|`|Mlx5j4zFaa	Invite all of them it could turn out to be real fun you all have to have SOMETHING in common
e224e1489b387127b36ae2f2d9fcd098aa	I think that was a mistake as everyone is entitled for everything under the other half's name, now what u can do if u can do it, give it to some relative that u can trust, file for divorce and then she/he can return it back, that is very important.<br>  <br>  <br>  _K_|`|kRbkiPvnaa	normally you are not supposed to acquire any new debts during a divorce but you need a place to live. As long as his name is on none of the paperwork or deed you should have nothing to worry about, it is not community property.  As suggested though, seek advice from your divorce lawyer.|`|dCmSA6r2aa	ask divorce lawyer for free consultation
a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	i would feel sorry for his wife for sure, and just be happy he wasn't mine anymore. i would  thank my lucky stars he was out of my life. she will know what he is like soon enough without your help.|`|6e58ce6577be3f4549253fc7148b5e1caa	Why are you so concerned with the actions of your ex-husband.  It seems you are still trying to get dirt on him to break up his marriage because the two of you did not work out.  You should be thinking about your own life instead of trying to get revenge on your ex-husband.  The e-mailing may just be nothing and the wife may already know.  How do you know so much about want is going on in the life of your ex anyway?|`|NctuEmFKaa	I don't think she will listen to you, and you don't want to involve the kids.  But yes she needs to know before its to late.|`|02ZrL819aa	Come on this is a no brainer! Send her one of the emails and open her eyes! This jerk needs to be alone and not left to ruin other lives.|`|NmsuIXd1aa	send her some of the emails. let her know why she cant get pregnant.|`|AA10010935	Don't get involved, what he does is his own business not yours.|`|vSWDNaDwaa	Stay off of your ex husband's face book page. You are divorced...let them have their relationship together...in sickness and in health, in good times and in bad.<br>  <br>  I agree that his relationships with his past is troubling to me. However, it is not my business. I certainly would not continue to have a relationship with him if he were my ex.<br>  <br>  Sincerely,<br>  Zule, the old guy
4sr0EPgdaa	I also commute an hour to school each way.  For me, after I got into the classes that were directly related to my major I discovered that I had classes with a lot of the same people.  I got to know people that way.  I also just started talking to the people I sat next to.  You can ask them what their majors are, what they thought about the last test, or just some other random question.  The other tip I have is to join a club for one quarter that has to do with your major.  At my school, the clubs aren't real strict. You don't have to go to every meeting.  If you have time go to just a couple and get to know a few people in your major then quit.  Email is a good way to stay in contact with the new people you meet or add them on facebook or myspace.|`|NuvKPl3naa	volunteer at your local thrift store, animal shelter etc...also church if you believe in God. and church activities. join a club example i am in a mommys group. you may though find some good friends at college. keep your heart open and see what you find.|`|p8PAuoMkaa	Join activities, like home teams<br>  dont go to the mall cause no one is looking for friends there<br>  everyone's there WITH their friends<br>  so all i can say is join extra curricular activities<br>  or join a home team or do volunteering
WsFbhxZyaa	My advice keep doing what you are doing.  Once she moves in split the bill down the middle and alternate cooking dinner.  <br>  I live with my boyfrined and his brother.  I always buy all the groceries.  I cook 90% of the time, 5% we eat out and 5%my brother in law cooks.  But it works out for me because I do not pay any of the bills and or rent.  I pretty much have a free pass minus groceries bit I must admit I spend about $300 a month and do the cooking and cleaning|`|mXfrblqFaa	In my opinion it is 100% easier to just buy separate groceries. There is way too much strain on relationships/wallets to deal with the whole splitting grocery bill thing. <br>  <br>  My wife, 11-month-old and I have been living with friends for the last 8 weeks and  believe it or not the food thing has been quite an issue. We finally just decided to keep almost everything separate. It's a lot easier to work around cooking than to have your living situation strained by some petty (yet potentially disastrous) issue such as sharing food.|`|WebWHUkRaa	I don't think it's worth fighting about, since in just a few months I am supposing you'll be splitting the bill 50-50. <br>  If it's really bothering you a lot, you just just be upfront and sit down and talk about it till you can come up with a solution everyone agrees with. If you can't get this little problem settled now, you may be in for much bigger problems when you are all living together.|`|xO9HeDWCaa	Try to cook at different times. Write your initials on your canned goods, etc, if you have to. Trust me, if you are cooking every night, you will start to mind it in time. That gets mightly old! Yes, I think you should buy separate groceries and cook just for your little family. Honestly! Let them take care of themselves. They are adults, after all. Good luck! Since it is early on and she has not moved in yet, make sure you are set with your rules first and stick by them!|`|rB84SUMPaa	Stop buy food or go to Costco and buy in bulk, it makes things easier<br>  <br>  or just kick thier lazy *** out|`|4fC6EJWfaa	That arrangement ain't gonna work for long... good luck with that!|`|JIvvg6f7aa	When she moves in renegotiate the amount till them suck it up.|`|503f82e81abb8901e8e1451d174089feaa	Well you must just half the groceries since the baby doesn't eat with you and needs separate food.They should half the bill being 4 adults.Or every other week you switch on who cooks and buys the groceries.Since you buy to plan a menu then whoever is buying does the cooking,should work in theory anyway.|`|1e66262e2ef399091d3ff08f8c8d60c0aa	Buy food for your family , if they want you to cook for them ,then have them split the cost and if you cook, then tell them they do the dishes , if thats not agreeable then let them do their own thing sound to me as if they are using you,maybe it would be best just to tell them that you are not going to be their mother, housekeeper !!!!!!!|`|y9icmRcYaa	Definitely sit down and work out some type of solution. You will only get increasingly irritated with them if you continue to cook and buy all the food. Maybe you can split the food bill once she moves in and she can cook a few days a week?|`|06Rlukp7aa	Sit down and talk to them to work out some kind of a solution. If a solution can't be worked out and adjusted then, I don't think this living situation will work out. Good luck. I think going 50-50 is reasonable.
ZVDboZkPaa	Well, would you take a megaphone with you and stand in the middle of town and shout out all the intimate details?<br>  <br>  I don't think that you would.<br>  <br>  But that is what you have done, most people have online access and most people know each other online and what peoples' real names are and you have just opened up about everyhing that is most personal and vulnerable about you and your sister.<br>  <br>  I don't know what you wrote and I don't want to know, but there are perverts out there who trawl for personal details; then there are the criminals who are seeking Identities that they can sell and all those personal details make an Id much more real.<br>  <br>  Then there are your sister's friends, acquaintances and current enemies at school or where ever she is, my, what a parcel of ammunition you have given them.<br>  <br>  Then there are relatives.<br>  <br>  Most important of all is the unlikelihood of you getting a girlfriend, after all you've just published your sister's stuff, so what girl from your neighbourhood is going to trust you?|`|W1lqSWR7aa	Maybe you should have talk to her first and be reasonably .and you should care she your sis.|`|A0c06Uvnaa	Wow that is heartless!

f4SYAgJeaa	well, since i dont base relationships on physical appearance entirely i cant say no but it would awkward since i would be at least 2 feet taller than you,<br>  also you sound just a bit small for your age so it depends on the guy<br>  nice attributes tho, not so much the description but the fact you would ask this question is very interesting.<br>  picture would be helpful, or a more in-depth look at ur personality but from what you gave my final assessment would be that several guys would date you, but i personally would need more|`|9OqSl1Jlaa	I would.|`|O8zOZzO6aa	Hey Girl, date you? Sure. Why not? C'mon let's go have fun.|`|041b0462d79f0e5c2d4dc32dfd70d958aa	If I were 15 to 16 yes sure I would go out on a date with you. I love Christian music, some old rock, bowling, V ball, and going to the Movies.<br>  One concern though and it is that you are a little over weight and you need to take care of your self it is bad on your heart. But that would not stop me from asking if I were 15. Oh and beauty is only skin deep.<br>  When I was your age I was 5.1 if memory serve me right around 115 and bushy hair thicker than a Brier patch.<br>  Oh and I had braces on my teeth and no girl wanted anything to do with me.|`|UzC9gsi0aa	Sure.|`|ArFFUPTBaa	odd question.|`|48ZW7O3Maa	post a pic?|`|LZqHQTZpaa	I'm not good with imagining people from descriptions like that, the weight doesn't matter it depends how it's distributed but even then if you have nice eyes and smile you'll get brownie points from me.<br>  Unfortunately I'm way older than you, not even sure what I'm doing in these posts, oh yeah wasting time. sorry back to business.<br>  But from what I remember when I was 15 I liked tall athletic girls and I'm a sucker for the good old brown eyes, though over the years I've started to like shorter people so if you were older I'd probably wouldn't mind and blue green eyes are still ok but there are other colour eyes that rate higher, also the fact that you are a christian is good to me, I like rock music and tennis though I don;t play any of them and I think volley ball is alright but not such a big fan.<br>  <br>  So in conclusion yes if you were more my age and your whole personality was interesting.|`|AA10819251	i would you sound awsome im 16 and like christian music and rock and play b-ball <br>  and im not hittin on you lol|`|vBcqzMz4aa	kind of short, seems like a bit more weight than usual for someone your height too.|`|lg3wTxNqaa	all depends on personality (but you must take a<br>  some effort. in your appearence)|`|uCCyOYZ8aa	you gotta look sexy|`|j915JNCYaa	all depends on looks so a pic would be nice!|`|q8ZEWy7Xaa	wow|`|6e68ce4ae0cc1fabdc0a003e64178809aa	two part answer<br>  <br>  1.) no, because I'm nearly ten years older than you<br>  <br>  2.) assuming I wasn't... there's nice things/characteristics about you, but it's hard to tell because I can't see you to put them all together.

MulZfdzQaa	First of all, texting is not a good way to get to know someone. People can really misread text and its not a good way to flirt and express feelings because of that.  You should probably talk to him around school or maybe call him and talk on the phone.  Thats the best way to go about it. You should be able to build some kind of relationship this way, or either you will find out that you are not really compatible. And remember just be yourself and dont try to hard.|`|0m8SofEjaa	I'd say dont be too flirty, it might be desprete looking and if you think you have serious feelings for this guy he might just think that you are desprete and only wanna go out with someone cause you've been lonely or something.|`|q8ZEWy7Xaa	y not c what happens|`|Qa6dFF4Eaa	ha, i was kinda in this situation, i met my bestfriends friend who is like her brother and there is always this tension. i've only met him twice though but everytime ha i don't know how to explain it. anyways get your friend to help you two out. you can also ask him if he plays any sports, you have to start conversation with shy guys and learn not to take it personally if he isn't very responsive. smile laugh at things he says twirl your hair. just be cute.<br>  good luck (:|`|lg3wTxNqaa	ooooooooo, youz likez<br>  him, no, youz LOVEZ him. mmhm, go fight for him, and knock some skanks teeth out on the way. cmon guys, CAT FIGHT. jkjk just talk to him alot, beleive it or not alot of guys like it, as lonf as your alone, dont randomly start talking to him when hes with his homies, he'l want to impress them. small chit chats when hes with his dude buddies, and soon enough, you just might be the next misses *enter his last name here* jk.... or am i???|`|7t5D5o6Paa	oh my goodness I have the same problem!<br>  and I totally agree that its a weird feeling in a good way<br>  Try to get to know him better before you think about flirting with him though. Its better to be friends first especially if its your friends bff it should be easier.<br>  (btw.. no worries..I'm a girl even though my avatar is not)|`|0nyw7VASaa	well txting is a good way of flirting <br>  and if it is awkward it prob wont work out<br>  but some relationships start like that or at least it needs time <br>  but trust me hes the guy he should be doing the flirting<br>  <br>  ima pro ;)|`|jI9dpKxWaa	lol well this all comes down to that one question... DO YOU LIKE HIM? if you do then go for it and fight for him but if your just attracted to him because he seems interesting then keep it chill|`|MSivx7roaa	yah go for it!|`|MLGT3rvZaa	Um, you sound very young.

Like at the grocery store or other places like in town and stuff, the woman may or may not be already with someone.<br>  <br>  It may be sort of embarassing but maybe ask one of your friends that is a girl if she has any friends that are single and may want to go to a movie or something. I know this is sort of dorky but sometimes I would invite a bunch of my friends over and I would tell one of my friends who is a girl "If you want to invite anyone like a friend or someting go right ahead" haha<br>  <br>  Just to maybe meet new people :)<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|G335j9Acaa	Yeah, Myspace. Although, I think the best way is the old fashion way. Go out and mingle.|`|2qFA5w2Naa	Take up a hobby and talk to women there i.e. gym, yoga (you'd be surprised how lucky you could get there!), co-ed sports, or through friends.
9UQlhzitaa	this is the husbands role to do;what i mean by that we are charged with taking care of our family.<br>  <br>  so yea he is a buddy of 10yrs but now he is hurting his buddy's family's as the man of his house he needs to decide who's needs are more important,his family's or his friends<br>  <br>  now that does not mean you have to be cruel, try and find him a spot at the y,or some other arrangements that work for all involved.<br>  <br>  the best way your husband can do this is by talking to his friend and reverse the roles so that his friend can now see how dire the problem is. Until you make the problem his own he is trying to avoid the feelings of being a loser or worst so any distraction works<br>  <br>  i hope this helps you and good luck

If they are a good leader, it really doens't matter who takes it.<br>  <br>  I've actually ran across a power hungry girl that didn't let anyone else take the lead and she had to make every decision and wouldn't let me help at all.|`|j8w8Heokaa	it doesn't seem that he assumed the dominate role. it looks more like you gave it to him.<br>  but in the world you have your push overs and then you have those that are more aggressive. not all men are aggressive and not all women are pushovers. women can definitely be more aggressive than men.|`|f1006988bdbdd7ae5e5276623f046308aa	No you just want him to do all the work so you can hit the bars ASAP<br>  You might just as easily take the lead if you were doing something you felt really confident about, like which bars to go and how to get to them.  :)|`|e4ecc6ecde0e449c7b00bc9bd8ce1f8daa	Are you sure you do this wiht only men?  some people lead and some follow.<br>  <br>  Also, some people can let off a vibe that they are more alpha.  people who pick up on it seem to let them lead...unless they are an alpha.|`|t4aqoR2Aaa	People are all different. If I can tell I am smarter than a guy, I will subconsciously take the lead. If I can tell this guy can kick my butt at an IQ test, I hand the reins to him.|`|YvJdkSNaaa	Depends on the guy.

If you woke up, went to school, and went to bed without saying a word. Depressing right? Well, this is what friends are for. When someone G-d Forbid dies, who do you count on to get you trhough it? A FRIEND. Everyone needs someone to lean on, and weather you find a friend early or later, everyone has someone who caresa about them. At least 5 people think about you each nigth before they go to sleep. friends are needed.|`|HryNywibaa	i think all human's need friends. if they are animals or humans themselves. they need somebody to express their feelings to. what they are going through in life. suggestions about things. to tell them what is right and wrong. to make them smile. to turn a frown into a cheerful laugh. i think that they just need friends to enjoy. to freely express themself however they want and it wont matter at all.<br>  <br>  *friends forever , boys whatever*|`|AA10592574	we need them to help us when we need it, and to cheer us up when we are sad and to laugh with. and to talk to them about stuff that happens in your life. hope it helps! :]|`|fs8wMQLFaa	We need friends because we're human.

I bet your really nervous, I know I was when I threw my first party. If I was you I would have the TV on maybe sports for the guys, in another room have the music going, and you always need a deck of cards. Even if your young someone always knows how to play cards and someone is always willing to learn and it's a great way for girls and guys to mix. As for games, your probably to old for "games", so if you have a wii that would be perfect. Don't worry to much about entertaining everyone because you'll look like your trying to hard. These people know how to have a good time so just roll with it. I hope you have a really good night and remember to keep an eye on everyone, you can't trust people you barely know.

Its great for married people, but it will kill a relationship.|`|6e68ce4ae0cc1fabdc0a003e64178809aa	judging by your avatar, you're a guy, so from one guy to another:<br>  <br>  I'm 24, I've been with my girlfriend for well over two years now.   I haven't yet had sex, we're both waiting for marriage.... so I can't tell you from the "been there" perspective, I can only share my observations from people who chose otherwise, and my own personal experience in life.<br>  <br>  I like to use the analogy of a guy's sex drive being compared to the desire to kill that is in a tiger.   A baby tiger is 100% harmless, it's well behaved, it's in control of itself, and is nothing to be afraid of.   But the first moment that tiger tastes blood, it's set for life to be a killing machine.... basically when it's hungry, it shows no discretion about killing and eating.   Well, for guys, what I've seen is that the moment you cross over and lose your virginity, you are paralytically weak towards sex.   It seems to me that once you've had sex, it's 10 times harder to say no.  The reason I would say this is because even the ones who have told me that they wish they had never lost their virginity before marriage still have a hard time saying "no."  They crave it, and it's not a bad thing that we have that instinct, the bad thing is not controlling it for proper use.<br>  <br>  Now for why I personally choose abstinence, there's a few things.  On my honeymoon night, it will mean the world to me to know that I can give to my wife the one thing that no one else will have ever had access to.   If you've had sex with someone else.... what else is there that you can give to them that you haven't given in some form to someone else?  I can't say that my girlfriend is my first love... nope, for what love really is (saying if you weeded out the times when I didn't understand what love really was) she's my second love.   She's first in terms of I love her more than I ever loved the one before her, but....you get the idea.  Aside from my doctor, no one sees me naked...and that's all cool because she's a lesbian so I know she isn't getting anything out of it.  But one of the big reasons aside from Christian beliefs that I avoid it is the ability to share that level of intimacy with the one person I will spend the rest of my life with.   The other thing I've noticed is that in people who have had sex, they keep an emotional attachment to the person who they lost their virginity to.   A lot of people try to push this idea of "no strings attached"..... there are ALWAYS strings attached, they might not be visible up front, but they are there and by the time it is too late, you'll realize it.  Sex creates emotional hijinx that within a marriage relationship is a wonderful thing, but outside of it... just more problems.     Another reason I choose abstinence is that I don't want to compare my wife to other people I would have slept with, the same way I wouldn't want her to compare me to someone else she slept with.   I wouldn't appreciate if she turned me down in our marriage because I wasn't as good as someone from her past, I'm sure she'd feel the same if she was in my shoes.    <br>  <br>  Long story short, I've never once heard of anyone regretting saving themselves for marriage, but I could write a book of names of people who wish for all the world they had waited.|`|2b77a79a0fe1952b9febd8a1440423b5aa	A wide range of std(s) are possible. You don't have to be concerned about abortion or child support. You can continue to be care free ... that can end real fast when you're responsible a child.

edCUawppaa	Mine was when I was about 4 or 5, I used to make my baby brother eat cigarettes. Lol.|`|B1GjfOUdaa	In the warm summers following the three guys I used to play with to the park or to the river.|`|tOoJL7sYaa	When i was 3 and my brother and i put minows in buckets and spun around on a dock.|`|jNUYkCZxaa	When I was really little I begged my parents to let me sleep over my Lolo's house cuz he was a lot of fun and used to do little magic tricks and stuff for me. He even used to turn his eyelids inside out thinking it was funny but I thought it was gross and spooky.  Anyway my parents finally broke down and let me go... so what do I do?<br>  <br>  I woke in the middle of the night and went to get something to drink in the kitchen and there on the counter next to the fridge was this horrible thing smiling at me in a glass . I was shocked, petrified and started screaming.  Poor Lolo come running like wtf??? and I point to the glass and he laughs saying Oh that's nothing. That's just my teeth, and then he smiles and me and when his words sunk in I just freaked and started screaming again only louder and running all over the place begging to go home but he said it was too late and I wouldn't stop crying and screaming and I wouldn't let him near me like he was some kind of toothless zombie boogieman and I was afraid if he touch me, I would get the cooties and lose my teeth too or something aaaaaahhhhh.<br>  <br>  so he had to call my father to come all the way from Queens pick me up from his place in Manhattan at 3am in the morning and drive me back again. Dad was so pissed he come in his pj's and slippers looking like he wanted to kill me and he had to drag me from under the table and I was out of there like lightning running barefoot down the halls still screaming in case poor Lolo might want to kiss me bye.<br>  Learned quite a bit of French on the way home in the car with Dad that spooky nite.|`|EECePKs6aa	I was in pre-k and we were coming back to recess and i decided to hide from the teacher.So i hid under a desk and my teacher couldn't find me.So she called the police.Thay searched everywhere for me.I was such a trouble maker.The y even searched by a river for me! :0 Then the police finally found me hiding under the desk.I was in SO much trouble lol :D|`|e3i7FWw9aa	ooohhh....when dah first time i went on an airplane and used the bathroom there, the door wouldn't open and i was struggling to open it up lol and than like 5 airplane assistants or w/e yuh call em came and opened the door. it was hysterical|`|UDu828VEaa	All I can remember is when I was 5 yrs old, we were walking to the mall, and both of my parents were holding onto my hands.|`|SLSX6QQsaa	Hmmm I can remember so many.  The earliest memory I can think of is really nothing exciting, but anyways here it goes...I was 1 year old, and I spent a lot of time at my Grandparents house because they babysat me all day.  My Aunt (who is 45 now) was only 18 at the time.  She carried me upstairs to her room because she had bought me a new red dress with white polka dots on it.  She dressed me up in it, brushed my hair, then carried me back downstairs to show my Grandparents who were maybe 50 at the time.  They are going on 80 pretty soon.  Crazzyy that I can remember this, in detail.  I can picture exactly how they looked back then like it was yesterday.  I also remember them buying me my first pair of Nike tennis shoes, and I didn't realize how young I was until I found this pair of shoes in my keepsake chest and they were a size 3, baby size.  This is for a 1 year old, and again I can remember them putting these shoes on me like it was yesterday.|`|DXN8sK0maa	uhmmm i remeber when i was 4 i was at the mall and i thouqht my aunt was next to me and i look to my right and at tht same second i see this head fallinq off it tirns out it was a skeleton cause it was around halloween my aunt was to my left not right i remebered how badly i screamed lmaoOo|`|IDC7BijGaa	My fifth birthday.

wpmRxih8aa	Honestly, trying to have a low budget wedding for 100-200 is practically impossible. I do not know how much things cost in your area but for me, in Maryland, my family and I are planning a 100 person wedding and are already up to 28,000! Originally my budget was 15,000. I know it sounds expensive, and it is, but its really hard to budget for a wedding your size. Unless you do a lot of DIY ( Which we didnt have time for, my moms a DR and I live in England) and do your own food, your wedding is bound to get up there. Catering alone for 100 people can be up to 75/head!  If i had the time, I would have made my own cake ( mine cost $795) and done the flowers myself. I recommend you doing that. That would have saved me 4,000!<br>  <br>  I hope you are able to work something out. Good Luck!|`|giocJLVKaa	Honestly, I think this depends on what you consider to be low budget, along with what type of wedding/reception you want.  Is it going to be a formal affair or casual?  Do you want a sit down meal or a buffet or just a desert reception?  Are you having a big bridal party, expensive dress, lots of added decorations and flowers that add up quickly?<br>  <br>  Personally I couldn't imagine having a low budget wedding for 100-2000 people.  To me that's a lot of people and low budget in my mind is in the lower thousands and less.<br>  <br>  I'm not completely done paying for everything yet, but I am pretty sure with everything I have so far, plus the estimates on what I still want/need I won't be spending more than $800.  (We are having 30-45 people, and my dress was the most expensive individual thing at $300)|`|YzhZCs3Naa	I'm managing an under $10K wedding in Key West with a beach ceremony and Hard Rock reception with 50-75 guests...if I can do that, you definitely can do something for under $5k. <br>  <br>  I noticed Overstock.com has great deals on dresses and tux. Also houseofbrides.com<br>  <br>  good luck!!|`|wyNVJXUiaa	I had a low budget wedding - entire wedding (including rehearsal dinner) was about 6K.  But I bet people can do it even cheaper.|`|aipChC3haa	With yours...I would say you could get something nice for right around $8,000 if you push yourself =)|`|db480b0326aa746e21c31b97cb752aacaa	about $5,000 to $20,000|`|4lL34wJnaa	That all depends on your area and how many people you want to invite.  A small wedding will definitely cost less than a large one.<br>  <br>  I'm having 200 guests at my wedding in Connecticut (notoriously one of the most expensive states in the USA).  We're getting a steal at about $24,000 compared to our friends who have gotten married in the area.|`|zNjACkxpaa	if its a small wedding <$1000. You really need to give more details for an exact answer<br>  <br>  Location: NYC & LA will cost more than  Kansas or Montana<br>  Guests: 10 ? 200?<br>  Season?<br>  Day of the week: Sunday and Friday are cheaper than Saturday.<br>  Formality: Casual is cheaper than Gown & tux|`|LAXbJfvwaa	Economical - for 200 people?  Wow - since the number of people makes a huge difference to the cost of a wedding I would suggest an economical wedding would be 100 people or less.  Though it really depends on each person's idea of what 'economical' means.  I believe ours was reasonably economical (we had 80 guests) and it still cost us $15,000 AUD (about $10000 US).  People can still have nice weddings for less - but at this price we got most of what we wanted.  (We did scimp on transport by renting 2 of the same car - instead of having a fancy chauffered one, and the cake we made ourselves - a family effort.  And we also got a photographer for really cheap - just by luck really - but he was still very good)|`|jPJ9MTCwaa	You really could do something for $1000 or less if you are really thrifty.  Get a simple dress, guys wear suits instead of a tux, have it at home or the home of a friend that is nice, maybe even have it at a free venue or cheap like a lovely park or public location, do heavy appetizers or just punch and cake for the reception, only have one person stand for each the bride and groom, minimal flowers and decorations, etc.  Also look into trading services (know someone who has some sound equipment who wants...I don't know, their bathroom painted?  A friend who is good with a camera?  Anyone great at baking?)  The more you do yourself, the cheaper it is.|`|cQDEjeZ7aa	Im having a smallish wedding around 60-70 people, its not really fancy by no means. And so far we have spent $2,000. And we have to spend about $600 to finish it. Weddings are sooo expensive its crazy. Were just having ours in a church, in Indiana.|`|aLJdfbd3aa	How low can you go?

Q4D5T5vwaa	i don't have a father anymore either. you're not the only one. i don't even call mine dad anymore. i haven't even talked to him for 4 years now. i'm better off w/o him in my life. he's a ****.|`|bdSm8Mi6aa	Yeah i had problems with my parents.  I know this is totally lame of me to say but rather than thinking you are better off without him maybe you should work at having a better relationship w/ him.  Maybe you should approach his yelling in a more mature manner than being a smart *ss.  Rather than just talking back just say things in a calm manner like "gee dad im sorry you feel that way ill work harder next time"  the thing that's funny about this is that it still pisses parents off but they can't really say anything in response to that. I used that on my mom and dad back in my day & it pissed them off so much because they were just ready to argue.  Just keep telling him he's right, & eventually he'll just be quiet.  In all honesty tho, was the cat supposed to be your responsibility. be honest w/ yourself & decide whether or not he's right about a few things.  He just wants the best for you.|`|cK2xjyFyaa	i know exactly how you feel, my dad is constantly yelling at me we get into an agrument atleast everyday cuz hes stupid and yells at me for the smallest things ever!

He is very mean in the sense he never does anything nice for me, he has cheated on my mom since they got married and hes just not someone i like!|`|OiBuu8eVaa	I can only say think of how you would feel if you had no dad.

kRbkiPvnaa	I don't know the complete situation, It is abuse, but how disrespectful was the 15 year old? was she being violent towards her parents?  There are times to "spank" or punish a misbehaving child as long as it doesn't cross the legal boundaries. If a parent is angry enough to "punch" a child in the face they are in no shape to be administering any type of punishment.  Punishment should only be dealt with a calm and clear mind and with explanation to the child as to why they are being punished.  Abuse is done in anger, Punishment should be done with love.|`|E7TkNO00aa	That is 1000% child abuse. There is no reasonon this earth why that father should hit his daughter that way. If he would've yelled at her, it still doesn't make it right, but the way he hit her. He is one sick man and deserves to be in jail. I hope that girl is not you.|`|7a9ca1e0d676415430d900245a7c2d25aa	That would be considered physical abuse because punishment, by law, cannot leave a mark lasting more than 15 minutes. A nose bleed or torn up mouth would last much longer. Also, punching is not a form of discipline according to childrens services.|`|1elv7oc5aa	That is, without a doubt, physical child abuse.  And btw physical punishment is against the law.  It is called corporal punishment and it's illegal.  If this has happened to you then tell someone and go live with a different family member.  If this is truly just a paper then good luck.|`|OmHeUwhnaa	That's child abuse, parents shouldn't be punching their child.|`|3iUE9lGVaa	child abuse|`|OL3MUunlaa	First off spanking a child or corporal punishment is NOT against the law, however child abuse is, and what  you describe is abuse.  No parent should ever under any circumstances punch a child.  Should she be punished for being disrespectful to her dad, absolutely, but not abused.  If what you say is true, than chances are this isn't the first time he has abused her.  No parent wakes up one day and suddenly becomes abusive.  He should be reported to child services|`|Y6lAx4dUaa	I would definitely classify this incident as abuse. Here are some of my thoughts - please feel free to use them if they help with your paper:<br>  <br>  ~ the father appears to have made no attempt to address the situation in a non-violent, non-physical manner. She talked back, he punched her. This is not a calculated punishment - it is a reaction, likely out of anger.<br>  ~ a 15 year old can be reasoned with. At that age, children are fully capable of understanding actions and consequences.<br>  ~ the act of punching someone in the nose is not an act of discipline. It is an act of violence. The father could not have known for certain if it would break the daughter's nose or cause serious and/or permanent damage. He didn't even stop to consider it.<br>  ~ punching is not an appropriate or acceptable form of punishment. It is assault and there is no excuse.<br>  ~ the father did not teach his daughter anything that she needed to learn (which is the intention behind discipline). She behaved disrespectfully and he reacted by treating her even more disrespectfully.<br>  ~ it is unacceptable for a man to punch a woman in any civilized society. The daughter has a legal right to press assault charges against any man (or woman) who would treat her this way and her father is no exception.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps you. Good luck with your paper.

Yes, I'm a woman and I'm supposed to stick with the sistahood and represent, but she's being a "c" word.<br>  <br>  That should give you some comfort, knowing that you're not with her anymore, and she's HIS problem now. They deserve each other.<br>  <br>  There's no point to any of this, and engaging them in any way, like saying hello, arguing, pleading, asking them to not come around ... all of that dialogue will only serve their purpose, which is to mess with you.<br>  <br>  You didn't mention what you do for a living or what kind of environment you work in, but what I would do is just refuse to interact with them in any way, shape or form. Don't acknowledge their presence.<br>  <br>  It can be done. I once worked an entire Saturday shift from 8am - 4pm with me and a co-worker in the same room and we only spoke when it was for a work related issue. She was also being a "c", and I was having none of it. The more she harrangued me, the more determined I was to not say a word or even look at her. It actually became fun towards the end, because she kept saying, "ok come on ... you don't seriously mean to not say a word, do you?" Uhh ... yea, I did :D<br>  <br>  Anyway, you don't have to be friends with them. You do need to interact with her sometimes regarding the kids, but that's as far as it needs to go. If she decides to marry this guy, things will change, but for now ... just get on with life.<br>  <br>  *big hug*|`|mtOVRAnbaa	NOO I dont think you should have to be friends with him at all..

Otherwise there really is no reason for the Ex to come floating around. If they do just ignore her and him. Try the IFP(iron fist policy) on her. Do not communicate at all with her, no emails, phone calls, or letters. She can call ur kids on the cell phone. There is no need for you to even speak with her. Your parenting time is just that, your parenting time. And hers is hers. Next....|`|9BEPU2nNaa	restraining order is needed.|`|PREcj1STaa	Oh My God I know how you feel  My best friend of 5 years got with my Ex- Husband not even a year after we split. I did not want my kids around her much less at her house . what was worse is that i had to go to court and we agreed she was the middle person because i had a protective order . It was hard but now  almost two years later we are the best of friends once again so remember We cant help who we fall in love with and she was not the one for you so stop hurting over someone who's not hurting for you .. and start living again!!|`|lg6jexk7aa	It is best for the kids if there isn't any visual animosity between you and your ex and her new boyfriend - but that doesn't mean you have to be friends, you only have to be amicable.<br>  <br>  Why is the ex-wife continually showing up to your work for anyway?<br>  <br>  The boyfriends and ex are obviously construing the fact that because you don't want them there, then you are jealous (its how they justify and revoke all their responsibility to leave you alone).<br>  <br>  Maybe if they are there for the kids, have a strict plan and agreement in place that is less disruptive for your working environment?|`|qPDnxTE0aa	You don't have to be friends with them, but you do have to be civil to them for the children's sake.<br>  <br>  It is beyond rude that she keeps wanting to come around you and even ruder that it is with him in tow!<br>  I personally think she wants to make you angry enough (or jealous enough) to have you do something that would jeopardize keeping full custody of your children. Or she just gets off on getting you upset, because it makes her feel like you still want her.<br>  <br>  Please talk to your local police department and see if you can get some type of restraining order against them.|`|vSWDNaDwaa	I agree with both of the above answers that you need to be civil and you might need a restraining order.<br>  <br>  Explain to your ex that you are giving her another chance to stay away from your place of employment, with the consequences of a restraining order that she stay away from your place of employment. (You might want to tell your boss too.)<br>  <br>  If she comes around again, pay the money and get a restraining order. You can get one that just specifies your place of employment. That way, she can not say that you do not want her to see the children.<br>  <br>  You can choose about being friends with her new man. The same can go for him. He can wait in the car on the street at your house while momma comes for the kids. He can stay away from your place of employment or face a restraining order too.<br>  <br>  People will treat you however you let them treat you. Be firm and calm. If you want to ensure the message is delivered calmly, write it out in a letter. You and read it to them and give it to them, which I recommend. That way they can hear your calm tone of voice. Alternatively, mail it to your ex and wait for the phone to ring.<br>  <br>  Good luck,<br>  <br>  Zule, the old guy
6sJhoXAAaa	You have to go out with other people. Don't have sex with any of them unless you really do have feelings for them. Just have fun and dates until you find the right person.|`|u18SzgJwaa	mia is no fun.  have sex with someone you want to have sex with.  there are no rules, just do it.|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	Of COURSE you still want him-he was the only one you ever had. By now, I'm sure he is onto the 4th girl. Move on!|`|oOVAbKPmaa	You yelled at him at his first attempt and told him you'd never give in and now you expect him to make the first move? C'mon, get real. Besides, it seems to me he already made the first move and you rejected him. Your mistake, darlin', and now you lose...|`|2ef2c0e844e19038f6a979bb78073d8daa	Way too much drama.|`|GfzaszPPaa	well then ya could both have sex if ya want and not have a public relationship lol|`|J7Mmo5Xmaa	Well first you have sex and did it to "get it over with" then you keep trying to control him and for the nail in your coffin, you are forcing him to just be "platonic friends".As soon as some hot chick showers him with love and attention, your history, your toast.<br>  Next it is better to get to know someone FIRST before having sex duh huh.<br>  Why?<br>  Let's say you had gotten pregnant then found out he has no intention of ever committing to you or any woman then what?Or he continues to do things "you don't like" and refuses to stop doing those things "you don't like"?<br>  It is good that you want to take time to get to know him better,but you need to tell him that you made a mistake having sex too soon, and although you enjoyed it you are glad you are not pregnant because you want to get to know one another better and see if friendship and compatibility exist,because if it doesn't then the relationship won't last.He will understand that,instead of you acting cold towards him and being controlling, he sees THAT as you being a cold hearted b-tch hon.Not trying to be mean, that is exactly how you are coming across to him.Last, sex after one month is foolish because you do not  know one another well at all,otherwise you would not be guessing at what he is thinking and feeling.|`|mLtZPECaaa	I think you should tell him how you feel because somebody else might make that move before you do so you should go get it off your chest.I bet he is stressing over that you keep sayin were juss friends.He probably trying to see if you still like him.Please get it off your chest!!! hope this help :] -kimmy-|`|jcqa41rcaa	Stay away from your ex. Do not have sex with him. Missing him and missing his penis is natural. That's why breakups suck. Have sex with other people and you'll get over him!|`|rh8szekzaa	The best way to get over someone is to get under someone else. As they say.|`|Ah9nRiidaa	There has to be a big reason that you broke off the relationship regardless you are going to miss him everyone goes through it especially with there first just take it really easy and slow but keep your options open so you can get to know other people to because you aren't going to be intimate with someone unless you let yourself get over him. Over time if you still see him as more then a friend and you still are missing him and he's the same way for you then I would talk about it but don't rush back into the relationship because that will just make things so much more worse.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|if140waXaa	It doesn't sound like a healthy relationship, nor does it sound like one that will eventually change for the better especially since it's sex with an ex. The best thing to do is date other people to get your mind off this person and spend more time with friends and family. It is hard, hard, hard-but it isn't impossible. But you have to train yourself. You are worth more than just a booty call sex relationship. It may be a while before you get over but this sounds like a false attachment. Don't mistake sex for love and allow someone to use you. You will end up hurting yourself over and over again. Most guys like this that see your state of mind keep you on a string. But it is up to you how long you allow it to happen. Try your best to move on. The good sex can be very deceiving. It's going to be hard, but you can do it. You have to be very strong. Think about the bad things about this person that turn you off because there has to be some & think about them constantly!!<br>  <br>  These relationships are the hardest to get over and overcome. But eventually you will get tired and move on and realize that you deserve better. Don't have sex with other people. You may feel confused and you shouldn't ever give yourself to anyone to get over someone else. It will never work. Do no contact with this person. I doubt they care about your best interest.|`|xCjUEiB3aa	Honestly i would say if you really like him try to see what happens and ask him if he does like you...if he put up the whole "<3" and im out of it thing come on the guy likes you still who else would he be thinking about the whole day before you guys went hiking. If you miss him for sex dont get back with him cuz thats just to much but if you DO like him TRULY then try 2 c if you both can work things out cuz it seems to me that both of you still have feelings for one another and CAN work things out slowly!<br>  GOodluckkk!!! :)|`|yRIYBX4iaa	It's not worth it and you know it.  If you thought it was worth getting involved, you wouldn't be asking complete strangers.  I think you're trying to get reassurance even though you know you shouldn't. You're better than this and you can find someone even more terrific.  Its a big ocean out there, start fishing!|`|xG7sujZyaa	find someone BIGGER AND BETTER than him and you will find hes not so great :P|`|2wndt5MSaa	When you had sex with him, it shouldnt have been "just to get it over with". That's not what sex is about. If he wants you to be his booty call, then you probably shouldn't be having sex with him. He sounds like a bit of a player, but i wouldn't know for sure. As for missing the sex, its pretty normal but you can easily get rid of that feeling (Google it). Maybe you should start dating other guys and see where that takes you.|`|iFNkZiv4aa	I agree with MIA up there except for the last part. In my opinion you aren't ready to have sex or be in a relationship some time soon. You should learn to appreciate yourself first before you let other people in. Sex is sex darling but sex with someone you truly know and love and who understands you...now that's Fantastic sex.|`|iTYOkRUNaa	You don't reveal your age, so I will have to guess.  Intimacy is the most important aspect, anyone of opposite sex can have sex.   Pleasing intimacy is hard to continually find in todays world.  Intimacy is what you are seeming to be looking for from your query.  Don't depend on sex  to provide intimacy!

MZbQ5MPdaa	He is a cousin. Either they made a mistake or someone in the family has been married that you don't know anything about. See who has been married to whom and you'll figure it out.

MbHwygxbaa	Haha sounds farmilar,<br>  <br>  you just have to be normal to him, dont act all obsessed, just be friends with him, and your friends telling him your not obsessed will just make him think your more obsessed, just be friendly to him it will work out in the end|`|2SxIkm7Xaa	Okay the one mistake us girls make when it comes to a guy we really like. First off, you're only in the 7th grade hun! You have high school coming to deal with, other guys there too. <br>  <br>  You can't get a guy to want to like you. It comes naturally, if he doesn't like you back, hey have to let go and move on. The problem is, when we want a guy we like so badly, it actually shows to everyone. Even if we think we are trying to keep our cool about it. Then, it starts to weird that special guy out. Therefore causing not to want to speak to the one crushing. This recently happened to one of my friends. <br>  <br>  You also have to be careful what you tell your friends as your friends should not be going around saying you are obsessed with him. That is not right and supposed to be respecting you in that manner.  Or who ever they are talking to about it is doing that. <br>  <br>  It will eventually turn into a he said she said game, kind of like playing the old game telephone, you know when you start off saying one thing, it never is spoken right by the last person. <br>  <br>  So, I would only confide in a friend of yours you can trust to be able to share your thoughts. If you find you are not sure who, then best to just keep to yourself on the subject. <br>  <br>  <br>  I know it's hard, but no one can really force anyone to like whom ever. <br>  Take some distance from him for awhile. Then when you see him after all this dies down, say hello how is your day? If he responds, build from there. If he still gives you the cold shoulder, forget about him!!! He will not be worth draining your mind out emotionally. <br>  <br>  I know this is not the answer you  wanted, but it's the honest truth~ <br>  Best of luck!<br>  <br>  Hope I Helped.|`|N39uQiZMaa	Boys like him aren't really that much on boy-girl relationship. I really can't help you make him like you, nor can i give you a love potion, but i can advise some few tips for you to be close to him, as in to be "friends". Sorry, this is all i can do.<br>  <br>  First, pretend you don't like him anymore. Try to spread a rumor that you have a boyfriend outside the school to counter the rumor that you're obsessed to him. Second, after a week or two, talk to him in a plain, friendly manner, the way how you talk with other guys that you consider friends. He may not want to talk to you at first, but just keep talking to him day after day after day. Be sure not to over do this, after talking to him, talk to other guys as well. After some time, if you're successful, may be you two will be friends. Try to watch the series and movies he likes and talk about it together. Well, if you've been successful up to this point, he maybe able to like you, or in the process, he may confess that he truly loves you too, but he just concealed it this past days because it may destroy his reputation or studies. Well, this is all i can say. God bless with him! c",)|`|c9Nvdujmaa	First of all you gotta stop the rumors! You gotta show him your not obsessed even tho you really arent... Plus if he wont go to you to tlk to you/... u gotta make the first move... clear the rumors and if a guy really cared about you he wouldnt care about any rumors... maybe he isnt worth your time if he doesnt wanna tlk to you. and to make him like you if u really like him... maybe you gotta stop liking him for a while and later when all the rumors clear.. then talk to him and be his friend get to know him and then maybe he'll be interested in the real you. and if it works move on to someone else who is worth your time :)|`|ivejg4whaa	The problem with this is: you can't force anyone to like you or feel something that they don't. If he heard that you had a crush on him and he felt the same he would have asked you out by now.<br>  Move on.<br>  The world is a harsh place, I'm not trying to be mean but you have to take things as they are instead of what you wish they were. Make sense?|`|Q64yv0POaa	you cant make somebody like you you have to play hard to get just leave him alone for a while and when he sees you flirting with other guys he will come back and be like begging at your feet(not really) but something like that iam in the 9th grade and have the same problem but i have learned to stay away and jst leave him alone and i just dont care what ppl say <br>  <br>  hope you try this good luck gurlie
F54wr11Caa	wear on of those cool old faded blue jeans and a cool top. Don't wear anything fancy. I say a cool shirt with a logo or something and a jacket. It is casual but not too casual. have Fun|`|jYTfJESFaa	Well, everytime I go skating, I wear black jeans and a black jacket. it goes good with white skates :D|`|nEWIAN29aa	Wear something that matches!

SrP7eIgsaa	How old are you? How old is she? My best advice...coming from a girl who is with "the guy that was in love with me while I was with someone else", is get to be her good friend...but genuinely...not with your alterior motives driving you. Be her shoulder to cry on. Try to have that "moment when you look in her eye." Then the second she's free....ask her out to dinner...to "talk" or "talk about it." Move in subtly with class. BAM you got her.|`|fw7sE7oaaa	yeah all's fair in love and war. if worse comes to worse just try to be a really good friend to her and just sorta be there for her|`|5nmvSXr4aa	Fear is dumb, just go for it!
O9VN7SGiaa	TOO LONG!!!|`|LrVzkhl4aa	Ok, 3 way calling your crush and your friend asking this guy personal questions and you giggling over the phone is a whole big reason why he would say he doesnt want a girlfriend. He asked if he'd have to pay because of how your friend called and asked if hed go out with you cuz you both sound desperate and it made it sound like you were looking for sex, as a simple solution (a.k.a- a whore)<br>  Give the guy time, hes probably creeped out and if you jump all over him the next time you see him he'll just be wierded out. When you do talk to him, flirt a little here and there but still dont go crazy! =) and give it time. Since he does have your number, and figured out any hints dropped, there is still a chance you can be friends with him.. dont force anything|`|DLND3rokaa	first, he probably said do i have to pay as a joke. dont get mad but like prostitute way. and then he probably said no, he doesnt have a girlfriend.  i think he would date you|`|Y6YaMR34aa	he means will she pay him to go out with her best friend. But he doesnt know its you so he proabbly wouldnt pay 2 go out with you.|`|aOYkqGOxaa	Loooooong is rite, gal back off for awhile and just watch, be elusive|`|iGZWeWwBaa	? Way too long! But...:<br>  <br>  When he said no, it means he doesn't have a girlfriend. And since he knows it's a 3 way call, he was unsure of what to say incase it was someone he didn't want to be listening. <br>  <br>  P.S. How do you have a 3 way call?|`|FOyNZfeBaa	I can Tell he likes You so just talk to him

03GQ637Raa	Leave the situation alone, he sounds like he's gonna do what he wants to do and there's nothing you or anyone else can.|`|3iNobwVraa	Yeah, that does sound kind of scary.  If I had reason to believe someone was serious about this, (seriously sounds like joking to me) I would:<br>  <br>  *Get very still and hold very direct eye contact*  "I think you have VERY serious problems.  Comments like that reveal your character and it looks pretty hideous."  *step closer, lower voice, and speak slowly, "I am going to find ________ and tell her you said that.  And, next time I hear you're becoming friends with a girl, I'm going to tell her too.  The only way you can stop me is by seeking immediate counseling--twice a week.  I don't want to think this of you, but if you force me to by continuing to act like such a prick, I will; and my actions will follow therefrom."  <br>  <br>  It may not sound very threatening, but I have a very intimidating delivery when I want to.  I'm VERY comfortable in that hat even though I usually choose not to wear it.  Yeah, your friend is sick.  How sad.  And, how pathetic, because this behavior is a thinly veiled attempt to disguise MAJOR weakness.  It's FAR harder to be a good person, believe me!!!  (In fact, I might say that too, because that would hit him right where it would really resonate.)<br>  <br>  All that being said, however, I'm a girl, so it is highly unlikely anyone would ever say this to me.  So, what did you say?  It's pretty inconvenient to have to stand up to a friend, and against such horrid behavior, but please remember: principles only mean something if you stand up for them when they are inconvenient.  (not mine, d/k who said it but I've always remembered it.)|`|pAwa23hEaa	NO! NO! NO!

Of all people who can put this guy's head on the right way it you, his friend. I think we all know how seriously wrong that is.

8FWcCdfkaa	Oh. my. GOD. i hate people like this. You know what you need to do, just speak your mind, tell them how annoying and immature and stupid they are. hey, honesty always works, lol. These are just the type of brats that like to pick on people cuz it makes them feel better about themselves and their ego. I dont know why but it brings them 'happiness' to them somehow. if they still wont shutup just do the mature thing and ignore them even if it kills you. Be nice to them. That gets on their nerves so bad! because they can't get the sastisfaction they get when thay get on YOUR nerves. I've done it & itreally works. My history teach told me that. He is the coolest wisest man i've ever met. Even after all that they still chose to be immature well that's just their problem and you don't have to let it concern you at all. What matters at the end of the day is what YOU think of yourself, not what others think of you. What they think can't change who you are.

GYoNyoWtaa	Defintely could be a red flag!<br>  Most fathers that wanted to be in marriage, would work things out...the fact that he isn't willing to do anything expecially even correct your brother and you...show's me that he feels as if it isn't worth it|`|KmC0K59taa	How long does he stay away?  What is your mom doing when he leaves?<br>  <br>  If someone leaves every night maybe they have a drinking problem or a gambling problem.  Your dad just might use you and your brother fighting as an excuse to leave.|`|vSWDNaDwaa	Dad is escaping something. It could be the fighting or something else. It may be an indication that he wants to end his marriage (divorce) or something else.<br>  <br>  Brothers fighting do not cause divorce. Your parents relationship may be having problems. You can possibly help by behaving and helping out around the house. If there are less problems at home, maybe your parents can resolve what ever is causing dad to take off in the evenings.<br>  <br>  It is probably a good time to have a family meeting to discuss your observations and concerns. If not that, maybe try talking to your father alone and tell him you are concerned because of what you are seeing.<br>  <br>  Sincerely,<br>  Zule, the old guy|`|lg6jexk7aa	well if he is just getting away for a while - just to have some peace and quiet, it doesn't mean divorce.<br>  <br>  But if your parents are having major problems in their marriage then it is a good sign that divorce maybe on the cards (especially if they can't or won't work through their problems)|`|v2a220YWaa	Your dad taking off has nothing to do with you or your brother, I dont know if it will lead to divorce, or if he is having an affair, but either way dont blame yourself, it is NOT your fault!!!|`|V5JJK8Okaa	not divorce . maybe he just need some time to refresh.<br>  its not that kinda deep problem to make a move for a divorce|`|Hz94L5b5aa	Not exactly. Your Dad could be leaving to escape from home for a break (but it sounds like that is a little overboard). He could also be leaving for some "cool-off" time. Whether he does it for you, or himself, he might know that it is better for him to leave than to do or say something drastic that he may not mean.
7A30yQf4aa	I myself go through similar things with my sister. I no longer live at home though but I will say I DO NOT agree with Revenge. Your sister needs help. She is most likely mentally ill. Try to be the bigger person. Do not feed into her ways. She is expecting you to react to her. Do not give her that satisfaction. Where are your parents when she is doing this. Your parents need to step up and work to control her.|`|UOj60V3uaa	your sister might be all of the things you say she is but revenge isn't the way to go. You should be more mature. Get a lock for your door for starters so that you only have a key, dont let her borrow anything from you because you already know what will end up happening. It isn't all her fault if you just do nothing to prevent it.|`|67841ed5a773f905fb355783ad71eceaaa	OK, sounds like your sister has some serious, serious, mental health issues. She needs help, but it doesn't seem like she would accept it.<br>  On the other hand, that's not really your problem. Have you tried telling your parents what has been going on? Do you think they might give you permission to lock your bedroom door while you're gone? This might stop her from taking or breaking your things.<br>  Forget the revenge thing, just try looking into the future and coming up with ways to stop her from doing more damage. And please do try to tell your parents what is happening. They might not believe it, but you can try.|`|8WGxXA5vaa	O.k your first mistake is trusting her time and time again. Lending her money, listening to her problems an being way too nice to her. Stop all of the above, get a lock for your bedroom and put all your valuables in there when your not home and lock it. Are you old enough to move out?? If not then you have to tell your parents about  her behaviour?<br>  <br>  Idon't know how your parents allow her to get away with all this stuff  she claims she is so sick then how does she have time for boys and smoking pot, your folks need to kick her out otherwise she will never change. I can understand your frustration if that was me in your position I would have kicked her Azz a long time ago.<br>  <br>  I don't condone revenge but she really needs a good kick up the bum.<br>  <br>  Why don't you take something of hers that you know means a lot to her and then destroy it and then return to her room without her being there and say you know nothing about it. Put itching powder on her bed and in all her clothes and start taking random things from her and giving it to charity, not only will it make you feel good by doing something good but also cos she won't get it back.
8c7f32d052d097a7718edc9c6a056b56aa	maybe you are suffering from depression. Have you ever tried talking to someone professionally? Perhaps you have had a traumatic experience in your life and you still suffer from the affects of it. I know that I feel this way sometimes, but ever since I've been taking anti-depressants I feel a lot better.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|uFiJaR7vaa	listen to music. go to a museum. read poetry. if you cant understand those pursuits, google it.|`|krRCVZL4aa	you is dead, man<br>  LIKE EDWARD!!!<br>  YUMM|`|BGIxDWkZaa	Seek professional help. There will surely be a first call for help in your county or city. You will start therapy and this is all private. There maybe be some medications involved. Don't know your age, but even if you have to have a parent sign for you, your personal details cannot be released to them. Unless you want it. Give it a try. It can't hurt, and might just help|`|pBD1thilaa	Try to take it easy and spend time with friends. Try to have a good time and laugh, and possibly just spend some quality time with family or a girl|`|34EBzIL6aa	first you breathe. then, make a list of all of the things that you're grateful for.  commit a random act of kindness|`|QAmgy7oXaa	see a doctor|`|851bf075860be83c579bd47dd0a07b55aa	Well first just let me say this, the ones that said something about you being dead and idiots don't bother listening to them.<br>  <br>  As for your issue, relax, take a deep breath, take a step back(not literally) close you eyes and think of something happy something that makes you feel warm inside, you are all right, you are not nothing, do something you enjoy, hang out with a friend, watch you favorite movie, listen to your favorite music. Take a few minutes to relax once you've done that see if you still feel cold inside, if so talk to someone.|`|twX2QeUIaa	Dude...your dead...your a ghost right now.
mcpu4ZDtaa	Yes you can make friends anywhere but you have no assurance if they can be real and true friends. It is important if you'll choose your friends, it's for your own good. However, you can't easily say if that person is a good influence to you or not. So I would recommend Web detective site to you where you can investigate your friends or associates online. Yes! you heard me right dear. I've tried this before, and I found out that one of my associate is a registered sex offender. So from that day I don't hang with him often especially alone.<br>  <br>  Here's the link by the way: www.web-detective.com/index1.aspx<br>  <br>  Good luck for finding a new friend. :)|`|zhsTxqGxaa	Don't make friends on here.  Make friends in life.  You do this by joining clubs or talking to people at school.  You have to go out of the house and start conversing with people.  That's a start.|`|L0LUGdc3aa	Don't make friends off the internet. Like the answerer above me said, start conversing with other people that share your interests!|`|6xXAMwxBaa	i had the same problem in college. 13 prescriptions of penicillin later and i'm the most popular person on campus!!

Ublc3bAtaa	heres another fact. most black men with hugh knobs are also gay, truth they take it up the shiter.. eeeeeeewwwwwwww......|`|cHM2US6xaa	Haha I wouldn't know,<br>  <br>  I like my men white..<br>  <br>  But from what my gross friends have told me, they believe its true.<br>  <br>  And i'm not sure what to believe. No i'm guessing ?|`|f1Unp3fBaa	I'm black and I'm not hung like a horse. IN fact, many black guys aren't carrying 10 inch schlongs around.|`|eBQ2ulqaaa	Myths concerning males<br>  <br>  Black men have naturally larger penises than white men.<br>  <br>  This couldn't be further from the truth. Based on a number of surveys (most notably Masters and Johnson), of thousands of men of many different races, white males actually have the largest penises. White males averaged an erect penis length of 6.4" while black males averaged 6.2". Hispanic men averaged 6.0" and finally east Asian men bring up the rear with a meager 5.6" (Did you catch that pun?). Erect penis lengths are taken by measuring from the TOP of the penis, where it joins the body, to the tip of the head.<br>  <a href="http://www.sex-project.com/myths.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.sex-project.com/myths.shtml</a>|`|TadINnYoaa	I think that whole thing is repulsive. I like respect and admire the gentle features of a real woman. Not some sack to be ravaged by some mammoth animal like creature drooling on power size pain lust self image and all that horrible weird stuff.<br>  <br>  When people are properly intimate it has nothing to do with porn or any of that rampant supremecy size power hang up.<br>  The sick women involved are as much to blame for the existence of such vile denegration of humanity.<br>  <br>  I know a lot of escort women who dislike and often refuse services to hung like a horse flesh monsters.<br>  <br>  They much prefer an average sized man with manners.|`|mpGjPV6Xaa	To me , that's all bullshiit, they are not the most endowed and the girls that wrote on here don't know much anyway, just agreeing with your question. Black guys in porn use penis pumps, penis pills, penis surgery, etc... same with many white, hispanic, chinese, italian men that you'll see in pornagraphy.<br>  <br>  You see , the black guys you seen with 12, 14. and even 16 inch penish isn't their actual size you know that, right ? They had to get it done like that, to penetrate a woman's vagina better and to achieve better orgasm.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps !!!<br>  <br>  Joseph D : )|`|TJuzo4Lraa	when actually using it, black men's probaby superb but when watching it, you cant see a thing|`|UjXBeIOIaa	i believe this one to be true however size is not everything. besides you cant expect white men to have everything good each race has something to offer that the way i see it. as far as i know its mostly white men that use those "penis enlargement pills" as someone put it.|`|ac4f75077a490d754cf61987eb93cad3aa	Don't know. Don't care to know. Size means nothing and the thought of being stretched out down there is gross.|`|vBcqzMz4aa	Black guys are for when you can't get a white dude.

Don't do that stuff in front of her or near anyone who may know her! Dont tell her of ur dreams of other women! Ur making her feel insecure. How can she even know u love her when u tell her other girls stare u down and u stare back? How can she know u love her when u tell her u want BABIES with other women? Family is security....women need that. A wife needs it from her hubby. And ur go'in n tell'in her u want kids with another woman! If u must look at another woman, just do a quick look. Like outta the corner of ur eye or something...really quick.<br>  <br>  How would u like it if she came home all the time telling u how some hot guy made her wet? How would u like it if she said she dreams of having kids with SOME OTHER GUY than u? For most men who truly love their wives, that would bruise their egos, because men connect sex with confidence.

I think most of us in here are disgusted with your arrogance.  There is nothing wrong with thinking you are hansom, but when you married all that hump anything with a pulse should have went out the window.  I don't think you truly know what love is.  Your poor wife will probably end up getting pregnant thinking that life is wonderful not realizing she married a rutting dog, in sheep's clothing.  You really need to do some soul searching before she gets pregnant and ask yourself is being married what you want.

RvddYKqjaa	Your boyfriend is in the back room and you are running around half dressed in front of your Dad?  At 14 I probably pulled on a robe or housecoat, but I never really ran around anywhere in my underwear. Our family didn't really hide when they were heading to the bathroom or something, but they would cover themselves. I never ran around like that when any guy was at my house. Not even when I was engaged at 22. My Dad would have pretended not to see me, even if he had. I don't think it's a big deal though. You are dressed, sort of.|`|AA11596133	WAY WAY BEFORE THE BRA STAGE - I would say it is never really a good idea to run around in front of an adult male, BUT, my daughters did when they were still in diapers.  After they were potty trained, they no longer wanted to run around naked.<br>  <br>  There is NO excuse for a teenage girl to do this, NOR is it OK for a teenager to have a boyfriend stay at the house for any reason.|`|7511595fc4d3e31538e8df239de8a7c5aa	a bra and panties are not a bathing suit!!!   there are just some things that you shouldn't do when it comes to modisty.  no one should walk around in underware in front of parents or parents in front of older children!!!|`|KSK22vHUaa	My father never saw me in my underwear once I was old enough to need a bra.  Period.  I was like 10?  Maybe?  And he hadn't seen me in my underwear for a couple of years.<br>  <br>  Bras and panties do cover the same area as a bikini, but the situations are different.  Why would someone see you in your underwear?  It's a totally different situation than being in a bikini.|`|1t3Yre2Haa	well frankly n my case i never run in front of my dad on underwear because my mom teach me to show respect to my dad and for myself and the concept of privacy  and decency so you shoul have a serious talk with your girl and explain her that is not appropiate to be around the house in panties and i'm against the idea that bra and panties are same as bathin suit|`|gkThLcf2aa	...what?|`|DIltPHutaa	Of course this is not appropriate.  I can relate, I just ended a 7 year relationship with a man who had custody of his daughter.  Our primary disagreement was the lack of boundaries he had with his daughter, similar to your situation.  I'm a mother of 2 and have my own daughter...although we're close, we respect each others privacy.<br>  <br>  If this is something that bothers you and you've voiced how you feel to your boyfriend and he hasn't changed things---he probably never will.  Or if he does, it'll be because of you, which would leave you wondering about what goes on when you're not there.  Over time, this can cause some serious problems in your relationship|`|R5Amm3Qzaa	once i grew boobs, i stopped =].
Nr4Va5sLaa	1. pray for her<br>  2. just love her, the more love you show the more she'll see you care and she might feel like she's let you down if she goes through with it.<br>  3. don't lose hope, and don't judge her when you talk to her about it. if you tell her that she's trying to make adult choices so she has to be ready for adult consequences and really try to understand why. ask her what she's feeling, and why she thinks she's feeling it. ask her if she really loves him (which she prob. doesn't but it might help her to let her know you guys aren't ganging up on her)<br>  <br>  I hope it all goes well :D i'll be praying for you:D|`|5j5wZum2aa	Tell your sister that people will get the impression she is a slut.

I'm not going to say that my advice is going to help you because I'm not sure myself. This is a tough situation. Maybe she is going through a rebellious preteen stage. I think your parents should tell her something like you have to listen to me until your eighteen, until then I have to guide you into the correct direction. you may not like everything that I tell you but I do it for you. I love you and care for you so I don't want o see you ruin your life at an early age when you have so much in store for you. You should tell your sister that you truly do care for her and that you don't want anything to happen to her because she is your sister. If that doesn't work maybe family counseling or just counseling for her. Just so the person can try to stop her from messing up her life. I really don't know what to do in this situation.  I hope things get better though and I hope you guys are able to fix the problem. Good luck!|`|OiBuu8eVaa	It's hard, but as you know teenagers will be teens, and have a mind of thier own.

I have three sisters who are younger than me and I have been through a lot trying to keep them from messing up royally, but sometimes they just will not listen no matter how much you plead and beg. You just have to let them do their thing, and then when they see the big mistake they have made, they tell you, I should have listened. There is not much else you can do.
GYoNyoWtaa	The simple answer is because they hurt. They have pain related to loneliness, the rejection and betrayal of a cheating spouse, an unexciting and unsatisfactory relationship, or feeling poorly about themselves.<br>  <br>  Why do women cheat? Because of emotional needs not met and the hurt that accompanies this lack. Is it sometimes just physical lust? Occasionally, but I do not see much of this.<br>  <br>  Loneliness is one of the primary reasons that women seek out affairs or are susceptible to advances. Women who are in an unsatisfactory relationship may feel even lonelier than if they were still single. A partner who is over involved with his work or hobby may severely limit the attention and admiration he gives to his mate.<br>  <br>  She then feels unattractive, uncared for, and hopeless about getting her needs met. While this is a reason for working harder on the relationship, not seeking relief from another man, it is easy to understand the pain that makes the whole thing possible.<br>  <br>  And then there is Revenge. I am seeing much more of this as a motive in recent years. Today's woman is not willing to just sit still and "take it." Unfortunately, the "eye for an eye" approach has become more acceptable and a woman who feels betrayed and rejected may well return the favor.<br>  <br>  Sometimes a woman needs only to hold a suspicion that her partner is cheating to be susceptible. She may have painful memories from other, earlier relationships in her life, and she may have an expectation of being hurt in this one, as well. This is where a "self fulfilling prophecy" can take over and create pain for everyone.<br>  <br>  One reason for a woman's affair is similar to one for men: boredom. An unsatisfying, dull, and predictable relationship that is not growing in depth can make the excitement of a new relationship very attractive.<br>  <br>  The affair is not only exciting due to the new person involved, but also to the whole experience of sneaking around and hiding it. This can be a huge adrenaline rush. It's not saying it too strongly to say that it can even be mildly addictive. Women who have multiple affairs may be experiencing this kind of stimulus.<br>  <br>  Underlying all these reasons for cheating is a poor sense of self-esteem. We all need an adequate amount of affection and admiration from our partners. One way or another this attention falters at times and the person can become insecure and start looking for the attention is other places.<br>  <br>  Women can especially have this problem since our culture puts so much emphasis on physical beauty, sex appeal, and the ability to attract men. The truly secure woman knows that her value rests not in these attributes but in her depth of character, her spiritual self, and in her self-reliance.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, there is very little in our culture to encourage this self awareness and many women unconsciously find their worth in the attention they receive from the men in their lives. And, when it is not coming from their partner they are susceptible to receiving it from other men.<br>  <br>  Few would say that any of these reasons for cheating are justifiable. Whether it is boredom, self-esteem, revenge, or the pain that relationships often bring, the answer is to go to work on the relationship, not to have an affair. We can understand the motivations for affairs, but we still know that they are harmful and someone usually gets hurt badly.|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	They get bored, they weren't as involved as you were, they meet someone else they get excited about, they just lose interest which means there wasn't much there in the first place.|`|wlgRsZpfaa	u get bored, i guess...|`|fMEypXDYaa	For the same reason that men cheat on the women they love, wanting to see what was on the the other side of the fence.|`|9HtT0RiGaa	Sweetie Pie's answer applies to both gender.

Well, for a variety of reasons.  Here are some of the reasons I have come up with.<br>  <br>  1.Today, from grade school to even within many churches, Gods word and expectations of us are not followed or given any real consideration.  They are for the most part made fun of or cast off as olden day nonsense.<br>  2.People are selfish.  They want what they want, when they want it.  They can come up with any number of justifications for what they do or fail to do and can manage to convince themselves they are still good people.<br>  3.People can always find others to back them up or to help absolve them of things.  From friend to family to whom ever, one can usually find a number of people who will help the wrong doer feel less wrong or even good in what they do.<br>  4.People believe that morals are all a matter of what they like or agree with or are comfortable with.  They no longer care or worry about what God said is right or wrong.  They will try to convince themselves that God just wants them to be happy, thereby they think they can be absolves of whatever.<br>  5.Society in general has few if any real morals anymore.  So it is not hard to find many doing worse then you do, so you end up still feeling you are a pretty good person in what you do.<br>  6.Doing wrongly often cost the wrong doer little or nothing.  At times, they even seem to be rewarded for doing wrong.  This again goes to the lack of morals in society.<br>  7.Everyone wants to view themselves as a victim and they try to paint themselves as a victim for others to see and feel sympathy for.<br>  8.Many times, the way we act to others gives them the justifications they can then use to feel justified in cheating or doing wrongly toward others.  Such as a partner who refuses to have sex over a period of time or who seems to care little or do little for their mate.  Make sure you do not act in ways that make it easier to treat you badly.|`|izXIAxXGaa	If I went after every guy that cheated with every ex-girlfriend I have had, I would be a serial killer. Sometimes, you have to chalk it up and move on. If some guy gets your girl drunk and puts a date rape drug in her drink then yeah I would kick the living snot out of him. But from what you are telling me this cheating was consensual. <br>  People cheat because they do not feel secure about themselves. They need love but fill that void with all this hooking up with every one and any one. You could say we should go back to the times when guys and girls dated and there was no sex before marriage. But we can't turn back the clock to the 1950s. It is what it is. <br>  The dating scene has gone from arranged by family courtships, to dating whoever you want but no sex before marriage, to living together, and now there are all these hook ups going on.<br>  I don't know if you are a religious guy. Maybe go to a church or a temple or whatever place of worship you went to as a kid and find yourself a nice girl. The problem with dating the neighborhood bicycle is every one has had a ride. <br>  Let mom find you a nice girl. Get married, raise rug rats.<br>  Then your problem won't be her cheating on you, it will be you cheating on your income taxes to pay for all the diapers.

K2h6M1xqaa	Guilty for having natural human emotions?<br>  <br>  Come on.  What do you think?<br>  <br>  It is true that emotions can be managed and directed and chosen amongst, but that is not as easy as choosing which *actions* you take based on those emotions.<br>  <br>  Guilty feelings are damaging; they are in essence the result of judging yourself, and judging anyone is a very harmful thing as it limits people.  I prefer to use the word *gauge*, because it does not come with emotional baggage and it leaves one open to modification without any damage.<br>  <br>  Here's what you do: Simply look at yourself and assess whether or not your actions (or emotions) are those which you think are appropriate in a given instance, and then decide how you would prefer to see yourself behaving in similar future situations.<br>  <br>  Feeling love toward somebody, if you don't judge it or try to constrict it, is usually a beautiful, positive thing, so it's best to accept and enjoy it.  The actions you take based on your feelings are best then chosen so that they are always appropriate.  When you take away fear and judgment from your feelings, then the restrictions are raised and you will feel much more clear and it is *much* easier to choose appropriate reactions.  --Because you're not all tied up with pressures so that you are bouncing around like a little bomb waiting to go off.<br>  <br>  Cheers!|`|ad7ae5e8f17688d3566fad454e8fc09baa	I don't think you should feel guilty, HE should feel guilty for being kind of a jerk about it. Just because you like him doesn't mean he has to avoid you|`|63j0onthaa	personally, no i don't think you should feel guilty. It's not your fault you ran into him all the time. If you honestly don't think that you were being obsessive then there should be nothing to worry about. But, the question is.. do you still like him?|`|d36OrpbDaa	maybe you should be asking, "why did my friend decide to tell him that?"<br>  <br>  what kind of friend spills your secrets, especially in a negative way - after he asks why you're following him?|`|L0LUGdc3aa	Absolutely not. It's your choice to like him, and if you want to hang out with him it doesn't have to be because you like him. I've got a crush on my best guy friend.|`|WnGMzDFaaa	GOOD JOB!!!! GET BETTER!!!!!! HE'S GONNA GRADUATE ANYWAYS!!!!! WHATS THE POINT IN TELLING HIM!!!!! JUST LET IT PAST!!!! UNLESS HE'S NOT GOING TO COLLEGE AND WORK AT MCDONALDS!!!!! IF HE IS WORKING AT MCDONALD THEN GO FOR IT!!!!!
0vjUAmuuaa	just tell him how you feel and tell him you wish to be just friends though and if he isn't selfish he'll under sand|`|KLTktDV1aa	i tihnk u should wait a while longer and wait to see if he likes u back. Maybe u should ask aroud and see if he does. I dont think that u should risk your friendship by telling him. hope  i helped:)|`|6C5NDSBSaa	Don't risk losing the friendship...trust me!
unxgla59aa	it doesnt really matter that much about your breath if its with no tongue. you dont want to eat an onion or anything, but its not that big of deal. just let your first kiss be small and cute, and eventually you will have longer ones. and just go for it! girls like some confidence! and make sure your alone ;)|`|6m0eYhIKaa	Make it happen.<br>  Before you go out with your gf, make sure you brush your teeth or have some gum or something so chances are, you'll be set.<br>  If you're nervous, ask your gf if she would let you kiss her. <br>  That's what my bf did. You may think it's very straight foward, but chances are, she'll be happy that you took her feelings about it into consideration instead of just doing it.|`|16dZsUD8aa	don't worry to much about it, just kiss her before she has to wait to long.<br>  <br>  if you worry you'll mess up, so just go for it, but at the right moment.|`|h8Q3CTOJaa	just kiss her. i wouldnt matter if u mess up.|`|AdKlu3nGaa	lololololol rape.|`|7AndmAg4aa	everyones nervous. just do it when it seems like the right moment. do it where you are alone etc... good luck!
JGDwmFscaa	dude i know exactly how you feel, when i like a guy I sometimes act indifferent specially if he was someone that broke up with me. Who broke up with who? If you did then don't expect her to show you any signs of affections, she thinks you don't like her and a girl have to be prideful. If she calls you or finds any excuse to talk to you or "ask" you something then chances are that feelings are still floating around. Don't wait too long because ashes remain were fire once stood until it rains, hope you get it.|`|KQjhOdsIaa	tell her to suck your dick|`|1xWcQwpBaa	There's no reason that you can't ask her directly unless your mouth is wired shut, then you could write it down on a piece of paper.|`|eFW05AOUaa	hmm well from a girls perspective<br>  is she always talking to you?<br>  wanting to be by your side or hang out all the time?<br>  wanting to be closer to you?<br>  Those are signs.|`|TZhwQfSgaa	Does she appear to be wherever you are? <br>  Does she not act like her normal self around her?|`|rd5468H1aa	If she stares at you, then that's a major hint right there.|`|FomIa9jQaa	tell a friend to ask her...|`|CX3QUgLtaa	Well if you guys went out before, maybe share some inside jokes that you guys had. She might be a little bit nervous around you since you had a past and not comfortable. Just start by spending time with her, call her or text her at night just to say good night, start talking to and hangout more. I am sure she will like you again and takes things from there. But don't just rush and ask her, it all takes time <br>  good luck|`|yRIYBX4iaa	If she plays with her hair while talking to you is a big sign.  Also see if she really dolls herself up for you.  If she really likes you, she'll want to look her best.  ie. caking on the makeup, loading on the perfume, wearing a low cut something.  So keep you senses open!  Happy Hunting!|`|d99eRVlGaa	seriously sometimes guys over estimate girls liking them. If she is in another relationship then she probably wants to make you jealous but if she isn't just simply talk to her but dont go agro over her!|`|xO9HeDWCaa	Yes, you can ask her. Ask her!|`|2hR9KKl5aa	ask her|`|EFMvJIJ7aa	ask her best friend|`|nYF9DCB8aa	slap her and say "I love you bi.t.c.h"!|`|WVeKHhwNaa	if she flirts constantly with you, if she calls you a lot just to say hi and see what you are doing, if she ditches her friends to hang out with you, and if she gets mad or jealous if another girl is trying to get with you.|`|qZwGwyRBaa	if she sees u a lot she likes you just go up to her and say if u like me again be a man
xvey8ixPaa	Tell your folks, Then tell the principal and then if nothing is done call the district offices and sk to speak to the district lawyer. This usually gets attention of people that should be able to stop this behavior. It is illegal and adults should be told. really.|`|en74VE9uaa	go to the bully and tell her to back off or youll make her regret what she has done. thats what older siblings are for. step in and make sure you tell your sister|`|QcRsv7hEaa	Eh, I will be the first to tell you the never-listened-to advice of tell your parents. Having some prick pissed at your sister for reporting a bully will have better for her in the long run than just tolerating this crap.

I would also suggest writing down his good points, what you like/love about him. How he helps make your life better.<br>  <br>  I feel it is also a mental thing - you need to mentally change your view of him. See him in a different light. <br>  <br>  Imagine if something terrible happened to him or you, what would be some of the first things that would go through your mind? Would they be about him? Probably.<br>  <br>  If you put a negative view on almost anything, you can dislike it. Put a positive view on it and you will learn to like it. Change how you see him. Try the e-book at <a href="http://www.bringbackthespark.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.bringbackthespark.com</a> - they give great suggestions on ways to get out of a rut and to think and do things to have a warm, intimate relationship - it's only about $35 so it's worth a try to get him "back" again. Lots of women would love to get hugs and kisses when they get home. Good luck. Learn to value what you have.|`|81cb1ce39da4213ebe7cbc833cc3f808aa	Sounds like you're not happy with yourself some how. It isn't him, you are projecting. We should never expect another person to make us feel fulfilled all the time, but we find that it happens in the beginning of a relationship. We are so infatuated, that person fills a lot of the emptiness we might otherwise have. Now that reality has sunk in, it sounds like you resent him a little for no longer meeting ALL of your emotional needs. But he was never meant to, that has to come from you (or a higher power, I should say).<br>  <br>  You should concentrate on giving, and your needs will be met. Try to be the best person towards him that you can. After all, the truest measure of a person is how he/she treats those closest to them. Be a true friend, see what his needs are, and be kind. Your anger will resolve itself if you do these things first. Good luck.|`|DkVofG9paa	Nothing is wrong with you.  Your losing interest in your husband.  It's normal after a long period of time together, and thats whey they say you have to fight to stay in love.  it's not easy! Start doing 'date night' to get that spark back.  reflect to yourself if your still in love with him, or if you just love him.  This is a hard phase to get by.  how long have the two of you been together?  I read this book a long time ago that deals with couples losing interest in each other.  it suggested that the both of you write down what brought you two together, what you love about each other and what you cant live without about him.  so why dont you write down a page of why you love him.  concentrate on the positive things, the cute little things he does.. and definitely work to get that spark back unless your just not in love with him anymore and you want a new flame.|`|AA10248966	Get hormone testing just to start.

You are simply going through what every couple go through. The routine of life, get up go to work then go home do house chores and then to bed just to have to do it all over again. You let the routine of life come between yourself and your husband and when you realize what has happened often times it is to late. This is not just your fault but his as well. You need to invest into your selves as a couple again. Make it a mission to conquer his love like he needs to conquer yours. The first thing is communicate. You need to tell him how you feel. Never assume that one knows what the other needs or feel, you need to ask so that there won't be any misunderstandings.  Second you need to make time for each other. Take a trip some were, just the two of you and explore each others interest as well as sexually, in  different surroundings.  It's about breaking the routine. It's not all about sex but it can be used as a tool to strengthen your bond. That's what sex is for to unite and make tight and alright your marriage. Cory, I know!  All is not lost, you just have to work at it and it will take time but if you persist the reward can be well worth the the fight. I hope it all works out.|`|bqoE39jLaa	You love him, but obviously not "in love" with him. Do the right thing for the both of you, and any children that you might have; either grow-up, mature, accept responsibility for your wedding vowels, or face the facts and ask for a divorce so he can get what he deserves, and you deserve-HAPPINES.|`|WsFbhxZyaa	Well I need more details.  How old are you? Are you interested in anyone else? Have any of you been unfaithful?  But with the info you gave I am making the assumption that you are just going thru a rough time in the relationship.  My advice go back to what made you marry him in the first place.  Think of all the good things about him.  <br>  hope it helps|`|kGSZvLxbaa	You're probably just bored of he same routine and need something to revive your relationship. Why not go out for a romantic dinner? Or a vacation? Be creative and try and have a lil fun and let him surprise you and you surprise him.

7PGxqRfZaa	Move on dude. Its over, get use to it. Go out and try to find another girl. Good luck man.|`|j5F1TuA9aa	I think there must have been something going on with you two that you weren't aware of but it really bugged her. It is unfair to you that she didn't talk to you about it at all and just broke up with you. I think you shouldn't just give up, there is a chance she will regret it. But don't get your hopes up. You have to stay strong and expect the worst. She might just need some time, but it might just be time for this to be over. Girls are weird and believe me, if she broke up with you it really is what is best for her and i know she put a lot of thought into it.
oPomvXgJaa	I recently went through something like you are experiencing. A few months ago, I realized how awful my friends really are. They don't accept me for me, they are homophobic, biphobic, and several other phobics. They called me a slut in front of our church pastor because I got my tragus pierced. at first, I had no idea what was wrong, why I was just now noticing it. I still don't know why it randomly hit me that I had seriously sucky friends. When I realized this, I cut ties for a little bit. I didn't talk to them, made new friends (that turned out to be real friends), and became slightly anti-social for about a week while I figured things out. In the end, I realized that they weren't friends. They were only acquaintances. People I partially got along with, but didn't connect with at an emotional and mental level. If you are going to be separated after graduation, but you really don't think you will be able to make it through your last couple of months, then I would do something that might sound stupid, but it will help! Get a calendar or make your own. Mark the day of graduation, not as graduation day, but as the last day you will have to be with her. Count down the days until you get to get away from her. The ability to mark off another day off the countdown will organize the idea of separating yourself from her in frot of you, instead of just in your mind. It will make it seem more tangible.<br>  <br>  Hope I could help!|`|AcmfbJVpaa	you have turn to be a fine young lady<br>  and you will go places on life|`|AA10953999	Welcome to life, where once you mature and grow as an adult you realize the friends you have in high school are mostly superficial jerks. Keep your options open with them because they too will mature as they age, usually. No use in burning bridges but keep your distance if you really cant stomach them anymore.|`|2rXETYrFaa	I feel for you hun...but what your going through is called growing up and quite normal. Your maturing and your friends are not,I wouldnt worry too much,after you graduate you will be so busy with your life things will just change. If you must deal with dropping some of your old friends,im sure real valid reasons will pop up so you can honestly say to them,your too busy,etc.All through your life this may happen no matter what age you are,people change,situations change and then our friends change,its normal and we all go through it.You sound like a very level headed person and know where you are going,im sure you will get through this and move on to a new stage in your life.Good luck  in your future and enjoy your life.
zxQT3Uo5aa	You are no longer the same, nor is he.  You have fond memories and he probably will too.  But, the changes that time has brought into your live may have separated you more than you imagine.  Look forward to seeing him again.  Be prepared for the possibilities that what you had may be gone forever.  If you are able to reconnect, it will be in a new way, no longer the same.|`|dfPqakmsaa	That's exactly what happened to me and my boyfriend of one year now   :)<br>  <br>  Tell him you like him and start hanging out and see how things go.

QODJNf1oaa	Make him a collage of you two, theres alot of cute stuff you can get at target that allows you to do this. Make a CD with all of the songs that remind you of him, including your song together - if you have one. Guys LOVE when girls bake for them, so find out his favorite sweets & add a little twist by putting something sweet with food colouring on it (or maybe use the valentines hearts - put out all the "I love you's" and put them on). Depending on how old you are, you could buy really cute lingerie & surprise him at the door. I'm sure he'll love whatever your decide to do. gluck!|`|jJwuMTSqaa	What is he in to?<br>  <br>  Maybe tickets to watch his favorite sports team, or tickets to a concert/show.|`|699ff79ff7efb620adfafa8aea8f3bcaaa	recreate your first meeting.

What I did for me and my husband's first anniversary was cook him a great dinner with candle lights on the table and some wine and then we I had made us a bath full of bubbles and candles all around and we just soaked in the hot tub for awhile and talked and then afterwards when he walked into our bedroom I had heart candles all around the bed and we....well u get the rest! It was very romantic!|`|wytXPoBfaa	wow most have kind of just given you joke answers huh? sorry.<br>  well what my husband and i did for our one year anniversary was we did everything we did for our first date.<br>  we mini-golfed, we went to the same restaurant and then a movie. <br>  it was fun and real cute in my opinion =).|`|ivejg4whaa	Make him a cute little scrapbook type of thing filled with quotes and pictures and stuff and decorate it.

K2QwEM4raa	Most people can't stay friends after a breakup because someone still cares. The best thing you can do is what he asked and leave him alone. If and that is a big if he changes his mind then you will have to make a decision on if you can trust him to take him back. they almost al ways say they either need time or want to e friends as an easy way to let you down. Sorry!|`|OOptQPnFaa	i think right now he's just blowing off steam try letting him be by himself for awhile. and just ingore him and just go your own way for a bit you might find yourself friends again with him but if not you will met someone else who know how great you can be. trust me i know these things been there done that. ;) good luck!|`|Vkv0Ba1faa	It's best not to be friends for some time after breaking up. Take this time for both of you to settle down and get back to your own lives. It would be difficult if you break up today and be friends with your ex on the next day because things just don't happen that easily.|`|D45qGZO4aa	if u weren't putting out. you should have. that makes a guy happy. <br>  <br>  now u HAVE to put out if u want him to like you again.|`|iGZWeWwBaa	?

He feels like ur dad due 2 da age diff(tho i dont think its 2 much). He feels like he has 2 take care of u like a little baby. u'r just a kid 2 him .If this is the case, my advice wud be, ok he maybe a crush but the chances of u goin around with him is pretty slim. Dont lose heart yet, listen 2 the 2nd interpretation<br>  2)he maybe interested in u. if u guys get 2gether, he'll prove 2 b a very protective bf, not only coz of the age difference but also coz he feels protective of u.mayb its in his nature. he'll then behave like ur dad, like his only aim in life is to see dat ur safe. if this is the case, then it'll get pretty romantic 4 u 2 have a guy who'll always keep u safe but beware, he may also get pretty overprotective and possessive, so u need 2 keep some space 4 urself<br>  NOW to find out which case his response belons to; Simple just ask him straight:DO YOU LIKE ME? that's it!!!if he says Yes, then congratulations and best of luck and hope you remember to keep ur space<br>  if he says no, then just move on. Just be friends with him ,take his advice if u need it, &  can even turn 2 him if some other jerk is troubling you or hitting on u. I think it's awesome 4 a girl 2 have a senior guy help her out with that. Either ways, dont lose heart, just ask him & if he rejects u, then next time u meet him , DO NOT create that akward silence around him ,just be normal and friendly or else u'll lose him as a friend also<br>  ANSWER MINE PLEEEASE<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AvgSHwhUWrRbiTWIoTyqzW4jzKIX;_ylv=3?qid=20090225001710AAGvOSA">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|o5TV8KSLaa	he loves you like a daughter.<br>  not in a sexual away unless he is a physco.<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=An8LEH7yU3TM_r4u9rYJOiLsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090226192817AAc5LC9">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|h0ZdSxQiaa	3 years is not that much so he cant think like that but i guess he doesnt like you in a way that you like him, more like as a family!!|`|AA10996168	incest !!|`|34EBzIL6aa	he sounds like a whackjob.  move on
Rrpb5aLMaa	Oh my god honey, You are almost exactly where my best friend was years ago. Stop now. She isn't as educated as you, She works at a payday loan company making 10.00 hr but let me tell you what your life is going to be in 10 yrs. You will be waking in the morning getting the kids ready for school, getting ready for work, leaving ( he will still be in bed), you will be at work all day while he is out at the shooting range or fishing or what ever he wants to do, When the kids get out of school they will be at a baby sitter for a couple of hours, he will eventually pick them up, When you come home you will cook, clean, help the kids with home work, give them baths, put them to bed while he sits on his growing @ss and complains about how much his day sucked because the kids were arguing or something since he took care of them for an amazing couple of hours. Get out now before it is to late and you get pregnant, I am telling you he may be your first but their is many, many better men out there that have your same drive.|`|779f397084aa4666983d22c2e4d1a290aa	clearly he's not as ambitious as you are.. and i think that will have a lot to do with your compatibility in the future, to be able to actually have a family and such. i realize you probably don't want to hear that you should break up with him, but really.. it's either that, or convincing him to straighten out and have a few goals or something.|`|AA11596133	Just accept the fact that he does not want to be your puppet, and because you two have different life goals, this is JUST a temporary fling.<br>  <br>  DO NOT plan on changing him OR changing him by forcing him to get married or have kids, OK?|`|gAuIixm6aa	Well why are you telling US?

You must find an intelligent and smart and nice man. This guy seems like a low class lazy bum as you describe him. Even if you think he is tall and looks good one day you will get fed up with him and divorce. You need a man who at least makes 100k a year or he could end up asking for spousal support or something.|`|YUkwTD2gaa	it seems to me that he's just using you - even though he has feelings for you, you know that this isn't right. it is completely unfair for you, and you seem like a great person - and he's taking advantage of that. so i suggest that you should talk to him and tell him how you feel about it, and if this is to continue - you are going to break it off with him. good luck!|`|ZHJuK1QNaa	Get rid of him!  Unless you are looking for a life long project. He's not going to move on.  He has it made!  Why work if everything you want or need is being handed to you.  <br>  You are driven and have goals. Good for you!!!!!!!  You are doing exactly what you should be doing.<br>  He on the other hand, has one goal; keep you around so he doesn't have to do anything.<br>  You are way too different.  Move on to better things.  There are a lot of sharp guys out there, don't settle for this.<br>   Enjoy your life and your education!|`|bu6BhCnpaa	When i met my bf he was working at a garden shop and playing in a band.  i said, look...i really like you, and i dont know where this might go...but if you dont go back to college and get a degree this wont work out...<br>  <br>  so...he went back to school.  He struggles a bit, but is going for business...he may have a crappy job one day, but at least he will have a degree and get paid more than if he did not.  I will make enough money to support my family on my own if i needed to...but I want options to stay at home the first year of my child's life, or take an extra week off during the year.  My momw as never able to do that because my dad worked in construction and she carried all of the benefits.  <br>  <br>  I dont want to be the one with all fo that pressure. <br>  <br>  That said...my bf has his quirks, he doesn't vacuum, he always leaves his milk glasses out (he loves milk too...isn't it a strange thing??!?!).  He has really bad adhd, so its hard to get him to focus on one thing or not focus on soemthing pointless...he will spend 8 hours cleaning dvds and organizing them, when he really jsut needs to clean up the garage for his parents...he gets into trouble for that. BUT i have my weaknesses...i hate doing laundry (something he is great at), and I am good at making lists and making sure things get done, and he doesnt get upset with me anymore for telling him...leave the dvds alone and get to work on this...you can do them on your own time.  he learned that it snot me being mad or scolding, jsut trying to get thigns done, and keeping him on track.<br>  <br>  SO...we know eachother;s weaknesses...you have to say to your bf...if you want to stay home, then you cook and have that ready for me.  then help him with the dishes.  Tell him to fold laundry when he watches tv, even if you do most of the loads...at least he folds.  you might have to give him things to do so he learns what kind of work should be shared.<br>  <br>  if he doesnt shape up...why should you have to care for him...i would kick him out on his butt...if hes not willing to work to be n a realtionship with you then hes not worth it...<br>  <br>  ona  side note...i NEVER expect anything from anyone...noone should.  you WORK for what you get...you dont sit there and say Ill get money form my wife!  My bf's family is impossibly rich...he is banking on inheritance...and i told him...we may or may not get any...but there is NO way that that is going to be what we live on...we will make our own money, and that inheritance will be a nice additive, but not somethign that we count on to live.  Your paycheck may be more than what your bf ever makes, but he should not count on that for his well being...he should be able to take care of himself and your family should soemthing happen to you.  and if he doesnt shape up and your dont separate from him...and you get married one day...make him sign a prenump!|`|qCx0qXdfaa	you need to have a serious conversation with him and tell him straight up what you think and what your scared of.  im also an aspiring doctor, and there is no way im letting any man ride on my coat tails.  im in a serious relationship but my guy wants to be a psychiatrist or soemthing of the sort so he wants to work and is driven and everything.  def break up if he doesnt get his act together.  you might love each other, but he could just be taking advantage of you.  what a great life for him... and what a stressful crappy life for you.|`|qoHOHDIaaa	he sounds like a loser, and you sound like you're going places. dump him. that sounds harsh, but look at the facts. you're pre-med, and this guy is basically a man version of gold-digger. if he really cared that much about you, he'd at least try to help around the house, since he's there so much, anyway. relationships are mutual exchanges. you cook and clean and go to school, and he doesn't really have a future. get rid of him.|`|msBuq9gbaa	My advice is to break up with him and find a man who is more resourceful and has stronger goals.  You are clearly more ambitious than your boyfriend, so it's not going to work out in the long run.  Eventually, you are going to resent him for not contributing to the household chores, and that's not goo for your relationship.|`|8k380Hu7aa	Talk to him about it!!!!!  Email him this question if you're at a loss for words!!!!|`|0dMp7A3aaa	One of two solutions:<br>  <br>  A) You gather up some courage and maturely tell him that he needs to clean up his act and be more productive in the relationship. If you mean anything to him, he will comply and things will start to get better.<br>  <br>  If that does not work:<br>  <br>  B) Tell him that you've had enough and are through with putting up with this treatment. It isn't fair you do every ounce of work and he does nothing to help whatsoever. Break it off, immediately after saying this.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|DK6kYxmGaa	Dump him---he's not worth your time. Any man who is lazy, does not deserve such a great lady like yourself. My Italian family won't even allow me to date a guy like that----we grew up with the mentality that all men should be the providers of the home, and not the wife. <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|LwQtIe1Faa	You should most definitely be talking to HIM about this.  I mean, you guys have been in a relationship for two years, so you should have some sort of communication skills with each other.  <br>  <br>  If this is the first time that you have approached him on this, then talk to him about it, tell him what's up - everything - and give him room and time to improve. (i.e. let him attempt to make dinner some night, do the laundry, clean the dishes, pick up his own messes)  Pampering him occasionally isn't bad at all, but it seems as if this is what he expects of you.  So ask him - what his expectations are of you.  And if you disagree, tell him and give him your reasoning.  Ant then tell him what you expect of him and what you would like to get out of this relationship, because it should be give and take, not give and...give.<br>  <br>  If, however, this has come up in the past, I might consider breaking it off with him.  If he was any bit considerate of you, he would be helping you out a bit and giving you something in return (not to say that he doesn't already, because I'm sure you're with him still for some reason).|`|ujQb07SBaa	it seems to me that you need to break it off with him. i guess you could say that he is holding you down.<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AiF4UI27Gjo6nRQOdq701OHsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090226163952AA2UCqV">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>

7a9ca1e0d676415430d900245a7c2d25aa	My mom told me once "dont loan money you can't afford to give." I have loaned money to people and not only never saw the money, but never even saw the person again. I would just tell her next time she wants to borrow money that you don't have it to loan/give. You might let her know that it hurt your feelings a bit when she borrowed the money and didn't pay it back. I think your grandma probably knows that your aunt doesn't pay back when she borrows.

The first step is putting in the application, you have to let her know your out there, now that it seems has been accomplished. the next step is pursistance, you have to be around, a lot. you dont have time to be shy you need to insert yourself into her life in such a capacity that you cant be ignored. Soon you will be called back for an interveiw which is the time when you will need to demonstrate, (not verbalize, but through action) all the reasons that you are the best candidate, this will require a little research, you need to find out what she's into, hobbies, past times, music, movies, ect.  then you sell her on how you share these interests or at least have a general knowledge of them and how you can make here experience with these interests and the rest of life more enjoyable by being involved.

You really need to get outta this and do a back ground check you do not know who this guy really is nor what he has really done in his life time. If his own sister says they dont have a brother then you best believe something is definitely not right about him. He maybe wanted but you will never know cause you do not know what his real name and info is. Ask his siter whats his real name she knows and his dob. This has to be taken serious on ur part he could be a big murder or something but you want know. Marriage should be the last thing on ur mind right now a guy like this you dont even wanna be married to leaglly he can be using someone elses nm and ss# and ur married to them and not even know it. Research and get out this is no joke and nothing to over look. Anyone who changes their name will all ways have the same ss# this number never changes only the name does. Yes it is a legal marriage to the person who really holds that name ss# and dob and its not him the one standing in front  of you.

The days are bad but the nights are unbearable all i thought about who was my husband with at this very moment. Everyone is different how to deal with the pain but one thing we all have in common and that is the heart ache.One day one second what ever it takes just hang in there you can do this. Remember this you're never alone with your pain there are thousands of women going through what you are at the exact same time. I'm sorry i know I'm no help but there isn't a magic word that will take the pain away i wish there were. My husband cheated on me 11 years ago and I'm just now getting to where i can talk about it without crying. That's how deep the pain and hurt goes it's all the lies and betrayal that cuts deep. This is exactly what i did that helped me when i would get that sick feeling in the pit of my stomach and my head was filled with so many questions i wanted answers to i would write everything down. I would be crying so hard i couldn't even see the paper. I would call him name after name and the skank he was with. My nervses was causing my stomach to hurt what ever it was it came on like every 2 seconds.  It got so bad my hands couldn't keep up with all the thoughts in my head so i went out and bought a little hand held tape recorder and a lot of spare tapes. That helped get me through some very painful times. To this day i can't listen to them i really was in bad shape back then. I let my best friend listen to the very first tape i recorder and she started to cry and told me to stop the tape she couldn't handle it. She said she knew i was depressed but she had no idea i was that bad. If i can get through it anyone can believe me. If you want to e-mail me please do.|`|a0b1f8c0a89f6e9a6fb1048bcf570db3aa	Try to stop yourself from thinking about it. Do not lay there or sit there going over things. If you have things that remind you about it, get completely rid of them. I think I am getting better, knowing that I am finally walking in the opposite direction.

My husband cheated on me almost 2 years ago, and I still think about it every single day of my life. In retrospect, I wish I would have done things differently (as, not taking him back), but what's done is done.  We (in my opinion) don't have a strong relationship now. He is in denial and thinks that everything can go back to being peachy, but I disagree. In all honesty, I can't see myself growing old with him, and I am certain that in the near future..we will not be together. I have learned that it IS possible to forgive someone who does this to you, but you never forget.|`|tMLcCfmuaa	From my experience, I never forgot and never really let him have my heart again.

Well, someone told him that you like him, that's for sure. And that someone, if s/he knows that you posted this question in yahoo, s/he'll be telling that guy you like. that guy in return will use a name not his to answer your question with 'go get him!' something like that. Why? He likes you too! You said on the question he doesn't even know you sit beside him in english and spanish class, right? Well, actually he knows! But why does he pretend not to know you were there? It's because he likes you, and he doesn't want you to find out about it. He may be turned off if ever you'll discover his secret crush for you. He has low self-confidence, but he has a bit high level of pride. He didn't talk to you right? But what's more higher than his pride is his love for you, as i see it. And that will continue to rise as long as you and him get along with each other closer and closer.<br>  <br>  Here's my advice, tell him to meet with you at the park, alone. Of course he'll come (and he'll be coming with lots of money with his best shirt!). Talk to him honestly, seriously. Ask him what you want to ask him. Don't walk huts yet, or eat in a restaurant. Just spend time sitting with each other there asking questions that won't make you two sleep. After that, maybe he'll pop out the three-word common verse (I love you---ewww!!!! joke lol....).<br>  <br>  Maybe you'll be having a good relationship. But beware! he's the type that asks too much. Don't make him jealous or anything. Don't talk about your past bf's, don't flirt with other guys, always text him and always answer him honestly. If you make any of these, a very big possibility of problem will occur. Make your relationship the best of your relationship because he'll be doing the same with you. If possible, send me details if you've tried these things. Byebye!!!!<br>  <br>  By the way, the thing i said about that he'll be using a fake name to answer your (this) question is 50% possible. He maybe me, or anyone. But gor sure, he's not me. Im not in to such relationships but i like giving advises... Tatta!!! c",)|`|gbUKzTyVaa	it means:<br>  <br>  1) You're scoring just above "mentally retarded" on an IQ test<br>  <br>  2) You purposely try to dumb yourself down... you know what it means!<br>  <br>  3) He likes you, and has a MAJOR crush on you.<br>  <br>  4) He would go out with you.<br>  <br>  5) He's probably not going to ask you out, though.... but if YOU ask HIM out, he WILL SAY YES (100% CHANCE)... DEFINITELY!<br>  <br>  6) You need to learn to put more periods and commas in your writing... you're lucky I could decipher what you were saying.  It's almost impossible to understand something, when you don't have a comma. <br>  <br>  example: HERE IS YOUR WRITING<br>  <br>  then we were talking about this one girl and how they used to be friends with her last year but she was annoying cause she followed him everywhere and then he said he only liked it when girls followed if he like the girl so then he started smileing at me and saying you know what i mean like trying to give me a hint or somethin!<br>  <br>  HERES HOW IT SHOULD BE WRITTEN (easier to read, much?)<br>  <br>  Then we were talking about this one girl, and how they used to be friends with her last year... but she was annoying, cuz she followed him everywhere.  Then he said that he only liked it when girls followed him, IF he liked the girl.  Then he started smiling at me and saying, "you know what i mean".... Like he was trying to give me a hint, or something!<br>  <br>  EASIER TO READ??? lol<br>  <br>  7) #6 will help you out in the long run 100 TIMES more than #1-5 will... so take heed to writing well.<br>  <br>  8) He doesn't just like you, he wants to have sex with you.  Just putting that out there. All guys do.<br>  <br>  9) If you've liked him for a long time, there's a REALLY GOOD CHANCE that he found out you liked him one way or another- thus why he started liking you, very likely!<br>  <br>  10) IN ANY CASE: IF YOU LIKE HIM, AND HE DEFINITELY LIKES YOU... ASK HIM OUT! DON'T HESITATE! WHAT IF ANOTHER GIRL ASKS HIM OUT, OR HE LOSES INTEREST?|`|lg3wTxNqaa	he just wants some butt sex, give the man what he dreams about.|`|rIgqYmjYaa	Its always easier to look into a relationship from the outside, when you're in the relationship it's so much harder.<br>  <br>  He likes you plain and simple, but if you just let things hang in the air just constant flirtation nothing will come of it, honestly i don't see the big deal for the girl asking the guy.

The guy is definitely interested in you.  <br>  <br>  If it helps, think of men as dogs.   A dog will not hint around about what they want, they don't expect you to instinctively know... they show you what they want.   But in the same light, be careful not to train guys bad habits, because if you reward behavior that you don't appreciate, we'll keep doing it because we attribute rewards with doing something right.   A lot of this is because atleast in my experience, I didn't have many rewards.   I heard way more about what I did wrong or what I shouldn't do than I ever did about what I do right (a trend that continues today, even though 90% of what I do is "right").   The point being.... When this relationship progresses, set your boundaries, stick to them, and if he does something he isn't supposed to do, by all means don't reward him (don't be horribly mean but don't give an inch).|`|BMDkMyHTaa	yes. i think this boy likes you. and this makes it pretty clear. but if you're still unsure there are several ways you can test this. <br>  <br>  1. try getting into his personal space by taking a step closer. if he doesn't step back or gets closer then that's good!<br>  <br>  2. the next time this boy flirts with you and it's pretty clear, then say jokingly, "if i didn't know any better, i'd think you were flirting with me." and see what his response is to that.<br>  <br>  btw these signs mean that he wants to be closer with you, doesn't like that other girl that way, likes you as a friend and possibly more. try this out and see how much more.|`|SnqNqxn0aa	he definitely likes you!

Rm2qXSSgaa	A bit of advice Religion is one of those subjects you cant discuss with everyone. Because there are so many different beliefs. If she refuses to apologize then maybe you she should be the mature one and tell her if she is such a Bible stickler than she would know that she is wrong for getting mad at your own opinion. If she is a true friend she will apologize and move on. I have several friends of over 10 years and 3 are different religions we dont discuss it. good luck.|`|6bryNB1raa	pretty sad reason not to be friends no more just sort it out and laugh bout it|`|20da7e19a185ca8c01b2a311761afcd6aa	just say your sorry, and you dont think you guys should EVER talk about religion again since you both know where you stand. encourage her gradually.<br>  <br>  If that doesn't work, you dont need people to bring you down on what you believe in.|`|ZvOXs61caa	awww. you guys need to make up..... tell her your sorry...and its fine for you to feel differently about things... tell her it shows u both are strong opinionated ppl. tell her how much she means to you. maybe write it in a note.|`|OpiJAxr1aa	your not friends over that, wtf.<br>  just tell her its really stupid that the friendship has to end over something silly like that, and see what she says.|`|zmWotb1taa	she sould say sorry!|`|L2cLlrJnaa	im both, gosh dont be mean to me!!!!!|`|c119e854166ec9a0ae853836d9b4ae8aaa	you have to accept that some people will have a different opinion on the bible! some people read as though waht is written is set in stone and live their life by it, and others take waht they read and adapt their lives to that! i.e personally adopt that way that suits their needs!  u should not fall out over it! just accept that u have different acceptance of what is the lords word!!!!! and being christian that should not be a problem!

POFdWpUzaa	You sound pretty responsible on one hand, having a job, staying in school, being accepted to college. On the other hand you are still a kid, living off mom and dad. Without them you would have none of what you have. So, best to put up with them for a few more months. Soon you will be off to college and making your own way in life, anyway, as far as taking care of yourself and keeping yourself on trac with school. I don't know why they say no gaming but let you do other things. You'll have to come right out and ask them. Otherwise, just be cool, keep your grades up now that you got them back up, and tow the line. When you get to college, remember to keep yourself in check and keep the grades up, homework then gaming. Best of luck.

As long as you live under your parents roof and they are footing the bill you are not old enough to make your own decisions.  Unless they allow you to.  When you go to University I'm sure they will let you do your own thing.

I think it is a wonderful idea, and I was going to suggest the same thing.  It never occurred to me to accuse you of being spoiled up until that point, just fortunate, but the tone of your letter tells a different story. Poor me I have so much I just don't know what they should get me.   <br>  <br>  You are fortunate to have parents who can afford to indulge you in times like these.<br>  <br>   What is rude is calling people hoes after asking for their help.<br>  <br>   Why don't you visit a nursing home and volunteer for the day. Get the whole family involved , than go out for dinner afterwards. <br>  <br>  You would be surprised how good you will feel.  You will also see what it's really like to be lonely and depressed.
bu6BhCnpaa	ok...trust me...i know italians liek that...its exactly how they are!<br>  <br>  he needs to 1. not put himself out there so much.  he can court her and try to spend time with her, but he needs to take a deep breath and relax and not be so foreward.<br>  <br>  second...if this girl really doesn't feel the same...it probably has NOTHING to do with all of the great things about your friend...<br>  <br>  This remind me of my best friend...he liked me, and we were so close.  He is so smart, speaks 2 languages (hes german and grew up there), and we share a lot of the same interests and views.  He is so attractive and just a genuinely caring and good person.  Everyhtign about him was perfect...like your friend, but when i kissed him...there was no spark!  I was so upset by that, and unfortunately i broke his heart.  <br>  <br>  Its one of those things...i dont know why i couldnt think of him romantically...i even had a crush on him, but there was not that spark or desire...it was so weird.  i had a hard time dealing with that, as I am sure he did.<br>  <br>  Anyway, thats what this situation sounds like to me.  This girl probably thinks your friend is perfect on paper, and really wants to like him, but for some reason, unknown to her...there is a spark or small element that is missing, and she cant get past it.  So when he starts spouting his love to her, she gets freaked out.  <br>  <br>  Your friend's best bet is to lay off, and be friends iwth her.  I know it sucks, but he need sto relax.  Drinking excessively and talking about suicide is the BIGGEST turn off...and will scare her away even more...wven if she doesnt know, that is still not a good thing to say.  in time, she may see something different in him.  i did about my friend, but unfortunately we are both at points where we couldnt make it work anymore.<br>  <br>  Your friend sounds liek a good person, and he deserves a good girl.  If this girl is not it...if she doesnt feel for him what he feels for her, than its not real.  One day when a girl returns his feelings, it will be so much better and stronger, and there is not point in wasting your life with somone who doesnt care abotu you as much as your care abotu them,,,no matter how much you believe they are the one.|`|PxMNxytjaa	You need to tell your friend that its over and there are more fish in the sea. she obviously does not like him! hope i helped a little ((:|`|Y6YaMR34aa	i think that it is the girl.

 like that she would NOT be happy with him?  that he is not her TYPE?  that she likes someone else, who is nothing like him?  maybe if he tries to see it from her perspective... it will help him realize how disrespectful he is being to her.  because he continues to put her in this position.  it's mean.  he needs to leave her alone - either be her friend and shut up about his feelings, or stop hanging out with her completely.  it's just not fair to her.<br>  <br>  9)  i'm sure he's a fantastic guy.  but no one will ever truly believe it unless HE believes it too.  he should be more confident - not cocky, but self-assured.  he shouldn't rely on others to make him happy.  he should be happy even if nobody wants to date him.  it's difficult, but important.<br>  <br>  10) i suggest he get some short-term counseling if nothing else seems to help.  there's nothing wrong with talking to a person who's professional and has the skills to help you!!  it could be of great help to him. :)|`|nUdy9JRSaa	not to be an *** but sounds like YOU might be the babe for him.....|`|nydoais5aa	Dude , She wears  purple panties come on man ...PURPLE!

He may also need to seek help if he can't.|`|LCdejroAaa	ok yea he does need to stop being soooooooo needy and the girl might not be as in love with him as he is with her she probly just not the one you know you need to make sure that he doesnt kill himself over her shes not worth it!!!!|`|v30jAQuoaa	just tell him 2 be himself... and tell him 2 get in a comfortable position so he can be calm and be himself.... when your calm... you wont mess up... :] im sure he doesnt have to act... im sure hes a nice guy... :]<br>  <br>  answerr minee?|`|K2QwEM4raa	She is just not into him the way he is her and he needs to quit wasting his time.

Your sister has a problem and until she deals with it she should not be allowed to see the kids...especially if she is loaded on drugs. Your mother can go to social services and get help there and also contact the DA's office and ask them if she can legally get child support from your sister. If so, then she can find out what she can do to collect it. best wishes to your mother and all of you.|`|OL3MUunlaa	Your mom should contact legal aid, in the meantime she can get aid for the kids.  I honestly don't know how she will even be able to get anything from your sister since she is using.  It's probable that anything she may have is going to support her habit, so I wouldn't count on that.  You said that the fathers are refusing to help.  Mom should go to court and request paternity testing.  They can refuse all they want, but dna doesn't lie.  They should be responsible for these kids too, but she needs to understand that once testing is done, and paternity is established, they as fathers can assert their rights also.  These poor babies being born in such a horrendous situation, thank God they have you and your mom.  Good Luck to all of you

392b18ae97259a7518f51868eb7ea463aa	Of course.<br>  <br>  Suppose I didn't like a girl and was trying to distance myself from her as to keep from send her the wrong message/ lead her on, I would avoid using "we." If I liked her, on the other hand, I would say "we" every chance I had to get her to think about the two of us as one couple, together. <br>  <br>  A lot of it has to do with the subconscious, but it is still meaningful.|`|IlSGU9Yzaa	Means nothing.

di6p10Ifaa	I love the idea. That gives whoever is not a drinker the chance to spend time with everyone and not feel awkward. So later on people who wish to go out and have a drink may do so. Excellent plan! Save some money too!|`|lzIWgzA7aa	Is the rehearsal dinner at a restaurant?  And does that restaurant serve alcohol?  If so, it's going to be hard for you to control people having alcohol.<br>  <br>  I think not having alcohol at the rehearsal dinner is a good idea.  My fiance and I decided against having an open bar, but we're still going to have wine and beer, and if people want cocktails, they can pay for them themselves.  I like to think of it as quality control.  If people don't get too sloppy the night before the wedding, they'll be refreshed for the actual day, and then they can get drunk.|`|BZwZRYe5aa	It's your decision, your wedding, so you shouldn't worry too much about other people unless you are making a distinctly anti-etiquette decision. I think a rehearsal dinner without alcohol is a good decision. Prevents hangovers and people making fools of themselves, which could possibly affect the wedding day. You may want to consider just a smidgen of champagne to satisfy the WASPs.|`|vyL7yEleaa	personally... i think having alcohol at a wedding is stupid, i have seen to many wedding get destroyed because of guest getting drunk.<br>  <br>  working at a tux shop i had 3 tux's come back one Sunday covered in blood and with stab wounds and one even had a bullet hole in one. so this is just my personal opinion it's a bad idea to have alcohol at a wedding.|`|qjQbIxsMaa	We're not even having a champagne toast b/c Groom and one Groomsman can't drink due to medical issues. Just sparkling cider.<br>  <br>  I think chosing to not have alcohol at the rehearsal is fine. You don't want anyone drinking too much before the actual wedding anyway.|`|fvyDx1Zaaa	I don't think that's a bad idea at all. Too many people drinking alcohol at one time, before the big day..may lead to a baddd big day. <br>  good luck|`|tzDbzR18aa	nothing wrong with it.|`|jPJ9MTCwaa	I would be fine with that....although my favorite drink is a shirley temple even at the age of 25.  :)|`|4POGapREaa	It's not a necessity but I'm an adult & I don't like restrictions being put on me.  Why can't I buy a drink at the bar?  I've made arrangements to attend your function so . . .|`|NvW6voPJaa	Hi, I don't see that as a problem.  The problem I do see is that usually the rehearsal dinner is the night before the wedding.  And....if you are going out for a combined bachelor/bachelorette party with drinking the night before the wedding?  Yikes!  I see sick bridesmaids and groomsmen (and possibly the bride and groom?) the next day.  If you are not big drinkers, then this won't be a problem.|`|8bTder08aa	I think that's fine, although if the rehearsal dinner is at a "fine dining" restaurant and there are any "foodies" in attendance, they might like to have wine with their meal.<br>  <br>  My feelings are that the alcohol/no alcohol question is at the discretion of the host.  When I attend a social function of any kind, I am going for the companionship and sharing of the occasion, and that does not require alcohol.<br>  <br>  I also think that people who attend a function and complain about the food/drink the host serves are incredibly rude.  I was taught by my mother that a polite guest assumes that the food and drink served by the host are the best they can provide, and you honor them for sharing with you. whether it's lemonade from a mason jar and a piece of store-bought cake or champagne and a custom cake from a high-end bakery, doesn't matter.  You're there as the guest and should be honored by the sharing of food and the occasion.|`|l43NSgHyaa	That's fine.  The rehearsal isn't as formal as the wedding and it's also not as long or elaborate.   Therefore, it's fine not to offer alcohol.   The last rehearsal I attended didn't have liquor and it was held at a really nice place.   But, we did have unlimited soda,coffee and tea.|`|KuUKggoraa	That's wonderful you don't want to kill the inside of your body!! Lol. No there is nothing wrong with that and I think it's rather practical. Yes the wedding itself should have alcohol as it is a special occasion. (Oh and to Jessica, I do enjoy shirley temples, also!)|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	I don't see what the problem would be. I've been to rehearsal dinners that didn't serve alcohol and no one had any issues with it.
PeoOb4aHaa	I don't see the problem here.  As long as everyone understands the terms of the relationship, you two can share him politely.|`|cggkcAC5aa	shame on u|`|m1493Va4aa	you should feel guilty<br>  that was messed up<br>  <br>  who knows maybe they would have gotten married and had a wonderful life and all because of you its ruined!<br>  <br>  good job so called "BFFL"<br>  <br>  now you have to live with it for ever<br>  <br>  -Kandy

AA10166421	it is not the question of education; but socialisation.<br>  human society is made up of complex behavioural patterns.<br>  social norms are prefixed under thinking pattern of human behaviour for better society. hence the role of social psychology enters in this context.<br>  read about the boy brought up wolfs does not develop his brain like human. hence social thoughts predominant human brain for social living. here the family as a social institution lead the role. sexual act is basically for procreation in family life as father, mother and relationships for better society. hence the role play is more important in human society.<br>  sexual act as instinctual behaviour does not mind social norms. hence society encourages healthy family life for better future by following social upbringing. lack of such human upbringing due to various factors contribute the situation as mentioned in the question.<br>  hence prevention is better than cure in such situations with better social living conditions.<br>  so time and exposure heals such wounds.|`|5f232a0e5670e2a5079c788abe7190a5aa	Her therapist said it would  be okay to reinact this? what hell kind of therapist is she seeing.. That is not right and I think deep down you know this. How could she want to do this knowing what happend to her and saying she actually enjoyed it! Geez does she not know the difference of it all. <br>  I would say decline and also on the rape fantasies which probably brought this all out into the open in the first place. that is just sick!!! <br>  You are not going to be supportive in the long run when she starts having flash backs then points the blame on you.|`|VmLZFN4Taa	I think it would probably just give her flashbacks..I would say don't do it, but if she really wants to go ahead|`|2xmW4eo0aa	I would say don't do it, but if she really wants to go ahead...........|`|jpyy7Rjbaa	i say go for it. sounds like she' really into it.....|`|tA1ztvXaaa	I don't know where to begin with this question, I dated a man who use to want me to do this, it wasn't so bad at first but then he started becoming obsessed with it.  He not only wanted me to call him daddy in bed but out, in the front of my son.  At first I thought it was cute thinking he was family minded and wanted my son to call him daddy.  I even got all dressed up in a sexy school outfit with heels, because i just thought it was a little fantasy he had, I even put my hair in pigtails Then I realized it was more then that.  He took it more extreme he wanted me to call him daddy in the front of his coworkers and if i refused he would literally break up with me.  He would say things like "it's normal for a woman to call her man daddy" my reply use to be well if your'e my daddy why are you not doing what a daddy does, which is taking care of me? making sure the bills are paid and I have no worries.  For years we went back and forth with this DAddy thing until right before our last break up he started saying things to me especially during sex "I OWN YOU" how do you like being owned and things like "WHEN FATHER's day comes, you're getting me a card, I was shocked to say the least.  that's not all eventually he started coming into the bathroom while i was there wanting to bath me off, if i used the toilet he wanted to clean me up it was scary.  I am telling you now, if your g/f is calling you daddy there is something deeper especially if it leaves the bedroom.  Had my EX just left it alone and not become so obsessed with it I wouldn't have been so alarmed and found it so easy to leave him the last time.  I felt i could help him see there was something not normal about this.  Especially given the fact that he was abused physically, and I also think perhaps sexually as a child because even our sex life was dominated most times and if I ever tried to show him I was enjoying it he would stop a certain thing or position that I liked because sex was ONLY about him.  I say get the hell out of the relationship if your woman sees you as a daddy, it means she's one not woman enough, probably immature or worse has psycological issues that YOU cannot cure.  Men want women who are confident and twirling hair and speaking in a whinny voice isn't attractive...GET OUT|`|851bf075860be83c579bd47dd0a07b55aa	Hey i'm only a teen and don't know much (especially in this subject), but if you don't feel comfortable with it, then tell her so, do make something you enjoy uncomfortable.|`|AA12181642	Well, as long as they are "roles" you "play" I guess there is no problem.. <br>  The problem with this particular role is that for her it is an experience that has caused her certain instabilities or difficulties - whether she felt ashamed before or after the act - for instance, imagine a girl who has been raped, did not enjoy it, was forced to do it, hurt while doing it, imagine she wants to "re-enact" a rape... wouldn't sound right, would it?<br>  Rape fantasies are common, you know the usual ideal constellation of power, authority, pleasure and submission.. but if this fantasy goes back to a complex phase in your life... then you might not enjoy it that much, right?<br>  <br>  I would have the fear, that by "re-enacting" that, you might trigger something you wont be able to stop.. and you will be stuck with the daddy role for ever.. <br>  <br>  of course i might be completely wrong.. good luck!
FdNbyvJ9aa	I think he's probably shy, everyone's a different person on the phone than in person, he needs more time to get close to you. <br>  And in bed that's his thanggg. He's dominant and fearless there- cause he knows he's pleasuring his woman;) And if you guys talk on the phone alot, then he's not cheating- being on the phone & being with another woman at the same time is very unlikely, but yah, he would be way more comfortable if you guys saw each other more.<br>  Also, if you only saw him 7 times in the past 3 years, he's NOT in it for the sex. I think it's cute he wants to stay with you despite your strict dad :)|`|zxQT3Uo5aa	What do you expect?  7 times in three years is not a relationship although I see why you want to think that it is.  If you can't see a guy more frequently than that, you shouldn't even try to have a relationship.  <br>  <br>  Don't think that your time limitations are limitations to him.  It gives him the opportunity to have other girlfriends.<br>  <br>  But what about you?  Do you find this satisfying?  You are a casual sex partner.  Don't you desire more?  I guess it is awkward.  You don't have the time to get to know each other.  You should examine whether you have grounds to be sexually active with him.|`|ajK4OLROaa	i not sure what to tell u........but if u love him go 4 it and if u don't forget it and move on|`|699ff79ff7efb620adfafa8aea8f3bcaaa	you skipped some steps in your relationship. You're doing this guy but you don't know that you like him or have much in common with him. Why not draw the line in bed for a little while and get to know him outside of bed as a person. Or, if he won't see you out on the street, you know he's ashamed of you and is just using your body. Good luck.|`|OOs7FoOGaa	as a fellow guy, we are too lazy to be affectionate once we have the person we wanted. we're affectionate in bed because we kinda have to be, or else it would kill everything. but uhh i think if you're gonna date someone you should see them more than once a month. nevermind the fact that having sex with someone because you dont have much time with them, is kinda stupid. you arent gonna get anything but an orgasm from that.|`|rqeEhVvXaa	It means you have wasted 3 years of you life.

I'm unsure as to why you don't understand it. You two obviously only have a sexual relationship and since you don't see each other that often, it's never grown to anything more. When he sees you, its pretty much guaranteed that you'll have sex, so why waste his time talking or getting close?<br>  <br>  My best suggestion, either get used to having a purely physical relationship with no emotional connection, or find a guy can actually see you more than once a month and who can hold up a conversation without having to have sex first. Good luck|`|6e68ce4ae0cc1fabdc0a003e64178809aa	I gotta be straightforward honest with you.   You sound like his "booty call" girl.... if he's not made the effort to be with you on a more permanent basis after three years, and you're just having sex when he does come.... yeah.... <br>  <br>  If you don't want to believe me, stop having sex with him and see if he keeps coming.|`|Dd3NaJzsaa	It means he's just not that into you, he likes getting laid and thats it im  really sorry to say this but it doesnt sound like your boyfriend and girlfriend it sounds like your fuc# buddies my advice enjoy the ride or get off now before you really get hurt.|`|9jNK7tV9aa	it means that your relationship is absolutely not working out.<br>  you don't seem to fit together.|`|Uxq3l0kcaa	He is only in it for the sex.

I know this type of man because I was like that when I was in college. He is only with you for sex. It sounds like you have low self-esteem just from how you seem to be perceiving this whole relationship.<br>  <br>  Someone who had more respect for themselves would demand more from a guy then just having sex when he feels like it. I am not sure how old you are but you sound young. You need to be focused on one thing and that is school.<br>  <br>  Ask yourself these questions. What do you want out of a relationship? Are you getting that out of this relationship? Or are you simply holding onto a fantasy of what you want and hoping that eventually he will fulfill what you are looking for.<br>  <br>  sounds like to me that you are in denial about a lot of things.<br>  <br>  I would say stop the sex for a while, tell him exactly what you just typed above and see how he responds. Then see if he still comes around. If he doesn't then you know that was all he was after. If a guy is really into you he wont stopp calling just becuase you want to chill with out sex for awhile because you were feeling uncomfortable.

I can't fault him because it is a hard thing to do... to lay yourself out there to be smacked hard with rejection if things don't work, but he's just gotta know that if he never takes the chance, the answer will always be "no".

And make sure he understands how important these things are to you, and that you will not change your mind for any reason. <br>  <br>  You can explain all of this without acting like you are expecting him to propose. And don't let the relationship get too serious. If it has, then tell him you want to back off because it's going to be years before you can get serious about a guy. Be upfront about your plans; be honest; and if he doesn't "catch" it there is nothing wrong with accepting a proposal on one condition. That you will have a long engagement. Or if he doesn't want that, then tell him you can't make that commitment right now.|`|PBdPD748aa	honestly - my advice to you is dont let it get to that.<br>  <br>  make him understand NOW your intentions, because it will hurt him and perhaps your relationship once he has gone through the effort of getting you a ring and working himself up for the big moment. no matter how you say it, by then its plain rejection.<br>  <br>  talk to him now. sit down together talk about it casually, make your point that you are NOT ready for marriage. say it the best way you know how, but make sure he understands. its the best thing you can do for yourself and for him.|`|jEC8Ctp5aa	Tell him all of this stuff TOMORROW.<br>  <br>  Don't give him one more day of possibly wishing to marry you in the next year and starting a family shortly thereafter. <br>  <br>  He deserves to know NOW, like ... right now.<br>  <br>  You have to tell him ... tomorrow. Just say, "John, darling, I've been thinking a lot about my future" (don't say "the future", say "my future"), and since we haven't talked about this too much, I want you to know what my plans are for the next 3-5 years, to see if we are on the same page."

You are simply informing him of what you will be doing, so that he can decide whether he wants to wait for you or not.<br>  <br>  You have NO RIGHT what so ever to tell him to hold on to the ring for now, and asking you again further down the road. If he's ready but you're not, then you're not a match. It doesn't mean one of you is the "bad guy".  You are making a choice, but so is he. His choice is that he wants to find a woman, get married and begin a life to gether. Your choice is to travel around with your family. It is what it is. Sometimes, love alone isn't enough. I wish it was, but it's not. <br>  <br>  You have to be realistic and honest, or you have no chance of a future with this man. He just might wait for you ... but whichever way, you have to tell him.<br>  <br>  Tomorrow. No more game playing.<br>  <br>  Best of luck !!|`|epyTmcOdaa	be honest  with him if your dream is more important than him for you follow your dream but if him....I think love is most important thing in life and it depends on you which thing can give you feeling love.sometimes having someone in life is enough to being happy &sometimes no.tell him your dream mabey you can have both of them.why not.every thing is possible it can help you to know him better|`|lDpibuD2aa	just be happy he prolly won't do anything like that guy who proposed to his gf during halftime in the middle of an NBA pro game and she rejected him in front of the entire audience and ran off the court... so go on youtube watch that and be thankful it will never be televised and in front of 10s of thousands of ppl<br>  worst case in front of some friends|`|RuKK1LYiaa	even if he does propose no one ever said you have to get married right away, just have a long engagement that way you can still do what you have planned and if he truly loves you he'll understand.|`|cCymTwdcaa	If you both have mentioned marriage, you could just as easily mentioned your intentions. To let it get to that point when you have no intention of marrying him in the here and now is leading him on, period. If you care about him, you'll do what is best for him, and that is having an open and frank talk with him.|`|4p9ez6PHaa	Well dating should be entered into with a view to marriage. if you dont think you are ready for that or are to busy maybe dating isnt the thing you should be focusing on either. It would only hurt him more if you keep dating and dont take it seriously.|`|tzDbzR18aa	1. pray that he dusent have an audience if he dus!<br>  2.just tell him how you feel!|`|gTiECIVuaa	If it is truly just that you are not ready RIGHT now, but you could see yourself married to him 'one day', then it sounds to me like you do want marriage, just not quite yet and that you might be feeling a little bit pressured not to marry necessarily, but to marry too quickly. <br>  <br>  If that is the case and you do love this guy but just need some time, then have an honest talk with him about a 'time line'.  You could always become engaged and remain engaged for several years while you do your internships and traveling.<br>  <br>  An engagement period is NOT just the time it takes to plan a wedding.  It is the time in which you have made a commitment to marry and begin focusing in that direction.  It is also a time of getting to know each other.  Most engagements lead to marriage, but once in a while they are broken and the wedding never happens due to a change of heart of one or both partners.<br>  <br>  If however, you really don't want to marry this particular guy, then you owe it to him to tell him how you feel.   <br>  <br>  Of course having only been seeing him for a short period, it also could be you're not positive one way or the other and are 'concerned' if you are honest, you might lose him and then realize he was who you wanted.  Ah, the risks of life.  The important thing is to be honest with yourself and with him.<br>  <br>  Like I said, if you do want it...but not now, a long engagement could be easily accomodated.  If he loves you, you should be worth the wait.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|hzcJH7ouaa	Just be honest with him. If he does propose and you are not ready, let him know the reasons why, and that it isn't because you don't want to get married, but rather your not ready for it, if he loves you he will be understanding of this and respect your decision. On the other hand, if you were to say yes, just because you get engaged doesn't mean you have to get married right away. You can wait a few years or until you feel the time is right. Assuming both parties can come to a mutual agreement on the matter. <br>  <br>  My boyfriend just proposed to me on valentines day, and I said yes of course. But we aren't going out and getting married right away. We are going to wait a year or two, until we get everything on the straight and narrow.|`|xJdtouK0aa	You could always accept the proposal, but just wait a few years till the wedding. That gives you the extra time. And I  would think that if he was gong to propose that he would talk about it a little bit more. maybe not though. Or the next time you bring the subject up tell him what you think. That you need to wait. Just make sure to tell him that its not his fault. and remember to tell him that you do love him.! Don't want to make him feel sad.
u3joyQfeaa	First I am terribly sorry about your friend!!Well I think you never stopped liking him,at least not completely.I think you may still like him so why dont you go visit him in the hospital and when you see him you may be able to tell if you really like him or not.Umm sorry I dont know what else to tell you.|`|MgMsMExPaa	Go see him and take him some food . That will make him interested in you . Hospital food really sucks. Visit with him and make sure that you call him when you cannot go to see him. He will be impressed.|`|f2fyXyulaa	Of course it's normal!! There's nothing wrong with you starting to crush on him again. It happens...boy I went on and off with a best friend for a long time...at times I even thought that was falling in love with him!! Lol it's normal I promise you.|`|wuuOxWLEaa	well....i am not so good myself with guys...but if you have feelings for him...u should follow your heart! i know i get tired of hearing that all the time but it is the truth! your feelings are totally normal! i had a crush on one of my best friends for years and when he found out we went out and now we have been going out for a year! i felt the way you did too but then i realized that it is completely normal to feel this way!<br>  <br>  sorry if i am not much help!
