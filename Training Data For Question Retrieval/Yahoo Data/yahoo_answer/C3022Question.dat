20090220060932AAq0e7n	Local Businesses;New Zealand;Auckland	Is it just me or is there a really good reason?	I'm finding it really hard to get the job that I want.     I'm a fully qualified/certified bar manager.  I have had 13yrs experience in the industry, worked in numerous places from sports fields to restuarants.   The job that i have at the moment I have been there for 10yrs but I don't get enough hours in the place and I've gone as far as I can go there.   I must admit I have high standards of hygiene and organisation.  Everything has to be done by the book.     I was trained to give excellent customer service, prevent wastage and breakage and keep a clean and tidy bar area.  I have also trained new staff and helped them to acheive their managers certificate.     I have been told that certain places are crying out for bar managers and yet when i apply for the position, they give it to someone else.   Is it because I'm a woman (as they seem to always give the job to a guy) or is it something else?
