Dh0JX2Onaa	Do not give up. Study as much and as best as you can. You have come so far that giving up at this point is a very poor idea./
Dh0JX2Onaa	At this time do not study what you have not as yet learned in class since there is about two months to go. Take AP practice tests and arrange your group to study in the areas that you are weak . Everyone should be involved in at least two groups. One group for an area that he needs, and the second group to be the resource person for the area in which he does well./|`|nB5R7HwSaa	I feel your pain I've just started preparing for my AP US History exam. What I would suggest is for everyone in the group to get a review book. Perhaps even different ones to get the information presented in a several ways. Also, buy/make flashcards with all the important vocab, people, wars, etc. to quiz each other with.<br>  <br>  Good luck! :)|`|LpsnLhVSaa	me too! i bought 2 study books, Barrons and Princeton test prep for ap world history. I have a group of 5 people and every friday we are going to meet up at the public library and study study! Our plan was to split each chapter with people like...each people get a few chapter to review and in the group we can summarize and discuss the main things that happened. Another thing is the vocab and the important people in the book. Do you have a website that you can take practice quizes in? My teacher gave me a site that is from our book and it has 30 question quizes that you can take and get the answers and review it with the group. I've started on the Barrons review and it seems to help pretty well, not in depth as the actual textbook, but it summarizes it very well. Also, make categories like Imperialism, Dictatorship, etc. and gather all those in a time-period. You can also make a timeline(takes forever but its worth it). i have an in class test on monday and tues and i am studying like crazy right now!!

3gdLRGzWaa	A school that doesnt take money from the government
5ajPMlrqaa	I feel your pain, more than you know!!! It seems like if you want to have a job & contribute to society, the government punishes you for it! It's almost like, you'd be better off to not work & go on welfare & become an illegitimate parent! (You'd be eligible for food stamps, Section 8 housing, etc!)<br>  <br>  But you want to do things right, so with a work ethic made of steel...<br>  <br>  1. Consolidate your classes as to minimize your travel. 2 hours each way will eat a hole through your wallet with the gas costs. If your community college offers any online classes, jump on that train! It will save you gas money! Classes will be assigned specific days - some will be MWF only, others will be Tuesday/Thursday only - travel to campus 2 or 3 days only if at all possible. Don't go for just one class!<br>  <br>  2. For most people, some debt is necessary in order to finish college. It isn't pleasant, but understand that your degree is an asset that cannot be foreclosed, destroyed, depreciated, or liquidated. Cars can be repossessed, homes can be foreclosed by the bank, but you keep that education no matter what. You have to pay back the loans no matter what, but educational debt is the smartest kind of debt because it's an asset that will serve you the rest of your life.<br>  <br>  3. Look into co-op programs. Community colleges are big into this - you go to school for a term, then you take off a term to work (for money) in your chosen field. So if you're going for medical stuff, you would co-op in a hospital on your co-op term, earn money, & get experience to put on your resume. It helps you get experience & lines your wallet to pay for the next term of classes.<br>  <br>  4. Buy your textbooks online. Don't ever buy at the on-campus bookstore. If you can't buy online, at least go to an off-campus bookstore. You will save a ton of money if you buy online. I bought once from amazon & was very pleased at the product I received. Just give them plenty of time to ship it, and have the correct book title on hand.<br>  <br>  5. Work smarter, not harder. When you look for summer jobs & jobs during the academic year, really look at how much they pay. An amusement park job might be tempting b/c it's fun, but does it offer tuition reimbursement? Good pay? On-campus jobs at colleges pay peanuts. Don't work on-campus - your average pay will be about minimum wage, maybe slightly higher. Try working part-time somewhere else that will offer you better pay per hour so you'll get the most out of your working hours.<br>  <br>  6. Make the most of your time at school so you can open doors for future scholarships. You say you only have "average smarts" - so use those to the best of your abilities. Strengthen your academic skills, go to the tutoring center, get involved in extra-curriculars, and build good relationships with your professors. By doing these things, you can be a well qualified candidate for scholarships that you'll see later for students that are currently in college. You can go to profs for letters of recommendation because you're doing well in their classes. You can have good marks on your transcripts. You can have a list of sports/clubs that you're in. You can make something out of being average that might turn into $$$.<br>  <br>  Good luck to us both!|`|41fe712a36ecf2746af8f97a562a2794aa	You could delay for a year and work and save up. Not the best option but it might make all the difference about where you'll end up going.|`|9qFBftcpaa	Get a job and save up. Not ideal obviously but it's better than debt from a loan.|`|9ad17317f64f8bb8c54035f89a3929f9aa	not knowing your GPA or SAT/ACT scores...I would say keep applying for those scholarships.  The ones that you didn't get, call them and ask how to make your application stronger for next year.  This way you will get some advice for the other applications.<br>  <br>  Other than scholarship, you will have to look at loans and/or working.  Find a job and take 2 classes this semester.  Some employers offer tuition assistance/reimbursement.  Just DON'T GIVE UP!!  <br>  <br>  Even if you don't get enough scholarship money this semester....keep trying.  The school also has some scholarships and programs....ask around!!|`|9jt6oJPwaa	Student loans seem like the only option, maybe you can rent a room around the college, get into the school work program.  Student loans aren't due until 6 mos after you stop going to school and it's the cheapest loan you can get.  Just make sure you only use the money for tuition and school related expenses.  It sounds like you'll need to work during school, or join the military.|`|9Ty0hrNxaa	<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WoxYwrP-IBs" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WoxYwrP-I...</a><br>  <br>  This short video will teach you step by step how to earn money online.

I don't know what state you live in but in California they have a fee waiver that makes it so you only pay $10 for any amount of units you want at a community college for an entire year.

The fee waiver application saved me $630 so far because units are normally $20 for instate and I have taken 32 units.|`|vNnvpLKBaa	Are you telling me the closest community college is a 2 hour drive?

uEF1FiySaa	I just learned about this in English so...<br>   <br>  Start of with stating how you are a good person and what you have done that makes you seem as a good person.<br>  <br>  The say what you did, but Sugar coat it a little, and don't accuse yourself of very much just say you make a mistake and whatnot.<br>  <br>  Also dont say what you have doneover and over , just keep apoligizing in different ways<br>  <br>  Then try to make people feel sorry foir you by saying, what you condition was or what ever works. But be nice about it.<br>  <br>  And finally make sure you use repatition of key words  or anything that might spark emotion in the person you are writing to., Ex. Sorry, Apologize, God ect.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped a bit and good luck|`|OZizTA8paa	to write an apology letter why don't you first describe how you feel and i am sure if you describe how you feel it will atleast fill half of one page. Then write how you probably are sorry explain maybe why you did it but you never knew you were going to get into this mess. I think that should help. Good luck in witing your paper!!!!|`|ZuE1MlLvaa	Why do you need two pages to say you're sorry?<br>  Just apologize for what you've done and the aggravation you caused the owner of the car, the cops, the courts.<br>    Say it's taught you a lesson and you'll never do it again.<br>    That's all they really want to hear.<br>    Good luck.

RAxSichXaa	Yes it does.  When you have a velocity in any direction an acceleration must be applied to change either speed or direction.  Since velocity is a "vector" quantity it has not only magnitude but also a direction. Acceleration = force/ mass = force/(weight/gravitational constant.

If the college is regionally accredited then all of the programs in that college are regionally accredited.<br>  <br>  There are some programatic accreditors too.  In law, for example, it's the ABA.  That accreditation matters in some fields but in most fields, such as public administration, regional accreditation is more important than anything else.

8qyofB7Zaa	You won't get a piece of paper saying you learned such and such, but if you just want the knowledge, I think you can. I've thought about doing this myself, not just Wikipedia but also some university sites that offer free lectures like MIT CourseWare and perhaps by checking out books and reading them on my own. In principle, university should be better due to class discussions and interaction with other students, but for me I've only had maybe 2 courses that had any kind of discussion (I'm about to graduate this term). Pretty much everything I've had was just lectures, assignments, and exams, and I think I actually learn worse this way compared to studying by myself because of the pressure in doing assignments/studying makes me less interested in the subject. Right now I'm feeling unmotivated by my courses, I just want to get everything over with to get my degree, but I think after I'm done I'm going to learn things on my own. But it's easier to say "I learned X from taking a course" to an employer than learning by yourself because there's no proof you did.|`|d5aa88d2dd913dea61404e5f13a231acaa	University is more than reading.

rqNb6FIraa	Love is an emotion unlike anything else, it fills you up with a feeling like you can't even imagine!|`|iLFYj6Qgaa	Love is a beautiful feeling. I'm sorry for you if you don't know what it is. But be patient, it'll come one day.|`|3S4ci6Traa	Love is as dynamic as the people who share it. As the relationships that birth it.<br>  <br>  Love is as random as the rustling of trees against the wind. As the bird which perches on its branch. As random as the branch that is chosen.<br>  <br>  There are hundreds of factors which go into the being of Love. Although it is shared in different amounts, it has no possible numerical value. I granted the equation of Love being a product of Trust, Promise, and Wish (Love = (Trust^(Wish * Promise)) - (Solitude/Being)), but I forgot all the other possible factors.<br>  <br>  The problem with the simplicity of the above equation was just that, its simplicity.<br>  <br>  Love is in all essences, a simplified, purified emotion. A deep-seeded feeling with hundreds of thousands of factors, but these factors are not always read in the assembling of the product at all times.<br>  <br>  That is the beauty of Love.<br>  <br>  That although it is complex, it is simple in its own way. Just as a flower has hundreds of pedals, a stem, a cluster of seeds, and a complex asexual anatomic structure, it is, in all its infinite complexities, just that: a flower. It is the gift you grant someone, the object you set upon a loved one's grave, or the stem you slip into a crystal vase. It is a product of its complex factors, yet in the end, it is the gift you grant to someone with a meaning all of its own.|`|a3YA2FGfaa	love is when your emotions fill up inside you about someone else or something<br>  love is when..............<br>  that is hard<br>  hey i am a philly girl too!!

tNyapIZDaa	Consider this<br>  <br>  1. Backward planning, backward goal-setting, or backward design. The idea is to start with your ultimate objective, your end goal, and then work backward from there to develop your plan. By starting at the end and looking back, you can mentally prepare yourself for success, map out the specific milestones you need to reach, and identify where in your plan you have to be particularly energetic or creative to achieve the desired results. <br>  <br>  Backward planning, however, is more than reversing the direction of your traditional plan. It's about adopting a different perspective and, perhaps, identifying different milestones as a result<br>  <br>  2. Every night before you sleep, note down all the events or tasks on your hand for the next day like, work/study you want to finish, people you have to meet, important appointments/meetings, shopping etc. that will make you conscious about next day and help you prepare your action plan.<br>  <br>  3. Set goals. Set a precise goal, putting in dates, times and amounts so that you can measure achievement. Set priorities - when you have several goals, give each a priority. This helps you to avoid feeling overwhelmed by too many goals, and helps to direct your attention to the most important ones.<br>  <br>  SMART Goals:<br>  A useful way of making goals more powerful is to use the SMART mnemonic. While there are plenty of variants, SMART usually stands for:<br>  <br>  S - Specific<br>  M - Measurable<br>  A - Attainable<br>  R - Relevant<br>  T - Time-bound<br>  <br>  4. Set goals for and plan each day, each week, each month and each year. Always have these goals/plans on back of your mind - that will keep you conscious.<br>  <br>  5. Keep an eye on the clock all the time and on calendar also.<br>  <br>  6. Start your day early. Don't lounge in bed after your alarm clock goes off: Jump out of bed and start your day. The more time you lie in bed after the alarm clock goes off, the greater the likelihood that the chatter of your mind will say something like, "Stay in bed. Sleep a bit more. The bed is warm. You deserve it.<br>  <br>  Above things could make you fast & efficient.<br>  <br>  7. To be smart - one thing you should be doing, which will only help increase your knowledge, is read. Read, read, read, read, and then read some more. Humans have been writing information down for thousands of years and you should do your best to read as much of it as you can. Reading improves your vocabulary, reading comprehension, knowledge of the world around you, and expands your mind by introducing you to new ideas and points of view.<br>  <br>  8. Lastly, talk less and listen (& think) more. And when you talk, think before you talk (delay 5 seconds before each answer). Remind yourself that you are not learning when you are talking.<br>  <br>  Hope these tips help. Good luck!|`|HGi9XjZ9aa	Well, for example, I practised and practised on the typewriter and now I'm up to 60 mistakes a minute. Pretty good, eh?

Hvcgha72aa	Sometimes you don't need very good vocabuary to be able to write well. As long as you write in a coherent and clear manner which reflects that thought has been given to it, it will help a lot.<br>  <br>  Don't give yourself too much stress about the vocabulary bit. It is usually more important if you are writing about an area which has jargons and technical terms (such as engineering, medicine, etc).<br>  <br>  Remember at the beginning of every paragraph, always give a topic sentence which tells your readers what the paragraph is about. Then you talk about your points, and support them with evidence. End off the paragraph with a conclusion that reinforces the topic sentence.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!

Iwk92vqyaa	No, not a passive way to write, just different.<br>  <br>  It's common, especially in regards folks like Shakespeare and the Biblical canon (of all kinds) to reverse the order of the standard 'noun, verb, object.'<br>  <br>  In this case, the object (specifically the prepositional phrase after the object) in this sentence is at the beginning rather than at the end.<br>  <br>  If it weren't, it would read "God speaks the truth through us." Kinda' boring, eh?<br>  okay...<br>  ...'God' is the noun, 'speaks' is the verb and 'truth' is the actual object of the sentence, but the addition of 'through us' (the prep phrase) details that object - 'the truth.'<br>  <br>  As you have it here, it's not passive, only different and more appealing to many, especially if they are a 'difficult audience' to please.<br>  <br>  You see a lot of that in Shakespeare and in Psalms (KJV) for example.<br>  <br>  The Hebrew language often calls for reversals of 'standard' English when translated, and, in fact, for poetic Hebrew.<br>  <br>  Shakespeare also used such reversals because they were more standard to use in the Elizabethan times.<br>  <br>  And because it often just makes good drama....<br>  <br>  You put the prepositional phrase 'through us' first, when in common English it would be last.<br>  The sentence isn't only active, it's more interesting that way.<br>  <br>  ADD: Comma usage isn't what it has been. Commas aren't seen as much. <br>  <br>  The sentence: "Through us God speaks the truth" (with a period at the end) does NOT call for a pause and it's NOT incorrect if you leave a comma out altogether. <br>  <br>  Again I'll say this - You have a more interesting sentence this way, and to repeat myself, no pause is needed in it. <br>  <br>  Try it outloud and judge for yourself.<br>  <br>  The 2006 Pultizer (think that was the year) was by Cormac McCarthy and he tends to very little, if any, punctuation at all.<br>  <br>  Times change!|`|eIQ5T2amaa	The sentence is legit as long as you place a comma after the beginning phrase: Through us, God speaks the truch. The verb is passive, because it is not performing the action of the sentence. However, the sentence itself is not passive, because the subject (God) is performing the action of the sentence.|`|iLgBqJSWaa	It's not passive, it's just a periodic sentence (the main idea is at the end). It's perfectly legitimate.<br>  <br>  (A passive version might read: "The truth is spoken by God through us.")|`|i2eZXTgkaa	It is passive, but that doesn't make it wrong.  Just don't write a whole essay like that.|`|RoqxGbgRaa	no, it's not wrong. <br>  <br>  and no, it's not passive; it's active because of how your verb is constructed. <br>  <br>   to make this sentence passive, you would have to change it to "through us, the truth is spoken by God."|`|rTltdADcaa	maybe..

f61c6ad75081d1de726d4e9737429211aa	The first thing you need to understand about an argumentative essay, if you want to persuade others to your view, is that you must become an expert on both sides of the argument (for and against).  This means you must do some serious research (reading/study).  <br>  <br>  The person who does the best 'argumentative essay' is the person who knows both sides and can effectively REFUTE the arguments of the other side.  Sometimes you can do this with stories or examples that show the inferiority of the opposite argument.  <br>  <br>  So if, after your reading and study, you decide you can only really argue for one position, be ready and willing to change because of the evidence you have found after you were able to think about it for awhile.  <br>  <br>  Let me give you a example or two.  <br>  1.  "Women soldiers should be able to serve in combat."  So our nation goes to war, and begins to draft civilians to serve in our military.  Does supporting this argument mean you feel women everywhere must now leave their families, just like the men, and obey the draft to fight in the war?<br>  2.  "Library has decided to ban certain books."<br>  So, the library refuses to admit and loan books that demonstrate how to create nuclear bombs and writers who propose treacherous destruction against the US government by terrorism.  Does supporting the quoted argument mean you feel the library must have and loan books on these things?<br>  <br>  The difference in an argumentative essay is YOU.  Your voice needs to be heard in the essay.  <br>  <br>  Do the reading and form your opinion first.  Then you will see how to argue either for or against and know 'which stones are the heaviest'.|`|2bTeIiUYaa	Write an argument against having to write an argumentative essay.|`|MKJAQ2koaa	Topic- Should woman soldiers be able to serve in combat situations<br>  <br>  (opening statement)- yes or no<br>  Example- Yes, woman are just as tough as the men if not tougher, why? because my grandma served in vietnam killing 300 Vietnamese on a confirmed operations post stationed near Saigon etc, bla bla.<br>  <br>  Example- No because woman should stay at home with the kids and (clean house, etc, bla bla.<br>  <br>  (sub topic)-goes with the top a little more info<br>  (sub topic 2) a little more detail about sub topic 1<br>  <br>  (Closing tying it altogether) So for the U.S. to have woman soldiers fight at the front lines yes and 90% of americans think so too.( sir bugs bunny 2009) site. <br>  <br>  (Reference) Woman soldiers p.27. 2006<br>  2nd reference www.woman of war if you site from a web site.<br>  <br>  Piece of cake for somebody like you.<br>  Good Luck.|`|7rp50tUBaa	Ok its simple don't make it too complicated. Usually the argumentative essay is a kind of essay in which you try to tell your audience about your point of view. You give them reasons about why you think your point of view is right and try to convince them about your point of view. Once you think you did that, then you drive to conclusion and tie your argument just like a regular essay. But remember that when writing argumentative essay you will have to list some sort of evidence that proves your point of view. This evidence can be your own experience of something that relates to and prove the point of view. The evidence can also be a fact that everybody or most people are aware off. It can also be authority which means your proving that your point of view is right by listing someone who is famous and this person proves your point of view is right. For instance, You want to convince some basketball players that Jordan sneakers are great, You are going to tell them about michael jordan that he wears this sneaker and he is great so if you were it you will be good. Many or most of them will just believe you because they believe in Michael Jordan as being great. So Michael Jordan is your authority. The last known evidence is own believe or fundamental truth. It's When you have certain believe about something so you just list that belief to be your reason for this point of view. I would not recommend you using own believe because of the fact that your audience (readers) might not believe in it. So you will have to think about if your audience will believe it. But I don't recommend you using this. <br>  <br>  First you will introduce your argument by giving some background information about your topic and at the last sentence you will write your thesis (point of view). Then in each body paragraph you will list your reasons and support them using evidence. Evidence just tells your readers that your capable of proving your point of view to be true. Remember to start your body topic sentence and end it up with what's called wrap up or closure of body( a sentence that ends up your body and related to the topic sentence and thesis). Also in conlusion, you will need to revise your reasons in a summary and give your point of view at the last sentence just like the introduction.<br>  <br>  In your case about the library banning some books. You could use own experience as evidence. You can say that you might need this books in future. That's own experience evidence but its not so good like a fact or authority.  You could say as a fact that every book is helpful in its own way. You know that many people would agree about this fact so you can use it as evidence and so on. But remember that I don't recommend you using own belief or fundamental truth first. if thats the only one you can use then use it but if not, don't use it. Because your audience might not agree with your belief and therefore you missed up your whole argument.<br>  <br>  <br>  If you really will use argumentative essay a lot in future, I would recommend you buying the book " The informed argument " seventh edition by Rober K.Miller. I'm using it in my college to write argumentative essays and trust me, Its great book and clear and easy to understand.<br>  <br>  <br>  If you have any more questions, feel free to ask and it will be my pleasure to answer you.

8oCwrIR2aa	First, you have to realize this exercise is not interested in a factual analysis of the situation and what the answers should be in light of such.<br>  <br>  It is solely interested in you looking at the exact pieces of material offered and being answered from that perspective.<br>  <br>  Second, because it has no actual factual basis, but just the basis of assuming the material offered is all one needs, almost any answer for the rankings that you can make sound right in the one sentence part at the end is perfectly satisfactory.<br>  <br>  In other words, it's only right or wrong based on how well your sentence matches your rankings. So you should read the given material and form an opinion on how important each piece is to you and then rank them. AFTER ranking them, based on some thinking about your reactions to them all, THEN figure out a sentence that is consistent with those rankings.<br>  <br>  Personally, I cannot give a real answer to this question with just these given bits of garbage, er, material. Clearly the author of the exercise has left facts and reality behind in his wandering into a fantasy world. I doubt he thinks America did anything right ever, including fighting for four years to end slavery. The Japanese were teaching 4yo children how to attack the American forces that would hit the beaches. Attack them with sticks. Teaching them how to select sticks rather than just picking up any old stick. Their military's decision was that all 100,000,000 Japanese must die rather than that they themselves should admit failure by surrendering. We killed perhaps 300,000 people between the two cities and bombs and saved 99,700,000 others. If your grandfathers had slaughtered 100,000,000 Japanese including all the women and children, how would your life have been scarred by the knowledge that America's "greatest generation" had done such a thing? I ask because the last thing to rank is "future generations" — you and I here in America, and any Japanese person who lived past the end of the war or was born afterwards.<br>  <br>  But, I'll pretend.<br>  <br>  Given the given material, I think the author of the exercise expects rankings along these lines:<br>  <br>  3    Japanese civilian<br>  7    American allies<br>  5    American soldier<br>  4    American scientist<br>  2    Pentagon officials<br>  6    State Department<br>  1    Future generations<br>  <br>  Once the war itself was over, how could Truman ever expect future generations to not learn how the military leaders already winning the war and the very scientists who designed and built the weapons felt they should never be used past threats and so, how could he ever expect those future generations to not cry, and feel their souls die, with the voices of the few survivors to live long enough to leave their experience to live past them?<br>  <br>  The simple truth though is that an incredibly horrifying experience awaited both sides without the bombs. Those military officials all knew what lay ahead and wrote what they did to avoid being pilloried after the war. There was only one military leader who did the least little thing to keep the Bomb from being anything other than a military weapon: General Marshall. He refused to allow pieces parts for more than three bombs to be taken close enough to drop on Japan. All the other pieces parts were kept in the US (we had parts enough for twelve bombs total when they began moving them forward; the bombs were too big and too delicate to be assembled in the US and moved forward whole). This meant he limited the number of them that could be dropped before Japan had time to internalize their import to three. The rest would have taken six weeks to bring forward, assemble, and have ready to use. So his action meant no one could have in mind dropping one a day without giving them time to think and surrender.<br>  <br>  Not a single other leader or scientist did anything but cover his *ss. For posterity. Cover your posterior for posterity.<br>  <br>  One last aside: the Japanese military still wouldn't surrender. The Emperor made two tapes for radio broadcast telling his nation he desired to surrender hoping that one of them could be smuggled out of the palace. One WAS intercepted. Only his making of two of them kept their military from continuing on.<br>  <br>  64 years later we are still using the Purple Heart medals we bought for the invasion of the Home Islands. Not even halfway used up and that covers Korea, Vietnam, Iraq a couple times, and a host of smaller operations in between. The batch we bought solely for that invasion. Not even half used 64 years later.<br>  <br>  If we hadn't dropped the Bombs, we wouldn't have Pokemon! Future generations would be the poorer.

Sometimes you can trick yourself into sounding confident that way.<br>  <br>  As for your debate, you could consider looking at Thomas More's Utopia.

The word love can refer to a variety of different feelings, states, and attitudes, ranging from generic pleasure to intense interpersonal attraction. The word love is both a verb and a noun. Love is not a single feeling but an emotion built from two or more feelings. Anything vital to us creates more than one feeling, and we also have feelings about our feelings (and thoughts about our feelings)[1]. This diversity of uses and meanings, combined with the complexity of the feelings involved, makes love unusually difficult to consistently define, even compared to other emotional states.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  OR <br>  <br>  just means you care about someone ALOT.|`|nkLzaCm1aa	love is not sex. you do not have to love someone to have sex with them, for example porn stars. love is a deep emotional feeling that you have for someone or something.|`|6QyBWV94aa	love is something that extends you beyond yourself !! to connect with another being ..<br>  <br>  for e.g. one can love their pet.. my roommate's cat has been mowing and sad since my roommate has gone on this trip..she really misses her !! thats one kind of Love ..|`|nxXYuTiMaa	Love is when someone becomes the most impotent thing in your life.|`|PHKayk0oaa	totally wrong.!<br>   only bad egg will say that<br>  <br>  love for me is undefinably
IWSc7xkiaa	I don't really love my job, but I guess I don't hate it. Honestly, sometimes it just depends on the day.<br>  <br>  Although English is an extremely important class, most students hate it and will argue that it is not applicable to their current lives or futures. There isn't much you can say to actually change that.<br>  <br>  State testing is becoming a nightmare. In NC our English I students must pass the state EOC, which pretty much means we teach ONLY the test. Sadly, when they get to the next level of English they are not prepared for it.<br>  <br>  Many students hate to write, which is a major part of the English curriculum. This becomes a problem when we try to teach them to do it correctly. <br>  <br>  Many students hate to read, so this time often leads to discipline problems such as sleeping, texting, talking, note writing, or just acting out.<br>  <br>  The money is pathetic.<br>  <br>  However, I do get a great feeling when my students say, "Hey! I really liked that book!" or "That was the first  book I have read all the way though" or even "Okay, prepositions make sense now." I guess the problem for me is that these moments just don't happen all that often.<br>  <br>  If I were you I would go into psychology, but clearly you have to decide what is best for you. Good luck!

You can even apply with a music degree if you want!!! <br>  <br>  Courses recomended for medicine: <br>  <br>  - biology, chemistry, physics, english, and mathimatics (in order of importance) - these will help you prepare for your MCAT and also for the information that will be taught in Med School. <br>  <br>  these coureses are intended to help you to do better on the MCAT and in Med School, and are not necisarily required for medical school application. <br>  <br>  You should use common sense - e.g. it is better to take a course in anatomy or physiology than in marine biology. Aim your courses towards understanding the human body, <br>  <br>  Then also consider Chemistry, Physics, Calculus, and engish becuase these are the things on the MCAT. <br>  <br>  hope this helps, best of luck!!!|`|JpDLQBitaa	Take a look at the link below it will really help you, and also you can major in any subject but it is recammended that you major in a science(biology,chem,physics)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://74.125.95.132/search?q=cache:cuJaDKlfsKEJ:uic.edu/depts/mcam/hcoe/documents/THEROADTOBECOMINGADOCTOR.pdf+university+of+chicago+the+road+to+becoming+a+doctor&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=2&gl=us" rel="nofollow">http://74.125.95.132/search?q=cache:cuJa...</a>|`|AA10952792	biology, with the pre-med option.|`|TqS3vGXFaa	you can major in anything you want as long as you meet the requirements for med school.

FmYkUfIDaa	Hi Lilliana,<br>  Here is a Web Definition:<br>  An electrical circuit is a closed loop formed by a power source, wires, a fuse, a load, and a switch. When the switch is turned on, the electrical circuit is complete and current flows from the negative terminal of the power source, through the wire to the load, to the positive terminal. Any device that consumes the energy flowing through a circuit and converts that energy into work is called a load. A light bulb is one example of a load. It consumes the electricity from a circuit and converts it into work — heat and light.<br>  <br>  Because this is a technical explanation you may have difficulty understanding it, so I will try to use a simpler explanation.<br>  <br>  Imagine a table lamp on your study desk. It is connected by two wires to a wall mounted power socket. Near the lamp a switch is located. A Globe/bulb is fitted inside the lamp shade.<br>  <br>  When the switch is in the 'Off' position the electrical circuit is 'open' and the lamp remains 'Off.'<br>  <br>  When the switch is in the 'On' position the electrical circuit is 'closed' and the lamp lights because the electrical circuit is complete.<br>  <br>  Illuminating I hope.

Every high school weights classes differently - or not at all - which is why the weight doesn't count outside of your high school.  Colleges ask for unweighted grades.

You can get a bachelors in education at most state schools, or major in the field you want to teach (if for high school).

owDSIWYwaa	If you are referring to spanking as corporal punishment, then all you have to do is work with children for an extended time (year or so) on a daily basis to see that sometimes it is necessary.  Ok, let's say we don't spank for anything.  Not when a child hurts another child.  Not when a child shows complete disrespect, or even when a child can not tell the difference between a lie and the truth. Not when a child destroys the things of others with no care of the feelings of others.  Let's just tell them "Mommy said no."  and see how they turn out.  What kind of adult will you get?  One who does not see why it is wrong to harm another person.  You get an adult who can not hold down a job because they have never learned to respect others.  One who does not understand anything about loyalty or trust because they have never been taught the difference. Basically another unhappy unproductive dangerous member of society.  <br>  There are a few exceptions.  There are children whose temperament is meek and hate to be scolded, but most of them are strong willed and need to be spanked every once in a while.|`|J6Ksn0P7aa	At school?

krHIiK85aa	When adding and subtracting decimals, your daughter should make sure she lines up the decimal points and changes the whole number to a decimal.  The whole-number decimal should have the same number of digits after the decimal point as the other number.  For instance 0.35 has two decimal places, so 35 should be rewritten as a decimal with two place-holding zeros: 35.00.<br>  <br>  Now she can write the problem to make it easier to solve by lining up the decimal places:<br>  <br>                                 35.00<br>                                 00.35<br>                                ---------<br>                                 34.65<br>  <br>  Lots of kids have problems learning this skill.  They forget to turn the whole number into a decimal with place-holding zerios.  Or they forget to line up the numbers so the decimal points are exactly one under the other.|`|p5uXXi54aa	This way of phrasing a subtraction problem confuses kids sometimes because they can't tell which number to put first...I tell my daughter to use the word "from" to find the number that goes first in the subtraction problem. Your example is "What is 0.35 "from" 35?" The number that comes after the word "from"  (35) is the first number in the subtraction problem...so the problem is written 35 - 0.35.  Remember to pin a decimal on the end of the number without one so that you can line up the decimals correctly when you subtract. (35.0 - 0.35)<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|ispD8O8paa	as in 35-0.35?

If you don't feel like you got fulfillment with them because one or both were absent in your life, then you might go someplace else to fulfill your education in social behavior. <br>  <br>  This isn't always a good thing.

As one of the answers to their questions, i told a story and tied it in to their question.<br>  <br>  So if you can be a creative writer, you can start off like you would when writing a short story. You can start the essay in detail about a personal experience. Maybe you went through a rough time, an experience that made you stronger, etc. You can also write about something you do on an every day basis. Maybe a moment when you learned an important life lesson, a moment during a sports game (if you are an athlete), or just a competition in general.<br>  <br>  I assume colleges get bored with the people who list off their achievements and such. Thats what the application is for. Use this personal statement to really tell them who you are as a person, not just what you are as an academic achiever. <br>  <br>  good luck
nWLrNI0faa	I don't know where you are (and you don't have to tell me) but I would look into schools in your state (in-state tuition is soooo much cheaper) which offer majors in some of the following areas:<br>  <br>  1.  Non-profit administration/management<br>  2.  Public administration<br>  3.  International Development or International Relations<br>  4.  Social Change (believe it or not, there are some majors called that)<br>  5.  Social Responsibility/Corporate Social Responsibility or something that sounds like that.<br>  <br>  I think you should also consider:<br>  5.  Journalism<br>  6.  Sociology<br>  7.  Anthropology<br>  8.  Education<br>  9.  Law<br>  10.  Healthcare<br>  <br>  Essentially, whatever program you pick, I recommend taking a variety of courses to give you a broader experience....management and accounting courses would be useful...consider taking some electives in philosophy or humanities if they are not part of your core classes.<br>  <br>  Include in your education at least one internship with a non-profit or social service agency (could be governmental or not). <br>  <br>  I'd like to emphasize minoring in something like management, if your major doesn't include those courses.  This will be very useful to you in your career.<br>  <br>  Before, during a break, or after your education, consider taking a "paid volunteer" position with the Peace Corps or an AmeriCorps program such as the National Civilian Community Corps or City Year.  These will give you a lot of experience in the area you're interested in and look nice on a resume, as long as you are willing to explain the organizations to prospective employers.|`|RRTDRSw1aa	join marines and become a recon specialist. go to some university with wrestling, boxing or, maybe, football and major in physical education. that will prepare you.|`|RxNLUCxdaa	<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMTj2Zt5fHo" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMTj2Zt5f...</a><br>  <br>  here, look university of davenport, awesome program

If your grades are good and you've been involved with extracurricular and community service, you will qualify for at least a few scholarships.<br>  <br>  Loans can help bridge the gap between what you get in scholarship and the full cost of school. If you are going to college in the fall of this year, you want to fill out the FAFSA now! That's the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, and it's available at <a href="http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/" rel="nofollow">http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/</a><br>  <br>  The FAFSA will determine if you qualify for any federal grants, and your state may also use it for this, as well. Some colleges require it as a part of their own financial aid process (mine did). The FAFSA will also determine your eligibility for federal student loans, which are almost always better than ones from private companies. If you get loans, make sure you get as much of it in federal loans as you possibly can before you turn to any private companies.<br>  <br>  Federal loans may or may not cover all of your tuition and other costs (room and board if you live on campus, textbooks, etc.), that depends on the outcome of your FAFSA. If it you can't get enough in federal loans, you will either have to seek out more scholarships, get private student loans, or choose a cheaper school. <br>  <br>  It may seem like a smart idea to go to the most expensive school that will accept you, and to get loans to make up the difference, but there is definitely such a thing as "too much student debt." Look up the starting salaries for the jobs you think you'll want after college, and use this calculator to figure out how much is appropriate in student loans for those jobs: <a href="http://www.finaid.org/calculators/scripts/loanpayments.cgi" rel="nofollow">http://www.finaid.org/calculators/script...</a><br>  <br>  If you're not going to college this fall, but later on, keep all of this in mind, and fill out the FAFSA as early as possible the year you want to start college. So for the 2010-2011 school year, you will want to fill out the FAFSA as early in 2010 as possible.|`|H9OFtkeoaa	You have to fill out a FASA.  Don't wait for the tax forms to be filled out.  Do the FASA early based on estimated income.  You will need your parents income info if your are living with them.  The college will base your loans and grants on their income and they will be expected to pay a certain amount.  See you school guidance counselor.  If you are a senior you should have your FASA completed and have been applying to colleges since November.  If you have not started then hurry.  You won't know how much money you can get until you are accepted and talk with the college financial aid office.

gb9REJN4aa	Most schools will consider it an incomplete application if you don't include an undergraduate transcript. You can try and then just see what they say, but I suspect many places will just toss your app aside (same as if you didn't write one of the essays or pay the application fee).<br>  <br>  I'd recommend you send both your undergraduate and your MFA transcripts, and maybe also a brief statement about how you've grown and matured in the last few years (as is evident by your shiny new better grades) or about how your were made for English and not whatever your undergraduate field is.<br>  <br>  But you can always try sending just one and see what happens. I do warn you, though, that people will DEFINITELY notice the lack.
OHxjj9akaa	Since the government pays out billions in financial aid each year, they want to make sure the parents have taken the responsibility to pay for college first if they can.  That way the aid goes to the truly needy.  Its not a perfect system but with few exceptions, (the student being married, a grad student, a ward of the state), it is the parent's responsibility up until the student reaches 24.  (The age limit was set at 24, to prevent students from waiting a year or two to start college to get around the rule).<br>  <br>  I've found some good information here...<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.FinancialAidQuick.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.FinancialAidQuick.com/</a><br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|H9OFtkeoaa	I guess the most direct answer is the people with the money make the rules.

I have written several times because my children had to use my income but I am not paying back their loans. TERRIBLE SYSTEM|`|DorePwVOaa	It has to do with the push and pull between the Department of Education and families of students. The DoE wants to only give financial aid to students that really, really need it, and families want to get as much aid as possible for their student. Obviously, those are completely opposite goals.<br>  <br>  If children were considered independent as soon as they turned 18, the DoE would have no way of telling which students were going to have their education paid for by parents, and which were not. Everyone would apply for aid and claim that their parents aren't helping at all, if they could! To combat people lying like that, the DoE makes it really hard for young students (under 24 years old) to claim that they are independent. They really have to prove that they are independent.<br>  <br>  Basically, they assume that over the first 18 or so years of a child's life, the parents have been preparing to send that kid to college. In their eyes, it is the parents' responsibility to pay for their child's education. <br>  <br>  Taxes are a completely separate process, and independence on them has no bearing on financial aid, and visa versa. I encountered this last year when I filed independent on my taxes, but not my FAFSA.|`|QFf9phAmaa	so that genunion one can get aid.

iE2sDxDAaa	You're grade say you're doing fine. You're learning what your suppose to, and that's what matters.<br>  <br>  Using big words doesn't mean anything aside from showing you have a large vocabulary. Trust me, your vocabulary will expand the longer your in school, and even after school. To me, it's one of those things that comes with experience and lots of reading. Don't put yourself down because they sounds smarter. No real person uses "big words" when they talk unless they are trying to sound smart... which usually means they aren't.|`|on5NQxhkaa	I don't know girl.

ImQPqxEgaa	I has to do a short presentation on the same topic. I used four of this writer's ideas since they really applied to the area we were studying more than the others.<br>  <br>  It is called, 'Eight Tips for International Business'<br>  <br>  1-Lose your tunnel vision. This is step No. 1 in taking your business across borders. Forget the misconception that conditions around the world are just as they are in the United States — or should be. They aren't, and they never will be. The sooner you embrace that essential truth, the faster you'll latch on to other salient issues for doing business overseas. <br>  <br>  2-Get to know the culture. Someone once said that it's an incredible faux pas to offer a Japanese executive your business card without first turning it around so that he or she can read it right away. That detail illustrates the importance of understanding the traditions and nuances of the cultures with which you wish to do business. Check out Web sites that discuss various cultures; if possible, talk with businesspeople from foreign countries to gain a sense of appropriate business practices. Is a handshake sufficient to close a deal? Is bribery an accepted element of business leverage? “I once spent an entire summer in Europe asking waiter after waiter when I was going to get some ice in my water,” says Richelle Shaw, chief operating officer of workz.com and an authority on developing business overseas. “We think the ways of America are the ways of the world, and they're simply not.” <br>  <br>  3-One size does not fit all. Granted, barriers are breaking down worldwide, but that still doesn't mean that one product will work in every situation. Expensive, proprietary software likely will not command the attention of a developing third-world nation that it would in Western Europe. Part of getting to know a country's traditions and culture is understanding interest and demand. That, in turn, can help better direct marketing and other sales efforts. <br>  <br>  4-What price is right? Likewise, it's essential to understand what pricing structure is going to be attractive — but nonetheless profitable for you — in various parts of the world. Again, less developed nations may not be suitable if a product or service is too expensive. By the same token, more affluent cultures may be able to obtain like products less expensively than you can offer. This can really be an overwhelming task, one that often happens through trial and error. “It's usually a good idea to start prices a little bit high and then come down if need be,” Shaw says. <br>  <br>  5-How are you going to ship your product and at what cost? Depending on where you want your wares to go, it's essential to gain a realistic grasp of prospective shipping costs (likely more than you think). Equally important is establishing who's going to pay that bill. If you're setting up an international network, make certain you negotiate whether you or your customers will be covering shipping (or, by contrast, if you can share costs). “The European Union has that Value Added Tax that always adds to the cost of goods,” Shaw says. “You should also pay attention to the culture of the country in which you're doing business. That may dictate who should pay shipping.” <br>  <br>  <br>  6-How will you get paid? Credit card use is far less common internationally than it is within the United States. Give just consideration how you're going to set up a reliable payment structure. Look into wire transfer systems or, if you're doing business on the Internet, online payment programs (it's a way of getting what's owed you, and many also offer currency exchange features). <br>  <br>  7-Consider language differences. If you operate a small business on an international scale, not everyone who stops by your Web site is going to speak English. That means another salient issue is making sure your site content also offers services in a sufficient number of languages. On top of that, recognize that the time will come that an overseas customer, like his or her American counterpart, will want to speak with a living customer rep. So don't overlook staffing, or having access to, bilingual customer-service personnel. <br>  <br>  8-Pay attention to politics. Lastly, never overlook the political environment — or even worse, the threat of terrorism — in areas where you hope to do business. That's particularly true if you're planning on siting a warehouse or some other facility overseas. Make certain you gauge the economic and social stability of prospective markets, not merely to protect any resources that happen to be located there but also to ensure that any goods shipped will, in fact, arrive at their intended destination. Also, make sure you are dealing with a country that is receptive to products from the United States. But, adds Shaw, don't let attention wilt into fear. “If you're an entrepreneur, you're a risk taker,” Shaw says. “Don't let politics deter you completely. That's especially true if you're selling on the Web — anyone can access you there. Always ke

krHIiK85aa	There are several free sites that can help you learn algebra.  I describe them and provide links on my post, K-12 Top 12 Math Homework Help Websites.  For algebra, take a look at #3 MathTV.com, #4 CoolMath.com, #6 Visual Math Learning, and #12 SOS Math.  Each takes a slightly different approach to explaining the concepts.  And SOS Math provides some good practice.  Lots of kids like MathTV which provides a video explaining each type of problem:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.squidoo.com/k12interactivemath" rel="nofollow">http://www.squidoo.com/k12interactivemat...</a><br>  <br>  The Math Dude is a video series from a high school math teacher who provides explanations for algebra concepts to middle and high school students.

5zhAdR1raa	Speaking as a parent - I think you should do the following. <br>  <br>  Research thoroughly - and that does not mean asking a question on Yahoo Answers! - how the ROTC programs work. Go on the web to the Air Force website, talk to a recruiter, BUT, unless you want to start receiving mail, phone calls and emails on a regular basis, do not give any identity info! They may pressure you, but just tell them you have questions, and if they say they can't give info without it, call their bluff. They need you more than you need them. <br>  <br>  Get answers about what you are obligated for, what happens if you change your mind half way through the program, what the requirements are, what the restrictions are - do you have full choice of a major, or do they control that somewhat?<br>  <br>  Exactly how much money do you get? Will you have your choice of schools?<br>  <br>  Then, once you have all this info together, find a time when your family is relaxed, perhaps at a meal, or some evening, but don't bring it up just as your parents walk in the door, or when you can tell they are stressed out over something or arguing. Discuss it in a mature manner, don't roll your eyes at their questions, if you can't answer something they ask, say you don't know but can find out. Remain calm, even if they seem to be objecting. That will show them how important this is to you.You have time to work on them, to soften their resolve should they be opposed.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps!

0E0OaibEaa	Take care of your body. It's the only place you have to live. Jim Rohn<br>  <br>  Exercise to live. Never live to exercise. Jack LaLane.<br>  <br>  Physical fitness is not only one of the most important keys to a healthy body, it is the basis of dynamic and creative intellectual activity. John F. Kennedy.<br>  <br>  The higher your energy level, the more efficient your body. The more efficient your body, the better you feel and the more you will use your talent to produce outstanding results.

Lord Percival.<br>  <br>  True enjoyment comes from activity of the mind and exercise of the body; the two are ever united. Humboldt<br>  <br>  Take care of your body with steadfast fidelity. The soul must see through these eyes alone, and if they are dim, the whole world is clouded. Goethe<br>  <br>  If I'd known I was going to live this long, I'd have taken better care of myself. Eubie Blake (On his 100th Birthday)<br>  <br>  If you don't do what's best for your body, you're the one who comes up on the short end. Julius Erving<br>  <br>  "A man too busy to take care of his health is like <br>  a mechanic too busy to take care of his tools." Spanish Proverb<br>  <br>  "It is amazing how much crisper the general experience of life becomes when your body is given a chance to develop a little strength." Frank Duff<br>  <br>  "The body can be a source of wealth train it right for your health." Jerry Brundies<br>  <br>  "If you have health, you probably will be happy, and if you have health and happiness, you have all the wealth you need, even if it is not all you want." Elbert Hubbard<br>  <br>  "The more severe the pain or illness, the more severe will be the necessary changes. These may involve breaking bad habits, or acquiring some new and better ones." Peter McWilliams<br>  <br>  As a father, my first priority is to help my sons set and attain personal goals so they will develop self-confidence and individual strength.

Ingvar Kamprad, the founder of IKEA and the fourth wealthiest person in the world, dropped out of high school because of his dyslexia and bought the first store at seventeen; you don't become a self-made billionaire if you aren't a very bright bulb. <br>  <br>  I think you attend college to acquire knowledge, skills, and experience and make connections, and your degree is evidence of your work and dedication. It is proof of intelligence to an extent because you would have needed passing grades in order to obtain it, but people can also prove themselves to be smart without an education by excelling in the "real world," such as the men listed above and many, many others. Angelina Jolie and Madonna are very smart woman and neither have a college degree. <br>  <br>  It's true that when you're smart you don't have to prove it, because you are your own evidence. People will realize your intelligence when they're talking with you and from the work you produce, and there's no reason to wave a degree around or flash your credentials except in circumstances like job interviews.<br>  <br>  But what do I know? I'm just heading off to some school Berkley people have described as being second-rate. : )<br>  <br>  ~ Pax / Peace|`|Saul1Bhuaa	No.  College degrees don't prove a person is smart.  They prove that of all the smart people out there, they are willing to commit to a process, and see it through.|`|dN8qDAPSaa	<a href="http://answerall.kickme.to" rel="nofollow">http://answerall.kickme.to</a><br>  A very informative website, kindly stay a minute in website and enter you email address for getting your answer.
AA10297143	I doubt it unless they told me because I don't assume smiling at me or answering a lot of questions or puppy eyes automatically means there is an attraction to me.  I have female students that I know like me but for what I bring to their education, not because they fantasize what is underneath my clothes.  If any of them have that fantasy, they have kept it well hidden and again, I don't go looking for that.|`|YcCquky4aa	i would say they prob do tbh. i mean my mate used to have a crazy crush on our teacher....she followed him outside and stuff, blocked the corrider so he would have to talk to her, go to his revision lessons WHEN IT WAS JUST HER GOING|`|0011Smdtaa	Most teachers would think " that girl enjoys her maths."  It is so great to have a happy student that smiles at you when you are teaching...<br>  This teacher is happily married so I don't think he would be thinking you have a crush on him.  All teachers love a OOhh I get this subject smile, it makes you look pretty, intelligent and happy... You sound like a little honey.  KEEP SMILING|`|BddRfJ2caa	I'm not a teacher, but if i was i would think "that girl most really love math". it's ok to crush on a teacher but just as long as you don't make it obvious, you could day dream and all but don't stare at him, you might creep the dude out (jk)|`|3lPL6pVBaa	If you have a crush on your teacher, make it a good thing.  Let it motivate you to work hard on your homework and learn all the material.  Ask questions in class.  <br>  <br>  But be careful not to let it distract you from listening while he's teaching.|`|FkFEsI8Naa	Hi,<br>  I think you should not pay attention to this simple things, If the teacher has married, dont worry about him. But if you can make your habit less not to stimulate the teacher.
QFrbFp4Gaa	It makes sense but it's spelled "enormous", not "enourmous" (even in British spelling).  Also "agony" is just a stronger sense of "pain" so to have "pain" AND "agony" is unnecessary.  I think it would sound better if you said something like "he suffered through tremendous agony".  Just my opinion - as it stands it does make sense in that it's grammatically correct and everything.|`|votSNHgJaa	Yep. Although "enourmous" is better spelled "enormous" and, if that's a sentence, the "H" should be capitalized.|`|faddb3c58c57bc112ff5dec44a742ff8aa	He suffered through excruciating pain and distress.|`|Iwk92vqyaa	Capital 'H' and yeah, it makes sense.

Does it mean anything in your language, or do you just really like the sound of it?  For whom is this name?  Well, I think it sounds unusual, but can also be unique.  I personally would not want to name my kid "Tallula".|`|736b643244aa90aae39e35a48c07b14baa	Sounds a bit like a combination of Taliban and uvula, that's the first thing that comes to mind.

SHNYP6Xpaa	To do this you must understand Stalin's Soviet Union.<br>  <br>  Unless you understand that Animal Farm was a satire on Stalin, and how Napoleon the pig was Stalin and how Snowball was Trotsky and how everything lines up, you're not going to get a good Thesis statement on "the importance of propaganda in a totalitarian society"<br>  <br>  So go research communism.<br>  <br>  Links provided should help get the picture across.|`|oLj0VTX5aa	Well, the political concepts of Animal Farm ring true today, as it did when it was produced.  It has been years since I have read the book or watched the film, but you could compare the role of the big pig who takes over the farm to many dictators of the past, or even recent politicians.  <br>  <br>  The pig used propaganda as a fear tactic to bring all the other animals to his side, slowly, and then to keep them there.  This was predominant in world war II, and is still a predominant factor in modern society - propaganda is a key factor in many political groups.  Essentially - there is one source for everything, the state or controlling factor owns the media outlets, all sources of information and provide everything they need, and the propaganda is necessary to keep the society down, keep them motivated, and keep them from organizing and taking down the main leaders.  <br>  <br>  I suggest you look at the oppression and fear factor in Animal Farm, and either take the obvious approach and compare it to Hitler or you analyze the many obvious points in Animal Farm to point out how propaganda is mightier than the fist, because it makes the fist seem more deadly than it is.  <br>  <br>  It can also be correlated to the struggle between employers and unions/employees - Wal-Mart is a good example.

mjX1Zhjjaa	Globalisation is the process by which all economies worldwide have become interdependent.  Raw materials are shipped from points of origin, generally poor Southern hemisphere countries that produce them to generally moderately poor Northern hemisphere countries with manufacturing facilities and low wages for manufacture into end use products that are shipped to rich countries for consumption.  If you use manufactured products, (electronics, clothing, et cetra) you support the globalised economy,  So to answer how globalised you may have become is to determine how much of the time you use products that are imported and shipped to you from say...China for instance.<br>  <br>  By the way the North hemisphere, Southern hemisphere competition is for some the genesis of the animosity between countries...study some of the Southern hemispheres dictators and socialists that believe the northern rich countries have been stealing their wealth...for instance Hugo Chavez of Venezuela, although they may think it is stealing, the raw materials are rightfully paid for at existing global prices, another type of or example of globalisation.   <br>  <br>  Good luck with your project.|`|faddb3c58c57bc112ff5dec44a742ff8aa	This might give you something to work on. <a href="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/globalised" rel="nofollow">http://www.thefreedictionary.com/globali...</a>|`|8jvsiu8jaa	Think about the clothes you wear.

HxXduL1maa	St Ursula was the daughter of a 5th Century Christian King in Britain. She was a beautiful, intelligent, outgoing and friendly girl. Ursula was a spiritual girl and at an early age had dedicated herself to God and had decided to remain a virgin because of her love of Christ.<br>  <br>  At that time young girls did not choose their own husbands, their parents decided whom they would marry. A powerful pagan king requested of Ursula's father that she would marry his son Ethereus. The pagan king sent ambassadors to Ursula's father offering large sums of money and other promises if the marriage took place. However they added terrible threats of what would happen if the marriage were not to take place. Ursula's father was very afraid for three reasons: he was afraid of the violent reaction of the other king; he didn't think Ursula would agree to marry and; both he and Ursula would prefer a Christian marriage.. <br>  <br>  Much to her father's surprise Ursula, inspired by God agreed to the marriage but only on certain conditions. <br>  <br>  Each king should put at her disposal ten girls. <br>  Each girl was to be accompanied by another thousand girls. <br>  The kings were to provide ships for a journey. <br>  Ursula was to be granted three years to dedicate herself to God. <br>  The young prince was to receive Christian instruction for baptism. <br>  Ursula actually thought the proposal would be withdrawn on these conditions - but no, the king agreed and Ursula's demands were carried out immediately. <br>  <br>  Ursula's father also invited a group of young men to accompany her and young people began arriving from all directions to join the voyage. During the journey Ursula converted all the girls to Christianity and soon they arrived in Cologne, Germany. Here an angel appeared to Ursula and told her that she and all her companions would return to this place and win the crown of martyrdom. <br>  <br>  They moved on to Rome and Pope Cyriacus was delighted to see them since he himself came from Britain and he had many relations among Ursula's travelling companions. That night an angel told the Pope that he too along with Ursula and her companions would gain the crown of martyrdom. In the next few days Pope Cyriacus asked to join Ursula's group. He put another Pope in his place called Ametos. Pope Cyriacus, Ursula and her companions set out to return to Cologne. <br>  <br>  The Huns were afraid that Christianity would become popular and that many people would become Christians. They gathered an army and plotted to kill Ursula and all her companions on their arrival back in Cologne. <br>  <br>  Back in Britain, Etherius who had now become king received a message from an angel that Ursula was on her way back to Cologne with the Pope and her companions and that he should go quickly and join them. He too would become a martyr. Etherius set off for Germany and met Ursula and her companions in Cologne. <br>  <br>  When Ursula and her companions arrived in Cologne they met the Huns who were only interested in women for pleasure. Ursula and her young girls resisted this violation. Julius, leader of the Huns, instructed his army to kill them all, including Etherius and the ex-pope Cyriacus. Julius decided not to kill Ursula as he thought she was so beautiful he wanted to marry her. Ursula firmly refused his proposal because she wanted to keep the promise she had made to God to remain a virgin. Julius was so enraged he threw an arrow towards her, which pierced her heart and killed her. And so Ursula and her companions were martyred in Cologne.<br>  <br>  Angela Merici founded the Ursulines in 1535 in Italy. At that time the story of Ursula was very popular and people would have heard it and prayed to Ursula. Angela was calling young women to live a life of virginity and to be of service to others. She choose Ursula as a role model for herself and her companions and so still today we are known as Ursulines. Just as God called Angela and her companions he still invites women of today to say yes to the call to dedicate their lives to Him in the spirit of St. Angela Merici.|`|S3lvnRwfaa	You could start at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Ursula" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Ursul...</a> and if that's not enough information then check out the external links at the foot of the page to see if you can locate the web site you have in mind.|`|2hJG4XgCaa	hey The legend of Ursula is based on a 4th- or 5th-century inscription from the Church of St. Ursula (on the Ursulaplatz) in Cologne.

AA10911602	One answer gives you most of the information you need. It misses some points:<br>  1) Traineeships may give you a qualification but the income ceiling is low. Some provide TAFE training of one day a week for six months, others are all on the job training.<br>  <br>  2) The income levels at the end are far greater for apprenticeships cf traineeships.|`|JAZnQJPHaa	A traineeship often refers to training on the job at a low VET (Vocational Employment Training)  level, like Certificate 1 or Certificate 2 in Retail etc. If the traineeship is at Certificate 3 level, that is considered under the VET system as "Trade Level". An apprenticeship often goes for 3-4 years, so a person starting with zero training, works up to be a qualified tradesperson, chef etc. by the end of the apprenticeship. (Cert 3-4 level). A traineeship may only offer a few components of what is contained within trade level qualifications.|`|5d8cda11147363f74448679f58829463aa	A trainee-ship is just being taught a job or minor skill from someone else. An apprenticeship is learning a trade skill from a master in that field i.e. A master electrician will take on an apprentice to teach that skill too and another fry cook will train a new trainee on cooking at McDonald's.|`|kEkaTsShaa	an apprenticeship takes longer to do.. thats all i know|`|49e6ec40b0a977433d9564754e2d4b21aa	no diff

Maho3P5kaa	i wouldn't do that, one of my friends in high school did that and it got sooooo infected she was in the ER getting them to take it out. she ended up with stitches in her cartilage because they couldn't get it out. and yes she cleaned it, exactly how they told her to. she was a very clean person so it wasn't anything to do with cleanliness it was the fact of it pulling when she slept that caused an internal infection. it did look good though

ORonhAuvaa	I hate to say this, but there isn't much you can do. However, she can't legally give you a zero if you have an excused absence. She needs to allow you to make up the work.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately students don't have much sway with administration. Your parents are going to have to advocate on your behalf. It is too bad that this teacher is raining on your parade. <br>  <br>  You might want to schedule an appointment with your counselor so you can get some guidance on this issue.|`|Jzv6WyxSaa	If you can't talk to your math teacher, please talk to someone else.  If your parents believe you, hopefully they can take a stand and talk to the teacher.  Otherwise talk with a guidance counselor.  If in unfortunate circumstances that doesn't work, I'd try talking with the school principal.  Not sure what level of schooling you are at, but with all the protesting, there could be a chance at switching classes or teachers.  Just take it to the top, and please, never give up.|`|MXgrlSd0aa	Sorry, it sounds like you sound like you do have a bad teacher.  If you have an excused absence your teacher has to let you make up the work.  Most teachers adore having students who make good grades in their class.  A teacher who has a failing class is  not an effective teacher.  This is a huge red flag waving.  If the majority of students are failing this class, a good principal would intervene.   Seems like she needs to find a different subject or grade to teach.  Ask your friends who are failing to have their parents speak to the principal.|`|aqto0hJTaa	Did you make up your work you missed on the days you were absent?  If not, you should have zeroes for that work.  That's simply policy.<br>  <br>  The other stuff sounds like she has little confidence in herself and you maybe intimidate her a little.<br>  <br>  Is she new?

8ZNd4CYUaa	It is possible to change however u should have all ur first sem exams cleared
gb9REJN4aa	I'm gonna disagree with the others, I think, because I really do believe that any normally intelligent person willing to work hard CAN take AP classes and be very successful in them. If you have a learning disability that is another matter. If you are just normally intelligent, however, then AP classes can be a LOT of work, but will be good for you. What I have seen is that people tend to get about the same grades no matter what classes they're in--so if you're a B student now, you'll probably be a B (or maybe B-) student in your AP classes, too. The one exception is math classes: AP math classes move much quicker than non-AP classes, and if you fall behind one week, then you get lost for the rest of the year. If math is your strength, then go for it; if math is not your strength, then maybe keep out of the AP math classes.<br>  <br>  The learning environment of an AP class is much more intense than in a non-AP class. You will do a lot of writing, if it is an English or History class, and a lot of experiments if it is a science class. You'll really be expected to know things by the time you get out. It will be hard--so you might ask yourself whether or not you want to take them.<br>  <br>  Don't ask yourself if you can take them, though. I went to an unusual public high school where every single kid had to take and pass at least four AP exams. Most of the students there were not "gifted" or super-intelligent--and almost everybody passed those exams. So a normal person working hard in a class that expects the best of you really can do it.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|ivkGknUsaa	Make sure to do well in regular classes first because if you don't, there's no way they'll allow you to take any AP class. Okay, just like what some had mentioned, you're not dumb. If you are dedicated and you really want to pass an AP class, you'll be able to do it. Being mentally gifted isn't the only way it's possible. Some people succeed just by working hard.<br>  <br>  AP classes discuss topics way faster than regular classes. <br>  Some topics are also discussed in a more comprehensive and rigorous way.|`|DT4PHmukaa	First of all, your brain is not slow and dumb. You should never insult yourself. Second of all, if you have taken regular classes and haven't done so well it is not a good idea to enroll in AP courses. That question is best answered by a teacher or a school counselor who is familiar with your courses and grades. Lastly, there is nothing wrong with taking regular courses. This dosen't mean you're slow or dumb or any other insulting idea you or other people may say or think. In AP you are definetely on an advanced track of learning- a higher than average level but there is nothing wrong with being average.|`|JTjL9eD7aa	AP classes are geared for those who are intelligent, not average... regardless of how dedicated you are to your schoolwork, it is most certainly not a good idea to enroll in AP classes if you do not have the mental capacity to do so. Classmates won't appreciate you slowing them down, teachers will be frustrated knowing you should be in regular classes and you will end up realizing you should have stuck to regular classes. In those, you might even be able to excel and get really good grades! In AP classes, you will probably get near-failing grades, regardless of how much you try, because the material will just be too advanced for you. I was in AP classes all throughout high-school and was incredibly insulted when someone half as intelligent as I would attempt to enroll in an AP class... we all felt this way. AP classes are to be taken seriously, just as varsity sports or club officer positions are. Just as you wouldn't try out for the girls' varsity basketball team when you are a really shitty basketball player, you shouldn't attempt AP classes without the mental capacity to do so.<br>  <br>  Surely, people will tell you that you can do it... anyone can if he or she really tries! That, however, is not truthful and does not parallel reality. What I have said is not mean; it is true. And, honey, I do wish you the best of luck in school. It's just awful how dishonestly kind people are these days... some do not realize that by giving someone false hope and trying desperately not to insult someone, they are actually hurting that someone. There is more to life than puppies and flowers... it's time for people to be real about things that are unfortunate but cannot be changed.
eQUaCejIaa	To be able to teach in Japan, you require a bachelor's degree of some kind before you can even be considered. Once you have that under your belt, I would serious consider applying for the JET (Japanese Exchange and Teaching) Programme. It is a safe, relatively easy way to make it to Japan. After you have finished a year with them, you can either recontract up to five years, or you can go off and try and make it on your own. <br>  <br>  If you have any other questions about JET, or Japan, feel free to e-mail me any time.
EvyY3dUNaa	absolutely it is....A simile is a figure of speech comparing two unlike things, often introduced with the word "like" or "as".[1] Even though similes and metaphors are both forms of comparison, similes allow the two ideas to remain distinct in spite of their similarities, whereas metaphors seek to equate two ideas despite their differences.|`|mtyhSPi9aa	YUP<br>  <br>  a simile is any verse ..

fAcVndo7aa	1.  The phrase "I have meant to..." isn't used very much.  English speakers usually say "I meant to..." (at least, American English speakers - I am very well aware that English and American English differ greatly, so no offense to any British answerers).  It is sometimes used in the negative ("I haven't meant to insult you").  You often see "I have been meaning to..." used.  As in:<br>  I have been meaning to call her.<br>  I have been meaning to pick up some bread at the store.<br>  But for an example, I would say:<br>  I've meant to tell you that I'm allergic to your dog.<br>  I've meant to stop by and see her, but I've been very busy.<br>  <br>  2.  I've forgotten to...<br>  ...call my mother.<br>  ...buy stamps at the post office.<br>  ...mail my letter to Grandma.<br>  This one is much, much easier.|`|vEBfp8yHaa	I've forgotten to water the plants!|`|GuQ8Gg6saa	I've meant to clean the kitchen.<br>  <br>  I've forgotten to do it.

d36OrpbDaa	in a way, finding it disgusting as a way of life - beyond the sex part, but the love relationship between two people of the same sex - then technically it's a discriminatory belief, because it's only finding love/sex relationships disgusting if they're both the same sex.<br>  <br>  it depends on your definitition of discrimination.  to discriminate can mean "to choose between."  it's not always a bad thing (like, to discriminate between two good choices... not a popular usage of the term, but technically correct).<br>  <br>  everyone has prejudices (judgments of things before they really know or understand them), but at different levels and toward different things.  some are worse than others.<br>  <br>  i think it's still prejudiced.  but as long as you aren't harming them, as long as you don't disrespect them or take away their rights, then it's better than what it could be. not that it's great though.  but you do have a right to your opinions, even if others (including myself) don't always agree with them.<br>  <br>  as for me, i find that anyone else's relationship grosses me out if i have to see them kiss or whatever. straight or gay.  but i don't find homosexuality in and of itself particularly disgusting.  to each their own.|`|uLlwcUbsaa	No I would just think you find it repulsive for yourself.|`|1505a95e660275609c4bb43c388cdf1aaa	Is that your picture?

See waive.]<br>  <br>  Investment Dictionary: Waiver <br>  <br>  The voluntary action of a person or party that removes that person's or party's right or particular ability in an agreement. The waiver can either be in written form or some form of action. A waiver essentially removes a real or potential liability for the other party in the agreement.<br>  <br>  Investopedia Says:<br>  For example, in a settlement between two parties, one party might, by means of a waiver, relinquish its right to pursue any further legal action once the settlement is finalized. A waiver carried out by an action, for example, might be based on whether a party in an agreement acts on a right, such as the right to terminate the deal in the first year of the contract. If it does not terminate the deal before the first year, that party waives its right to do so in the future.<br>  <br>  Insurance Dictionary: Waiver <br>  <br>  Relinquishment of a legal right to act. For example, an insured relies on statements of an agent of an insurance company concerning coverages under an insurance policy. Agents by their actions may have waived certain provisions the insurance company has written in the insurance policy, with the company's authority. Another example would be the provision in the Homeowners Insurance Policy that suspends coverage if a hazard is increased by the actions of an insured. An insured who stores explosives near the family home notifies the insurance company; the company grants permission to do so, thereby waiving its defense of the increase in hazard clause.<br>  <br>  Real Estate Dictionary: Waiver <br>  <br>  The voluntary renunciation, Abandonment or surrender of some claim, right, or privilege.<br>  Example: A Violation of a contract causes the need for a waiver from the other party who does not feel injured.<br>  <br>  Definition: giving up; letting go<br>  Antonyms: accept, claim, face<br>  <br>  v<br>  <br>  Definition: giving up<br>  Antonyms: acceptance, claim<br>  <br>  Law Encyclopedia: Waiver <br>  <br>  The voluntary surrender of a known right; conduct supporting an inference that a particular right has been relinquished.<br>  <br>  The term waiver is used in many legal contexts. A waiver is essentially a unilateral act of one person that results in the surrender of a legal right. The legal right may be constitutional, statutory, or contractual, but the key issue for a court reviewing a claim of waiver is whether the person voluntarily gave up the right. If voluntarily surrendered, it is considered an express waiver.<br>  <br>  (more........)|`|GutYNu9baa	To cancel, to treat as not being due anymore.|`|a0bfcb692e6a31a63435a6420bd941e3aa	Waiver - is a noun (some other answers treat it as a verb) - and it means that you have agreed to release or give up your rights to something (or give permission to do something). <br>  <br>  The verb, "to waive" is related and fits well with other answers already given

2NRCJgq2aa	The Theft Act provides no clear definition of dishonesty but provides situational context.  Section 2 of the 1968 Theft Act specifies three situations in which appropriation is NOT to be regarded as dishonest and one situation in which it MAY be regarded as dishonest.|`|fAcVndo7aa	With what was said before (which you didn't include, sorry), it's important that there is a clear definition of "dishonest".  The Theft Act doesn't include one, and cases involving the Act haven't defined "dishonesty" any better than the Act itself.  There are some examples of what can and can't be called "dishonest" in section 2 of the Theft Act, but they don't define exactly what "dishonesty" is.<br>  <br>  The bottom line?  The Theft Act sort of sucks, because it doesn't specify exactly what can and can't be considered theft - it just says that the alleged theft must involve "dishonesty", which is a judgement call.|`|AA10838998	Unfortunately there is no clear definition of dishonest.For comparison however there are three definitions which can be considered dishonest, and one ,that is not.

V9Ic4rhIaa	WELLLLLLL<br>  <br>  unfortunate at the Las Vegas Academy, the International Studies majors are often the most unpopular group because there are those students who basically apply for IS cause it's the easiest way to get it. Also, kids here don't think of IS as an "art" form. <br>  But aside from that the IS department is a good one. They participate in the language bowl every year which is a district competition for the language kids!! The French teachers are especially excellent :] I'm taking french. ALSO the IS department takes trips out of the country ever year or every other year depending on student interest. French majors to france, japanese majors to japan etc. <br>  <br>  If you're accepted, you'll take a language class which is to learn grammar and pronunciation which you probably will fall asleep in since you're bilingual :]<br>  but you also take a culture class every other day where you learn of the CULTURE :DDDDDD<br>  <br>  aside from that LVA is an AMAZING AMAZING AMAZING opportunity if you make it one. go to the art shows, watch the theater productions, participate in the clubs! Everything is AMAZING. you meet wonderful teachers and kids! <br>  <br>  if i could give you one advice on your studies at LVA, it's DO NOT PROCRASTINATE.<br>  <br>  <br>  PS. next year's freshman will be the last to be able to attend LVA for international studies. The program has been cut and it will be moved to another school.

JOXQrsw0aa	Without knowing anything about the internships except that you consider them to be highly competitive,  it is impossible to offer an opinion that is based on a comparison of  them versus the critical language scholarship. So, I'd say do whichever you really want and will be best for you.  The chances of getting in to a Top 3 Law School without legacy or diversity status and/or having graduated from Harvard, Yale, Stanford, Columbia or Princeton  are so remote, one has to wonder if it is worthwhile  to  choose one or another course of action   thinking it will make a significant difference. This is what the Assistant Dean of Admissions at Yale Law told me at a Law School Fair :  Applicants  with Yale Law legacy status have a 1 in 2.5 chance of being admitted. Everyone else has about a 1 in 25 chance of being admitted.  From Yale Law's current Law School Bulletin. In the classes of 2009, 2010 and 2011 the following universities have double digit representation:  Yale: 82. Harvard: 66 Stanford: 33 Columbia: 30 Princeton: 24,  Brown: 17,  Berkeley: 15,   Dartmouth: 15,   Duke: 11,  Williams: 11,  Penn: 11.<br>  The above students from 11 universities represent nearly half the present enrollment  at Yale Law School.  Nearly one  quarter of the class is from Harvard and Yale alone. It is highly unlikely that  this gross over representation of a handful of  universities could even begin to mirror the most qualified applicants that applied. Especially considering the extreme grade inflation at Harvard and a few other universities named above. The  number of legacy admits represented among these 11 universities graduates is of course unknown. <br>  <a href="http://www.yale.edu/bulletin/html/law/students.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.yale.edu/bulletin/html/law/st...</a>|`|UipuKjDlaa	collegefinder.my-age.net - try this site.

kTTwUY0Waa	I dont thinnk failing math is the issue, i think that dishonesty is what you are really worried about. If its not too personal, maybe you need to think about other things that might be bothering you, that have an effect on you r work. It sounds like your mom has put you under alot of pressure and in your desperation to live up to your high standards you have resorted to cheating. I think that you need to talk about all of these issues with your mom, the worst thing that you can do is say nothing. Remember as well that you already feel bad, so your mom making you feel worsse by punishing you isn't going to help, it sounds like you need to look at what you really want from your education and be able to talk to your mom about it. Take care.|`|wdUhwD61aa	You certainly aren't a stereotypical honor student...<br>  Yup, you're in trouble. You're probably in bigger trouble over forging your mums signature than anything. <br>  <br>  Look, there is NO way out of this. So go and tell your mum everything. Now, she will be mad and might yell. Do not yell back and do not argue the point, you did the wrong thing, here is where you have to take it. But there is a bright side. It's your mum, so she will always love you, just trust her and trust that she will forgive you. <br>  <br>  I wouldn't advise forging your mums signature again, someone will find out. Also, if you are havingtrouble in maths, ask for a tutor, or some help next time. :)|`|Ezty2VeTaa	You really should tell your mom. Lying only leads to more lies, which only gets your deeper in the hole. If you just tell her that you're having trouble with math, then she won't be too mad. The forged signature, though, is another story. She might be mad, she might not. It really depends on her personality. But trust me when I say that its a lot better if you tell her than if your teacher tells her. Alot can be said for honesty. Hope this helped.|`|rVlkHN18aa	<a href="http://inthisall.chills.it" rel="nofollow">http://inthisall.chills.it</a><br>  A very informative website, kindly stay a minute in website and enter you email address for getting your answer.|`|UYHe04Hcaa	TELL UR MOM DA TRUTH AS SHE UD DEFINATELY UNDERSTAND U.ALWAYS REMEMBER THAT UR MOM IS YOUR BEST FRIEND.

You should inform your parents that you are having trouble with the lessons at this academy. If you want to stay at the academy, then request a tutor. If you want to go back to a regular school then let your parents know. I have graduated from high school and I have been at the top of my classes as well. My parents have always been there for me. So I trust that your parents will understand you and respect you decisions. Be honest! Good Luck to you! If you ever want someone to talk to you can e-mail me anytime at zyreenahmargreat@yahoo.com.
cMZEmpp0aa	I find it pretty hard to believe that that's the price for a single year. I could see how four years of college could cost that, but the majority of students have some combination of scholarships, grants, loans, and jobs to pay for college anyway. It's pretty rare for a student to have to pay for every penny of their education.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure what you mean by "too hight to tell" though, so I'm afraid I don't quite know what you're asking.
2irsR8QXaa	Dalton's ideas were revolutionary in that they changed the way that scientists had thought of the atom for 2000 years (since Democritus). 2000 years!! His theory wasn't perfect but it was the most sound of his day and gave everyone else a groundwork to contribute to (Thompson, Rutherford, and Bohr wouldn't have been able to progress without Dalton's initial contributions).<br>  <br>  You can think of him at the chemists' version of Freud. He wasn't always right, but boy did he start something good. :)
Saul1Bhuaa	Why is it unattainable?  If your grades are superb, you can find an ivy league school that will accept you.|`|8zMh3QKWaa	Think about how much an Ivy League education costs. That should be a sobering reality check.|`|zJIv8EoQaa	Its always good to have goals that challenge you. Its whats keep us to continue to strive. Getting into an Ivy league school isn't an impossibility. Continue to work hard and do your research. If your grades aren't the best, don't go crazy. Make up for it by doing lots of extracurricular activities that you enjoy and can actually say you learned something from. When it comes to the question why you want to go to their school, make sure they know how much passion you have for wanting to get in.|`|8a855a9399c346980e74d5afafe6900baa	drink a WHOLE bunch.. burrrp!!!!
294db1e52bf0162d7d7ff79b4102975faa	Of course it may be how your school does things, but maybe they take into consideration if you are taking honors classes and give you an edge for that. Other than that, I don't know.|`|ivkGknUsaa	Well if you're friend has a higher GPA, it means she has grades which are a little bit better than yours in some classes. Your school probably considers other factors besides grades.
votSNHgJaa	Yes it does. When you want something, everything - except for impossibility - is possible.<br>  <br>  Okay, I think I made that more complicated.<br>  <br>  It simply means that if you aspire for something and you do everything to get that something, then nothing would be impossible. Except of course, impossibility.<br>  <br>  Ah, the wonders of the English language.|`|VKzlBZOvaa	theonly thing impossible to achieve is impossablility basically if that is even a thing.

MINy26pjaa	I was exactly like you.  I hated math in school and never went beyond basic algebra.  I also was a very logical thinker and wanted everything to be completely organized.  <br>  <br>  I ended up in an office management position where they fired the bookkeeper and wanted me to take over those duties.  I found that I absolutely adored it.  Almost all of the math is basic add, subtract, multiply, divide.  The only exceptions are things like depreciation and interest and such, and there are specific formulas that you follow for those things and it's very easy.  <br>  <br>  In accounting, everything is organized into categories (chart of accounts) and figuring out what category something goes into is a matter of logical rules.  All of the assets go on one side (credits, or pluses) and all of the liabilities (debits, or minuses)go on the other side and if you've done it right then all the credits and all the debits will balance out to zero.  If it's not zero, it's not right.  There's only one right answer.<br>  <br>  Take one basic accounting class.  By the end of it you will know if accounting is for you.  After that one job, I spent the next 17 years chasing zero's and loving it!

e739a2c4e1e2dcb4dfddc6736311a5ceaa	Passive causative is a fairly common construction used with the verbs 'have' and 'get' (maybe some others - can't think of any offhand).<br>  <br>  To help understand the passive, look at the active forms first:<br>  <br>  John had Fred fix his car. <br>  Susie had the beautician cut her hair.<br>  <br>  Those are active; John and Susie did the 'having', Fred did the fixing, and the beautician did the cutting.<br>  <br>  Now look at the passive forms:<br>  <br>  John had his car fixed.<br>  Susie got her hair cut.<br>  <br>  In these, there is no agent for the actions of fixing and cutting, but it's apparent that someone else did those, so it's a passive construction. Note that those passive constructions take the past participles, just like other passives. That's obvious for the fix/fixed pair, but not so apparent for the cut/cut since the participle is the same as the bare infinitive. Also note that the objects (car, hair) precede the verb form.<br>  <br>  The keys to recognizing the passive causative are;<br>  <br>  1. A form of the verbs have (has, had) or get (got).<br>  2. No agent specified<br>  3. Action verb past participle<br>  4. Object before verb.

ncqfq0b3aa	The admission exams at these for-profit schools are a joke. Even if you do bad, they will still admit you.<br>  <br>  Back when I considered Keller/DeVry, I did take the admission exam. The subject is determined by a computer so there is no set topic. My topic was on school uniforms. I did well and got a perfect score (my BA is in English, so I knew how to write a good essay).<br>  <br>  However, I withdrew from DeVry two days before I was supposed to start since I have heard horror stories about them. I didn't want to invest all of that money into a degree from a for-profit school. So I am now at a school with an excellent reputation.

The formula is this...<br>  <br>  PQ= x√3<br>  <br>  QR= x<br>  <br>  PR= 2x<br>  <br>  So, if you write down your coordinates on graphing paper, you see that PQ= 12 units. <br>  <br>  You have to now figure out what x is by knowing that x√3 = 12.<br>  <br>  Honestly, I'm sick right now and my head hurts too bad to risk getting a wrong answer of finding out what x is, but x√3 = 12 for sure.

For instance, at a private 4-year college it could cost you about $24,000/yr while at a resident-state college it may cost only $4000/yr. So really, the cost is entirely up to you and the college path you decide to take. <br>  Hope that helps!

Many masters programs in the sciences will pay YOU to do your degree, through research assistantships and teaching.  You're more likely to get funding if you enroll as a PhD program; you can just leave with a masters, many people do that.

He loves God and is well recognized in the writing community both at a university level and profession writers level.  He speaks all across the country several times a year and has his hand in nearly every major writing contest in the US.  You won't go wrong with Doc Hensley...and you can take that to the bank!
JtK5PiBFaa	Okay well in order to counsel people you would need to get at least a masters in Counseling Psychology. However, even then you would be making little money as opposed to someone with their Ph.D. I would suggest trying to get into a Clinical Psychology Ph.D program for two reasons. First, you will make more money in the long run and would be able to teach/do research on the side. Second, if you get into a Ph.D clinical psychology program they usually pay for your ENTIRE tuition. Granted, these programs are very hard to get into. Usually hundreds of people apply for only 10-12 spots. If you were to do Clinical Psychology you would be required to do a lot of research so you should consider if that's something you are interested in.<br>  <br>  If you want to do something related to Psychology that ALSO makes a lot of money you should look into Industrial/Organizational Psychology. You only need a masters and you can make as much as 170,000 per year just for helping companies out with their employees.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped!|`|TBZK5q78aa	Stop worrying about the time and effort that it takes to follow this dream.

JtK5PiBFaa	To become an anesthesiologist you need to attend four years of undergrad, 4 years of medical school and then 1-2 years of residency. They make A LOT of money so it will def. be worth it. Just know that you won't be making a lot your first couple of years because most of your earnings will go to paying back those student loans. In high school you should def take hard science classes like AP Physics, AP Chemistry and AP Biology. You also need to take math classes like AP Calc and AP Statistics. In college people who want to go to med school usually major in Biology or Chemistry in order to fulfill all of the pre reqs for Med School but you don't have to major in a science if you don't want to. Med school accepts undergrads with any major, just as long as you do the pre reqs and get good grades.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

It is typical for a pre-med student to major in something in the science field, since so much science is required for the pre-med sequence.  Biology, chemistry, and physics are all excellent majors.  Keep in mind you do not have to major in a science field as long as you take your prerequisites.  However, it is usually very helpful in preparation for medical school.  I highly recommend you take biochemistry, anatomy, physiology, genetics, immunology, and histology, even if they are not required for your major.  You will need electives, and these would be excellent.  These are usually very challenging courses at most medical schools and taking them in undergrad would definitely give you an advantage.

I have been home schooled since the second grade, and I'm now a Senior. I was born in Kansas. Up there, there were some fairly strict rules to follow, but you were not restricted from taking your kid out of public school. In Texas, where we live now, there are a lot less rules. You will have to check the laws of your country. It is quite possible that the head of the school will try to act all superior and powerful, but you still have the right to take your daughter out of school. One of my teachers in first grade was very opposed to my being home schooled, for example. Still, she could not do anything about it. Home schooling is very good, but you need to have more of a reason for it than a better GPA. My parents took me out of school because of the bad influences that were there and because I was too young to properly deal with them at the time. I am now taking dual enrollment classes and making A's on them all. What I mean is that her GPA certainly can improve.

I don't think graduating when you were 16 contributes to your chances of getting in, though. Speaking three languages definitely will help. A 2.27 is a pretty low GPA, just slightly above the "generally acceptable" mark. If this is the weakest part of your application, it sounds like its likely you'll get in. If you don't sound solid about the goals you want to accomplish while in college, though, you may have less of a chance. A 2.27 GPA and a lack of direction isn't very persuasive. From experience, I can say that university is way more challenging than community college. If you do get in, you're going to have to work harder to maintain your GPA.

There is a group of about 60-65 kids that get together one day each week. Most 'classes' have between 8 and 12 kids.  Parents all share teaching duties.  We teach Art, Science, History, Music, and P.E.  <br>  that way, on the other 3,4,or 5 days (whichever I decide to schedule) I can focus on Math, Language Arts, and Foreign Language.

She absolutely loves it.  <br>  <br>  Here is a link to the co-op site if you just want to get an idea of what it's like.  You can check around to see if there are any similar ones in your area.

I also have it on good authority from my kids that all that reading aloud helped them in their ability to listen to college lectures.  :)<br>  <br>  In some way or other raising children is work regardless of what method or program you use.

AA10176626	Ah, Mr. Griffin, you have a lot of financial aid questions, don't you?<br>  <br>  Your EFC score is used by the financial aid office at your college or university to determine what forms of aid you are qualified to receive.<br>  <br>  An EFC of zero identifies you as an aid applicant who demonstrates "exceptional need". This classification makes you eligible for the special forms of federal student aid known as "need-based aid".<br>  <br>  The need-based aid programs include the well known Pell Grant, but there are also other, supplementary grant programs (FSEOG, SMART, ACG), a couple of special lending programs (Perkins and subsidized Stafford), and the Federal Work Study Program.<br>  <br>  Qualifying for need-based aid and actually receiving need-based aid are two different things. All students who qualify for need-based aid will receive a Pell Grant. Your Pell Grant award will be determined entirely by your EFC score, by your registration classification (full-time, part-time), and by your school's Cost of Attendance. (I'll get back to this in a minute.)<br>  <br>  All other forms of need-based aid are awarded to financial aid recipients from  limited pools of funds that are allocated to your school each year. The school will not have sufficient funds to award each form of aid to all students who qualify. That's part of the reason why it's imperative that financial aid recipients submit their annual aid paperwork prior to the school's "priority aid deadline". Students who miss those deadlines will generally not be considered for any of the discretionary forms of need-based aid.<br>  <br>  As mentioned, you will receive a Pell Grant - that's guaranteed to all students who qualify. You will also be offered an opportunity to borrow from the Stafford lending program. This is a government-backed loan, and you will not be required to answer any questions about your income, your debts, or your credit history. Stafford borrowers are not required to provide a cosigner.<br>  <br>  Financial aid is intended to assist recipients with the Cost of Attendance at their school - an estimate of what it will cost the average student to pay for tuition, school fees, books, room and board, and other miscellaneous education-related expenses. Your aid eligibility is calculated from this Cost of Attendance "starting point".<br>  <br>  Keep in mind, however, that few students receive sufficient aid to cover their entire Cost of Attendance - however, because your school seems to be a low-cost option, it may well be possible that you will receive enough aid to pay most of your educational expenses.<br>  <br>  Your aid will be paid directly to your school on your behalf. They will apply any money received directly to your student account balance. Once your balance has been paid, additional funds (the 'overage') will be returned to you - but remember - this is not "extra" money. Students are not permitted to "profit" from financial aid assistance. <br>  <br>  Any "overage" that you receive is meant to pay the education related expenses that are not paid directly to the school - your books, your room and board, your gas money to and from school, etc.<br>  <br>  If you use 'overage' money for non-school expenses, that's just like if your parents gave you money to buy a school lunch. If you used that money to buy a comic book or a chocolate bar on the way to school, you would have spent the money that had been given to you for lunch, and you'd now probably go without.<br>  <br>  If you spend your education aid on non-education expenses, you won't have the money you need to pay the school stuff.<br>  <br>  Overages are generally returned to the student 2-4 weeks into the new semester. <br>  <br>  I hope that helped - good luck!|`|LVZdzPmpaa	EFC is "expected family contribution." Given your situation and  your family's circumstances, they are not, for this year, expected to contribute anything to your educational expenses. This means that you will receive the maximum award.<br>  <br>  Once the school (where you have been accepted) gets the FAFSA info, they will prepare an award package for you and notify you by mail. The package will include federal grant monies, state grants if your state has them and probably a student loan. You will indicate your acceptance of the offer.<br>  <br>  The monies for the year will be divided into two semesters with half being sent to the school for each term. Once your tuition and fees (including room and board) are paid, the balance of the funds will be disbursed to you. This generally takes a week to ten days after school starts. The school can give you more details.|`|LMUGZvgVaa	Yes! That's great, it means your family isn't expected to give you money for college, and the fafsa will most likely cover more of your college.

Typically, you'll take a placement exam, meet an academic adviser, register for classes (pick them out then typically online sign up for them), and then go to new student orientation.<br>  <br>  You will go to college as an undergrad for 4 years.  You can get your degree in your interest area to prep you for law school.  You could do your 4 year degree in Government, Political Science, or anything you like but ideally something which will help you in Law.  Have you seen the movie Legally Blond?  The lead character got her degree in Fashion then went to law school.  Now, your law school is looking for something like gov or polt science or something like that.  <br>  <br>  Then around the senior year or towards the end you do the LSAT which is a exam that qualifies you for Law school.  Law schools look for a certain number and that will help determine your place in line for law school as well...at least it's one contributing factor.  <br>  <br>  Then you will go to Law school and do interships.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|PKRZtwyHaa	?|`|JOXQrsw0aa	You would be better off doing a good three year LLB in the UK and then applying for  an LLM degree, usually a one year degree program  here in the US. In most states this will allow a student to sit the bar exam, which is required to practice law in the USA. There are no solicitors and barristers, just attorneys.   If the LLM is not enough in the state a student desires to practice law to allow him to take the bar exam, then go for an LLD or JSD, usually two more years. I don't think there is any state in which someone who earned a JSD/LLD could not sit the Bar Exam. Many  LLM programs are designed for international students and are much easier to gain admission to than the JD program at the same school. Even at very prestigious Law Schools. <br>  <br>  If  you want to come to the US to study for an undergraduate degree,  you will not be considered a state resident and will have to pay out of state fees which can be quite high. It will probably be less expensive to go to a private university because they usually grant back part of the tuition charged.<br>  <a href="http://www.fao.fas.harvard.edu/" rel="nofollow">http://www.fao.fas.harvard.edu/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.yale.edu/admit/freshmen/financial_aid/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.yale.edu/admit/freshmen/finan...</a><br>  Also understand that an undergraduate degree is very different in the US. In the UK a student earning a degree in Economics only usually studies Economics. In the US a student majoring in Economics might only take  1/3 of his classes in Economics. A UK Bachelor's degree is at the same level of knowledge in the subject matter as a US Masters. This is why UK universities now have  one year M.Sc. programs. These are designed to bring an American degree holder in the subject to a UK level bachelors degree level of knowledge in the subject. It used to be that Americans going to Oxford or Cambridge on a Rhodes Scholarship had to spend two years earning a BA degree. Also we don't have year long courses that span several terms,  with exams in June,  that determine the grade for the course. Most universities are on the semester or quarter system(really only 3 quarters since summer is off. Two 15 week semesters or three  10 week quarters.) Each class is usually terminal at the end of each semester or quarter, with the final exam in the course being taken then. There are also mid term exams during the semester or quarter and there may be other graded assignments.  When  a semester or quarter long course is finished, it is finished and a grade is assigned. <br>  <br>  To go to a US Law School to earn a first Law Degree, a J.D., the undergraduate degree can be in any subject. Law Schools are very expensive in this country and the only money usually available to pay  is in the form of loans. Even the Law School here at Berkeley, a public university,  will be $40,000 per year tuition for in state residents next Fall. <br>  <br>  Most Universities require a College Prep Curriculum in High School and  the SAT or ACT exam and some also require two or three  SAT 2 Subject Exams.<br>  Here are the requirements at Berkeley, UCLA and the rest of the UC's.<br>  <a href="http://universityofcalifornia.edu/admissions/undergrad_adm/paths_to_adm/freshman/subject_reqs.html" rel="nofollow">http://universityofcalifornia.edu/admiss...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/admissions/eligibility.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/ad...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.ucop.edu/ucal/admissions/undergrad_adm/selecting/camp_profiles.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ucop.edu/ucal/admissions/unde...</a><br>  The other possibility is to attend a Junior College for one or two years and then transfer to a 4 year university. JC's generally have open enrollment. It is fairly easy to transfer to most of the UC's for a California Community College student. <br>  <a href="http://students.berkeley.edu/admissions/transfer.asp" rel="nofollow">http://students.berkeley.edu/admissions/...</a><br>  <a href="http://students.berkeley.edu/files/Admissions/12626_5.Info_TransAdm.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://students.berkeley.edu/files/Admis...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.ucsd.edu/prospective-students/admissions/undergraduate-admissions/transfer/tag.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ucsd.edu/prospective-students...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.admissions.ucla.edu/Prospect/Adm_tr/ADM_CCO/tap.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.admissions.ucla.edu/Prospect/...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.tap.ucla.edu/faq.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.tap.ucla.edu/faq.htm</a><br>  <a href="http://www.admissions.ucla.edu/prospect/adm_tr.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.admissions.ucla.edu/prospect/...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.admissions.ucla.edu/prospect/Adm_tr/Tr_Prof.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.admissions.ucla.edu/prospect/...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.admissions.ucsb.edu/prospective/TAGLetter.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.admissions.ucsb.edu/prospecti...</a><br>   If going to a Public University, it will be much less if you come here for a year and live without going to school and establish residency in the state you wish to attend a university. This will allow you to only have to pay in state fees. For instance at Berkeley in state fees at the undergrad level are about $7500.00/year. Out of state fees are about $30,000/year. And this is only tuition. Room and Board at Berkeley adds another $9,000.00- $15,000 per year depending on accomodations. Or around $7,000 per year in the Berkeley Student Co-Ops.

fBq6gCuAaa	I don't know about the current events part, but maybe this picture would be a great representation of the quote. I feel that it fits pretty well.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://th00.deviantart.com/fs18/300W/i/2008/134/7/1/Be_Yourself_by_Xerces.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://th00.deviantart.com/fs18/300W/i/2...</a>
inZ9CWBiaa	I suspect that many of the retirements will not result in job openings as schools' budgets are being squeezed. Schools will not be able to replace teachers who are retiring, but will run with smaller teaching staffs. A lot of school districts have frozen hiring due to tight budgets already.|`|G50ucmllaa	This is what I have hear as well.  However my mom is one of those eligible to retire and is not partly due to the economy (mostly because she can't sit still for more than 30 minutes).|`|IeTfFv29aa	Yes, especially in the areas of Special Education and Bilingual Education. <br>  However, in my district there are significant cut backs because of the economy.<br>  If you are looking, be patient and willing to take a job as late as early September!|`|CptGRMSlaa	There is always an open job somewhere, you might just have to move to find one.|`|YX93lq4daa	Depends on where you are..in my state the lack of jobs has nothing to do with a bad economy, there was never any jobs.  To many candidates for too little jobs!
0qJfXlURaa	It's not for everyone. Not everyone has the patience for it. Not everyone can manage the stress level. It's a stressful job.<br>  <br>  If you don't like babies, then you need to find a job that doesn't require you to work with them. I, myself, would not work with babies, as I just don't have any interest in them.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, you might want to give yourself some time to actually become accustomed to your new work environment. Changing jobs and starting a new job is stressful in itself, so don't judge too quickly because your perception may be clouded by outside factors.|`|f6v64lmMaa	Hi Josi<br>  I am not clear  what ages group you  will be working with in your job. I live in Australia and I think of Nursery as babies but if you live in the UK Nursery is 3-5 year olds.<br>  I have been in the business for many years and it is a very rewarding job. You do need to have alot of patience and understanding and be an active team player.  Babies are not for everyone. I prefer the older children.The Nursery Nurse course is worth doing if you want to work with children as it gives you the qualifications to work with all ages up to 8. It did when I did in 1988. It has all changed now though. If you love working with children stick it out it is worth it.  Maybe tell your employers that yo prefer the older aged group you may need to work with babies for a short period in order to get the qualifications. With a qualification like Nursery Nursing it is regconised in most places. Good Luck and I hope this helps you.

You can be intelligent, but do stupid things which happens all the time. Intelligence only measures brain power. Wisdom helps a person distinguish what is rational and irrational. Remember, a genius can go to jail for a crime a retarded person could go to jail for.|`|9298mlxoaa	Yes Most def.|`|1HLPznZhaa	YES !|`|fhOnkH5Eaa	s,some stupid people who were not coming for study only for make mischief.|`|bVHm5AUEaa	O yea..I like to call these people SLACKERS or just lazya$$es|`|fSkt7SgDaa	HAHA oh my are you in for a surprise.

IWSc7xkiaa	Field trips can be great for students. They get the opportunity to break out of the monotony of the school schedule and learn away from school. They get to see new things that they may not get the chance to see otherwise. They get to interact with each other as well as their teachers in a more relaxed environment.<br>  <br>  However, if the trip is not planned properly it can be a nightmare. These trips need responsible chaperons who are not afraid to keep a group of students in line, but are also relaxed enough to not be an overbearing parent. And, of course, the trip should have an educational value in some shape or form.|`|stMcVPCMaa	Absolutely, assuming proper chaperoning.  Travel is very educational and helps you learn to see the world from others' perspectives.
fSkt7SgDaa	The University of Central Florida is a fantastic school. One of the best schools in Florida. Many students that go there are very happy.

UCF is really a great school and there is a ton of things to do around the school.|`|ZpsbW8gHaa	how about coming up to the north east?|`|ZXPXepumaa	Well, it is an okay state school. If you want to go to Florida I would recommend going to the University of South Florida or the University of Miami.

hISwD8tcaa	It would be best to do something related you the course you want to go in. So perhaps take part in a first aid course? Your local adult education centre should run some during the summer like for families, I went to one with my mum once, it was really cheap and good fun too. <br>  <br>  Joining the red cross or st johns ambulance and doing voluntary work with them would look really good on a CV/personal statement, and give you an insight into whether or not its what you want to do and youll learn new skills.<br>  <br>  good luck at getting in!|`|Cbom3Lweaa	Have you done a st john ambulances course? That might help
1W4e8JBIaa	You need to search for beautiful makeups picture, and like speaking of being girl is looking beautiful. For example, Gymnasiums and fitness centers are being opened everywhere so that people are able to maintain their physique. This also helps them stay healthy and reduces the risk of killer diseases. Film stars, models and others considered to be extremely beautiful are treated with respect all over the world.  You need to think and explain good points all to the students.|`|WytfaeWeaa	do you have to just talk about it ike this is how you would straighten your hair or do you have to actually do it ??
aGwYH0Qnaa	You should try Devry/Keller's Graduate School of Management.  They just received their accreditation from PMI.  There are only 13 other schools with that accreditation.  I just recently started the program and so far it's awesome!
ZdIaVkIcaa	yes she could.<br>  <br>  Helen Keller (June 27, 1880 – June 1, 1968) was an American author, political activist and lecturer. She was the first deafblind person to earn a Bachelor of Arts degree. The story of how Keller's teacher, Annie Sullivan, broke through the isolation imposed by a near complete lack of language, allowing the girl to blossom as she learned to communicate, has become known worldwide through the dramatic depictions of the play and film The Miracle Worker.<br>  <br>  A prolific author, Keller was well traveled and was outspoken in her opposition to war. She campaigned for women's suffrage, workers' rights, and socialism, as well as many other progressive causes.<br>  <br>  See source for more info.|`|xvey8ixPaa	Yes, she could. She could also sing and dance. She was very accomplished and had many talents.
xxTLiXVWaa	My status is still showing "Pending" on my webportal.    <br>  <br>  May I ask what your GPA is?  or do you know why you got denied?  because I have a 3.21 and so afraid of getting denied.|`|DlMsJPwUaa	wanted to<br>  got denied<br>  oh well<br>  <br>   Below: My GPA a 3.1, my SAT is about a 1550 no ACT, so I understand why I got denied, hey at least you have a better chance than me! Good luck
xxTLiXVWaa	My admission status is still showing "Pending" on my webportal.  Did you already get accepted?  <br>  <br>  May I ask what was your GPA and the department that you were applying to?  I just want to see if I would have a chance or not.
XJXsFn9paa	Come on, it is not that challenging if you actually think about it for a minute or two. At *least* attempt the question before you ask for help, and then ask for help on a specific part of it, don't just write out the entire question.
ItRW5RbVaa	Get a part-time job and ask for a loan. Try explaining your situation to the school to see if they can have some kind of consideration.. =) I'm sorry & good luck!|`|fSkt7SgDaa	Try taking out a loan. You can also try and wait it out for a year to see if the economy gets better.
DorePwVOaa	Having a parent in prison does not, unfortunately, allow you to be considered independent on the FAFSA. You've pretty much hit the nail on the head: you need to get married or join the military to be considered independent.<br>  <br>  However, remember that the FAFSA is just a guide for most schools. Although the Department of Education is inflexible on the independence issue, your school may not be. Talk to a financial aid officer at your school right away, and let them know your situation. They will be your best bet in finding extra aid and scholarships.|`|G1a8nFJHaa	FAFSA won't consider you to be independent, but it WILL take into account the fact that your dad is in prison. Fill out the FAFSA forms anyway. You'll most likely qualify for more aid that you think.<br>  <br>  Then go talk to a financial aid adviser at your school and see if there are any special scholarships that you qualify for. <br>  <br>  Also ask about teaching aide (TA) positions at your school. They usually pay a decent amount of non-taxable money and some schools offer tuition waivers to their TAs.|`|D8SpQAgLaa	At your age the only way to be an independent is to be legally married. Get married on paper. Find someone else in the same situation. There is no legal requirement you love them, or even be in a relationship with them, or live with them. Have a judge do it in a courtroom for $50. Sign a prenup. Then get a "divorce" when you're both done with college.
k2hw2IPfaa	see if they have it in this forum. You download free ebooks.<br>  www.amaderforum.com

Ask them, "Why are you making fun of me...I want an honest answer?" I bet they will not be able to answer it b/c they are such jerks. Most bullies do not think straight because they are so busy bullying. They do not have someone to look up to and if they do they think they are too cool for them. I hope you continue to wear your glasses...they make you look smart and intelligent and most importantly they help you to see.  I hate bullies like you do. I was bullied in school...now I am in college getting my bachelors degree in early childhood education. I will be able to teach kids like you. I will teach kids from preschool through 3rd grade. I hope you keep believing in yourself and if they keep bugging you pray for them. Even though that sounds really crazy...pray for them. They might not have a good home life...maybe they are bullied by their older sibling so they take out their anger on you...which isn't right at all I know.<br>  Believe in yourself kid! And try to stay away from them if at all possible. Walking away from them is smart even if they tease you while walking away know that you are smarter than they are.<br>  good luck!|`|DyrJKd83aa	sorry to hear this lad.<br>  people/children are always cruel to anyone different.<br>  think on-if you need them now you probably wont have bad eyesight and have to wear them when older.<br>  glasses make you look intelligent ok<br>  you`re already more intelligent than the bullies-if you ignore them.|`|SxI6y9GWaa	They are just trying it on.  If you show that it bothers you they will do it all the more.  If you grit your teeth and pretend you couldn't care less what they say, they'll get bored and stop doing it.  If you are getting bullied at school, tell a teacher.|`|hktbfRPWaa	Kids can be cruel. Nothing wrong with wearing glasses. If people are bullying you tell your parents and your teacher|`|eBIF1TEQaa	People can be cruel, it could be because you are quiet more than anything.  Just say to them 'jealousy will get you nowhere'  then ignore them.  Eventually they will leave you alone.<br>  <br>  If there are bullies, they will always find someone to bully about something.  They will bully if the person is fat, if they are thin, if they are tall or short, it doesn't matter ... these are kids who probably have nothing better to do & when they get a little older, they will have no friends & you will have lots.<br>  <br>  <br>  |`|tuZ6bYnqaa	People are intimidated by people who look intelligent, glasses generally are associated with being 'nerdy'.  They see your glasses and think that your smart and so they think if he's smart he's not cool, but just think of it this way 'Be nice to the nerds, they'll be your boss when you're older'.<br>  <br>  |`|cF5fdfFxaa	now lets get something right here you don't get bullied because of your glasses you get bullied because you do something that makes them want to bully you .So many people wear glasses and are the coolest kids at school so you have just got to change your attitude don't let them do that |`|qz1OapGaaa	Because kids of that age are very nasty, People with glasses look and are very intelligent and that scares the bully's.<br>  <br>  So that's why they do it.<br>  <br>  But but dont worry because your better than them.|`|mxiNAKPbaa	i also wear glasses and have had a hard time at primary school trust me when you go secondary school this will end<br>  try going to a teacher and telling them <br>  try telling the bully its not nice and leave you alone |`|kgZGrgsTaa	just ignore them all your different and should be proud!! bcos when they all grow up they are all guna be the same and YOU your guna be different and people will like that about you bcos different is GOOD! xx|`|O7BZUhNWaa	you spell better than most adults do on here, and decent grammar, maybe thats the reason.|`|irUehx61aa	You're not allowed to use yahoo answers.|`|IyT4FiVsaa	Simply put, they have nothing better to do!

I expect the fat kids get picked on for being fat, the ginger kids get picked on for being ginger, the short kid gets picked on for being short, the clever kid gets picked on for being clever. It's not just you dude. You could point out what is odd about the bullies and see if you can get other people to start picking on them instead, but then you will become a bully yourself.<br>  <br>  Also it might be that they think you won't fight back because your glasses might get broken. If you want to be direct, calmly take them off, put them on the table and give that bully the hardest whack on his nose with the palm of your hand (it's easier and more accurate than punching) twist your hips towards the side you are striking with to get maximum power. I probably will get thumbs down for telling you this, and you will definetly gete in a lot of trouble for it, but if you can get a bit of blood out this one time, then next time someone teases you, just calmly take of your glasses and look serious. Remember, you only get one chance at this so pick the biggest kid, and if it works or not, don't ever do it again, you will get a bad reputation.<br>  <br>  The politically correct answer is to not let it bother you, eventually they will get bored and leave you alone etc etc. But I remember what it was like. Here is a big lesson in life - If something is upsetting you, don't just whine about it, do something and sort it out.<br>  <br>  Now I wear contact lenses and nobody knows.|`|5262fe93c4b1d7b6995cac9b58a8ab50aa	Have you tried standing up to this bully. A bully will usually back off if you answer them back because a bully is only tough in front of other people. By themselves they are the biggest cowards. And also bullies are people who have no confidence in themselves. Since you are only 8 why don't you have a word with your mum or dad or whoever you living with and let them go speak to the head of your school. I really hope you'll be ok because it's not nice to be bullied|`|CAaCm5Gxaa	Well your 8 so your young, <br>  Don't worry about it. You need to Understand that even the coolest people get picked on by someone else. Nothing is wrong with you and i am sure you dont look funny wearing glasses or anything like that. Kids are mean sometimes, what you need to do is find the people that like you for who you are as long as you have true friends you wont have to worry about those other guys who have nothing better to do than pick on other people... Look at them when they say that stuff and tell them I dont care what you think, your nobody to me.. or be nice about and say thats your opinion but not mine. <br>  <br>  Your a cool kid <br>  i am sure of it <br>  <br>  hope this helps<br>  |`|YQD2bToRaa	Other people will point out our differences to feel better about their own perceived "coolness", also trying to keep themselves from being picked on. A lot of cool people wear glasses, ignore them and don't loose your cool. They are playing a game where they win if they can make you feel insecure, don't fall for the trick. |`|JB5lPWESaa	Awwwww........... do they really bully you. That justs hurts me so much. You must be a cute adorable boy. Awwwwwwwwwwwwwww...... should I beat them up for you. There just jealous of you, that your so cute and there so not. Don't take notice and just have fun and study.

AA11791155	Community college usually has more dedicated students and mature adults who want to learn.

If you want to party - forget community college|`|sO2CKU1uaa	Really the only way to go to community college is a) you wanna save money or b) your high school grades aren't good enough.

Not only do you get a degree from the 4 year college, but you pay significantly less for the two years that you were in community college. When you transfer to another school, they no longer look at SAT/ACT's to accept you, but your grades and classes from the other college. One important thing to keep in mind though is that not all classes transfer from one college to another. While the community college accepts English 101 or whatever the 4 year college may not accept the course and only give you elective credit for the 'core' classes. I would check with guidance councellors from both to make sure of this, but otherwise I think you have a great idea.
nefMZhE6aa	Virginia Tech!
JpDLQBitaa	Well first you must finish high school and get excepted into a university. In your 4 years at your university you can major in anything but it is recammened that you major in a science like biology, chemistry, physics. During either your junior or senior year of college you must take the MCAT which is the The Medical College Admissions Tests(MCAT) so med. schools can see where you rank among other students. Lots of med. schools also require private interviews with students so you might have to do that also. And if you do get accepted by a med school you will need to study there for 4 more years. Once you finish your 4 years of med. school you go into your Residency where you do 3-5 years of training in care for patients. And if you want to specialize in something you do 2-3 more years of your Fellowship where you specialize in a specific illness or injury. After that your basically a doctor. Good Luck.

(There are deferments for military service, the Peace Corps, continued schooling, etc.)<br>  <br>   In the case of a hardship deferment, you would provide information regarding your hourly wage and specify how many hours you normally work. The three-month average is intended to cover a period that would reflect the frequency or infrequency of overtime, layoffs, decreased hours, etc. You also provide information about your living expenses. <br>  <br>  On the deferment form, there is a space to explain extenuating circumstances.

fPOg9DuXaa	I am a teacher and most of my students speak Spanish as their first language and are currently learning English. I do no let them speak Spanish in class because it is an SEI class (Structured English Immersion) and so instruction is conducted only in English. However, Spanish is sometimes used to utilize understanding of a new concept. Students respond to me in English though and when they are working in a group, sometimes they slip into Spanish, and I make them go back into English. <br>          As far as the playground, the students in my school are able to speak in Spanish on the playground on their free time. About half of them do. There is no punishment for that. But when they come to me with a problem, I say, "English, please" because my Spanish is limited and I want them to explain it in English. <br>          The only time it would be a problem is if they were speaking Spanish around students who only speak English and were making them feel uncomfortable or left out because they other student could not understand what was going on around them. <br>         I encourage them to speak in English on the playground as much as possible though because they are learning English and I would like them to practice. English is necessary to their success in school, and this is for their own good. <br>          So, maybe you need to ask your child's teacher why he/she is not allowing them to speak Spanish. If they are isolating other students, that is a good reason. Or maybe he/she is just encouraging them to practice. If they are not bothering anyone else and just speaking Spanish amongst themselves, I doubt it would be a problem. <br>  I hope this helps!|`|G50ucmllaa	Perhaps, but you need to be more specific.  When can they not speak Spanish?  Are they effectively communicating through Spanish or is it a distraction in the classroom.  Why are your children speaking Spanish in school?  It is done to say unkind things about people or is it simply done culturally among peers during social time?  But I don't think you have any children, or surly hope not  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AqCyKnh9H_W.fiLfC3B6Rjfty6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20080331183709AA35npf">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|pgFD4n1Caa	You can't take legal action but before reacting why don't you talk to the teacher and ask why.<br>  As a teacher myself, I bet that they want the kids to learn english. Are these second langague learners meaning - they are learning to speak English and write in English.  It is hard for teachers to teach kids that can't communicate in English. If they don't understand the language, how do they learn anything in school.  Although I see a strong benefit to knowing 2 langues, I think in school their focus should be learning and conversing in English and the teacher is probably encouraging this. On the playground is an ideal time to practice the language becuse it is in a natural setting. Perhaps encouraging the students to speak spanish only at home outside of school would help.|`|VWAl3tcnaa	Why don't you be content in speaking Spanish with your children at home and let them learn to be proper English speakers from school, and no, I do not think you can take any legal action against the teacher for imposing English only speaking in the class room.  When I took Spanish language in school my Spanish teacher's first rule was that whenever we were in her class room we all needed to speak Spanish.  How is that different from your children's teacher.  FYI, when my parents and we, their children, migrated to the U.S. my father made a rule that us children will speak only in English.  All of us children are much stil fluent in our own native tongue beside very much more fluent in English.|`|a7eE92RPaa	It's understandable, especially because it regards a teacher's liability. The teacher doesn't know what they are saying to each other so something may happen like a fight breaking out and the teacher would be a sitting duck as to how it all started and could possibly lose their job.

AA10176626	Lucie:<br>  <br>  There are no restrictions on working a second job while participating in the Federal Work Study program, but you can only have one "work-study" job, unless you get permission from the financial aid office.<br>  <br>  There is, however, an earnings issue.<br>  <br>  Money earned from your work-study job is not counted against you as "income" when you complete the FAFSA for the following year.<br>  <br>  Money earned from a non-work study job IS considered income, and must be reported when completing next year's FAFSA.<br>  <br>  Earn too much money from your "second" part-time job, and it COULD impact the amount of aid you are offered next year. <br>  <br>  I hope that helps. Good luck to you!|`|LVZdzPmpaa	Wages earned from a work-study job are part of the financial aid package of that award year. <br>  <br>  Other money that you earn in another job counts as income that may count against you when you complete your next FAFSA that reflects the year in which the wages were earned. <br>  <br>  There is no set amount you can make, but it will increase the EFC (the amount you and your family are expected to contribute). <br>  <br>  It's a completely screwed up system, but essentially, the more you make working the less help you will get in terms of grants from the federal and state governments (depending on your state's program).<br>  <br>  If I were you, I wouldn't worry about socking money away to pay for student loans that you're borrowing now. It's a good idea in theory, but it will backfire in the short run.<br>  <br>  Since there is more to consider than how much you make in any given year (parent's income, equity in a home, properties, savings, etc.), you might sit down with your Financial Aid Officer and get some more details. <br>  <br>  The best way around a lot of this is to take jobs that pay in cash (like babysitting, odd jobs), waiting tables and bartending.|`|w2PDUIXpaa	Your financial aid package is dependent on two factors - the first and most significant, is your EFC or expected family contribution. This amount is calculated based on your family's financial situation at the time the application is submitted. Not only is income considered here, but also assets including money in the bank, investments, ect. The second factor, your personal contribution, is also used to calculate the award and also relates to not only your income but your personal assets as well. <br>  <br>  Should you take another job in addition to your workstudy job you will be increasing the value of your personal contribution as calculated once next year's FAFSA is processed thereby decreasing the gap between the Estimated Tuition Costs and PC+EFC, lowering the amount of aid that is estimated to be needed.<br>  <br>  So to answer your question, working in a job other than work-study that is on the books will most likely lower your award next year no matter what the amount actually is that you make in the second job.

AA10399655	The key to this problem is to realize that speed is equal to total distance divided by total time.  <br>  <br>  Downstream, the speed of the boat in still water plus the current (B + C) is equal to 210 miles / 10 hours, or 21 miles per hour (mph).  <br>  <br>  Upstream, the speed is 210 miles / 70 hours, or 3 mph.  <br>  <br>  The equations are B + C = 21 and B - C = 3 <br>  <br>  Add these two equations (C plus negative C = 0) to get 2B = 24 mph and B = 12 mph.  If B - C = 3 mph and B = 12 mph, C is therefore 9 mph.  Pretty strong current.|`|QwbOCHSTaa	If you find the mph the boat was traveling up and down stream and then subtract them you should get the speed of the current.

ECRubC1uaa	Actually it's the reverse of what the last person said (not that it was wrong, but I'm just rearranging it for emphasis):<br>  <br>  Talent, experience, and a good camera.<br>  <br>  Experience by far surpasses any degree as long as you are pulling out great images.  I know lots of people with degrees who still can't produce great images  Also I've seen people with 50 so called years of experience who also can't produce great images.  <br>  <br>  I'm not too familiar with the UK style of teaching (which I believe GCSE's are from), but are needed for secondary education.  If you plan to go to college, which I would recommend, then you would probably have to take math.  Which is probably irrelevant to photography, not that you don't need it, but it is more important for the secondary education purposes.<br>  <br>  I'd suggest following a studio photographer, or shadowing a wedding photographer in your area if you plan to go into it.  I'm sure you are still a teen?

DorePwVOaa	I took two quarters off when I was in a situation very, very similar to yours. A few suggestions based on my experience:<br>  <br>  If you have any student loans, they may enter the grace period or repayment. That means if it takes more than 6 months for you to go back to school (including summer!) then you will have to start making payments on your student loans.<br>  <br>  If you're going to take the time off, decide before spring quarter starts. I did one week of winter quarter before I made up my mind, and had to pay a bunch of fees and housing costs that I wouldn't have to have paid if I'd decided one or two weeks earlier.<br>  <br>  Make sure you have real, actual job prospects when you take time off. I spent the first two months of my time off looking for jobs. It would have been much better if I could have started work as soon as I stopped school.<br>  <br>  Tackle your credit card debt with a fever. Make it your number one priority, and if you have more than one card, work on paying the one with the highest interest rate first. But make sure you pay at least the minimum on all of your debts, and pay on time. Late fees will kill your progress!<br>  <br>  Do some research on personal finance and paying for college. There are a ton of free, awesome resources online. I will link some in the sources. There are also some really great books - try your school's library or your public library.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|kT8rhVdLaa	as long as you go back in the fall and don't make any excuses why you shouldn't go back in the fall.

dycsTrcraa	If you are asking if it is plagiarism- the answer is yes.  By most definitions plagiarism includes plagiarism of someone else's ideas (even if you change the words around a little)|`|qnL2JYihaa	No.  You have added nothing new at all.
khswD4Giaa	#1<br>  <br>  The first step usually is to find a common denominator, but in this case there is no shortcut. You find the common denom the long way by multiplying the two denominators together.<br>  "Foil": (X+5)(X-5)= X^2-25. This will be the new denominator for those first two numbers.<br>  The second step is to find the new values of the numerator. Since you can't just multiply a number to the denominator without changing the numerator, you will need to take the denominator of one and multiply it by the numerator of the other. Another way to look at this is, (x+5)/(x+5)=1, so when you multiply 2/(x+5) by (x+5)/(x+5), you are really multiplying by one and not changing the value of the fraction, just the numerical representation of the value. This needs to be done to both fractions.<br>  <br>  ((x+5)/(x+5))*(2/(x-5)=(2x+10)/(x^2-25...<br>  ((x-5)/(x-5))*(1/(x+5))=(x-5)/(x^2-25)<br>  (x-5-(2x+10)/(x^2-25))=(x-5-2x-10/(x^2...<br>  -x-15+6/(x^2-25)=   -x-9/(x^2-25)<br>  <br>  #2<br>  <br>  Dividing two fractions is the same as multiplying them with the denominator (of the larger division) flipped upside down.<br>  So this question is the same as:<br>  <br>  x^3+y^3/x+y (multiplied by) x^2+y^2/x^2-xy+y^2<br>  All you need to do here is FOIL<br>  (x^3+y^3)(x^2+y^2)<br>  /<br>  (x+y)(x^2-xy+y^2)<br>  I did not FOIL that for you, you should do some of the work :)

a01a4c7fa42d359ddf53eaa686c7f84faa	First, flip the equation over.  As an example, if 2/3 = a/b, then 3/2 = b/a.  We can do the same thing with this equation to get this:<br>  <br>  a/p = 1/(1+p) ----> p/a = (1 + p)/1 ----> p/a = 1 + p.<br>  <br>  Now multiply both sides of the last equation by a to clear fractions:<br>  <br>  p/a = 1 + p<br>  (a)(p/a) = (a)(1 + p)<br>  p = a + ap.<br>  <br>  Now isolate all terms containing p on one side of the equation:<br>  <br>  p - ap = a.<br>  <br>  Factor out p from both terms on the left side of the equation above:<br>  <br>  p - ap = a<br>  p (1 - a) = a.<br>  <br>  Divide both sides of the equation above by (1 - a) to solve for p:<br>  <br>  p (1 - a) = a<br>  p = a/(1 - a)<br>  <br>  In the final step, a is restricted from being 1, because then the denominator in the fraction a/(1 - a)  would be (1 - 1) = 0, and division by 0 is an undefined operation.  Select any other value for a to prove that the derived expression for p is is correct.  <br>  <br>  Let a = 4:<br>  <br>  p = 4/(1 - 4)<br>  p = 4/-3<br>  p = -4/3.<br>  <br>  Now plug our values for a and p into the original equation to see if a true statement results:<br>  <br>  a/p = 1/1+p<br>  4/(-4/3) = 1/(1 - 4/3)<br>  (4)(-3/4) = 1/(-1/3)<br>  -12/4 = (1)(-3/1)<br>  -3 = -3<br>  True<br>  <br>  The equation balances, so our expression for p is correct.

But I always thought standard form was:<br>  (y - 2) = 7 (x - 1)<br>  <br>  But go with the majority, I'm probably thinking of the wrong form.|`|XpWjdPg2aa	y=7x-5
I7hu3H4jaa	You are smoking some serious crack.  Most of the schools you list require a 3.8 or higher to get in.  Your only possible hopes are American and Penn State.|`|hMSVmJN5aa	come to gwu..if  you got $$$ youre in|`|CgOs2ViPaa	eh, i hate to tell you this, but you aren't really in a position to get into many of those schools. a 3.37 GPA is actually pretty low for most of those schools and your extra curriciulars arent that good in the way that you dont have much leadership positions. (fyi, the nslc thing really does nothing for you in regards to college apps and not to mention that its $$$$) <br>  and do you have 122 hours of community service throughout high school? or just one year. because 122 hrs throughout 3 years is honestly not that much. when you think about it its really only about 40 hours a year. <br>  and i dont think your cousin going to cmu is going to help you in admissions. im pretty sure its only just if youre a legacy. <br>  <br>  and since you live in texas, its a LOT harder getting into UCs just because they are state schools. i think you should lower the bar a little in regards to your standards for schools. i dont want to be mean but honestly, you cant get into stanford with a 3.37 GPA. i think the reasonable colleges on your list (assuming you get 2000+ on your SAT) are penn state, american university, and maybe bu|`|SqAsjK0Qaa	You've got pretty outstanding credentials outside of school. But, honestly, with a 3.37 GPA, it's a real stretch for you to get into NYU. You're clearly taking a lot of challenging classes, but that really won't impress the colleges since you didn't get very good grades in many of them. Sorry. There's a lot of smaller schools that would probably be more than willing to give you tons of scholarships due to your large amount of volunteer work and so forth.
