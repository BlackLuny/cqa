20090202131653AA7URCW	Food & Drink;Beer, Wine & Spirits	Gluten free cake mix consistency?	My mother in law's birthday is today and I am making her a cake that is gluten free b/c she has celiacs. I bought two cake mixes to make a double layer cake. I poured both in and mixed them with whatever was on the box but x2. It called for 1 cup of water so I added two. I don't know how it normally turns out b/c I have never cooked gluten free before but it seemed a little runny when I mixed it all up. I have it baking and it has been in for a long time, but it doesn't seem to be baking at a normal pace. Any suggestions? tips? advice?   ALSO right next to the mix was a gluten free frosting mix.I got it to go with the cake but now that I am thinking about it, aren't most frostings gluten free anyways? just a bunch of sugar and butter w/ flavorings?

I used to be able to take quite a few shots and drink a few mixed drinks and put them down without a problem. Then one night me and my girlfriend got pissy drunk and we had a really good time. We kind of went over board and ended up throwing up and having a really bad hangover. Now the thing is ive thrown up and have had hangovers before from drinking, but now even after just 1 mixed drink im nauceous just smelling the next drink. I want to be able to drink and enjoy myself in moderation but now i cant even drink without feeling nauceous after even one drink. Any ideas?      The night i got really messed up i drank ... Alize, Hennesy, Bacardi Grand Melon, Hypnotic, UV Blue, and Bacardi Hurricane. (It seems like alot but it was over the course of the night and it was only a few shots of each)      Im not an alcoholic so please dont come at me with the alcoholism talk, im well educated and know the limits that make it unsafe and im a casual social drinker not an everyday thing. Its once every 1 or 2 month i drink.      Thanks

Budweiser ,Coors and miller are way better then any of the expensive beers in my opinion so if I think there great and alot of other people think there great then how can anyone say they are "crap" beer as if there lacking quality in some way? i dont understand this "discrimination" in beer preference, people like what they like . what makes Bud a "crap" beer?
