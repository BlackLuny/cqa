20090219205059AArq1g6	Sports;Basketball	Dwight Howard is the best man to play since O'Neal, but he puts up Hakeem Olajuwon stats, future H.O.F.?	Do you see him a future Hall of Famer if he can keep these type of numbers up. I'm going to tell you head on the table. My favorite player is Dwayne Wade. I notice other talent, especially at the big man position because it's lacking. You say..."What the hell?!?! The big man position isn't lacking in the league!" Oooohh, contrare Mon Frare! LOL It is! I came up during the Era of Moses Malone, Abdul Jabbar, and later I witnessed so many Great...not just good....but GREAT centers in the league of Patrick Ewing, David Robinson, Hakeem Olajuwon, Alonzo Mourning, Shaquille O'Neal, Dikembe Mutombo(Defensively and Rebound wise...I give him enough to be credited a star player, he could score at times too.) The center position was deep like the 1996 NBA draft had stars, or the 2003 draft had stars. Plus, what do you think was the best draft the 1996 draft or the 2003 draft? So many stars in each draft.

While the West usually had the faster and more "skilled" teams (Red Wings, Avalanche for years). Yet, with all the free agency and big trades that have happened within the last 5-6 years I really believe that this is an old concept. The bloodbaths and the old school rivalries now exist on both sides of the country, which is simply great to see as all fans are able to experience a different kind of hockey game in and game out.

20090219212502AA751Ef	Sports;Basketball	PED's in basketball?  Your thoughts?	I know there's been a lot of talk in sports, especially baseball, about the use of performance enhancing drugs, mainly steroids, and I just was wondering what all of you thought about it in terms of basketball?      Now, while the NBA does test for steroids, and the benefits of steroid use don't necessarily benefit a basketball player the way they do baseball players, it got me to thinking about other PED's.      Specifically, I wonder how many NBA players have used a substance like EPO.  Its a drug generally tied into heavy endurance sports like cycling, but if you think about it, basketball is kinda an endurance sport.  I mean, with all the running back and forth, I could see players wanting to improve their endurance.  More endurance means you're playing at 100% for a longer time, you get tired less, you have to sit on the bench to rest less, therefore you're on the court longer and more opportunities to score and pad other stats.      Now, I'm not accusing any NBA players of using EPO, but if you look at baseball, with all the players that supposedly did steroids, its hard to think that one whole league can be corrupt while another would be 100% squeaky clean.  With the high level of competition in the NBA, would it surprise any of you if some of your favorite players were using PED's of the type that would benefit an NBA player?  The NBA tests for steroids, but they do not test for EPO, so they could easily get away with it.  What are your thoughts?

20090219211704AAgNoBC	Sports;Hockey	Lord Stanley's Hardware?	Give me you winner and why? ( no simple "duh" or because") people take pride in your teams, give them the respect to win. I'm a Flyers' fan through and through but I'll go on a limb and choose San Jose, I know they're the leaders of the West but I never really believed in the seeding, because as the second season goes there are no seeds, just the power of the hockey gods.    Yes, they have the great offense and defense, netminding is superb but, getting deep in the playoffs requires the right mix of grit and bonafide leadership. Blake and Lemuix will be huge for them down the stretch, Blake for his knowledge and Leumix to get in and mentally wear the opponent down. Certainly, they'll need the right bounces from the Hockey Gods (say your prayer to Belivue, Richard, Howe, Orr, Hull, and Sawchuck, why you ask that because I chose them) and they could be hoisting Lord Stanley's mug come next summer. If not my semi religious explanation of how to pick a cup winner is simply wrong.    Have fun with it, break em down and give me the reason (little guys not well known) and I'll see which one is best.

20090219214816AAb5mB6	Sports;Outdoor Recreation;Hunting	I'll spend around $1500 for a rifle n scope setup for hunting deer, elk. Any ideas for make and best caliber?	I'd like to know what caliber really offers better ballistics at longer ranges for some of your bigger game animals as well as reliable and accurate makes which offer excellent quality. I am also looking for the best all around caliber/gun for these various animals. One that will handle some of the bigger elk, moose etc and still not be overkill for deer etc. I've looked at remington 700 series but I really don't know what else I should be looking at within about the 1k range? I am a birdhunter new to big name and need some expert advice maybe someone with extensive knowledge in this field who may guide or has ++ years in the field. As far as the scope, please include recommendations for the size magnification and make. I have researched some and read various reviews from online sources and retailers. I just can't seem to find consistent advice on this subject, So  I'm hoping this might help. Willing to spend a little more if it makes a difference for either rifle or scope.

I think we should keep Kirk and get rid of those scrubs such as Duhon who is already gone. Shannon Brown, Nichols, and JamesOn Curry. That way we can keep Kirk who is a excellent defender and would be a great backup point guard. No team has a backup PG like Kirk. Unless if you count Barbosa. But yeah the lineup would be:      Rose/Hinrich   Hughes/Gordon   Lu/Noc   Gooden/Thomas   Noah/Gray      11/12 players can be Sefolosha who can play the 1, 2, and 3. Cedric Simmons seems to have a solid build. I think he has potential like Tyrus. Ced is 6'10 so he can play the 4 and the 5.      *KEEP CAP'N KIRK*

20081031133338AA4EQAb	Sports;Football (American)	Why does Big Ben get sacked so often? Is it his offensive line or his offensive coordinator or is it him?	Despite playing behind a reworked line, Steelers QB Ben Roethlisberger is holding up so far. The question is whether he can hold up under nine more weeks of regular season pounding like what he's gotten so far, including Week 9 at Washington. Roethlisberger has been sacked 23 times and is on pace to go down 53 times, which would tie Cliff Stoudt's 1983 club record. In the last 2.5 seasons, Roethlisberger has been sacked a remarkable 116 times; only Jon Kitna (129) has gone done more times, according to STATS, Inc. The poundings go on and on for Roethlisberger, who has been sacked three or more times in four games this season, including a season's high eight against the Eagles. The Giants sacked him five times and put him to the turf twice as many times as that on plays he wasn't sacked.

Lets take a look at why that is.  and also do u agree wit me or not and r u gunna buy the game or not gunna buy the game      1. The roster looks ok but they have some guys in there that didnt even have a good wrestlemania match never the less a mania match for instance they have Arn Anderson and Michael PS Hayes now can u guys remember any of their mania matches thats becuz they never had one jesus wwe come on. Ull have these wrestlers but not the Macho Man Randy Savage or Ricky the Dragon Steamboat  you got to be ****** kidding me Vince ur a ****** idiot cant wait to see how this game goes.        2. Also if u havent noticed there is no referees uhm i dont recall not having referres in the first 15 wrestlemania another wtf is going on       3.  Rock and Stone cold? why wud they put these guys in and not put legends that deserve to be like Randy savage ricky steamboat george the animal steele atleast put in Sycho sid he was in two good mania matches wrestlemania 8 and 13 both superstars faced in the game but we put in HHH not the game but the conneticut blue blood uhm lets think he only faced warrior at WM 12 and it was a squash match

I have my WSI, LGT, and CPFRO and keep them current. I have been on swim team since I was six and and am on a swimming scholarship to my college. I just started teaching here and at the end of my last session a woman came up to me an wondered if I would be interested in teaching private lessons for her and her friend.       I talked to some of the people that I used to work with and they all seemed to agree that $25 per half hour lesson is pretty typical. And then to add $15 for the friend. To me, that sounds like a lot, don't get me wrong, I would love to make that much money but I just don't want to rip off anyone.      Anyone have any experience with this that could give me some insight, thanks.

I have long dark brown hair. it is REALLY thick, so it takes about 5 layers to perfectly curl my hair. my hair is super wavy underneath, but on top, its poofy and frizzy and straight....ish.....when i curl my hair for a school day, it falls out by 4th hour, and i just curl the top. whenever theres a event that i want my hair all curly for, i ask my sister to do it. she curls hair in some way which i cant do (although we do it the same way), she hairsprays each section and for some reason it looks great and stays in. also the next morning it was perfectly soft and wavy.    i wash my hair every night, and it does not dry fast at all..sometimes an hour. i also can not blow dry my hair, the women in my family can not or else our hair looks like a cotton ball.      tomorrow about 30 minutes after i get home, my friend is picking me up because for her bday were going to a resort for the weekend, and i want my hair to be curly, so in the morning, im getting up early to curl all the layers. i know it wont stay in, so can anyone help wth ideas?? i can also not ask my sister because she leaves about an hour earlier than me.      thanks me love<33

20090203112250AAwNnTB	Sports;Wrestling	Does Randy Savage get the recognition he deserves?	I've seen alot of Savage from the 80's and early 90's, and i dont feel he gets the recognition he deserves. Yeah, he was a little unusual, mapping down everything before matches, but he DID put on some great matches. He made Hogan and Warrior look like world beaters. He could cut promos, i actually have his "Macho madness...ooh yeah, it's more seductive than sex" promo on VHS, lmao, which i bought online, along with several other of his matches/promos.       But, the guy is awesome all the same, but he did have to work with some stiff Wrestlers, and in mid-card. He did what was right for the business though. He went from i think it was headlining Wrestlemania with Hogan, to tagging with Sherri, in a stupid match against Dusty Rhodes - lets not forget he did the job to Ultimate Warrior (warriors best match btw) and then he went on to have a great match against Ric Flair.  His fueds with Jake Roberts and Diamond Dallas Page are so underrated from what i've seen, and he could Wrestle circles around Hogan.       I can go on, but i think you get my point. Savage was arguably, one of the best in the 80's and 90's, i just dont think he gets the recognition by the fans, that he deserves. Some recognise him, but plenty dont.      Your thoughts?      Thanks.

20090219210900AACclZ9	Sports;Other - Sports	Should a junior be a high school sports team captain?	A junior is currently our baseball team captain but, from what I've been hearing from other girls' gossip, team's not liking it too much. On top of her being a junior, she runs the stretching and warm-up exercises strictly and is hard on those who slack off in the slightest (because their muscles are already so strained and tired). She's been called a "nazi" and that's not the worst of it.      There are couple of seniors on the team who are just as good of players as her, if not better. They kind of are captains as well, but it's mainly the junior who's taken over things. The seniors don't want to bring it up with the coach because he had to deal with drama over who should be team captains last year and has a lot going on right now. They're not too happy about it either.      Is it right that she's a captain? I've always thought that spot is reserved for the best senior team player(s). I just want to know if having a junior as a captain is normal.

I'm pretty sure it's a fastpitch team, but it isn't specified. Up until about the age of 9, I played in my towns league, and i want to try to be on a sport, and this is the only spring one I have some experience in. When I played, I was always rotated between outfield spots. I don't know what I need for the tryouts, because our league lended us everything but our gloves. Do I need my own bat and helmet? If so, what type and size bat is good? And would would a 12 inch baseball glove suffice for tryouts so I don't have to invest in a new glove incase i'm cut? Other than those essential things, what else do I need, i.e., cleats, knee protection (i remember some girls in the older league used to wear knee/thigh pads), or anything i'm forgetting. And if you have any advice for me to practice ground ball, throwing, and batting (i'm going to a batting cage this weekend) everything is appreciated!

On tonight's analysis after the game, RDS experts, Michel Bergeron, Jacques Demers (both former NHL coaches), Bob Hartley (NHL coach) and Norman Flynn (ex Junior coach I think), said that a really bad news would make ink flow like it never been seen.      They were talking about Montreal Canadians' players, three of them, and something about drinks or parties. But it wasn't a fight or something stupid like that. It appears to be so serious. They mention, and I state: We are not allowed to give further infromation. Watch tomorrow news.      It must be so bad for a channel not to repport the news affraid of missing info and getting wrong. This is the very first time I see Montreal Channel cutting a news about the Habs, letting the slippy hill side to other channel. And believe me, here it is IMPOSSIBLE to miss a news about hockey. If Carbo ask Muler for a hotdog on July 25th at 8pm, we know it. If Bob Gainey talks to a player, we know it. If rains bothers Saku on a trip, we know it before he actually does himself.

20090219213213AA894Yv	Sports;Basketball	WNBA vs. NBA - This is for all the WNBA bashers.?	This is for all of you who bash the WNBA. I would rather watch the WNBA before the NBA any day. In fact I hate the NBA. The only good thing to happen to the NBA was Michael Jordan. If you want to compare the WNBA to the NBA first lets talk about defense. No one in the NBA plays defense. The NBA is just a big dunk fest with a bunch of guys playing for the name on the back of the jersey and not the one on the front. Women in the WNBA actually work hard for what they have accomplished. Women basketball players play basketball for the love of the game and because they have heart and passion. Men play just to show off their dunking ability and lack of defense. And people who say watching the WNBA is boring are crazy. If you want competition watch women sports. And stop being male chauvinist pigs.
