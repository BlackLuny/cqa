Well out of the blue, something is wrong. I click on view wireless networks and pick the available one (which is usually the library since that's where i spend most of my time) and it says connected, excellent strength, yada yada yada, but when i click the internet icon to get online it brings up that "page cannot be displayed" or "page unavailable" screen. I've tried reinstalling the driver and it says that its already installed and working properly but for some reason the internet page wont come up. Also i cant get a stable connection to boot up llimewire either. I'm thinking i may need another wireless card or maybe i messed something up in the settings...have no idea. But if any of you know of anything i should try, all helpful responses are appreciated and if i do  need to get another wireless card..where can i buy one and how much do they usually cost?

I swear I've seen this work before in database spreadsheets that I've inherited. Grrrr.      I created an Excel database that contains formulas within the database.  Sometimes a new database row needs to be created in the middle of the database.      Currently, after inserting the new row, I copy the formulas from the preceding row and paste it in the new row.  That's not too difficult, but I am creating this database for someone who is technologically challenged and I need to minimize how many steps she has to go through to maintain/update the database.      Having her copy the row and insert the pasted cells won't work because...well, she's technologically challenged and this would only serve to confuse her even more.      Isn't there some way that I can set up an option on the spreadsheet so that any inserted rows will automatically include any formulas that are on the preceding row?      Thanks!

I have recently installed an 8400GS 512MB NVidia GeForce Graphics Card (PCI Slot) to my computer, and I cannot play the SIMS 2 Double Deluxe. The game ran before without the graphics card installed, but at a choppy pace. I can press play and then it takes me to a black screen with a movable mouse pointer and Task Manager registers it as "Running" but when I close it in Task Manager I then get this message from the game:      Failed to find any   DirectX 9.0c compatible    graphics adapters in this    system! Please make sure   you have a DirectX 9.0c compatible   graphics adapter and have   installed the latest drivers provided    by the manufacturer. The   application will now terminate.      I checked numerous forums online and found this is a common problem for this game regardless of the Operating System, or Graphics system you are running.      This is not the first time I have had these problems with EA products, and it is not indigenous to the computer or OS in question. I think EA just needs to learn about this thing called BETA testing before they release a product.      Anyway if anyone has any idea lemmie know.      Here is the complete list of things I have tried.   1. Basic User Installation of both the game and        the sound card.   2. Reinstallation of both the game and the card   3. Updating the drivers for the card from their        website.   4. Installing updates for the game   5. Running the game as the Administrator   6. Downloading DirectX 9.0c from the        Microsoft Website and replacing the existing        DirectX file.   7. Making registry tweaks as indicated by various         forums   8. Ensuring that the DSETUP.dll was placed in        both the system32 fiel under Program Files       and withing the DirectX folder.

20090205135150AAfcIUN	Computers & Internet;Software	A Solidworks question?	Three years ago, I was given, by a friend who had purchased it originally from a licensed distributor for use in his business, an installation disc of Solidworks 2000.  He had closed doors, and didn't need it anymore.   Shortly after that, I installed it on my desktop PC to use for my own private (non-business) purposes, designing doll houses for my daughter, and dog houses for me.  It worked perfectly, no problems.   My PC has crashed, and I am trying to install the program on my laptop for more hobby projects.   Although I am using the correct installation codes and serial numbers, it won't install correctly and it keeps giving me, when trying to open a new "part" modeling shell, a pop-up message saying some thing like "This version of Solidworks hasn't been adequately serviced.  Check with your administrator."     What is the problem, and how can I make the installation "take?"   What am I doing wrong, or not doing right?  Thanks!

20090205135933AARO3Ex	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	Type Equivalence Policy of C++: Program languages employ either name, structural, or a combination of both as?	Type Equivalence Policy of C++: Program languages employ either name, structural, or a combination of both as their type equavalence policies. This program helps you to understand the type equivalance policy that C++ applies for struct data type. Here, both P1 and P2 are structs. Both have two integer data components. Thus, structurally, both P1 and P2 are equivalent.      #include    using namespace std;   typedef struct   {    int age;    int ssn;   } P1;      typedef struct   {    int phone;    int numberOfSiblings;      }P2;      int main()   {     // p and q are P1 type instance. Thus, both are same type (name).      P1 p; //------1     P1 q; //------2     q=p;  //------3        /* p1 and q1 are different types (names) even     if the structure of the both p1 are q1 are the same */       /*        P1 p1; //------4     P2 q1; //------5     q1=p1; //------6   */      return 0;   }   Type the above C++ program and compile it.       Then, uncomment lines 4, 5, and 6. Try to compile the program. What is the error message you are getting?      What can you say about the type equivalence policy of C++ for structure data type (structural equivalence or name equivalence).  Justify your answer based on the outcome of part 1 and 2 above.

So I bought a 6-pin to 8-pin converter and attached it to one of the 6-pins and plugged the 8-pin side into the graphics card, along with the other native 6-pin.      Now, whenever I play a game, a high frequency noise comes from my computer, almost like scraping a nail on stainless steel (I think it comes from the power supply). I know this is not good, and I'm wondering if it is because I am not giving the graphics card enough power.       A 6-pin provides 75 watts of power, while an 8-pin provides 150 watts. Am I only giving the graphics card 150 watts of power when it needs 225 since I'm not using a native 8-pin?       I know it's not that I don't have a large enough power supply... 800 watts is more than enough. Thanks for any help.

20090205150720AA77mTA	Computers & Internet;Computer Networking	I'm looking to set up a local web network via wifi?	Hi      I'm looking to set up a local network via wifi. That is, I want to configure a computer in such a way that, when they connect via wifi (or lan - it doesn't matter really), they will only ever see the web services running on that machine.      There will be no actual internet connection, only the services available on the computer - regardless of what they type into the address bar of their computer, for as long as they're connected to this machine, they will see the local stuff.      It's basically how pay-for-access wifi hotspots work - until you've been granted access by paying, you only see their local pages.      I'm sure this is fairly easy to do, my mind just won't fill in the blanks right now!      Any informed guidance would be much appreciated!

So i just want a PC with plenty of disk space, at least 4GIGs of RAM and with a good NVIDIA graphic card. that can even run Crysis all smooth =D (i won't play heavy games as Crysis but i want it to be really good) but that costs less than 1,000. And don't mention Alienware, they are too expensive...so any other choices? and how much would it cost?

20090205142518AAJ1dL1	Computers & Internet;Software	How can I replace a pirated version of XP with a real one?	About three years ago, my laptop crashed and a "friend of a friend" offered to fix it. I gave him my AUTHENTIC XP discs for renistall, but he decided to install a pirated version and return the discs to me, unopened.       At the time, I didn't know much about computers and just figured that he fixed it without needing the reboot discs. I found out that it was pirated about a year later when I attempted to update my operating system.      So, the question is this. How do I remove the BAD and reinstall the GOOD version of XP, which I have on disc, without starting from scratch? I would like to receive authentic updates, considering I have an authentic license.      If I do have go back to square one, I have all of my files backed up, but would lose my Office program because it was installed under the license of an old employer. That being said, it wouldn't be the end of the world.      Thanks!!

Or generally, can I run a Windows partition as a virtual machine from within another Windows partition (on the same hard drive if that matters)? I know it can be done from within Linux but that doesn't help me. Thanks.

So, using the Observer Design Pattern, we have to write a program that lets us create a collection of objects, each with two String properties: name and code. After the user has created a few of these objects, they can try to change the value for an object's code property.....however, no two objects in the collection can have the same value for code. If the object tries to change its code value to one that already exists, then a method, vetoableChange, doesn't allow the change by throwing a PropertyVetoException:           public void vetoableChange (PropertyChangeEvent pce) throws PropertyVetoException {      But the compiler is giving me this error that I don't understand:      vetoableChange ( java.beans.PropertyChangeEvent ) in Duel cannot implement vetoableChange ( java.beans.PropertyChangeEvent ) in java.beans.VetoableChangeListener; overridden method does not throw PropertyVetoException         So, can someone try to explain what the error means or what I'm doing wrong?      Thanks in advance! :D
20090205143334AAy8pj0	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	My Laptop is broken and I don't know what to do.?	My computer is only a few months old. We bought it at Best Buy and the first time me used it we heard something loose inside the keyboard. So we took it back to get it fixed. They said it was the motherboard. They kept it for about a month and half. They called us back to pick it up. When we did my husband was making sure there was nothing else wrong with it before we took it home and the Wireless button fell right off when he just barely touched it. So they took it back in to get it fixed for another month and half. When we went to pick it up again it was my mom and I this time. I tried to check everything before we took it home, But when we got home I double checked again and the right side frame to the screen was broken. They said they can't do anything about it and Gateway won't touch it unless we fix this problem first. Since we bought it, it spent the whole time at Best Buy and the can to have more problems than what we had at first. What do I do?

20090205145629AA7HSZL	Computers & Internet;Computer Networking	Do wireless internet routers have different power strengths?	We recently signed with Comcast for wireless internet service in our home.  We have a basic (I'm sure ) system.  The modem is a D-link DCM-202 and the router is a D-Link WBR-1310. We have one computer rather close to the units which always has excellent signal strength.  Our 2nd computer is on the floor above and about another 15' away horizontally and has sporadic service at best; but usually no signal.  Our house is frame, etc. without anything other than normal framing, plasterboard, etc. obstructions. We had one success with switching the CAT 6 cable from LAN to WAN; but again, it no longer worked.  The computer upstairs is a pc with a wireless card; the unit that always works is a laptop.  When we take the laptop to the upper floor, it also loses signal. I hope for any suggestions; and thanks in advance.

20090205144608AA9ZLyj	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	Help with beginner Java?	Hey,      I just started learning Java the other day, and i was wondering how to use if statements.      See i have this code, and it asks a question, i used             c.println ("\nWould you like to see a rectangle? \n If Yes press 1 if no press 2");           int ans = c.readInt ();           int a = 1           int b = 2      Now i want it to be that if a person presses 1 this happens:           c.println ("\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Here's your rectangle! ");               c.setColor (Color.blue);               c.fillRect (500, 0, 100, 100);      and if they press 2                c.println ("\n\n Ok then, see you later! ");      So could someone please tell me how to do it, and i am in grade 10, and i started learning java about 3 days ago in school, so i dont know a lot of java, just the very basic, so dont get too complicating :)      Thanks

20090205124614AAqP40l	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Other - Hardware	Hard Drive Failure or did computer crashed?	Do I have a hard drive failure of did my computer crashed?      I have an HP laptop with Windows XP.    Yesterday afternoon the computer was working fine.    Later in the day I turned on the computer from standby. Two minutes into using the computer, it restarted itself.   After it restarted, I was able to use Windows again for about 2 minutes and it restarted again.    So I am only able to use my computer for 2 minutes and it restarts.      On some restarts, there are lines on the monitor (don't know how to describe this). It doesn't show up on all restarts.      I tried to do a quick-restore by inserting a quick-restore disk. However, it only went to a certain percentage and the did not progress further. I've tried this several time and it always stops at the same percentage.   So I took the disk out and inserted the operating system CD and the computer seems to be trying to install the operating system but it also did not progress too far.      What makes me think that this is a hard drive failure rather than a crash is the fact that when the computer is turned on, the Windows XP or HP logo screen shows up (the screen that prompts you to enter F2).      My computer is password protected so I have to sign in at the Windows welcome screen. One thing I've noticed for the past month or two is that sometimes when I start my computer and sign in, Windows would just stay on the wallpaper and would not load Windows (iconds, taskbar, etc.). So I would have to turn off my computer and start it again for it to work.      Do I have a hard-drive failure?

20090205120519AA2R9Hi	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Other - Hardware	My computer runs very slow and its clock is behind?	My computer runs very slow and its clock is behind?   Hi all Just a few days ago I sent a question here asking how I could get a free software antivirus to replace one(McAfee) I had on my computer(Dell Inspiron 1501 Windows Vista) before which was about to expire. I installed both Avast Home Edition and PC tools Firewall on my computer. But my computer started running slower than before and although I have made all I know to set its clock on time now after a week it is already 2 minutes behind the actual time. What is the purpose of an antivirus/firewall software if it makes you computer run at snail's pace every time you tun your computer on? Even while I am typing this text at times the pointer disappears and I can't not longer see the chararacters on the screen. When I click on an item( weblink a window or icon) it takes a long time for the action to be performed. As for the clock I have tried almost everything I was told to: I have sent the computer back to Dell and they changed the CMOS battery, after I spent hours on the phone with their skillfull and kind technicians to fix that problem I have connected to a time server, I have set manually my computer on time from the toolbar etc. Still, the computer runs behind everytime I switch it off and turn it on later. In response to my previous question someone told me I might be infected by a malware, but how could I know which one it is and get rid of that without having to format my hard disk. Many thanks to all beforehand

But there's one detail I can't get my mind around.      The idea behind the program is to take the "orders" of each "customer."      There are two "while" loops running: one for the customers, and another for the items.      For example, one of them is while (anotherCustomer).      My question is, how do I get the program to add up the number of times the anotherCustomer loop was run and display it as something such as, "Total Customers today: Customer#"      Help is greatly appreciated.  Thanks, guys...

20090205104110AAMrBwq	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	Where could i find a certain website?	This website was shown on the news last month and it's a website where you could get actual celebrity autographs online. But, it's different from any ordinary celeb autography. The celebrities themselves, get on a web cam and whatever you want them to say they'll say it.      I want to get my mom a celebrity autography (Benecio Del Toro) and have a script for him to say for her birthday and then have one of my dad's favorite celeb crushes do the same thing.      Only problem is i can't remember the website. I think it was shown on KATU (which is Oregon's local news station so other's may not have seen it).      So if anyone can help me out with that you will get 10 points and mucho appreciation.      Thanks.

20090205145448AAe3kTv	Computers & Internet;Security	To block or not to block Jess ;P ?	"Jess ;P" (refer to my network fan) just joined my network by adding me this week his acct. is new Feb.1,2009, in less than a week he's got like 55 ppl w/in his network and only answered 3 questions and had asked only 1 question !!!!! I can't help but wonder if he's a "possible HACKER" ??   What do u think ? Should I block Jess ;P from my network ??      The reason I'm asking this is because this is my NEW official acct. and ONLY acct. I have no other "back up" Y/A like everyone else does here registered w/ my real info in which anyone who knows me can easily google me up and find out that I have an acct. here.   My last Y/A acct. here was HACKED into on August 8,2008 right in the middle of me of answering a question I was booted out and when I tried to sign back in the username/password was changed AND so was all the answer to my security q's and for 1 hr. unprivatized my q/a's and then put my questions and answers back into private again and left everything as I left it w/ my Q&A's set to private pretty much like I have w/ my current Y/A's acct. now.   Before my last acct. was hacked into on August 8, 2008 just before like a day, I had noticed the very same thing a person just added themselves into my network w/out them of ever answering/asking anything.   I just to share my personal experience and to advise everyone to be fully AWARE of who's adding themselves to your network and you have the right to be choosy who goes and who stays in, as well as have permision by e-mail to join.      Thank U      NOW back to question SHOULD I BLOCK "JESS ;P" from my network ????????????????????????????????????????...

20090205143140AAsUWC9	Computers & Internet;Computer Networking	FTP Connection Hangs at End of Upload?	Recently put my private home FTP server (FileZilla) outside my firewall so I can access it from the road.      For some reason, when I upload a file to it (FlashFXP or FileZilla), the file uploads completely down to the last byte. Then the client sits and waits for a while and then ultimately disconnects.      When I log into the server, the file is there and complete.      Is this a firewall configuration issue? I've forwarded the correct port and obviously I'm able to connect and start a transfer.      Any ideas?
