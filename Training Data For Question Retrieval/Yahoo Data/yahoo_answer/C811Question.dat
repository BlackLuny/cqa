These were seasoned but still came out clear and were very delicious.  Does anyone know what kind of noodles they were and what they might have been cooked in?

I live in south Texas where there are more Hispanics than whites and talks of "what are you giving up for Lent" are common. So are talks of abstaining from meat and only eating fish. I can't understand that rationale that if it dosen't walk on land it's not meat. That is how it has been explained to me. To me, if it's flesh (i.e. muscle tissue) it's meat and that includes fish.....  Help here?

I was thinking of making my kids "nuggets" today from these for my two picky kids. I was going to chop the zuccini and mix it with brown rice and bake it.       I am planning on making them into tiny patties, dipping them in egg and covering them in breadcrumbs and baking at 400 for a while. Will this work? What else should I mix in the mixture? Any tips from me for experienced moms and cooks?       I need to make them look like something my kids will eat. They are so picky and I'm desperate to get veggies in them:)!
