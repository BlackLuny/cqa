20070326145614AAC7v5r	Pets;Birds	What does it mean when my lovebird acts like this?	I have three birds; two parakeet and one lovebird. I've had the parakeets for about a year and the lovebird for about a half. None of them are very handtamed yet except one parakeet.      My lovebird constantly is talking with the parakeets and I've kept them seperated across the room. Ever since I got him though he's been bouncing around the bottom of the cage trying to get the parakeets attention. When I moved them closer I noticed he was trying to get out by fitting through the bars and actually managed to get his head stuck in one.      I can't tell if he is curious or wants to play with them. I'm afraid of putting different species birds in the same cage, especially since it's obvious the lovebird can really hurt a parakeet if it wanted to.      Does anyone know why he may be acting like this, how can I get him to stop, and if it's alright to put them in the same cage once in awhile?

20090205130600AA5K4Ce	Pets;Horses	EVERYONE!!! Ok I need help with showing my horse for the first time!!?	Ok here's the deal. I know where to stand when being judged. Anything else I should know? GIVE ME ALL YOU ANSWERS AND EXPERIENCE ADVICE. Thanks in advance. Also, my horse doesn't have a weight problem, but she is overly big, We have gotten her tested for slow metabolism, but the vet said, if anything, hers is fast. Will they dock me for this if I tell them? We have put her on a diet as well, we put her in a dry lot for 2 whole years, but she seems to get fat on air. Please help me! I want to show her. Also, she gets SO much exercise, so she shouldn't be fat, but she is. Also I'm thinking about showing my baby mule, she will be a year and one month by the time the show gets here. HELP ME! Thanks.

20090205132541AAqcVf4	Pets;Horses	Knee blocks or no knee blocks?	This is just more of an opinion deal than an actual question. I have a Crosby Sovereign and it is your typical old school Crosby, no padding, no blocks, nothing extra on it. I have been schooling 3'6 in it but recently I have been told that if I ever want to go higher, I must have a saddle that has knee blocks. I have always felt secure in my old school Crosby over fences, but what is your opinion on knee blocks? Love them? Hate them? Would never ride with or without them? All opinions welcome :)

I have tried rubbing unscented lotion, but that just seems to soften them. I've tried peeling everything I could off THEN applying lotion, nothing. I even went as far to use a face scrub, very gently, on her feet and it actually worked -but the next day her feet were peeling like crazy.      How do I fix this? I just want a solution that will at least be easy to keep up with and she is not going to find irritating.

You know how things all come in 3's?  Well I have SEVERAL aging pets, and I think that I need to have 2 of them put down.  Last year we lost one of our Cats to Cancer, and now another is exhibiting same symptoms, and I am BROKE.  Home is about to be in foreclosure, and I don't have $300 to have her "looked at" at the vet's office only to find out that she too has Cancer.  She's very old, and I think that she's about done.  Between that and the fact that I have a 18 year old whippet dog that is crashing on me right now (30% loss in weight in like 2 months, and all he wants to do is sleep, drink, and pee) I can't afford to spend $175 a piece to have them  actually put them down.  Any clues or help would be appreciated.    Sad times, but I can handle the pain, but I feel like my animals are suffering b/c I'm too broke to help them...

20090205142334AAYWa3V	Pets;Rodents	My brand new rat is pregnant. is it okay to leave her cagemate/buddy with her?	my boyfriend just got two very young rats from the pet store yesterday. they were only supposed to be "foster rats" for me to take care of for a couple weeks, until we were going to then give them to a friend for a permanent home.   however, one has a huge belly! i can't believe they sold him this one, she definitely seems pregnant. i'm concerned for her, because she is so young (she fits in the palm of my hand). she must have gotten pregnant right at 5 weeks, poor girl.   anyway, i already have 4 adult female rats in a separate cage/room. i had NO intention of introducing the new rats to them, i don't think they would enjoy new rats in their territory. like i said, the 2 young ones were only supposed to be fosters for a couple weeks.   but now that it looks like one of the little ones is about to give birth any day now (she looks like she swallowed a golf ball, seriously), i don't know what to do. is it alright to keep her buddy in the cage with her while she has the babies? they were housed together at the pet shop (they may even be sisters), and they sleep together, no fighting or anything. the other (non-pregnant) rat is completely docile. i don't have a third cage and like i said i don't want to put her in with my adult rats. any advice appreciated. i've never had a pregnant rat before, this is quite the strange accident.

It wouldn't be every day, and for dinner I'd still feed raw. The kibble is Taste Of The Wild and the canned is Wellness 95% Meat. (He only gets one spoon of the canned, it's just for flavor.)

20090205110430AACfYZD	Pets;Horses	Does this seem like a good foal?	I've ask a few questions about a paint/TB cross weanling colt and I emailed the owner and here's what she said.         He is high energy, like most foals. He is good on a leadline, stands, allows his feet to be handled, etc. He is VERY curious, which usually means very intellegent. That's good, but needs correct handling.   His sire is EXTREMELY mellow. (anyone can ride him, he loves children, and is a complete pleasure to be around)       His dam is an off-track race mare that won 5 races & over $50,000. As a result of her racing career, she is broke, but very "racy" and nervous under saddle. I've only ridden her a few times. She is not dangerous, but is really only broke as a race mare, that's all she's ever been taught, to run VERY FAST, gallop, etc. She's great in the pasture with other horses, is definately  the herd leader. She is very easy to handle on the ground, also as a result of her racetrack career, she does everything asked of her with no fuss.      We trail ride his sire (barn name "Duffy")   Don't ride his mom, her only career now is broodmare.      Duffy is 15.2   Libby is 15.3   Sunny is going to outgrow them both      He has never needed a vet      We usually geld in the spring, as soon as his testicles drop. I'm not sure if they're dropped yet.      His siblings are very gregarious (love people), very willing and great athletes....Barbie (Pepperd Diamonds) is a dressage horse and trail horse, Prince is in training for jumping, and Stormy is in training for a hunter.         What do you think?? Does he seem like he's worth it?? His price is $800      Thanks!!

20090205142623AAuNpUE	Pets;Horses	I am Scared to Canter! Help Please!?	Okai,, I have cantered before... just not on my new horse. I have a good seat at the canter and everything... so it is not like I am not experienced at itor anything. Just thought I oughta let you guys know that lol :)   I have already ridden him, but have only been allowed to walk and trot because our yard is too icy. I have only been walking lately because I am so scared that I will hurt his legs! I know that in the Spring, when you TRUELY bring horses back into work, that they can sometimes be a handful at the canter. Do you have any advice on making sure that the first canter of the Spring is controlled, safe, and enjoyable for BOTH horse and rider? I have a 16.3hh draft X quarter horse gelding and I am used to riding him. The reason I say this is because no matter what, his canter is always controlled. Because of this, I can just take off galloping in an open field in just a halter on his firsat ride of the spring and know that even if I completely let go of the reins, I will be safe. He is just a very controlled boy, and that is what I am used to. Since I have only ridden my new boy at a walk and trot, I don't know how to go about this. My first pony I had, she was a bugger when you first brought her back from the pasture, but you just had to ride through her excitement because she didn't know how to lunge. I was thinking of lunging him maybe, but I don't want to have to do that before every ride. Oh, and the smallest pen we have is wayyyyyyy to small to canter him in and is filled with trees. The pastures are just BIG HUGE and WIDE OPEN areas, so I am a little worried about our first canter together. There IS an indoor arena a couple towns over, but I don't have a trailer to get him there in. Do you think that I should get my trainer to come out and take him for a spin for me? I don't know... I would like to do it myself but I am nervous :S and I would ask his old owner to come out because she said she would come help me any time I needed it, but she just rolled her truck and isn't supposed to ride right now :( I don't know what to do! Would you please help? Thanks So Much To Those Who Answer!

How can I make this an educational experience for Crazy Train (the horse, also known as Ozzie) instead of a train wreck? (lol, no pun intended). I don't want this "should be fun" experience to just shoot down our confidence together :( Please help me! Also, any tips on grooming a partially white horse who is very dirty for a show? THANKS SO MUCH IF YOU ANSWER!!!

( i do this to teach her how to exit and enter her cage)      6. i started feeding her carrots and parsley along with her regular diet, is this too young?      7. is it a bad idea to move her around in different locations? should i keep her in one spot of the house (i.e. my room) to  let her get use to the surroundings?      8. she is not chewing on wood yet, should i be worried?         thank you again for taking the time to read this      cheers,   Gavin

20090205072044AADwrnR	Pets;Cats	How to stop a cat from constantly meowing?	About a month ago, my husband and I took in my childhood cat from my parents. He's a black cat, about 14 years old, and an absolutely freakishly loving cat. All he has ever cared about is being close to people and purring and petting. In all ways but one he is the best animal possible. His one flaw is that he meows... near constantly. I understand some of them- when he wants food, etc. But even when he is getting attention or after he's had food he still meows. I don't remember this happening when he lived with my parents. We've tried to spritz him with water only when he meows, but this doesn't seem to he helping at all. At one point I thought he might be deaf, but we've done multiple checks and he responds to sound. Any suggestions? We'd love to continue to keep him at our apartment, but he's driving us insane.

When we got her up she walked a little and went down again, and again... of course we walked for like two hours straight.  Anyway, had the vet come out.  He said she didnt look like she was stressed, normal resp. rate, no sweating.  He palpated and could not feel any impaction.  He gave her banamine and a sedative, and said she should be better.   Yesterday, same thing.  Only this time the vet let me pick up a shot of banamine to help her get through it.. .along with hours of walking.   This morning she looked fine but I am wondering what I can do to prevent it from happening anymore?      She has been on the same hay, same water source.  We are in western NY and it has been a very cold, hard winter.  The vet says he thinks she isnt getting enough water.  I started mixing bran and lots of water with her grain two weeks ago when our belgain was doing the same thing.

20090205122749AAL70wd	Pets;Dogs	How do you cope with putting a dog down?	*SIGH*      How do you do this? Our black lab has been in our family since she was 1 yr old and she’s aged quite a bit over the past few years. She’s now 12 years old and was diagnosed with cancer last year. They removed her tumor but couldn’t get all of it due to its location. We decided against medication and treatment due to her age, and promised ourselves we’d keep going until we saw she was suffering. Because obviously you don’t want an animal to suffer….      My mother and I were discussing our dog’s condition. And she’s lost 13 lbs since her last vet visit. She’s just slowed down overall and well, we think the time has come.      But we’ve both discussed how we will be able to do this. The vet said you have two options. The first is to drop your dog off and let the vet take care of things. Which we feel bad about. And second option is that we stay with our dog while they put her down. And well, I worry about that last vision of all of that. But of course if my mother wants to do things that way, I’ll be there right with her.       Have you had to do this before? If so, is it as horrible as I expect it to be? How did you cope during the process? And how long did it take you afterwards?      Thank you!

I put those blue toilet things in the tank to clean it, an my girlfriend left the bathroom door open an he drank some water. I'm not sure how much, but he's acting strange now....he wont respond to sit, come, lay down, go to bed, ect... he wont open his mouth, an he wont eat. He LOVES human food, an i tryed to feed him a piece of turkey, an he wouldent eat it. What should i do? Do you think he'll be ok? He is just sitting behind the chair, he wont come out...an he ALWAYS comes when i tell him to. He wont now though....should i give him ipicac or something?
20090205121350AA8K2gd	Pets;Dogs	How long should it take for my cardigan corgi puppy to be housebroken?  She is currently almost 6 months old.?	When she is in her crate, she knows not to go in there and can last easily 8 hrs whether we have gone somewhere or overnight.  Yet, when we let her out of her crate and she runs around the house, if we don't take her outside to urinate every 1/2 hour she will urinate on the carpet.  We are very good about remembering to take her out so that is not an issue.  We also we scold her when she urinates and immediately take her outside to her "spot" when she does urinate. We cheer her on when she goes outside as well.  Plenty of positive reinforcement there.  We have tried everything.  She did have 2 urinary tract infections already that have been treated with antibiotics.  We give her bottled water and Natural Balance dog food.  Any suggestions besides a possible deformity?  Our next step is to take her in for an ultrasound to look at that possibility but if it's normal for her to go like this, we don't want to put all that money and stress on her.  How can she last so long in the crate but not out of the crate? If she had a deformity, wouldn't she be urinating in the crate or at least crying to go outside at night time to urinate?

He will fall onto his back (submissive behavior), but then he will growl when you touch him("and show his teeth)? He also sometimes will growl when you pet him. We are not sure if this is normal for bostons, or is our dog showing aggressive behavior. We feel he may have some screws loose?
