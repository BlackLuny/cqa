zBr9MSY7aa	FIRST off if either of the two were to be nationalized it would be CITI (check balance sheet, illiquid compared to BAC), BAC is kicking off the next quarter with modest gains. If they were nationalized the GOVT would buy into the Common Stock and thus dilute shares bringing the value down (check FRE FNM) combine that with panic selling and you got a penny stock.  Common Stock holders are stuck with the daily value. If you hold CITI I would transfer it to BAC and buy under $3|`|Ch9TedMcaa	The government would take over everything. Investors get burned.|`|DSLlioPcaa	If any of the banks would be nationalized, the shareholders will lose the entire investment. There will not be any  compensation by the government for the common shareholders. However, the preferred shareholders will be compensated since the preferred shareholders are debt-holders of the bank instead of equity shareholders (common shareholders).<br>  <br>  If you own common shares of any of the banks you mentioned, find a good spot (the day DOW is up) and sell the shares since both the B of A and Citi are part of DOW companies.|`|jAg4AdbTaa	Currently both B of A and Citi are insolvent. In those cases, the government has the right to force them into bankruptcy discharging common shares, preferred shares, and bond holders  without compensation. This has been done 14 times this year already with smaller banks. This is nationalization.<br>  <br>  They have not done that so far with B of A or Citi because of the fear of causing systemic risk which could possibly bring down other banks. If nationalization was done for these banks, the government would probably not discharge some of the bond debt to reduce the systemic risk.|`|qxkk9xX4aa	The government would take full control of both banks wiping out shareholders. Doesn't matter what price you pay, you will not be compensated. There's no such thing as a risk-less investment. Buying these banks is a gamble right now.<br>  <br>  There are other stronger banks you could look to invest into such as J/P. Morgan who always happens to take advantage of a bad market.

(I was actually homeless for a number of weeks)  I kept expecting that the credit card companies would send over some thugs to break my shins, and to my surprise, it never happened.  Since nothing happened, I decided that I would rather go back to school rather than take a less skilled job to pay my debt.  Soon, I will actually pay taxes--a lot of taxes--because I will be working a much better job and my money will be going to the government rather than the dishonest credit card companies.  I am not responsible for the failing economy since I didn't pay my debt.  Its actually the large corporations that make stupid risky moves trying to get rich quick off people who really shouldn't have been given the credit cards in the first place (like me). <br>  <br>  I know it may be hard to believe, but I am not the only person out there who has done this or feels the same way.  It's just that people are afraid to say anything because of the stigma that is associated with it.  Well, I am saying it:  I stopped paying my credit cards and I am happy for it.  So, to the person who said you won't be the first-- fear not, it has been done!  <br>  <br>  If any of you who are reading this, wondering if it really can be true, that someone can survive and even thrive and not pay their credit card bills--check out the site below.

9dvmMRX4aa	Yes you can try to get a loan but now with the economy as it is I'm not sure you'll get one|`|Q7WC6R0saa	maybe you can, but you might not want to start it in the U.S. there is a really bad economy going on and it's not just the right time. And you prolly won't be able to get a loan. i suggest you get a job like working as a manager, then when you save enough money to put a down payment THEN get a loan is when you should do it. i hope that helps.|`|e189bba5b241ab836b0109844d09cabaaa	If you want to own a hotel, yes, you need to have excellent credit, a lot of funds or backers that have a lot of funds. 500,000 is a conservative estimate...depending on the hotel type you wish to own, it may be much more than that.<br>  <br>  Also, getting a loan can be difficult. Having a degree is a plus, but if you also need a comprehensive business plan, not just a simple I want to own a hotel statement. You will have to write your business plan and be very detailed about how you intend on running the hotel, who your clients will be, where you are putting the hotel. Also, they will look and see, do you or your potential business partners have either experience in the running of a hotel or the ownership of a business.<br>  <br>  If you don't have money or partners who have money...or you have no real practical experience, then constructing, opening and running a hotel will likely be out of reach.<br>  <br>  A more practical approach would be to use your degree to establish yourself as a general manager at an existing hotel. This will allow you access to all the financial information you will need to write your business plan and ensure you can raise enough capital to actually get your business up and running.|`|OqvMI3S6aa	trust me, right now it's a really bad time to get a loan with the economy and everything. and running a hotel  will take a lot of smart moves with people and also with the money.

The name itself should be suitable as long as your advertising shows what you can do. If you are looking to build a relationship with private, religious schools, the name may or may not hinder that. Some schools understand the marketplace and that the name does not imply intentions, some shy away, especially within a very religious area. My guess is, if you are in such an area, your business would suffer anyway.|`|rq5q34ERaa	You are right, if you plan to expand and possibly get contracts with schools and other sports teams especially with youngsters you should change your name. It really is a great name if you had planned to stay in the niche you are in now but expanding is a great idea and a name change will probably be necessary. I wish you the best of luck.|`|Y27ovMdRaa	Play it safe and just don't use the word "Killer" . . . especially when you're marketing to children.  That's a set-up for failure.

pb2WPKHoaa	First off do not dispute on line.  You need to write seperate letters to the credit reporting agencies.  You need to do this because online disputes don't give you the option to say that these are duplicate accounts|`|y4SUDnpaaa	Isn't it normal to see the same information on all your credit reports? It usually just means they are in agreement with what's shown on the other credit report? If it is showing two different payees then it is a duplicate. Call the credit bureaus and ask for corrected credit reports, follow up with a registered letter.<br>   FYI once the seven years has passed on collection accounts they  cannot be put back on for another 7 years.|`|e9303a5747e5a166625104cfb16d5c45aa	I had the same situation last week. The answer I choose was "This record contains multiple inaccuracies, please verify accuracy of all data"<br>  and in the box where you can add information I gave a brief description that the accounts were the same account. I've not been contacted back yet to see what happens, but makes sense to me.<br>  <br>  As a side note, in my state anything over seven years old is removed from your credit, so I wouldnt pay anything close to being 7 years old, as If you do it restarts the process over and remains on your credit another 7 years from the date you paid it off.

s87m8DoFaa	I'm not actually a lawyer (but I am studying law :P) so my advice doesn't have the authority of whoever else decides to post, but anyway...<br>  <br>  Your union should have legal counsel helping them (someone with strong knowledge of both contract law and employment law). That said, there are basic legal rights that all employees have, and (depending on the country your in) you can look up the relevant legislation free on the web (austlii is a good source of Australian legislation). <br>  <br>  Also its the job of your union to negotiate with your employers, and to get the best terms for you, and to help you understand your rights and responsibilities...if they're not doing that (your all worried about getting replaced) then perhaps you should think about telling them to sod off?

Since it's in the red, it doesn't sound like there is going to be a ton of competition to buy it, so you can really do your homework on it.  <br>  <br>     Figure out exactly what they are doing wrong.  Working yourself to the bone isn't going to be the only answer, but I like your work ethic.  Look into:  what they are doing to attract customers, what they are doing to KEEP customers, are the adding on additional items to each sale, are they having to earn each customer or are they coming from referrals, where are the customers coming from, and is there any competition and what are they doing?<br>  <br>      Do your research and draw out a business plan.  I would also look into SCORE and see what free advice you can get from them, and also look into your local Chamber of Commerce and see if they have any free classes going on.  Showing a solid, specific business plan that shows that the BANK is going to make money by lending you money to make money with the business is definitely going to help.<br>  <br>    Good luck!  ;)

That should help you get a job.<br>  Handle the application with care and fill it out completely and in your best handwriting...

The key to advertising is to Test and Measure whatever you are doing.  Think of 1 ad and put it in 10 different places.  Then take 10 ads and put them in one place.<br>  <br>      For example:  it's free to place ads on craigslist.  Put up 10 ads and see which one gets the best results.  Then take the ad that does the best and start posting that around.<br>  <br>     If you have a website, then make sure that your website is mentioned in EVERYTHING that you do.  On your myspace, your facebook, your signature to your emails, when you answer forums, and when you make comments.<br>  <br>    You need to find out where your buyers are, and that is where you need to put your ads.  It is also free to post on Youtube, so give it a shot!  You're not going to lose anything, so try all of these free things and see how the responses are.  After you get some responses and find the buyers, then you can start paying for ads.  But you need to figure out what works the best first!  ;)<br>  <br>  Good luck!

Yeah I got really bummed out, I had that job for nearly 20 years.  <br>  <br>  DON'T GIVE UP!!!!  <br>  <br>  Unemployment is not the ONLY option available to you.  You could get another job.  Try signing up with a temporary agency.  <br>  <br>  That's what I did, and I landed a decent paying temp job right away.  No, it doesn't pay as much as my former job, but I've revamped my budget; eliminated all the un-neccasary expenses, my bills are paid and there's food on my table.<br>  <br>  When this temporary job is over, I'll get another one from the same temporary agency.

With the dip in the economy the current owner may well be willing to part with the company for less than 50%. <br>  <br>  First, consult with an accountant and an attorney. Find out what the business is worth, not just what it is selling at. The worth of the business may be far less than what they are asking to be purchased at. Also, consider your own financial situation. If you do the things you propose and the business stops losing money, is the business truely capable of making a profit? Also consider the future of the company.<br>  <br>  With all these things, is the company for sale alone or are the company assest also part of the deal? Many companies sell during an economic slump, but some small companies assests do not belong to the company, but to the owner. This is where the lawyer is needed. Ensure that you aren't just buying a name and renting a place, but that the place has all the companies current equipment, if any.<br>  <br>  Past that, if you believe in your ability to make the company profitable, the absolute best time to expand a business is during economic slumps. If you can buy cheap and have enough capital to wait out the slump, the end profits can be high as many of the competing business will also sell or simply vanish.

By affordable, that means one paycheck a month is all you want to pay for housing. The rest of your checks will go to food, clothing, taxes and insurance. Multiply this by 15 years . That gives you  your price range. The bank will be looking for an investment from you called a down payment . 20% down is usually a good rule. Then go to your bank for a 20-30 year mortgage loan. Don't forget, you must plan to pay the interest on the loan, henceforth the extra time. Also build your credit with small loans, keeping them in savings at the bank you plan on using.

gaXUIduMaa	It is not Obama's fault but something he is doing is negatively affecting it.  The financial stimulus plan, not the one just passed but the one that we issued half of in the Bush administration.  In the first half of the funds, there was no accounting where the money went and it did not do anything to help restart mortgage lending industry as it was suppose to.  Now the banks expected that the second half was going to be given to them.  Instead, Obama decided to allow refinancing loans to be given to directly to individuals and bypassing the banks.  The banks are in trouble because they expected the new money and now know that they are going to have to show where the previous money went to.  Since the funds are not going to the banks, many of them and other money and securities institutions are tanking and bringing down the rest of the market.

You forgot to mention that in your arguments.  <br>  <br>  What folks are failing to realize is that this is an unprecedented foreclosure snowball, hardly caused by Obama.  If you don't put an end to it, most neighborhoods in the country will be lined with foreclosures.  Underfunded homeowners associations will mean less care taken of the landscaping/upkeep.  Inevitably, it's in everyone's interest to put an end to this snowball, somehow.  Helping out both sides, those that are paying on time, and those that got caught in the situation (without overbuying/irresponsibility) is a sensible idea.<br>  <br>  The BIGGEST group of forthcoming foreclosures are the option arms...they haven't even begun to scratch the surface.  There are neighbors of yours paying 1-2% payments, deferring the rest of he 6% interest on the back of their loan.  When that starts adjusting in 12-18 months, and the entire payment is due (instead of the 1-2% payment), there will be tens of thousands more foreclosures.  Again, these haven't even starting happening yet.  So, the neighbor is not only backwards from their original loan, they've been adding to the principle month after month.  How many of these folks are going to pony up another $1000/month on a $200k loan when they're so far upside down?

If your neighbor's can't pay their moragage then they'll be kicked out of their home...the house will be empty...no one will move in the house b/c no one can get a loan and afford it.  Your neighborhood will become more dangerous and negletated and YOUR home's value will go down.<br>  <br>  If you don't want to pay your mortgage try selling your home and see how far you get.

e83c5229e243a4223beeb3c6e55aac65aa	How to Sell on eBay<br>  <br>  Selling on eBay is as easy as going through a few steps. It's user friendly and can always be edited. Here's how you can sell on eBay. If there are any questions you can always go to the "Help" section of the site.<br>  <br>  Instructions:<br>  <br>  Step 1. Sign up. Assuming you haven't yet signed up yet, go to eBay's Main Pageand then click on register at the very top of the page to create an eBay account.   You will also need to sign up for a PayPal account.  Sign up for PayPal first, as it will take a day or so to complete the registration process for PayPal.<br>  <br>  Step 2. Build your account. It's a very good idea to buy a few things and pay immediately so that you will get some feedback ratings. (Don't buy things to resell, just buy things you'd buy anyway.) This will give you experience with the site and start to build up your "site cred". <br>  <br>  -Search eBay for items like those you want to sell. Read the listings. What sort of information or photos do you find most helpful to you as a potential buyer? What makes you think a seller is trustworthy? <br>  <br>  Step 3. Assemble the information you will need to place the listing. Usually this includes measuring the item, weighing the item so you can estimate shipping costs, and having your photos ready. <br>  <br>  Step 4. Log in and go to Sell either in My eBay or on the Main Page at the top. <br>  <br>  Step 5. Enter the title and description, after choosing a category. Be very detailed about your product, and include as many pictures as possible.  The more pictures, the better your item will sell.  Not including one will deter a lot of buyers from your item. <br>  <br>  Step 6. Continue to go through the options, and be sure to look everything over very carefully. There's a lot to look through and you'll want to make sure everything is correct.  Do not waste your money by opting for the "upgrades" for your listing.  In 10 years of selling, I have never upgraded any of my listings and have done great. <br>  <br>  Step 7. Double check everything before saving. Be sure that when you're done with everything at the end (you're at the overview page) to double check and press submit. If you don't press submit it won't be entered. You'll then get an e-mail confirming that your product was placed on eBay. <br>  <br>  Step 8. Watch the auction. Once the item has been shipped, and they have left feedback for you, you should leave feedback for that person. <br>  <br>  *Tips*<br>  <br>  -Consider using a photo hosting service to add extra pictures to your listing for free.  If you use the ebay photo hosting service, the first photo is free, each additional picture is .15 cents.  I use Seller's Sourcebook for all of my listings.  I can choose from over 1000 different auction templates, add as many pictures as I want and I can even upload my listings to ebay from the Seller Sourcebook site.   Every one of my listings look very professional and I am proud to show my items using a professionally designed template.  Other photo hosting sites are Inkfrog and Photobucket.  There is a charge for Inkfrog, but Photobucket is free.<br>  -You need to have excellent feedback to sell well on eBay. <br>  <br>  -Sell inexpensive items to build up your feedback first.<br>  <br>  -As long as you follow the directions and press submit at the end, your product will be viewable to everyone.   It can take up to 12 hours for your item to show up under the general search.<br>  <br>  -Always answer a customer's questions promptly. Be clear, direct, and friendly. <br>  <br>  -Be sure to choose the correct category and keywords... the easier it is for your customer to find you, the better it will sell! <br>  <br>  -You will have to ship the product out on your own, so you're going to have to add shipping into the price; there's a section where you set the shipping. <br>  <br>  -You can always go back and edit it if you don't like something. Just go into "My eBay" and go from there.   Once a bid in placed on  your item, you cannot edit any information in your listing.  You can add to the description, you just cannot edit the main body of your description.<br>  <br>  -Keep good communication with your customer - they're interested in your product and you want to be ranked as a good seller in the end, so be a good seller! <br>  <br>  -Try and have it so your auction ends on a Sunday. Avoid ending auctions on Friday or Saturday when people are not home to bid. <br>  <br>  -Avoid using "reserve price" auctions. These auctions are a form of shill bidding where the bidders are bidding against the seller himself. A reserve auction makes some buyers angry because they have no idea what the seller wants. Instead, set the opening bid at the lowest amount of money you would be willing to sell the item for. <br>  <br>  -Help keep the feedback system honest by only placing honest feedback and avoiding the "trading" of positive feedback. A seller should leave positive feedback if the buyer pays promptly. A buyer should leave positive feedback if the item arrives in a reasonable time and is as advertised. A seller who waits for a buyer to leave positive feedback is really trading feedback. Such a practice skews feedback ratings.  Also, realize that a seller cannot leave a negative feedback for buyers any more.  So, ensuring that your description in your listing is honest and you ship on time, will help you maintain a positive feedback rating and keep your 30 day DSR stars in good standing.<br>  <br>  -People will look at things that have cheap or free shipping, so include the shipping price in the total price (or min bid) and people will be more inclined to buy. If you offer it, make sure they know that you're offering it. <br>  <br>  -Packaging is also important. If items are fragile, improper packaging can result in broken items and unhappy customers! Also keep in mind the price you pay for shipping: the box, padding, etc., to decide on a reasonable price or add it to shipping and handling fees.   Also, consider the possiblilties that can happen to your package.  Rain, sleet or snow.  Will the item that you are sending get wet in the packaging that you are using?  If so, wrap the entire item in plastic to prevent this from happening.<br>  <br>  -Payment will be vital. PayPal is the only form of payment available on ebay, and as a seller, you will want to understand how it works and sign up.  A seller cannot advertise these payment options:  checks, money orders and cash.  If you advertise that you accept these thype of payments, ebay can and will shut down your listing.  Now, if a buyer writes to you and offers a money order or check, you may want to consider accepting, since you will save 2.9% plus .30 cents per transaction.  <br>  <br>  **Warnings**<br>  <br>  -Do not sell illegal items. Doing so can bring heavy consequences upon you. <br>  <br>  -Negative feedback can lead to buyers cautious of you and makes sellers think twice about selling to you. Follow up any negative feedback with accurate facts. Do not call names. <br>  <br>  -Be careful when sending feedback. You can be sued for making dishonest statements on the feedback page, so keep in mind that you are responsible for your remarks. Keep it honest and professional, and above all, don't make childish and angry remarks. <br>  <br>  -Don't overcharge for shipping and handling. A reasonable amount for your materials and effort is okay, but buyers don't want to pay $15.00 for shipping and handling and then see on the postage label that it only cost you $3.85 for shipping. <br>  <br>  -NEVER put the starting price lower than what you can afford to lose by selling it! You need to consider the fees eBay, Paypal (if you offer a PayPal payment) and shipping. It is entirely possible to lose money on an item if you put a starting price that is too low for you to at least break even if only one person bids on it. <br>  <br>  -Be careful of selling overseas. Most items are perfectly fine, and can increase your bidding pool. However, what may be perfectly legal in the US may be illegal in New Zealand, Turkey, or Japan (or vice versa). <br>  <br>  -If an item is worth a large amount, you may want to take into consideration using a reserve price. This can prevent financial loss. This may, however discourage buyers on bidding or purchasing your product.  I do not recommend to ever use reserve price, because why keep your buyers guessing at the minimu price of the item.  What I highly recommend is starting bid or purchase price at a minimum of what you want for the item.<br>  <br>  -Do not ever make the following statement on your listing:  "I will not be held responsible for any item that does not have insurance, after I have shipped the item."   The plain fact is that you (the seller) are responsible for the item that you sell to get to your buyer in the condition advertised, regardless weather the item has insurance or not.  If your item sells for a fairly high price, you may want to pay for the insurance yourself.  But, always advertise on your listings that insurance is available to your buyer.  Sometimes, they may purchase the insurance for you.<br>  <br>  Hope you'll find the instructions above useful and have fun selling on eBay|`|92gcQFTIaa	Go to ebay and read their information.  That's a lot of information you are looking for.  Also try to find someone you know and see if they can help you out.  I've helped out a lot of friends of family members on starting out.  It's better to start selling after  you've purchased a few items to get a feel for how things work.  Good luck.|`|570ae7b6a1f39074481fb68d4e1e7a4faa	1.- Open account with ebay (to sale items)<br>  2.- Open account with paypal (to receive payments)<br>  3.- Take picture of items you want to sale<br>  4.- List them on ebay, use calculate shipping cost tool<br>  5.- Wait (keep looking for things to sale, anywhere)<br>  6.- If it is sold collect payment<br>  7.- Ship item ASAP<br>  8.- No sale, start from # 4 again.<br>  9.- Keep listing items until you make you desired amount of money. <br>  10.- Good Luck.

You are only allowed up to six semester hours in each of the business subject areas, so the economics will count, but only for 6 hours.

The office was REAL busy and red bull seemed to do the job for a short while but she crashed and was "mopey". In other words the buzz didn't last that long and you crash as soon as it wears off.<br>  You're better off drinking cofee IMO.
4e8cd40d02dea72a780fb697201d9c7daa	At will employment basically means that your job is not secured and they can get rid of you "at will". Which means that they don't have to tell you verbally or send any notification, and don't need any two weeks or anything like that But keep in mind too, if he does good and keeps his nose clean, then the longer you're with the company that means that it will be harder to get rid of you. And it depends on the felony as well. And what they go by is the arrest record on the background. It won't go into detail on the arrest just the crime, charge and the date. So if it's a red flag he might have to explain to them what is going on so if he has his dispositon papers saying it will drop down he might want to make a copy of that because they might want proof. Girl, it's hard for someone with a record to get even the simplest job. And I think it's messed up because everyone makes mistakes but they need to make a living to pay for their fees but yet even if you do the time for the crime, they don't want to hear it.|`|AA11135351	"At will" means that either the employee can quit or the employer can terminate the employee for any reason without liability if there was no contract for a definite time of the employment relationship.  In other words... the employer is free to discharge the employee for good cause, bad cause or no cause at all.  At the same time, the employee is equally free to quit.   Hope this helps.|`|AA12178195	"At will" employment means that the company can terminate your employment at their own time.  If they change their minds about hiring your son, he gets fired.  <br>  <br>  COnversely, your son is not obligated to work for them any longer than he desires.  Of course, etiquette dictates that he give two weeks' notice before walking out.  <br>  <br>  Usually you are given a two or three month probationary period at any new job.  This is for the emplyee andthe employer to decide whether to continue the relationship.  If your son doesn't like it, he walks.  If your company doesn't like him, he walks.  Nor harm no foul.|`|07527bc8468917a254c01d461144bd4faa	They can fire you "at will".

But she brought me, I didn't bring her, and she used to live there as a child.  Groping is normal, from what I gather, although noone groped her.<br>  <br>  If you don't want your girlfriend to get groped, take her to a Mardi Gras celebration that is not so crowded, or among people you know.  Better yet, tell her "You can lift your shirt if you want, but if you get groped, don't come crying to me"  That way, she takes responsibility for her own actions.  Obviously, if someone takes it too far, you call the police.   If it was my girlfriend, I wouldn't let her flash if she was drunk, b/c then she is not in control of her actions, in other words, she needs a babysitter, but if she's sober, then she can flash all she wants.<br>  <br>  Needless to say, I dumped my ex for reasons besides flashing :)|`|AA11056696	No, I went with several male buddies on a trip years ago and we had a blast.

I've lived in california for my entire life and i have to tell you, its the land where dreams come true, and where dreams are crushed..  A thrift shop in my opinion is not a very good business in california.  Trust me if your just now trying to open one, your about 20 years too late.  Thrift shops make no money here.  The thrift shops that are still open in california survive because they bought property and opened there business a long, long time ago.  They can stay open because there mortages are very low and most likely they've retired from some type of career.  You cannot even rent a storefront for less then $1500 a month and they usually want 6 months in advance in california and that would not be a in a very pleasent neiborhood. Then the rest of your overhead, electricity, phone, insurance, actual merchandise.  I'm not trying to discourage you, i'm trying to prepare you, like i said i've lived here my entire life and know it like a book.  Yes i'm a native califorian 38 years young.  Just a heads up, people in california are about money, anything that has to do with money.  So if you sell expensive items or a product that looks like you have to have alot of money to buy it then your set.  Image is everything in california !!!!!!

It is designed to avoid paying taxes on company profit, distribute profit to shareholders/propriator/who ever and the you personal taxes on what you received from (your) company.  See IRS for information.<br>  <br>  LLC is a limited liability company.  It falls somewhere between a propriatorship and an incorporated business.  The former has you totally personally liable if something bad happens.  The later has no personal risk and only the company assets can be seized in an issue.<br>  <br>  License for store would come from the state, like registering your company name with the state.<br>  <br>  To make your day worse, do you have an EIN from the IRS.

1d2b0b278f8133220253adb5196932fdaa	Getting started in a new job is always tough.  Who can you trust?  Who can't you trust?  Do they like you?  Do you like them?  Is it a good fit?  Tough time!<br>  <br>  So, you need to relax a bit and understand a few things:<br>  <br>  1.  Your boss probably has known the assistant longer and is more comfortable with that person than with you, currently.  Hopefully that will change over time, but not if you are "piss off" which may show in your face or in your actions.<br>  <br>  2.  You are presumably getting paid more than the assistant.<br>  <br>  If the accountant post is new, they may not know what an accountant (vs. assistant accountant) can do for them.  So, you'll need to educate them.  Think of this as a process of helping them rather than competing with the assistant accountant.<br>  <br>  "If opportunity is not given," as you stated above, create your own opportunities!  Do something useful and valuable (and, maybe new) without being asked to do it.  If you are just sitting there at your desk waiting to be assigned work, that could be THE problem!<br>  <br>  Tell your boss what you'd like to do, ask if it's OK, and, if your boss says yes, then do it to the very best of your ability.<br>  <br>  A negative "piss off" attitude could really sabotage you in this situation.  Try to dump it or at least keep it out of site.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|AA12380246	Your boss has a level of comfort and trust with the other assistant accountant that you have yet to earn.  Don't be too hasty in your judgment.  Each company has their way of account management that the other assistant is probably more informed about.  You state that the "opportunity is not given".  You're not seeing the whole picture.  You have been given the opportunity by being hired.  All you have to do is stay there long enough for you to prove your worth.  Create your own opportunities. Ask for special assignments, suggest different flows or formats.  Do something that will benefit the company that the other assistant doesn't know how to do.

AA11189988	A lot of people go to college straight out of high school because they think they have to or it will slip away. And alot of them get a degree in something they hate.

dbd9ad4865e4c24644e3cc2466a837d4aa	In the first stages of preforeclosure. most times you can make a deal with either the owner or the bank without other "bidders".  If you wait for the actual forclosure sale, you have to bid against others, which can cost you much more.|`|3d7034f6f80ccb280be8fcf26d641dbbaa	The possibilities in negotiating a purchase of a preforeclosure are endless but they basically brake down into three separate areas:<br>  1.) You can approach the owner and have them sell you the property.<br>  2.) You can approach the bank and<br>       a.) have them sell you the note and you foreclose<br>       b.) have them sell you an option to purchase after they<br>            acquire the property<br>  3.) If all else fails then approach the owner and buy their, statutory provided for, right of redemption so as to avoid having to pay the inflated price when the bank puts the property back on the market.<br>  Buena Suerte|`|AA12257018	I do this all the time and I find it to be beneficial to both the home owner and myself if I buy it prior to the foreclosure.

In this environment, there will be a lot of foreclosures due to people not making payment on real estate that have designer mortgages, such as ARM, and interest-only mortgages.This is the perfect time to buy foreclosures because banks hate to non-performing assets such as REOs. Also, check with small banks, savings and loans, and credit unions and ask for their REO list.  Credit unions will be happy to lend you a list of their REO for their members to buy.|`|9038f0730f6872c9ac2acebe07158322aa	It is much better to buy before a house goes in to foreclosure|`|c2277822d1bb885c17ed7865710b96ebaa	Depends upon the situation.  For instance, if they owe $200,000 on a $500,000 property, that's a situation where it's probably better to buy from the owner.  If they owe $550,000 on a $450,000 property, that's a situation where you're likely to get a better bargain by waiting until the bank owns it, because they're probably not going to approve that much of a short sale, but once it's on their books they want it off.|`|AA10076123	either way they are desperate.<br>  the bank does NOT want to hold and manage the property<br>  so you should be fine either way.<br>  but like the first answerer said.. during preforeclosure, is a good time to deal cause people are thinking . oh my god what have i done?!

b0404ca8834c0976bd6577755ac27b00aa	1. What are your primary responsibilities?<br>  <br>  Writing program "code" is actually a very small part of my job.  A lot of time is spent meeting with clients to assess their needs and designing systems to meet those needs.<br>  <br>  I work for a small business, so I'm also in charge of keeping our systems secure and I do half of the system administration duties (keeping the servers up & running).<br>  <br>  2. How have you prepared yourself for your profession?<br>  <br>  I've been programming computers since I was 7 years old, so I've built up a lot of experience and understanding of how computers work.  I'd pick up books about programming when I was in junior high and high school and try to learn new languages on my own.<br>  <br>  I have a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and I'm certified by Sun Microsystems as a Java programmer.  Both of those took a lot of discipline and studying.<br>  <br>  3. What has been the most influential/significant experience you have encountered on the job?<br>  <br>  I used to carry a support pager and had to respond to problems at any hour of the night (usually between 2am-4am).  Nobody likes to be woken up at that hour because of something at work.  I learned a lot about dealing with grumpy people and getting them to work together.  I also learned how to get managers to understand why testing our software is so important, because if the program has a problem at 3am, THEY get woken up too!<br>  <br>  4. What are some rewards of your profession?<br>  <br>  The money is usually good, and tech companies usually offer lots of perks like flexible work hours and free food.  Mostly, I like the feeling of creating something that other people will use.  I like the idea that something I made will make someone else's life easier & more productive.  I've also had the opportunity to work with some really smart & creative people.<br>  <br>  5.how long have you worked professionally as a<br>  computer programmer?<br>  <br>  I've been a programmer for seven and a half years.  I worked at a help desk (support) for two years before that.<br>  <br>  6. how do changes in technology affect your career?<br>  <br>  I have to stay on top of changes on my own, because my employers usually wont pay for me to get training.  If I don't keep my skills up to date, I'll have a hard time getting a job because employers are usually only looking for people with experience using the latest technologies.<br>  <br>  My first programming job was with an old, old (1960s) database system called Pick.  Last year, I was still interviewing for jobs and getting turned away because most of my work experience was with that outdated system and I didn't have much professional experience with modern systems.  But, I did have experience from things I worked on in my spare time, and was able to use those projects to get me new jobs working with new technologies.<br>  <br>  7. What is the average salary your job offers?<br>  <br>  It varies by area.  Here in Chicago it's around $70,000-$80,000/yr.<br>  <br>  8. What are its advantages?<br>  <br>  I get to work with a lot of cool technologies and interesting people.<br>  <br>  9. Disadvantages?<br>  <br>  It's hard to get started in a programming career...everybody's looking for someone with experience.  It also takes a lot of work to keep up-to-date with technology.<br>  <br>  10. What can you tell to the people who are interested in getting the same job as you do?<br>  <br>  Never stop being curious.  Never stop asking "how does this work"?  In college, take business courses along with your computer science courses to get a good idea of what goes on outside the IT department.  Join clubs and get used to dealing with other people who might not be as rational as a computer, but still have valid feelings you have to take into account.<br>  <br>  11. What are the qualities one must have to be able to cope up with the demands of your work?<br>  <br>  A good programmer needs patience for working with others and working through problems, and maturity to deal with difficult people in a professional manner.  It also takes strength to keep bosses from walking all over you with demands for overtime and last minute changes to a project.<br>  <br>  On the technical side of things, it helps to be curious and observant.  Sometimes one letter in a thousand lines of code makes the difference between a program that works and one that doesn't, and it might be your job to find it.<br>  <br>  12. What other things do you do to improve your performance in your career?<br>  <br>  I listen to podcasts like the ones from I.T. Conversations with leaders in the tech field discussing the latest trends and technologies.  I read books...not just "how to" books on different languages, but books on concepts & techniques that interest me like "The Long Tail" or "Ship It!".  I read blogs from other developers about experiences they're having and projects they're working on.  And, lastly, I turn the computer off and let my mind focus on other things so I'm not sick of staring at a screen when that big emergency call comes in the middle of the night!<br>  <br>  And on that note, I'm going to turn this computer off...and go to bed!  Happy New Year!

Do your best to befriend people who have enjoyed the success you seek.  Be willing to make the sacrifices necessary for the success.  That is the hard part for most people.  <br>  <br>  For example-- a lot of people would just love to be doctors--they make lots of money, have the cool title etc. but few are willing to make the sacrifices to get there such as 1) Always getting excellent grades 2) Working at menial tasks--my husband spent 2 years giving people baths so that when the time came for his application to med school he would have lots of recommendations from qualified people about his ability to deal with patients etc.3) Giving up free time to make ends meet--My husband was home only from Noon Saturday until Noon Sunday every week for two and a half years during school--and sometimes even that time was taken away.  We never owned a house or a new car long past the time when his college friends were acquiring all sorts of great things.

AA10074148	There is an old technique I use to use in purchasing REO from banks before they start using real estate agents for this purpose. Things were so simple then.<br>  <br>  Go to your nearest large bank, ask to speak to the Vice President as you have a problem that you think he and only he can solve.<br>  <br>  When you get a chance to speak to him, Tell him "I know that you might not be able to help me but I am looking for the person that handles your REO list of properties that he Realtors could not sell, who in your bank handle this department? If he is not at this branch can you give me the telephone number of the branch he is located?"<br>  <br>  I am not guaranteeing this will still work, but it worked in the olden days or yore. It might be worth a try.<br>  <br>  You might also try pre-foreclosures. They work also, that is what I do and very successful.<br>  <br>  You might also go to the foreclosure sale, not to bid, but to see if the property sell. If it does not sale, find out the lender. You already know the minimum bid. Fire off an offer for the minimum bid along with a check for 10% with a letter indicating how you are gonna come up with the rest.<br>  <br>  I have been successful with this method also. As long as it does not take a month or more to come up with the remainder of the funds.<br>  <br>  You might also send a copy of your credit report and ask if you can take over the existing loan as long as you bring it current.<br>  You might tell the lender that the funds will be over nighted to them. I have had 3 of these work, but then I have only applied for 3.    In the 3 that I applied for I offered to pay a 1% fee to take over the existing loan, so they would have an incentive to do it.<br>  <br>  I hope this has been of some use to you,good luck.<br>  <br>  "FIGHT ON"|`|b109a6bd530189e01b5888cd65729ce6aa	There really is no way to contact the lender. You need to contact the real estate agent that has the property listed. That is why the lenders send the listing to the real estate agents. I list foreclosure properties and they are extremely busy right now and I have trouble getting in touch with them sometimes.<br>  One way to find out if it is a foreclosure is to look at the listing sheet. It should say "subject to sellers addendums" somewhere on it. Good luck.

Most people are broke because they dont realise that they are broke. Job is good to have till better things come along. Never trust the job as secure. There is no such thing called security in the job as the employer can fire the employee any time with 5 minute notice. Starting a small business with no capital investment and setting a game plan to implement and work accordingly during the weekends and weekdays evenings without affecting the job schedule and working partime can create significant income. There is one such business in my knowledge called financial industry business. Helping people understand how money works will eventually lead you to make money. That is the reason, poor people are always poor and rich get richer. <br>  <br>  I recently joined a great home based business. Its a Financial industry business. We work hard for money, But rarely we understand how to make money work for us. we make money, and we save in the bank. The bank give us 1 to 2 % interest and they utilize our money to invest and they make more than 12%. They know how to make money work for them. Because of the growing demand, people wanted to know what the bank does to make profit. <br>  Financial industry business is a home based with no inventory business which enables you to earn some great money.

FVgWqroHaa	j aime la fa?on dont les pro sarko evite de repondre vraiment a la question en deviant, sur le public par exemple, ou sur le fait qu on pensait gagner plus en bossant moins. <br>  <br>  D'une part, on peut aussi vouloir gagner plus par une promotion a un poste plus elevé ou par un salaire revaloriser au niveau que vous meritez vraiment (est ce normal qu une personne avec bac+6 touche le smic? non, est ce normal que parce que dans le privé les entreprises ne reconnaissent pas la valeur des diplomes, il faille s acharner sur les salariés du publics, ou la oui les diplomes sont reconnus? moi je croi qu il est la le vrai debat.)<br>  <br>  D autre part, il y a aussi des gens qui ne veulent pas faire d heures supp car leur famille, leur loisir ou leur santé ou que sais je passent avant le fait de vouloir plus de tunes, et c marrant mais des qu une personne dit qu elle ne veut pas faire d heures supp, les pro sarko la traite de feignante et d assistée (alors que finalement pour refuser de faire des heures supp, ?a implique donc que la personne traville et donc qu elle n est pas assistée). Moi c est mon cas, je ne veux pas faire d heures supp, je suis en contrat etudiant dans un job que je deteste et que je fais juste parce qu il faut bien manger (donc deja si je deteste mon job, j evite d y mettre plus que necessaire les pieds) et parce que je suis encore etudiante, j ai donc des cours, et enfin parce que tant que je ne suis pas encore salarié a temps complet je veux en profiter pour exercer un maximum ma passion, l equitation et prendre soin du cheval qu on m a confié, ce qui demande bcp de temps. C est mon choix, je ne veux pas travailler plus pour gagner plus parce que je me contente de ce que j ai par rapport au depenses que je fais.  Et donc la je suis une feignante?<br>  <br>  <br>  Mais pour en revenir a la reponse que ts les sarkoziens veulent eviter de donner: il est clair que les heures supp accrues vont anihiler le besoin de creation d emploi, c est completement mecanique et logique, au dela de toute subjectivité politique.

Luckily, the security guard was nice enough to not have us arrested and answered all questions we had.  He said that the theft part would only be sent to stores under the company.

It mostly depends on the extent of your crime & if you were convicted.  Also, health records would never be on a background check.

iGHDbIIeaa	My feeling is that there is no more corruption in large corporations than in small businesses.  It is just that the media does not cover small business.  <br>  On a daily basis, the small business owner is looking for ways to keep more cash in his/her pocket by cheating everyone from the vendors to the customers to the IRS.<br>  The large corporation has to answer to the stockholders, who are not happy if they are not making money.  Officers of companies are looking for ways to build up their mighty buck as well.  It is a vicious cycle.

Even with good advertising, it takes awhile for a new club to drum up good business, which means for the first few months, it's not going to be the most lucrative place for a dancer.  The "bests" are going to be raking in the dough at the more established clubs.  You'll just have to take what you can get until you get enough business to make it somewhere where a top earner is going to want to be.  The other alternative would be to actually pay your dancers (most dancers aren't paid by the club, but work for tips).

They also get more money from advertisements than most because ads can be targetted to the user. So instead of seeing mostly mortgage and other financial ads on bank websites, simply searching on Google for a bank or loan would give u the same ads. Very nice system if you look at their AdSense program.

69ab44ea977b531164b1b115f341dc1daa	Antes que nada, Antonio Stradivarius fue miembro de una de las familias de fabricantes de instrumentos musicales más importantes, no sólo de Italia, sino del mundo entero. <br>  Como sólo se fabricaron una cantidad fija de estos instrumentos, se aprecian con el paso del tiempo (son bienes con oferta inelástica), y dada su gran calidad, sus precios de mercado alcanzan hasta los cuatro millones de dólares. Así que te aconsejo que corrobores la procedencia del instrumento, pues de ser auténtico, tendrías en tus manos una inversión muy segura.<br>  Saludos.|`|EJLKnPFMaa	Si te lo están vendiendo, no es Stradivarius .... es "Estrada y varios".|`|gIUQ5vqPaa	No es buena idea porque seguro que es falso.

Una vez me quisieron vender uno y era notoriamente falso, me lo dejaban en 7000 dólares, decían que era robado. Y si así fuera, te van a agarrar, porque para venderlo te va a costar muchísimo. No soy economista, pero tengo un poquito de calle en el tema. mi consejo, no lo compres por nada del mundo. Quedate tranquilo que si fuera verdadero, no te lo venderían ni a vos ni mi, a menos que vos seas brad pitt y te lo esté vendiendo la mujer más fea del pueblo y te quiera voltear.

fz2woMMTaa	you should speak to the council and notify them of your situation.    ask them to give you a balance of the council tax outstanding and then tell them that you will be stopping the direct debit that you are currently paying (obviously not until you are leaving) but will set up a standing order to finish paying the arrears.    that way you will not overpay and have to try to get it back, and you will not be leaving your friends to clean up the mess!|`|bvgQV9lMaa	Stop running scared and get a grip, you can't run away from your debts.

J&S means that everyone is jointly responsible for the whole debt, so if you scarper, the others will have to pay your share too.

Most likely even if he didnt say that your starting mon, thats probably the reason he asked you to come back. Even if you don't have the shirt or apron with their logo, wear the rest of the uniform. And if you're still not positive pack extra clothes to change into, or just call him up and ask him. He is going to be you're manager so you have to get comfortable talking to him. Good luck!

Malah sangat banyak sekali pelaku bisnis konvensional "mengurung" usahanya agar tidak tanpak dari luar, supaya tidak dikenakan pajak. Wah banyak sekali macam itu.

Si pagaras el 5% del capital al mes tardarías varios a?os en acabar de pagar. Yo te sugeriría, y quizá es un problema grave, que hagas la menor cantidad de pagos posibles. Si otro banco absorbiera tu deuda, que sí se puede, va intentar exclavizarte también. Si pagas 5000 mensuales, antes de que acabe el a?o estarás libre de deudas. Tal vez eso sea mucho, pero si no lo haces así, pronto deberás más de 100,000. La otra es: trata de juntar 20,000 y consigue que alguien te preste otros 20,000 y a cambio a esa persona le ofreces pagarle 24000 en un a?o: él habrá obtenido un rendimiento de 20% que no se lo paga nadie y tú habrás bajado tu tasa de interés del 48% al 20%.<br>  Para usar una tarjeta de crédito siempre debes ponerte reglas muy estrictas, es la mejor manera de no perder el control:<br>  1. Nunca pagues a meses sin intereses algo que dejará de servir antes de que termines el pago (no pagues el Super, por ejemplo, con mensualidades, pero sí se vale que te compres un refrigerador).<br>  2. Trata de pagar el saldo de tu tarjeta cada mes; enfoca tus compras a la semana posterior a tu fecha de corte, de tal suerte que tengas 40 días para pagar lo que compras.<br>  3. Genera un buen historial crediticio, eso te puede bajar puntos en algunas tarjetas. Si siempre pagas el saldo, podrías bajar hasta un 30% la tasa.<br>  4. Nunca gastes en la tarjeta más de un 25% de tu salario. De preferencia no deberías pasar del 15%, a no ser que tengas mucha liquidez y la uses para evitar el efectivo.

Since you have been renting to him for 2 years you can count the rent you are receiving as income towards your new house.   You just have to show the last 2 years tax statements with the added income.     You should be able to qualify for another house with this unearned income added to your earned income.    The banks will accept your adjusted income from your 1040 as your actual income.|`|EXJfoGtAaa	You bought a home "subject to a mortgage?"  That means the mortgage is still in the seller's name.  Good and bad.  If there is any equity in the home, just sell it and pay the investor in full.  You may have some leverage.  Most mortgages contain a clause that may be to your benefit.  A "due on sale" clause says the mortgagee (lender) can call the loan due if ownership changes.  Also mortgages contain an occupancy clause.  It may require him to occupy the property.   Discuss this with him and if nothing else deed the property back to him.  You really need legal advise.    realtor.sailor|`|2N6oTOLQaa	Let this be a lesson, cosigning a loan is legally the exact same thing as signing the loan.    Your name is on another mortgage. The only way to take your name off that mortgage is to get that mortgage paid off by either paying it yourself or getting it refinanced without your name on the new loan.     If you can't qualify for both payments, you can't get another mortgage until the old one is paid.     Sorry, but that's what cosigning does. You should have researched what it means to sign your name to a very large loan before you did it.|`|TpMvr1pyaa	many lenders allow a buyer to have as many as 7 mortgages in their  name if your credit and cash flow can stand it!

pCEA7Pu8aa	Even after your house is sold at the courthouse steps the bank still has to evict you.  Of course they would like it if you left volentaroly but if not they will have to get you evicted and then bring in the sheriff.  That is when you hear about foreclosed homeowners getting their stuff put on the street.    I would never leave until I was forced to but I would be prepared for that day.    The Ohio congresswomen told all CNN viewers to not leave and start squatting.  She was even quoted asking, where is the stimulus package for the people?    The reason for that is of course the bank is so overwhelmed they do not know what they have and what they do not have and have no way of keeping tabs on properties.    Take a chance and stay until they day they force you out.  What do you have to lose.  Just enjoy a few more months of rent free and mortgage free living.|`|EXJfoGtAaa	Foreclosure or eviction is the same.

If you own it...it shouldn't be rocket science...if you stopped paying your mortgage, then obviously you are going to have to leave.    If you own, they DO NOT HAVE TO GO TO COURT to evict you...ALL mortgage companies make you sign a document at closing bypassing the eviction process...ALL OF THEM.    COURTS DO NOT ISSUE A JUDGMENT OF EVICTION IN A FORECLOSURE!!!!|`|qBCGH52haa	The bank must start eviction proceedings to force you to move.  The bank would prefer that you left voluntarily which is why they sent the two folks out to tell you to move.  At some point, if you do not move, the proceedings will be held, an eviction notice posted and the sheriff will come to your house and remove all your personal belongings (and probably padlock the door).  Your belongings will be moved to the curb only and it will be your responsibility to move them from there.    You should receive notices for each step along the way (unless you voluntarily leave before the eviction date).|`|TpMvr1pyaa	UNDER no circumstances must you leave until someone has  a court judgment in their hands.  ALSO, YOU should be  given a court summons to go to protect your interest.  I would go if i were you.    you might even sell 1/2 or 1/4 of your home if it has not been  legally foreclosed YET.
0cd7030137d609db5865ec5a97d51d70aa	A couple of things to consider:    1) While speed is of the essence (most applications for a job are received within the first few hours and days of their posting), don't be in such a rush to apply that you make silly errors or typos in your letter or resume.    2) Nowadays, most applications are received via the Internet, either through e-mail or by way of an online application process. This enables the job poster to utilize resume screening programs (sometimes called spiders) that will scan your resume for specific keywords related to the job for which you are applying. Sending a hard copy of your resume will  require that this be done by hand, which may be inconvenient to do.    If you are genuinely excited about this position, then let it show in your cover letter. But, submit both your letter and your resume via the computer, not the mailman.    Good luck.|`|A5omHujOaa	Hi Traumer,    If possible, I would always send a physical copy of your materials to the company, and avoid email. Email is probably one of the worst forms of communication when job hunting. Yes, it is easy, but it's also too easy for your email to get buried, deleted, lost, etc.    You said that you had a name from Career Builder.  Write your cover letter to that person directly so that it's more personal.  Research the company a little (there's a wealth of information online), then customize your cover letter and resume to show them the benefits of hiring you (based on your research).    Print out your cover letter and resume and mail them directly to the contact person.  People are bombarded with email every day, and the people who list jobs online are hit even harder.    By printing out your materials and mailing them, you'll stand out more and have a better chance of getting noticed in the swarm of applications they receive.  And that's what it's really about - getting attention, then getting the job.    For more information on this "Black Hole of Email," and why you should mail, check out the link below for a video that I created explaining this.    Hope this helps. Good luck!|`|OEg582rwaa	everyone is now accepting online applicatons only now.

Sales are very slow though.|`|0u6qy9Uuaa	e-commerce sites cost money to maintain - you won;t find any place that doesn;t charge a transaction fee if you want to accept online payments    if you had a regular retail store, it would cost you a minimum of $80-100 a month just for the priviledge of accepting credit card payments - even if you had no credit card transactions for the month.    Server space and internet connection costs money for the hosting company. I  doubt any free hosting site will have e-commerce features. You want to be in business? well, that costs money    Any website besides ebay or amazon will only have 1/1000th of the web traffic, so you'll probably get less sales - which won;t make up for less costs

Good luck!|`|ZPmqYNuwaa	I do think you should cut out the needing money part.  Everyone works because they need the money, no one works because it's fun, there kind of looking for more with that answer.  Instead of saying its a way to learn more responsibility you might want to change it to saying that you are a very responsible person and you want to build on that and learn new skills.  They may be hesitant to hire you before you have learned to be responsible if you know what I mean.  Besides, babysitting shows great responsibility.  I think your 'weakness' is really good too, honest and not really something you can help.    Biggest strength - hard for me to say for you, probably responsible since you can back it up with the babysitting experience.  Are you a great team player?  Enjoy working with others?  Organised?  A good time manager?    Hire - Tell them that you think you would be a really great fit for the position.  Find something in the job description you would do really well and talk about that.     Skills - This depends what the job is.. Think about what you would be doing on the job and what skills would be required to do it, and then talk about the ones that you do well.|`|ajkMt6gRaa	Watch the Hills on MTV. There are interviews ... first Heidi interviewed for a job she was not qualified for against other candidates.  She got the job because she was agressive and did not worry about pissing off the other applicants who were actually co-workers.      The second scenerio is a cross country job.  You are in one city and the job is somewhere else.  The "change" that will result from getting the job is ENORMOUS ... but the applicant focused on the job at hand.  Your job in an interview is to get an offer.  Think about how to get that offer.  Show you are aggressive.  Show you are committed.  Employers don't care so much about experience unless they are comparing two equally committed people.  The one that shows the best in the interview will show the best in social settings, in work settings.      Don't be afraid to say  that you are money and that you are confident.

mwkfirjRaa	I think you're wise to pay off the credit card first, since it's likely the card issuer will raise your interest rates in the future.  It will also improve your credit score because it will lower your debt utilization ratio (amount of debt divided by your available credit).    Once you have paid off the credit card, keep that account open, and apply any available funds to paying off your car loan.  Once the car loan is paid off, apply the same monthly amount as you used to pay for the loan payment into a savings account.  That way, you can pay cash for your next car.|`|3a8d8200494dea80c8e22d328cd4879aaa	You mean refund, not return. I'd pay off the highest interest loan first.|`|g7gvzhkpaa	pay the car off ,then work on your credit card ,that way you'll have one less thing too worry about .|`|qiYUZ4i8aa	Pay down the credit card.    Let's take this example: The interest rate on the car is 5%.  The interest rate on the credit debt is 13%.  The interest rate on the car is more or less fixed.  The interest rate on the credit card is not, and could be changing in the coming months as credit card companies reel in their debtors.    Therefore, if you use your tax refund to pay down your credit debt, as opposed to your car note, you are effectively (conceputally, of course) paying yourself 8%.     Good luck.
q3zY2ymgaa	Whenever you decide on any type of investment it is important to consider your financial situation, time line, and financial goal.      You may not be ready to invest in mutual funds if you can't afford to be without your funds for more than 2 years.  If you're looking to save up for a house or a car in the next 2 years then liquid savings is your best bet.  You can assure yourself liquidity and principal protection.      If you think you're ready for mutual funds than I recommend learning the basics through either yahoo finance or morningstar.com.      Mutual funds range from very conservative government bonds funds, to highly aggressive small cap (small, up and coming company) and international/global funds.  Global funds have both security risk (underlying stock) and foreign currency risk.      For starters I recommend looking for a good no load fund and doing systematic purchasing, also known as dollar cost averaging.  That means buying on a periodic basis (weekly, monthly, etc.) so that when the market comes down you purchase more shares.  This lowers your overall risk.  You may also want to look at ETF's, these are funds that trade like stocks.      Do some research, make a choice, and above all else stay the course.  Prepare yourself to potentially take some short term losses.  Also consider investing in your company retirement plan, or your own IRA.  The tax benefits of these plans will help you save more money in the long run.  Lastly don't invest what you can't afford to be with out.  Have a decent emergency fund before you start investing in mutual funds.  You would hate to invest $500 and all of a sudden only have $350 when a financial emergency arises.        GOOD LUCK!|`|AA12291184	I suggest that you not invest in mutual funds.|`|AueAwhQeaa	A lot of how you want to invest in a fund depends on your age, how much risk you are willing to take, and your first investment.    First if I were you, I would look at those ideas, then you can narrow it down to what funds or funds are best for you and your goals. I would advise having more than 1 fund.     If you have sometime to let the money grow, now is a good time to get into the market with as low as it is.|`|A1q8vA9Daa	Not a great time to invest in mutual funds. Keep yourself updated on various matters related to investing, budgeting and saving etc.,|`|OYWTG9j6aa	Look for low expense ratios and "no load" funds.  Best in the market now are DFA, but hard to get access.  Next is Vanguard.  Look for Global to get diversification.

Best of luck and patience!!!!|`|DJYmAjkPaa	Well, depends on whether you believe in performance or fund manager. You can take a look at a site called Fund Mojo which has both performance tracking and fund manager tracking.|`|OGliYbi7aa	Pick a diversified domestic growth fund that performed in the top quartile of all mutual funds over the last three to five years. It will probably have averaged an annual rate of return of about 20%. The fund should also have a better-than-average record in the latest 12 months when compared to other domestic growth stock funds.  Steer away from funds that concentrate in only one industry or one area like energy, electronics, or gold. The investment company you pick does not have to be in the top three or four in performance each year to give you an excellent profit over 10 to 15 years.

VAI6MtPIaa	Criminal background check is usually what they do. They could also do a previous work experience check (but not many employers do that).    Don't listen to the guy below me.     They are going to need to make sure that you haven't been convicted of anything. If you have a prior conviction for drug usage or whatever else will be listed on a Criminal background check.|`|ZPmqYNuwaa	Most health care proffessions do a background and police check.  Especially if you are working with children or elderly.  Basically they want to make sure you are of good moral character so that you wont take advantage of vunerable people.  If you have criminal charges you might be in trouble.  History of theft or scamming would certainly disqualify since you may steal from clients and any kind of physical, mental, or sexual abuse is also a red flag.    If you have never been charged with anything you should be just fine.    I agree with the first poster that it is most likely a criminal background check, but it is possible that your employer may do a work history and other kinds of checks.  I work as a chemical engineer and know people who have been denied jobs for a single possession charge.  My work also checked with every place I have worked or gone to school in the past 10 years, as well as reference checks from people I had known for at least 5 and were not family members.  Some are more detailed then others.  If you haven't done anything that would make you unsuitable for working with vunerable people you will be fine.|`|VR0h4L32aa	what are you trying to hide???|`|WrUTuQdlaa	Everything.

You need to pay this debt off yourself. If you go to a debt consolidation agency they basically take your debt tack on more debt and than you end up owning even more money.    for example if you own 20,000 and go for consolidation you will than owe 25,000 and this 25,000 will continue to occur fee's and annual increases of most likely 25% a year. so in four years you 25,000 debt will be 50,000. just pay it off yourself and cut back on everything else as much as you can|`|0u6qy9Uuaa	what is your income situation? you won;t be able to get a consol loan - the 3 bills in collection are the only real issue right now - offer them a payment plan of less than a year|`|OjBREbmOaa	Myth: Debt consolidation saves interest and you have one smaller payment.

It will take time to rebuild, but just make it a point to pay everyone on time every time and don't use credit cards unless absolutely necessary and try to pay them off in full each month.  Good luck.|`|SLSX6QQsaa	I was in your same boat for quite some time.  As far debt consolidation, I will caution you that the companies which get lower interest rates and payments for you also do put a big ding in your credit.  I used a credit counseling program which lowered my credit score by about 100, and it took me 2 years to rebuild my credit.  As far as the bills in collections, I also had those.  I called the bill collecter and they offered settlement amounts. Even if they give you one amount, don't accept that right away. Tell them you can only afford lets say, $100, or whatever. They sometimes will go lower.  And don't bother calling them until you have at least 30% of the total bill available for payment.  Thats about the minimum they normally take to settle the account.  Although they urge you to pay the whole amount, settling changes the account to positive standing on your credit so thats what you need.  My plan/advice would be to keep paying your minor bills as you are, then get 1 credit card (try capital one, you may pay a fee of $79 to open the account and have a low credit limit but will build your credit) only use the credit card for a few purchases then pay off EVERY MONTH, keep paying bills ON TIME, and pay off your smallest bill in collections first, then another, and finally another.  Remember to try and settle the accounts, and don't bother calling unless you have 30% up front minimum.  You can pay using credit, but don't.  Use cash/debit only or you end up putting yourself in even more debt.|`|8Q9nQFWaaa	I used "Credit Solution" to settle my debt and avoid bankruptcy.They managed to reduce my debt up to 58%.It's legitimate.I came across this company on NBC News Special Edition.Check it out here:  http://CreditSolution.ez-mart.biz|`|9HoXpsP6aa	Feeling so overwhelmed sucks.

I also sometimes will ask family members, not to be noisy, but to figure out if I should be offering them any help before they end up in serious trouble and I either can't help them, or they need so much it is a strain.   This might be what your father in law is thinking, wanting to know if you need help while he has the ability to help you.

Tell the old gent to 'buzz off'.|`|UDxL7lPqaa	What you paid will be a matter of public record when the deed is recorded.|`|lLm5uIuDaa	Though it's really never proper to bring up money questions whether family or not, your home is a matter of public record and he could easily get that info.  So I always say, who cares?  I have never had an issue telling people what we paid if they asked.  It's just not a big deal to me.  It's just a purchase.  I think we all make too much of this kind of stuff.  It's not important enough to make family feel bad they asked.  What could they possibly do with the information?|`|qBCGH52haa	That is true.  Also,, the amount paid is usually recorded at the county clerk's office with the deed and is public domain and accessible by anybody.|`|gemaW0KQaa	Yes and they can also get a ruff idea by homes in the area.|`|PVMsr2Faaa	True on both accounts. He is rude but it can be looked up by just about anyone.|`|944e2748d03e1efff042dce931e63f28aa	Yes, that's true.  Anyone can see what a home sold for as well as current values of other homes.  www.zillow.com    And it wasn't a rude question.  He's your husband's father and he was curious about what his son's family was doing.  Would you tell your own father what you paid?  Probably yes, right?|`|TpMvr1pyaa	probably.  but stick to your grounds.  It is a private issue.  I volunteer  that data, others don't. Its like weight.  Or sex preference.|`|uW4npxzFaa	Yes that's true. When their in the business they can find stuff like that out of they wanted to. It's not ethical though. I have a friend in Real Estate and she does it sometimes. And Yes! It is very rude to ask someone such a personal money question. I think people should only volunteer anwsers to money questions.|`|57e2f61534cb280dd3b9f69e82a68f67aa	Not only is the sale price public info, so is the loan attached to the house, so I can see how much your mortgage is for as well|`|ikXRqWxUaa	that is true.  house sale is a matter of public record, and he could easily find out if he was so inclined.  the better question would be "why is he so inclined"?  sounds to me like your father is a bit on the rude side, although i would have to know him to know if he meant anything by it or not.|`|1lEuIu23aa	Yes that is true.  It is public records on what you paid and how much you pay in taxes a year; however, it was rude for him to ask you!|`|ZWdpuCoqaa	you can find the tax ur previous owner paid and the price you paid . its all available online.    and with county office also.    check out    zillow.com and put in your address and you will get all the details of the last sale on the house.|`|ae8823673c3e8e421f769986450c0cd2aa	Keep your father in law's game. Ask him in the future how much does the hose costs (to see if he checked) and then tell him he has been rude directly and punish him.  We can always punish anyone.  We must teach everyone to respect private life.|`|WPd4MYt6aa	Yes it can be looked up, but I don't see how that's a rude question. He's your father in law. He's family. It's not like he's just some random stranger or something.|`|eUDPfWdpaa	you are correct it is rude, you are an adult and capable of managing you own life.  My family is the same way so I really feel for you.  Don't give in you have to have some privacy.|`|pCEA7Pu8aa	It is public record and he can even look it up on his own at the county's website.    I think it is a bit rude too though there is really nothing you can do to hide it unless you are a law enforcement officer.    The county will hide their records so people can not get mad and look them up.
