clGPFqRsaa	I'd go with the Toyota. Toyotas are extremely reliable cars no matter what their year is. Their engines will outlast you as long as you keep up do date with their maintenance. Plus, you'll have a lot of money left over just paying $800 for the car. Remember, you're going to have to pay servicing fees, and gas. Toyotas are also great on gas, keep in mind that the cobalt takes premium gas and the Toyota takes regular. You're only sixteen, you may want to get something reliable and cheap for now, then possibly trade in your car for a newer and more expensive one once you can afford it.|`|jKDZlgMiaa	A manual, beat up old pickup truck that doesn't go fast. <-- sorry, that's the mom in me wanting you to be safe  :)<br>  <br>  Check out how much your ins is going to be and if it will be higher/lower depending on the vehicle.|`|Nl2U569eaa	hmmmmm....here's an idea. Take your list to a local mechanic and ask them. They'd probably have some good advice. Also, you could consider paying a mechanic to look at all three. They could tell you which is in the best condition.|`|67K4awwDaa	So I don't have a specific car suggestion... but you should look for something that gets good gas mileage so buying gas doesn't break the bank, look for something safe since you are a new driver, look for something old so that it's cheaper, and look for something owned by an older person because they tend to have taken care of their cars so you can get more out of it.  Corolla seems like the best choice for you because you like it and it's cheap to fix.  Toyota made cars are very well known for their reliability and for how long they last.  You will probably be happy with that choice as long as there aren't major problems and the car was taken care of.  For $800, it's not going to be the most amazing car you will ever own... but it will probably still be a good start.  If it turns out to be a car you hate, at least you won't be out much and you can probably still sell it for $500 minimum later on.  My first car was a tiny old hatchback with lots of quirks and I loved it!|`|333a8b96e50ca7be29e4122a1437a3d4aa	99 cavalier would be my choice, they were a fairly reliable car and your insurance shouldn't be too high, Cobalt being a newer vehicle you'll probably be paying quite a bit for insurance.|`|OgvkF5mvaa	with 5gz u can get a nice civic <br>  in ur situation a 4dr<br>  Ull get good MPG/INsurence cheap/maintanace is cheap<br>  and they last way longer than a cav<br>  with 5,500 U can get 1 on craiglist for cheap depending where u live

qjg0g5WMaa	bad motor mount usually in the front lower|`|AA11561859	first of all usually if the trans has been rebuilt there is possibillities for human error if it was a remanufacted there is a chance but at least it was tested at some point prior to install one thing to think about is are you parking on an incline when the concern happens? if so what could be happening is when you put you car into park and the roll/lunge that happens after you let off the brake,  what happens is,  whats called a parking pawl (lever) that basically prevents the trans from moving when shifted into park, on an incine you increase the pressure on that device so when you shift out of park you release the tension on the lever and it causes the loud bang /pop noise, one thing that helps is the use of you parking brake, if it works properly and is adjusted properly will reduce the force on the parking pawl and decrease the noise heard if not resolve the issue all together . just some food for thought
f5fe3b1be0a46888cde7c443097823c0aa	As already stated, check the laws, but I'm pretty sure 15% is illegal for ANY state for the front side windows.  Also check the law on rear side windows and rear window - Some states specify a percentage for the rear side windows, and some even specify a percentage for the rear window.  <br>  <br>  As far as same percentage all-around, I wouldn't advise it.  If you tint the rear window the same percentage as the side windows, it may end up looking lighter because: when you look through a side window, you are looking through one tinted window and the other tinted window across from it...but when you look through your rear window, you are only looking through one tinted window.  I ended up getting mine 35% on the front/rear sides and 15% in the rear and it looks good.  Also be careful how dark you tint your rear window because it can become a hazard if it's too difficult to see through.|`|1e85b081f9cb68b21b9d1357e658f9ccaa	Some states don't allow darker than 15% on the drivers and passengers side front windows and you can go much darker on the rear doors and back glass.

5v1RV0Gxaa	Hard to know the long term reliability of the 2009 Ford Focus, i know reviews by MSN Autos give it a 7.0 and with only a handful of consumer reviews, i really don't think you can get a good feel. Consumer reports rates the 2009 Ford Focus at 71, which i don't think is too good.<br>  <br>  The Jetta does report some minor engine issues in the 2006 model, but MSN Auto review is an 8.2 and user reviews are a 9.2 (that is based off of 167 reviews, which is much more valid than 12 for the Ford) The 2005 Jetta does not have the same engine issues reported as the 2006 model if that makes any difference to you.<br>  <br>  What i have always loved about the VW's i have owned over the years (VW GTI, VW Golf and VW Beetle) is the feel of the car and the driving experience. When i test drove comparable Japanese or American cars, i noticed things like the sound of the door closing (much more solid on the VW), interior amenities (VW is just so well set up for my taste) and the feel of the ride, shifting and steering (all more sporty on the VW's.)<br>  <br>  Cars and owners have a special bond and there is a very personal component to what makes some people like one car over another. Test drive them both.

8QMvsIfKaa	First off you said it your self. it's built for off road. If you want to make it have better highway speeds you're not going to have much choice but to swap the differential gears to a higher gear. It sounds like you might have about 4:09 or 4:27 gears if it's stock. You would be better off for highway to use about a 3:31, but it's going to kill it on the trail for pulling. Just use four low off road and it would be good to go. Scouts are built like tanks, is it a 345? They came factory with 2:72, 3:07,3:31,3:54,3:73,or 4:09 gears. Some Scout 80s had 4:27, or 4:88s. Look in the glove box to see if you still have a build sheet and you can figure out from that which gears you had from the factory, but that could have easily been changed. Or just pull the dif cover and count the ring gear teeth (the big ring gear) then divide that by the pinion gear (the little gear the drive line connects to) teeth. Keep in mind you have to change both front and rear gears out, and put the old gears in a bag and oil them so if you ever want them you have them.|`|Py7rQ5kQaa	I think it will be quite hard.

69b28c895ecbe3f5e0fc99326c84d73faa	The History of Railroad Innovations <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>   <br>  Outline of Railroad History <br>  <br>  By Mary Bellis <br>  <br>  Roads of rails called Wagonways were being used in Germany as early as 1550. These primitive railed roads consisted of wooden rails over which horse-drawn wagons or carts moved with greater ease than over dirt roads. Wagonways were the beginnings of modern railroads. <br>  <br>  By 1776, iron had replaced the wood in the rails and wheels on the carts. Wagonways evolved into Tramways and spread though out Europe. Horses still provided all the pulling power. In 1789, Englishman, William Jessup designed the first wagons with flanged wheels. The flange was a groove that allowed the wheels to better grip the rail, this was an important design that carried over to later locomotives. <br>  <br>  The invention of the steam engine was critical to the invention of the modern railroad and trains. In 1803, a man named Samuel Homfray decided to fund the development of a steam-powered vehicle to replace the horse-drawn carts on the tramways. Richard Trevithick (1771-1833) built that vehicle, the first steam engine tramway locomotive. On February 22, 1804, the locomotive hauled a load of 10 tons of iron, 70 men and five extra wagons the 9 miles between the ironworks at Pen-y-Darron in the town of Merthyr Tydfil, Wales to the bottom of the valley called Abercynnon. It took about two hours. <br>  <br>  In 1821, Englishman, Julius Griffiths was the first person to patent a passenger road locomotive. <br>  <br>  In September, 1825, the Stockton & Darlington Railroad Company began as the first railroad to carry both goods and passengers on regular schedules using locomotives designed by English inventor, George Stephenson. Stephenson's locomotive pulled six loaded coal cars and 21 passenger cars with 450 passengers over 9 miles in about one hour. <br>  <br>  George Stephenson is considered to be the inventor of the first steam locomotive engine for railways. Richard Trevithick's invention is considered the first tramway locomotive, however, it was a road locomotive, designed for a road and not for a railroad. Stephenson was extremely poor growing up and received little formal education. He worked in local collieries and was self-taught in reading and writing. In 1812, he became a colliery engine builder, and in 1814 he built his first locomotive for the Stockton and Darlington Railway Line. Stephenson was hired as the company engineer and soon convinced the owners to use steam motive power and built the line's first locomotive, the Locomotion. In 1825, Stephenson moved to the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, where together with his son Robert built (1826-29) the Rocket. <br>  <br>  Colonel John Stevens is considered to be the father of American railroads. In 1826 Stevens demonstrated the feasibility of steam locomotion on a circular experimental track constructed on his estate in Hoboken, New Jersey, three years before George Stephenson perfected a practical steam locomotive in England. The first railroad charter in North America was granted to John Stevens in 1815. Grants to others followed, and work soon began on the first operational railroads. <br>  <br>  Designed and built by Peter Cooper in 1830, the Tom Thumb was the first American-built steam locomotive to be operated on a common-carrier railroad. <br>  <br>  The Pullman Sleeping Car was invented by George Pullman in 1857. Pullman's railroad coach or sleeper was designed for overnight passenger travel. Sleeping cars were being used on American railroads since the 1830s, however, early sleepers were not that comfortable and the Pullman Sleeper was very comfortable. <br>  <br>  Advanced Train Systems<br>  In the 1960s and early 1970s, considerable interest developed in the possibility of building tracked passenger vehicles that could travel much faster than conventional trains. From the 1970s, interest in an alternative high-speed technology centered on magnetic levitation, or maglev. This vehicle rides on an air cushion created by electromagnetic reaction between an on-board device and another embedded in its guideway. <br>  <br>  History of Different Railroad Inventors<br>  George Stephenson<br>  George Stephenson is considered to be the inventor of the first steam locomotive engine for railways.<br>  Richard Trevithick<br>  The first locomotive in the world was built by Richard Trevithick in 1804.<br>  Railroad Inventions Created by Women Inventors<br>  Early inventions include Mary I. Riggin's railway crossing gate; Eliza Murfey's lubricating systems for railroad car axles to reduce derailments; and Mary Walton's noise reduction system for elevated railroads in New York City.<br>  John Stevens<br>  Colonel John Stevens is considered to be the father of American railroads.<br>  Peter Cooper - Tom Thumb<br>  Steam Engines<br>  One main source of power for locomotives was steam. <br>  Railroad History<br>  Complete and concise history presented by the National Railroad Museum, of Green Bay, Wisconsin.<br>  Locomotive Types<br>  The Engli|`|b46935e51173f254db10092f55afe9b6aa	the chinese|`|W7FNm3iVaa	Richard Trevithick was the first to invent the steam locomotive. <br>  <br>  It wasn't until 15 years later that Englishman name Robert Stephenson invented another locomotive called the "Rocket" which make a speed record in the Rainhill trials. <br>  <br>  So techically the British were the ones who built the first railways. The US was just inspired by it.
GAMkUH9Taa	The labor rate on the module in question is only .4 hrs. If they are trying to say it is going to take much longer than that, then they are trying to rip you off. One more thing to keep in mind in the future. Just because something seems to be a minor thing to replace does not always mean that it is. Some car makers bury things in the stupidest locations and it is not the shops fault that they have to charge you so much. However this time that is not the case. Hope this helps.

The best bet would to go down to your local airport, and if you can find a good school, do that, but if not find a independent instructor (not w/ a flight school). It is a VERY expensive career, but worth it. But please think about and research what you will be getting yourself into.

Epshsktyaa	Media scaremongering is the main culprit. A little knowledge can be a dangerous thing and there are a lot of people who read parts of scientific literature but do not understand the whole story and then like to protest. The media pick up on this because "Frankenstein foods!" makes a more dramatic headline than "scientists help the world by increasing crop yields".<br>  <br>  There have been some shady things done in the past by large companies selling and trialing GM crops in third world countries but anything in europe will be properly regulated and researched so this should not be a problem. <br>  <br>  Unfortunate people in the UK are very set in there ways and don't like anything new that the general populous does not understand. Take the change to metric as an example. The rest of the world uses it, it's much easier to understand but because people are used to pounds and ounces and feet and inches they see the change to metric as being some kind of "foreign influence" and they don't like it. I'm not UK bashing here, I'm english myself.<br>  <br>  Finally to all those who say that we would loose the goodness that we get from "natural" plants. Does anyone out there really think that a tomato in the wild would grow all red and juicy like the ones we buy in the supermarket? It has taken years of cultivation and crossbreeding to get the vegetables that we now think of as "natural".

Thus making the farmers dependent on the seed company, like a crack addict is dependent on his crack dealer. Also there may well be eco-system implications of gm food that will evolve over time which are not understood yet. further the UK is NOT the only European country to not use gm food.
L0H4iVHWaa	you can only run that pair of subs @ 2 ohms, that amp puts out 800 watts at 2 ohms<br>  <br>  combined those subs have an rms rating of 500 watts, you will be overpowering them by 300 watts, overpowering isnt good because it causes your subs to clip and clipping causes voice coils to burn and blow which renderes them useless<br>  <br>  you need an amp that puts out between 400-500 rms watts @ 2 ohms<br>  <br>  _______________________________<br>  <br>  edit:<br>  <br>  yea you probably can, with lower gain but the bad thing about that is it wont be really that loud, your gain is going to need to be set NO MORE than 21.21volts, get a volt meter, set ALL sound settings to 0 such as bass, treble, mid settings on your deck and unhook your subs, get a digital volt meter and plug the connectors into the amp terminals and play a 60HZ note set it to repeat and adjust the gain until the volt meter shows 21.21 volts<br>  <br>  heres some more info *copied from sparky*:<br>  <br>  Here is a guide that will help you set the gain correctly <a href="http://www.box.net/shared/uchv4dbk88" rel="nofollow">http://www.box.net/shared/uchv4dbk88</a><br>  <br>  You'll need a multi-meter (AC voltmeter, $15 from Radio$hack), Microsoft Excel and a way to burn an audio CD from an MP3.<br>  <br>  If you don't have Excel, use this link <a href="http://www.box.net/shared/nkkw1dhk4g" rel="nofollow">http://www.box.net/shared/nkkw1dhk4g</a><br>  <br>  Set the LPF to just below the highest range of the frequency response of the subs.

AA10353490	With a 4X4 all wheels are trying to turn the same speed.  If a tire has a larger diameter then it will want to cover more ground than the smaller tires.  This puts a heavy strain on the drive line.  In addition, your stability will be reduced on slippery pavement since one or more of the tires will want to spin because they are being either pushed or pulled down the road.<br>  <br>  Simple rule, keep all four tires the same on a 4X4.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|tLaAdt4oaa	uh, yeah<br>  <br>  the wheels would turn with a different speed, which would make the slower wheels have no effect except for slowing down that side.<br>  <br>  in other words, you're screwed.<br>  <br>  however, if you had a two wheel drive for the example that was given, then it should be fine.|`|sw2R5A9iaa	this is true on any vehicle.|`|333a8b96e50ca7be29e4122a1437a3d4aa	Yes it will, your gear ratio's in the front and rear end are the same, if you try to put larger tires on the back it will try to push the front end along the road if your front diff is engaged and will bind the gears and do a lot of damage to the diffs.
b9906294d88c8e875c10481120cf0286aa	Since your mon is in control of you that means you are a minor. A minor cannot rent a dirt bike even if they are for rent. That is a legal contract and you have to be 18 to sign a binding legal contract. Beside mothers do not give up control easy. To them a motorcycle, dirt bike, scooter, motorbike is dangerous. I was seventeen in 1969 when my dad signed for me to get my first motor bike and my mother raised all sorts of cain. Heck if she had her way I would be under her control now at 57. Just wait till you are 18 then you can buy whatever you want.

Because most shops have other car's that need to be painted and won't paint your car as a priority. You could try to see if it can be buffed and detailed out if it isn't too bad or you could always take it to maaco. =)|`|VEfh03cAaa	first make sure the bumper is smooth, if it isn't, its usually easiest to replace it, but if it is smooth, paint the entire thing. it is impossible to get the exact same color as the rest of the bumper. when you paint the entire thing, it is very difficult to notice any variation in color. ;)
WrXY4Wm9aa	If Air Canada had some ab initio program, you could end up in the right seat at 21 or younger and 250 hours flight time. If they're like other airlines who rely on the supply of pilots already out there, you could be young and inexpeienced, or in your mid thirties with 7000 hours logged and two pervious airlines under your belt.

KSznsAGIaa	first of all, if you bore a 350 (.30) over you just ran out of room. i hope you meant .030. also, a stroker kit can be used with any size bore, your piston diameter determines the bore diameter.  have you got bore and stroke confused? an unstroked 350 .030" over is 355c.i. if you have a stroker kit it will be considerably more. stock bore is 4.00" and stroke is 3.48". if you increase bore by .030", you have a 355, but if you stroke it .250" 1/4", its about 381c.i. heres the formula...BORE X BORE X STROKE X THE NUMBER OF CYLINDERS X .785 = CUBIC INCHES  and its accurate. good luck. and not too much camshaft, please. too much cam takes all the fun out of a street motor|`|v8TWvtQgaa	Your alittle mixed up <br>  <br>  Stroker mean to change, lenghten the cranks stroke.  Like 383 stroker which is a .030" over 350 (355) with a longer stroke crank installed (3.75" vs std 3.48) <br>  <br>  So a 355 is not a stroker engine. <br>  <br>  A 355 is a chevy 350 bored .030" (not .30") over. <br>  <br>  No if you don't bore the block from std. 4.000 to 4.030, you can not use a 355 kit in it. <br>  <br>  Because you will have pistons and rings in the 355 kit thats .030" too big for the holes. They will not fit in a std bore<br>  <br>  You cold use the bearings, gaskets, etc from kit but you can't use the pistons and rings|`|4KF2cZWkaa	no because being bored .30 over makes a 350 into a 355c.i.|`|1af1c7a379dffa78d14850f6eb8af852aa	If you shoe horn the pistons really good!!!!

By the way, it could be something very small to get the check engine light to come on. It happened on mine because the gas cap wasn't closed tight enough.  The only thing is you won't pass smog if you have codes stored in your computer, even if the car drives fine.

JkTGq2BJaa	the duel cam engine is smoother running and produces more power because they will usually have more valves, 4 per cylinder instead of 2 per.because they produce more horse power they will run at lower rpm's to maintain the same speed.

The part was $50 (go to a pep boys ) not the ford dealership which will charge you $150. and if you know anything about cars, its pretty simple to install. The only real sure way to know he problem is to run the emmissions to find our what the code for check engine is then simply look that up. If its the transmission, then expect to pay much more for this problem. good luck-

mKVFIklaaa	Most likely a faulty thermostat, but could be a failing water pump.  Try running it from cold. The radiator should stay cold until normal temperature is reached. If it starts heating up straight away, the 'stat is stuck open or missing.|`|f5ibT3WNaa	IF it's pretty cold outside that is what a thermostat will do. The thermostat will keep the hot water in the engine while the radiator is cooling the other water. Once the water is warm enough in the engine the thermostat opens and you see the gauge go up. But you arent in a real cold area the thermostat could be saying open to long and thats why its reading low. Thats a very simple fix.|`|2yrEjfmLaa	it sounds like the radiator thermostat is bad. They can be replaced fairly easy. My car does this and is getting replaced soon.

A 1.8 Honda Civic is one & a half seconds quicker to 60, a bit faster top end, produces 15bhp more, averages 4mpg better & is beautifully built.    The 1.8S Civic would have been 800 cheaper than the Focus to buy, and at 18 months old would be worth 2,000 more than the Focus.|`|N7LlOAcOaa	For a crappy Ford focus I would pay nothing more than 4,000. This car is very un-reliable and is K-mart cheap plastic on the interior.    I wouldnt buy a ford If I were you....|`|Bu6lx93Jaa	i have a 1.8 zetec focus but its a 2004 model. the engine is ok and has good acceleration and the car has good handling.  unfortunately it like to drink and if you check out the technical specs you'll get about 30-39 mpg http://www.bristoltradecentre.co.uk/used...    i would recommend buying a car a little older and try and get all the mod cons
nP92OdBzaa	If your tires are out of balance then the vibration is usually only at certain speeds (like between 55 and 65). Usually you won't feel it at lower speeds.   It could be that your rims are bent a little and as your ball joints and tie rods get worse you feel the shaking more and more.  If your tie rods are going bad, that means the wheels have a lot of play side to side (the wheels move as if you turn the steering wheel a little side to side, but the steering wheel stays straight) and the car will drive like crap.|`|WwXrTQgaaa	Wow, it could be worn steering parts (tie ROD or ball joints) or simply out of balance tires. Get the tires balanced first - should be about $50.     An alignment will not cause the car to wobble like you describe, but will cause uneven tire wear.    The estimate sounds high, of course. Get a couple more estimates from other mechanics. I'd expect a few hundred bucks.    This can be dangerous. If the tie rods or ball joints are loose you risk them coming apart, at which time you would without a doubt wreck. That is very rare, but just FYI.|`|AioBp16Eaa	Hi,  I think one of your tires are starting to separate which makes the tie rod ends work harder than they should and will break and you are in the ditch or worse. Don't kill someone because of money. Take care.|`|f5ibT3WNaa	First of all it's not safe. Second of all go to another mechanic cuz it shouldn't cost that much to change the ball joints and tie-rods on that car. That is very danderous to drive like that.|`|JLayHNZCaa	You should at least get the tie rods and/or ball joint repaired.  This is a safety issue that at best could leave you stranded somewhere.   Perhaps you have a buddy who could assist you in doing the repairs and then have the vehicle aligned?  The parts aren't that bad, it is the labor that is pricey.
9eouWphjaa	Manual way better anyways. Why even worry about the automatic if your buying a performance car get a manual. Common Sense|`|Z9360MMxaa	Because if you are going to be driving a vehicle with that much horsepower putting in an automatic transmission is a waste and they probably designed the engine around a manual transmission like most cars with high horsepower.|`|N7LlOAcOaa	chevys suck.....and perform poorly on race day....|`|3axSwKh5aa	I'd call your local Chevy dealer and ask. It could be that you can get the turbo- but not in SS trim. You often don't get all the details on a website.|`|jI2frGsraa	We need more details as to what kind of Chevy coupe you are building.

t2XRy9G5aa	there are two differences between the XCF and XCF-W...    the XCF has a tight ratio transmission and much stiffer suspension set up more for MX track riding with the bigger jumps...    the XCF-W has a wide ratio transmission and a plusher suspension set up more for woods and enduro type riding...    the XCF basically equals the older model MXC, where the XCF-W equals the older model EXC ... the new EXC is the dual sport version now-a-days...    for woods and trails, the XCF-W is the much better suited ... and can have the suspension set up stiffer if you want to hit the tracks also but will still have the wide ratio transmission making it less quick corner to corner on a track...    depending on your size and riding ability, the 450F-W or the 300-W would be a better choice for a more experienced and/or heavier rider...    owned several KTMs, currently have 520/540 MXC and 525EXC which are better suited for me at 6'3" ~260 lbs...|`|EDOI3Wnzaa	the XCF-W has a wider gear ratio. This bike is set up for trails, woods riding. It requires less shifting than the XC-F.  The XC-F is set up for MX    Go with the XCF-W.  You will be happier if you bump up to the 400. The 250 lacks in torque.|`|d72a8e15b90497f4f828744386c193a2aa	PMK pretty much nailed it. I would just like to point out that the XC-F is not the motocross version, it is a woods bike. The 250 SX-F is the motocross version. The main differences are indeed the transmission and suspension. Where I live/race hare scrambles are big. We race in tight woods but many of our races are held at motocross parks and we do run part of the motocross track each lap. The XC-F and XC-F W both work well for this type of race, it is just a matter of preference from a suspension standpoint whether you prefer out of the box suspension that is stiffer or softer. Pretty much every serious woods racer has their suspension professionally done anyway so it doesn't matter to them. Same thing from the transmission side, I prefer a close ratio tranny even for woods racing, but that's just me. Honestly in the east where I race KTM dominates the circuit and I see about a 50/50 split between the XC-F and XC-F W models.|`|eb37564f6892a661980449122dc867f3aa	the "-w" added to the end.    Sorry I could not resist.

1bYITsABaa	The vehicle is subject to being towed for wrongful display of a tag.   Also, you say the decal is outdated- that means the vehicle is declared inoperable and that is against your city's ordinances. If you want to keep the vehicle, I suggest you obtain a correct, updated tag for it.|`|AA11828439	Yes it is.|`|mTwn8p79aa	Using someone else's plates can be a lot more expensive than just renewing your plates and is even a felony in some states as they think they're catching someone who was about to rob a bank, could be, right?|`|4cp2eZwbaa	In the state of Michigan, yes it is against the law to have it in an apartment complex.  It needs to be in the correct storage department.|`|UTP1UBIRaa	Yes, it is against the law to use someone else's plates.  You can also get a ticket for having an outdated license plate.

c7YlgvD5aa	aj<br>    Contrary to popular opinion GM is not going to leave the public or its customers hanging to dry. GM dropped Oldsmobile a few years ago and I can still call a multi-point GM dealership and still get Oldsmobile parts when need be. If you like your Saturn keep it they're great little cars. Used parts will always be an option also but those parts will go up a little because of price and demand.   Good Luck   bs|`|AA12023445	actually i doubt saturn will be cut. if they do they will lose about 50 percent of the market as saturn is one of there most marketable vehicles they have because they are cheap to produce are very reliable and have decent gas mileage ratings. if gm does sell saturn someone else will buy it and gm will be done. also you will find that if you do sell yours you will sell it fast. i had a 94 sc1 about 5 years ago and it sold within an hour and it had almost 200,000 miles on it and ran like new and didn't smoke or leak a drop and all i did to it was normal maintence like oil changes and put a alternator on it and thats it. i used synthetic oil of course . its still on the road today.|`|2E8w3BPIaa	If you like the car keep it.

26In6w8xaa	See if you can find a ZRX1100 Or ZRX1200 one bad bike hard to find though|`|aKirAFKdaa	Problem is that dual sports are a bit more expensive and hold their value better than standard bikes.  All you can do is keep your eye out for a deal and consider an older bike that has been garaged and still has some miles on it.<br>  <br>  Like the other guy said, stick with Japanese bikes.  Personally I wouldn't buy anything older than 1980 unless I were out to buy an antique.  Newer dual sports are much better especially when it comes to suspension.|`|YbMFfOkRaa	You might be able to find a used DR200SE or a DR125SE (older model) for that price. As the other poster mentioned, remember to factor in the price of your protective equipment (around $100 for a helmet) and insurance (about $100-$150 for liability only) into your budget. Depending on where you live, training courses can vary in price from almost free to quite expensive, but they're a great first step as you can figure out if you're comfortable on a motorcycle without buying it first. Many sellers won't let you test drive a bike, even with a motorcycle endorsement on your license, so it's important to figure this out ahead of time.<br>  The suzuki dual-purpose bikes you've mentioned are good bikes- they have a shorter seat height than most other dual purpose bikes. You might also be able to find a older suzuki sherpa, which was a 250.|`|AA12076385	That's a pretty low budget for getting a vehicle of any kind, not that it can't be done, I just don't think it can be done safely.<br>  <br>  First thing, call a couple of insurance companies for quotes. If you are still interested after hearing the price of insurance, Visit the local bike shop and price some gear, helmet; gloves; jacket; and glasses at a minimum. You will also want bags for your books. If still interested, call to find the price of the MSF beginning rider course.<br>  <br>  By now you may have already got the price tag up to $1500, and you don't even have the bike yet.<br>  <br>  To tell the truth, I bought my first bike for $500, I didn't do any of the above due to finances and ignorance.

c48nm70gaa	The rubber gasket by all means should have been oiled. The next time you try to remove the oil filter the gasket most likely will stick and cause problems removing it. New oil filters should be tightened 3/4 of a turn *after the gasket makes contact. Always use an oil filter cup wrench with an extension and a ratchet.<br>  <br>  One small tip for the future. If the filter is mounted in a vertical position slowly fill it as full as possible with fresh oil *before installing back on the car. Reason being, a filled oil filter prevents dry starts.|`|zOIgzIy4aa	it could cause the filter to leak and besides that it could be hard to get back off.|`|jieKgKF1aa	u should always wipe the oil filter sealing surface clean them smear a little oil on filter sealing ring with finger, then tighten filter to seal contacts surface then at least a half turn more. start your engine and check for oil leaks u have most likely got it right this time but next time follow correct procedure and u will never have a problem.|`|bqLvWpcZaa	It likely won't cause any problems while this filter is on the engine but the next time you do an oil change ( or get it done by a shop ), the old seal may stick to the block or oil filter housing.  If that happens, the surface area will need to be cleaned and all the old pieces of the seal will need to be removed before installing the new filter.  If that is not done, oil leaks will likely occur.|`|dip4oxB5aa	oil on the ring is a good thing to keep the filter tight over time, but it sounds like you tightened it well.  <br>  I wouldnt stress out over it.  In a week or two look under the vehicle and look for any oil leaks.  <br>  When you go to the shop to get your oil changed they dont care.  THey dont oil the ring.  And most of the time there is no leaking. <br>  Relax|`|6874b4a9b2e07ebd35f4e979f869b2d4aa	Yep, the seal will stick to your engine block. I had a roommate who did this and when he changed it the next time there were gaps where the rubber had stuck and oil sprayed out everywhere. Just remember the next time you change it and run your finger around the edge to make sure it is smooth.|`|GAMkUH9Taa	It shouldn't cause a problem but it is always a good idea to moisten the gasket before screwing on the new filter. What is a problem is that you screwed it on as tight as you could... you are only suppose to tighten an oil filter 3/4 to 1 turn after the gasket contacts the metal that it seats to. I would get another filter right away and do it right, if you wait you may have a very very hard time getting it off the next time around.|`|iR3rrjciaa	should be fine. got a fram filter with the grip? your going to have a hell of a time getting it off. but, when it comes down to getting it off for the next oil change, if you cant get it off dont be afraid to use pliers go ahead and ruin the old filter its being changed anyhow. good luck. you did a good job, next time just tighten it a tad bit less should be half-a turn tightened more than normal hand tightened.|`|efad8b1ede4a36c25f7ed32273efa609aa	Rule of thumb. If you DO NOT wipe the mounting surface clean of oil then you DO NOT need to add oil to the sealing ring. Wont hurt anything just always make sure the old sealing ring comes off with the old filter or you WILL have problems

pZvJpuJTaa	A lot depends on who your dealing with.  Is this your carrier or the liable carrier (of the person that hit you)?  <br>  <br>  With your own carrier you have some leverage due to being a 1st party claim.  They don't 'make you whole' again.  They owe actual cash value for the vehicle.  For special paint to even be considered, it has to be within a certain period of time and you must present a receipt.  You can try to locate your own comps and then negotiate the amount.  Also, most policies have an appraisal clause which you can invoke.<br>  <br>  If this is with the liable carrier, you'll have a difficult time budging them.  They are not contracted with you and literally don't give a hoot what you think your vehicles worth.  They locate comps and usually that's the bottom line.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you!!|`|dPLkNRNuaa	No insurance company is going to cover the dealer fee.

That means what the car reasonably could have sold for given it's age, condition and mileage. <br>  <br>  Ask them to send you a copy of the market survey they ran so you can review it. If it did not pull up enough suitable comps - they can run it again with a larger search radius. This should result in more vehicles being used to base the market survey value.<br>  <br>  EDIT: the market survey program I use (Total Logic) - I can't select the cars. It picks cars that have sold (dealers and private sales). <br>  <br>  The paint job...is this something that you paid for? If so - give them a copy of the receipt. Most market survey programs will let you add in for this type of thing. You put in the date of the item and the cost. The program gives a credit based on this info. <br>  <br>  A special paint job may not add to the value of your car.  Cars are not investments. Many things that are done to them to customize the car...you do because you like it. In most cases you don't get your money back out of it. But, if you have the receipt - see if they will run the market survey again considering that info.

If you are under the age of 18, your parent or your legal guardian must sign the consent section of your form MV-44 (Driver License Application). Your parent or legal guardian can sign the form before you bring it to a DMV office. Your parent or legal guardian is not required to go to the DMV office with you to sign form MV-44.

ZLSDqCnsaa	Okay when you are looking for a car..  You want to look at a number of things.. First thing would be the outside.. You want to look under it for any oil spots or leaking fluids.. Then look at the body.. look at the alignment of the hood, trunk, doors, etc.. You wanna look to see if the gap on each side is equal.. If your hood is shifted one way or another it shows signs that it has been in a possible wreck before.. (which could cause other problems down the road) Then you could also look inside at the gauges.. Make sure they all work.. And if you are able to drive the car.. You want to drive it around town (stop and go kinda traffic) and get the car nice and warm.. make sure it holds temperature pretty well.. Then once it is nice and hot.. take it on the highway.. make sure it is shifting correctly and everything works.. make sure the alignment is accurate by letting go of the wheel and seeing if it coasts one way or the other.. But make sure the road you test it on is flat.. <br>  <br>  <br>  I think that is all I can think of..<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope I can help..|`|IzNOEyQOaa	If you are looking for a in the $2000 price range i promise you you will find everything justin listed wrong how nice of a car can you get for two grand you know the old saying "you get what you pay for"|`|JkTGq2BJaa	i have a friend that bought a car from a police auction.

Z13CWyNGaa	Assuming your talking about an import, its also a question of tuning... You may see any where from a 3hp gain to a 3hp loss just because the ECU is tuned to the original intake, that is it is tuned based on how much air it knows will flow through the original intake. Lets say you put on a larger intake with higher flow, the ECU will think its getting a certain amount of air but its actually getting more, so in this case it'll be running a little lean. You richen up the mixture and you may see 4 to 10 hp depending on the vehicle. That leaves you with restrictions from the cylinder head and valves. To make good use of aftermarket intake and exhaust, you need to port the cylinder head and change the cam. Its really a alot of work to see a real difference. If aren't planning on do to much to this car, I wouldn't spend the money...|`|e0TNrx76aa	it all depends on the application you are going to use it in. if you want gas mileage then use a o.e. intake. if you want performance then an aftermarket intake would be the best. aem is in my opinion better on a honda than some other intakes. remember do you want more top end or more low end torque?? different intakes will give you different results.|`|hRDHF6SEaa	are you looking to increase power.you wont get much either way sinse your valves in the head remain the same.you will get some better performance with the origional if you or somone took the manifold and hit the ports with a die grinder and cleaned and rounded out the rough edges.if you want to spend then upgrade the manifold and increase jet size in carb.or if injected have them inlarged.yes,they can increase fuel flow.|`|7a5085b19b90c46573ae023bb4086356aa	Generally, yes.|`|51d9e39c71aaaed7424c9ac49e9069c5aa	Give us a hint?

Example, if its a 2 channel amplifier, and they are single voice coil, its safe to assume an amp that does 300x2 @ 4 ohms will provide 150x2 @ 8 ohms.|`|L0H4iVHWaa	no, those subs are rated at 150 rms watts, if you wire them in series/parrallel you will get a 4 ohm load which will receive 600rms watts<br>  when you wire those 2 8 ohm subs you will get a 4 ohm load... you will be overpowering them by double their rms ratings which will eventually cause them to blow, you want an amp that puts out 300 rms watts @ 4ohms.<br>  <br>  _________________________<br>  edit:<br>  <br>  by the way, your wrong about "Because the subs are 8 ohm I believe I need twice the rms wattage." thats not true, 8 ohms is less resistant than 4 ohms would be, therefor you would need half the rms wattage and not TWICE the rms wattage

lM9NvSwnaa	Well it looks like you'll be rebuilding the engine real soon now.  Since you have no compression it is either the piston is holed, the rings are broke, the sleeve is gouged, the valve train dropped or the crank broke.  In any case, you will need to tear down the top end (at the least) and have a look see at what needs to be done.  It could be simple like a piston ring broke and gouged the sleeve in which case, buy a new sleeve, have a machine shop install it, then buy a new set of rings and rebuild.  If there is evidence of major malfunction-this will involve further disection of the engine and careful examination to find the cause and also to clean out the metal components that have fallen down into the cases.<br>  <br>  Of course your other option is to buy a new engine and install it.  The up side, your frame and suspension is good.  Your carb is good, so it is just the engine giving you problems.|`|UXAjzdl2aa	its best to test it with a compression gauge.<br>  plug the gauge in, and somehow, crank the motor, to see what it reads, then add say a spoon of motor oil in the piston where the spark plug does, and re check the compression. if you get more compression with oil, then the piston rings are shot.<br>  if no change, you are looking at damaged valves, or a broken piston thats beyond repair.|`|AA10690306	The only thing I know of that will cause 0 compression is a hole either in the piston or cylinder.  If it is the cylinder it can not be repaired.  If it is in the piston then all you have to do is replace the piston and rings and clean the metal out of the case.  Although if you broke out the valve chamber it might give you 0 compression, that could be fixed by cleaning all the metal out of the case, changing the piston and rings and replacing the entire top end including valves.<br>  <br>  Edit   Go with Janice's advice!|`|aQBmBjG6aa	Hey there to answer your question you "blew" up the motor as we call it. 2 strokes are very easy to work on. All you need to do is pull the jug off and check out exzactly what you did to it. Alot of the time you want to replace your rings before it gets to that point. You are more than likely going to need to bring the jug in to get it bored out. depending how bad you scarred it up you may need to go 20 thousands or more to get the grooves out of it. and you will obviously need to purchase a new oversized piston and rings which the bigger you go the more they cost. Also I suggest after a new rebuild that you put a compression checker on it and see what you are at. kick it over several times to acheive maximum pressure. once you figure out what max compression is test it after every couple rides. Once it gets to 30 pounds below the max it is time to replace your rings. This will save you all sorts of money in bores and pistons. I usually can re-ring my bike 2 or 3 times before purchasing a new piston. You should rarely have to bore it out. That is a last resort.  Hope this helped.
SVxxJuecaa	as long as the offset is the same you will be ok. the tire will be just a little thiner and not as wide but its not even noticeable. just check the RIM WILL FIT if the rim is from the same car it will if its not it might not fit but double check it online or try the rim on before you buy it
32NNhLzEaa	Okay, Ferdinand Porsche created the car, but we cant just end it there. Hitler had some hand in it, but he came some 15 years later. The idea started when Porsche believed that everyone should be able to afford a car. After working at several different car companies, he went to work at Mercedes. Mercedes believed in large touring cars, so when he presented the idea for a small car, they rejected it. He then left and went for work for another car company, but soon after Mercedes bought them too. He then went to work for the Wander auto company, which would later become 1 of the 4 auto makers to become auto union, or AUDI. There he built 3 slope reared cars for them because he believed the cars of the day were not areodynamic enough. Afterwards, he went to work for the Zundaft motorcycle company. THere he designed the rear engined, air-cooled, rear-sloping car for Zundaft motorcycle company. But Zundaft was sponsored by Fritz Numyer, and he stressed a 5 cylinder watercooled engine, with disappointing results. They then withdrew funding and wrote the rights over to Mr. Porsche, who then went to work for the NSU motorcycle company. He then created the NSU Type 32 Volksauto prototype, where he was satisfied and felt his dream was fulfilled. However, when NSU inked a deal with Fiat to build only motorcycles, the NSU prototype was scraped. Only through a fellow race car driver and friend did he finally meet the man who would help him make is dream a reality, Adolf Hitler. <br>  <br>  Hitler forced all the German auto companies to fund the KDF-Wagen (Strengh through Joy car, as it was called by Hitler) and build a factory in lower Saxony (later called Wolfsburg) to produce the car. He promised a car to everyone in Germany, if they sent some money into the German Government. They were sent a stampbook and would be assigned a KDF-wagen number, and when they had the right number of stamps and books they would get the car.  When WWII broke out, the factory produced the Kubelwagen and the Swimmwagen for the German Army, both Porsches designs. After the war, the British took over the factory, and put in charge Major Ivan Hurst to get the factory back up and running. When he did this successfully, the British handed the factory over to the West German Government, who appointed Hienz Nordoff to oversee beetle production. His do not change, no frills approch made it the most sucessful car in the world. <br>  <br>  Sorry for the history lesson, but as you can see, while Porsche technically created it, many people had a hand in "inventing" it.|`|EmgiGg17aa	Google it. rather than Yahoo it.  It is a Porche design.  That is why some Porche parts fit on a VW.<br>      The only reason Hitler was involved is because he was the leader in government at the time(so finances was not a problem) who desired a German built car for the average German person.    He wanted it simple, and sips gas, and rugged.    A car(wagen) for the common "volks"(folks) eg volkswagen(peoples car).  Got to remember that roads were dirt wagen trails and paths.  Cobblestone in the cities(which are very bumpy)<br>      The Model T in America drove on the same type of roadways.<br>    No government leader has wanted a car affordable for the average American (the  Nixon-mobile, the Carter-cruiser, the Bush-wagen).   As it was Hitler did not put his name on it as it was the "peoples car"<br>    Even the car models were commonplace naming Type1,Type2,Type3,Type4.   Schwimwagen means a swimming car.  So only descriptive names.<br>     Got to remember that much of the English language is derived from Germanic roots (words that start with sch) or did they not teach you that is school?|`|addaf7237cf3d32190cfc96546e98709aa	Ferdinand Porsche.<br>  <br>  He made the first VW, the VW Beetle(Bug)<br>  <br>  Then he started another company, Porsche.<br>  <br>  Adolf Hitler threatened to kill Ferdinand Porsche if he did not design a car for him to use in the war. So Ferdinand Porsche was forced to make a car for war or else he would be killed.-He designed the VW Beetle, which was able to foat in water and was light weight so it could do well offroad. <br>  <br>  Back then, America used Jeeps and Germany used Beetles. <br>  <br>  More than 70 years later, the VW Beetle is one of the worlds best selling cars.

hXk1JGj2aa	if your battery is tested and is good then i would say that the sound system or other accesories are draining it, but since your alternator is good you could rule that out to an extent. My best guess is one of your accessories is draining while your vehicle is off, maybe have a short to ground that isn't enought to blow a fuse but drain the battery or maybe one of the stero componets possibly the amp remains on after cd player or car is turnedoff. Try making sure the Remote line from the back of the cd player is connect to the corisponding attachment on the amp.|`|ozwLZwXeaa	If you have all that extra electronics in your car<br>  I would install a separate battery in the trunk or under the hood for all that extra stuff.

Call him to see what the toggle switches go to. Could be very interesting to find that out. Check the glove department to see if old paperwork with former owners name is there. Use your computer to find him.|`|iR3rrjciaa	it probably went to interior light, fog lights, subwoofers, or under body lights. whatever it was it is probably gone now, people usually take all that stuff off before they sell a car. just rip it out or off. or maybe see where they went then take it out.|`|bqLvWpcZaa	Could be anything really.  Either try them out yourself to see what happens or call up the person you bought the car from and ask him/her.<br>  My first guess would be either some fog/auxiliary lamps or part of a security system.|`|CmdTQlEeaa	They could be Fog light switches or even better Lift switches like the rappers have in the hood. :)  You can make your car go up, down, and bounce all over. YES!|`|ZLSDqCnsaa	Flip them and see what they do.. hahaha.. thats what i'd do..

54jCmmI4aa	Both the Toyota RAV4 and the Honda CR-V are excellent vehicles. They both are on AutoOnInfo.net's very selective list of the Best of 2009 based on reliability over the past 10 years; however, only the Toyota RAV4 is on AutoOnInfo.net's list of the Best of 2009 based on reliability over the past 5 years. The Composite Reliability Value of the Toyota RAV4 is a perfect +1.00 on a scale of -1.00 to +1.00.<br>  <br>  The Jeep Liberty is on AutoOnInfo.net's list of the Worst of 2009 with a Composite Reliability Value of -.50.|`|babc9321f16ad1df436756176709e0c5aa	I personally like the RAV although mine is older.  I have a 96 with 175,000 miles that other than routine maintenance has never needed any other work.  I understand the need for 4wd we have two front wheel drive cars along with the RAV there is no comparison on their ability levels in the snow and ice.|`|pI4fF4n8aa	You should consider a Ford Escape. Ford's Control-Trac 4x4 system monitors wheel slip 1000x a second. The 2005 escape got a more powerful 4 cylinder engine that gets 24 mpg city 29 mpg highway, overall 1 mpg better than a CRV and the same as a RAV4.|`|DGR7FNOXaa	Rav4 very clean and easy to drive car|`|PHlcM9YFaa	What Town you live that you need 4WD to get around in it?|`|hdfWorYkaa	i'd go with the crv based on looks, but if you want good gas mileage and space id go with the rav4. jeep probably gets the worst gas mileage and theyre kinda ugly in my opinion.|`|PJZRGsc3aa	why not get FWD, better gas mpg considering your looking for it.

03fiqGJwaa	that is so wrong i cannot hardly type.<br>  <br>  the zx2 has a much lower gearset which will make it much faster off the line and up to about 130mph|`|7BHIyMFmaa	They are pretty close in real-world performance. With the stick shift DSM being slightly quicker. I'd say it's driver's race. The newer (2000-2009) models with the 2.4L have about 25-35 more HP than the old 2.0L non-turbo and will likely beat a ZX2 unless the driver misses a shift or something..<br>  <br>  Edit : Lets see here:<br>  <br>  Transmission ratios for the ZX2<br>  G5M <br>  1st  3.310 <br>  2nd 1.830 <br>  3rd 1.310 <br>  4th 0.970<br>  5th 0.750 (Probe2.5L/Escort ZX2 2.0L) <br>  Final 4.10<br>  <br>  For the 2G Non-Turbo 2.0L DSM<br>  1st  3.54<br>  2nd 2.13<br>  3rd 1.36<br>  4th 1.03<br>  5th 0.81<br>  Final 3.94<br>  <br>  Even with the shorter axle ratio the Eclispe is still geared shorter than the ZX2. The ZX2 does have a weight advantage, however, the Eclispe has an extra 10 HP, a slight  torque advantage and shorter gearing. So like I said earlier, it would be a driver's race. Next time do some research before you post, noob.
r1D9P4Vyaa	The 373`s for mileage. 411`s and 456`s are more for the low end torque for the mudding & playing but with the 35" tires I think the 373`s would be the best combo for both on & off road.

Gn0nR2S1aa	Should be a retaining clip on the coupler holding the line in.|`|AA10419188	Don't throw away the dynamite just yet!  Do you have the nuts loose on both ends (or connectors), - I haven't taken one of this model apart, so fasteners on ends may be different than common "screw in flarenuts"! So if fasteners are now turned free, - then you might have to bend metal line enough to pull one end out of its seat!  Should not be a big deal to bend back far enough to get nuts started into bores on both ends again, -- do not tighten anything till both ends in fittings,- and pulled down to near seating! -- If you tighten one end all the way first, - it may be hard to get the other one started and position the line properly too!.. Under extreme conditions, it has been known to cause metal line to fracture later on down the line!|`|qgaVun7Vaa	Most of the high pressure lines need to be removed with what is called a LINE WRENCH. Most box end wrenchs round the 6 sided metal line fittings.   This line wrench has a small opening slot just big enough to get it over the metal line coupler but yet around more than the average box end wrench.  Now keep in mind when you change this metal line you will need to bleed your slave cylinder.  And that usually takes two people or a brake bleeder kit.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind to make sure the clutch fork is adiquitely in the ball or cup it rests in before reinstalling the slave cylinder.
qjg0g5WMaa	ok let me try to help first take compressed air blow the garbage out of the fitting then try the tool maybe use a little wd-40 also after pushing in hose then insert tool but your prablems stems from dirt/dust being in your way also look for a rool pin that is drove in as a saftey some will have this some wont <br>  goodluck|`|RTBvQJHbaa	Well I could probably help if you gave me what vehicle its in?  Have you check for a snap ring/retaining ring?  It may just be inside and be a grommet.  I don't know I can't say because I don't know anything other then 97 chevy.|`|a8m3HdDHaa	This won't help much tonight but go to the GM dealer tomorrow and ask to look at the service manual.  That will tell what kind of tool is supposed to release the fitting.|`|GeOMJN4Daa	I just did my truck and had the same problem. You will see a plastic ring around where it connects to the slave cylinder. you have to push it all the way down with a special tool. It has to be compressed evenly. If you are replacing the slave cylinder. I break off the stem on the slave cylinder to make it easier to get to.|`|AA10419188	I have heard of something like this on one of my brothers trucks a couple years ago.  Possibly it only comes apart on slave cylinder end, -- as the upper fitting may come as part of master assembly!  All I remember is That he had to buy a new master cylinder because the upper fitting leaked, or the hose leaked (can't remember which), -- he has died since, so I can't ask him now!  He was pretty upset, because by the time he was done it cost him about $300 to get it all fixed! Dealer did it, as he was too "messed up" to do the stuff anymore!

Buy something you can afford.|`|JkTGq2BJaa	I think there is no rule that said the dealer has to get your financing for you. take the paperwork and see if you can get it squared away your self. If you signed the title over to them for your car you sold it to them and they have the right to sell it. worse case is you return the new car and they have to give you the cash instead of your old car back. I'm surprised they let you drive the car that long without financing.|`|WxmNSxNGaa	You are under the misconception that your trade and purchase of a new car was a single transaction. It was not. You signed the papers and SOLD them your trade in. That's a done deal and cannot be changed if they don't agree to it. You made the mistake of selling them your car before you were approved for a loan. Granted, this is a mistake many people make, but it's a mistake none the less. Take this as a lesson learned. In the future NEVER take delivery of a new car or give up your trade before your financing is approved.<br>  <br>  Good luck getting this resolved, but you're not getting your trade back, and you won't win if you sue them.

5295ce0578e5f91d2c73b820d4289eceaa	1 sub or 2?<br>  That's a good match if you are only using one 4 ohm SVC sub. If you are using two subs then that is not a good match. Two subs together will handle 500 watts RMS but can only be wired to a 2 ohm or 8 ohm load. If wired to a 2 ohm load that amp will send them 1200 watts. (I'm assuming you made a typo when you said the amp is 1200W Max@2 ohm because 500W RMS@4 ohm would yield around 1000W RMS@2 ohm, you should ALWAYS go by RMS not Max)<br>  If you series two 4 ohm subs together for an 8 ohm load then the amp will deliver around 250W RMS or 125W per subwoofer which won't hurt anything but you will not be getting the power you need or want.

32dffe7e0eba9eb2c4e6c9418ec99ba5aa	It only seems absurd to you because you want your sister to receive money.<br>  <br>  Some jurisdictions may require insurance, others not.  Even where insurance is required, it may not be of a type that pays money to passengers, much less to next of kin of passengers.<br>  <br>  Your brother-in-law could have verified that the pilot was insured, as part of his investigation into whether or not the pilot was safe.<br>  <br>  Biplanes may be designated as experimental in some cases, which makes them very difficult to insure.  Rented aircraft may be covered by insurance taken out by the company that owns them, and the pilot need only meet certain criteria in order to be covered by the insurance.<br>  <br>  Many people do things without insurance even when it is required.  Many people drive without mandatory insurance.  Some things in life involve risk, and risk cannot be completely eliminated.  Had your brother-in-law really wanted to go the safe route, he would have stayed out of the biplane—insurance would not have prevented the accident that killed him.|`|zlPAVkUBaa	I'm very sorry. If he was going for a ride in a personal airplane and not paying any fees, the I'm not sure if the owner would have insurance to cover that. He should have it if he is charging fees for a ride, but that doesn't mean he isn't cheating the system. If the aircraft is part of a company, then they may be liable.<br>  <br>  Even if the pilot didn't have insurance, I'm sure a lawyer would take a look at what his estate is worth and try to get some of that, given he will make 40%.<br>  <br>  I am guessing that your brother-in-law did not have his own life insurance. If he did, they would have to pay that, and probably accidental death benefits.|`|EDnT0y8caa	Sorry about your loss, but do you ask everyone you ride in a car with to show you their insurance policy? No, you just assume they are properly insured. It's too bad the pilot did not have proper insurance. At minimum he should have had liability insurance but there is no law requiring it. However, if the plane was being operated commercially (for hire), then the company owning the plane would have been required to have insurance.<br>  <br>  There is no law absolutely requiring insurance on privately owned aircraft however, because planes are Federally licensed and the states have no jurisdiction over private aircraft in regards to passing insurance requirement laws except in regards to businesses. Likewise, insurance laws are the domain of the states, so the Federal government has no legal authority to impose insurance requirements except where interstate commerce is concerned.<br>  <br>  The "safety net" is usually with the banks. If the aircraft was subject to a bank loan, the bank would have required proof of insurance, but just like car owners, dishonest airplane owners can drop insurance payments after the plane has been purchased. It often takes a bank months to learn that the owner is no longer paying for insurance. <br>  <br>  Sadly, it is up to a passenger in a private plane to ensure that the owner is properly insured. Non-commercial airplane insurance is actully cheaper than most car insurance. I carry a 3 million dollar liability policy on my aircraft ($600,000 per passenger medical payments) and it only costs me $700 per year. <br>  <br>  The only recourse your sister has is to hire a lawyer and sue the estate of the pilot or owner of the aircraft.|`|AA12349768	Unlike automobiles, there are no laws in any state that requires privately owned and operated aircraft to be insured. In some instances owners of aircraft with little experience can not get insurance for the aircraft they fly, so they operate with no insurance. It's not very smart but many do. In the hangars where I keep my aircraft the property owner requires proof of liability insurance to rent the hangar, when he started this I would guess sixty percent of the aircraft owners did not have any insurance! Some feel if it were legally mandated that the insurance company's would take advantage and charge exuberant rates.|`|o5KbZk1saa	Here in Canada it is the law.<br>  You must have a minimum of $1,000,000 liability insurance to legally fly.<br>  That even applies to ultra-lights.|`|JZSqKyhiaa	there is a law that states that no one should operate or even turn a plane on unless its insured>but inevitably people break laws and the same as if someone drove a car without insurance>>ur screwed basically

He then did training to become an astronaut as well.  Education is a critical issue if you want to fly in space!  In this day and time you will find it very difficult to even become a "test pilot" with out college.<br>  <br>  So yes you can be a "test pilot" and become an astronaut, but not without "finishing" your education!<br>  <br>  If you want to learn more about it try this site<br>  <a href="http://www.kennedyspacecenter.com/astronaut-training-experience.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.kennedyspacecenter.com/astron...</a><br>  and<br>  <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/externalflash/Astro_class/Astro_class.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.nasa.gov/externalflash/Astro_...</a><br>  (just read the backgrounds!)|`|zlPAVkUBaa	You wouldn't be a test pilot if you hadn't finished your education.

ruenEu8Yaa	sry but i dont see any spelling mistakes PERSON WHO SAID HE HAD TERRIBLE SPELLING. lol... i will answer as seriously as i can.<br>  but it is best to lay off the caffeine a little jk lol... <br>  <br>  1st, flight training is what you make it based on the flight school you choose (college/local airport/accelerated school etc.) and the instructor you choose.<br>  2nd, also, this is dependant on what flight school you choose whether it be a college or accelerated school and so on.  if you go to a college, you can expect to have your private pilot license in about a semester. accelerated flight schools advertise anywhere from 2 weeks to a month to get the license.  keep in mind though, if you go to an accelerated flight school, you will be flying pretty much 6-8 hrs a day. everyday.  and if you go to ur local airport, how long ur training takes is based almost completely on your financial situation.  if you can afford to fly every day, then you will finish alot sooner if you can only afford to fly once a week or once every other week (which is not recommended).  to get your private pilot licens, you must be 17 and have logged a minimum of 40 flight hours.  there are other requirements such as night flying and cross country time and solo time and so on but all that time is used to add up your total flight hours for your license.  i highly recommend you find a local airport and schedule a "discovery flight".  this is a 30 minute "mini lesson" that will introduce you to the plane and flight instructor and is a great way to see if flying is really for you.  these usually run anywhere from $35-$95  <br>  3rd,  i think i described where you can go pretty good in the last two parts.<br>  <br>  hope this helped!|`|htBHCNDtaa	You have the attention span of a goldfish, I'd highly doubt you'd graduate, assuming you'd ever find a way to apply for a course.|`|z3BxHrMpaa	You may want to check out this link:<br>  <a href="http://www.aopa.org/letsgoflying/?priority=SX08BAP" rel="nofollow">http://www.aopa.org/letsgoflying/?priori...</a>

e08zWhUjaa	man oh man.. many things influence buying a car.. I myself am very into cars...  and have owned many different kinds... here they are in the order i owned them ( i think that order says a a lot)  Ford pinto, Honda civic, Fiat x1/9,Pontiac firebird,Ttoyota corolla, Mazda b210 pickup, Honda CRX, VW jetta, VW passat, Jeep Cherokee,VW passat, BMW 328i, Toyota Camry, Infiniti J30, Mazda MX6, Saab 900s convertible, Infiniti G35 coupe, Saab 9-3 ( currently driving )  so yea... all kind of cars all kind of styles...Your influence will change with age...  Also your finances dictate what you can afford....to both buy and keep running...<br>  <br>  Climate does have a bit to do with choice at least for me.. i mean i owned a BMW when i lived in the south but due to the rear wheel drive would never own one in a snowy cold climate.  they are just not good in the snow.  I love my BMW ..  but as for dependability... you gotta have some money in the bank if you plan on keeping it beyond its 36K/3yr warranty period.  also it was my favorite car - BUT have to say i think i was influenced a lot by its status... ( it handled incredible tho ) ..  over all I'd have to say my ultimate favorite was the Saab convertible - it was intelligent, fairly conservative, had plenty of room and sexy as hell with the top down....it also isnt a real popular car but has a very kewl Euro look about it.. other thing is the resale on them isnt the greatest so buying a late model used one is a steal.. when I got the convertible it had 34K miles on it was under 4 years old and i paid under 16k for it.. a total steal and  I loved the car...I also bought both inifiniti;s on Ebay.. the G35 coupe had 11 k on it and was a year old...<br>  <br>  deal is do your research.. check consu,er reports, kelly blue book and read all the reviews on the car that you can....it will save you money and heartache in the long run.. also think with your head  - cant tell you how many cars i bought because of the sexiness of the care only to realize thr attraction only lasted less then a year and i tired of them ( G35 coupe. MAzda MX6 and the pontiac firebird to name a few)  Other thing is gas mileage...  for example.. going form teh g35 coupe to the saab 9-3 got me an extra 6-7 miles a gallon... not as much of a concern when it happened but 2 years later when gas was almost 4 bucks it meant about 50 bucks a month....and damn my old honda crx ( in 1991 ) got 35 miles to the gallon... no hybrid , no gadgets.. just a regular model... <br>  <br>  so deal with how cool a car is... is how it makes you feel...dont care what others think... only car how you feel.....  good luck.. I  Love and Hate buying cars.... but it is an addiction....|`|M79W3Ct9aa	Where they live is usually a big one.  People that live in snowy areas feel compelled that they need something with 4WD or AWD, usually at least a midsize SUV.  Unfortunately, 4WD traction really doesn't do anything more that a good set of snow tires won't do.<br> <br> Some want something sporty looking that will attract a lot of attention.  "Popularity" is usually created because of a good track record for whatever reason.  Corvette has been big because its a inexpensive powerful RWD V8 sport coupe that could potentially compete with the exotic supercars.  Same with the Dodge Viper.  Spend just a little more cash than the domestic price tags, then you can get a nice Porsche.  People with money usually go for these cars.<br> <br> On the other side, the Honda Civic and Accord has been popular because of superb reliability record and cheap to own and maintain.  Also, people who want to make a fast import for not a lot of money go to Honda because its pretty easy, cheap, and the cars can be made a lot lighter (and they're already pretty light).<br> <br> Some want a fast, rather inexpenive car that is already put together well out of the box and don't wanna invest in the turbo and engine upgrades to make it really fast like with the Hondas above.  Cars like the Impreza WRX and Neon SRT-4 are good since they come with stock turbos and the engine is already equipped to handle it.  In fact these kind of cars usually can handle a little more boost than what the stock turbo gives.  Some look to the German cars since they probably have the most strongest engines in the world.  Stock internals in the 1.8 turbo used in the Audi and VW cars can handle up to 600 horsepower.  Upgrade an A4 really well and you could kill a stock STi.  Speaking of STi, some may want more stock power than these subcompacts so the STi comes to mind.  300 horsepower stock and you can bump that another 50 with a boost controller.  Other cars in that power range will have twin turbos like the 300 ZX, Mitsubishi 3000 GT or the domestic counterpart of that 3000 GT, the Dodge Stealth.  My neighbor used to have a twin turbo Dodge Stealth, black with black rims, black leather, tinted windows, T-Tops, twin dual exhausts that had to be 3 1/2 inches in diameter cuz it was loud as hell.  Man that thing was sexy!<br> <br> Some wand a sleek or aggresive design.  Pontiac is one that comes to mind.  Examples are the Firebird or better yet Trans-Am.  Also their supercharged sedans Grand Prix GTP and Bonneville SSEi.  I've always loved the Pontiac looks, feel they're one of the most aggresive looking cars you could buy.  And their cars have the performance to back it up.  GM engines are pretty good for giving you a lot of torque for good acceleration off the line and the Pontiac V6 and V8 engines are no exception.  <br> <br> I don't wanna ramble on further, but there really is no one who chooses what is "cool" and what isn't.  Its all about personal taste and that's the beauty of our current automotive selection since there's so many to choose from no matter what you're in the market for.  <br> <br> People get vehicles for many, many reasons, but is usually related to climate or use of the vehicle.|`|ukN9HZ0oaa	I think buying a car is a personal choice, and by far not for everyone. <br>  I dont know about climate having an impact, but design maybe for some people. Many are popular for all types of areas, affordability, fuel economy, safety, style etc...<br>  I think society plays a large part in total for what type is cool or not. But ultimately it should be up to the purchaser to buy one that suits their needs.

From my knowledge, no it is not illegal. It would only be illegal if your friend's insurance policy specifically says that it only covers the owner or if you were driving his car without his consent. If you got into an accident, his insurance would cover his car and his hospital bills, but they won't cover you (unless he has additional coverage). If you have your own car and insurance policy, your insurance should cover your hospital bills, though, even if you weren't in your own car. However, if you were to regularly drive his car (as in, he lets you take his car to work a few times a week or something), then he would need to list you as driver on his policy.<br>  <br>  If you got pulled over, you wouldn't be fined for driving someone else's car as long as you had your driver's license, friend's insurance, registration and the owner's consent (which, since your friend was in the car, it should have been fine. Unless his parents own the car, then you need their consent). You'll only be ticketed or fined for whatever you got pulled over for (speeding, broken tail light, whatever).<br>  <br>  I'm not really sure what your "N" is - never heard of it, so I can't say if it would affect the situation at all. Just be extra careful when driving someone else's car. =o)|`|EGEOOZLXaa	You must be insured to drive a car. However, some plans have a means by which other drivers who are not insured are still covered. You need to check with the insurance company of the owner. If I were you, I would not drive the car if I'm not on the insurance policy. If something happens, you could be in big trouble and the policy would not cover you. Also, the person who owns the car and policy might be in big trouble for putting you at risk without coverage. The whole thing is a big mess if you think about it. <br>  <br>  Bottom line, don't drive a car if you're not covered on the insurance policy. Also, a police officer is the least of your worries. What about a catastrophic accident and your injuries? What about hospital bills in the event you do have an accident?

Someone much shorter might find it difficult to reach the ground.But at my height with boots on it seemed a bit cramped once I put my feet up.<br>  Doesn't look as heavy as a burgman or swing but pretty close.<br>  Taking off, it has okay power, but where the Tmax rocks is if you're going 40mph and you gun it you will launch like a rocket. <br>  The actual ride is sweet. With 15" wheels and a well balanced bike , it is really responsive.<br>  My favorite thing about the Tmax is the brakes. Although not ABS, Yami definately got them right. Best brakes I have ever felt on any scooter or m/c.<br>  Awesome scooter. The only downfalls for me was the lack of legroom , could use a box for more storage.|`|n7jXAQFWaa	If you're asking whether or not you should buy a T-Max and supercharge it, I'd say if money were no object and you can't live without the fastest scooter in town, then go for it. Otherwise, get a motorcycle and spend half as much for a faster vehicle.<br>  <br>  If you're asking about the T-Max in general, the motorcycle.com review is about on par with everything I've read about that scooter. You may also want to consider the Burgman series from Suzuki or the Honda Silver Wing. All are around the same price range and and generally highly reviewed.<br>  <br>  I'm more of a motorcycle guy myself and encourage you to come over to the dark side, but I don't know your experience level or preferences overall. Good luck either way and remember that the whole point of being on two wheels is to have fun.

Plus, stroking this engine will not give you the same advantages, since the bores are small (you can't get the same performance from the heads since the valve sizes will be correspondingly smaller to accommodate the bore).

However, if you're old enough to teach him (as legally allowed by the state) to drive and you think you drive OK, that should be good enough. When he feels like he can drive as well as a licensed driver, then he should take the test.<br>  <br>  Say, how often does he get in the car? Ideally, he should be driving as practice whenever possible - whether it be a typical commute or a full practice session. The idea is to gain experience in real, typical conditions.<br>  <br>  Remember - the written test is unimportant in the big scheme of things. Being able to handle the car safely is more important.

You can check to see if any of them are popped by opening them up. A lot of cars have a feature where they will not allow the car to come out of park if the brake lights do not come on. So you probably can't get it out of park for that reason. You may have a safety override hole near the shifter that you can stick a screwdriver in and manually pull it out of gear. Also check to make sure connections on the battery are good and check to see if the battery has any power. It's a method of narrowing it down as you go.---edit---as far mechanics doing it for free i dont know where you are from but I have never seen free diagnosis before--usually theres an hour labor charge which ranges from 65 and up but different for smaller shops and backyard mechanics

5mCm2XTLaa	Yes, your typical stock motor needs a certain amount of back pressure to run properly. Running it without an exhaust system will quickly ruin the engine. First of all it will run too lean, second cold air can get to the valves when the engine is shut down causing them to warp.|`|HQrMEkm0aa	I hope you still have the Cat. converter on the exhaust system.

gOQ5mZ7Xaa	Well the main reason why people get lift kits on their 4WDs is because it makes it easier getting over rocks, debris, and other sort of off-roading obstacles. As a daily driver though it wouldn't be in best interest to get one. If you do you should fit higher-profile, wider tyres to compensate for traction loss as well as stiffen up the suspension. My dad has this same setup on his 1995 Nissan Patrol and he uses it both as a daily driver and an off-roader, handles great and isn't tipped easily. If your car is already relatively wide it'll hold the road better. So yes the ride quality is changed, but with the right compensation you can prevent it from changing dramatically.|`|kY3waNn1aa	ABSOLUTELY YOU WILL HAVE MUCH HARDER RIDE AND SWAYING IF ITS NOT DONE RIGHT|`|PdOrdmvcaa	Yes it will ride differently .<br>  <br>  The cab wont feel so rigid to the frame as it is factory .<br>  <br>  And if you ever hit some thing modestly hard it will be real bad .<br>  <br>  Body lifts leave ugly gaps at the front and rear bumpers also.<br>  <br>  You can fill them in with sheet metal to hide them .....but....yuck.<br>  <br>  Body lifts are more for "decorative" trucks .<br>  <br>  If you will be riding hard you will benefit much more from the durability of a suspension lift.<br>  <br>  They are cheap though .<br>  <br>  But like I'm saying, the application actually weakens the structural grid by putting spacers in between the body and frame.|`|VFTn5MVtaa	It increases the chance of a roll over if not done properly, you are rising the center of gravity of the vehicle and so even if done properly you have increased the chance of a roll over.

Since this has probably never been done (and for good reason) it will have to be taken to the fabricator so the engine can be mocked up inside of the car and leveled.

sCqdisvnaa	I'm assuming this is an E36 3-series model, and the symptom is the key turns freely without engaging the starter?<br>  <br>  If so, you need a new lock cylinder.  That's a dealer-only part, because you'll want a lock cylinder that matches your existing keys.  Figure on $75-$100 for the cylinder.  Installation can be DIY, or a couple of hours at the dealer.<br>  <br>  There's a lot of information online if you google the problem and instructions on how to fix it.  Check websites like bimmerforums.com, and there's also a great You Tube video:
AA12261615	you may need to pull the dash out on this one check it they was bad to get burnt spots in them and cause a temporary loss of power and this would cause them to reset every time they did it,this may be a one time event but if it happens again check for a loose ground wire or bad connection,good luck.
gOQ5mZ7Xaa	I don'ta speaka ya language.
fjHpA5oiaa	1. Start by cleaning the posts on top of the battery completely. This might even mean changing out battery terminal ends. Make sure they are tight, especially the negative. 2. Initially you are starting your car on the first start with the cold cranking amp. (There are two amp ratings on your battery, one says CCA and that is the Cold Cranking Amps) If you have a low number there, that means you have low amps (cheap) in the cold crank department. You could get a better battery with higher CCA ratings. 3. If that doesn't work and it's still sluggish, if you can get it to fire and run, turn your headlights on and then pull the negative battery terminal, not touching ANYTHING with the terminal other than rubber, plastic, open air (don't fry your whole system). If the car dies or changes radically in the way it runs, replace the alternator.  4. It could be your ignition. You could slide some graphite on the key, and put it into the ignition, the graphite acts as a lubricant. Sometimes ignitions get sticky. 5. If all that hasn't worked, we'll talk about the starter. Turn the key to the "on" position, take a flashlight and a long flathead screwdriver, touch the steel shank of the screwdriver to the back of the starter (under the hood, or in some vans, you have to pull the bubble out of the middle of the front seat console), bridging from bendix (small round node on the side of the starter about 1/3 the size of the whole starter) to the starter  battery terminal post. Make that connection. It will arc like a big dog, don't be afraid. Quickly you will be able to tell, when you hit, you might have to move the screwdriver around, it should *snap*, engaging the starter gear forward. But if all you hear is the clicking of the bendix OR the starter gear spinning without engaging the flywheel, your starter is probably going out, and get a new one. 5. You might need to take the 418 Woofers out of the back, the 4 21" Godfathers you have out of there, because you have way too much thump in the hump, and your battery couldn't keep up.<br>  <br>  The beautiful thing about 1996 and newer is you've got a universal plug for any diagnostic right above your knees tucked up under the dash,   its shaped like a squished rectangle, maybe with a cover to plug your instrument into. Ask a buddy or go to Autozone and borrow their engine diagnostic, it will give you a code that you look up in the book, or it might even just tell you the problem. But if you're not getting the engine light, the diagnostic might not pick any problems up. Rock on.|`|ozwLZwXeaa	You should check the fuel pump to see if it is working. Mine was like that and it was that darned old fuel pump needing to be replaced. The starter may also have a chipped tooth that might be something except why would it start up when it is warmed up? The in line fuel filter may have a plug in it of crud out of the gas. Then after it runs for awhile the plug moves on into your engine. Could be any one of these. So my suggestion is to take it to a shop where they will put your car on a machine that searches out the problem for you.  It costs around $45.00 but it may save you lots more than that if someone tries to sell you parts you don't need. Call around and get estimates on how much they charge for that test.

It is possible there is internal corrosion in the cables which can't be seen which results in a poor connection.|`|ND1nFEWSaa	if the battery is like 3 or more years this is your problem,you just cannot look at a battery and decide it is ok, the internal plates are corroded and this cuts the amps in half
TiRQpnXuaa	There are lots of places where you can get a free insurance quote. <a href="http://www.goodinternetdeals.com/Auto-Insurance.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.goodinternetdeals.com/Auto-In...</a> It only takes 5 minutes to do.|`|fQBfjdz1aa	I've not heard of this before.  <br>  <br>  If you choose to use their body shop it is usually a much better deal for all involved.  Some insurance companies will get a small discount, usually 5%.  But you get something much more, first you get a guarantee from the insurance company.  Second if you're not happy with the repairs then you have someone that will work with you and that body shop.  Third if you are in a rental vehicle then they have a little more control of the rental situation.  <br>  <br>  If you choose to use your own shop then they are not responsible for any shop delays, they will still send out an adjuster  to look at your vehicle, if the shop takes too long they will not extend your rental, and if you're not happy with your repairs then  you are SOL and they will not get involved with this.<br>  <br>  They owe for reasonable repairs. which would be the going rate in the area.  The only thing you should be responsible for is your deductible and if depreciation applies maybe that too.  Different states have different rules.  but that would be it.  If your shop charges $45 a labor hour and the going rate in the area is $40 then your insurance company does not owe for the difference.  Again the amount is REASONABLE|`|pZvJpuJTaa	Not in less it's written into the contractual language of your policy.  You should have a choice of where your vehicle is repaired and if it's not in your policy, I would consider this as them receiving a kickback from the body shop.  You can bet the other carrier is not going to pay for this.<br>  <br>  Read your policy in regards to collision, if it's not stated in there I would definitely contact the Dept. Of Insurance in your area and report it.  If it is, you agreed to their contract and need to abide by the rules of it.|`|8h4ol3w6aa	I know it sucks but they can. Think of it like your medical insurance...you have to go to the doctors covered under your health insurance plan.

ukN9HZ0oaa	Yes you can,and you'll get very little for it.<br>  But without insurance you're still going to have to make all the payments because it wasn't the dealerships fault that  you wrecked your car. You still owe them their money. It's your own fault for driving without insurance. <br>  What if you killed someone. Then a totaled car would be the least of your problems.|`|8GDBr2U9aa	You get to keep making the payments until the loan is paid off. Insurance doesn't seem like such a bad deal now, does it? Have you contacted the lender? They own the car, not the dealer (unless it's a buy here/pay here place).|`|S5FZy9Ppaa	I guess you could sell it without a title but you won't get much for it......|`|pZvJpuJTaa	Nope!!  Who financed the car?  If it's the dealership, your stuck.  <br>  <br>  If it's an outside finance company you need to call them.  Normally they require insurance coverage and if you don't supply it, they do.<br>  <br>  So now, because you did not have insurance coverage...your in a tight situation.  Not only do you still have to pay for the vehicle, you have towing fees, possible future storage fees (because you can't sell it without title).  All that could have been avoided.<br>  <br>  Talk about karma........good luck to you!!|`|fQBfjdz1aa	In the states that i know of you need a title to sell the vehicle to a junk yard.  If your policy lapsed and your lienholder was placed on notice of this then they would have  added insurance to protect the car and added it the note.  You need to contact your finance company not the dealership unless it's a tote the note kind of place.  <br>  <br>  call your finance company and see what they tell you.
42yyZN5laa	I don't think there is, only because there are always different types of levels. As you get more experienced there are better and bigger ones, and also with what you want the bike for. Comfort, looks, etc. <br>  I learned on the suzuki gz 250 and LOVED it. I'm possibly getting a suzuki gs 450 today. It just all depends on your comfort zone, experience, and whatnot. <br>  The kawasaki ninja 250 is a nice sports style bike. Vs. the suzuki I like is more of a cruiser. <br>  I guess it could depend on your age too. Younger girls normally like the sportier ones. I like them both(i'm 22). I'd just rather go for whatever I'm comfortable with.<br>  If you have an area by you where you can take a safety course, normally they supply bikes there for the class. Then you can test that out. <br>  For just starting, I wouldn't go any higher than a 500cc. But sit on a few bikes and see what you feel comfortable on.|`|SAgkmyqYaa	Cruiser not sport bike as sport bikes sit much higher and women are generally a little shorter than guys. As for size that has more to do with experience than it does size or sex but maybe start off with a 600 if your new. A lighter bike might be nice to have for a women too. Some of the older Suzuki Intrduers are 800's and only weigh like 440 pounds which is almost as light as a sport bike. Yamaha V-Stars are also relativly light and have a very low seat height.|`|6FpR68b1aa	I have a 1950 Panhead that's 84 cu in. that I built from the ground up.

Every one made cannot be good at everything.  <br>  What do you want to do on a motorcycle?  How will you use it?<br>  What kind of distances will you be riding?  How much do you need to carry?  <br>  Look at the persons telling you any Harley is the Perfect Woman's Bike?  Do you think this is true?  I sure don't.  Heavy machines that vibrate and have a somewhat awkward seating position.  Forward controls, so popular with many Harley riders, reduce your ability to control the machine.  Plus Harleys are generally more expensive.  If you buy one and tell us it is the greatest, more power to you.<br>  If you do not need to carry much of anything, take a look at the Kawasaki 250 R Ninja.<br>  See website below to see what a 250 R is capable of doing in the right hands.<br>  Good luck.|`|TSAl7ZX1aa	Is there such a thing as a Perfect Woman?<br>  <br>  There are horses for courses, true, there is less choice for smaller riders but there is little reason to be restricted to one bike, there are all kinds of lowering kits and smaller bikes – if that is what you need/want.|`|fl60KL8oaa	There is no such thing as a perfect bike, period.<br>  <br>  There can be a perfect bike for a particular person for use in a particular situation, but beyond that it is all compromise.<br>  <br>  First, style:<br>  <br>  Some people like sport / race replica bikes.  I find them grotesquely ugly.  Some people like the tall stance and suspension of a dirt based bike, a dual purpose, super motard, etc..  I rode a DT175 for a dozen years, a dual purpose bike is great in the city as it ignores minor things such as pot holes, curbs, stairs, etc.. I would need at least a six inch extension to my legs to ride one.  Others like the lazy laid back rocking chair ride of a cruiser.  And there are still a few who go for a more standard bike such as the TU250 or Bonneville.<br>  <br>  Second, where:<br>  <br>  If you're riding only low speed city streets, commuting to a local college, shopping, whatever, never going over 40 mph, a 50cc scooter is good.  If those local streets get upto 55 mph something in the 150-250cc range would be needed.  However, as you go up in engine size you also go up in bike weight.  For use in the city, lighter is better, more agile, so you don't want bigger than you need.<br>  <br>  If you want to run on the freeways, a 250 is about minimal, with 400cc being what I would consider the ideal.  (the baby Ninja being the exception, it runs like a 400.)<br>  <br>  For touring, running endless hours down the superslab or even two lane byways, the smaller bikes are running close to max and tend to buzz, the vibrations being very exhausting.  You want something large and heavy and smooth.  <br>  <br>  Then there is the joyriding on a weekend, carving the canyons, taking the twisties, knee dragging happiness.  That's where the sport bikes shine.<br>  <br>  But roads only cover a small part of the Earth, off-road is a lot bigger.  I've been places where I've checked my track from the previous year and noted that only two people had crossed them.<br>  <br>  When looking for a bike you first have to figure out what style you like and where and how you will be riding.  Impossible to have a motorcycle that will do everything, let alone please everyone.<br>  <br>  So, no.  No such thing as a Perfect Woman's Bike.|`|bqLvWpcZaa	There is no such thing as a perfect bike for a woman, or a man.

To actually remove scratches you'll need a polish.  SYSTEM ONE X3 polish works VERY well be hand or by a machine.

YO1w7gpiaa	My father always said to me, "A good car is more than a nice paint job, or how nice the seats feel or how loud the radio plays.  A good car is the one that will get you from Point-A to Point-B dependably".<br>  <br>  Consider how many miles/km are on the car, consider any repairs, and consider any collisions.  You will want to have the car's current condition evaluated by an auto mechanic - before you buy the car.  Today, using the car's VIN number a CAR FAX report can be brought-up to tell you/your mechanic some of these things.  Steer clear of any car that has been "salvaged" or been in a flood, as there can be many ongoing expensive repairs and problems ahead.<br>  <br>  Talk with your mechanic about how long specific engines and transmissions are good for, before requiring major repairs.  This will give you a better idea of how to make your choice.  The cost of a car is more than the purchase-price, it also includes maintenance costs to keep it running well.<br>  <br>  Oh, and one other thing Dad used to say:  "Check your oil".|`|AA10027044	MITSUBISIHI|`|ukN9HZ0oaa	Mitsubishi

This is a separate cause of action against your friend. <br>  <br>  The insurance on the car would need to list all drivers. Everyone who uses the car on a regular basis. That includes the sister who has no drivers license. Of course, no insurance company is going to insure someone who does not have a drivers license. <br>  <br>  If the car is not properly insured....i.e. your friend (boyfriend, sister) lie on the application of insurance about the use of the car, where it is garaged, who uses the car....and there is an accident....the insurance company can deny coverage.<br>  <br>  That means....your friend....as the registered owner of the vehicle....can be sued and held PERSONALLY responsible for any damage/injuries/death the driver causes. <br>  <br>  Your friend can end up eyeball deep in a pile of sh*t if anyone has a wreck driving that car.

uLEpOpSMaa	If it has a 350 engine, the power potential is only limited by your sanity and wallet.  The 350s in '69 already have very decent heads and cams in them if it's a factory 4-barrel engine.  The 2-barrel engines didn't have as much performance potential from the factory heads/cam.  If it's a stock 350 4-barrel, you should already be making an honest 280 horsepower.  <br>  <br>  If you want to make some more honest power without spending a boat load, I'd install some headers with a free flowing dual exhaust system, Flowmaster mufflers, a 600cfm Holley carburetor, Edelbrock Performer Air Gap intake manifold, a MSD ignition coil and wires, and a high flow air filter.  You should make roughly 330-340 horsepower/360 torque with that combo without touching the stock internals.  Then have some lower gears installed in the rear end (3.42's - 3.55's would be ideal for a performance street application).  <br>  <br>  Then you'll have a really fun street car with lots of usable power.  Hope that helps!  I'd recommend contacting some performance shops for some expert advice, and have them take a look at the car.|`|AA12265870	It really depends on how much money you want to spend.With the age of your car,you'll find that when you start adding HP,you need to upgrade alot of other things like exhaust,suspension,steering and most important-Brakes!

If it's a Front wheel drive, take the tire off and check everything. I had a 1996 Hyundai Elantra where the Tire nearly came off (The drive axel thingy kept it from going). Also, Chekc your brake pads. they may need changed.<br>  <br>  Check your tires too. Sometimes belts on Radials will brake and can do that.|`|ky3B42f6aa	If it happens ONLY when braking, then it is a case of Occam's razor:  i.e. the brakes.  The left is grabbing, but the right is not.  Slam them on while driving on a dirt road and see what tracks you make.|`|fjHpA5oiaa	Ball joints, wheel bearings, or bushings. Fix it very soon! Scary! Or it could be the alignment so out of whack, did you buy it used? Do you know if it had ever been wrecked before? Or CV joints.
NvCPwSGPaa	Yes, you just have to ship it over to Saudi which would be expensive you might be better off just finding one there already, or maybe closer in Europe since they are made in Germany anyways.

KuWLNfYbaa	100,000 miles is no mileage for a Merc diesel and the spec is relevant to what was ordered and paid extra for at the point of sale.If it has leather electric seats,air con,on board computer etc it is top of the range.Hope you enjoy the car.The 300 TD is a sought after car|`|Og3vKQeWaa	very nice car, but I don`t think you will make many friends by boasting about it! I myself am not bothered, due to owning a very exciting Toyota Avensis (that was of course a joke), but my advantage is one of<br>  practicality!<br>  Over the last thirty years, I have owned two Mercs and even though I admire the quality, they almost bankrupt me, with repairs etc..|`|CcXH9UHuaa	Good luck to you I have a merc too why because they are good cars|`|B1GjfOUdaa	You have that Merc look about you. Enjoy.|`|iNCzewKRaa	A 98' with only 100 miles ???????????????   Whats wrong with it ?|`|AA10810277	Why are you boasting????  Inflated ego, inflated............ typical man can't help himself.<br>  <br>  I don't own a Merc but I do own a wonderful house with a pool and a servant. No not boasting just the truth.|`|GHefTsUyaa	Good choice-what Merc. do first the rest follow.<br>  A 300D is only run in at that mileage.<br>  <br>  A Merc. is for life-there's no other car,so follow the star!
lhhgXNxRaa	Yes, there is always risk with purchasing items from overseas.<br>  1. The risk that you will not receive the item. <br>  Since the seller usually asks for a down payment or a full payment, you risk losing your money. Many people are scammed this way.<br>  2. The risk that the car you purchase is not what you expected.<br>  Purchasing goods without even looking at the actual item can be very costly. Sometimes, it could arrive in bad conditions or unusable, other times, it's not even what you ordered.<br>  So be careful!<br>  Money is tough everywhere nowadays, so many more people will try to make money illegally.<br>  <br>  There are honest sellers, but there is always crooks/cheaters among them.<br>  <br>  Shipping cost? It depends on the size, weight, and the destination.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|K8yfOHCyaa	If your thinking about buying a car from India, I'm sorry, but your probably getting screwed over. There are too many scammers out there to risk it. And, unless this vehicle is over $70,000, you can't do anything about it if you are scammed. I wouldn't do it, and I advise you to back out now.
f5ibT3WNaa	If it's just the pads then about $150. parts and labor. If you have to replace rotors then about $30 per rotor and not anything else for labor.
5fb953f56c0d23c9218db55110b835c8aa	search craigslist.org, whatever you find , it won't be pretty|`|mTwn8p79aa	Bad news. At $500, you can't afford a decent truck. It'll break down and leave you stranded with a repair that undoubtedly costs more than the truck did when you bought it.    You need to save up at least three grand to get a decent car. Anything less will just be money down the drain.|`|igYM91eRaa	Does it need to be drivable or just start?
AA12339318	The legal responsibility for the collision and the repair liability are two separate issues.    If you got a citiation for not traveling SLOW enough for the conditions, or for following too closely then that ticket will probably stand up in court.  The other driver may THINK it was all his fault, but he's not the one driving your car.|`|XLXncQu9aa	You should go to court and contest this.  Don't pay if you know you aren't at fault.  What you need to do is present your side of this in court.  Also it would help if the person you were involved in the accident confessed to the liability.  If the other driver actually admits to the court that they were at fault, then you will not have to pay the ticket but they will.  As long as you can  prove that you didn't do it, and the other driver admits to the officials they were the one at fault, then you will get off.|`|vFvI16P7aa	Nope, you were certainly NOT far enough away from the vehicle and were involved in the accident.  That ticket will not be taken away just because the other driver had "admitted 100% liability".  If you were further away from the car at the time, you probably wouldn't have hit the car in front of you.  So, the ticket stands, it's just that your own insurance won't go up because of the accident itself.|`|IV6aRyI7aa	Depends what you were ticketed for.. If what you are ticked for caused the accident then no you wont get it revoked, if you were ticked for a burn out tail light, then yes you p[rolly will|`|uh2bkRrFaa	Won't make a bit of difference. It's what the cop wrote, not the insurance. I've been through this. You got screwed and there isn't anythin you can do. Trust me on this one and don't listen to the people who are GUESSING which is the norm in here.|`|aZXnW6AUaa	it depends|`|Kmk8OlBCaa	THIS WOULD FREE YOU FROM YOUR TICKET BECAUSE THE OTHER DRIVER SAID THAT IT WAS THEIR FAULT.|`|tLxk3Q5caa	Plead not guilty to the ticket and request a trial. When on the stand explain that you were following at least 4-5 car lengths behind and hit the same patch of black ice and couldn't slow. Also, with out having an attitude or sounding arrogant remind the court that the other driver admitted liability.|`|AA11599430	i'm not sure what you might wanna do is consult an attorney and get his or her legal advise.
Yq2CUhtYaa	http://consumerguideauto.howstuffworks.c...    Average condition: $2100-$2500.    Reasonably? $2 grand.    Granted, you didn't provide any info at all about the miles, condition, etc. You know, stuff that would help figure out the value.....
