They're there to advise and if your head agrees with her I suppose you have to run with it.    Good luck.|`|jI85GYGoaa	Yes - Is the short answer.    You are employed by the L.E.A. and as in any organisation you can reasonably be expected to fulfill any legitimate request by an Officer of that organisation in a Senior position to you.Otherwise you will be deemed to be 'obstructive' at best or more likely in breach of Contract.    There is often a lot more going on in the backround.    It sounds as if this dept has 'issues' which the Senior management team do not know how to address and the Advisor is being brought in to fulfill the L.E.A. agenda in such cases.    In your heart of hearts you may disagree with the content - method and style of what you are being asked to deliver but you must on a 'Professional ' level be seen to extend all coutesies without let or hindrance.... etc.    Given the Geographical constraints you mention I believe you have answered your own question.    Best Wishes and Sincere Sympathy.

FD8I4zthaa	Ham is a saxon ending. It would be because the saxons drove them out.|`|B8j7pA6baa	Vikings liek Ham|`|fOZPJhoPaa	I can only find Anglo-Saxon towns with 'ham' which means 'a homestead' so unless the vikings settled there I don't really know you can check on the wikipedia web site it gives you all the generic English place names their origins and meanings|`|22oMednCaa	I don't think you're going to find one and here's why:    My understanding is that the "-ham" in European place names is  short for "hamlet." In Old English, a hamlet is a village without a church. And "hamlet" comes from "hamelet" ? "hamel" ? "ham," which is actually Frankish, meaning "village."  http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?sear...    Edit:  A friend now informs me that what I said above is sometimes true, but in some place-names the "ham" is OE for "in the bend of the river," (as in her grandparents' town Walthamshire). Didn't know that!

22oMednCaa	"Corrival" is a word, but it's not used that way. It can be a noun, verb, or adjective. Your sentence needs a noun. But when corrival is used as a noun, it means "a fellow rival" (not "a competition"). For example, Pepsi and RC Cola are corrivals of Coke.    Why not just use "contest"?    Or, if you want a fancier word, how about "concours"?  Note, there is no 'e' on the end! You can hear it spoken here: http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q...    Some other synonyms:  bout, encounter, event, matchup, tournament|`|6YXqIlLiaa	I don't know the word "corrival" so I am unable to comment.  however a different word for competition could be event or challenge, probably better with challenge

AA10023710	To the first poster: CUNY is no longer open admissions. I think they stopped that in the 1970's.     To the person asking the question: community colleges are all open admissions.     Are you looking for an art or communications school? I ask because you're looking at Temple and at VCU, which are great art/communications schools. If you are, then look at Academy of Art University, in California. It is open admissions. Another strong art/communications school which is actually, surprisingly not hard to get into at all, is Kent State University. Another, shockingly easy to get into considering how damn good the art school is, is the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. Lastly, look at Curry College, in Mass. It's not hard to get into, and it's good for communications.       Colleges in the region where you're looking - maybe roughly New England down through Virginia - and which are, in reality, open admissions, include: Cambridge College, CUNY Medgar Evers College, CUNY New York City College of Technology, Goddard College, Granite State College, Mercy College, Pierce College, Potomac College, Sojourner Douglas College, Southeastern U, U Maine Fort Kent, U District of Columbia, Woodbury Institute of Champlain College, Woodbury U, and Worcester State College. I have no idea of which of those might be of interest to you. I don't know much about them, other than Champlain, Mercy, U Maine and Worcester State, but all are pretty much open admissions.|`|pQ3fzgjBaa	Community colleges.    And the only open admissions 4-year university I can think of is the City University of New York (CUNY)

Other examples:  If you got 10 Bs and 10 As, you got a 3.5  If you got 2 Bs and 1 A, that's a 3.3333.  If you got a B+ that's a 3.3 and a B- is a 2.7.

yGOmMQP7aa	The Pell amounts have not changed from 08-09 to 09-10.  The max Pell grant is still $4,731 per year. Obama has made a proposal to increase the Pell for the following year (2010-2011) by 500.00 a year, making the max  $5,231 but this has yet to be approved.    Yes, if you do not use all your Pell (2,600) in the fall and spring, you can use the extra during the summer.|`|il0aaYsdaa	They haven't decided Pell Awards for this year yet because the stimulus bill hasn't passed (or failed).  20093 should be for summer session, if you don't use it then you can forfeit the aid and you should (usually) be eligible for that extra $300 for next year.
XKpM9C9Gaa	Hi  Join clubs, it may be a bit hard to start with but you will have something in common with the people there, it takes time to build relationships, seriously, in my first year of college I felt so lonely but now I have managed to make some great friends, they where all around me already but I either didn't notice their friendship or it took time to build up the relationship, I understand how you feel, you will find friends in the most unusal ways, if that makes sense.    Good Luck xxxxx|`|ZZ5Rm406aa	You have to help yourself. Just be confident that no one in this world is unimprtant more so an educated person like you. Read a lot in library.

It will take time.|`|xsS88IEpaa	make a list of things you like to do    find out about any clubs or societies that do those things    join one or more clubs / societies    find out about muslim groups and join them    if you feel really down you could even go to student services and find out about support groups or counselling - theres bound to be some people feeling like you and your uni should have some form of support for people in this situation|`|tFoSy2YRaa	Try getting a part-time job on campus - extra money and you meet new people. Also join societies - there must be a muslim society where you can meet some like-minded people.  I realise that if you won't go out to bars or pubs or clubs this minimises your chances for socialising a bit. You've just got to invite flatmates or other people out for lunch, arrange to go to lectures together and so on.  Think about your reasons for choosing the course you're on, and decide if they were good ones.|`|DGA5Rtc4aa	Does your university department have a society, e.g. biology society.  you could get involved with this, organise events, work with lecturers and other students on getting in external speakers, away weekends, etc.    good luck.|`|c2f7ef4507c724db34ebbcc925ef59e1aa	"Sometimes I feel I should just quit and become a house wife." Hey, now you're just being silly! Good on you for getting out there and doing something with your life. You shouldn't give that up because of one bad experience.    I understand how lonely and isolating university can be- I'm in my second year and often feel that way. But there's also a lot of good stuff if you just go looking for it, and it doesn't have to involve clubbing or drinking. I'd rather watch films with friends than get drunk any day!    You really need to get to the Union and check out classes that are held in the evenings- there's generally a good selection to cater to different tastes, and you could try something new too. I do life drawing and Lishi (a bit like tai chi) and meet loads of great people. Many people are like you and not only go to pursue a hobby but to meet new folks.    If all else fails, you could maybe see about moving to a different university, or a different course if it suits. Be aware that Halls and First Year are not all fun and games like people make out, and are often a mine-field of people who you're just thrown in with. It takes time to find people who you get on with. I'm still in the process of making friends- and in second year you meet a new crowd (I don't hang about with anyone I knew in first year).    These things take time and the university has facilities to help. You have options, remember today was just a bad day, but you'll have good ones to come!|`|00ieFmYbaa	it can be difficult if you dont do certain things cos lots of young people have it.     but deffo join clubs & societies...i was shy to go to one at first, now ive made many friends who have the same personality as me!!!|`|45deb346668a7b66aee588c0399444f9aa	Did you have any hobbies before you went to uni?

Ask for Pizotifen, they work a treat :)|`|kj507W26aa	I also suffered migraines from age 19-27.  Talk to your teachers and ask them what can be done on your part to make up for the days you are absent.  If it means, going to school on weekends and night school, so be it, right!  You want to graduate, right! Whatever it takes.  Also here are a few things to try avoiding  Causes  The symptoms of migraines occur as a result of changes in the diameter of blood vessels to the brain and surrounding structures.  include the following:     Alcohol   Low blood sugar from, for example, missing meals   Certain foods such as those containing the amino acid tyramine (found in red wine, aged cheese, smoked fish, chicken livers, figs, and some beans), chocolate, nuts, peanut butter,   some fruits (like avocado, banana, and citrus),   foods with monosodium glutamate (MSG  an additive in many foods), Ask the chinese waitress to avoid putting this in your order.   onions, dairy products, meats containing nitrates (bacon, hot dogs, salami, cured meats) fermented or pickled foods   Fluctuations in hormones (for example, menstruation)   Certain odors, such as perfume   Allergic reaction   Bright lights   Loud noises   Stress, physical or emotional (often, the headache occurs during the period of relaxation just following a particularly stressful time)   Sleeping too little or too much   Caffeine (Coffee, cola's, tea, chocolate candy & choc.milk)  Smoking or exposure to tobacco smoke   Prolonged muscle tension (for example, from a tension headache can lead to a mixed migraine-tension headache)     Hope this was helpful.   It helped mine alot and I no longer get migraine headaches. Its been 10 yrs.|`|oKjcTZypaa	Your doctor can give you a note to explain your absence. I would also recommend asking the doctor to prescribe Epidrin or Midrin for you to have on hand while at school so you can take it right away if you notice a migraine coming on, which might help you save more sick days (check out http://www.MIDRIN.org for more info..)    Good Luck & Feel better, I'm sure you'll graduate fine.
lU8e0VQFaa	Not usually, you would have to have a reason better than 'I like it more' when you go to sign up for school you have to prove you live in that district, which means a parent would need to bring something with their name on it and the address (like a lease or utility bill) the reason being that the school receives money from the taxes of people that live there. So if you go to a school that is outside your district then they aren't getting any tax money to cover your education.|`|br1OcbKYaa	no its not that easy -- lying to them about your addresss.    it is possible though. my friend did it. talk to your school board. although it is hard to make exeptions to the rule so you need a better reason then i want to.

As a grad student I could apply for residency, but not as an undergrad.  Maybe if you got an apartment, lived there year-round, and payed all the state taxes you could get it, but not living in the dorms.
eu6UQElYaa	Tell your parents that the teacher is talking about how women shouldn't be leaders of countries, etc.  That should be enough to get their attention and if your friends tell that to their parents likely complaints will be filed (if this is true of course, don't lie about it just because you don't like the teacher).   Discrimination like that from a teacher is a serious offense and would be enough to get him in a load of trouble if not fired.   That way you don't have to mention anything about him looking down your shirt or staring at your butt (which you couldn't prove anyways) and you can save yourself the embarrassment while still dealing with a  less than stellar teacher.|`|MM71EOH6aa	You shouldn't really be wearing these types of shirts that you are able to look down or see through anyways, you're both wrong on both your parts.

You should also urge your friends (who also seem to be uncomfortable about it) to speak to the guidance counselor as well. If your school doesn't have one, go see the principal or a teacher you feel really comfortable around. The guidance counselor or teacher will definitely bring your concern to the principal even if you don't speak to him/her directly. I would also recommend telling your parents (maybe just speak to your mom if your uncomfortable). This is really serious and someone should be notified of it. A teacher should not be behaving this way!
5bcb488cf5f4e787272a8bff92c959b5aa	No, guidance counselors love it when students know early on what they want to do. I've had friends go to counselors as early as 9th grade to discuss career plans and future classes. S(he) should be able to provide those things for you.
lU8e0VQFaa	A GED is pretty much the same thing, you can't get a high school diploma if you already have a GED. If you did, you would have to go back and finish any missed schooling and meet the requirements to graduate, i.e. if you dropped out in the 10th grade you would need to finsh that year and 11th and 12th and maintian a good GPA and take all nessary classes, just as if you were doing it the first time through.|`|5amx0Z0aaa	A GED and a high school diploma are not the same thing. According to a 2006 study done by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, high school graduates earn about $10,000 more per year than GED holders or dropouts. The reason being is that completing high school shows that you are dependable, and a hard worker.     If you need a high school diploma, but are not of high school age, you can always get one from an online high school. Here is a website that lists a whole bunch of them- http://www.bestonlinehighschools.com. Just make sure that the one you choose is regionally accredited. I found one called The American Academy that looks really good. So here is their website, just in case you wanted it- http://www.theamericanacademy.com.     I hope this helps! Good luck earning your diploma, no matter what you decide to do!

pISC6pphaa	The whole idea of AP classes is not to be "easy".  They are meant to get you ready for college (and in some colleges will give you credit - not a bad idea, as it lowers the amount of time, and tuition you have to spend).  There will be a lot of writing, a lot of discussion, a lot of independent work and out of class assignments.  It is tough.  If you want "easy", then don't go for AP.  What you should try to get out of AP courses (and college) is an overall better idea of what college will be like, and to get a better, deeper understanding of the subjects you're taking.   I had AP History for two years, an AP history seminar class, and AP English.  Although I wasn't able to use my AP credits for college (and I didn't go to college beyond the first semester), that was the best choice I ever made.  In all those classes, there was a big emphasis on essay writing and critical thinking.  They have helped me in every area of my life, and they still help me now.    Another point: If you plan to do something massive in college, like law, medicine, etc.  It would be GREAT to do some AP stuff now.  The courses for those careers take years to get through, and getting some elementary stuff done now will save you lots of time (and money too).  It really bites that they make you decide all these things in high school (often before freshman year), because you're not really ready then to make that leap.  Think ahead, and decide where you want to be in 10 years.  And decide from that if AP is important for you.|`|mc1WX78Caa	if you take anything AP i suggest and english class. DO NOT take any AP history/geo classes for those are the hardest(even if you are good at history/geo) also, some high schools provide an AP art class, which is very exciting if you are into art class.   but honestly, being a freshman, if i were you i would do what alot of freshman do. just take 2 honors classes, and sophmore year take AP classes. you will over work your self the first year of highschool. its already a huge transition in general.|`|aaa3523f0b9d11f8a74170b04af40919aa	I took AP History, Spanish, French and Government/Economic they weren't easy but, those were classes that i personally enjoyed.

XxMhbMa3aa	OK so first i work with that smaller one since that's what you're going to substitute with. You move all the variables that you're not trying to find on one side. Let's find x since it's all alone. You subtract 2y from each side leaving x=15-2y. OK so now that you can substitute, do it. since x=15-2y, you can substitute x in the big equation with 15-2y, so 0.3(15-2y)-0.2=0.5  You can start with distributive property which means that you multiply everything inside the parenthesis by what's on the outside 0.3 times 15 and 0.3 times 2y. that's 4.5 and 0.6y, respectively. so now we can write this 4.5+0.6y-0.2y=0.5 now combine all like terms with y so 0.6y +0.2y=0.8y which leave 4.5+0.8y=0.5  So now you do the same thing as moving all the variables to one side by subtracting 4.5 from each side which leaves 0.8y=0.5-4.5 and simplified is -4 so 0.8y=-4  OK so now you simplify further and finally by dividing both sides by 0.8 and that leaves y=-5 and there's your y.    Now here's the easy part. now that you have y you can replace it so 0.3x-0.2(-5)=0.5 and do the math. 0.2 times -5 is 1 so 0.3x-1=0.5 now move everything. -(-1) that leaves 0.3x=0.5+1 and 0.5 +1 is 1.5 so 0.3x=1.5 and divide by 0.3  x=5      So X=5, and Y=-5    Thank you, thank you lol Good luck!|`|K9IqkOrEaa	lol calculator!!!!!!!|`|ALvp7YRuaa	dont know...|`|yko1tx4jaa	substitution:  from x+2y=15, subtract 2y.  then plug x=-2y+15 into the first equation.  then solve.

bOTCVCOHaa	Am I correct in assuming that women today are greedy gold diggers?  I was in a seven month relationship with a girl two years ago.

oLI2SJ08aa	I got into GW last year. I had a 3.3-ish unweighted GPA, 4.0-ish weighted. I took one AP class, but 4 AP exams. I was part of a magnet program, so I had a lot of science, math and computer sciences classes on my transcript. I also had a 2030 SAT score and 202 PSAT. I also did a research project the summer after my junior year and was involved in a bunch of extra curriculars (piano lessons, web design club, volunteering, etc).    I didn't go to GW because it was very expensive, didn't really have my major and I didn't like the campus. It is a very open campus since it's in the middle of DC. Instead of grass, there are the streets of DC. If you didn't know where GW was, you could easily just think it's a set of buildings. GW is one of the most expensive schools in this country. Even with financial aid, it was still too much for me. (that and I got a very nice scholarship from the school I currently attend) GW didn't have the major I wanted either. It was offered as a concentration of a computer science major, which isn't what I wanted.    Frankly, I think GW costs too much for what it offers. If you're in the state of Maryland, the state schools are pretty good and much cheaper. Well, College Park and Baltimore County are good. I can't say much for Eastern Shore. Consider them instead of GW.|`|vaczcH2waa	i did :P:P                                                nah not really.. im from the uk lmao|`|o0GQUIXlaa	my sister got accepted to it  shes now a sophmore and she got really good grades in high school.  they also  look at any outside activiaties, maybe sports if you want but if your in any schoo clubs stuff like that    she had a 3.8 and got into George Washington  hope it helps|`|Sl2CZoEHaa	No sorry, I went to Cambridge

0592f95932446b6d9b332e719d207639aa	There are several places you can find a good tutor. First, I would decide what kind of tutoring you want. Do you want to go to a tutoring center? Do you want a one-on-one tutor to come to you? Do you want an online tutor who communicates via phone, skype, and possibly an electronic blackboard? All of these have their pros and cons, and one-on-one tutoring in person is the most expensive (and can be the most affective) while online tutoring tends to be the least expensive.    Start your search with your school to see if they have a list of tutors. It sounds like you are taking a college course, so check with the career center or with someone in the math department (you can start with your teacher.)     If you are in high school, then check with your teacher and the guidance department. If you run across a tutor that specializes in something other than math, then call anyway and ask him or her if he/she knows of a good math tutor. Tutors tend to talk to each other, and can often refer you to someone who is just what you need.    If that doesn't work, then I would go to Craig's List and see if there is a tutor advertising there. Also, you can do a Google or Yahoo search for "math tutor (your town)" or "algebra tutor (your town)" and you will get a bunch of results.    Make sure you check the tutor's references, ask about experience and whether you have to sign a long term contract. Also, ask the tutor how he/she handles cases where it doesn't go well (i.e. you want to stop tutoring, are their penalties? Do you get money back?)|`|TW4MHCybaa	Aren't i a good enough tutor for you?

I live in Indiana, and I am in a "Transition To Teaching" program which allows me to take master's level college courses that will lead to me being able to get my state teacher's license. I was reading about a state in New England however, where persons with Bachelor's Degrees signed up, put together a portfolio, did some student teaching, and that was all to get their licensure. Go to your state's Department of Education website and look for Alternative Licensure links, or something similar. You could also look at programs offered by nearby colleges.     Good luck!|`|G4octcMsaa	Maybe if ur teachng a business administration class..|`|c52e399d1b587b1acb45e41a8672197caa	I agree with the previous answer, if you're gonna teach business then most likely yes at a college or something but as a normal school teacher you'd have to take the necessary pedagogic classes.

zpXTgUpiaa	To do a and b you have to make an equation in the format of y=mx+b y would equal your total, m equals the number in front of x (in this case it would be negative two) and b stands for the y-intercept. (16 for this) so your equation would be y=-2x+16. so to get the x-intercept, you would make y=0, so your equation would like 0=-2x+16, and the answer would be 8 (0=-2*8+16, 0=-16=16, 0=0) So you were right on 1a and 1b  To solve 2a+2b you do the same thing. y=-10x+500. 500 would be your y-intercept, and know we make y=0, so (0=-10x+500,              0=-10*50+500, 0=-500+500, 0=0) So your x-intercept would be 50.

Perhaps start it with "The essay A Wrinkle In Time (in italics) is about ..."    Also, the second sentence is ambiguous. How does *what* affect people? The essay, or the love and lack of love?

Bar cookies are created when a batter or soft dough is spooned into a shallow pan, then baked, cooled and cut into bars. Hand-formed (or molded) cookies are made by shaping dough by hand into small balls, logs, crescents and other shapes. Pressed cookies are formed by pressing dough through a cookie press (or pastry bag) to form fancy shapes and designs. Refrigerator (or icebox) cookies are made by shaping the dough into a log, which is refrigerated until firm, then sliced and baked. Rolled cookies begin by using a rolling pin to roll the dough out flat; then it is cut into decorative shapes with cookie cutters or a pointed knife. Other cookies, such as the German springerle, are formed by imprinting designs on the dough, either by rolling a special decoratively carved rolling pin over it or by pressing the dough into a carved cookie mold. In England, cookies are called biscuits, in Spain they're galletas, Germans call them keks, in Italy they're biscotti and so on.    Drop cookies are made from a relatively soft dough that is dropped by spoonfuls onto the baking sheet. During baking, the mounds of dough spread and flatten. Chocolate chip cookies (Toll House cookies), peanut butter cookies, and oatmeal (or oatmeal raisin) cookies are popular examples of drop cookies.   Refrigerator cookies are made from a stiff dough that is refrigerated to become even stiffer. The dough is typically shaped into cylinders which are sliced into round cookies before baking.   Molded cookies are also made from a stiffer dough that is molded into balls or cookie shapes by hand before baking. Snickerdoodles are an example of molded cookies.   Rolled cookies are made from a stiffer dough that is rolled out and cut into shapes with a cookie cutter. Gingerbread men are an example.   Pressed cookies are made from a soft dough that is extruded from a cookie press into various decorative shapes before baking. Spritzgeb?ck are an example of a pressed cookie.   Bar cookies consist of batter, cheese, or other ingredients that are poured or pressed into a pan (sometimes in multiple layers), and cut into cookie-sized pieces after baking. Brownies are an example of a batter-type bar cookie, while Rice Krispie treats are a bar cookie that doesn't require baking, perhaps similar to a cereal bar. In British English, bar cookies are known as "tray bakes".   Sandwich cookies are rolled or pressed cookies that are assembled as a sandwich with a sweet filling. Fillings may be with marshmallow, jam, or icing. The Oreo cookie, made of two chocolate cookies with a vanilla icing filling is an example.   Fried cookies including traditional cookies such as the krusczyki, rosettes and fattigmann as well as a newer American trend of deep-frying ordinary drop cookie dough.

if7FX3OTaa	Here is the correct version -     This quote said by Gandhi is meant to be interpreted that if we respond to any sort of violence, the other will respond with equivalent or more violence. The quote "An Eye for an Eye and a Tooth for a Tooth" is a prime example of this!  When this sort of revenge occurs, everyone will continue to hurt one another until we are all wounded. If the world goes on like this everyone will be blind because almost everyone seeks revenge when they are harmed, in order to not feel inferior to others. Yet this is how our world works! If someone bombs a country, it is only right to bomb them back. If a religion kills some of your people, you kill some of theirs back. It is also present in smaller situations; he punches her, and she punches him back. This leaves us all blind because people are consumed with hatred and revenge for those who have done them wrong. Feeling this hatred people become blind, and not able to see that there are other ways out of the situation like to forgive. Not seeing this, people are left in a continuous circle of revenge and hate not being able to see a way out, no body wins and everybody continues to lose. This quote is similar to Two wrongs dont make a right. I am interested with this quote because it is an interesting double layer play on words. No one can see when everyone takes an eye for every eye they lose.    Although I do not go to Church every often my sisters and I use to sit down and read parts of the bible out loud together before we went to bed. When reading the quote An Eye for an Eye makes the whole World blind it stirred a memory of my sister once explaining a story in the Bible that was quite similar. In the Bible it is stating how if a neighbour blinds another neighbour, the family has the right to blind them back, because revenge is said to set them back as equals.

"This quote said by Gandhi is meant to be interpreted that if we respond to any sort of violence the other will respond with equivalent or more violence." Respond should be resort. Only the first one though. "and hate not being able to see a way out, no body wins and everybody continues to lose." no body is one word. It should be "nobody." "every often my sisters and I use to sit down and read parts of the bible" the word 'use" should be "used".     Other than that I believe you can turn it in to your teacher or whomever.|`|e2f3ba1150fe97777acdf4c1d1d1fc3faa	I also corrected some of the grammar.      This quote said by Gandhi is meant to be interpreted that if we respond to any sort of violence the other will respond with equivalent or more violence. You take his eye, he takes your eye; she takes my tooth I take her tooth, etc. When this sort of revenge happens everyone continues to wound each other till we are all wounded.

AA10176626	Josh:    The answer to this question depends on what type of loan you are applying for. If you are applying for a Stafford Loan, through the government's Federal Student Aid program, the lender will not consider any of your financial circumstances in making the loan. Your income is irrelevant, your credit history (good, bad, or non-existent) is irrelevant, and you will never be asked to provide a cosigner on the loan. That's why the Stafford lending program is so great.    If you're wondering how that can be - it's very simple. The lenders don't care about your finances, because the federal government has promised to guarantee your loan. If you can't pay the lender, the government will. No risk - no worries.    If you're applying for one of the very, very rare "private" or "alternative" loans that are still being made right now, then the lender will apply a conservative, traditional lending analysis to your loan. They will evaluate your income and your assets, and they will look at your credit history, in order to determine whether you have a good record of repaying your debts. If you're like most young people, and you have little or no credit history, it is very unlikely that a lender is going to trust you with ten or fifteen thousand dollars of their money. Like most student borrowers, the chances are good that the lender will insist that you provide a cosigner, before they'll approve your loan.    A few comments about "how much you qualify for":    The Stafford loan program has an annual limit. Dependent students can borrow up to $5500 as freshmen, $6500 as sophomores and $7500 as juniors and seniors.    Alternative loan eligibility is also capped, but in another way. Your maximum borrowing ability is limited to the amount of your Cost of Attendance that is not covered by any other forms of aid or cash that your school expects to receive on your behalf. Cost of Attendance, a financial aid term, includes tuition, fees, books, room and board, and other miscellaneous education-related expenses. If you look around the financial aid page of your school's website, you will find their published Cost of Attendance figures.    I hope that information helped. By the way, the lender will not be particularly interested in your mom and dad's financial circumstances - they're not the borrowers, and unless they cosign the loan, the lender will not be able to turn to your parents for repayment. The bank doesn't care if your dad is Bill Gates, because he's not going to be the one that they're going to have to try to get their money from when the loan becomes due.    Good luck!|`|il0aaYsdaa	It's a factor, but not a big one.  Basically they want to know what your ability to re-pay is.  If you're still a dependent your parent's annual pay is what is going to determine how much aid you get anyway.  If you're not a dependent it could be a bigger factor because it's considered a liquid asset.
AA10251481	From my experience, post-secondary refers to any education received after high school graduation.

a343e583f03dab83be6088676d7d0ee7aa	The English language can be tricky when trying to discern some of the syntactical rules. The word "some" is used as an adverb here to signify an unknown amount, thus modifying the noun "people." My belief is that this preposition has an substantival relation to the sentence. I am not an English teacher, but that is my best reasoning of the sentence.|`|O8qdCBzLaa	I think it modifies "running a marathon". I'm trying to think about how this sentence would be diagrammed. But, I am 46 and it's been a while since I did that.    Anyway, if you get rid of "for some people", you get the sentence "Running a marathon is a difficult task." And, you get basically the same sentence putting the phrase at the beginning ("For some people, running a marathon is a difficult task."). It actually seems like the phrase "for some people" modifies the whole sentence. So, I'll assign it to the subject of the sentence, "Running a marathon".

You may be better suited to learning in an online class setting.  Something else to take into account is who is accrediting the classes.

I had to teach myself everything (I took physics) and it was a lot harder.

EnJPfipTaa	Yes, you need to major in a life/natural science (biology, chem, etc).      The reason behind this is because the term forensic just means a subject that has legal context.  You're a scientist who testifies in court, basically.  Most employers will verse you on how to testify/serve as an expert witness, so a law background is not necessary but some knowledge helps.  I would major in chemistry --- that's the best choice if you intend on working in a crime lab and supplement you elective courses with some criminal law and criminal justice courses, it will help you out in the long run.     Good luck.|`|SMs0MoTvaa	Yes, but you need to take more classes than just that.|`|z7aUPU0Raa	It depends on what you interest is within forensics, where you're looking to attend school, and what your goals are.

It never hurts to start in the biological sciences if you're interested in an eventual career in forensics, but once you're at the university find someone who does research in something you're interested in and make an appointment to sit down and talk.|`|XxGB4eGyaa	lot's of chemistry  and probably a few criminal justice and law classes

That's because they never found anything and is not considered a valid field of science - it's not taught beyond one courses at the most at colleges, and even that one is about how it doesn't work.      A psychologist has a PhD or PsyD, which is 8-12 years of college (PhD programs don't have a set length; you're done when you're done).  Theology isn't all that useful unless you want to teach it, but count on again 8-12 years for a PhD, as well as Egyptology (offered in few places but an actual field of science this time).|`|XxGB4eGyaa	i know that to major in psychology or theology  you need to go for at least for years  because that's what i want to do  but the other one's are probably 4 years also|`|6EynJobZaa	Bachelor's degrees in all four? some double majors can complete two degrees in four years (summer and winter break terms most likely included.

Wn4tjazIaa	Shortening summer vacation puts more stress on teachers. They're the ones who have to come up with lesson plans, grade homework, and basically deal with 20+ kids every single day for most of the year. Not only that, but having kids home in the summer can cause struggle for full time parents if they have kids who aren't able to stay at home by themselves for long periods of time. If schools are open during the hotter parts of the year, they need to pay extra for air conditioning to make rooms at lease semi-comfortable. And, to be fair to kids, they do need time to play and relax from the stress of the year.|`|hLBEXVyXaa	well if we didn't have as much of a break, we'd ALL GET BORED! lols nobody would want to work because it's all we do, we would never get time off. and when summer's in and during school, if you go to a school with dress codes, well teacher better look out cuz many many people (most likely girls) would break those rules. and it needs to be long enough because sports and activities, family events, traveling, we'd just miss more school because there'd be not enough time to do anything during break if it were shorter    hope this helps i had to do the same thing i used most of these and i gotta A so good luck!|`|Ov83HJEFaa	A longer school year...ew

AA11039109	For small molecules, you can usually deduce the structure by the chemical reactions to which it is subject, and you can see the results of those.      For huge molecules like DNA, X-ray diffraction shows the structure.  It's not easy.  Watson and Crick got the Nobel prize for deducing the structure of DNA.    No, they're not guessing and they have every idea.  There'd be no field of Chemistry if molecular structure weren't understood.  Study more.

ZSJZzC7Iaa	TO A T - "We use this expression very commonly in the sense of minute exactness, perfection; as, the coat fits to a T; the meat was done to a T. It is easy to dismiss the origin of the expression as, I am sorry to say, some of our leading dictionaries do, by attributing it to the draftsman's T-square, which is supposed to be an exact instrument, but the evidence indicates that the expression was in common English use before the T-square got its name. 'To a T' dates back to the seventeenth century in literary use and was undoubtedly common in everyday speech long before any writer dared to or thought to use it in print. But it is likely that the name of the instrument, 'T-square,' would have been in print shortly after its invention, yet the first mention is in the eighteenth century. The sense of the expression corresponds, however, with the older one, 'to a tittle,' which appeared almost a century earlier, and meant 'to a dot,' as in 'jot or tittle.' Beaumont used it in 1607, and it is probably that colloquial use long preceded his employment of the phrase..."

They created huge success after releasing their hit single "Lady (Hear Me Tonight)".    Biography  Romain Tranchart (born in Paris) first moved with his family to Mexico and Algeria, to finally live in Brazil. This is where he started learning the guitar, finding inspiration through jazz classics. He was also exposed to Bossa Nova but chose another direction, playing in a rock band called Seven Tracks once back in Paris. After a few gigs in Parisian clubs La Loco and Le Grand Rex, the band split.    At that time, he became a fan of house music, influenced by DJ Sneak, Ian Pooley and Daft Punk. He released his first house single as Funk Legacy titled "What You're Gonna Do Baby" on Vertigo Records in 1998. Later, he decided to enter the American School of Modern Music in Paris, the french division of the Berkeley's Institute of Music.    Also Parisian, Yann learned to play flute and clarinet when he was a small child. As he aged he became deeply influenced by The Beatles, The Beach Boys, David Bowie and many other pop acts. He started to play drums by emulating them. He also learned to play the piano and the guitar. He later bought himself a four track recording machine and started songwriting and singing. Fascinated more by voices than by charismatic band leaders, he liked bands such as Aerosmith, The Police and Queen and lately became a great fan of R'n'B divas.    After being a drummer and sometimes-vocalist in a few bands, he met Romain in 1998, and the partnership was born. The two quickly began recording, and from those sessions came "Lady (Hear Me Tonight)".    The single got recognition later on in 2000. It's a "French-flavour" house track with heavy pop and disco influences, which featured a sample from CHIC's "Soup For One". The track became an instant number-one across Europe, and was followed up by other singles "Chillin'", "What I Mean" and "No More Tears". With this last single, they started calling themselves Modjo Band.    After "No More Tears", they started their respective solo careers, with Romain Tranchart remixing songs from various artist like Res ("Golden Boys"), Shaggy ("Sexy Lady"), Mylne Farmer ("California") and post producing the likes of Everynote's "Once Upon a Time." Yann Destal's released a very Queen-esque album, titled The Great Blue Scar, reaching some success in France.|`|98290704c24fd02cca24498a78259fadaa	"Mojo" can refer to anything from luck to sex appeal (like in the Austin Powers movies).

f984cf994133f16bc09990d0e6cc608caa	honestly i think that we should not have guns here because it causes to many things bad to happen like threading or worse death i think that they should only be allowed in the army or military things that are like that but when they retire or something like that form the army i  think that they should make them leave with out here guns or weapons|`|4eb4bbc22d557b5753e96d6b99457258aa	Absolutely , Guns are a great advantage for humans compared to other mammals' tool use skills.  without them we would waste lots energy and men to battle.  When people invent something it is always for the better and never for the worse of the situation. If you have an opposition to my statment please imagine how life would be without it.   Example 1: a bear is on a rampage in a zoo and finds YOUR smal child in its path of territory. you are smart but physically puny creature compared to the bear. You yell, shout, scream, and growl at the enemy. Nothing happens and the bear ignores you to consume the child, there you're looking at the child being gobbled up by the physically superior animal. --- Moral = Guns are a good thing because you would've TRANQULIZED it and not kill it.  Example 2: You see a hoarde of men with chainsaws, knives, and explosives trying to commit burgarly in a bank. You see thr police approaching them with bows, sling shots and tazers. The officers took range and shot the projectiles at the men. The only thing the police accomplished was to anger the mob. Hours later they scramble with the money into the chaotic town.---Moral: Guns are extreemly great projectiles that can apply injury or death if a subject or subjects are not contained in an orderly manner.(Firearms have non-leathal and leathal forces to help society overcome chaos and the spread of it.)

You get supplements - workbooks, lab materials, etc.    You study at your own time, your own pace.     My sister is a K12 student.     I'm a Keystone National High School student. It's also online, but they give you textbooks and workbooks.
dQmFoRRiaa	Aporia  by Peter Benoit    If I could with a word well-chosen tell  You of the mysteries I've come to know  In sweet-sad murmurs of the vesper bell,  My throttled tongue would then so overflow  With tales of timeless, soft, supernal glow  That visions, gray and mundane, all have seen  (That mark and mock our outer life below)  Would be repealed, as if a stubborn screen  Had been dissolved; and all that lies between   The parclose paling of the piece-bright world  And what is masked  the pure and ever green   Would then pour forth, as through a thin wall thurled.  The truth I've glimpsed, and yet no words are found,  And so by failing silence I am bound.    This silence that's become my sole estate  Has come of late to blur what's real and dreamed;  I have been set adrift to navigate  On seas that are, and are not, what they seemed.  For I have seen the center still that's teemed   Beneath the veil that not one soul denies,  And by its sight am both damned and redeemed  In ways I could not hope to analyze,  But which have in a strange way made me wise,  Though by their awful loneliness I'm swept   Their wisdom seems all language to despise;  So often in my longing have I wept.   These are the poles that I am drawn between,  And yet how could you know quite what I mean?    While walking once along a country lane  I spied a bucket, weatherworn and bare,  Which time and circumstance half-filled with rain.  And on its waters I became aware  Of a lone beetle's silent voyage there,  And in it, mirrored, life's experience;  And now I see such visions everywhere   I've not dared glimpse the oaken bucket since.  I'm tortured and yet blessed by Providence;  It's come to shake my wakefulness with sights  That pierce me utterly and make no sense.  And what were once my pleasures and delights,  And were for my whole life the goal and sum,  Now exile me to lands where words can't come.    A golden sunset makes my words quite fail,  A crippled child and country road, the same;  In all I sense the same soul-making vale  And know its grandeur full, yet not its name.  And not once did I beckon it, it came  And poisoned me 'til I could speak no more.  Daylight's dull web and I are one and same   The empty mask that hangs beside the door.  Have I been made the sole inheritor  Of things I know, but never can explain?   Mere circumstance has scourged me to the core;  With folded hands I slowly go insane.  I've seen God's greatness, but it has been planned  That I not speak of what I understand.|`|kpzwKVDjaa	Not sure that it's a poem but:  She sells sea shells on the sea shore,  The shells she sells are sea shells I'm sure...|`|UyYvkmlPaa	i like eggs i love eggs eggs eggs eggs eggs!!!!!!!!
6000349dbd0a8f8b344256f6899b5461aa	Yes, I am a full-time online student at Keystone National High School because I travel a lot. After pulling us out of boarding school, my mom wanted an American curriculum.     Like regular high school students in US, I choose my own courses and they follow the US curriculum. They offer AP classes and honors classes.     You also have the added benefit of studying at your own time and your own pace. My teachers are awesome and really helpful. They always reply to my email within 24 hours.     My sister is with K12 International Academy, it's the the same as Keystone. The courses are online.    It is difficult. You have to discipline yourself and motivate yourself. I travel by myself or sometimes with my sister, so there's really nobody to monitor our progress or the work we've been doing everyday. It's quite hard when I'd rather be exploring a city or seeing a show at night.|`|ZSdLmfMCaa	I'm pretty sure there are people outside the country, a teacher, who would be assigned to you. You might have to pay to be home schooled outside the country but I'm not quite sure on that one. It takes a lot of motivation and it's also a lot of reading. I think it's definitely a good option to look into

tCsFxh5Aaa	Geometry is the branch of mathematics that studies shapes and figures.  In seventh grade, geometry is usually a part of the math curriculum and deals with things like finding the perimeter or area of rectangles, squares, triangles, circles, and other shapes.  It may deal with other basic geometry ideas such as lines, rays, and points; parallel lines; perpendicular lines; volume of three-dimensional shapes; and more.    Lots of websites deal with geometry, just spell it correctly and a search will find tons of information.    Hope this helps|`|Gxei2nJyaa	Maybe if you spell geometry correctly and pay attention, you would understand. Its fairly simple.
TWKIuTEyaa	I'm afraid that it will be useful for very little, other than to provide further back-up for your academic ability (if you were to successfully complete the course).    If you do not complete your NQT year within 5 years your PGCE will not even qualify you to teach.    There are no 'special needs advisors' as such in the UK (other than those employed by local authorities,  who will in the main be qualified teachers, and those employed by charities who will also, in the main, have teaching backgrounds), nor is it likely you would gain employment as an assistant Head/principal without teaching qualifications and experience.    Those posts which might be interested in your PGCE (i.e. working in local authority education departments etc) will be less impressed if you have no subsequent teaching experience. You might, however, consider further training as an Educational Psychologist, a career which (entirely wrongly, imo) no longer requires teaching experience.    Sorry if this sounds harsh, but the PGCE is a very job-specific qualification.     If you already feel like this by the middle of your first placement then I would agree that teaching does not seem to be the best idea for you. Now you must decide whether to continue (and it will get harder, and you may fail) or leave the course and cut your losses.|`|4pqL4QFLaa	f|`|7deb425958c53615415ce326bcbf08e0aa	It's a teaching qualification so there is not much else you can do with it. it might give you some credits towards a masters but that is it.|`|sX86etcsaa	You could be a tutor, special needs advisor, or go to a higher education like assistant principle.

Tell them first, let them deal with it. then they will cool down, show it to them and explain that you did your best and you know that this is bad you will study more and get Extra credit from the teacher. and hopefully, get good grades on your tests.

(While your dad's favorite football team is loosing an important playoff games is NOT a good time, and neither is while your mother's trying to feed the baby peas.) Second, you need to stay calm and say something like "Mom, Dad... I don't really know how to say this but... I'm really struggling in [insert subject here]." Then show them your report card or progress report. Then tell them that you'd like their advice on how to bring it up. They might still get angry and punish you, but if you show that you care then they'll appreciate that.

There is no harm in taking the SAT a second or even a third time./    Good luck.|`|agN864Vdaa	Okay... first off, is it a 1340/1600 or a 1340/2400?    Second, clean up your grammar. If it's the version with the written portion, that is hurting you.    Third, have you taken it once or twice? You say one, then mention taking it a third time.    Fourth- read, read, read. Look up the words you don't know, and read.    Edited to add...    With numbers like that, there's something missing in either how you take the test or how you prepare. A tutor may be invaluable.    Taking it a third time doesn't look good, but if you got help to improve your score, that does look good.

Dkk5HwbEaa	Flash cards for the meanings.  Have a friend help you.    As far as conjugating the verbs, it helps to remember the rule for IR, ER verbs etc.  Although there are always exceptions to the verb rules, there are usually consistencies that go along with the exceptions.  The best way, I think is, flash cards.  Having someone else quiz you and flash the cards is very helpful.
obmWf0pJaa	this is a tough one to answer because we really don't know the personality of the friend or the complexion of the group.     broadly, i would say it depends on the personality of the friend more than anything. if the person is a relatively outgoing person, it really doesn't matter how you do it. any way that properly introduces the friend is a good way. if the person is not outgoing, maybe introducing the friend to individuals one at a time would be a better approach.     the above paragraph assumes that you have a work or more structured environment. if this is not the case, try to make it an activity or something that gets people talking naturally. going out for a night of drinks, bowling, sports, dinner and a movie, walk around the mall. anything to get mouths moving without the weirdness of 'how are yous' and 'what do you like to dos.'

iIsfZoMuaa	First start by telling her that her behavior is inappropriate and that you are not going to tolerate it.  It is harassment and if it continues you will be forced to take action against her.  If it continues start documenting everything she does to you.  Keep a separate Notebook and write down the time, date, and location of the event.  Then take it to the principal.  Make a note of what you say to her in your initial complaint to her about the inappropriate comments.  Just make sure you keep your cool and take the journal to your principal.  Tell him that is inappropriate for her to treat any of the students this way and it is harassment.  It should be a policy in all schools not for zero tolerance for bullying and such.  This should go for teachers as well.  Tell your principal that you want a conference with him, your parents (be sure to tell your parents whats going on and show them the journal) and with the teacher.  This should then put a hault to it.  If it does not continue to keep the journal of documenting everything.

Hy0tRECMaa	The answer is it's up to you.    I work full time and took online classes for the past 5 years, as well as classes that meet on campus.  I limited myself to 3 credit hours (typically 1 class) per semester (hence, the reason why it's been 5 years) and thought I handled it very well.    Recently, I decided to pick up the pace and take 6 credit hours.  The college considers 6 credit hours the minimum amount to carry to be considered a part-time student and qualify for finanical aid.  My courses are primarily on campus.  It is definately more stress and leaves less time for a social or family life.      I work four 10-hour days.  I don't have much of an opportunity to do homework at work, and oftentimes I am drained after a long day and unable to focus on school work.  That leaves three days for me to take care of family, run errands such as grocery shopping and doctor appointments, and then there's the homework!    A general rule to help you determine what you can handle:  For every hour of class, figure two hours of homework.  Online courses are a little more difficult to determine since you don't have scheduled "class time", but I would say every credit hour equals one class hour.      By this method, if an online class is worth 3 credit hours and you attend an actual class for 3 hours, that's 6 hours of class.  If 2 homework hours for each hour of class.... that's 12 hours of homework to consider.      Remember, you have a set time for the ground class, but you don't for the online class.  Add the original 3 hours for the "classroom" time of the online class and you are looking at 15 hours of homework to complete in a week's time.    If you think you can fit it in, then do it!|`|8cgfTAOeaa	You should be able to.

Write about something funny that happened to you today, a favorite memory, or an embarrassing moment. Sure those sound like something out of a TAKS prompt but you have to start somewhere.    If you want to write something more interesting, write about a strange dream you had.    Write about a day in the life of something strange, like a dog or a pencil sharpener.

So you can start during your spring semester and continue the course over the summer. That way you wouldn't need to cram during the summer.

It's usually English, Humanities, Cultural something or other - Like music or art, sometimes a foreign language, etc.  It's always different for each person's particular situation.|`|cMZEmpp0aa	Yes, though there are different kinds of required classes. Sometimes you might have to take a specific class -- e.g. everyone might have to take English 101. You will probably also be required to take certain TYPES of classes or classes that meet a particular requirement. For example, the school where I did my graduate work has a "diversity" requirement that all students had to fulfill, but there was a long list of classes they could use to fulfill that requirement. And of course you are required to take certain classes for your major, usually a combination of specific classes that all majors have to take and classes that you must take to fulfill specific requirements (e.g. you might be required to take a certain number of classes at the 100, 200, 300, and 400 levels, but you can choose which classes you take to meet that requirement).

Hy0tRECMaa	When transferring from one college to another, it is required that an official transcript be sent to the office.  Most often, the current (or old) college upon request, will mail out an official transcript to the other college.    The idea is that the new college receives a sealed transcript from the previous college(s).  Any transcripts not in a sealed envelope will not be considered official, and cannot be considered for actual credit evaluation.      However, for the purpose of talking to a career counselor or academic advisor, you can use an unsealed copy, whether it's an "official" report or not.    Remember:  Nothing is set in stone and accepted by the new college until they received a sealed copy direct from your previous college(s) and reviewed.

lzEuuseJaa	No, your scores are not bad at all, they're average and above. When you score in the 50 percentile, it means that you've scored as well or better than half of the kids taking the exam. 81 percentile means you're in the top 19 percentile, you scored better than about 81 percent of other ISEE test takers. That is compared to private school kids, who test higher than public school kids.      Some schools have a very rigorous curriculum, basically all honors or AP  classes, nothing easier. Those types of schools would like very high ISEE scores. But I looked at St. Agnes's website and it looks like an excellent school, but one with a wide range of student abilities. Your scores should be fine. And remember, your ISEE scores are not the only thing they'll be looking at, they're just one part of the picture.    Good luck!

AlCfnJKYaa	It's a nautical expression of surprise which refers to ships timbers moving  against each other in heavy seas and startling the sailors.|`|r5Mxre6Saa	Shiver my timbers  Meaning    An oath, expressing annoyance or surprise.    Origin    Those of a certain age will remember Robert Newton, rolling his eyes and yarring it up in his archetypal Hollywood pirate role - Long John Silver in the 1950 film Treasure Island.     Robert Louis Stevenson used shiver my timbers several times in the original 1883 book, for example:     "Well, he [Old Pew] is dead now and under hatches; but for two year before that, shiver my timbers, the man was starving!"    Of course, Newton made the most of such 'parrot on the shoulder' phrases and it also appears several times in the film's screenplay. Newton's version, like that of all self-respecting stage pirates, was shiver me timbers, with the occasional 'aaarh, Jim lad' thrown in.    The first appearance of the phrase in print is in Frederick Marryat's Jacob Faithful, 1834:    "I won't thrash you Tom. Shiver my timbers if I do."    One meaning of shiver, which is now largely forgotten, is 'to break into pieces'. That meaning originated at least as early as the 14th century and is recorded in several Old English texts. A more recent citation, which makes that meaning clear, is James Froude's Caesar; a sketch, 1879:    "As he crossed the hall, his statue fell, and shivered on the stones."    So, the sailor's oath shiver my timbers, is synonymous with (if so and so happens then...) let my boat breaks into pieces. The question is whether any real sailor used the term or whether it was just a literary invention. Well, we can't be sure, although the fact that it actually means something and isn't just Newton-style hokum must count in favour of it being an authentic sailor's oath.|`|AA11431433	Only one v in shiver nutter...|`|KMoWaeIbaa	Yes i do know.

"my goodness!") as can be seen in Poor Jack a song from 1789 by Charles Dibdin.   Harry: I say it's false.   John : False! Shiver my hulk, Mr. Buckskin, if you wore a lion's skin I'd curry you for this.     According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the expression "shiver my timbers" probably first appeared in a published work by Frederick Marryat called Jacob Faithful (1834). After an argument over grog, Tom's father has his wooden leg (timber was slang for a wooden leg) trapped between some bricks and is unable to move. Tom agrees to assist him on the condition he will not get a beating.   "I wont thrash you, Tom. Shiver my timbers if I do."   "They're in a fair way of being shivered as it is, I think. Now, father, we're both even."     "Shiver my timbers" was most famously used by the archetypal pirate Long John Silver in Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure Island (1883). Silver used the phrase seven times, as well as variations such as shiver my sides, shiver my soul and shake up your timbers.     Timbers can refer to wooden legs or even just to legs and in the nautical context it can be used to mean the timber of the ship too.|`|MINy26pjaa	It is employed as a literary device by authors to express shock, surprise or annoyance. The phrase is based on real nautical slang and is a reference to the timbers, which are the wooden support frames of a sailing ship.

1j8mlvkkaa	You're more than fine. I'm sure there are going to be tons of schools that are begging you to come there. :-) Junior year is always the kicker, senior year is more laid back and much easier. My GPA dropped during Junior year too, and I still got into every college I applied to, and am currently attending a tier 1 school. So don't worry. Colleges will look at your grades and be impressed that you tried so hard in high school and took school seriously. I also know some people who had horrible GPA's and got into college on their SAT/ACT scores. They also look at extra curriculars and stuff too, so I don't think you have anything to worry about.

We would like to point out that luckily he was safe and had been collected by someone else, however, what if he hadnt? we are not talking about older children here we are talking about babies, who will go with whichever hand is put out to them, would your teachers lack of responsibility and dilligence if a stranger took a child by simply walking in at home time lead to an enourmous lawsuit?

hyHvG1Olaa	We live in a society where no one wants to accept responsibility for their actions therefore it is easier to blame someone else.  Parents who do not have time for their kids due to job constraints, social obligations, or just poor parenting are going to take the easy way out and blame the teacher for their inadequacies consistent with their parenting skills.    In regards to lowering the standards we already have lowered the bar considerably over all in education.  This is due to many reasons but as a professional educator I feel the parents must bear some of the blame. The rest of the blame, at least in the western societies goes directly to the society as a whole.  The BBC ran the results of a study that pointed out that watching over two hours a week of TV a week or playing over two hours a week of video games had a direct correlation to the grades a student received in school.  They also reported a study that showed teenagers need more than just 8 hours of sleep a night to learn and be successful in school.  Parents and society must bear the burden for allowing excuses to overcome good judgment.    Teachers, as a general rule, know all the aforementioned so they keep accurate records of all conversations, keep attendance excuses, and maintain an up-to-date phone log of all calls to parents.  This way when someone says to the teacher, "it is your fault ___ is failing" s/he has a way to prove to the parents, the administration, and society at large that the fault lies outside the teacher's control.    i would hold all students to the fire to complete their work or suffer the consequences and in over 25 years in the classroom I have repeatedly stood my ground.  This means all assignments and expectations are in writing and the grading criteria is included as a matter of course.|`|FmYkUfIDaa	HI Blue,  Recently I purchased an excellent Training Package containing information about a system of recording student/parent information that will address the issues you have raised above.

First, are you talking about students who can't or won't work?  Are they failing because they're lazy?    You say "for having to lower the standards because the kids cannot do the work."  That's a totally different issue than the laziness and lack of parental involvement.  If I'm the teacher, and the student cannot do the work, I have not taught it correctly.  It is my challenge to figure out how to reach every student so that they all succeed.  It's a difficult challenge, but it's what I'm there to do, nonetheless.  Have I always succeeded at that?  Heck no.    Now, as for the kid who WON'T do the work and the parents don't care, that upsets me when I'm blamed.  I will make sure I offer that student every opportunity to succeed so that if s/he fails, I can defend myself.

a5efe275182115a58cc24e44f27eae2baa	Very common.  I'm in my seventh year (second degree) and it's still a major pain to pick up a book.   a couple of things that are really important are to take good notes (so while you are reading you are really just skimming for points that expand on what you learned in class - the more active your brain is, the less it will be able to stray) and to shut off the computer.  Most important, though, is to shut out the monkey chatter in your brain - the inner monologue that distracts you and keeps you concentrating on your goal. For that, try meditation techniques... a simple one is to sit with good posture, but comfortably, close your eyes and breath deeply -- feel your stomach rise and fall...if your chest is heaving that is bad... then count backwards from 100 without breaking your concentration. At zero youget to work.  I used to work with a TV show on in the background (like the Simpsons, all of which I've seen a million times) to distract that part of my brain... that doesn't seem to work so well now, so it's a good night's sleep and sitting at a clear desk with nothing but the book, a highlighter, a pen and some paper.  Not getting out of bed is a sign of depression... maybe you are putting just a little too much stress on yourself.  All the best.|`|9e4cc937385b500f07dcfe521561dfc1aa	I had a similar problem...I couldn't get a routine. But, you just have to clear your mind and get out of the house and study on campus! that helps like crazy. Try to do as much as you can WITHOUT a computer so you won't surf the web. It can become addicting and I became addicted and it resulted in gaining weight, more stress and bad grades and no sleep.     So, go study outside of your comfort zone and without a computer. You have to just do it. That is the bottom line. And work when you feel like it don't force things but get stuff done! If not it will become too late to regret.|`|uM962JSzaa	haha that's why i'm on here right now! because that essay won't stop staring at me...

UA8USXFNaa	The problem is that the deadline for applying for uni to start in September has already passed - it was in January. Even if you could still apply, I have never heard of a course which allows you to do a full A level in a few months. Home study might technically be possible but I don't think you should underestimate how much coursework etc you would need to do - also I think you need to go to a registered examination place to take the exams, which would be at the same time as everyone else in May/June. I really don't think you would be able to cram that much work into two or three months. My advice for you would be to go to your local college and book an appointment with an adviser there asap. They can give you your options - it may be that it would be better for you to enrol on an Access course starting this September and then go on to uni the next year, or they may have condensed one year A levels available. I don't think it is a good idea to try and get into uni as a mature studnt without having done Access or A levels as another poster suggested - for a start, I think it is very unlikely any uni would accept you. It is possible for mature students to get in without A levels etc but this only usually applies to older people, as in 25-30+, who have had a lot of life experience and possibly some kind of career beforehand. At your age universities would expect you to get some qualifications before applying. Secondly, even if you were to be offered a place, I would think very hard about jumping straight into a degree level course if you haven't done anything academic for several years. I'm speaking from experience here - I didn't have any qualifications before doing an Access course a couple of years ago. I am now at uni, doing really well and on course for a first. I can honestly say that if I hadn't done the Access course before university I would have  been completely and utterly out of my depth, and might very well have dropped out. At university there is very little learning support, you are expected to know how to research, write essays etc and just get on with it yourself, so if you go in there without much recent academic experience you may find it very hard. For the same reason I would really recommend that you do a full year's study before going on to university, even if it were possible to take the A levels in a couple of months and go to uni in September (and I'm 99% sure it's not possible!). Personally I would say the Access course is the best option for you, they are great preparation for degree level work and are viewed very favourably by universities. Good luck!|`|7deb425958c53615415ce326bcbf08e0aa	Why don't you check with the uni what they want in the way of qualifications? You are a mature student so you may not need  A Levels. The uni will advise you.|`|Tjr9aObNaa	Nope. Unless you study distance courses and even then the time may take more than the time you have. Try http://www.icslearn.co.uk/gcse-A-level/a...  They aren't cheap mind..good luck!|`|nfOxiQ2zaa	Not much of a chance in my opinion.    Media Studies you can probably do in a week, but its useless and Universities basically laugh at it.|`|QwbmE07faa	There's a very slight chance you might be able to. As long as the college you go to is a good reputable one. You could ask about becoming a private student (you are given the work via post and you complete it at home then go into college for your examinations). However due to the fact there isn't much time left between now and September it is quite unlikely this will happen.    Good luck though.

rupIlSpDaa	If you are talented at many things and have an interest in a wide range of things, then, for you, there is NOT one true path.  What everyone is looking for is a path to their happiness.  To be happy with what we do with our lives really involves two things.  A big part is finding something we love to do that makes us happy.  But, the other part is learning that every job in life has its "dirty socks."  Even if you find something you love to do, you will find parts of it that are not pleasant.  That's just the way life is.  Everything is filled with both positive and negative elements.  We have to learn to focus on the positive and accept the negative without spoiling it all.    So, if you want to be happy, find something you really enjoying doing and then get all the education and training you can to become really good at.  If you love what you do, you will want to become really good at it.  And, if you are really good at something you love to do, there will be people who will be willing to pay you to do it.    If you don't know, yet, what you have a passion for, you can start exploring different things.  Talk to people and go visit workplaces where they do the things that might interest you.  Try to get a part-time job of any kind is such places so you can see firsthand what is involved.  Go to college and start taking a lot of different classes.  You will find some classes that are very interesting to you and that will help you to find a direction also.    You're not looking for ONE path.  You are looking for A path that can make you happy.|`|XzLUA7ataa	Think about where you are truly needed.

R5UIMBvcaa	Keep in mind that a participle is a verb form used as an adjective, or with a form of "have" to form a perfect tense.  The present participle of any verb ends in -ing, and the past participle of a regular verb ends in -ed.  For an irregular verb, the past participle is the third principal part, which you probably memorized for an English class a few years ago.    So look in those sentences for any examples of what I just described.  Then look right after them for nouns.  Do those participles describe those nouns?  There are your participle (or "participial") phrases.  Note: in one sentence, the participle itself is two words, one of which is an auxiliary, and in two other sentences the participles are THREE words each.  All three of these examples begin with the same word.    Now you should be able to do them for yourself!  If you try and are still stuck, email me.

So I'll do the first one for you and then give you hints on the other ones.    22.  The river is 410 miles long of which 112 miles is navigable.  So the navigable portion is 112 out of 410, or 112/410.  Now all that's left is to 'simplify' the fraction by finding numbers that will divide into both number equally.  Divide by 2 and you get 56/205.  I don't think you can go farther than that.    23.  The ratio of animals to plants is 128:144 (ratios are like fractions but expressed with colons, or at least they were when I learned this a long time ago).  Now simplify.    24.

(unless your teacher has a prefference of one over the other) in either case you would write it as 128/144 and simplify.    for 24. this one requires a simple addition in order to complete. simply take the sum of silver medals and bronze medals and use that as your denominator. then use the number of gold medals as your numerator. so it should be 16/42, before you simplify.    to simplify fractions just find the largest number that will divide into both the numerator and denominator evenly.  so for the fraction 5/10 since both are divisible by 5, the simplified form would be 1/2. if both numerator and denominator are even, you can simply divide by smaller numbers like 2 or 5 until you can't find any numbers they can both be divided by evenly.

Okay, now that that is over with, I think that even though there's nothing you can do at this point, your teacher has the responsibility to let her studends do the best they can. You obviously have the ability, now why didn't that happen?    The make-up work seems to be the biggest culprit here, missing assignments is always worse than messing up a few things. Was it her responsibility to give you the work after it had already been due the first time? Probably not. That's your department as the person attempting to catch up. If you had asked her for all of the make-up work and she only gave you some of it, then it's totally her fault. As for the guess at your grade, that could've have been a poor guess based on your test scores, or your apparrent abilities, or how well you did on any given assignment. I doubt she took everything into account as she should have.    I'm sorry you had to get an F, I had to do night school, but it was totally my own fault!

AA12374240	ok, you filled out a fafsa which will help your college to determine what federal aid you are eligible for. fafsa also sends this data to ny state higher ed and they used it to award you a tap award which is a state grant. now, there is also money that universities have that can help needy and/or academically gifted students. each university has its own rules for determining who is eligible for this aid. i went to fordham and i know they have grant in aid which they offer to needy students. you should contact the financial aid offices of the schools you listed on the fafsa. they should be able to give you a detailed analysis as to what you might get in terms of aid if you choose to attend that school.
yGOmMQP7aa	You apply after January (and after your parents have done their taxes) your senior year in high school.|`|AA12374240	there's no point in applying this year. each year, you will need to reapply for the upcoming year. for example, any student attending in 2009/10 will fill out an application once they have completed their 2008 tax returns. so, in the example, most students will file sometime between now and april when taxes are due. next spring, when you and your family do your tax returns, you will fill out a fafsa for 2010/11. and you will do it each spring until you are done with college. so, to answer your story in a super roundabout way, filling out an application now is pointless because it's only good between july 2009 and june 2010.|`|9ff50eac6fa480a892f8f42861f11968aa	You have to know where you're going to college first.

EWDSI8P2aa	1) ratio is like putting something against anothet, such as "for every sugar you use you must use 2 milks". So the ratio would be..    1 sugar : 2 milk  1 : 2    So, using this for your question..    12 pennies : 5 quarters  12:5    Then..    15 nickels : 7 dimes  15 : 7    Now we need tocompare which ratio is bigger, so we need to get the last number the same on both, the easiest way is to make it end in the last numbers times by each other so..    7 x 5 = 35.    To get 12:5 to end in 35, times both sides by 7 so..    84 (pennies) : 35 (quarters)    Then same for 15:7, times both by 5 and..    75 (nickel) : 35 (dimes).     Now we can compare them fairly and we see pennis to quarters has the larger ratio above nickel to dimes so pennies to quarters is the answer.     2)     48 x 10 = 480  48 x 10 + 48 (48x11) = 528  528 + 48 (48x12) = 576    So 2 left after 48x12, 2 divided by 48 = 0.4     So the answer is 12.4, or just use a calculator lol    3)   5lbs for $5.28  10lbs for $9.75    Basically, times the first one by 2 so they have an equal amount of lbs so you can compare them fairly (like in 1) )    5lbs for $5,28 x 2 = 10lbs for $10.56    We can see this one costs more than the second one so    10lbs for $9.75 is the better deal.     Hope thats helped!!|`|lD4r2yD4aa	Pennies to Quarters is 12/5 = 2.4  Nickels to Dimes is 15/7 = 2.14  just  use simple division  578/48 = 12.04 rounded off  If 5 pounds are 5.28 then 10 pounds would be 10.56 which is more that $9.75 so $9.75 is a better deal|`|EOr8VoEVaa	ratio of pennies to quarters 12:5  ratio of nickles to dimes 15:7  12/5 = 15/7  2.4= 2 and 1/7  2.4 is bigger so pennies to quarters is bigger    578 divided by 48  about 12.02    10 lbs for $9.75 is a better deal|`|1Y0TNKCeaa	1st Math Problem:                             Pennies to Quarters: 12:5 or 12/5                            Nickels to Dimes: 15:7 or 15/7   Convert 12/5 and 15/7 to a mixed number, you get:   12/5- 2 2/5  15/7-2 1/7  Both have a 2, so is 2/5 or 1/7 bigger  Find the LCD, you get: 35  The tw0 fractions are now  2/5- 14/35  1/7- 5/35  14 is bigger than 5 so the answer is NICKEL TO DIMES    2nd problem: 11.10    3rd problem:   10 pounds for $9.75

10ec2402caeee91ef5014d242e689852aa	they are 13 and 31 - thus the sum is 44    perimeter of square = perimeter of rectangle    4 (2x+6) = width  + width + length + length    8x + 24 = w + w + (4w - 10) + (4w - 10)    8x + 24 = 2w + 8w -20    8x + 24 = 10w - 20    Then I simplified the equation by dividing both sides by two (you can do anything you want to an equation as long as you do the same to both sides)     4x + 12 = 5w - 10    Then I pick 2 numbers and tried them.  The first two numbers I tried worked:  x = 2 and w = 6    4 (2) + 12 = 5 (6) - 10  20 = 20    Or try to plug it back into the original unsimplified equation:    4 (2) + 24 = 10 (6) - 20  40 = 40    Then, take the numbers you found and use them to find the area    Square:  area = L x L  area = (2x + 6) x (2x + 6)  area = (2(2) + 6) x (2(2) + 6)   area = (10) x (10)  A = 100    Rectangle:  area = L x W  A = (4w - 10) x W  A = (4(6) - 10) x 6  A = (24 - 10) x 6  A = 14  x 6  A = 64

6itO1EuGaa	Definetly not a word (check the official Scrabble dictionary at Hasbro.com).      My guess is just as the person above stated...you're in 'challange' type game, where any word is accepted and it's up to the other person to challange it or not.|`|Ru8Ba6Eqaa	There are 2 possibilities. One is that you're playing the game type Regular, and the game just so happened to glitch in your favor. I doubt this though, which makes me think that your game type is Challenge. When you start a game of this type, it means that you can play any word that you want, as ridiculous as it is. However, it is up to your opponent to challenge the word if he/she does not think it is a word. If they are wrong, they lose their turn and you make another play. If you are wrong, you take your word off of the board and they make a play. In this case, your word is definitely not valid, so if he challenges it, you will lose your turn and he will get to play.

AA11604732	SUNY also has "University" as part of its name.      You are right -- neither school is considered very selective -- but it is nice for you to have a couple acceptances under your belt.  St John's is the single ugliest campus that I have ever seen.    You are also right that going to SUNY-P may allow you to transfer to one of the better SUNY schools.  And if it doesn't, you can always just put SUNY on your resume.    You are also right that going away for school would be a good idea.    I see no real advantages of St John's over any SUNY school.    Let's hope you get more options in the next couple of weeks.  Good luck.
X1d5mCtUaa	Well, first of all, they just changed the requirement from between 250 and 500 words to a minimum of 250 words (no maximum). I wanted to let you know because I just found out after having worked realllly hard trying to cut down the length of my essay.  So, when choosing your topic, make sure it is something that really shows who you are. It can be something simple or complex. For instance, a girl in my school (who just got into an ivy league college) wrote her essay about her experience with teeth whitening - a really random and simple experience, but she was able to show who she was and relate the experience to life. You may also want to choose something that you believe "defines" you. It can be an experience, an accomplishment, someone you look up to. Really, it can be anything..which is the great part....but also the hard part.   In the actual writing part, don't make it too long because admissions people won't want to sit there and read a ten page essay. Use lots of figurative language, but don't over do it. Some metaphors, similes, imagery are great ways to elevate your essay.   REVISE REVISE REVISE!! There is nothing that will send your essay into the trash faster than typos or grammar mistakes...well, except plagiarism. Which is my next point. If you use ANY outside resources, make sure you do a parenthetical notation AND a works cited page. Colleges are huge sticklers for plagiarism...so be very careful not to plagiarize.   Have an intriguing title so it will grab the readers attention.  Make sure your conclusion paragraph and last sentence are really strong because that will be the final impression you leave on the admissions person. Be sure to connect whatever you write about to the "big picture," or life in general.   Good Luck!! You'll do great!!|`|ok0kpxsBaa	One of the most important things you can do is to make certain that there are no spelling or grammar errors in your paper. Make sure you use homonyms correctly as well. (For example: there, their, and they're)    It might also help to have a peer or teacher edit your essay for you. Two heads are better than one. You will no doubt read and reread your essay until the words don't even make sense to you. Advice from someone who hasn't read your paper before is invaluable. It will give you perspective you can't get alone no matter how smart you are.    I wouldn't recommend using essay editing services that are advertised online.

I skipped practically everyday of school just because the teachers sucked. But don't get me wrong I knew that I had to make up for it and I planned that out because I just wanted to have the most fun I could during highschool. That summer after my freshmen year me and my friend Nick drank a bottle of 80 proof every night by shot after shot, so practically half and half haha. I'm a senior now and I don't drink anymore but I smoke marijuana atleast four times a day and I'm going to college, but I'm not incouraging you to mess up like that because I knew what I was gonna have to make up. Good thing I wasn't held back a year and what not and I'm still graduating with my class but that was through heavy planning. So the easy way out is to just not ditch and do work, party on the side and you'll be fine haha.

dnA6sAFqaa	This sentence is not written in English. The grammar is wrong and the choice of words are wrong. The word "why" means nothing at all here.   This looks like an attempt to write English by someone with a weak command of english or else using an online translator.    I think it may mean to say:  "I would say that the gas would catch fire if they put the switch on"    Having said that, it is really ambiguous. Is the word "switched" supposed to mean an electrical switch (eg switched the power on) or does it mean "switched" as in "exchanged"/"changed places with"?  More information would be needed to attempt a better answer.|`|R5UIMBvcaa	I can't think why anyone used "why" in that sentence!  "Why" means "for what reason."  Your suggestion of "if" is better.

820d554e7094763dac38ae760d9a7286aa	It seems that both you and the teacher have some good points in your arguments.  Overall, though, I think she's correct, if a little abrupt.    I researched college prerequisites for basic chemistry, and almost every school requires mathematics proficiency at least through intermediate algebra.  So it is not unreasonable for the instructor to expect the students not to need specific math instruction.    I would expect the instructor to have gone through some of the calculations of the sort that were on your exam, so you could see how the math applied to the chemistry problem.    It is nice when teachers give you a review before the test.  But in college, you are expected to be far more independent and self-driven than in high school.  You should plan on doing your own studying, and scheduling an appointment with the instructor during her office hours if you have additional questions.    If you and your classmates compared exams and discovered that most of the mistakes were indeed math errors, then you all know what you need to work on.  Don't get so focused on new material that you forget what you already know.  If your math skills are rusty, maybe some of you should get together for a little extra study time.    If you find that the wrong answers were more about chemistry and less about math, then the problem lies with both the students and the instructor.  If she is doing a good job teaching the material, the class shouldn't be having this much difficulty.  However, college chem is more difficult than the usual high school version.    If I gave an exam and well over half of the students failed it, I would be looking at what I had taught and how, as well as how I had constructed the exam.  That doesn't mean she did poorly; it may mean that she didn't emphasize the requisite knowledge and skills to the class adequately.  Now you know.    No, I don't think you have a terrible teacher.  I do think that college is rough, and the onus is on the student to keep up.  There really isn't time for retakes or reviews.  Now that you all know her style, you should be better able to keep up with her and learn the material.    I do sympathize.  My freshman year in college I flunked Chemistry 101 -- the professor gave me a D 'cause I tried really, really hard!

d9157449b4296a78a2d93140eae05e2baa	let me see if I have this right:    p = -1/-8 = 1/8  q = 3/-4 = -3/4  r = 3/8    Positive/Positive = Positive  Positive/Negative = Negative  Negative/Positive = Negative  Negative/Negative = Positive    To add all these fractions together, they all need to share the same denominator (number on the bottom of the fraction).  You can multiply a number by 1 and still have the same number, so:  q = -3/4 = (-3/4)*(2/2) = (-3*2)/(4*2) = -6/8    So:  p+q+r =  1/8 + (-6/8) + 3/8 =   (1 + -6 + 3)/8 =   (4 + -6)/8 =  -2/8 = reduce top and bottom  -1/4|`|rROyFAMFaa	First start as -1/-8 + 3/-4  + 3/8  then convert 1/8 + -3/4 + 3/8  next combine like terms so 1/8 + 3/8 = 4/8   Next convert -3/4 so it has the same denominator as 4/8  So just double the -3/4 so you get -6/8  Next add -6/8 + 4/8   to do this add 4 to -6 which equals -2  keep the denominator so you get -2/8 and in simplest form its -1/4|`|GQJxXOaeaa	i bolieve that it's -1/4

ugRN86bYaa	Yes, good use of the word!  I'd reword the sentence like this.  At this, not only does Hamlet realize his disgust for his mother's actions, but he also finds that he abhors all women and their love in general.     I might also take out "in general"  I don't know.

I like to look at it as a way of getting past something that i dont understand without taking my grades down in flames. Cheating for everything would just be stupid.

While in Serbia, Princip joined the secret Black Hand society, a nationalist movement favouring a union between Bosnia-Herzegovina and Serbia|`|9002243f0fe92d658f5205b2667e158daa	Gavrilo Princip was a Serb who killed the above named emperor. He used to live in Sarajevo, Bosnia & Herzegovina prior to the First World War. He wasn't a member of the secret Black Hand Society, but he was a member of so called Mlada Bosna (Young Bosnia). Black Hand used to operate in Serbia, while Young Bosnia was formed in Bosnia. Black Hand Society supplied Young Bosnia with weapons and therefore I guess the other answerer wrote Gavrilo was a member of it. Right before the First World War, Bosnia was occupied by Austro-Hungarian empire, but before the Austro-Hungarians came, there was Ottoman empire established in the whole of Bosnia as well as in Serbia. He was killed right after his assassination of Franz Ferdinand. This world-famous assassination is considered to be the trigger for the start of the First World War.|`|qeGbaq6Yaa	Yes, he was a Serb.

Hy0tRECMaa	I'm sorry, but I cannot answer it in the form you wish.    All three have equal respect.  It depends on the field you wish to be involved with.    A business professor would have an understanding about business ethics, stock market analysis, and all things related to establishing and running a business.    A communications or journalism professor would have an understanding about language and writing, as well as the media that communicates the information.    A law professor would have an understanding about the various laws that protect our rights and safety.      However, of the three I would think a law professor would be most versatile.  You can teach about business law or journalism rights for students following either of those paths as well as computer law, medical law, and many others following their own educational paths.    The point is, you follow your interests.  Whatever you choose, you will have the degree and title of Professor.  You will have students who will look up to you for advice.  Respect is earned, however.  The way you treat your students and fellow peers determine "most respectable".|`|T35cykdUaa	I would rank:    1. Law professor  2. Business professor  3.

OikNR8Ufaa	Fake a panic attack and go to the school nurse before PE lesson. Tell her you'd been freaking out about doing PE because you were worried you weren't up to it, say you didn't like to tell anyone but you think you are ill and every time you exercise you get chest pains and feel like passing out, and that you worry about doing sport and getting chest pains so much that you make yourself not be able to breathe even before doing sport. Don't give too much information, you are aiming to have the school nurse wondering is it just panic attacks or is it something more serious? If she tries to make you go to class start acting like you are going to faint. Then the next PE lesson, go to class and say you are feeling unwell and need to sit out during the lesson, then the next lesson freak out before the lesson and go to the nurse. These inconsistencies will make it more believable. If they try to force you to go, say you feel faint, go into the toilet and dont come out, pretend you fainted in there and before eventually emerging splash lots of water on your face and look flustered.   If they try to force you to go to the doctor say you will be making an appointment and you do not want you mum to know because she is having a nervous breakdown right now and you cannot put any more stress on her right now as you think it will tip her over the edge. say you worry about her commiting suicide and say you only feel at peace and not like you are going to have a panic attack when you are engrossed in study and kept busy and are alone in the quiet and can concentrate.    You could also forget your PE kit and deal with the telling off. If they try to make you wear their scummy kit say you cannot because you are too self concious about your body and it makes you feel sick just thinking about it, say if makes you feel like crying all the time and keep apologising and looking suicidal.    If you just bunk off it might be cool too, bunking off PE is hardly a big crime, you're not going to get suspended for it or anything, and if your school would then you'd get warning first, then you play the 'I am falling behind in my studies and i didnt know any other way to keep up with everything so I dont become a failure' card.    and a tip, if you bunk off in the toilet dont put your feet on the floor, if someones checking for scivers they will see. If there are gaps under the doors big enough to crawl through, then lock a few of the doors and crawl out, so it looks like someones played a prank on the cubicle you are in, making them believe it is empty.    wow. I am quite a scheming *****, if you do not like lying please do not follow my advice! :P but these techniques used to work for me!! I was like you and just wanted to study during this time. PE staff hated me but I got good grades :)|`|t5Mz1aLvaa	Maybe you can get a doctors note. but, P.E. is improtant. You can stay in shape now but when you get older, you wont be able to do it as eaisly, which is why you should stay in PE to stay in shape and that you wont have a health problem or something.     my point: stay in PE, you'll be happy about it in the future...|`|E859HitSaa	Keep up PE.

Don't be too animated- just be expressive. Real is the world. Maybe natural. I, for one, do not like watching people give speeches when they look like they're trying to entertain a comedy audience. Your humor should be witty, and so you should come off as intelligent.    As far as your volume- Project, but don't yell. It should be enough to be heard without sounding obnoxious. It's more about your tone and rhetoric, anyway. If your words sound good and you're speaking in the proper ways, the volume isn't going to matter too much as long as the audience can hear you.    Giving speeches is all about happy mediums.|`|fgVb7Tscaa	use ur hands and body gestures...when u say sth it shd look like u actually believe in it v strongly ..(even if u dont..frm inside)    your whole body shd support what u r saying...  like if its positive..u shd look enthusiastic..ur tone happy n volume little up...  if it is negative, u shd look sad/sympathetic/angry/painful accordingly.....tone little lower side..    but beware ..dont overdo...  on top of it be ..natural and poised..

f714ef26ad8f0b92d25c68a6b4041d5daa	See the links below for information on both professions from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.      To be a pharmacist, you will need a college degree, and to be a psychologist, you'll need a doctorate.  In order to get into a good college, you'll need to take serious courses in high school (AP classes would be helpful).  Take four years of English, Math, Science, and History.  Also, participate in community service (volunteering) and extra curricular activities at school (clubs, band, dance, etc.).  You'll also need to be well prepared for the SATs and any other college entrance exams you might need to take.|`|iIsfZoMuaa	You need to start looking at schools and look at what their classes are.

I did mine here in columbus and the 25-75%  range make about 90-100k.  So good choice.      For a psychologist you need to take human development/child development, speech, research writing, statistics, psychology and sociology, what every your high school offers.  I have my BS in Psychology.  Most of my classes in college had english as a prereq but that was it.  The salary ranger here is 68-89k.|`|0wTB2OUIaa	Chemistry and Biology for starters. Also, courses in math would be a good idea, as you would be required to take them in university. some schools have pharmaceutical and toxicology courses, so you may want to keep an eye out for those, or any other courses that are health related.    as for a salary, most pharmacists make on average of 75 000 - 90 000 bucks a year in Canada and the U.S.
kppEhBBgaa	Yes, a witty satirical essay about birth control.  To me it seems as though there was an increase of poverty, and population.

Swift only wanted to show the turmoil in population growth in Ireland.

yJSPecgoaa	In your case, and from what you describe, it is very likely that you will do well as a homeschooler.    Though it is often the recommended treatment, I have yet to see serious social anxiety *cured* by forcing the person to remain in an unhealthy social environment, or to spend their days in an institution where they are constantly being judged (and often derided) both by their peers and by those in authority.      In addition, research has repeatedly found that any sort of emotional stress counteracts learning.  Emotional stress has a cumulative effect on your brain, especially its ability to remember and learn.    Given that you are self-motivated, mature for your age, and have a desire to be successful, I would say that you are also an excellent candidate for the style of homeschooling called Unschooling, which enables people to be *educated* rather than merely schooled.   At your age, you do not need your parents there all the time to be unschooled.  You just have to be self-motivated with a genuine desire to learn about whatever interests you most.      Theres no reason for you to be cut off from other people as a homeschooler.  Since your social anxiety seems not to serve as an impediment in *other* social settings (i.e. outside of school), where there is a mixture of age groups, you will have the opportunity to thrive socially in ways you cant in school. Many unschoolers have part-time jobsboth volunteer and paidin the areas that interest them, and and many are entrepreneurs, having allowed their special interest(s) to blossom into a business. By your interactions with others in environments that are much healthier than schools, your social anxiety is likely to subside quite impressively.    To help you with making your decision, I highly recommend that you read the following book:    The Teenage Liberation Handbook: How to Quit School and Get a Real Life and Education by Grace Llewellyn  At Amazon Online Reader, you can take a peek at the first page of the book.  You will likely be astounded to see how much you already are in tune with what Llewellyn writes on the first page alone:  http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/09629591...      Other books I recommend are:    Dumbing Us Down: The Hidden Curriculum of Compulsory Schooling, by John Taylor Gatto    Real Lives: Eleven Teenagers Who Don't Go to School Tell Their Own Stories, by Grace Llewellyn (editor)    Homeschooling Our Children Unschooling Ourselves, by Alison McKee    The Unschooling Unmanual,  by Nanda Van Gestel  [''The Unschooling Unmanual is a unique and empowering book about the growing trend of unschooling. It is the book to give to doubtful or fearing partners and family as well as anyone considering or interested in this life.'' - Dayna Martin, Unschooling America]    Whatever choice you make in terms of homeschooling, I wish you the very best.   Good luck.|`|ZSdLmfMCaa	I say do it. Things you need to keep in mind are that it's a lot of reading, you have to be motivated, and you need to stay social. Even if you have anxiety friends are important so keep in touch with people from school that you talk to.|`|jgS0WgHFaa	As a sufferer of anxiety I truly feel your pain. I highly recommend a home school curriculum. Using Google to search for a home school curriculum is a great start. It would be worthwhile if you can find someone who already home schools their child or children that are around the same age as you. You would still be around other peers, however it will not be as many as in a public school.  I hope this helps some. Private message me if you need any further help.  Ann|`|EuwGku8vaa	Poop!

Get them to color pictures of those animals..|`|816d0234ce66aef35ce88055d2729beeaa	The following arctic species  are on the list of endangered or threatened artic species: wolves, caribou, musk oxen, polar bears, seals, sea-lions, walruses, whales and several species of migratory seabirds and fish.    Some reasons are as follows:    -Carelessness ( animals getting caught in fishing nets, oil threats)    -The beginning of development in those areas ( disturbances- polar bears are sensitive to this)    -Commercial exploitation ( overfishing, whaling & sealing, and dwindling of fish owing to fishing of immature fish)    You could make a wall chart and do a classification activity. Have them colour and  then cut out the given listed animals. Name them by labeling. Then place or stick them under specific classification titles such as:    Endangered Species    causes:     Overfishing----Development----Careless... (and so forth to give them the idea)
akJJC3qkaa	You are probably looking at about 5-6 years of college. 4 years for a bachelor's degree in education, and another 1-2 years to get a master's degree in curriculum and instruction management. Most states are moving to requiring a master's degree in order to teach elementary school. Typical courses include history of education, methods courses (where different methods of teaching are presented), peer teaching, student teaching (where you are teaching children under supervision of an experienced teacher), a developmental psychology course, educational psychology course, as well as the typical general education courses all colleges require. It is a relatively involved degree. If there is a possibility that you would like to study a different field and go into education at the master's level, I would recommend doing so, just so you aren't stuck in a career teaching when you change your mind|`|RUf73hG1aa	I teach in IL and I went to school for 4 years.  Most schools do not want to hire new teachers right out of college with a master's degree because then they have to pay them more.  Get your bachelors degree, get a job, then go back for your masters if you want.    As far as classes are concerned, most of your first two years are going to be general education classes (chemistry, biology, history, algebra, calculus maybe, government, literature, english, etc.).  You don't get a lot of choice between those.  The farther you go in your program the more specific your classes become and the more choices you get.  Later on you might take children's literature, teaching elementary science, teaching elementary social studies, teaching elementary language arts, several elementary math classes (I had to take 4), students with special needs, several observation hours in local schools with established teachers, and lots more.  Your last semester of college will be full time student teaching in a classroom of the grade level of your choice (within their ability to place you there).|`|c10ae470c43a0d4c34c33a9eb61c4212aa	The requirements for becoming an elementary school teacher vary from state to state. In Pennsylvania, one must complete 4 years of schooling from an accredited college or university,  successfully  complete student teaching and pass the PRAXIS exam.     However, in order to keep an active teaching certificate, additional continuing education credits may be required.    Keep in mind that teaching well is difficult. A good teacher spends time outside the school day planning lessons, marking papers and creating a strong learning environment.  One must not only enjoy children, but have strong classroom management skills and the ability to adapt teaching to students with different needs.     I would recommend that you check out your states requirements. The University of Kentucky has an excellent site that links to the department of ed for all the states. www.uky.edu/Education/TEP/usacert.html     Look for a college or university that has a strong, well  respected education department. If that is not financially feasible for all 4 or 5 years, consider a local community college for your basic requirements and then transferring to the college or university.     On another note, I would strongly recommend that you get your certification in both special education and elementary education. Even if you do not plan on teaching special education, the experience and knowledge will make you a much stronger and well-rounded educator.     Good luck!

jc1HsCjMaa	First of all, if you act intelligently i dont think people will have any reason to make funof you.Alot of colleges now days are seeking out homeschooled young people becuae they seem to score as high,or higher on entrance exams,act more mature and are responsible young people. We gave our homeschool a name so when we did go somewhere during the day and someone asked "are you out of school today>" we simply said we are on a field trip with crossroads academy. If you are still in school,(homeschool),you might consider doing this. Also,when you have to make out transcripts for college showing where you went to school,it helps to have a name other than homeschool. get creative,you can name your school anything you want.As a homeschool student you and your parent/guardian can also use your school name to make name badges for you and your hometeacher,with these,you can get discounts at places like joann fabrics barnes and noble,michaels etc.... just ask when you go somewhere if they give teacher (if its a parent) or student discounts.all they can say is no right? check out  www.hslda.org for alot of information i cant cover here. if you are being homeschooled, enjoy and dont worry what other people think,in the end,everything just boils down to how you feel about you right?  blessings,  marietta

GzBkproMaa	11 and 12 are the most important years. They hardly look at grade 9, considering its your first start in a new place so you may not be able to perform your best because of the new environment.

Mainly your senior years - 11 and 12, but that doesn't mean you should slack off in grades 9 and 10.|`|96HaY6l4aa	ALL of them, but especially Sophomore and Junior.

pDvFwWujaa	It sounds like you're getting too excited and might be rushing it.     Don't worry about studying and memorizing everything. Just think about it. Really, driving is only safety and common sense. Look at the question, what it's saying, and then think to yourself: "Is it safe if this happens? If I did this, what would be the consequences?" Imagine what your parents or friends (if they're good drivers) do while they're at the wheel. If you think about it, I'm sure you can get it right.    The only thing you really need to memorize are the signs.     Good luck.|`|NMMYw8WDaa	You do this because you are allowing yourself to be victimized by that which is modern day beauty contests.

The mirror (and the fact that the boy and girl both frown when they see themselves in the mirror) is indicative that they  indicates that they are struggling with their self-image.    A. It shows the emphasis placed on physical features.    A is the correct answer here because both focus on their physical features.

They can put it in the trash can without worrying about the teacher catching them.|`|1khVEE6oaa	I had a teacher that implemented a 3 strikes rule.  We were allowed to eat or check gum in class so long as it wasn't disruptive.  But if he found trash on the floor (wrappers, crumbs, gum) then it would be a strike for the entire class.  So as long as we cleaned up after ourselves, we were fine.  He would staple his "evidence" of the strike to a bulliten board and it stayed there all year.  One class was not allowed to eat in class any longer after the first semester because they got their 3 strikes, but most classes did good.  It helped that the students made sure to check on each other because even if the trash wasn't theirs, it would still affect their privaleges.  So sometimes people picked up other people's trash as well.|`|idBqkqUSaa	Just tell the kids they can chew it, if they dont cause a distraction by it, and trow it away proberly.

jgS0WgHFaa	In my opinion it is up to you and your parents if home schooling is best. The proper steps depend on your state of residence. In North Carolina you only need to go to the department of Non-Public Education and file an intent to home school. http://www.ncdnpe.org/index.asp Once this is done you receive a card in the mail certifying the home school. It usually only takes a few days to receive the card. You will also have to have a home school curriculum and http://www.worldbook.com/wb/Students?cur... has basic guidelines for what students are learning in each grade.  I hope this helps.  Ann|`|7a9ca1e0d676415430d900245a7c2d25aa	I really don't think homeschool is the answer. It sounds like a medical issue that you need to discuss with your doctor. You need to get some help for the depression first. You can talk to your school if you are worried you will fall behind while getting help. Usually to get information on homeschool you need to go to the school board. They are the people willing to help with homeschooling. The standard school does not like to help with it because they will do everything in their power to keep you with them, as they get paid for every student that attends their school. Call the school board and talk to them about your situation.|`|tCsFxh5Aaa	Get help with the depression first.    Schools will offer you "homebound" where you do your lessons at home, but through the school system, if you can show that you are missing school because of a medical condition.  Depression and not wanting to get out of bed probably won't qualify, though.    There are lots of homeschooling programs.  Look up your local laws online to find out what you would need to do.  In our area, you would need to have your parents officially remove you from school and send a letter to the school district to let them know that you are being homeschooled and then you'd start whatever homeschooling program you choose--but different areas have different laws.    However, if you aren't willing to get out of bed, would you really get up out of bed to do any school work of any sort?  So, you need to deal with the depression first.  There are a few options you should consider.  First, you should try seeing a doctor to find out if there's a medical cause.  If something happened to you (or someone you know) that's causing the problem, you might need to see a therapist.  Talking to a clergyman or other religious person might be another option, depending on the cause of the problem.  Or you might need to force yourself to get involved in a good cause, to help someone else in order to get yourself to move past thinking only of yourself and your own problems.  But deal with the real problem...
AA11099505	When I needed my transcript, I had to send a letter addressed to the school requesting my transcript via fax.  Usually if you call the office at your high school, they will tell you what their school district's requirements are for getting transcripts.|`|AA10620879	You just call up the school your graduated from and ask them how do you get it?|`|0QAUbLMnaa	call the school office and they can fax your transcript to wherever it needs to go|`|X1d5mCtUaa	go to your high school or email a guidance counselor and ask for a copy of it.

Either that or one on why people should not tan in order to prevent skin cancer.

Try to persuade people that the skinny people that are WAY too skinny are not good role models for young girls to look up to. Little girls need a REAL WOMAN in their life as a role model that will influence them positively, because ince they hit puberty, and if they have been looking up to those sk*nks then they are going to become even more extremely ill!!!      Hope I made some sense!!!
a9YfUGzSaa	College can be COMPLETELY different if you want it to be.  I couldn't get a guy to give me the time of day until I started college and now I have to practically beat them away with sticks, it's absurd.  I was actually similar to you in that I was very quiet, and in 10th grade a guy I had a crush on actually said, "do you like hate me or something, or are  you just quiet?" and it was then I realized my quietness had been taken for a desire to be antisocial instead of shyness.    I met my boyfriend of one year our freshman year of college, just last year.  You do have to be careful because a lot of people are just looking for a good time, but not everyone.    The biggest difference for me in dating between high school and college was that in high school if you wanted to be someones boyfriend or girlfriend, you had to find a way to get them to be your friend first, be friends for a while, and then eventually they'd "ask you out" meaning you're a committed couple now.  But then when I got to college, you can ask a complete stranger out for coffee and it's not a big deal, and it's actually a great way to get to know someone.  It's much easier for me to go out on dates with people then have to try to infiltrate their clique of friends just to get to know them. :P|`|AA10948829	You can change your reputation right now by just going up and chatting with people more. Just because people currently think you're quiet doesn't mean you HAVE to stay that way.    There are plenty of people in high school who are just interested in sex and parties. And there are plenty of people like that in college too. Like my roommate. But there are people like me who get into real relationships instead.

1Dshgmywaa	I got into an excellent college with a 1110 SAT, 4.15 GPA, 3 AP courses (only passed 2 tests with 3's) and 3 extracurriculars.    I know getting into college is more competitive these days, but don't overload yourself like some people are suggesting. Do what you can in your mental capacity. Don't take on a whole bunch of stuff and stress yourself out to the point where you don't enjoy life.     Plus, if for some reason you DON'T get into the "good" school you want to, you can always go to any school (community college, etc.) and then transfer. I've transferred twice in my college career and am now at one of the top 50 schools in the nation.    Also, don't pick the Ivy League or brand-name school just for the name or the "prestige." I went to a brand-name school and it was full of pompous asses and the classes were horrible.    Don't kill yourself being an over-achiever.|`|FfhGqdgTaa	If you have great Sat scores, than YES|`|5cmulUUJaa	There probably will be some consideration, but by only a "few" honors and AP classes will really bring your credibility down as most people take as much as they can in their years of high school, along with doing the same extras that you do.|`|lCnoQuTnaa	You'll have to have a good essay response as well as good SAT/ACT scores, but I'm sure you'll be able to get into a number of "top" schools. It also doesn't hurt to visit the school and meet with admissions reps so they can put a face with your application. Best of luck to you.|`|8IyZphFVaa	you should try to join more clubs, challenge yourself as much as possible with AP courses, and keep your GPA as high as possible. the higher your ranking the better - like top 4-5%. doing more outside activities - academic summer programs or having a talent (playing an instrument) can help also. and good SAT scores. but every school is different. they place more emphasis on different things. i know ppl who got into ivy league schools with mediocre SAT scores, but because of sports and a high ranking or heavy participation in clubs got in. i also know people who were in the top 5 who got rejected probably because of not having enough sports or not having enough extracurriculars. the key is balance. if you are mediocre in one area make sure you are outstanding in another (outstanding for the extracurriculars/sports meaning being a captain or having an important role in an organization). also recommendation letters are very important. go to extra help and try to develop a decent relationship with teachers of subjects that you might be pursuing in college.
EoawVhBTaa	some community colleges will let you in but its really important to get a ged or diploma. if you can afford college you can afford a ged|`|5df4bea74fed72326766f2a8b46346b2aa	no college at all will let you in without a GED or a high school diploma so if you really want to go to college please get a GED or high school diploma
5df4bea74fed72326766f2a8b46346b2aa	i live in st. louis mo and there is no college that will accept you with out a ged or a high school diploma.    you asked this question before and some one told you that you can go to a community college with out any ged or high school diploma they where soooo wrong.     now if your still in high school you can do a duel enrollment  to a community college while your still in high school its best that you talk to the community college and get their requirements and talk to your high school counselor     but if your not in high school nor have a ged NO college will accept you|`|QWS32Fzdaa	First of all, you need to get your GED if you are not going to finish high school because    1.) A technical school or vocational school is for career training purposes and without having your high school diploma, you can not attend ANY college or university EXCEPT a technical or vocational school.     2.) You NEED a GED to attend a technical or vocational school, so you need to get either your GED or diploma either way.    3.) The reason you need atleast a GED to attend a technical or vocational school is because like I said before, these types of school are for career training and to be able to get certified for that career and then actually get HIRED for that career, you're required to have a GED or diploma.     Ex. Say you go to a technical school to learn cosmetology/hair stylist, you need your GED because once you are certified, and you look for a job, you won't get hired unless you have a GED or diploma anyway.     So to go to anytype of school, you need ATLEAST a GED.    Goodluck and hope this helped!
8SmMYdBLaa	You're really close... the only problem is the negative signs.     You were right to find a common denominator, and you were right that the common denominator is 5n!    The first thing that you should do is change the subtraction to adding a negative (you will see why soon) so you get 5/n + 3/1 + (- n/5)    lets take the first one first. To get 5/n to have a denominator of 5n multiply by 5/5 to get 25/n.    Now to multiply 3/1 by 5n/5n to get 15n/5n    And finally, multiply -n/5 by n/n to get -n^2/5n    This is the part where you got a little off track. Notice that I kept the negative sign with the -n/5 so all we did before is add all of the terms together (none were subtracted).     SO just add the three values we found together to get (25+15n-n^2)/5n

Going to McDonald's, but finding out you're visiting the first grown up McDonald's where the Happy Meal consists of broccoli and salad.  The playground is nothing but TVs showing Oprah.  The "toy" included is a nice new pair of socks.    Finally getting invited to Billy's 10 year old birthday party, but your parents insist on buying him a Barbie Doll.  The embarrassment that follows for the rest of the school year.    What you want to do is think of things children love.  Then think of the worst possible scenario for a child in that situation.  Then write an Alanis Morisette song to go along with it and call it "Ironic" that makes millions. Then get sued for copyright infringement and lose your whole life savings.  (See...it works for adults, too!)|`|cno2OHmzaa	Hearing my parents fight/shout at each other.  I would always go in my room, shut the door, and play to try and drown out the sound.

lQIKWXDuaa	DONT PANIC yet. The earlier you submit your FASFA the better so that you can meet the deadline for the school. You must obey your school's deadline not the federal deadline for your state.      Use an estimation to fill out the FASFA and check the "will file" box for your parents. After they file their income tax, You have to go back and make the necessary adjustment and check the "file" box.    The school receives money from the FED and they prepare a financial aid package for all the students that meet their deadline and that are accepted. The student package consist of grants, scholarships, Stafford and Perkin loans. The amount that you will received depend on your expected family contribution which is that EFC number that you will obtained after you submit your fasfa. Whatever amount extra that you need you have to get a private student loan which is credit base. Your financial aid award letter will help you decide what to do next. If you submit your FASFA info to the school after that their deadline, they might not have any funds for you.    ss|`|cV4tAnY2aa	Try school based scholarship  File your FAFSA Anyway  Try for state scholarships

I dont think its worth it to waste away ur 8th grade years, solely on school, have some fun and go out with ur friends. Even, carring this much  in 9th grade is still considered early, since the grades considered in college admitance is mostly on your 10th and 11th grade report cards.    the honors classes that are most important are English and Math, because, if you are good at english in highschool, they will usually let you take advanced level English, as well as History class.

eksHt5jnaa	Simply stated, students should study Shakespeare's works in school because of the incredible value within them. In addition to exposing students to a multitude of literary techniques, Shakespeare's plays challenge the student with difficult language and style, express a profound knowledge of human behavior and offer insight into the world around us.    William Shakespeare is recognized by much of the world as the greatest of all dramatists. The intricate meanings, extensive vocabulary, and powerful imagery contained within his works demonstrate the phenomenal story telling ability of the English playwright.|`|CvBJ3RKPaa	Because he was the greatest writer who ever lived.  In the year 2000, Time Magazine named Shakespeare the greatest person of the millenium.  His ability to embrace every kind of person, every dramatic or comic situation and every kind of story, plus his poetic ability sets him apart from all others.  His writing is part of the world's culture and the world's shared meaning.  There are constant references to Shakespearean characters in all the media, and hundreds of common expressions came from his plays.|`|Vu4SFGsqaa	I am going to take a crack at this.    he is an important part of the history of theater. He became so popular because his plays were so good and he is a good example of what we should follow.|`|NmkUEhyNaa	These days many of us don't know how to look for depth in a story. Reading Shakespeare requires us to do so. Also, many people don't read quality literature these days. By reading Shakespeare we do.

AEZ75dJ7aa	First do some online research about homeschooling laws in your state.  Your school district doesn't want you homeschooling because they get funding for each student enrolled.  Online schooling is a great way to get the rest of your education and graduate BUT--- check them out with the BBB and the state eduction dept for the state they have their offices in. DO YOUR HOMEWORK on this because you don't wanna screw up all the hard work you've already put into your education. I homeschool my daughter and she's doing really well and we are enjoying it more than when she was in public school three years ago.|`|VayJue7vaa	It's up to your parents - not your current institution. Currently, there is a better option for students like you. My cousin is involved in acting, and ends up traveling a lot. Because of this, he is enrolled in an on-line high school - a growing trend and a great alternative for students whose public schooling isn't working out and whose parents are not interested/ able to home-school. You should check them out.|`|HCWkdk4naa	you are close to graduating, so suck it up and finish.  your parents will tell you the same thing.  if you get a job, it will only make school even harder for you.  you will have an easier time getting a job with a hs diploma anyway

Because 12 + 9 = 21, carnations and daffodils are the two types that combine to be 70 %|`|40sHT54jaa	12+9+6+3 = 30  Therefore there are 30 flowers.    1) Since theres 9 daffodils out of 30 flowers you do 9/30 = 0.3 x 10 = 30%  So the percent of the flowerbed that is daffodils is 30%.    2) Daffodils = 30%  Carnations = 12/30 = 0.4 x 10 = 40%    So Carnations and Daffodils combine to equal 70%|`|fqrViOFsaa	1. 30%  2. carnations and daffodils

uqMK3rUZaa	AM  A.M.  am  a.m.  Ante Meridiem    Ante Meridian  Latin = "before midday"     before noon  PM  P.M.  pm  p.m.  Post Meridiem    Post Meridian  Latin = "after midday"       after noon  Afternoon          Terms 12 a.m. and 12 p.m. cause confusion and should not be used as neither the "12 am" nor the "12 pm" designation is technically correct.            It advisable to use 12 noon and 12 midnight where clarity is required.          To avoid ambiguity, airlines, railroads, and insurance companies use 12:01am for an event beginning the day, 11:59pm for ending it.  http://www.worldtimezone.com/wtz-names/w...    origin:  the use of A.M.(ante meridiem) and P.M. (post meridiem) dates back to some of the earliest sundials, which is why the meridian is set at noon rather than midnight. Second, 12 A.M. means "the 12th (of 12) hour before the meridian," not "12 hours before the meridian;" otherwise, 11 A.M. would occur one hour after midnight. And, since sundials and timekeeping predated the concept of "zero" by more than a millenium, the meridian was given a numerical value, hence 12 noon instead of 0 noon.   http://www.madsci.org/posts/archives/200...|`|AA10731562	A.M. - ante meridium  P.M.- poste meridium  The origin is Latin.|`|tG5PSmwAaa	Ante Meridiem (Latin: "before noon")   Post Meridiem (Latin: "after noon")

411a10352c444c2e97f87fafe76ed068aa	Your safest route would be to go after a clinical psychologist PhD.  From there you could add further training and certifications.  A PhD in clinical psychology could be used for other job tracks, also.  Nothing stays the same, and budget cuts flow through the JCS, as well as other fields.  A clinical psychology PhD would train you up in research, and research is how you can make effective changes in youths' lives.  You have to get into a program, and the competition is very stiff.  The benefit of a PhD over a PsyD was that you would get a salary from the school for the PhD teaching and research work.  With the PsyD, you gave the school HUGE amounts of tuition to do their research.  Schools favored mature students for the PhD track, usually.      One professor told me that what kept most people out of the program was the GRE test.  I called the University of Oregon, which has had a very excellent clinical psyc phd program and talked to them about it.  I found that if one had a master's degree in anything, one was automatically put at what she called "the second tier".  This might have been across the board for all schools.  It was nothing "official", btw.  But it seemed to be accurate.  You could get a master's in criminal justice.  There should be some targeting juvenile populations in treatment and custody, but you might get personal satisfaction in getting a master's in teaching.  That is what I did, then did on-call work for a juvenile detention treatment program.  It was so cool to turn everything into a learning experience for them, as well.  That way, you could go into teaching if you got burnt out with the custody track.   There are school counselors who used to work in custody, btw.  I met them.  I met a substitute teacher at the juvenile detention who said that she always worked in behavior classrooms, because the other students were so boring.      Also, a communications major would be a fantastic major.  I audited a negotiation and conflict class.  I was very impressed by the techniques of the field.  You can only learn them by such training, brick by brick.    just thoughts|`|SgKsHxD5aa	hmm. OK, im no professional or anything. but this is my advice for you    I would go for a criminal justice major.. in order to obtain this you have to take criminology classes, which is a type of psychology.    also, i would recommend minoring in psychology..    crim. justice major. psychology minor    i really think you can help ppl btw =]  good luck
yGOmMQP7aa	Yes.  I don't want to be making min wage until I'm 67 years old.|`|zLoyo24Taa	It depends on what you want to do in life.

50D3dFHWaa	When you go to open a new document their should be an option for resumes on the left hand side.  There are several different formats depending on what style you are in need of.|`|3mAgM405aa	Here are alternative format settings which can be incorporated into a Word 2007 resume.    Besides setting all margins to 1", the most important criteria for setting up a professional resume besides relevant text, is "scanability." Here are some helpful tips:    1. Place just below your identification header [your hame, address, phone, email address] any Conditional Warning Statement such as "Confidential Resume,"Do Not Contact Current Employer," etc.  2. Always fill-in an Objectives category [just below the Conditional Warning Statement] and make sure that he Objective will contribute to the profitability of your future employer;  3. Select a mono-type font such as Helvetica, Arial, Courier or Times Roman; do not select any cursive handwriting styles which cannot scanned;  4. Keep font sizes within a range of 10 to 12 pts.;  5. Avoid styling text with a justified alignment, keep it flushed left;  6. Instead of using tabs to set up blocked text entries, generate a table and use the column and row settings accordingly;  7. Do not place an i.d. picture anywhere on the resume, this is a major taboo due to discrimination issues;  8. Do not place any graphic text [saved as .gifs] onto the resume since it may be overlooked during the scanning phase;  9. List at the very end of the resume your interests which should include travel experiences, language skills, social interactions such as golf, team sports, tennis, etc.    In conclusion, the above helpful hints were designed to allow ease of scanning of your resume into PDF which can then be text captured for seach purposes by your potential employer. If the original resume was created in Word, WordPerfect or Mac Appleworks, it can be Saved As a PDF file which then can be saved as an email attachment. Otherwise, you can simply use a scanner and scan a hard copy of the resume and then save as a PDF file.     Failure to conform the resume to appropriate fonts and styles as outlined above will result in rejection of the resume simply due to the inability of the scanning device to properly index relevant resume entries.    Good luck!

Successful sea trials subsequently lead to a vessels certification for commissioning and acceptance by its owner.    As for the Academy, in this case you are the vessel being tested.

In fact, many professors, especially those who talk quickly and give a lot of detailed information in a short period of time encourage their students to do so.

Being the "Teachers Pet" is not a bad thing, people may dislike/hate you for it, but it's because they're jealous, worry about yourself. Where you get in life doesn't mean ANYTHING to them, they are just mad and jealous because you're smarter and better at the job than them. When you're older (and I mean like ancient old lol), chances are you won't have to deal with the people who are jealous. You'll be living a nice life, with plenty of money, so don't worry about them!

Sometimes, a B- or B+ isn't a 3.0, it could be a 2.7 or a 3.3 Same might go for a A- being worth 3.7...hope this helps

A phoenix bursts into flames, dies, and rises from the ashes to create itself again. A rebirth, if you please.

jU1639d4aa	I'm sure you can debate this, but to "get" something is to make an effort to achieve something, such as I go "get" a job.  To have something done is either to have completed it in present-past tense - I "have" finished my term paper, or it is to have taken an action where it will take place at a later time - I "have" taken care of him because the hitman is going to make him sleep with the fishes tonight.    So, in short, if you are going to do it yourself, you'd proably use "get" and if you're going to have something or someone else take care of something for you or you've already done it, use "have".    I'm not 100% on this, so if someone wants to add or clarify, I welcome it.|`|AA11872632	This is the "causative" mood in English.  There IS NO DIFFERENCE, don't let anybody tell you differently.    I get my hair cut at the Barbershop, by the barber.  I have my hair cut at the barbershop.  Or any English verb tense of the "causative":  I will have the car repaired tomorrow.  I had the house painted last year.  I should have had the furniture delivered...    When somebody else does the work, and you cause it to happen.  I cut my hair..myself.  (That is the present tense)|`|4bH6L9JSaa	dont u know the difference? lol    i do. but cant explain it :/    i think 'have something done' is more to have it done by someone else. i dunno.

aa6da2e7471c0ac26a11dab59b8e0de1aa	UC's primarily look at the sophomore and junior year, because applications for universities are due the senior year. Your able to go to any UC if you have the grades of C or above. But selection comes into play since the economy is bad. They will basically choose the A and B students when it comes to this. So take a look at the universities and see if they have lots of empty space.
fkuKUxrpaa	You have a good chance, and need a 3.6 UW GPA. Pepperdine requires some religion classes, but you'll fit in. I would keep it up and maybe try an honors math class. I would keep it up and get a SAT Kaplan book and get a practice book. Good Luck, and you still have time!

ZaYyXiJAaa	If you pay for school, then they have nothing to hold over your head. You're legally independent. Go home and take the car. If they object, tell them it isn't their choice. You need a car to pay for school, and if you cant take it, then you will just have to drop out.
65fc3847b67d2c0fa6bbc523caf1aa16aa	I agree that people should stay in school and get a good education, because especially now, jobs require a high level of expertise. If you don't have a skill that is rare, your employer has no incentive to pay you much. If you possess a skill that your boss or no one else in the office can do, they'd be hard pressed to ever let you go.    However, we like to talk about education as one of the most important aspects in our lives/society, but the reality is a lot of kids aren't mature enough to finish advanced degrees, don't have discipline or foresight, or are just too plain lazy. Also, a lot of kids honestly don't know what they want to do with their lives.|`|p3GZERIsaa	No way!! Omg!! The age is set so that's the minimum, this is because people need a good education!|`|a01a4c7fa42d359ddf53eaa686c7f84faa	No!  I disagree.  For most kids, to lower the age would mean that those who decide to leave school then would be even more immature than they are at the current age.  Kids, even at 17, which is the usual age I believe for allowing them to decide to drop out of school, aren't generally mature enough to undertand what they are doing to their future lives and livelihoods when they decide to drop out.  So certainly one wouldn't expect them to be able to make such an important decision at an even younger age.|`|yKoqj8u8aa	I disagree as people need a good education. Jobs are looking for people that have good grades and knowledge so people need to be taught at least until they're 16.

qQUKn2B9aa	First of all, you are probably in more danger not telling anyone than telling somebody. If you don't let anyone know then nobody is aware of it. What if something really did happen to you? Let an adult that you trust know. It doesn't matter who it is, just an adult that you feel like you can trust. This way older adults can be looking out for you. Even though he is in a gang, adults are more powerful and can protect you from them. The best people to tell are your parents. They can take action and protect you at home as well. Whatever you do don't punch him in the face. That's how you really get in trouble, not only with him but also with the adults that should be helping you.|`|W4xJGKk2aa	tell the counselors, police or your parents for gods sake|`|uuHDQr1paa	Hire local thugs to urinate on his leg.

sI6m9uQfaa	Take your general education requirements at a community college and get all A's if you can. Then you can apply for scholarships.  If you take more then average credit hours per quarter/semester you should be able to finish in 4 years. Otherwise 5-5.5|`|oGthpoEsaa	Community college is definitely an option and even just going there your first year and transferring out to another school can still save you money. You probably could go to a state school though. Usually state schools over sizable grants to residents of their own states and tuition is much cheaper than private universities. Additionally the harder you work junior and senior year, the more financial aid you are usually offered.

I agree that it seems kind of ridiculous to ask that question of someone applying for a mechanic's position, but apparently the college wants to make sure that even the mechanics are PC.

Does you school have a mediation center? Or a guidance center that can schedule a mediation?? You do not want them to get into trouble, because that will make them madder, but if you can do mediation it may help.   If it doesnt then you need to purpsue criminal charges against them.

I am NOT joking.  High school girls are crazy and I understand how this can be a living hell for you.    - Go talk to your Vice Principle or whomever deals with punishment.  Choose the nicest person in the office to talk to.  They will understand if you tell them everything.    - Stop hanging out with the friends you have because they obviously suck.  Join some clubs or sports and find some normal people.  Usually, the people who look scary to hang out with (punks, drama kids, nerds) are the coolest.    - Tell your mom, she will listen if you explain it to her.    You have to go to school, it's really important, but it doesn't have to be so dramatic.  Find a new group of people to hang out with that aren't so judgmental and you'll be fine.

Just show a commitment to a language and get good grades in it, obviously. If you like Spanish take it! If you find Japanese interesting and different take it but get ready for the challenge of learning two new alphabets (and Chinese characters, Kanji), a different sentence structure, etc. To make it easier if you do decide to go the Japanese route, learn kana, the alphabets, on your own time. It'll make everything easier especially when you start memorizing Kanji.
83cMcFgxaa	Language changes all the time, but I highly doubt an article like 'the' is going anywhere anytime soon. British English has always used the phrase 'in hospital' (they all say it, ask someone from the UK); it's not a new thing. The FBI example sounds like it's from journalism, they often bend the 'rules' a bit anyway for spacial reasons, or there could be some kind of convention with acronyms, who knows. Regardless, I don't think 'a', 'an' or 'the' are falling to the wayside. We may stop using them in some situations, but it would probably take several hundred years for them to disappear altogether, if they ever do.|`|49c07573b2ef8b7f4c512a10de7d7febaa	I don't often see it omitted from American English.
