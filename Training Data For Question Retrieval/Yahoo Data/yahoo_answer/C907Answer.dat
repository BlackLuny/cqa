But some new laws to protect tenants, check out your state LL/Tenant.|`|zr4gsEXjaa	I think the bank have to honor the lease under law. Make sure you don't pay any thing to the old landlord.|`|efdb04ba6a4a066db7fc97aeb97e9037aa	My advice is to begin looking for a new home soon.  I live in Northern VA and a lot of tenants have come home from work to find their belongings on the curbside.  This stemmed from the property being a foreclosure that resulted in an eviction by Sheriff deputies.  The bank could be sending all of the communications to the homeowner at another address.  I would not rely upon a stressed homeowner to remember my interests.  In the meanwhile you might be able to talk to the bank and determine your standing.  However the bank may not speak with you because the loan is not in your name.  As far as the bank is concerned, your rental contract could be a 3rd party agreement that has nothing to do with them.  Additionally I would talk to an attorney about whether or not you are legally responsible for a lease that is based upon a foreclosed property.  This is a big problem in this area because of the volume of investment properties.  I am sorry this happened and best wishes.

Initially there are like $20 worth of surveys you can do right away, but I checked it constantly for months and new surveys never appeared meaning the only other way to earn money toward your $75 minimum for payout is to get referrals.

Do it until they say something like "The position is filled" or "You're out of the running." <br>  <br>  And i hear people tell you all the time to send a thank-you letter after the interview. NOT!

There was strong data out showing that china has increased manufacturing production and is willing to spend on health care reforms as well as a huge stimulus package. There is a good chance that the worst is over but do not believe for one minute that it has anything to do with anything that Obama and his joke of a FED have put together.

SZQC7Sfjaa	I think all of those are great ideas! I am 14 and I am also trying to brainstorm some ideas to make money over the summer. I babysit frequently, and it is an awesome way to make money. It is normally fairly easy, and most everyone pays generously. Also, if the people like you, they will suggest that their friends use you, and that works out great for building up numerous families to work for. <br>  <br>  Pet Sitting/ Dog Walking is also really good because, for example, during the summer if the parents are at work and the kids are at camp...who is going to walk the dog? Another great thing that falls under this category is taking care of pets/plants/household items while a family is away or out of town. <br>  <br>  None of that is child labor, unless you were employed by someone.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped!<br>  You also helped me and gave me some useful ides!<br>  <br>  Tip: Put up fliers!|`|v1iSZlRAaa	I work online at Cashcrate.

Soft inquiries are when you pull your own credit reports or when companies you already do business with pull your reports.

Hard inquiries are when you and you alone apply for credit and those stay on your report for 2 years and affect your score for 1year. These kind of inquiries are visible to you and anyone who pulls your credit report, and are the kind you want to avoid whenever possible.|`|OrhkqVR5aa	Dispute it!  Write to the credit agency who reported these inquiries. you can even do this online. Tell them the company was not authorized to inquire on you.

But by disputing them, it should stop these inquiries from counting against you credit score.|`|bfe4ad38e28ddda61b321173866c1f9aaa	Take a deep breath, if the inquires are soft, which most of them are, they do not effect your credit score.

Since these are for preapproval offers in the future they are soft inquires so who cares they don't effect your credit record at all.

f6y3pM4oaa	Cutting jobs during bad economic situations is very common and usually one of the first steps for small-medium sized companies as a means to cut down expenses. Myself a business owner with 12 full time employees had to laid off 3 employees due to decrease on sales that have dramatically impacted my company. cutting employees will help decrease companies cost, just make the calculation an average person with a salary of $35,000 a year and the owner decides to lay off 10 people it adds up to $350,000 on savings a year which is a lot. Companies can use that money to re-pay debts and/or expand their businesses or invest money in the adaptation of the recession. Indeed, companies try to cut down costs in order to offer more incentives to customers and therefore trying to increase sales.|`|LEQwnaruaa	I think it really matters, if you are a company wihch has it empolyee's mainly in unionized work then cutting will happen often. But for a normal company which is not only seeing their decline but exspect themselves to be stuck at this level for a period of time, will definatly cut jobs to maintain the company. <br>  <br>  There will always be a golden balance between business and employees, satisfying it either leads to job cuts or employment, it is all very variable.|`|CgyhTJzOaa	Your first reason is very accurate. Companies need to pay taxes based on employees, as well as land and other structural expenses, and income based on the entire company as a whole. A company may also have to lay off workers to pay off loans that were borrowed from banks (and such) to keep the business on its feet. They must pay back the loans, which is the problem with the American Economy at the moment.<br>  <br>  A good decision would definitely be based off of money.<br>  A bad decision would be the receiving party, having their valuable employees cut short, having to file more paperwork, and thus creating more stress upon the company.

I have done this type of job you 10 years and it can be brain destroying, if you don't reach your targets you will be told you wont have a job, ideally this type of call centre would be suitable for young females that spend a lot of money on designer clothes - I am well past that age group.

As far as rates, if you find a better rate of return on principal, why not just put it all in that bank.|`|aCDWwsisaa	If you are "not confident in the FDIC" (which is the LEAST 'risky' entity in banking) then your money should be in a cardboard box under your bunk bed...in your log cabin...next to Ted Kazinski's!|`|AA10259042	The FDIC is somewhat of a concern.  I think maybe it is out of money or nearly so if not already.  The government thinks Bank of America is too big to fail so they will keep pumping money into it until the likely hood of the government failing becomes a pressing concern.  At that point all bets are off.  <br>  <br>  As strange as it may sound foreign currencies are doing even worse than the U S $.

(Look how much effort and money they're putting into keeping AIG and Citigroup alive- all just to keep up confidence in our financial system.  I think given that evidence, there's no way they would let the FDIC fail!)<br>  <br>  However, what you may consider is looking at credit unions.  (I am no fan of credit unions because of their unfair competitive advantages created by unequal taxation rules, but that's another story).<br>  <br>  Anyway, credit unions are generally insured by the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund (NCUSIF) that is administered by the NCUA, an agency of the federal government that is similar to the FDIC.  Since credit unions are much smaller than some of the big banks that are currently believed to be in trouble, I think their exposure to losses is much less than the FDIC.<br>  <br>  PS- I would steer way clear of most foreign currencies right now.  Investors around the world are DUMPING their own currencies and fleeing to the safety of the US dollar.  I would follow their lead- at least for now.<br>  <br>  PPS to Robert below:  Not a single Lehman client lost money due to Lehman's bankruptcy (unless they owned Lehman stock or bonds.)  Those clients can still call the same brokers and place trades or withdraw money.  Only the parent holding company filed bankruptcy- not the individual divisions.|`|9Yckp4ywaa	Your $ is safe thanks to FDIC, assuming the $ is below the threshold.   The only issue with CD's is that if the bank does go under it can take some time for you to get access to the $.  (not always but happened in the S&L crisis).  I'd just be sure you have cash at 3-4 institutions, enough to get by if your really concerned.

You could request a hearing, but it maybe better for you to file for bankruptcy to afford to pay these loans back and to cut your lifestyle to afford these loans.|`|5BTKscZraa	As you probably know, there nothing worse than student loan debt....As a debtor you have none of the legal rights that regular creditors do as with credit card debt. <br>  <br>  Just do your best to keep the loans current and out of default...see site below about this issue.  If the situation becomes horrible and out of control, then Chapter 13 bankruptcy (the version where you pay back debts under a court supervised repayment plan) may provide help.

In addition your school should be able to provide you with job resources or career planning. If not, then perhaps you are attending the wrong school and wasting your money. <br>  <br>  Nursing programs are so popular that the aren't particularly known for being "flexible" in terms of scheduling. This is why it takes 3 years to finishing a "two" year nursing degree. Classes aren't always offered and the list of prereqs are ridiculous. Better and cheaper to go for a four year BSN degree (which will yield more earning potential over a life time than a ASN, which has limited earning potential), rather than doing CNA than ASN, which will end up costing you more money out of pocket than a four year nursing school.

xreWOKBYaa	Someone who gets foreclosed on can not afford to pay for mortgage. Most people don't buy homes if they know they can not afford them, many people's jobs have been laid off or have reduced their income leaving them unable to pay the mortgage they already had. The bank runs off of money, not sympathy, that is why they do not give people more time to pay. The bank sells the home for as much as they can get on it - which in today's economy is not much. Many people are being foreclosed on because they can not afford their homes.<br>  <br>  EDIT: You are assuming people buy homes they can not afford, I owned my home for almost 20 years and I got foreclosed on. Nobody buys a home that they can not afford - that would be stupid.|`|O8qdCBzLaa	People looked at buying and refinancing property as a kind of ATM machine that would never run out of cash. They were even encouraged by mortgage brokers and lenders to play this game. However, this only works when home prices are appreciating at a rapid rate. And, it all comes crashing down when prices stop going up and start to fall.<br>  <br>  When a loan company gives a person a mortgage loan, they usually end up selling that loan to a financial institution that invests in mortgages. And, there are also companies called mortgage brokers who work with the borrower and lender to set up the loan. So, you may have mortgage broker A working with lender B, who sells the mortgage to investor C.<br>  <br>  Mortgage broker A and lender B really don't care whether the borrower has the ability to actually pay off the loan. Broker A gets his commission when the loan funds and lender B makes a profit by selling the mortgage as an investment security. The only one who really cares whether the borrower pays of the loan is investor C.<br>  <br>  So, you had all these unscrupulous brokers and lenders who would offer loans to people at very low "teaser" interest rates for the first 3 to 5 years, which would adjust up to more realistic levels that were nearly double the teaser rate. And, people who could just afford the payments with the teaser rate went ahead and bought homes, assuming that the price of the home would keep rising at 20% a year. Then, when the interest rate adjusted up to where they couldn't afford it, they would refinance and start over at the low teaser rate, taking out cash from the increased equity in the property.<br>  <br>  But, the prices of real estate stopped rising, mostly because the rising prices were artificially inflated by speculative investors (there was a real estate bubble). When this happened, people stopped buying houses. And, the excessive inventory of houses on the market caused prices to go down.<br>  <br>  When prices went down, the people with the adjustable rate mortgages (ARMs) had their rates adjust up and it caused their payments to double (they were now paying almost twice as much interest). And, they couldn't afford to make the payments. So, they stopped making payments and the banks foreclosed on their houses. <br>  <br>  The bank has their money tied up in the property and they want to get their money back, so they can re-invest it or pay off other obligations. So, that's why they foreclose right away instead of giving the borrower more time to pay the debts.<br>  <br>  And, those foreclosure properties you see for hundreds of dollars are usually properties in very undesirable areas (like the east side of Detroit) or are somehow damaged such that they would cost more to repair than the property would be worth with the repairs completed. So, people abandon them and the couple hundred dollars pays the back property taxes owed on the property. But, the property itself is worthless.|`|GnpaF5TWaa	1|`|718c777b5d1a38da9a05b9d6a9f5c738aa	I'll give you an example:<br>  <br>  My husband and I had a hefty savings account and bought our first house.  We then had two children in two years and I was working and he was working for a very well know company for 5 years when out of no where they just laid off numerous people including him.  Well, we couldn't just take the kids out of daycare (if he had gotten another job we would have needed to find another daycare) so he looked for 6 months, while we paid $1200/month in daycare, and I tried to pay all the bills.  He went on 3 interviews a week and we had finally blown all of our savings and taken out a second mortgage and finally had to move on with a foreclosure.  <br>  <br>  Others get into balloon loans and disaster strikes where they are owing the entire mortgage in the last bill.  Because they are paying interest only throughout the 30-year mortgage and most of them are retired by the time the last payment of $100K comes around.  Honestly, banks really screwed people and no on taught people my age how to manage money!|`|800b0874823e869f861f3f446edd7438aa	The reasons there are so many foreclosures is mainly because homeowners borrowed more money than they could really afford.  Partly this is because of shady practices of mortgage lenders not properly informing their clients about balloon payments and other things.  It is also true that the majority of Americans live paycheck to paycheck with very little savings.  As for buying foreclosures, banks do sell foreclosed homes for less than their total value, but rarely for less than the amount of money owed against them.  I.e. the house may be worth $200,000 but the bank will sell it for $20,000 because that is all that is owed against it.  When you hear about buying a foreclosure for $100, $300, or $500, it is actually referring to a process called pre-foreclosure.  This process involves convincing a homeowner to allow you to take over their debt (and the property) before the foreclosure process is complete.  In this process you must make the debt current, meaning if the homeowner is only $100 behind in his payments then that is all you need to pay (plus bank fees, etc.).  The benefit to the homeowner is that they don't have a foreclosure on their record, but that's about it.  Now that you own the property, you are responsible for the rest of the debt, so it always recommended that you sell you the house as soon as possible.  You make money by selling the house for more money than what is owed against it.  It is possible to purchase a pre-foreclosure cheap, but it requires you convincing the homeowner to step out of the house with nothing.|`|BOOLN0O8aa	A) Lots of people live paycheck to paycheck. That means they spend it on bills as soon as they get it. It's what people mean when they say they "can't get ahead."<br>  <br>  B) For the past few years mortgage lenders have been lending money for home irresponsibly. They've been allowing people to purchase homes they could not reasonably afford by setting them up with Adjustable Rate Mortgages. That means that at the time of the loan, the interest rate was low and therefore the monthly payment was low and the person could afford it. But then the interest rates went up, people's mortgage payments doubled and they could no longer afford the payment - even if they had a job.|`|a2NW1lSkaa	That is because ...<br>  they borrowed a lot of money from the bank<br>  Then they can't pay off the mortgage and the bank takes over the house<br>  When the bank is unable to sell it, the house is recognized as foreclosed<br>  Taxes are going up and people have less money in their accounts than before, therefore, increasing the amount of foreclosures in the USA

People took out too much loan for what they actually make. <br>  2) You are right by saying that the problem started with housing so the solution must also be in housing.  The problem with housing was that prices got out of control and priced responsible people out of the market.

a78860b2cdf2c89664191c16471d2353aa	Normally, it is best to file joint return. But if your spouse owes back taxes, your joint refund will be offset. To get your portion of joint refund, you can file Form 8379 (Injured Spouse) with your joint tax return. The IRS will allocate the refund between you and your spouse. But by filing Form 8379, your refund will be delayed by about 2 months. <br>  <br>  You can file as married filing jointly (MFJ) or married filing separately. In most cases, it is better to file as MFJ. If you file MFS, you will not get many credits and deductions.Read  <a href="http://taxipay.blogspot.com/2008/02/filing-status-for-married.html" rel="nofollow">http://taxipay.blogspot.com/2008/02/fili...</a>|`|NwkZ5OmCaa	If you file a joint return and if it shows a refund, the refund can and will be offset for his student loan.  This is a good thing because it reduces the student loan bill.<br>  <br>  Some spouses do not want "their share" of the refund to go to the debt, so they either file MFS or file MFJ with form 8379.  The IRS allocates the refund and if any is allocated to the spouse who doesn't owe the debt, they get it back instead of having it go to the debt.  The allocation process adds 6-8 weeks to the processing time.|`|AA10469473	An injured spouse form is used by a person filing a joint return with a spouse who owes back government debt, defaulted student loans or back child support.  It prevents the spouse's refund from being taken along with their spouse's to pay back this debt.  If you file the form, then only his portion of the refund would be taken.<br>  <br>  But if you filed joint returns for the years where he owes back taxes, then you are jointly responsible for those, so the injured spouse form wouldn't let you off the hook for those.  But your portion of the refund wouldn't be taken to pay toward his student loans, or toward back taxes that weren't on a joint return.
7HKTDcvYaa	AIG could have long term value if the things it insures are not claiming their cash flow. In particular many insurance companies have been selling insurance on default of mortgages, and AIG has lost big on that bet.<br>  <br>  Will AIG lose an infinite amount of money on those policies? No. But they will still lose money on them. They will lose shareholder money, supplied by government.<br>  <br>  Government is largely on the hook for that money. If it does not come from AIG, going to the mortgage lenders, largely it will come from government backed FDIC guarantees for failing banks. So government money buys a stake in AIG to pay on those policies so the government does not have to pay the same money through FDIC when the banks fail.<br>  <br>  After it is all over government owns 36 percent of a much drained AIG. But that AIG can go back to making money, and avoid making such rash decisions. Well, no.

They wouldn't tell her if his tax refund would be intercepted, however, they did tell her that he had to be over $1000 in arrears before they would issue an offset request to the IRS, and they also told her that his state tax would not get offset even if the federal was.  Also, when she finally did get his offset ( as he was over the 1000) it was the end of Nov.  So if your ex has already gotten his fed for 2008 (in 2009) chances are you will not be getting it this yr.  good luck.

a15VNzUaaa	Well, I understand your feeling, and up until today it certainly seemed that way! We have been eagerly awaiting the details on the foreclosure fix promised by the Treasury Department. <br>  <br>  Today the details for their loan modification plan were announced, and it looks pretty good for people who've been doing the right thing all along. The plan puts $75 billion toward helping 9 million homeowners.<br>  <br>  The great news is that homeowners don't have to be in default to qualify. They only have to show that they are AT RISK of defaulting, And this would include homeowners who are facing an interest rate hike. <br>  <br>  To be eligible, homeowners must live in the property, have originated their mortgage before January 1, 2009, show proof of their income, and have a loan amount for less than $759,500. If the homeowner applying for a loan modification has a loan debt that equals more than 55% of their current income, they must also receive financial counseling. <br>  <br>  It sounds like, from the details you've provided, your son may qualify for a loan modification under these guidelines. <br>  <br>  The plan will be in effect until December 2012. Homeowners will only be allowed one loan modification in that time period under the plan. <br>  <br>  In the statement the government released today, homeowners who believe they may qualify for a modification were encouraged to call the servicer of their mortgage (the bank that holds their loan), and intitate the modification process.<br>  <br>  This is really good news for struggling homeowners across the country. The hope is that the plan will keep more people in their homes and stem the tide of forclosures affecting so many Americans right now.<br>  <br>  The Treasury has also promised a second part to this plan, and have said they will release details soon. The  second part  will help people who haven't missed any payments and have little or no equity in their homes. Stay tuned!|`|dGvKF19kaa	I can definitely relate. I'm a little peeved that all of these people that are in default are going to end up with lower mortgage rates than I have. I have never missed or been late with a payment, I have no credit card debt, however I do have medical debt from my college days when I was uninsured, so I do not think I will qualify for much lower rates than I have now. I am working on repairing my credit by paying down my medical debt, but those won't come off of my report for a few more years. I find it sickening that people that have let themselves fall behind in their payments will be better off than the responsible home owners.<br>  <br>  If I were your son, I would speak to the bank and explain to them his difficulty. I did read last week a little more encouraging news about the housing bailouts. The article in my local paper state that the banks would get a certain amount from the government to renegotiate with borrowers in default. They would get a slightly higher amount from the government by renegotiating with people like me who have not been behind on their payments. That gives me a little bit of hope that I will be able to talk to Wells Fargo (my mortgage company) about the terms of my loan. I don't like handouts for people either, but if the banks are going to get money from the government anyway, I think that we should all get something out of the deal. After all, as taxpayers, we're the ones paying for it!<br>  <br>  Good luck to your son and all other homeowners out there.|`|AA11206283	Not good enough; but you have to start somewhere, and starting with the people who are in default and aren't making it seems to make the most sense.|`|AA11173563	his only hope to refi this note is if it is FHA or VA loan as he can streamline with out an appraisal and they will use the old value that he had years ago.

He made is own bed and now he needs to sleep in it.  If home prices were still going up at unrealistic rates, you would not be on here giving us a sob story.

Yes I would do it, but wouldn't like it.  But with a man I would do nothing sexual for any amount of money (YUCK)!  I would do crazy stunts for money long as I don't risk bodily injury.  But being humiliated, running through the mall naked, dressing up like a chicken, having someone ride me like a horse in public, or any other thing you can think of for BIG bucks that doesn't fall under the catagories listed above.

SeotOjr8aa	Code 1121 really just means p-freeze. They found something on your return that trigger some type of mistake or alarm, and someone has to manually look at your return instead of the computer that they use. So they have to make sure eveything is on the up and up. It could be anything that could have of triggered it.  So right before your suppose to get your refund. They freeze it. The same thing happened to me. For a whole week WRM said my refund was deposited on 2/6. The first 2 irs rep told me it was deposited to speak to my bank. My bank knew absolulety nothing. By the 11th, I go back to WRM and this time it's saying " Delay in Processing..blah..blah.., So I call IRS rep again and they tell me that I have to wait for cp05 notice, (which took about 3 weeks to come) and to do what the notice says. Lucky be me, I received the notice last week and it says to do nothing. That if you don't hear from them withing 3 weeks of the notice to call. It's basically a waiting game, once you get code 1121. It's up to them to decide whether they are going to give you the money or not. So be ready for a long wait. It's 3/4/09 and im still waiting for mines. I filed 1/26. I still have 2 more weeks before I can call back and wait and see if they think I deserve my money....Good luck.....Once again..Welcome to the code 1121 group....|`|oqvYnHuyaa	OK, I was supposed to get DD on 1/30. Didn't happen. The following week I got 1121. So it has been 5-6 weeks and today I changed to 1201.

So hopefully it won't be too long but I still have no idea when I will get my refund so good luck!!! Also, do not waste your time calling the IRS, they have no idea what the hell they are doing...
ed1f0410c6d854ef3f963ebeefee3ceeaa	Yes, this is good time and at a good price, but you should hold it for at least 2 weeks.

Then if there is any debt or anything it will be taken from the estate. hopefully this never happens but talk to an attorney who specializes in wills and trusts and whatnot.|`|7HKTDcvYaa	You have mentioned the sole remedy to avoid the debt. Debt that is attached to an asset stays with that asset no matter who owns it. So, if you decline to accept a bequest, you have no obligation to the owner of that debt.<br>  <br>  If you do accept the bequest, and let the business fail, go bankrupt, the creditors have a right to pick up the pieces for salvage. A business can go bankrupt without its owner going bankrupt if, and only if, the business is incorporated.<br>  <br>  So one has to decline to accept an unincorporated business that is about to fail.|`|qBCGH52haa	If the handoff is done incorrectly, there could be problems.  However, if the business is part of the estate and there are debts, the estate must satisfy the debts before any assets can be transferred to the heir.

qgr6Q4qbaa	Hi Lulu.  When you say Maternity Benefit, I'll assume you mean Maternity Allowance?   :o)<br>  <br>  It sounds as if your employer is messing up your payslips!  The problem will be if they don't put their records right before the end of the tax year (5 April 2009), because when they produce your form P60 'End of Year Certificate' it might show the wrong figure for Gross Pay.  It is important your P60 shows the correct information because you need to use it to complete your Tax Credit forms, and also because that will be the figure they tell HM Revenue & Customs (tax office) that you earned!<br>  <br>  I don't think they are claiming anything themselves, I think they are just making mistakes with their payroll records.<br>  <br>  You need to speak to them about this if you haven't already.  Point out that you think your recent payslips show the wrong Gross Pay figure, & you are concerned that your P60 will be wrong.  Ask them to put it right & let you know.  If THEY need any help or advise they can contact HMRC Employer's Helpline 08457 143 143 (source:  <a href="http://search2.hmrc.gov.uk/kbroker/hmrc/contactus/search.ladv?sr=0&as=1&cs=ISO-8859-1&sc=hmrc&sf=&sm=0&nh=50&ha=34&tx0=370316&fl0=__dsid:&tx1=2038&raction=view)" rel="nofollow">http://search2.hmrc.gov.uk/kbroker/hmrc/...</a><br>  <br>  Keep your payslips safe & a record of what you actually got!  When you get your P60 from your employer, check the Gross Pay figure is correct.  If the P60 is wrong, you should write to your tax office.  Send the P60 & payslips with a letter explaining what gross pay you actually had from them & when (ie you didn't have anything from them since ....).  Say you asked them to sort it out but your P60 is still wrong.  The tax office will then look into it & sort it out for you.  Your employer should give you your P60 by 31st May 2009.<br>  <br>  If you don't know the address for your tax office you can find it on the HMRC website <a href="http://search3.openobjects.com/kbroker/hmrc/locator/locator.jsp?type=1" rel="nofollow">http://search3.openobjects.com/kbroker/h...</a>  you will need to use the Employer/PAYE reference which will be on your P60 (maybe also your payslips).<br>  <br>  When you complete your tax credit forms - just use the correct figure of pay - not the incorrect one on the P60.<br>  <br>  Someone else has said that maternity pay is taxable & effects your future tax credit, they are WRONG in your case - I think they are talking about Statutory Maternity Pay.  Maternity Allowance is NOT taxable (source <a href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/incometax/taxable-income.htm)" rel="nofollow">http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/incometax/taxable...</a> and you do NOT include it as income on your tax credit form (source <a href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/forms/tc600-notes.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/forms/tc600-notes...</a> or call tax credit helpline for confirmation).<br>  <br>  Sorry it's long - but I hope it helps.|`|bdc81a350221a05348d3b5708b5daa86aa	contact the tax office and ask them but maternity pay is classed as taxable income and does affect and future child tax credit - your tax credit depends on what you earned that past 2 years|`|ZcK7YCWNaa	They shouldn't be preparing you a wage slip each month, I would contact  your pay department and ask them why they are doing it, I would also ring your local tax office were you applied for your maternity benefit and ask them to help, unfortunately this could get your employer into trouble.|`|06a1831b0b8ffd82f1a1af8d01d8f301aa	<a href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk" rel="nofollow">http://www.hmrc.gov.uk</a><br>  Their advise line is very good.
1CVOHoapaa	Don't even think of it!! pubs are closing at the rate of 40 per week. 2000 have closed since  the last budget. The expense of setting up your own place is prohibitive. Buying a tenancy/lease means huge rents and paying over the odds as you are tied in to buy from the pubco.<br>  Profits are down due to the recession. Customers can buy lager at 25p a can or less from the supermarkets so why pay over ￡3.00 from you. Those that come in will 'pre load' with drink before coming tp your place which means you get to look after them while they are drunk without getting any benefit from selling them the drink.<br>  <br>  Utility bills are enormous, (mine trebled in a 2 year period. Gas from ￡150 PM to ￡500 elec from 200 to 600!!)<br>  <br>  Restaurants are more profitable but bring thier own problems etc etc etc. <br>  <br>  A couple of hundred quid for a personal and premises licence is nothing. It's everything else that will do for you!!<br>  <br>  If you aren't scared yet then think again! (it may look glamourous but it sure aint that)|`|zuGKIWfNaa	That depends on WHERE.

They will not pay rent for on time because they needed to buy their kids a drum.|`|d1431527582f8f414e0e05855712ef5faa	Renting can be a good income stream, however there are many caveats. First - either have a management company handle the property for you or  make sure to do a background check and financial check on any candidate to rent.  If you do this on your own, make sure you know what you are getting into. Do your homework. Understand what it is really like to be a landlord.  If you have a hard time detaching your personal feelings from this unit being home, then don't rent it out. No one will take as good of care of it as you would. And when you rent you take the chance of having someone who doesn't have good housekeeping skills.  <br>  <br>  Any rent money is considered income, so you will have to declare it.  What you might consider is talking with a tax adviser or accountant first to see what program would be best for you to consider.<br>  <br>  I have no way of knowing where you are  or this unit, but if your area is anything like ours, it may not be such a good time to sell. <br>  <br>  Hope that helps

Most states do NOT, and those which do have such a proviso generally have a prescribed number of steps you must take before you 'fix and deduct'.<br>  <br>  You can nicely ASK if they would agree to your 'fix and deduct'.  If they agree, get it in writing before proceeding.  If they won't allow it, your only option is to regularly and courteously bug them about the issues.<br>  <br>  Always remember that honey attracts far more bees than does vinegar.  Follow the correct approach.|`|HeFlBmGSaa	I would do what the other poster suggested and get the things done yourself and deduct that with your rent payment and submit receipts to them. I would make sure to document this ahead of time by sending out a certified letter to the landlord stating that they have ignored your requests to fix the items and that you will be getting the things fixed on your own and deduct that from the rent.<br>  <br>  Courts typically are on the tenants side if you are organized and have everything well documented.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|12VQ4ETcaa	Laws on this vary from state to state.  The link below talks about something called "repair and deduct," which means you tell the landlord you're getting it fixed yourself and then you deduct the cost from your rent.  Example: your rent is $800, you get something fixed that costs $50, you send them $750 and a receipt for the $50 repair.  You will want to find out the law on repair and deduct for your state before you do this, though.

You would have to have your parents there to sign the check over to them to cash it. (i know thats not an option.) another thing you could do it have a friends with a good account somewhere cash it for you. you have to go in with them but since it is a small amount it should be fine. You will sign it over to your friend and they will cash it and give you the money. Also find out how old you have to be at your bank to open your own account, or a savings account.

Mi2w3lvEaa	Anything is possible if you are willing to pay enough.<br>  <br>  I don't believe there is a universal service that you can register with online that would work in every country and in every circumstance.  It sounds to me like an awful business model unless the volume was significant.  This middleman would have to make a purchase, pack and ship it, comply with export and import restrictions, track the package and be able to guarantee against any problems AND do it for a small markup or face significant price resistance.   I'd say your best bet would be to cajole the non-exporting company into making an exception or find someone -- perhaps through a personal connection -- to do this for you.  <br>  <br>  It is possible you might locate a concierge type service willing to try as a one-off but again the hassle for this middleman strikes me as too great to make it a sustainable business.

Since your in school, you'll want a job that is used to hiring teenagers and has flexible hours, such as any fast food restaurant. My first job was at McDonalds, and it wasn't as bad as everyone made it out to be. Besides, a job when you're in high school is in no way the job you'll have once you graduated.<br>  If you're completely set on not applying at a fast food restaurant, try a regular restaurant as a waitress, hostess or busgirl. Other food type industries: hospital cafeterias (usually pay more because it's considered a high risk environment), retirement homes...<br>  <br>  If you don't want to have anything to do with the food services, apply at places for desk work, such as hotels, hospitals (as an aide angel), large store brands (wal*mart, target, home depot, menards, shopko, kohls...)<br>  <br>  If anything, apply at a near by mall.<br>  <br>  Just remember, the more job applications you put out there, there bigger the chance of getting a job. If you're dreading getting applications and filling them out, set aside a whole day to do it, instead of doing it here and there.

BoAEgaAGaa	The stimulus issued last year could have been for as much as $600.  If you are required to file a 2008 income tax return there is a possibility that you could receive a portion of the additional $300.  This will all depend on your total income and tax liability.<br>  <br>  As part of ARRA, a one-time payment of $250 will be available to retirees and disabled individuals receiving certain Social Security, Supplemental Security Income, Railroad Retirement benefits, and veterans' benefits. This check will automatically be paid to the appropriate individuals by the government. Retired government workers who do not receive Social Security benefits will be eligible to claim a $250 tax credit on their 2009 tax return. <br>  <br>  Therefore, you do not have to apply for this payment, it will be issued to you the same way you are receiving your social security at this time.

NrvrH4zQaa	If you are going to have a self-directed IRA, then Scottrade is fine.  Self-directed is when you decide which stocks to buy, rather than go through a mutual fund.  If this is the first IRA investment you have made or are making, then it may be better to start with a mutual fund (T Rowe Price or Vanguard) and contribute to that one fund until it's $10k or so, then diversify.  You can buy mutual funds through a Scottrade account, but there may be additional fees.<br>  <br>  You must have two different accounts if one is taxable (trading) and one is an IRA (Roth or traditional).  They can both be with one broker (Scottrade in your case) or two different brokers.  I have a taxable account with Scottrade, Roth and IRA accounts at E*Trade, and my wife's Roth and IRA are at T Rowe Price.|`|YL8R3Jubaa	Yes, consolidation of brokerage accounts is a good practice as long as you are with a good company.

ef12724ec9f7c914cfd8e486e0c5bbd3aa	It is entirely possible for someone else to use your credit, this is what identity theft is about. This doesn't mean you parents purposely used you to get a mortgage though, the credit agencies and financial institutions screw this up more often then they ever admit too.  <br>  <br>  You must get this fixed (it will not fix itself and will only grow into a bigger problem, see my experience below).  Try calling the Credit Bureaus, eventually you should get through the automated system and be able to talk to a real person.  You must talk with a real person, do not accept automated attendants, try pressing zero when it's not an option (it worked for me 5 years ago :) or Google the best way to contact each agency<br>  <br>  When I was 9 (NINE!) I had an child's savings account with the bank my parents mortgage was at.  The bank misfiled refinancing paperwork with my name on it (my name is similar to my mothers) and for a weeks time I owed my mothers mortgage.<br>  <br>  That is not the end of the story though.  When I was in my early twenties I tried running my credit report and could not get it.  I had the exact same issue with it asking for information on accounts I was not aware of (at the time I had a grand total of 1 credit card and 1 student loan).  From the questions being asked I could tell it was asking about things for my mom so I called her and got the information and was eventually able to get into 1 of the agencies online report.  Turns out my mother was considered an alias for me (we think because of the initial confusion when I was nine but I'm still not sure what happened).  I had 12 years of credit history showing up on my report, along with two Social Security numbers, numerous address, phone numbers and places of employment.  <br>  <br>  If my mom was at all reliable with credit, this would have been in my favor.  Alas, that was not the case.<br>  <br>  It took me several months to get my mother scrubbed from my reports.  It took so long partially because I did not want to file an identity theft claim against her (if you don't mind doing that to your parents, your process may be quicker then mine).  I had to talk to a real human at each agency who usually sent me a form to fill out and send back with some other proof of identification.  The Credit Bureaus will not fix identity/profile issues online or over the phone.  The best that they will do is accept forms back via fax (and not all of them agreed to that).<br>  <br>  Even after I got things all straightened out, two years later a new credit card showed up on my account.  My mom opened a store card and they asked here to swipe another card for ID.  She used one of the cards that were originally on my credit report (but which I know were showing up on hers as I insisting on seeing her report when I was getting everything straightened out).  Somehow this was still tied to my credit report (so my mom got a card she shouldn't have, again!).  Dispute process for this was quick and worked online.|`|7B9a65xaaa	yeah, but they are breaking the law if they do it. Your identity is yours and yours alone.

uFOO6Cryaa	borrow money against a CD...open a couple of small credit cards and may them monthly....|`|qBCGH52haa	Since you are now starting to build your credit history, start slow and low - use your new credit card for small purchases that you would normally pay cash for.  Take the cash and put it away.  When the bill comes, pay the bill with that cash immediately.  Do this for a few months (try to make purchases each month and pay the balance each month - do not let the balance accumulate).<br>  <br>  After a few months, say 6 to 9, apply for another card - preferably one that is issued by a store you normally shop at.  When you get it, do the same thing.  After a few months of buying and paying off, start alternating your card use, one month one card, the next month the other card.  This will keep the cards active and open (you do not want them closed, since one of the things on your credit score is your available credit ratio - the higher that ratio the better and a closed account automatically lowers the ratio).  <br>  <br>  Try not to get many inquiries on your credit report - too many looks like you are applying for lots of credit and they assume that you will run up bills and get overextended.<br>  <br>  The most important thing you can do is pay your bills on time, pay them off, and not get into debt (your debt to income ratio also affects your score and whether you can qualify for a mortgage).<br>  <br>  As with anything else, playing with credit can backfire, so be careful and use common sense.<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  <br>  Contrary to above, utilities and phone companies do not report payment history to the credit reporting agencies (unless you go into collections).|`|PnPVoakoaa	pay your bills on time!!!<br>  <br>  do you have utility bills?  phone bill?

Since you'd be a first-time homebuyer, there are many incentives available - you just need to find them.|`|AA11553579	1) Use the credit card, but only to by items you already have cash for.<br>  <br>  2) Keep track of EVERYTHING you spend on the card.<br>  <br>  3) NEVER let your balance exceed 30% of your credit limit, ideally 10% but that my be unrealistic if you limit is something like $200.<br>  <br>  4) Don't pay the full amount every month.  Let some of the balance ride month to month.  However, always have money on hand to pay it off in full.  Don't get into the habit of spending money you don't have.<br>  <br>  5) Never close a credit account, just stop using it.  How long you've had credit is important.  Hopefully your first card has no annual fee?  If no, use it for a few months and apply for a no annual fee card.

wcOq60Hhaa	Not necessarily.<br>  Yes, most of the time.<br>  No -- although I'm not sure I really understand what you are saying in question #3.<br>  <br>  Your second thought/question nails the principle issue squarely on the head.  The difference between active fund managers and index funds in a down market (people don't ask these questions when everything is going up) is that "holding on" to an active fund only makes sense if the manager continues to hold the same stocks in his fund and they rarely do.  <br>  <br>  The finance 401 "math" (that still stands after this disaster) says three things:  (1) Diversification only works if you stick with it.  If your risk level says you should be in 40% stocks, then you get the benefit of the projected return for that risk only if you stay 40% in the market all the time.  (2) Costs matter.  If manager 1 is charging 0.25% and manager 2 is charging 2%, manager 2 had better out perform manager 1 a lot  -- if he does not, he will dig a performance hole he can never get out of.  (3) Buying high and selling low will never put you ahead of the game.  This does not mean that you should never sell -- if your risk model is wrong, you should fix it.|`|7HKTDcvYaa	Many mutual funds fail to even match the performance of an index fund. Because of this some mutual funds have been investing in index funds for significant parts of their holdings.<br>  That way at least they come close to meeting the index.<br>  <br>  If you use a graph of your fund against an index, and see that it moves in step with the index fund, but just a bit lower, the manager is either buying index fund or replicating it within his fund. In that case you can be confident that the index fund will make you at least as much money.<br>  <br>  Some funds will make more money in a rising market than an index fund. some will lose less in a declining market. You can decide to go for the fund that works best in the trend of today, but don't forget to switch before the trend changes.<br>  Nobody ever does that, but hey, it is not part of portfolio balancing.<br>  <br>  If everyone invests through index funds, we should have a further  barrier to having investors give any guidance to our corporate bodies. Not that most investors do give any guidance.

yO5tm6e1aa	If you're going to be extremely wasteful, then rent a place where utilities are included.  If you're semi normal, then pay your own utilities.  If you live economically, pay your own utilities will save you a considerable amount of money.  The owner of the property looks at the average utility costs for a unit and then inflates it to compensate for excessive use.  They are not renting with utilities included to loose money.|`|2N6oTOLQaa	The only way to compare apples to apples is to literally compare each offer against your other options. Just add the estimated cost of utilities to the total rent to find the total living cost per month, and compare that to your other options.|`|O8qdCBzLaa	It depends on how much your rent is increased because the utilities are included. I doubt that a property owner would pay for their tenants' utilities each month and not collect enough rent to cover that expense. But, you can look at the rents people are asking for similar apartments without utilities included versus how much more it costs with utilities included. Then ask around how much peoples' typical utility bills are in apartments in your area and go with the apartment that makes better financial sense.<br>  <br>  One thing you might also consider, though, is that having the utilities included means no surprises with your utility bills. You will pay the same amount each month to the landlord, regardless of how much power you use each month. That might come in especially handy in the winter, when utility bills usually go up because of increased demand (more heating, lights must be on longer, etc.).|`|AA10091923	it depends on which utilities are included.<br>  <br>  Is it gas and electric, and cable (possibly internet connection)?<br>  <br>  Cable and internet can be pricey....so that would be a good deal...<br>  but if it is only gas and electric...it will depend on how much you use your electric and gas.  My bill usually runs around $22 a month...but I watch tv by candle light and do not use the oven much, and i keep my heat low (use blankets).  Other people I know will run their lights and heat and have $200 a month bills.....so it really depends on your usage and life style.<br>  <br>  great question...good luck  :)|`|evB63qWvaa	Well it depends on how much the rent is.  Provided that the rent would be the same, it is usually cheaper to go with utilities included if they don't charge a rediculous price for it, because then, you could run your air or heater as much as you want without having to sacrifice to save money.|`|9z1rTbmxaa	Utilities included.with the economy, you never know how expensive things like electricity and gas will get.Plus if you plan on staying together in the same apartment utilities included definetly

IRS is taking longer to process the tax return due to many fraudulent returns being filed.<br>  Be patient, your refund will be deposited as soon as IRS has processed your tax return<br>  Visit IRS website www.irs.gov "wheres my refund"  but only check once per week, if you check more than once per week you will start receiving different messages and codes.|`|VyrsDuyuaa	no, i got mine in a week|`|PN2CjFYcaa	You can have your return direct deposited.  Typically it takes about 2 weeks and the IRS only deposits on Fridays.  The IRS is taking longer to process returns this year because of the Rebate Recovery Credit and they are checking EIC (earned income credit) claims much more closely.  So, if you have either of these on your return, it may delay your refund.  You can go to www.irs.gov to check the status of your return.

I'm currently taking a money and banking course in college and we were discussing this in class.  My professor who is an avid investor and knows the market pretty well showed us a chart of the market history from when it opened to 2005.  In 1995 the market sky rocketed from about 8000 to the market high with no plateauing. He doesn't believe that it will get much worse but the market trend showed that when it dropped it went back to the most recent plateau but we broke it because it was at 8000 and obviously we went under 8000.  So he thinks it could possibly hit 4000 but doesn't think it will but doesn't want to rule it out.  So most people think we have hit our low but it can always go lower.

Another advantage (or disadvantage, depending on how you see it) is that pharmacy techs have a sort of monotonous job, pretty much the same thing day-in and day-out. Downside, is the fact that pharm techs aren't so in-demand because certification is easier to get than say a radiology technologist certification. In fact, some pharmacy techs are trained on-job. There's just too many of them around, unfortunately.<br>  <br>  I would go with radiologic technologist, for one, you get paid a hell of a lot more than a pharmacy tech. Radiology techs are way more in demand and there is more room for career advancement--options to go into MRI, CT, go back to school for sonography or radiation therapy. Hopefully my answer isn't too biased, I'm partial to radiography, myself, just because it's so interesting to me.<br>  <br>  Good luck with your decision!|`|xdZa8c6Caa	Looking for job??<br>  <a href="http://www.globaljobcenter.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.globaljobcenter.com</a>|`|t3CSfffOaa	Definately an Xray tech.

STYhiMEyaa	When you're thinking of starting any business, it helps to make a business plan.  It doesn't have to be a terribly formal document so long as it sets out what you're going to do, how much it will cost to do it, who you're going to do it for, how you'll find them and how much you'll make from doing it.  It's like using a map to get from A to B.<br>  <br>  There are some grants available but you usually have to put up at least 50% of the finance.  What would you need the grant for?  You must have all your tools as you're in the trade.  Do you have a van?  Sign-writing it is a good way of advertising yourself.  You can keep your stationery very simple so you don't need to spend a lot on it.  If you apply for funding, you will need a more formal business plan.<br>  <br>  You also need to set up a separate bank account for your business finances, get business insurance and let Inland Revenue know that you're in business.<br>  <br>  Assuming you're in the UK, contact your local Business Link for lots of free help and advice on starting up.  They can advise you of finance available and help with your business plan.<br>  <br>  The most important thing you need to do with your business is let people know that you're doing it.  Word of mouth is the best way.  Tell family and friends and ask them to recommend you.  Get a few satisfied cutomers and ask them to refer you to their friends and family.  If you do a professional job, you'll never be short of work.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|ZcK7YCWNaa	If your in the UK get in touch with your local business link they will be able to tell you everything that you need to know about getting started.

So do lots of research on that specific location. In general though i don't think you can get hurt buying right now.

I wouldn't wait till the end of the year - although it is nearly april, I would call them now and check it out because if you have had expenses paid and your tax code is the normal single persons tax code you will get a tax bill.

The chance of selling are close to zero, as it is not worth anything.|`|O8qdCBzLaa	If you want to sell it yourself, you can try this timeshare resale site: <a href="http://www.timeshareresales.com/." rel="nofollow">http://www.timeshareresales.com/.</a> They charge you $39 to put a listing on their site for up to a year. I also noticed that a lot of units for sale on this site have a real estate agent or broker as the contact person. So, you might be able to just go through a real estate office, like you would a house. You would have to pay commission, though.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind that the resale price is going to be a lot less than you paid for it from a resort, especially in this economy. About 5 years ago, I bought a timeshare in Maui (2BR/2BA, ocean front on the west side of the island) for about $11,000. The resort wanted over $25,000 if I were to buy it from them. But, I got it from a private party through this site: <a href="http://www.timesharestogo.com/." rel="nofollow">http://www.timesharestogo.com/.</a> <br>  <br>  This place doesn't charge you anything up front to list the timeshare for sale for 18 months. You just fill out a form and send it in. They then market your timeshare on a variety of websites they either own or have access to. When they receive a purchase offer within $25 of the listed purchase price, you then owe them a $1500 flat-rate fee. They do, however, complete the transaction to everyone's satisfaction and get their money from escrow when it closes. They just don't want someone to get an offer through them and have the deal fall through, only to have the seller contact the buyer privately later and bypass the timeshare place.<br>  <br>  It was kind of weird being in California, buying a timeshare in Hawaii, from a couple in Michigan, through an agency in Florida. I mean, if it was a scam or there was some kind of problem, which state laws applied?<br>  <br>  Anyway, it went off without a hitch. And, I would definitely recommend them to anyone looking to buy or sell a timeshare.|`|yh2hr3Vfaa	There is a bunch of them on E bay for $1 and take over payments.<br>  There is a glut of timeshares there allready. Maybe you will get lucky.|`|sby0C51haa	If there is a mail box or a community bulletin board at your home resort, you can put a “For sale” sign.  This will pressure the developer specially if they sell it for $20,000 USD and you offer it for $5,000.  Sometimes on the fine print of some sale agreements says that the developer has the first right to buy if your place is ever sold.  I have heard of developers paying the money (as long as is not too much) just to take the sign out.<br>   <br>  To resale or rent  a timeshare is a hard task, the basic rule is not to pay money up-front, don’t be another victim of a scam.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately over 50% of people that really need to sell their timeshare falls for this resale scams where they charge money upfront and less than 10% of them use their only real option which is to post it or offer it trough free advertising options as much, and as many sites as they can (it is ok to pay a few dollars to post in a great place but no more that $20 to $30).<br>  <br>  Timeshares do not have resale value and in most situations you would take a loss in what you paid for, as they resale for less than $2000 USD.<br>  <br>  There are some free classified ads where you can start posting:<br>   <br>  <a href="http://timeshareownerscommunity.com/" rel="nofollow">http://timeshareownerscommunity.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://craigslist.com" rel="nofollow">http://craigslist.com</a><br>  <a href="http://ebay.com" rel="nofollow">http://ebay.com</a><br>  <a href="http://recycler.com/" rel="nofollow">http://recycler.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://usfreeads.com/" rel="nofollow">http://usfreeads.com/</a>  <br>  <a href="http://www.inetgiant.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.inetgiant.com/</a><br>  <br>  Another alternative is donation, some charities take these timeshares. You can see a list of them here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://timeshareownerscommunity.com/Charities-Accepting-Timeshares-Donations.html" rel="nofollow">http://timeshareownerscommunity.com/Char...</a><br>  <br>  Donating a timeshare is a quick way to resolve your real estate burden. There are no upfront fees, the charity will handle the timeshare transfer process for you, and it is taken care of quickly. Many charities will let you start the process online, and then contact you to finish up all of the paperwork. And of course, you will have the knowledge that your donation went to help a worthy cause.<br>  <br>  One of the main advantages of donating is the tax write-off benefit. While you will generally receive more money if you sell your timeshare, if you like the idea of donating, you will still get some financial benefits. Once the timeshare transfer is complete, the charity will send you a receipt as proof. There is usually not a dollar amount attached, which is what you will need to determine yourself. Keep in mind that if the fair market value of your timeshare is over $5,000, you will need to get an appraisal to claim that amount on your taxes. You will need to pay for the appraisal yourself, which is often in the $300-$500 dollar range.

Saul1Bhuaa	My first thought was advertising.  Clearly, the hats are advertising.  They are being handed out to the public (presumably with the Company name or logo on them.)<br>  <br>  The shirts:  We may assume the shirts are intended to be worn by employees -- not as uniforms -- but as a means of getting the company name out.<br>  <br>  So, I'm for advertising.|`|Bj8Qkxs4aa	I thingk the shirts should be recorded as Public Relations. Also, under the Public Relations, it should be recorded as gifts.|`|MuXcs6FTaa	Advertising,especially if they have co. name & or logo.|`|AA11357056	The shirts could be posted to something like Employee Welfare, while the hats would be more correctly posted to some type of Advertising/Promotion account
AA10469473	If you had enough income or tax liability, yes you'd be eligible for the recovery rebate credit.  That line on your return is the amount you will get added to this year's refund.  If it's $600, you are getting the maximum amouint.  If it was zero, that would say you were not eligible for a recovery rebate.<br>  <br>  The amount you overpaid is line 62 plus line 63 minus line 61.  The amount on line 70 is added to that for your refund.|`|NwkZ5OmCaa	Yes, it's possible.<br>  <br>  The IRS is verifying every return, so don't worry about it.|`|MmTe8W8uaa	Yes, you qualify.  Line 70 is the amount that you will receive, NOT the amount that you received last year.  The software is correct.  You read the form wrong.  If you were entitled entitled to the credit, then line 70 would be zero.
V9qmbFQOaa	Why not start a dog-walking service or garden watering? You can make flyers to put around the neighbourhood and in letter boxes. Lots of people would be glad of someone to do these jobs for them and you can request you are paid in cash only. <br>  Another idea is baby sitting although looking after toddlers who you can play with is better than the responsibility of tiny babies.|`|4cFCToQNaa	paper route<br>  babysit<br>  if your relatives own a business ask for a job there.<br>  look for change in the coach<br>  audition for a talent agency<br>  join the circus<br>  create a new invention<br>  <br>  Oh btw right now its really hard for anyone to find a job so...good luck kid|`|5UIdcMgIaa	Maybe You can help paint Your neighbor her house or what ever.:D<br>  Or be a babysitter ..

Pjm9pg7iaa	You are breaking the Craigslist rules by posting so many ads. You are supposed to wait 7 days before reposting.  If you are selling 15 different items, this is not a problem. But you said that you are changing the title which means you are only changing it to avoid getting caught. <br>  Someone is reporting you to Craigslist as they see your ads bundled..|`|e3e94f5bc430c40ed461bd51f2b3552eaa	Your proxies are probably beat..your using public proxies that soemone already used on CL<br>  <br>  thats my theory
AA10097817	Personally, I see the major disadvantage as the cost of shipping. You may be limited to local avenues. I think I would look into resin look-alikes before I purchased a piece of stone furniture.|`|Q1zc0TOtaa	Contact trade associations, embassies or for free information on buyers and importers of stone furniture, send product details and a request by email to sell@epog.org|`|lMH2cA1kaa	It is very difficult for the stone industry as stone products belong to "luxury" items, and stone is closely related to house market. It is bad. <br>  <br>  In the time of good economy, you may attend some "home and garden" trade shows or stone expos. I am sure this will generate revenues for you.
49740c9daeea677fc86801fb2b3f41deaa	The assessment has nothing to do with the actual value.   You need to get yourself a new real estate agent, yours should have explained this a lot better.  <br>  <br>  Have your agent run a BPO, that will give you the actual fair market value.|`|fa49fc3460e0c0dfb37b6cda6aa1dd56aa	The city has no idea what the house will sell for.  The assessed value is used for property taxes only.  Example.  My home is worth over $500,000.00...however my assessment is $389,000.00...which is the amount my property taxes are based on.<br>  <br>  If the asking price is $99,900.00 a fair offer is between $90,000.00-95,000.00.  $81,000.00 is almost $20,000.00 below asking price will mostly likely rejected.|`|d1431527582f8f414e0e05855712ef5faa	Assessed value is to assess taxes, not value. Current market value is based on similar sales within the neighborhood. $89,000 would be fair.
PN2CjFYcaa	FMS (Financial Management Services) handles the debt for child support.  The money would be filtered through them to pay the child support debt.|`|0FAMJkvAaa	The IRS will deduct the amount owed to DHS and pay them directly.  If there is any balance, that will be your refund.

46eedfcc0d431f5086b7b4cfa950eb57aa	Is it furnished ? Table, chairs, sofa, tv. bed, dishes, pots and pans, silverware, etc. Just think about what you had at home.|`|EFOBeGu4aa	Just a few things that I can think of that aren't obvious.  Flash light, medical supplies, toilet plunger, a screw driver (both kinds), hammer and lots of batteries for the smoke detector.  If your apartment allows it, candles in case the lights go out.  Be sure to have blankets too. It gets awful cold when the lights go out and there is no heat.  You might also see if there is any security devices you can purchase to secure your door.  Do not answer your door unless you know the person knocking.|`|SK2gGFoyaa	Because there are so many things you'll need (and many that you'll want), it would be insane to list them all. I found a book at the library that actually lists just about everything you can think of as a sort of checklist for planning your first apartment. Consider getting it or checking it out on Ebay, Amazon or Half.com if your library doesn't have access to it. I can't remember the name of the book but literally lists everything from curtains to soup ladles to candles to ... you get the point. <br>  <br>  You could look around your current residence and start listing everything you see that you want or need in your new place. You can use a paper notebook or computer word processor to keep track... your choice.
ot1ZZexeaa	I wouldn't go to a nurse who got her BSN online. Would you go to a Doctor who got his medical degree online? Would you let a surgeon operate on you who had received his training online?<br>  <br>  Why not sit for your boards and immediately start working as a nurse? Most big hospitals have bridge program, which enable to you to earn your Bachelor's degree while working. This is much better route. <br>  <br>  There is no such thing as an easy degree. You'll get what you put in/pay for.|`|f6ZFjatlaa	Most of them now are online. There is nothing wrong with doing it online in fact you may find it hard to find one that is not web based. Most of the classes you'll be taking are theory, you've already learned your basic skills, you'll be gaining experience working and you will still likely have clinical rotations aside from your online classes.
AA11540024	I'm sure you can if he was born in '08|`|WuDXQGBgaa	yes,as long as your child was born by 12/31/2008 you can claim them on your tax return.the irs considers the child to be your dependent for the whole year,usually.but since the child was in the hospital and not living in your home i'm not sure if the same rule still applies.<br>  <br>  someone else who knows for sure may answer this question,if not you can call the irs at 1-800-829-1040 to be sure.|`|AA10091923	yes...as long as the birth occurred prior to december 31st midnite....you are good.<br>  <br>  great question  :)|`|MmTe8W8uaa	Yes, if all other requirements are met.  Time temporarily away from home to receive medical care (in a hospital, for example) counts as time lived with you.  Under this definition, he lived with you from the day he was born until 12/31/08, except when temporarily away from home to receive medical care (in the hospital).  Because he lived with you (under the government's definition of living with someone) for the entire portion of 2008 that he was alive, he is treated for tax purposes as having lived with you for all of 2008.|`|fSlZQzS4aa	No problem.  It is the same as if he was alive all year.
GSn3m2sAaa	Your mom should not claim you on her taxes once you get married, but on the 2008 taxes she has the right to if you depended on her that year.<br>  <br>  As for next year, my suggestion is to file with and online service, such as taxact.com or turbotax.com and try filing both ways. With a simple click of a button you can switch back and forth, and see which way is better for you. Most of the time, filing jointly is better, if you and your spouse are both employed. However, if only one of you works or depending on your specific situation it may be better for you to file seperately. It never hurts to check both, especially when it's so easy.|`|e38589381fb1a85912079b7470ade24aaa	You probably should check with a CPA to make sure it's on the up & up.  People that are married usually file jointly, but then most people who are married don't live in the same house as a single head of household.  Is this the case?<br>  <br>  I advise you to move out.  If you don't live with your mom for 6 months of the year, she cannot claim you as a dependent and you must file for yourselves separately or together jointly.|`|HeFlBmGSaa	No, I do not believe your mom can claim you as a dependent when you are married. If she does, you will have more of a tax liability so try to tell her no.<br>  <br>  As far as filing goes, you can file married filing jointly or you can file married filing separate. Typically, you are better off married filing jointly.|`|3bf7da2259d28e45f4c681b16aac7cfcaa	No your mom can't claim you anymore because you'll no longer be seen as a dependent. And yes you can file your taxes separately but I advise you to do it together because you get more money back. But just to make sure. Ask the person who does your mom's taxes.|`|zuGKIWfNaa	Your mom can claim you as a dependent for 2008, because you weren't married during that year. If you get married during 2009, then she cannot claim you as a dependent for that year (unless you still live with her and she supports you!)<br>  <br>  You and your new husband should file a joint return next year. It almost never makes financial sense for married couples to file separately.|`|MmTe8W8uaa	When you file next year, you may file either "married filing separately" or "married filing jointly", at your option, but you will not be allowed to file as single.<br>  <br>  If you elect to file as "married filing jointly", then your mother will no longer be allowed to claim you, UNLESS the joint return was only a claim for a full refund of all tax withheld AND there would have been no tax liability for you or your spouse if you had filed separately.<br>  <br>  If you elect to file as "married filing separately", then your marriage has no effect on what your mother can do.
f6y3pM4oaa	Based on the banks policies, yes you are entitled to a fair evaluation on your credit; however, based on personal experience it is impossible for you as a 18 year old child to get a loan of 1-1.5 million dollars unless you have a collateral such as your dad's business and I truly will not suggest you to do that as you seem to not have much experience as a business owner. Owning a business is not easy: It is not just opening a store and let it run by itself. You have to put a lot of effort on it and time as well. Why don't you start doing something smaller rather than just opening your first business with a investment of over 1M, that's just way too much for you. You might be able to get loans from local youth business federations but usually they will give out around 15k for really good business plans only. You see the difference between 15k and 1M. Hope everything goes well with you and dont take my opinion as an offense because it is just my personal experience|`|SK2gGFoyaa	It's not impossible ... but with the credit crunch, it's not going to be easy. Your background might help you but you may wish to consider approaching investors and approaching people you know and love for personal backing (ie co-signing). What is YOU were a banker and someone came to you with the same question you're asking of us???|`|BOOLN0O8aa	Legally you can. Practically, you won't be able to. You don't have any collateral or a good business plan to present to the bank.
NwkZ5OmCaa	The IRS has a theory--at some point you cut your loses.<br>  <br>  If you can't show a reasonable expectation that you will become profitable soon, then the IRS can argue this is a hobby and limit your losses to your income.|`|2N6oTOLQaa	There's no limit to the number of years you can claim a business loss on your taxes. However as a general rule of thumb, if your business isn't showing a net profit after 3 years, they will become very suspicious and you become a prime suspect for an in depth audit. If you have good records and can justify every little expense, then you will make it through the audit without too many changes.
2N6oTOLQaa	STOP!<br>  <br>  The first answers are correct in saying that if you want to change your tax return you need to file an amendment using form 1040-X. <br>  <br>  However, there is no reason for you to waste your time doing so. Over 15% of tax returns this year have errors on the Recovery Rebate Credit. Because of all the confusion, the IRS is checking every return. They will make the adjustment and send you the correct amount without penalty. It might delay your refund a little bit, but filling an amendment would delay it more. In fact the IRS website says that errors in the Recovery Rebate Credit will delay your refund by a week at the most. <br>  <br>  If the Recovery Rebate Credit was the only thing you needed to correct, then there's no need to file an amendment with 1040-X. Just expect your refund to be reduced by the amount of the error.|`|oYhuLsTOaa	You cannot withdraw a filed return.  If you made errors and need to correct them, you file an "amended" return using form 1040-X.<br>  <br>  It is possible the IRS may catch the error when your return is processed.  If so, they will send you a notice advising you of the changes they propose and the impact to the refund you claimed on your return.  However, if the error is not caught at processing, the IRS still has 3 years to review your return and raise the matter again, this time in the form of a tax audit.  Depending on the nature of the issues, amount and time elapsed, you could be subject to interest charges and/or penalties charges as well as the original amount of overpayment.<br>  <br>  If you know you have made an error, the best thing is to file an amended return using 1040-X.  Audits can be time consuming, and besides, why risk having to give back part of the refund in the form of interest & penalty charges?|`|MmTe8W8uaa	You cannot withdraw a tax return.  If anything was incorrect, then you MUST "amend" (change) the tax return by filing a paper Form 1040X to correct whatever was incorrect.  This form cannot be e-filed; send it by U.S. mail.|`|c8b96c428b5adcbe941b94e428a6e7afaa	file a 1040X - an ammended return|`|UDxL7lPqaa	You file a "return."  Any overpayment is a "refund."  If you screwed up your return, file an amended return (Form 1040X).
kMK9E2a7aa	It's not just the Pension people. You have to notify the inland revenue and the NHS. If you go to live in another EU country you can have your pension transferred quite easily, provided you have a bank account in your new country. If you are out of the UK for 183 days, then you are technically a resident in your new country and may have to pay your taxes there. As for the NHS. The same applies. Once you leave the UK you can no longer use the NHS in the UK except for emergency treatment. You must make the effort to join the Polish health service. The Pension service will help you with the by giving you an E121. You will present that in your new country and it will speed the process up. Having said all of that, many Brits do fail to mention some of these facts when moving abroad. I'm just telling you what you should do.|`|OzPheiN1aa	Yes you can get your state retirement pension paid in Poland, however, other benefits can not be paid while you are abroad and it is them they are interested in (eg pension credit, attendance allowance or DLA)<br>  <br>  all EU and EEA countries have reciprocal agreements, it is only outside Europe it can be a problem, but even then the former colonial countries usually have reciprocity agreements|`|2c726775df1bee382684b2b2b4d3e248aa	It all depends on whether the British Government has a reciprocal agreement with Poland regarding pensions.

9a881112567263b20d6262238853cc86aa	You won't need a 982 but you will need a Schedule D to report the "sale" of the property.  As this is a non-recourse loan, it is treated as if you sold the home for the balance of the loan.  If the loan value is higher than your basis, you may have a taxable gain.  If it is less, and you lived in the property, you have a non-deductible loss.<br>  <br>  One thing to note is that will the mortgage debt forgiveness on the federal return is up to $2 million, I believe that it is only $800,000 for the California return.  This probably won't effect you but it may.|`|AA11555162	If this is a nonrecourse loan you do not need a 1099C. A 1099C is for cancelled debt and we use it to figure how much of the forgiven loan is taxable. If you are not responsible for it there is nothing to forgive or tax so dont worry about it.

bFRVSDteaa	In past years, NY state has often delayed paying tax refunds when cash was tight. This is nothing new. NY state will never admit it, but the consensus is that this is related to the end of the state's fiscal year. The NY state income tax refund flow tends to drop to a trickle in February and March, and then go back to normal after the new fiscal year starts on April 1.

fSlZQzS4aa	You are asking for professional help.  That does not come free.|`|U7FiK02Iaa	IRS is federal and isn't in any particular state. Is it state taxes you owe? If it is the IRS you can set up a payment plan with them. If you haven't paid it off by the time you file your next return and are entitled to a refund, the IRS will keep your refund to pay your debt. If anything is left over, you will get the difference, otherwise you will not receive your refund.

And, if your close to your maximum limit on a card that will also lower your score.|`|qjZMTUcsaa	There are a LOT of factors that can impact your credit score. One of the biggest factors is DTI or debt to income. if you paid off all your bills but still have a lot of outstanding credit or you have opened new unused lines of credit this may raise your DTI and therefore lower your score. They view you as "an accident looking for a place to happen." you will have too much credit out. Also any time you run your credit that counts against you AND how long you have had credit also plays an important role. Your credit score will always fluctuate over time as well. I hate answers here that give advice but if you really want to win with money stop using credit all together and learn how to pay cash for stuff.
UT5HS39Daa	I work as a nurse at a hospital in Greater Atlanta, and we are allowed tattoos, but no facial piercings other than ears.  I had to take out my nose stud when I started the job. I have 2 tattoos, but they are not visible with scrubs (on my shoulder, and foot)  Although this is a rule at my hospital, many employers do judge you by appearance, and could consider that as a reason to not hire you.  <br>  Also-- my mom works at a smaller rural hospital, and they do not allow visible tattoos or peircings, as the town is a more conservative place than Atlanta.  <br>  So I would say that it is all about location, and where you want to work.  A more conservative small town, or a larger, more liberal type city.  And also if you want to work in a doctor's office or a hospital.   I would think (I don't know this as a fact), that doctor's offices would be more apt to wanting no tattoos.  <br>  I would say that you wouldn't have too hard of a problem finding a job, but you may want to consider what I said.  If you do go through with school, make a good first impression, and try to remain professional, and act like know what you're doing.

Make sure you cover them up. Better to have them removed.  In these hard economic times most anything will kill your application chances as this is an employer's market.  If you going into the medical profession, tatts convey an unclean element.  They may look cute, but most medical facilities [even in the medical office environment] want them to be covered.<br>  <br>  On your second point, jobs are hard for everyone to come by.  Many employers from Bible Colleges to Museums are letting people go.  Have several back up plans or alternatives for employment.  One who has a variety of skills will never want for a job.  <br>  <br>  Truth makes one feel better in the long run.

You will pay regular interest.<br>  /
HeFlBmGSaa	The answer to your question almost always is "No." Most credit cards that have an introductory rate will not charge you the interest you would have accrued. They will simply start charging you the 9% interest once that period is over. <br>  <br>  What I do is I find out the exact date that the 0% period is over and I put it in my Outlook calendar about 2 weeks ahead of time so that I have plenty of time to either pay off the balance or transfer the balance to another card offering a 0% rate. I've played that balance transfer game for years and it works as long as you have a system so that you don't forget when they start to charge you interest.

oReGA5kEaa	Insurance of all types differ risk. The idea is a group of people all contribute to a fund for whatever the risk is. In this case, it's medical expenses. Insurance companies will place you in a risk pool of similar people with the same likelihood to file a claim. Everyone in the pool contributes to a fund. Not everyone will need to file a claim during that year, so there is more money available to those who do need to file claims than they have put into it. So the risk is differed amongst the group of people.<br>  Insurance companies are regulated by each state's insurance commissioner. Every year they present their rating plans to the insurance commissioner and he/she will approve it or require the insurance company to make changes. If the company is making too much profit (usually anything over 12%) than the commissioner can require the company to lower it's rates or even issue refund checks to it's customers.<br>  The rising cost of health insurance is not because the insurance companies are making more money, it's because they are paying more and more in claims. Creating a public health insurance system will not address the real issue which is why is medical care so expensive? I'll leave that for another question.|`|URO3gDXcaa	let's say you are at home and trip and break your arm.  you need to have surgery as it is broken in 3 places.  without the insurance you are responsible for the full amount of the charges.  and it will be at least $5,000.  with insurance, you pay a certain amount a month and depending on what type of coverage you have, you will be responsible for $50 - $1000.  it is the uncertainty that seems like a losing deal.  but it is a risk i am willing to pay for.|`|5dawOJcpaa	i think they can earn about 120b$ a year. they need the money because the government is planning to declare war on the vatican state and italy cause the vatican is planning to revive the holy roman empire. it means it the end of the world if the roman empire will revive its armagedon it says in the bible on revalation everyone will have a microchip on their hand and it is the mark of the beast the 666. its alpha and omega the beginnig and the end. thats why america is going to save the world but even so we can't win cause its already our fate it says in the bible..|`|7HKTDcvYaa	The need for insurance for medical services arises mostly from the fact that when people need medical care they may not be well enough to earn and pay for it.  Now this is not the majority of health care dollars, it is however the only significant reason for requiring health insurance.<br>  <br>  Allowing people to buy insurance  so that they are not driven into bankruptcy or even poverty, that is not entirely necessary, but if one is covering to ensure health care will be paid for when the insured is sick and unable to pay, then implicitly one is covering to avoid bankruptcy and poverty as a consequence of health care costs, unless the coverage covers only after the patient runs out of money.<br>  <br>  Most people faced with a choice between a policy that pays for the cost of medical care or one that pays only if one goes bankrupt might prefer to have one that also avoids bankruptcy, but this is not unavoidable.  But creditors would feel aggrieved if a policy paid only when the patient becomes bankrupt. They would reasonably complain that one is favoring one class of creditor over another. <br>  <br>  Now the need for compulsory insurance also appears to be based on a principle of religion, the principle called the Good Samaritan rule. We do in general accept that all of society has an obligation to be the Good Samaritan and pay the medical costs of anyone unable to do so. So, we insist that able people contribute to the enrichment of the medical community.<br>  <br>  When Canada is used as an example to argue for mandatory medical insurance, we have to remember that in Canada, spending on medical care and education are Canada's biggest government budget items. Canada has repeatedly been faced with budgetary limitations on  the amount of money that may be spent in total. Canada too has found that being the Good Samaritan has a big sticker price.|`|9NlbIOUFaa	Using google to find some related info or you could try using answer engines such as yahoo answer or yedda.com to obtain some useful ideas.however,If you want some direct infomation,here  <a href="http://www.healthinsurance-onlinetips.info/health-insurance-for-free.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.healthinsurance-onlinetips.in...</a>  is a nice one from my experience.|`|UDxL7lPqaa	The overall purpose of insurance (any type) is protection and shared risk.

I'm not a kid...I get that."<br>  <br>  If you understand this part of it then I'm confused at what you don't get.  A broken arm is a simplistic example too.  I know of a guy who thought it'd be a good idea to go without insurance for a couple months and he had a heart attack.  He was forced to sell his home to pay his medical bills.<br>  <br>  I also know of a guy that had a $275,000 heart bypass and paid next to nothing.  I'm pretty sure these guys don't see insurance companies as money gouging organizations.  The first guy wished he had it and the second thanking his lucky starts that he did.<br>  <br>  Insurance started in the with the feudal system in Europe hundreds of years ago with the simple promise that if a farmer died the other farmers would farm his land to provide for his spouse and family.  That of course was one of the early forms of life insurance.<br>  <br>  The mechanics:  The money comes in from premiums and goes out for claims.  The margins are very thin.  They collect a lot of money because hospitals aren't cheap so they have to send out a lot of money.  So, don't blame the insurance companies, blame the end users, the lawyers that send up the liability costs for the providers, and the providers of the care.  You can blame insurance companies for other things, but not necessarily the cost of care.<br>  <br>  I have one group with 150 people that over the course of a year or so they paid in about $200,000 in premiums for the group, but the insurance company had to pay out more than $300,000 in claims.  Surely some of those 150 people had no claims whatsoever, but over the course of the time those that did have claims had more than the insurance company anticipated.  So the additional funds came from the pocket of the 'money gouging organization.'<br>  <br>  Insurance is money.  You buy insurance to provide the money when you need it in the time of a car accident, hospital bill, untimely death, disability, plane crash, tornado, etc....  You're paying to transfer the risk of losing your wealth and assets at the occurance of an unexpected event.<br>  <br>  If you think they're evil organizations then at least right now you HAVE THE CHOICE to accept the risk and make your own decision to do so.  There are some in Washington that want to take that choice away from you and force you to pay for something you may or may not want.

Ch9TedMcaa	Zeus left out the huge deficit Reagan left the country.|`|Saul1Bhuaa	Here's the proof.<br>  <br>  Reagan lowered tax rates, and tax revenues increased.  Mathematically, we know tax revenues have an optimal value.  The minimum value occurs at 0% and 100%.  (At 0%, no taxes are collected.  At 100%, nobody works and no taxes are collected.  Thus, by the Extreme Value Theorem, the maximum value of taxes collected occurs at a rate between 0% and 100%.)<br>  <br>  So, as I said, under Reagan, tax revenues increased while tax rates decreased.<br>  <br>  Keep "taxing the rich", and you'll see tax revenues drop.|`|IgaW4g8Naa	your ideas are off base.  it was the artificially low interest rates that fueled the expansion of the clinton era not the raising of taxes.|`|SLQPoMK2aa	Reagan gave us a huge defict. The budget got balanced under Clinton and went into a huge defict under Bush....|`|Rhl26nMjaa	the us' corporate tax rate is also higher than most of europes|`|e2UOEwj2aa	I will answer your question in simple terms, but it truly is not simple.  People, firms, etc. invest in projects & assets that produce positive NPV.  Some firms issue debt.  Investors get taxed on income from bonds. If taxes are higher on that income they will pay less for those bonds in order to reach the required return.  This increases the cost of capital for firms and increases the hurdle rate that firms need to meet in order to invest in NPV projects.  Also to some extent taxes affect the after tax return of those investments.  As the AT returns become lower it does not make risk adjusted sense to invest in some projects.  For the above mentioned reasons as projects do not receive capital the economy does not grow at its optimal level, thus reducing overall GDP and causing the economy to slow. <br>  <br>  Also as some have mentioned interest rates affected the growth during Clinton's years more then higher taxes, it could be argued that growth would have been higher under Clinton with lower tax rates. Rates at 3 or 5% are historically low. Remember, the negative affect of higher tax rates will be cancelled out or will be offset by positive affect of lower interest rates and vica versa.  Economics is a science of affects and influences and nothing is ever exactly.

And here is the problem, there is very little that the business owner can do.  But don't worry, the stations bump up the price of fuel and general merchandise to offset the loss (hence, we all pay for it).<br>  <br>  I have no tolerance for pricks like that!|`|sG6TocPeaa	Have you seen Office Space? If not it was most likely something similar to this. What happens is that if it is a fairly large company and she was not taking large sums of money at once, they probably just didn't notice because it seemed insignificant.
UNRSKPhRaa	There's no need to go into great detail. <br>  <br>  You're right not to mention the commute, but just tell them the rest. That you weren't happy at that company due to some of their practices, left on amicable terms and took some personal time to be with family before you started job hunting again. <br>  <br>  Most interviewers will accept that. The only area they may wish to probe is the practices that your previous company used which you disagreed with - if they operate in a similar fashion, they will know you're not a good fit for this post. Be a little careful about getting specific here, especially if it's a rival firm... if you'll give up their trade secrets in an interview, then you can't be trusted. <br>  <br>  Good luck in the interview.|`|q74P5eGTaa	Lol you have one of the best possible answers right there in the truth.<br>  <br>  "I did not agree with some of the companies Policies"<br>  <br>  That answer pretty much moves your interview right on along.
CadIYXdXaa	Do whatever makes you happy, and I agree - with today's economy if the job pays well keep it for as long as you can. Focus on what you can for now, but continue to seek out the extra tech stuff from your bosses when you can. Also try doing some of the tech stuff (samples etc) on your own time and show your boss.<br>  <br>  Not being from the States could put you at a disadvantage at that job/company, but keep trying and also try to pick up more of the slang and terms that are used there that you may not be familiar with. If you have someone you trust there, ask them about terms etc as you hear them to help give you a better understanding.

mTVFb1u7aa	day trading would not work at all in this economic climate. be grateful that you actually have a job. now is a good time to buy stock, but only if you're willing to hold it for long term. day trading right now is risky. also your numbers are way exaggerated. if these numbers and gains were true, then everyone would quit their job and become a day trader. there's a reason people don't and that's stability.|`|AA10566552	I have day traded professionally in the past for a short period of time.  Your theory has a number of holes.  First, most day traders do not typically hold 10 stocks at one time, and they don't hold stocks in their accounts overnight.  Day traders usually have 100% cash in their accounts at the end of each trading day.  Secondly, day traders rarely hold on to a stock for a 3 to 5% gain.  Day traders are primarily momentum traders who chase fast moving stocks.  We would typically trade in 1000 share increments, but would only hold on for .25 point to .50 point gains.  Of course with gains, there are always losses.  The psychology of day trading is very challenging.  The temptation to hold on to a loser can be overwhelming.  For this reason, losses can be much larger than gains.  There are successful day traders, but it is truly an art.<br>  <br>  Even with a buy and hold strategy, it is not realistic to think that you can consistently make 3 to 5% gains on all of your stocks on a weekly basis.  The lure of trading stocks in your living room on a professional level can be great, but the reality can be devastating.<br>  <br>  If you quit your job, have another job lined up.  Don't think you can trade stocks for a living.|`|CDqKAIEAaa	Don't do it, said the professional to the neophyte.<br>  <br>  Your strategy alone is a huge red flag.

It seems to me that that would only work until you experience your first loss.<br>  <br>  If you buy 10 stocks at random and 2 go up 5% that's good, but it 1 goes down 50% that's going to hurt. <br>  <br>  I would suggest you.<br>  <br>  1. Actually have a reason for buying them.  Try to develop a strategy for when you plan on buying it.  What signal do you want to use to create your buy signal.<br>  <br>  2. Have a target. Make a target based on something, like support or resistance. <br>  <br>  3. Limit your losses.  This is the biggest thing you can do to make sure you last as a trader.  <br>  <br>  4. Have both long and short positions on at the same time.  This way you can make money if the market goes up or if the market goes down. <br>  <br>  There is a lot to learn but if you do take the time you could make an Ok living with $100k.

AA10566552	I am assuming the options are "out of the money" options.  This is an incentive to employees to boost earnings and thus, stock value.  Let's say that your company's stock value is currently $20 / share.  If you own 10 June $25 call contracts, this would give you the right to buy 1000 shares of stock (one contract gives you the right to purchase 100 shares) at $25 / share by the 3rd Friday in June.  If on June 19, the stock is at $35 / share, the options will be worth $10,000.  If the stock is at $15 / share, the options will be worthless.  If your options are "in the money" at expiration, you can either sell the options or exercise the options (convert the options to stock).  You do not have to wait until expiration to sell or exercise the options.  Options also have "time value" and "volatility value" but that will require a deeper discussion.<br>  <br>  The most important thing is to remember to exercise or sell the options prior to expiration if the value of the stock is greater than the strike price near expiration.  Otherwise you will be throwing away free money.|`|xKLydoTpaa	don't know the details of your employer's plan - basically they are giving you an option to buy stock in the company you work for|`|YL8R3Jubaa	Your employer should provide you with more information on the type of stock options you received and the implications.  There are two common types qualified and non-qualified stock option grants.  The basic idea is that the stock options are granted at a specific price for a specific period of time, usually 10 years.  If the stock goes above the grant price you make money if it doesn't they are worthless.  There are tax implications to stock grants.  Generally it is best to exercise stock grants near the expiration date.  This is just basic stuff, you need to get more information to make a informed decision.

If they knew they had a problem with the pipes but didn't fix it until it was running through the walls, then they would likely be held liable for your damages. The hard part is proving that if it is true. Ask around to your other neighbors and see if they had/saw any damage from within the last couple months. If so, you might be on to something.<br>  <br>  One thing to add to the other comments; if you do get renters insurance (and you should) make sure to talk to your agent about coverage specifically for electronic equipment like computers and stereos. You will not have much coverage with a standard policy but you can easily list out your items to get them covered.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|12VQ4ETcaa	Oops, sorry!  Renters insurance would be the only thing to cover you.<br>  <br>  That's also true if the building were to burn down.

zKn9IXygaa	After you've done everything that's needed<br>  <br>  1<br>  Choose a tightly focused theme or niche for your online store around something that you are passionate or knowledgeable about. By focusing on a specific theme for your store, you'll garner a competitive advantage over other stores that are larger and forced to be broader in nature. This specific focus will give your store more credibility, and will position you to provide detailed information about certain kinds of products. Customers will appreciate the level of coverage you provide on a given subject, which will be helpful for making purchasing decisions.<br>  Step2<br>  Choose an underlying infrastructure for your online store. One fast and free way to get started quickly is to open a Zlio store.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://setup.zlio.com" rel="nofollow">http://setup.zlio.com</a><br>  <br>  With Zlio, you'll be able to sell products from buy.com and other brand name merchants and earn a commission on every sale. You'll also get about half the advertising revenue you generate through Google Adsense. The upside of Zlio is that its fast, its intuitive, and its free, so you can see what its like to start an online store without spending any money on upfront costs.<br>  <br>  Another reasonable option for starting a free online store is CafePress.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cafepress.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.cafepress.com</a><br>  <br>  With CafePress, you can start an online shop for free selling merchandise that you design [like customized t-shirts, posters, bumperstickers etc] and then generate earnings paid out monthly.<br>  <br>  Additionally, if you're willing to pay a monthly fee, some folks like Yahoo Merchant Services.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://smallbusiness.yahoo.com/ecommerce/">http://smallbusiness.yahoo.com/ecommerce...</a><br>  <br>  With Yahoo, you'll pay a monthly fee in exchange for the framework of an online store. The upside of Yahoo is that you can sell, carry, and fulfill your own inventory of products (rather than outsourcing it through Zlio or CafePress). The downside of Yahoo is that, well, you get to sell, carry, and fulfill your own inventory of products.<br>  <br>  Lastly, I'm going to give a quick mention to FlyingCart, which offers a service similar to Yahoo's but with less expensive monthly fees.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.flyingcart.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.flyingcart.com</a><br>  <br>  With FlyingCart, you get the basic architecture/framework of an online store and generally have to pay a monthly fee less than that of Yahoo. There are also some interesting social networking features. It lets you sell, carry, and fulfill your own inventory.<br>  <br>  All things considered, we recommend that folks start by setting up a Zlio store and then take things from there. Zlio is free, which makes it a good way to learn about starting an online store. <a href="http://setup.zlio.com" rel="nofollow">http://setup.zlio.com</a><br>  Step3<br>  Build-out your product inventory. Be careful to put the best products at the top of the page. Product placement counts and studies have shown that products placed at the top of the page tend to sell the best. Keep your inventory of products fresh. Try to write reviews that will help your customers make better puchasing decisions. Stay true to the theme of your store. Stay focused.<br>  Step4<br>  Promote your store. Remember, this is not Field of Dreams. "If you build it they will come" will not apply to our new store! As entrepreneurs, its up to us to generate interest in our own online store. You should strongly consider writing some helpful articles about the products in your store and publishing them [give squidoo a try for this]. For instance, on my hot sauce store, The Hot Sauce Collector, I wrote a series of articles about The Hottest Hot Sauce In The World. These articles help my customers find the hottest hot sauces and consistently drive traffic to my site.<br>  <br>  Reference:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.squidoo.com/thehottesthotsauce/" rel="nofollow">http://www.squidoo.com/thehottesthotsauc...</a><br>  Step5<br>  Manage and track your web store. Now that you've put all this energy into creating an online store, don't you want to see how many visitors you have and how they found your site?

bankzwwYaa	Depends on your employee manual.<br>  <br>  If you have a "use it or lose it" policy, you can lose that time off, and the associated pay for it.<br>  <br>  If you have a policy where you can accrue  time off by carrying it over from previous years or earn it in increments during the current year, they MUST pay you for that ACCRUED time, NOT the total time.<br>  <br>  My company has the latter policy. I designed our corporate manual to give security to employees when we asked them NOT to take time off, so that if they did lose their jobs, they got paid for the time we told them not to take off, or they chose to save on their own to take advantage of family leave instances, etc etc etc . <br>  <br>  Unless you have a collective bargaining agreement, the company can change policy any time they wish. If the company is losing money, you can count on them cutting "bennies".<br>  <br>  My advice to you is to ask for the written notification of change in policy, and that you begin to find employment elsewhere. This company appears to be in trouble, and you might want to " Git while the gittin's good"....
U3j7oVflaa	Assuming it's not the fridge that you are worried about (and it probably is, since you're worried about it...) <br>  <br>  A couple possibilities come to mind...<br>  <br>  1) There could be something with a short sucking power all the time, try unplugging some appliances when they aren't in use and see if it makes a significant difference.<br>  <br>  2) The 3*C difference in heating might not be making much of a difference in terms of how often your heaters are on and how much heat they have to produce... in some scenarios, depending on differential pressures and insulation, going from 15C->18C might be 95% the cost of remaining at 15C, depending on temp fluctuation, etc.<br>  <br>  So, what were the summer bills like?<br>  <br>  3) A third possibility is a mixture of 1 and 2...<br>  <br>  4) Also, it's possible that, depending on the layout of your house, someone could have latched on to an external power source... I have power outlets on the outside of my house that someone could plug something into, and I probably wouldn't notice for weeks... maybe you do, too?<br>  <br>  5) If you are in a duplex or apt building, sometimes the power consumption is "shared" between the two, as in, one or two of your neighbors "rooms" might be wired to your slice of the bill, and one or two of your rooms wired to theirs... That's really rare, but possible...<br>  Check to make sure that all the power consumption comes from your actual property and not your neighbors who are on the same bill.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|4b127bdc65641a05881903d7090f19c2aa	Maybe you need better insulation or weatherstripping around the windows.

793RNStWaa	This is VERY important, and even applies to more than a home loan...!<br>  <br>  Whenever you ask any bank to loan you money, they consider much more than just the defaults on your credit report.  They will look at (for both you and your partner) your current income vs. expenses, credit score, payment and default history, your other creditors (ie., some banks, but not all, will allow a little room for medical or other debts that are being investigated, etc.)  They even take into consideration, any LACK of credit you both may have.<br>  <br>  I found it tremendously beneficial to subscribe to one of those credit reporting websites (there are several that are legit and secure.)  I was able to view instantly upon subscribing, my credit report, by all three bureaus, Experian, Equifax and TransUnion.  I also paid a little extra to get my score which I could see instantly.  I can access my reports whenever I want and when something changes on my credit or score, with any of the three bureaus, I am notified immediately by email.<br>  <br>  I found it worth every dime to do this as opposed to the once per year free report, because I quickly found a huge amount of errors (such as residences I never had and creditors I never defaulted with) in my credit that I would never have known about otherwise.<br>  <br>  Plus I was able to submit investigation requests for every error with each company, and request  corrections online.<br>  <br>  One credit reporting company (I won't say which one here) had so many errors and failed to report my positive credit history, that my score with them was considerably lower than the other agencys.  This means that any bank or other vendor who used this particular agency for their credit apps, would deny me for credit because of these errors, when I would otherwise be approved.<br>  <br>  Whether or not you do an online subscription...<br>  <br>  Be sure to get a credit report AND your score with EACH reporting agency BEFORE you apply for the loan.<br>  <br>  I also recommend asking your loan officer which agency the bank will use (there will probably be more than one bank and agency used for your loan application.)  Then get a credit report for that agency and make sure there are no mistakes.  Be sure to know your score too.  Don't wait until you get denied for a loan.<br>  <br>  Expect to pay for some of this.  It's not a lot, but I know to get your score there is a small fee.|`|0yqQg9CXaa	Get the home in your name only.<br>  That way you will get the best interest rates which will save you thousands.<br>  /|`|uVXfuZSvaa	Even if your partner has a charged off account does not mean it's all bad. It really just depends on the lender.  Some bad credit can give you a good score believe it or not.  I have seen credit scores in the 600+ and people have 1-2 judgments on them.  I have also seen the credit reports that have good standing credit lines but low score.  If the lender is basing the interest on the credit score or on the good standing and outstanding credit lines.<br>  <br>  P.S. Make sure that the account that is now paid but was charged off at one time is corrected on his credit report.

Even the carpet need to be replaced, you still can try to negotiate cos' it wasn't brand new when you move in.

If it was 8 years old, you owe 20% of the cost.<br>  <br>  No judge will award the landlord the full cost of the carpet replacement.

XAw4cJmjaa	I would contact the New York division of disability and see what they have to say before you move. I wouldn't think you would have a problem since you are already on disability, but to stop a problem, might want to check with New York before hands and see if there is any paperwork you need to fill out. Or, check and see if they require information from Vermont's division of disability. Never hurts to check on it be-forehands.|`|9FxR4khCaa	Here is a link that lists the income for eligibility.

The states may have different income levels or different requirements for disability.  (Of course, its also possible that you could be considered eligible in both states.)<br>  <br>  You may want to contact a Medicaid representative in New York to ask questions about eligibility, before you move.  Or check the Medicaid website for New York to see if they list eligibility criteria there.|`|aYVRp5zbaa	If you're disabled, you should received the same benefits, but not sure about your fiance and the kids because every state is different....just make sure you notify your department of social services or case manager before moving.

Pjm9pg7iaa	You are going to have to make the workmen into "partners".  When the work is done, you will sell the house and pay them 110% of their normal pay. Otherwise, no one is loaning for fixup money..|`|O8qdCBzLaa	If you have enough equity in your primary residence to take out a loan (probably a home equity line of credit, or HELOC), you can use that cash for whatever you want. Including fixing up a rental property. <br>  <br>  And, remember that those repairs are tax deductible. And, so is the interest on the HELOC.
vEj71xuIaa	1) They're worried that people won't save enough money otherwise.<br>  <br>  2) It makes it harder to cheat on taxes -- paying taxes twice a week instead of once a year means 26 times as many lies you have to tell.<br>  <br>  3) They want the money right away. The interest on all the tax revenue the government collects could run into the tens of billions of dollars per year. Letting people hold on to their money costs the government a lot.|`|MmTe8W8uaa	They do not return all of it to everyone.  They keep some of it.  They take temporarily, because they do not know from whom they will be keeping some of it and to whom they will be returning what was withheld.|`|KashRDx2aa	you file tax to pay tax. when they return is because you over pay tax. so it is your money in reality. Stick with H&R Block and you will learn more. Don't forget to put God first in your life.|`|AA10469473	Most people don't get all of what's withheld returned, and many don't get anything back..  <br>  <br>  I'm not sure you understand just what a refund is.  Through the year you might have money withheld from your paycheck for federal income tax.  At the end of the year, you prepare a form called a tax return to calculate how much tax you owe total for the year, and compare that to what was withheld.  If you had more withheld than your total tax, you get the extra back as a refund.  If you didn't have enough withheld, you have to pay the rest rather than getting a refund.|`|zuGKIWfNaa	They only take what YOU tell your employer to give them out of your paycheck.<br>  <br>  It's a given that you're going to owe the government a certain amount of money each year for taxes. For most people, the easiest way to pay this is to have their employer hold out a portion of that money for them each week. Then, at the end of the year, they do the paperwork to calculate exactly how much they should have paid the government. <br>  <br>  If they overpaid them during the year, they'll get back the extra. That's why the government "refunds" your money to you -- because YOU have chosen to give them TOO MUCH in the first place.<br>  <br>  (Sorry, that's only one reason. But that really is the only reason it happens.)

49740c9daeea677fc86801fb2b3f41deaa	Did you pay rent until you left?   The first notice counts.|`|LklBuVAXaa	To tell you the truth....all you can really do is sue him in small claims court.  Just tell the judge notice was given on the 1st as it pertained to your existing contract.  That's assuming you and your room mate were on the same contract.  Meaning....you were not on separate contracts.<br>  <br>  You didn't break your lease did you?  You can give 30 notice but still be obligated to fulfill the entire length of the contract.  For example...if I had a 12 month lease I can still put in a 30 day notice at 10 months in.  I would still be obligated for 2 months of rent.  A 30 day notice doesn't null your contract.  Fulfilling the length of the contract nulls your contract.  But the landlord has a legal duty to try to rent your apartment during vacancy.  He just can't sit on it for 2 months charging you rent.  He has to try to actively rent that apartment.<br>  <br>  The only way to get your money back is to sue him.  That's really the only way.

ZcFGa97Raa	lease options can be beneficial but very few every actually work.  the main reason is that there is a reason you can't buy the home now.  chances are, that reason won't go away in the next year.<br>  <br>  if you have a down-payment and 600 credit score you should be able to buy a the home with an fha loan.  if your credit is below 600 but with very good reason you could look at a seller finance purchase with your down-payment.<br>  <br>  another big problem is that a lease-option purchase doesn't spell out the purchase part of the contract, just the lease.  so when it comes time to purchase there are a lot of variables that may kill the deal and leave you without a home or your money.<br>  <br>  if you go with a lease option then write a purchase contract with the lease-option contract as an addendum.  that way all the details of the purchase and the lease will be in writing.  the terms can be changed down the road if necessary but you won't have any surprises.<br>  <br>  just be sure that the problems preventing you from purchasing right now, with amazing rates and low prices, can really be fixed before the end of the option to purchase.  good luck.|`|9b9f75545eba3c982f4a21bb3a585952aa	if you decide to go this route, PLEASE make sure you have it reviewed by a real estate lawyer.  I know tons of people who have gotten ripped off by people doing these sorts of deals.  Buyers have a habit of walking away from these deals with your money going along with them!|`|371b4dbc5cb2aaeddc0aed690aeae075aa	If I were you, I would first find out why the seller is putting out a lease option. Some sellers just want to sell it because they foresee not having enough money to continue paying the mortgage and trying out all possible options to sell it. Some sellers may just want to cheat your money. <br>  <br>  Pros of buying with lease options<br>  1. Let's assume you signed one year contract and you decided to put down $X dollar per month. At the end of the year, if the price of the real estate dropped more than $X x 12 months, you can always walk away from the deal and only loose a fix amount of money. You don't get stuck with the real estate and have to worry about selling it yourself.<br>  2. Because you are living there for a year or so already, by the time at the end, you know for sure if you love or hate living there. So if you hate it, you can walk away. Again, of course you are risking part of your down payment money.<br>  3. You have time to save up for your down payment or build up your credit score during the contract period.<br>  <br>  Cons<br>  1. This goes back to the pros number 1. If the price of the property went up dramatically, the seller still cannot change their mind and back out of the contract.<br>  2. I guess if you are not careful, the seller can potentially walk away with your money. (So to avoid, make sure you get your own agent).

Businesses that violate this or any part of their bankcard agreement may be dropped from the bankcard program.<br>  <br>  However, businesses are allowed by law to offer a discount for purchases made by cash or check. Check your bankcard agreement to see what it says regarding these transactions.<br>  <br>  The difference between a surcharge for credit (which is illegal) and a discount for cash (which is legal) is the advertised price—a retailer cannot charge a credit card customer more for an item than its advertised price.|`|zLKsBm1Uaa	Because of the bank charges.<br>  Do not go over over your limit on your debit card.<br>  If you do,the fees will shock you.|`|trrjxPxiaa	it's your bank that does that, when i signed up for an account, they told me that it was $.60 for a debit charge. so i just use my debit card but say "credit" and it doesn't charge you.|`|9b9f75545eba3c982f4a21bb3a585952aa	Yes, because the cost of processing transactions with a card are higher than with cash.  This is becoming a bigger trend with gas stations lately.|`|nD77wL5raa	Yes, when you sign up for a debit card its in the fine print.

Zs2lUCI4aa	Medical assistant is a little higher pay<br>  CNA is easier to get a job.|`|I2yzUID0aa	well it depends on what you enjoy. cna's are more clinical and hands on where medical assistants are usually half clerical/administrative. a medical assistants clinical tasks are usually limited to vital signs where a cna does a little more, ex bathing, dressing, etc. basically the dirty work. but some people like to do that. i believe a medical assistant will pay slightly more but like the other person said, there aren't as many m.a. positions as their are cna.
AA11284831	To e-file a return requires either the AGI from the original return last year or your self-selected PIN from last year.  A return cannot be e-filed without one or the other.  In cases of an amended return, the IRS requires the ORIGINAL INCORRECT AGI to e-file if you don't have your self-selected PIN.  This is a security measure to ensure that you are who you say you are.<br>  <br>  Without one or the other you cannot e-file and will have to mail in a paper return.|`|AA11357056	That might just be the number they've decided to use to make sure you're you when efiling... but you can get it by phone from the IRS if you need it.|`|klj3cOFPaa	They don't really "need" it, but they want it.  They want it because, just as a matter of procedure, they want to be able to cross-check this year's income against last year's, as a potential way of finding discrepancies in your original returns for both years.<br>  <br>  There is no good reason that they should prefer to have your original gross income--which was incorrect anyway--as opposed to your amended gross income, which was accurate.  My guess is that the internal IRS rules governing preparation of returns say, "We need original gross income, regardless of any amended returns," and that the regulations were written without much thought.  But the rule is what it is, and there's no benefit to you in fighting it.  Just give them the original gross and let it go.  It makes no difference to your actual tax liability for 2008 anyway.

They are a rip off. If you have bad credit go to a major bank ( recommend B of A or US Bank) and get a secured card. Yes, you will have to give a minimum of $300 to start the card, but they will give you your money back after one year of solid payment history and a switch from secured to unsecured.Plus the annual fee is just $29.

Learn calligraphy so that you can provide handwritten invitations and thank you notes to prospective wedding parties, birthday celebrations, etc. Seek out clients through wedding planners at nearby churches and temples. A starter calligraphy kit usually runs around $20 and anyone can easily pick up this skill. The going rate is usually $1 per hand addressed item.<br>  <br>  2. Seek from your neighbors a gardner position which involves planting, weed removal, plant/tree trimming, light brush clearance. You will be using the neighbor's equipment and tools. Again, do not represent yourself as a lawn mower since there are any number of safety issues involved. A door-to-door solicitation of surrounding neighbors is required and you can charge between $6 to $9 per hour.<br>  <br>  3. Offer policing/removal or clearance of trash services to surrounding neighbors which involve trash pickup within nearby residential area. Limit the extent of pickup to small areas and be aware that there are no hazardous terrain or elements involved in this process. Again, a door-to-door solicitation of neighbors is in order. You can charge between $6.75 to $7.50 per hour.<br>  <br>  4. Acquire a set of window cleaning tools [a bucket, liquid window cleaner, sponge, squeegee, handle with an extension and a small step ladder] and solicit local businesses for your window cleaning services. However, be careful to limit the height of the window cleaning to no higher than one story. Charge $1 per window panel.<br>  <br>  5. Visit your nearest beauty salon and ask to be trained as a shampoo person who is also willing to sweep up fallen hair on the ground and do set ups [arranging dye kits, curler holders, etc.] for a set hourly fee.<br>  <br>  6. Become a sign flipper by contacting your nearest realtor. A flipper is someone who stands at a major intersection and flips a "For Lease/Rental" sign in order to attract visitors to an open house or to a particular real estate listing. The hourly pay is at least the minimum wage.<br>  <br>  7. Why not become a paid feeder servicing the disabled at nearby nursing, convalescent, assisted living/care centers and hospitals. It involves feeding food to patients who are unable to feed themselves. The starting rate is $8.00 per hour. The only downside is that one has to take precautions to wash one's hands after each feeding. A posting of your services [by a business card or flyer] on a reviewable bulletin board would be enough to generate customers. The paid feeder position is one of the fastest growing occupation at this time.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|jcEtRUVZaa	Try some of these:<br>  <br>  How to Make Money as a Teenager<br>  <a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_4776508_money-teenager.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ehow.com/how_4776508_money-te...</a>|`|q74P5eGTaa	When I was 15 I hauled hay and worked in the kitchen of a local restaurant.

vQOFU4vCaa	How much do you pay for rent in "Downtown" Montreal? 10-15% being a hundred dollars sounds like it was $1000. I think i'm moving to Canada if you you live in the downtown of a major city for a $1000. Do you have a nice place? This isn't an answer at all... I live in Chicago and they raise my rent about 2-5% annually. Chicago I believe is shrinking though, so if Montreal is growing healthily that may be normal, but it sounds a little extreme. Go apartment hunting a month before the lease runs out. Most people hate it but you can make it fun day if you try. If you live in places that long without wanting to move why don't you buy? Go and talk to a lender to see what kind of loan you can get with your current monthly payments. If you stay in places that long I think it would be beneficial to be building some equity instead of just throwing your money away every month on a landlord. I don't know how hard it would be to sell and get a new place when your ready to leave but it is something to think about.
7B9a65xaaa	Having your credit limit lowered will only lower your credit score if your credit utilization goes up. So if you owe them $540 and your limit is $540 and it is your only credit card, your utilization is 100% which is awful. As far as closing the account on the basis of them lowering your limit, that would affect your credit history length which is also bad for your credit. I would pay it off and NOT CLOSE it especially if they are not charging you an annual fee. When the economy turns around they will increase your limit again. Don't worry|`|7QPv7ta7aa	About a third of your score is based on the ratio of credit card debt to limit.  If your limit goes down, the debt percentage would increase.  Carrying balances of more than 30% hurts your score, 50% takes a big bite, and 90% kills it.  If you don't carry balances on any credit cards, lowering the limit will make no difference to your score.<br>  <br>  Closing the account would further lower your overall limit.  Also, closing your oldest account would hurt your score.  Closed accounts still show on your report for about 10 years, but don't count as much in your score calculation.<br>  <br>  Many credit card companies are drastically lowering limits and increasing interest rates.  If the account doesn't have an annual fee, just leave the account open for now and use it every 6 months or so to keep it active.<br>  <br>  If you do opt to close the account, do it via letter and request written confirmation that the account is closed and 0 balance.  Keep this in your "forever financial" file.|`|u93oneUXaa	If you close your credit card account it only affects your score minimaly.. so I would close it out. Your credit card company will send you a letter that states you closed the account. Forward that to all three credit reporting agencies (equifax, transunion ... I forget the other one)|`|9b9f75545eba3c982f4a21bb3a585952aa	Both instances hurt your score but closing the account will hurt more.  Anytime your available credit goes down, so does your credit score.  When your limit got reduced that took one hit to your score.  By closing the account completely, you will take another hit because your available credit amount will decrease by another $540.  Best thing to do it to keep the account opened and paid off!

12VQ4ETcaa	The best answer to "why should we hire you?" is about what you will bring to the company, i.e. why you are the best person at that job.  Stress that you are detail-oriented and driven.<br>  <br>  The best answer to "why do you want this job?" is about why you personally want to work in government and in the legal field.  Say you want to give back to the community and you are fascinated with the law.<br>  <br>  Another really common question in government interviews is to give an example of a communication problem you had with a coworker, and what you did about it.<br>  <br>  It helps with nervousness if you write out your answers first so you are confident what to say.<br>  <br>  Good luck!
fSlZQzS4aa	You can file married or separate as you choose.  If you can be civil towards each other it is normally better to file jointly.  If you have a refund, it can be direct deposited to up to three accounts so you don't have to worry about one party taking everything and running.

One of those quicky accident lawyers that promise they don't get paid unless you do, they typically charge you 30 or 40% of whatever you are awarded.  I'd at least call a lawyer or two who offers free consultation to see what you are up against and go from there.|`|6fa363d8a5782d40fddf324ee4a4d3d5aa	The insurance company certainly would appreciate that.

They probably would at least put your resume on file until a position opened up.  But there's no guarantee that will happen anytime soon, especially in this economy.

Restraint for exams, blood draws, x-rays, etc as well was feeding, exercising, surgery assistance.<br>  <br>  3. I don't know how much they deal with reptiles.<br>  <br>  4. The main difference is large vs. small animal.  Large would consist of farm animals.  Small would be dogs, cats, pocket pets.  You yourself would *not* be doing any diagnosing or surgery.  You would need to assist in surgery (or at the least prep & monitor), so you need to get over the dislike quick or find another line of work.

If you buy in bulk, they're really really cheap (about 50 cents each), but people will pay up to two dollars for them (though $1 - $1.50 would prob. be best).  You can't buy anything tastier or more filling/satisfying on school grounds.

How much are your wanting to barrow. 20K down on a 60K loan is good.  On a 400K this is bad.   How long have you been employed at your job will also be a consideration. <br>  <br>  If I were you I wouldn't listen to all the crap, go find out for yourself.  a few inquiries on your credit per year is not a bad thing, a few every month is. <br>  <br>  Go to a larger bank and ask to be pre-qualified.  they will let you know exactly how much they will loan you. <br>  <br>  Here is a website I found that has some great information on home loans:  wwww.loan-tricks.com<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|fd5924c397f5b6b2236018882cccd4a7aa	Have you been listening to the news?

Save your money for a down payment while you take some time to improve your credit to at least 700.  Then you will be ready to buy.|`|u93oneUXaa	Very doubtful.|`|LI8Eu7rRaa	That's what got Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in trouble the first go round....called Subprime loans...fix your credit and get back to a bank that handling bailout money....|`|Kt6NAKtTaa	Well that depends on several factors. If you can be approved for an FHA loan then you have a much more realistic shot over a conventional loan. As well check your specific state and county to see if you qualify for any loan assistance programs or check the HUD website. Sure a lot of banks are not giving loans to poor credit right now but there are lenders who can help you at a decent rate. It would not hurt you to try to get your FICO score up to 620 which is considered the barrier between good and poor credit. Not everybody was foolish enough to buy a house that was $250,000 when they only made $30,000 a year with a 580 FICO score. How could the banks not see this coming.|`|FreZO3kvaa	during these times its seems doubtful to me... but give it a shot the worst you can get is a denial or No for an answer....

The ownership is broken up into thousand or millions of shares and sold to initially raise money for the corp, called an initial public offering (IPO).  You buy the shares because you expect the company to increase in value over time, making your portion of ownership more valuable.  Some companies pay out profit as dividends to shareholders, some reinvest it in the company to help make your ownership more valuable.<br>  <br>  Mutal funds are professionally managed portfolios of stocks.
