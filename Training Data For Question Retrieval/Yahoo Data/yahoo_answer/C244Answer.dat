1rLqqi4waa	Have you ever watched August Rush? Oh, that whole soundtrack makes me feel like me. Lol!    August Rhapsody is number 1.  Moondance comes in second.    Um, I love alternative music.  I think Ingrid Michelson speaks to my soul.    Oh, check out Crystal by Stevie Nicks, that's my personal theme song.

GrI8mCJyaa	Well, I can't give an opinion of 'the band', because I haven't heard them as a whole......but based on the video of just you playing guitar I can say that you definitely have much potential.  I was very pleased to see the use of non-standard chords and timing, and not the same ol'-same ol' riffing.   I can tell you are striving to write more progressive material and that is pleasing as well ( though some parts did drag a bit, perhaps there are other guitar parts to accompany them that weren't captured in this video).  I can only hope that the rest of the band also follows in this direction in their own parts.  Very nice start, keep it up and post more when you get the rest of the band in there.|`|5uvTte8Zaa	I added you on myspace.    I could picture the other instruments joining in as I listened.  Very b@dd@$$|`|7fEVNng5aa	Not a bad start at all. You seemed a bit timid in your playing, but I think you mentioned that you didn't have the song down yet. I'd be interested in hearing more. Have you looked into posting the song at LastFM? I don't think they impose the 10 minute limit like youtube.
TpG33NoWaa	Perhaps it becomes hard to keep reading 'yes' and 'no' as answers to any conceivable question.       Or, on the other hand, questions such as "What's ur favrut colour?" may take so much concentrated thought that your brain drains of blood, or whatever is inside it?    Like you, I feel dumb.  With me, however, this feeling is more general.       I feel dumb when a four-year-old asks me how old I am (I haven't enough fingers and toes to figure it out, sadly.),     I feel dumb when confronted by a six weeks old puppy, and     I need help when I am considering whether it is raining or not.|`|Z0Vds9oCaa	Oh yes I do.

AA11388151	Yes it was Alzheimers the doctor classfied it as that.  His body on the outside was young, but in the inside he was an old man Alzheimers is a mental disease thus it affected him inside(his brain, memory).  PS god i love that movie!! so sad yet so beautiful!  When hes a baby and she is walking him :'(... damn so sad...|`|edbc68b619100ee785d795f2749556b5aa	no he didn't as he got younger his brain was undeveloping, thus causing his lose of memory cause those memorys were being erased.|`|f8c5c19cb27ce51454af3ecf7d02fe43aa	he got dementia or alzheimers or something  wierd and ironic  yet makes sense|`|dbYeN3hlaa	yes u r correct..he had symptoms of Alzheimer's|`|9q3oJD86aa	When he was born he was still a kid on the inside, but on the outside he was growing younger. When he became a kid on the outside he was really an old man on the inside. So yes it is possible he had alzheimers from old age on the inside. Wow thats confusing.|`|XKtjEiEraa	Actually, they said that the doctor there thought it was dementia.|`|pktL0LZzaa	yes, you are right. He had alzheimers, he was an old person in a young body.|`|pbfGaJukaa	I agree with firefighter. However, it was also interesting the way the filmmaker's tied dementia to the onset of puberty. If you remember, Ben's dementia appeared at the same time Ben was getting pimples. A young person enters adulthood at the onset of puberty. Arguably, an old person exits adulthood at the onset of dementia. This is a movie that takes a METAPHYSICAL look at aging, therefore I think it is valid to say that the filmmakers were trying to show the similarities between being very old and being very young, and how adulthood is about gathering meaningful experiences and living without regret.     Looking at it purely PHYSICALLY, Ben's brain is shrinking into youth and a smaller brain has less room to store all the memories gained in adulthood. Its a question of decreasing volume. Pure and simple.

xF9JCIZnaa	It'll be fine.  6 Year olds don't take that stuff seriously.|`|WOPNuM97aa	personally i hated spirited away. but by all means a 5 year old is not going to question the existence of god just because there are cartoon monsters.|`|BMfUZj8qaa	yes, of course. In fact 5 is enough !    dvd4online|`|K1JGsa8Caa	No.  Young children tend to take little things that we skim over more seriously than we do.  Obviously, they don't get the moral conflictions that go on in films, but scary moments, the use of spirits and stuff may scare her.|`|4WC2TXlsaa	I think as long as there isn't alot of nudity, sex, cussing, and so on in the movie then it should be fine.  Now your sister may have questions afterwards and you just have to be able to explain certain things. Which that could be true for any movie.|`|MsAdiXpraa	i fully support the questioning of god part. they'll grow more by wanting to find their own answers than by simply settling with what you've hand them.    spirited away is the perfect movie to show a 6 year old. its absolutely beautiful. put on howl's moving castle for her 8th birthday|`|wHmgVhphaa	Do you really think hiding other ideas from a small child is the best way to teach them religion?|`|qytU8i16aa	I love that movie!! I watched it when i was bout 7... but I think it wasn't that scary.|`|S9jyc95jaa	There's no way a 6-year-old will start to question her religion after seeing that movie, don't worry.  It will just seem fairy tale-like.  I personally can't imagine the average 6-year-old questioning her religion at all.  That's a little too deep for most kids. :)
f07926461bdcfe322b6a09357c11df76aa	Guitar/bass is great; original, nice composition, great transitions. I'm not sure I like the drum beat chosen for the first :30 secs.   Assuming this was entirely composed by you, a musician of your aptitude should be able to find an equivalent drummer, bassist and vocalist. There may be a outlet for this but it wouldn't be as successful as if you had a band who could promote your album with live music (not to mention the contribution other musicians could make on the music). I suggest using this as a promotional track to lure other musicians. www.bandmix.com is a great site for networking.|`|zkFuXoNDaa	I love it!  My kind of music.  I saved it into my itunes!

GS20sIkMaa	Mike Vickers a flautist for Canned Heat|`|s7gWSqV5aa	I know Jimi Hendrix played the flute on some of his songs, but I'm not sure if he did at Woodstock.    Edit:  He actually played recorder on If 6 Was 9, which he did not play at Woodstock. The search continues...    Jethro Tull did not play at Woodstock.    Mike Vickers did not play with Canned Heat. I think I found your answer, though:    "In October the band [Canned Heat] released their third album, Living the Blues, which included their most well-known song, 'Going Up the Country'. Alan's Wilson's incarnation of Henry Thomas 'Bull-doze Blues' was almost a note-for-note copy of the original, down to Thomas's instrumental break on the quills which Jim Horn duplicated on flute. Wilson rewrote the lyrics with a simple message that caught the 'back-to-nature' attitude of the late 60s. The song went to  1 in 25 countries around the world (only reached  11 on the U.S national chart) and would go on to become the unofficial theme song of the Woodstock Festival as captured in Michael Wadleigh's 1970 documentary."  --Wikipedia (Canned Heat)|`|AA11703652	Was Jethro Tull at Woodstock?

In fact, that's what's happening just about every time you see a rainbow -- the sunlight is reflecting back to you from water drops.    I think you're less likely to see rain falling in sunlight in the middle of the day because rain falls straight down (unless the wind is blowing) and if it's falling from a cloud, the cloud will block the sun when the sun is near zenith (the point directly overhead). But early morning and late afternoon when the sun is shining from nearer the horizon, it's more likely to shine on rain falling from overhead.|`|ypqoFDSqaa	in Hawaii and Florida|`|8sMuQa7haa	Only when the bad moon's rising ...|`|zzivfC0qaa	Yes on multiple occasions, its the best.|`|FnxgmknUaa	all the time. its called a SUN SHOWER. and they are awesome!|`|zJF1J4R8aa	yes it happens all the time in florida|`|RugUki9qaa	Yeah, in the south|`|YE0baNYRaa	yeah. but its rare. it seems like a jazz and rock concert going on at the same time.

If this were the case, her emotional yin energies would blend very nicely with your Sag sun as a whole.    Her Venus in Aquarius shows that when it comes to romantic attractions, she's not attracted to the conventional but rather to more eccentric, unconventional characters of the free wheeling type. She is likely to appear emotionally aloof and relate on an intellectual level.     Look to your Mars and Venus Signs to see if they complement her Venus in aquarius. if u also have the mars in aquarius, then sexual attraction will be strong nonetheless.|`|HZxX9ke8aa	venus not really that important. say what's her ascendant and moon signs rather.|`|bxfInqBPaa	She's really a man.

OouH4y6maa	I am a fortune-teller. Can I have your birth place please. Can I have the location when you asked this question such as LA in the USA, etc. Thanks.  ....continue.............................  I assume you still live in Bombay right now. Reading your chart, it seems that you will not get this job. It may be because the company is in some kind of financial difficulties and would not able to hire any more new employee. And your current financial situation is closely related to your family. If you are still living with your family now, then your family's spending is more than the income. If you do not hear from that company in February, then you will not get the job. ( This is only my personal opinion. )|`|6fjMtWboaa	Well I'm not Pychic, but it's been a month.

I would personally suggest anything you can find from timbaland.   (come around, come and get me, bounce, release)    all of AC/DC's hit songs are great.  daddy yankee is amazing for adrenaline. (reggaeton music)  swiss beatz is an artist with amazing beats to get you going. (it's me snitches, big munny, untouchables, money in the bank)  there is a style of music called krump that is a branch of hip hop, check it out (especially the j-squad)    look up :    get buck in here (dj felli fel, akon, various)  i'm so hood, we takin over (dj khaled)  get it on the floor (DMX)  shipping up to boston (dropkicks murphys)  go hard or go home (E40)  red bandana, one blood, put you on game, superman (the game)  set it off (kardinal offishall, clipse)  let it rock (lil wayne, kevin rudolf)  all nite (janet jackson)  dirt off your shoulder (jay-z)  the potion, act a fool, stand up, number one spot (ludacris)  like this (marques houston, yung joc)    and of course, LINKIN PARK!    have fun working out!|`|a984cQjKaa	the best album i've found to work out to is "three cheers for sweet revenge" by my chemical romance.  it's got a fast tempo so you work out faster.

But I guess no.|`|w6mJ9MC0aa	money must grow on trees it sure didn't grow under bush|`|cshQIVwwaa	If you use a tree to make money, I would guess so|`|zb7Fd0qAaa	That's funny, and a clever answer!  However, US Dollars are mostly made out of cotton fibers and not paper from wood pulp.  So, there you go, money grows on plants.       You could take it a step further, and ask what 'grow' means...    From your description, it sounds like you are talking about paper/coin money, which doesn't grow at all.  It stays pretty much the same size from the time it is manufactured until it is destroyed.  Money is a just a finished product assembled from component parts, some of which originated in plant matter.  Paint and houses don't 'grow on trees', but dollars contain paint in their dye and a lot of houses are at least partially made of wood.  The point is not to confuse component pieces that might 'grow on trees' with the final product.     From a more philosophical aspect, consider the intrinsic value of money.  Money serves a few main purposes: it is a medium of exchange, a medium of storage, and a unit of measure.  Money does not physically grow in any of those senses.      People casually talk about making their money grow through investments, but what they really mean is that they are accumulating more money.  They do not mean that each individual dollar is becoming more valuable.      The only way that each dollar becomes more valuable is if there is a deflationary environment.  Deflation is the opposite of inflation, it is when prices are going down instead of rising.  When prices go down, each dollar is actually worth more... but the extreme of this situation is a wrecked economy with many bankrupted companies and high unemployment.  Not typically what we think of when we imagine 'growth'.      Money, or the value of it, grows in your mind.  When you are a baby money is meaningless to you, but when you are ready to retire or have a major life event it could be the most important thing.      Oranges, there's money that grows on trees.     Last point... does money grow 'on' trees.  Like, could I pin a dollar to a tree and tomorrow it will be twice as big, or will grow into two dollars?  In this economy its worth a try!
3qhgEppkaa	no|`|73ZquQVwaa	im 18 and im still a virgin.|`|a8qFkmSzaa	well im not 17 yet. im 14. im still a virgin and proud of it. im saving myself 4 marriage. i haven't had my 1st kiss yet but whateves. it'll happen when it happens.i think it's better to wait 4 the right person cuz if you sleep around with everyone you could get stds and all that crap.     hun it's ok. it will get better. it may not seem like it but it will. just think possitively.yeah a few days ago i was very very very unhappy. i know what it's like. you just have to do what makes YOU happy. like 4 me it was dying my hair and cutting it. it's wayy cuter and i feel better. so just do wat makes you happy. i know it duz suck at this age but it will get better eventually.|`|Z0Vds9oCaa	Do you honestly wonder why it is that you're a virgin?

I answered this about 15 mins ago.|`|FttPArZ7aa	YES. and most 15 year olds aren't vrigins anymore.  You shouldn't be embarassed.  At least your clean.|`|UsojaTuuaa	i was not a virgin at 17    i think you should probably talk to a friend/family memeber and seek professional therapy.|`|MA3KcLUJaa	Jeez.  This really show me what is important in life to guys.|`|70kJJJ7uaa	Relax! It will happen. Give yourself a fighting chance, for christs' sake!  You haven't even begun your life yet. Think potential...|`|YE0baNYRaa	yes of course|`|QQbbReRAaa	Lol, sounds like me at your age. Just go to a brothel and get the first one out of the way. I was 18 when I lost it. A friend of my brothers was 30 !?!, and he wasn't religious or anything like that. And yes, things do get better|`|w4LKvr0daa	yeah.    It's not that big of a deal.         I'd tell you that having morals isn't a bad thing, but seeing as you seem so desperate to lose your virginity, it doesn't seem to be a matter of morals.|`|AA12004569	Ah, for that suicide thing, you'll need to talk to a counselor. They can point you in the right direction. As for the virgin thing, well, I was 19 years old when I lost my virginity. It was on my wedding night, and I have never regretted waiting until I was married to give that part of myself away. If you think about it, it makes MUCH more sense to wait! There's no heartbreaks over people who you thought loved you, only to realize after the fact that they (or you) were only infatuated. There's no risk of sexually transmitted diseases or unwed mothers. There's no risk of getting a reputation for being cheap and easy. Why complicate your life by causing yourself all this trouble? Just wait until you find one who's actually worth giving your virginity up to!|`|qnBIXPx5aa	its ok am not going to have sex until am 18 cause i don't want to get pregnant or get an std or krabs  then get in hellu troble bye my mom|`|iIWWeD7Taa	You think you wanna kill yourself NOW, just wait til you're married.  Then you'll REALLY wanna jump off a fcukin bridge.|`|7CoVXfA1aa	Okay first of all there is nothing wrong with being a 17yr old virgin. I was a virgin at 17. Don't be in such a hurry to lose your virginity, it can be the more mature thing to wait until you find someone meaningful to share it with. (I know it's hard hearing others say this but it honestly is better).You know a lot of people at high school will lie about their virginity anyway, to look cool etc. There are probably a lot more virgins than you think!  The suicide contemplation is not cool at all - you need to talk to someone about it (your parents, a trusted friend, a councilor). Things will get better. Being a teenager is one of the hardest times of your life, so many pressures on you, your body's busy changing and your hormones are all over the place! (I once heard a parenting advice coach say that teenagers are literally not right in the head, when I looked back at my teenage years and all the things I had going on, I realised he was probably right!). Suicide is really a selfish decision, think how many other people you'd screw up if you did and about how many people don't get the opportunity to live, like you do (my Dad died of stomach cancer last year). Don't waste your life! (And for that matter don't let those people who make you feel like that win).  I had never even had a boyfriend until I was 17 and that didn't last too long (he was a dick!) and he was the only boyfriend I had at high school. (Btw I am now happily married with a son, where some of the 'popular' kids at school who seemed to have it all then are still single, so life does change once you leave high school).  I know high school years can be hard but stick it out and I'm sure things will get better...a positive attitude will go a long way towards this :-)|`|juraRlbkaa	Uh..okay..not a big deal. Don't rush your self. You'll regret it later.|`|9gRikg8Kaa	no....i had attempted suicide a few times. but i was saved.     things will get better.|`|EiX4L2xQaa	No i lost mine at age of 10-12?|`|pBlgXJusaa	Yes and it's not really embarrasing unless you want an STD so young|`|RdD4M1ddaa	The best answer : ISA !!! 10 points !!!

rNqF4gIVaa	Of all the great composers, Schumann is perhaps one of the most misunderstood. A man of immense talent but frail mental health, his music is idiomatic of the romantic period. His piano music in particular is very personal and at times highly quirky or peculiar, but always very personal. He was a big fan of Chopins music, but the feeling was not mutual... Chopin thought Schumann's music was weird.  Listening to Schumann piano music tends to create the impression that it is a conversation intended for a single listener and it varies from odd to grotesque to exquisite. Much of it is rather sad and perhaps as much is quirky. Much has been made of Schumann's bipolar personality and it may be this feature of the composer that created this characteristic.  Many are highly critical of the orchestration of his larger works and this may be warranted, but I find his symphonies strangely satisfying for reasons I have yet to discover.  He is perhaps the least easily acquired of the great composers, so stick at it. Make sure you listen to:  Carnaval, Kreisleriana, his wonderful piano concerto, his Fantaisie Op.77 and all of his symphonies but especially No.3 "Rhenish".    Good luck.|`|xcPzZvsraa	In my humble opinion his Overture to Manfred is his orchestral masterpiece bar none.  Of course it's all a matter of taste but despite my repeated attempts to appreciate them I feel the four symphonies quite simply can't bear scrutiny with those magnificent specimens by Brahms.  I think his first instinct to leave the Symphonic form alone in the wake of Beethoven was the right one.  It is also worth remembering that it dosen't naturally follow that all of the great composers were strong in every compositional field(I personally think Beethoven's failing came within vocal music).  I am being rather harsh no doubt as regards Schumann's symphonies which contain many fine moments especially the third but as a whole they just don't affect me on an emotional or spiritual level the way Beethoven,Brahms,Mahler and the like do.    On the other hand I feel the same way for Brahms early piano music.  Conversely however I feel this is where Schumann really shines.  These piano works in particular -  Fantasia in C,  Kreisleriana,    Fantasiestcke  Kinderszenen.(which includes "Tr?umerei" or "Dreaming")  P.S The Cello Concerto is also amazing as has been noted.|`|ItOBf6Ojaa	Traumerei is probably the best. Carnaval & papillons are ok but not THAT interesting. He also wrote some very good pieces at the lower level, in the Album for the Young. In particular, The Happy Farmer & The Wild Horseman. They're quite catchy.     I prefer Chopin, Brahms & liszt as they have many more interesting pieces to choose from. They have catchy motifs that stay in your mind. Perhaps Schumann didn't have the inspiration/motivation the others did. He had to write music because he couldn't play anymore.|`|18a395b4522ca8e709ab2516888825c5aa	I prefer his piano pieces to his orchestral works. Since he was a virtuoso pianist himself, he would naturally be an excellent composer for that instrument. I think, at times, that his scoring and phrasing in his orchestral pieces can be a bit awkward.    I love Carnival and Davidsbundlertanze. His Abegg Variations and his Kreisleriana are also good.    [edit for Dr. John]    You're mean, but thanks for correcting me.    Some of his orchestral works are certainly worth listening to. His orchestral preludes "Manfred" and "The Bride of Messina" are great.|`|f8580fb10a70074a6148e666b97f9cdaaa	There is a wonderful CD including his piano works Carnaval Op.9 and Kinderszenen Op. 15 , performed by Cristina Ortiz , which is really an amazing performance, you'll not regret getting it.  Other beautiful Schumann works, his songs with piano, I really love his soprano song "Mignon (Kennst Du Das Land)"  Other interesting works :  -Overture, Scherzo and Finale Op. 52  -Fantasie-stuck Trio  -Introduction and Allegro appassionato, Op. 92  -Introduction and Concert-Allegro in D minor, Op. 134  -Violin Concerto in D minor.|`|obGQ2Bqfaa	Schumann has a particular affinity with the cello. his best works are those which use this instrument.    [ edit for Mellotro]    Schumann was unable to play the piano owing to a problem with one of his hands, he therefore took up the cello...i suggest that you stick to subjects where you know something !|`|tuATxHsVaa	Well I can start you off by telling you that he worked as a music critic. His wife Clara Schumann was also a fine composer and pianist.    Brahms frequented his home, and some think that Clara and Brahms may have briefly fallen in love. Or perhaps it was just Brahms that fell in love with Clara.    Anyway, Schumann also went a bit crazy. He kept hearing 440 A in his ears.    Schumann's "Konzerstck" Op. 86 is a golden standard of the symphonic repertoire. It's right up there with works from Beethoven, Mozart, Brahms, etc. It is a concerto for 4 horns.    People that say he was a bad orchestral composer just haven't given him a chance.    And now some links.    Listen to the exposition from his 3rd Symphony in Eb Major:    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSHL-OcE8...    And the grand Konzerstck (who doesn't love this piece?? It is perfect in every conceivable way):    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4dtVsYoN...|`|jgEvnYNlaa	You state you do not know much about him but his music bores you? What pieces bore you?   Listen to the Adagio from his Second Symphony. If that bores you then IMHO it's a question of you broadening your listening horizon.   I realize it comes down to personal taste.   Other composers have trouble with the structure of some of his works. For instance Mahler re arranged and re orchestrated all of his symphonies.   However, his Fantasy for piano his considered a masterpiece by just about every great pianist.  It is very difficult to play by the way.     Least we not forget his Piano Concerto? Just about every pianist worth their salt recorded it. It was influential to many composers.   Keep listening and you will become a fan like myself.

kbFty6eVaa	I'll be frank. Your playing is extremely stiff. It's no surprise to me that you're developing tendonitis. This injury is a result of unawareness of correct piano technique, which requires the attention and maintenance of a teacher, coupled with what may be poor practice habits.    You are playing level 4-5 pieces, but you are playing them very well in terms of musicality. You appear to have a high musical aptitude. However you need a teacher to show you the correct physical technique, and you will notice "wow, before I was in a different world" once you begin lessons. You also have to make sure the teacher is a GOOD teacher.|`|FCFdYuchaa	confirm  http://classical-piano-guide.blogspot.co...|`|tuATxHsVaa	You are performing pieces around the grade 5 level. Let's be realistic about this; this music isn't exactly as demanding as a Mozart Sonata (level 6 and 7, etc.) or nearly as demanding as Beethoven Sonatas (8, even 10, etc.).    You are definitely hovering around level 4-5. I say this to everyone - but I think you should get a teacher. Spending 8 hours a day should have brought you a lot of skill and ability. I don't think you were necessarily wasting your time learning everything on your own - but I do think that a teacher would have been a great asset.     Your playing is very lovely.|`|WPWGPaIyaa	i think your really good! :]|`|ItOBf6Ojaa	I'd say you're about a level 4 or 5. I can't really tell for sure because your songs are all slow. You can tell if you're a definite 5 if you can play quickly & evenly, do bigger jumps, etc. Also, if you want to compare to real levels, you have to compare yourself to conservatory standards. You have to have the same aural level & sight reading level. When someone just learns for fun, they usually don't train those but they still say "oh i'm level ____" but it's not really that level.     The style & dynamics are quite good though, and I think pedaling is ok as well. I think your technique is fine.

fmiGBNTLaa	I don't think that the age difference would be the reason to say that you are taking advantage of her. You have stated that you don't love her, you love what she does for you... does she know that? If you are being open and honest with her then no I don't think that you are taking advantage of her.|`|tK5swgX1aa	Yes, she is young and sounds smitten. You could break her heart and it sounds like you're taking advantage of her. What do you mean by she does everything for you? Is she cleaning up after you and having sex with you? You should do more in this relationship too. A lot of younger women have low self esteem and believe doing everything for a man is all they deserve. Just be careful she isn't being used.|`|jplrg1oJaa	Yes, you are taking advantage of her unless you have very clearly communicated to her that you do not love her. If she just loves being with you and you love being with her and both are on exactly the same page when it comes to the relationship and what to expect from it, then you would not be taking advantage. However, if she doesn't know you don't love her, and expects the relationship to lead places you don't want to go, and you have not told her otherwise, then you'd be a jerk - and yes, taking advantage of her.    If you just like bossing her around and that's the only reason you're spending time with her, that is rather low. Unless she liked being bossed around and fully recognized what you were doing.     Though if you took her virginity on false pretenses, shame on you. A submissive woman can be very rewarding with the right dominant man, but only if both parties are in full consent and both know precisely what is going on.    Age doesn't really matter as long as both are adults. However, she may not even realize she is being taken advantage of, so the other person being willing isn't always relevant. Maybe she has self esteem issues and you play upon that and she does everything you want because it makes her feel like maybe she's not so bad after all. This doesn't help her - she should not be with someone just because she does what they want, she should be with them because they accept her for who she is and she likes spending time with them.   IF that is the ONLY quality that you think she has, then it's a very terrible foundation for a relationship.|`|Ethykzkoaa	oh man, I kept reading you were 12 years old.  Please, please be careful with her heart.  I had a man 12 years older than me( freaky huh?) who wanted to "date" me when I was 16.  He repeatedly told me he loved me but ehn did things to me I didn't want him too.  I am forever scarred and am afraid of love because I don't believe anyone can love me and men only want me for my body.  So, please, please be careful. It seems you already had sex with her and you were her first. Tread lightly, do not break her heart.  Edit: you don't love her... you are going to hurt her so abd no matter what you do. You are taking advantage of her completely.|`|4W8fHj5Gaa	Yes you are. I doubt she knows that you dont love her, just her lady parts. If you cant bring yourself to love her somehow, like the sound of her voice, or how she thinks, then I think you might have to break it off to avoid from using her anymore.|`|Ua7kJ6Tzaa	Pedophile....|`|zQQd2wPRaa	you are 12 years old and having sex? you are awful!|`|2epeZrOGaa	Stop wasting her time|`|Aj2iJZXJaa	Yes, you are taking advantage of her! If you have a doubt in your mind about this then you obviously are taking advantage of her other wise you wouldn't of even thought of it!|`|Ectn7tkSaa	It is because you said you don't love her...that is what makes the difference!  Plus she says that now but later on she will think differently.  Everyone is different at the beginning of the relationship and will do anything to please the other person but later on you think back and may feel differently.  What you described does not sound like a healthy long-lasting relationship.  You haven't mentioned doing things for her in return...relationships should be equal with giving and taking.  Maybe she has low-self esteem which makes her think she is happy doing everything for you just so you will stay with her.|`|ambc6Q6Raa	how old are you guys????|`|qYm40x0yaa	u know the answer to ur own qn  some ppl dont have a backbone  and ur gf doesnt have one  she will let u walk all over her  if u dont love her  then u shudnt play with her emotions like that  does she know that u dont feel the same way that she does?|`|FttPArZ7aa	YES you are taking advantage of her.  You ***.|`|AA11369490	yes you are!|`|uJNrsYpqaa	yes|`|70kJJJ7uaa	Hmmm.   I think you already know the answer to this one.. And you know where this is going to end up if you continue. If you care about someone.........set them free.|`|f5RzWf1Gaa	you are taking SO much advantage, she thinks she's so in love she's in denial. you are in the wrong-she is so much younger-which doesn't matter so much (hoping you're BOTH adults) you're not in love with her but you are treating her like a slave. stop. let her go. you already took her virginity. don't take away her whole life :(    ADDED: holy crap she's 18?!?!?!??!?!? YOU TOOK HER VIRGINITY AND YOU DON'T LOVE HER YOU ARE USING HER SHE IS STILL SO YOUNG AND CONFUSED    she is really confused and maybe had a bad home or doesn't know what love is etc. please even if it hurts her it's best for the BOTH of you, weather she know it or not!!!|`|w4LKvr0daa	Did she specifically say she loves "what (you) have"? As long as she specifically said that and not that she loves *you* then there's a pretty good chance that you're both on the same page. Hence no advantage is being taken.    But if she is in love with you, you're a horrible person. Seriously.|`|R1rVPOdGaa	Dude, please tell me she is over 18.|`|WxWadsfxaa	yes. yes. yes. period.|`|zzivfC0qaa	I have already answered and I have to say you ARE taking advantage of her by allowing her to do everything you want. Poor naive girl!|`|xy4z8bQraa	if you think you are then most likely you are, do you feel guilty?|`|SY5JQX69aa	you shouldnt be having sex period.|`|sYyNyjwuaa	Why not try loving her back...?    You probably do, just wouldn't realize it until she's gone.|`|54hVzylRaa	You're a pig. I mean a P-I-G!|`|Ssv6UqmJaa	I think you're taking her love for granted. If you continue to do that, ur just going to end up making her bitter. I went through the same thing... If you don't care about her, maybe you should just remain friends. If it's because you're scared of the age difference don't be, it's really not that intimidating...

Adam was unhealthy because all of the "tricks" that Adam and Kyle can do take a toll on their mind and body.  Tom Foss is the guy who knew Adam well and always looks out after Kyle and the Traggers.  He started to look after Adam when he got sick, but Adam died in last night's episode.  To Kyle it's as if his father died.  Adam was his mentor.

1DT7OUuHaa	Because they are the Gosselins of course!  That other family (the ultra conservative, religious one with like 17 kids) got to feed all the animals on a "personal" tour as well!  Both families (especically the Gesselins) have made a lot of money off these shows.  What upsets me is that the whole point of "Jon and Kate Plus 8" was that it was SUPPOSED to be about the day to day antics and struggles of trying to manage all these young children (6 which are the same age) but now they  1 bought a mansion and  2 have tons of hired help so Jon and Kate don't have to do all that stuff anymore like cook and clean.  That's not right!  I don't even think Jon works anymore.  I'll still watch it though 'cause I think it's funny how Kate nitpicks every little thing that Jon does or says, lol!|`|24cde8bf3f4cbca12a1379054950f95aaa	because no one wants to be around those 8 brats and their exploitative parents|`|JGjpc7Itaa	They are celebrities now.

The Jon and Kate plus 8 show must get paid to do that show......and undoubtedly receive incredible support from every name brand specific to children (Johnson&Johnson, Carters, Huggies, etc).  8 children and a wife could never live the lifestyle that they do on what he makes alone, and he appears to work very parttime as he is home doing the show most of the time.  He calls himself an ' I T ' and suspect that would be computer related.

sVdQSMvJaa	The only one who is ready for a serious relationship/marriage commitment/motherhood is Jillian.    Naomi is a HOT MESS!!  Her and Melissa's families are going to ruin for them.  Molly thinks giving it up is going to secure her a ring.      Please please let it be Jillian!|`|9rLi9pSRaa	I like Jillian too but i think it will be Molly all the way.  He loves to kiss her and he closes his eyes when he does and you know what that means.  He is into her.  She knows it too.  Jillian might be too immature and not ready for a relationship yet.  Melissa looks ready and they looked really good together at his place last night.  Naomi is too weird so she is out for sure.  About Deanna ,no way Jose!   He tried that one and once is enough. She is a bit peculiar as we all have seen and for her to pick the snowboarder without a job was irresponsible for a woman today. She isn't a teenager and she is trying to act like one in a woman's body.  Sad.|`|FBz0iIUXaa	I can't stank Jillian or Naomi. I like Melissa the best!|`|Tz7NeDWcaa	Im not liking Jullian actually. I feel as if she doesn't want him as much as the other girls. That scares me because I want him to be happy. I think it is either Melissa or Molly. All of the girls scare me at this point but interviews say he is happy.|`|dWeHChwwaa	JILLIAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!    i dont know why, but im not really a fan of Naomi's... she's beautiful, but eh|`|l3ZUVqB7aa	People already know who won the show      Spoiler  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83d8e3hNo...|`|AA11608168	I love Mel!!!|`|BMfUZj8qaa	itisgood|`|vuCo9wZZaa	I'm between Jillian and Molly; I agree that sometimes Jillian doesn't seem as into Jason as the other girls.  And Naomi, she's not ready for all of this, so I think she should be out, although he does like the dark hair/dark eyes combo.|`|wNqvcNpGaa	Naomi is a flight attendant-what type of mom would she be? She is not home on a regular basis.  Melissa still really does not know why she is there. Molly I can't figure out, but what if her parents disapprove of him, then he is out!! Jillian I think is the better person for him.

I hope this is it.  email me at bradwheat1977@yahoo.com if it is. thanks    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98QDqxo9K...|`|ab250551cde4aadbf54a0fea8a7b14e1aa	Wee Sing in Sillyville (1989)  One day, two kids named Scott and Laurie and their basset hound Barney are magically transported into a coloring book! This coloring book is a mystical, magical land called "Sillyville." While there, the kids meet up with Sillywhim, a happy, sing-songy lady who tells them of Sillyville's troubles. The Yellow Spurdurgurgles, Blue Twirlypops, Green Jingleheimers, and Red Bittybooties are all fighting because they do not wear the same colors! Scott, Laurie, and Sillywhim meet up with all of these coloful characters, plus a talking tree, a singing acorn, and the kindly purple-wearing Pasha who all sing songs about themselves. Will the kids and Sillywhim be able to reunite all of the people of Sillyville? You can bet your magic rainbow blower on it! There's also an old Irish song about Michael Finnegan that you might rememer and it goes something like this:    There was an old man named Michael Finnegan  He had whiskers on his chin-igan  They grew out and they grew in-igan  Poor old Michael Finnegan! Begin again...    There was an old man named Michael Finnegan  He went fishing with a pin-again  Caught a fish and threw it in-again  Poor old Michael Finnegan! Begin again...

KWqZe31Haa	Most likely it means more then just watching movies. But, it depends on how old you are and what your history with this girl is. If you guys flirt and she seems into you, go in for a kiss and see where that takes you. Don't be expecting to go much further, because a kiss is romantic and you don't want to come off as a pig. She may want to be romantic with you but not see that your only in it for sex. Hey, but if the kiss leads to more and she's comfortable, go for it. YOU have to make the move though. If it's on take it, and if you don't you will regret it..trust me. -Fig|`|ypqoFDSqaa	Depends on how far you have gone already with her. Probably .|`|Lm5jBGADaa	No lol that means just watching movies...sorry no nookie that night!|`|AA10718199	depends but if your still young, lets just keep it for movies|`|sLGlL17naa	You're sick! Jokes. It could mean watching movies.. with a little extra on the side ;)|`|XkkY2Lw0aa	Sorry, I think she just means a movie night, especially if you guys aren't even into that yet, unless you guys are already close enough to understand what it means when one invites another to a "movie night".|`|D5ZePDBkaa	Put a helmet on that soldier.|`|f1i6DPHFaa	It all depends on the girl.|`|yoAcz6GLaa	depends on the mood man.

di43MlSFaa	Joe Cocker sang the theme song, his take on the Beatles, "With a Little Help from my Friends"....    This is a link to the complete 5 disc CD set listing all the songs ever played on the show.  http://www.amazon.com/Music-Wonder-Years...    It was a good series and some great music too! (yes, I'm old enough to remember...lol).    Wait...there's more.   http://www.amazon.ca/Wonder-Years-Variou...    The only song that I can think of with some of those words is, "In my Life" by the Beatles, but that's not what you're looking for. It's not listed on the soundtracks.    Hope some of the listings will help though.    Edit:  I came across this link that someone has put together with as many of the songs remebered from each episode of the show, although the list is incomplete.  I've looked up the lyrics to most and can not find the specific ones you're looking for.  http://web.sfc.keio.ac.jp/~t93272at/Wond...    This site lists seasons 1-6 with each episode and music from each.  http://www.wonderyearsguide.com/category...  The only song that seems to come close  in the episodes was 'In My Life' sung by Judy Collins.|`|GS20sIkMaa	I can only find  I remember by Sarah Brightman..with lyrics similar.
Bve1SCP1aa	That episode was called "My Half-Acre"    Turk forms an air-band with the Janitor, Lloyd and Ted, but their band comes to an abrupt halt when Turk disobeys Kelso's orders, and Kelso subsequently bans air-banding. Though Turk tells Kelso he will obey his orders, Kelso doesn't reverse the ban. The Janitor then tells Turk that it wasn't about Turk not doing what Kelso asked him to; it was about Turk being disrespectful to Kelso. Turk apologizes to Kelso who then reverses the "no air-banding" ban.

2GMdTj3aaa	the one with the lesbians|`|gb9ERmHPaa	Oh that was the one where there was lesbians in it I think.|`|d9e367846b5ba5a880e1207e0d7a113baa	It was in season 1 or 2. I remember that series of episodes, at least I think it was more than 1. The mother is that prissy client that gets Shane to come to the house for a personal appointment and they mess around instead of doing her hair. (The husband thinks the wife looks great) Then the dad has the daughter go with Shane for some "motivation". The girl ends up falling in love with Shane. Somehow the daughter walks in on Shane and the mom. That's when everything blows up and Shane loses her chance at that salon.
HGfUY3lbaa	dont listen to the girl about jim morrison and the doors as much as i love them the song is not about that  don has stated in interviews that it is manily about buddy hollys death  which is some one he had been influenced by. basicly when he says when he says on the day the music died reffers to the end of the golden age of rocken roll in the 50s with the death of buddy hollys plane crash elvis going in to the army|`|qI9VCuhZaa	Its about the death of Jim Morrison from The Doors.|`|Coi21Fhcaa	like when it ended and how a certain point in time is over for them  heres madonnas version  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfdkMydCU...|`|8FrPKWiXaa	The music died when Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens and the Big Bopper died in a plane crash.|`|s7gWSqV5aa	"The song is an abstract story of his life that starts with the deaths of Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens, and J. P. Richardson (The Big Bopper) in a plane crash in 1959, and ends in 1970; in the song he called the plane crash 'the day the music died.'"  --Wikipedia    Jim Morrison died after the song was recorded, so his death has nothing to do with it.
sbJCyPtlaa	I wonder the same thing too , i think it would be because casey doesn't deserve to be acknowledged as a person , so her name just shouldn't be said|`|9e2edc13bc584b5dbeead19cad26ffb1aa	I wish I knew the answer too. She has been doing this since the beginning of this case and it's kind of annoying.|`|hKy1blrqaa	The point of that is simple. The case itself is about Caylee, not Casey. So it's about the tot, and that makes Casey the tot mom. Btw, I watch Nancy Grace every night, i love her show, and this whole story about Caylee is soooo sad.|`|ae5b94582952d6bd5e0f06acc5f5bf04aa	A child is referred to as a TOT ....she is the tot's mom .HOwever , I wouldnt exactly call her a MOM ...anyone can give birth , it takes someone special to have the title of a mom . a real mom would not be in the predictament shes in right now nor would they wait a month to say their child was missing .|`|yaaNbLeyaa	My guess is because Casey and Caylee sound too much alike and "Tot Mom" is catchy sounding and easy to remember (you did!).  I also think she's being deliberately ironic since Casey was anything but a "mom" to the tot.  What a sad story.|`|wybNxsu1aa	Idk either, she sounds like an IDIOT.

yRE2HDr3aa	NIN is overall better but both bands new material is boring to me. 1989 - 1995 NIN is the best.

I used to really love Manson. After Mechanical Animals i kinda lost interest though.|`|Lngb8ryFaa	NIN is probably technicaaly better as far as musicianship, singing ability, etc...but i choose manson as far as the overall package goes--controversy, shock rock, good songs, a big F*ck you attitude, etc...|`|VhxiFt8Caa	NIN|`|ckOvHnxUaa	definitely NIN.|`|8Z7Nnr8zaa	that's like asking do you want peanut butter or jelly?! they're both equally awesome!!    if i HAD to choose...

Just like in Olympics, you have plenty of participants from USA, China and Russia, who, with their large no. of participants collect heaps of medals (of course because the participants are competent too), similarly, India and China have so much population (and assuming the people are equally good all over), you can have a majority of the Indians and Chinese there!!

Even if you were 200 pounds overweight with a little hard work you could lose it in 2.  People...  Come on.  Cut ten years?  think about how much you can accomplish in ten years.      in ten years you could...    Finish a phd or law degree from scratch.  start and open a multimillion dollar business.  find a cure for cancer  write 10 novels  explore the entire world  build your dream career  create a charitable organization  Do anything....

ZcTW0fY2aa	18.    Because if by 18 we're old enough to go into the army, then we should be able to drink booze. But nobody really follows it anyways.    Haha.|`|jFHZo7pGaa	18 should be the age. You are driving, are considered a legal adult, and can be drafted into the military, yet you can't drink. Humm...? sounds off to me!|`|Om4oZd3Vaa	It should be lowered in the U.S. to 16 or 18.  Not because I'm 16 and want to drink (beer tastes funky), but because our society makes such a big deal of drinking that teens naturally are drawn to it.  It's the whole mentality of "It's illegal so it must be good" kinda thing.  Just look at Europe.  Theirs are younger and they don't have as much of a problem.|`|SUzn3qfzaa	Yeah it should be 21.

I'm 22 ha ha|`|AA10329469	18-19 should be fine as kids are more mature for  their age now than before.|`|b0hSQRasaa	well when i was 18 i bitched and moaned about how it should be eighteen. but i think that 21 is a respectable age. you should know enough by then to drink responsibly.|`|PeI3umPbaa	It should be lowered to 18|`|8sMuQa7haa	Conception.|`|2KI7LxUXaa	12...    dood come on. many kids drink and if you try to keep it away it will become one of those things....|`|Yb72J5zDaa	21 is a good age but if you have served in the military the age should be lowered to 18 for them.

9UhoUcM2aa	I know seriously! You didn't have to tell me that, I already knew
jNGdtQDSaa	Not true, New Moon will be an independant movie.  There were also rumours about Vanessa Hudgens (from High School Musical) auditioning for the part of Leah Clearwater, also not true.  I don't think they should do scenes of the Cullens when they are away from Forks because the point is that Bella can't see them anywhere, it's supposed to give the feeling of total absence, as if they were never coming back. If there were scenes of them it would ruin the effect.|`|MMmv06Ynaa	Eclipse and New Moon are going to be 2 seperate movies. There are many false rumors about Twilight all ova the place.|`|h6STVsR1aa	New Moon is by it self!!!! but i hope they do the 2nd part from breaking dawn to a new movie and the 1st part of breaking dawn with eclipse but then...they want the wait of the marriage and all that i guess.|`|4x2KMVbBaa	That is totally FALSE. They are being filmed back to back, but not in the same movie. That only means when they finish New Moon, they're going to start filming Eclipse as well. SO, NO, it's not gonna be combined!|`|qlgti3wKaa	No. New Moon, it alone, is beginning filming on March 23rd, I believe. New Moon hits theaters November 20th, 2009. Eclipse will be a separate movie.     *Ashley Greene (who plays Alice in Twilight) said in a recent interview that New Moon and Eclipse might be filmed back to back, because vampires don't age, and the actors, obviously, are aging. It's not confirmed, though, just a rumor for now.|`|jLvlcoFBaa	Two separate films.    New Moon to be released November 20th, 2009.    Eclipse coming in 2010.
bajnzy4maa	I'm sure I have a good answer for this, it's just not coming to me yet.|`|Gznvci2baa	A. 25                                    Q. what's a fulcrum?|`|vvbhO88maa	The answer is easy if you take it logically. Subtract 25 from the circumference of the gnome's head add 12 to the width of the gnomes hat, multiplied by 4 or 7, depending on the color of the jacket the gnome is wearing. Add 2 for every degree of nonsense this question has, divide by 6, add another 2 to each additional gnome in the garden, and add 7 just because I like seven, and your answer will be that a fulcrum is a hinge and like every other hinge on a gnome you come out with 56. Don't ask me to do your homework again, because I'm not. This is the last time.

If Warner Bros. is smart, this should stay in the archives, never to appear anywhere again.|`|4Pk6VNftaa	Oh man what a horrible show that was.  First they ditched half of the original crew, and second, they made Scrappy-Doo the main character.    The...horror....

vvpiYDqSaa	If that really is you singing, (take my scepticism as a compliment if it is...), You are wasting your time with this YouTube thing... but then again others have be discovered off it so good luck.    Got no ideas for getting your video rated as I hate You Tube.. but that is an awesome voice and you have a good stage presence so you should just get out there and audition, audition, audition. Get yourself into a music course or something, but don't let that talent go to waste.|`|1ol2eMjXaa	You should audition for a broadway or off-broadway show...sounds very theatrical.|`|eJjMbnc5aa	Wow you are amazing.

Your intonation and phrasing are nice, your chest tones impressive. You might do better with a stand mike to free your hands, since you do use them. If you can, do another take on a stage in front of the curtain with more theatrical lighting.    Keep working, do little theater, drama club, community, summer stock, whatever there is. Your voice is big enough. Break a leg.

24e3c53ff3387eb84f27768983042d80aa	This is the 10th million time someone has asked this, but I will answer nonetheless and I hope you do give me the ten points.    She didn't leave she was fired with an open letter, she would had left anyway to pursue her solo career, so Dark Passion Play (which would had probably had another name) would have been her last album with the band.    Here are the links to the open letter the band wrote, and her letter in return.    Band's open letter;  http://nightwish.com/en/article/6    Tarja's letter;  http://tarjafans.deviantart.com/journal/...    I personally don't take side because I don't fully believe either side, they can be lying or leaving things out, I don't care because trully whatever issues they had was their personal problems and not the public's. Maybe the band could have fired her in a different way or at least waited the day after the concert to give her the letter, but they did what they thought right and what's done is done, it's going to be 4 years since it happened.    I don't know if you like Anette but I hope that you are not one of those who bash on her for no reason, it wasn't her fault about what happened, the band choose her, they wanted a change in vocals and not a replica of Tarja.|`|Gznvci2baa	He cheated on her!!

5tl1uLgVaa	I haven't owned a Number 5 yet but I do love trying it on when at Macy's :)  I have Chanel Chance and a 100ml bottle was $110 and its definitely worth it. Any Chanel fragrance is worth the sticker price. And my Chanel stays on for HOURS. I can smell it even when I take a shower, I recommend getting the Eu de Parfume, it's more concentrated.    Also, Chanel Number 5 have a very mature scent to it. Younger people tend to think of it as an "old lady" perfume, but its not, Its a lovely scent.  Go for it! It doesn't hurt to splurge now and then :D|`|9SI9j221aa	I, My Most Royal Frumpiness, find it to be a timeless classic!|`|8sMuQa7haa	It is great with tonic and a splash of lime.|`|AA11536708	It is a classic.

ZwYt2LNuaa	Come On Get Higher by Matt Nathanson    I miss the sound of your voice  And I miss the rush of your skin  And I miss the still of the silence  As you breathe out and I breathe in  If I could walk on water  If I could tell you what's next  I'd make you believe  I'd make you forget    So come on, get higher, loosen my lips  Faith and desire and the swing of your hips  Just pull me down hard  And drown me in love  So come on, get higher, loosen my lips  Faith and desire and the swing of your hips  Just pull me down hard  And drown me in love    I miss the sound of your voice  The loudest thing in my head  And I ache to remember  All the violent, sweet, perfect words that you said  If I could walk on water  If I could tell you what's next  I'd make you believe  I'd make you forget    So come on, get higher, loosen my lips  Faith and desire and the swing of your hips  Just pull me down hard  And drown me in love  So come on, get higher, loosen my lips  Faith and desire and the swing of your hips  Just pull me down hard  And drown me in love    I miss the pull of your heart  I taste the sparks on your tongue  I see angels and devils and God, when you come on  Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on  Singin' sha la la la  Singin' sha la la la la    So come on, get higher, loosen my lips  Faith and desire and the swing of your hips  Just pull me down hard  And drown me in love  So come on, get higher, loosen my lips  Faith and desire and the swing of your hips  Just pull me down hard  And drown me, drown me in love    So wrong, So wrong   So wrong, So right  So come on, get higher  So come on and get higher  'Cause everything works, love  Everything works in your arms|`|AA10503158	come on get higher - matt nathanson
AA12390047	I think the producers always look at the ones who didn't get chosen by the Bachelor to go on to be the next Bachlorette.  It depends if Stephanie wants to go through this again.|`|9rLi9pSRaa	I think we as women like Stephanie because she is so cool and collected and not afraid to be vulnerable.  She is sweet and never says an unkind word about anyone.  BUT guys are not that into her.  She appears uptight and too controlled for men.  She is really into her little girl and men want someone who is into them.  I would love to see her as the next Bachelorette but she is not into the kissing thing and you know how much of that goes on.  So I don't think they would pick her.  She should maybe let her eyebrows grow in a little too.  Pencil eyebrows are kind of a no no.   Maybe bangs too as her forehead is a little wide , something to soften her look.  She is gorgeous as we all know and a true ballerina looking type but she needs to soften the look.  Whatever I hope she finds happiness.  I can see her with an executive banker type of guy.|`|MTF8Nz0haa	I agree with you.  She's my favorite.  I hope they make her the next bachelorette so she can finally find someone to share her life with. Let me check the ABC site.|`|dWeHChwwaa	omg i would love you for that. i think Stephanie is the most amazing, beautiful woman i have ever seen. I kind of figured they wouldnt make a match, but i love her anyways. Shes so kind, and i just love her.   Usually right when the commercial comes on, abc has this brief commercial stating if you want to nominate the next bachelor or bacheloreette , and they put a number and website. Try abc website, Im sure you could find it there|`|Tv9uXv00aa	aaawwwww she is SO sweet and an all around fun/compassionate cool person i would love her to be the next bachelorette i would definately watch the show. plus to another girls comment.. i think tons of guys would be all over her especially nice sincere ginuwine men that are looking for exactly her to be their wife    go stephanie!!|`|EJFUwslqaa	I've thought all along that she is not right for Jason.  However, I think Stephanie is a TRUE southern Belle, she's very classy, very gracious.  I think she'd make a great next Bachelorette, and I've thought all along she would be cut and would become the next Bachelorette!  She's not drop dead gorgeous, she's a little older, and she has a child.  I think it would make for great filming!  People these days want to see real reality, not so much fake garbage!  And she's very genuine.  I'm anxious to see if we are all right about the next bachelorette!  Either way, I know she has a wonderful life ahead of her.  Her daughter will see her through it all!|`|6Nmly1wmaa	I nope that she is she is so sweet|`|gRcUK21Haa	I totally agree! Just because she is reserved does not mean she wouldn't make a good bachelorette. We need more ladies like her to be presented on TV. Too many hoochies    I also saw a comment where someone did not think she would do that because she didn't want her daughter to have the chance to google her later in life. Stephanie showed us with the bachelor that she is a lady and will always present herself in that way. I don't think she would ever do anything that|`|GLffLgFXaa	That's so funny...as she was driving away in the limo after getting cut, I was thinking she would be perfect as the next bachelorette. I think because of her story people want to see her find love.|`|086d615fc3fda7d4d556cde788fecd15aa	Oh sweet cripes.  That would absolutely be the most excruciatingly boring season ever.  The woman does not have the personality or drama to carry a season and I scream in fear every time I see her over-teased hair, age inappropriate clothes (or clothes that look like wall paper or dead fuzzy animals), slathered on make-up, botoxed out the wazoo forehead and eyes and drawn on eye-brows.  I have been a loyal viewer since season 1 and if she became the B'ette, I would become a loyal NON-viewer.|`|gfaVkY0iaa	Please share with as many people as possible. I want her to be the next Bachelorette. She would be perfect.     Call 1-866-739-3150 to sign her up.
p3rnyBoYaa	A decade of music is a lot of songs. It becomes a matter of taste for most of us. There are songs that I like from the 60's as well as the 80's.  There are also songs from those eras that I rather not hear again.  My criteria here is how many songs from both those decades would show up on my top 500 list and the count would probably tilt in favor of the 70's first, with the 80's edging the 60's out for second place.|`|FfxmE9Toaa	The 1960s kicked open the door to a variety of styles and experimentation, so the 1960s wins hands-down.     A decade that began with the death of Eddie Cochran and ended with the triumph of Woodstock with Dylan, The Beatles, The Animals and The Yardbirds. A decade that saw a new generation embracing blues music, with Jimi, Mike Bloomfield, Carlos Santana and Johnny Winter coming to the fore.    Then consider The Kinks/Troggs/Standells doing punk way before the Ramones.    The 1960s.|`|ME4XWNmRaa	The60s by far, i was already grown by the 80s and know that very few songs actually meant something or stood for somehing. The 60s had a massive amount of music like that. You had huge rock festivals, not to mention The Beatles, Rolling Stones, The Who, Cream, The Doors, The Yardbirds, The Kinks, and Jimi Hendrix just to name a few. Not one band in the 80s can measure up to any of those bands. Dont get me wrong, i really love the 80s music but it cant seriously be compared to the 60s in any conversation.|`|vI3Ihd6gaa	NEVER EVER AGAIN COMPARE THE BEATLES TO U2|`|dvUS0HHXaa	I prefer the 60s, but it really is depending on personal tastes and preferences.|`|aKb0RASbaa	Oh definitely the 80's.|`|KX8oWwDzaa	I actually prefer the 80's to the 60's, but if you were to put the 70's in there, that would be another story... the 70's were the best of both worlds I think, you get the 60's feel earlier on, and the 80's feel later on.     But I don't know about New Wave and Nirvana, not my favorite.... and the Doors rocked!|`|HgeBc8IPaa	80'S|`|jlEJn1v9aa	in all there was so much happening in the 80's that most people like it if ur into metal it was big if u liked depeshe mode it was there everything and in the 60's it was limited due to the time era but personally musically speaking the 60's is what changed the world of music as we know it today|`|ZwYt2LNuaa	The 80's of course|`|CEkxWCwXaa	80's!    I agree with you on Nirvana and New Wave.     I'm big on Metal, so of course, I'm gonna love the 80's; Guns N' Roses, Anthrax, Exodus, Kreator, Motley Crue etc!     AND DEF LEPPARD! My gawd, I love them =D    Plus the hot rockers... it's all there ^_^|`|46e2a496285e8eb37e4ada2aac6111b8aa	I was going to go for the 60's hands down when I first read this, but then I forgot about Bruce Springsteen, David Bowie, Prince... yeah. It's a toss up. In my opinion, both generations were great in their own way.|`|AA11452399	My personal favorites are the 60's & 70's, which I think were the best ever, but isn't it just about personal taste?? No one can tell you what to like, you choose. Every generation is going to find their own music as the best. I was born in 1952, and I like music from the 40's, 50's, 60's, 70's, 80's 90's. Just a few since the 90's. Not really into much of the today stuff. So if you believe the 80's were best, keep in mind thats just an opinion.|`|2c9e27b528ec302c442a3ff42014807daa	The 80's! It was a great decade for New Wave, Power Pop, Punk and Techno.  If you going to liken The Beatles to any band in the 80's it would have to be XTC.|`|fx3gIRh2aa	Nirvana was 90's...I'm aware that their first album was released in '89, but they didn't get big 'til the next decade...they're similar to Led Zeppelin in that respect, I suppose (LZ's first 2 albums released in '69 but a lot of people think of them as a 70's band, regardless).    Anway, music is always evolving...to call one decade better than another means to ignore the fact that most 1980's musicians were directly influenced by quite a few 1960's musicians.

lUe4rReZaa	What I recommend is going out and playing as many different guitars as you can find in your price range.  One will probably stand out for comfort, playability and tone.  Get that guitar.  Some good brands to look for in that price range are Ibanez, Alaverez, Epiphone, Fender,  Laguna, Wasburn and Yamaha.|`|bilBsC0Raa	If I were you I would get a Fender.

They're factory direct so you get the best deal.  I currently own an SX Spider acoustic-electric that I bought from them for a hundred dollars, and it performs just as well as some Taylors (for $1200) that I've played.  Keep in mind shipping is about $30, so you've got about $230 to work with.  That'll get you a really nice Agile or Valencia.

The pet store was selling them for five cents a piece.  I thought that  odd since they were normally a couple thousand each.  I decided not to  look a gift horse in the mouth.  I bought 200.  I like monkeys.    I took my 200 monkeys home.  I have a big car.  I let one drive.  His  name was Sigmund.  He was retarded.  In fact, none of them were really  bright.  They kept punching themselves in their genitals.  I laughed.  Then they punched my genitals.  I stopped laughing.    I herded them into my room.  They didn't adapt very well to their new  environment.  They would screech, hurl themselves off of the couch at  high speeds and slam into the wall.  Although humorous at first, the  spectacle lost its novelty halfway into its third hour.    Two hours later I found out why all the monkeys were so inexpensive:  they all died.  No apparent reason.  They all just sorta' dropped dead.  Kinda' like when you buy a goldfish and it dies five hours later.  Damn  cheap monkeys.    I didn't know what to do.  There were 200 dead monkeys lying all over my  room, on the bed, in the dresser, hanging from my bookcase. It looked  like I had 200 throw rugs.    I tried to flush one down the toilet.  It didn't work.  It got stuck.  Then I had one dead, wet monkey and 199 dead, dry monkeys.    I tried pretending that they were just stuffed animals.  That worked for  a while, that is until they began to decompose.  It started to smell real  bad.    I had to pee but there was a dead monkey in the toilet and I didn't want  to call the plumber.  I was embarrassed.    I tried to slow down the decomposition by freezing them.  Unfortunately  there was only enough room for two monkeys at a time so I had to change  them every 30 seconds.  I also had to eat all the food in the freezer so  it didn't all go bad.    I tried burning them.  Little did I know my bed was flammable.  I had to  extinguish the fire.    Then I had one dead, wet monkey in my toilet, two dead, frozen monkeys in  my freezer, and 197 dead, charred monkeys in a pile on my bed.  The odor  wasn't improving.    I became agitated at my inability to dispose of my monkeys and to use the  bathroom.  I severely beat one of my monkeys.  I felt better.    I tried throwing them way but the garbage man said that the city wasn't  allowed to dispose of charred primates.  I told him that I had a wet  one.  He couldn't take that one either.  I didn't bother asking about the  frozen ones.    I finally arrived at a solution.  I gave them out as Christmas gifts.  My  friends didn't know quite what to say.  They pretended that they like  them but I could tell they were lying.  Ingrates.  So I punched them in  the genitals.

My father was a relentlessly self-improving boulangerie owner from Belgium with low grade narcolepsy and a penchant for buggery. My mother was a fifteen year old French prostitute named Chloe with webbed feet. My father would womanize, he would drink. He would make outrageous claims like he invented the question mark. Sometimes he would accuse chestnuts of being lazy. The sort of general malaise that only the genius possess and the insane lament. My childhood was typical. Summers in Rangoon, luge lessons. In the spring we'd make meat helmets. When I was insolent I was placed in a burlap bag and beaten with reeds- pretty standard really. At the age of twelve I received my first scribe. At the age of fourteen a Zoroastrian named Vilma ritualistically shaved my testicles.

Most people will just tell you to just play or use tabs, which is fine to do too, but to really master the guitar you should learn your scales.    I would try next level guitar. They have free lessons on Youtube as well as a whole system of video lessons on their website. Their main focus is music theory to learn how to play the guitar.    If that's just too much for you a basic plan would be to learn chords at first. Just play your guitar, and learn what notes or sounds come from each fret you press. The more time you spend playing and learning by ear the better you will get at improvisation.|`|Yy5F0Py0aa	i myself play the guitar.  i self taught myself, but i do not recommend it.  i would say that you should start lessons, it makes you learn MUCH quicker.  it would definitely be the way to go.  find a local music store, they usually have guitar lessons.|`|VVbZzAVLaa	www.answer.com|`|ctE1mihuaa	You could go on www.youtube.com & learn some guitar tabs and chords.

zX8QN7rQaa	i don't really know. i am kind of sick with the whole "OH MY GOD, TWIIIILLLLLLLIIIIIIGHT IS SO GOOD"    i guess i might read the books, and watch the movie to see what the big thing is about... i don't know.|`|BQXASRHzaa	Twilight is just one of those types of entertainment made for middle school girls. The movie was so gross and stupid that you will puke if you watch it...personally...I did. I did not read the book, but I hear it was all about a girl obsessing over a vampire. If you're a female under the age of 14, you'll like it...I guarantee it.|`|Szi2k5Nwaa	I hated the book and hated the movie.  Too much hype for something so stupid.  The vamps aren't even real vamps, vamps don't glitter when they walk out into the sun. They boil from the inside out. That was just one of many, many reasons why I hate everything Twilight. The writer should of done a little research.  -- just my opinion|`|0A4JuK7Saa	I'am annoying by it too. I hate the book becuase its really dull and boring. I gaved twlight 0/10. I hope edward dies even though he is an undead creature.|`|4x2KMVbBaa	If you've never read it or seen it, then how can you have an opinion on it? That's rediculous. I loved the movie and the book because I read it and saw it. I'll never be sick of it and you might as well get used to it because a new movie will be out for the next 3 years!|`|9HWexOtEaa	The books are amazing, beautiful books. The movie is a little cheesey, but overall they did a pretty good job. But I don't like how most people don't really care, they just like the actors and watched the movie because it's popular. I'm not obsessed, I just think the books are awesome.|`|24yMSJUtaa	My cousin got me into twilight and I'm a book worm and after hearing all theraving about four books I decided to start reading them.  To tell you the truth, I've read WAY better books than Twilight. I've only read the first two, but I just got too bored with them and I saw the movie as well and thats a let down to the books.  And I cant stand all the Twilight fans getting all offended when you make fun of them! It/they are SO annoying!  Trust me, people, I've read BETTER books that THAT!  Hope my opinion helped :):):)|`|G8Owvst7aa	it's a good movie..  it is romantic..

Here's one example from the barber shop:  Barber Martin: There. You finally look like a human being again. You shouldn't wait so long between hair cuts, you cheap son of a *****.   Walt Kowalski: Yeah. I'm surprised you're still around. I was always hoping you'd die off and they got someone in here that knew what the hell they were doing. Instead, you're just hanging around like the duop dego you are.   Barber Martin: That'll be ten bucks, Walt.   Walt Kowalski: Ten bucks? Jesus Christ, Marty. What are you, half Jew or somethin'? You keep raising the damn prices all the time.   Barber Martin: It's been ten bucks for the last five years, you hard-nosed pollock son of a *****.   Walt Kowalski: Yeah, well keep the change.   Barber Martin: See you in three weeks, prick.   Walt Kowalski: Not if I see you first, dipshit.|`|Aw26KuJcaa	that was an awesome movie, watch movie again

dvUS0HHXaa	Awesome avatar (Deluxe Telecaster?) and very good question :)    I find it kind of difficult when writing instrumental pieces, but it really depends. In one sense you don't have the lyrical aspect to focus on, but on the other hand I feel that I have to make up for the lack of lyrics with more interesting and complex musicianship, which can be hard to do. Emotions also seem to be put on the backburner for a lot of instrumentals, as the artist relies on flashy playing more than any meaning and feeling. In that sense it is harder to write a good quality instrumental.     In many ways songs with lyrics can be easier as you can decide on the feel of the song based on the lyrics, instead of having to create the mood with the instruments alone. Lyrics can be very hard to write, though. Sometimes they are very hard to get out and are sometimes very easy and flowing.    So, in summary, it really depends for me. Sometimes I just get stacks of ideas for songs which makes it really easy and other times I really struggle to write anything of substance and quality.|`|CEkxWCwXaa	That's a very debatable question, you're going to get different answers from different people.    I'd say that instrumentals are harder; it's a lot more difficult to get a message across, and all in all it's harder to write, because you have to make the guitar riffs/bass line/drum beat more complicated and dyamic to keep the listener interested, and to show emotion, as opposed to a song with lyrics, where you can just have basic guitar chords behind the lyrics, and still be able to get the same message across.    But I personally think instrumentals are more effective. Look at the works of Buckethead, and especially Michael Angelo Batio. He's done covers of songs such as All Along the Watchtower and Dream On, and I personally think they convey emotion better than the original versions.|`|xBiLoU8Laa	A song has 2 parts music and lyrics when you get rid of one you must solely concentrate on the one thing in this case instrumental music. On one point its easier because its having your workload (no lyrics) but secondly its harder because if it has no lyrics you have to make the song interesting solely interesting and listenable without words. Its a bit of an oxymoron (contradiction) really its easier yet its harder at the same time.     I would like to second your killer avatar.|`|0ZxYrtv0aa	It depends. People who are good at writing stories and poems would probably be awesome at writing lyrics. But people like me, who have hardly any imagination, find it very difficult to come up with lyrics and easier just to write an instrumental.|`|PpI1ggWGaa	An instrumental will free you up as there is not the restriction of vocal range. Personally - writing instrumentals is easier.|`|JGXQcNsKaa	Instrumentals are much harder because when there are lyrics, the song con be a bit more repetitive. I don't mean that songs with lyrics have simple, redundant lines, I'm just saying that they actually need a bit of repetitiveness for the lyrics. However, when there aren't any lyrics, you have to make a constantly changing song that will keep people interested without any vocals.|`|SmtoSb02aa	Depends who you are and what you play. Some days instrumental is what you want, it can just be difficult expressing your feelings through sound, sometimes not so much.   Writing is just as hard because it's almost as though there's a certain 'magic' there that ties the words and music together. Sometimes it's just not working.  Honestly, I think they're both pretty much equal. It depends on the person, how you're feeling and all that junk. Of course, perfectionism plays a role. =||`|tVkRmb3Paa	i think a song with lyrics is easier but instrumentally wise all you have to do is put down a couple of nice chord progressions together but instrumental wise you have to sing through your instrument which i find more challenging than witting lyrics. Im wrong in some cases like some songs have great lyrics and instruments but most oftenly these days the songs are really cheesy easy to think of lyrics.|`|7fe2e12eefd613a85a2294cb674aea83aa	It all has to do with the themes you are working with. If it is an instrumental then the musical themes have to be a lot stronger and complex. It is also much better for the rhythm section to play instrumental tracks.    Songs with lyrics depend less on musical virtuosity and more on the emotional range and breadth of the vocals and what the singer is trying to say through the lyrics.    I enjoy writing both as they give me an opportunity to express myself in different avenues of the same medium. I prefer listening to instrumentals as the human voice is always open to interpretation and not one person will feel the same way about a song. Instrumentals are much more open ended in terms of direction and purpose. There is a lot more room for personal projection.|`|sz1YqwUEaa	Instrumental. Mostly Because lyrics help me get idea on what to play.|`|wPV0Nz3Haa	Instrumental........ Never satisfied..... hard to settle for less....... Personally...... WAY...... more time consuming.

Acq3JBiHaa	You can't always pay attention to what other people say about you.  Start slow by just saying hi, and take it from there.  Don't try to do everything at once.  You also don't have to let a guy know how much you like them.  Form a friendship and see where it goes.  Hope this helps.|`|fdP9UJOsaa	Since its almost valentines day, try talking to your crush. You don't have to bust a move on him or anything... just start a small hi & bye conversation with him each time you two meet. Continue this everyday and he might surprise you on valentines day, who knows!|`|AA10412319	hey you are 16. you have plenty of time. seriously you are still in school, finish up high school, yes you might get a bf but just remember he might not be your husband but you never know. once in college, you will meet people there and maybe then you will get a guy there too. dont rush things. i see you wrote that you arent attractive. dont be so negative. if you put on some lip gloss, dress nicely and a guy will approach. plus a boy will love for you are and not what you look like. maybe even get a nice haircut. just think happy thoughs. good luck with your crush!!! :) im 23 and i just got dumped by my  1st bf. hes only 19 and he never had a gf, so dont worry, you will be fine.|`|dlqa6yFkaa	Well, it's up to you really. If your happy to just go on as you are than do nothing but if you think you would be happier with a boyfriend than try to get one. I really think you could just try talking to the guy first and maybe see how that goes, you don't have to jump right in and have him as a boyfriend, just have a chat each day and see what happens. If you get a good feeling and he seems to like you, take it to the next level.|`|aqsUNGfEaa	Start off talking to a guy in a more private place and keep working your way up to more and more of a social setting. Basically though, you just have to take the first step and push yourself beyond your comfort zone. Sucks but it's true.

Everybody has thier strengths & weaknesses.|`|re06t6zvaa	i would say risk it. we only live life once, and you shouldn't live in fear of being rejected. & even if you do, just hold your head up high and keep trying. & there is no such thing as "not attractive". everyone is pretty in their own way. you will get a boyfriend eventually, just don't give up.|`|PP0hNckuaa	you dont need to be flirty to get a guy, theres so many fish in the ocean, eventually they will come to you.     http://clickako.blogspot.com/  http://doubleu3x.blogspot.com/|`|2u3ze0Asaa	using my own words and all.  You should wait for a guy to come to me one day. :)  If you want to be more confident.  You should always think about positive thoughts, thinking of negative makes you down and shy more.

Yes, it was easy, because I was so happy, and so enthusiastic about it!! :)|`|EzrdyxAiaa	super hard and what i know you can cover in a one page paper!!!|`|3j7WE8jGaa	I think I found it quite easy for the most part....but I started when I was quite young....I think I was using computers (for word processing) regularly from the age of around 11 at school (this would have been around 20 years ago)....and I had used computers occasionally before that...although mainly for games. We must have bought our first computer at home when I was around 11 or 12, too.    I only really started using the internet and e-mail regularly after I went to college at the age of 20....in late 1997. I do remember thinking how exciting it seemed in those days. Again, I think I caught on quite quickly....at least when it came to the things I really had an interest in and wanted to do on the computer.|`|JhvqUvlsaa	I was really young when I started using those computers that were the size of a small car lol.    And when I started using modern-day computers, I was prolly in my mid-to-late twenties.    When we bought our first laptop, I figured out a lot of stuff on my own, and had help with the other things I didn't know|`|nkmwGAKjaa	I was in my mid-fifties before I really started using the computer.  I am still not very computer savvy. ;-(|`|a4LWildhaa	I was about 55. The stuff you list I figured out, been doing it ten years now. BUT-the facebook and myspace sites are both difficult to use. I had one of my sons re-do my myspace page-couldn't figure it out.|`|AA12187799	odd,thought all you had to do was type in a question,and it`d answer you|`|XAioHGKbaa	Easy, have had computers since 1982|`|d09ca82ef4d1521ac23c334df2e8eedeaa	I found it very difficult. I had no idea how to type and found the whole process of using a computer clumsy and awkward. I started learning at the age of 40 and can only say it's lucky for me we have a teenager in the house. When I grab my hammer to fix the computer he steps in and saves the day :).|`|HDqOXDFIaa	We've only had ours for about 2 years now & I'm still getting used to it!|`|444cc0a50021891de69824c19550f54daa	I'm one of the generation that grew up with a pc  My brother bought his first PC when I was about 8 some 20 years ago and that thing didn't even have a hard disk.  we had to manually start the thing with a dos floppy before it would work.  and after a few dozen commands we could play Pacman or digger.  great memories.  but lets just say that it has only gotten easier for me from there on.|`|c6ff08c632b9e5165a8a3d098d3a1710aa	I will be 46 in March and I believe it was about 10 years now since I have had a computer and internet.    They make them user-friendly and for the most part I shove along OK-Once I go beyond unto the depths past the things you mentioned ITS a whole new unexplored world!! lo    You do fine Dizz :-) You are a warm person for all us to have as a freind to spend this time with :-)|`|GeyFdO5jaa	It  was difficult at first  but  i taught myself all i know   how old was i ,,  44  and still using it|`|bcf393e4db41afbc89350db8fced8a1aaa	dizz, no it wasn't cuz I learned it my sophomore year in high school when I still had a lot of brain cells to store the information I was being fed.|`|92d57b37b7c75c656647e34f55fa3e0caa	i cant really remmember   i was so young when i were first introduced to technology

cxNLOPHNaa	Yes. Back in the late 80's. I FINALLY had enough miles saved up to get a flight on that plane.    It was more than worth it. A few things that I remember-    1- The cabin was very small, all one class, seat configuration was 2seats/aisle/2seats. The seats were narrow and the pitch was a little cramped even for me (I'm only 5 ft). I also recall, that a few men actually scraped their heads on the very low ceiling.    2- The windows got HOT and at one point, when you looked out of the window, you could see the curvature of the earth. Also, there was a thin blue layer over the curve, which is our atmosphere.    3- Unlike conventional jets, that ascend at a steep angle, Concorde went straight up.|`|NKuQh4sSaa	No I never did . It was one of my dreams when I was a kid . It seems sad now seeing it on display at Manchester Airport .|`|3FKMMoXkaa	Nopeee|`|dhnR4bixaa	nopee.    but i wish i did.    :(|`|zahy4Brqaa	No. But I was at Heathrow at the time of the Paris crash.

But I do remember the tragic day of the crash...|`|yBWFn0JYaa	no, but that would have been very cool!|`|70kJJJ7uaa	No.. Did you ever blow a fart and think it wasn't there?|`|s3FUR37xaa	Nah!|`|yvoGbxshaa	I was going too it's very expensive in the thousands of dollars|`|G6t2O9Kmaa	No.|`|0JnSRrR6aa	nope would have been cool though|`|0b749584c35f2d85b042fb4c77b72f79aa	no,i haven't....|`|eTTkAv9Yaa	Unfortunately, no.    The nearest I got was buying a car from a field on the flight path, we were stood next to each other but couldn't hear ourselves shout as it went overhead! Awesome experience, not so sure I'd be so happy if I lived under said flight path though.    Richard Branson offered to buy them and make them flight-worthy again, but just like the lottery (even though he was going to make it non-profit making) he was refused.    I deeply regret never experiencing this, it's crazy that the most advanced flight technology is now obsolete but not superseded!|`|qL02xpzEaa	no but i saw it take off the last time it did|`|wmBK9uASaa	No I never did...|`|B1GjfOUdaa	No but it would  have been something to talk about now.|`|hwQoOSfRaa	Nope, but my father in law piloted one of them    xxx

EkbhMLonaa	Stop this rumor mongering... Bobby actually came along the side of Miley as she lay in a drunkin' mess outside a popular night club.  Bobby convinced Miley to seek some R&R and get some counseling.  I don't think he made love to her but instead tried to give her some professional advice and not turn out like Lynsey or Britney.  We will see if it sticks.  Let's not accuse Miley of giving up anything at this point... Although she is getting more wreckless.|`|rL0k9trPaa	Aw :\ the media  just uses people throws them out and looks for the new toy they can talk about and dress up.

WHY do you care?  they are only celebrities
ONWCXzUMaa	I love dylan no matter what he plays, but I do love his acoustic better  take care  dave|`|bO9p8Kxdaa	Acoustic|`|qh9Pa1tVaa	Acoustic|`|geq6iU0Oaa	all of the above!|`|DnWsMhwLaa	electric.... sort of anyway...my absolute favorites are blonde on blonde, highway 61... but third is the half and half bringin it all back home. and freewheelin and another side i still rank over most of his albums.    In short, my favorites are electric, but i recognize that he made a lot of crappy electric albums too, whereas all of his acoustic albums (except maybe MTV unplugged) are exceptional.|`|71SjVwWNaa	both are great i like his acoustic days better...i'm more of an acoustic guitar kind of guy anyways so i'm kinda biased...and i love his bootleg series the tell tale signs|`|a79b8a93426576f5d2c9cb6a23ba338faa	I like both.  I listen to his electric stuff more.  I have to be in the mood to listen to his acoustic stuff.  His acoustic music is amazing though.|`|dvUS0HHXaa	Personally I like acoustic but I think he was good with his electric era, even if the songwriting did sort of suffer in a way compared to his acoustic pieces.|`|3JRUgVhraa	I think they were both brilliant in their own ways. With the electric stuff he produced a run of 3, in my opinion, flawless albums with Bringing it All Back Home, Highway 61 Revisited and Blonde on Blonde and apart from that has produced many more great albums.     His acoustic stuff was more politically minded but had the effect of you taking notice and wanting to listen to what he was saying.    I think both period's of his career have been fantastic.

1DT7OUuHaa	I agree TOTALLY with your two answers.  "Tool Academy" is right up there too.  It's so fake and stupid.  These guys are totally acting like jerks and then acting like they sincerly want to change ONLY because there is a lot of money at stake (like a lot of these shows).  The Ikki twins are gross!  If they fall in love with the same person, they can share, it's not like that's why they haven't been doing all along.  OMG, that one show with the Italian guy that was on Tila Tequila's show was AWFUL too, remember that show?  I'm glad we agree!|`|sVdQSMvJaa	Any reality show on MTV of VH1 is now and will forever be TOTAL CRAP!!    Also Who Wants to Marry a Millionaire was a terrible one.|`|kLPaq30Eaa	Yeahhh, I agree with you! Bromance doesn't really bother me at all. (By the way, Brody Jenner was on Laguna Beach and his dad was an Olympic gold medalist who is now married to Kim Kardashian's mom.) ANYWAY, the Double Shot of Love show completely disgusts me. I have a twin sister and I could never IMAGINE doing that kind of thing. It's nauseating. I hated The Real Chance of Love (it's disgusting) and The Rock of Love Bus show because honestly, it's all about who will have sex with the celebrity. It's gross.|`|v0Sn3V9Qaa	Anything on MTV, it's so obviously fake, which makes wonder what kind of sick minded people work for MTV..|`|YzhYFu0eaa	Chains of Love and Bad Girls Club|`|ltSQ8SoXaa	Friends, Everyone loves Raymond|`|3shqoZ5Oaa	brody jenner is from the hills i believe. hes hot. but i also agree he may be gay.     a double shot at love is horrible  and so is the amazing race.|`|FbZcM1nlaa	Parental control and that date my mom show. The concepts are really stupid, and they're so fake and rehearsed. All MTV shows are badly edited, but come on. If you're gonna lie and use actors, get good ones.|`|l2A2kCIPaa	1. shot at love and double shot at love  2. real chance at love|`|65009ccaf72ccd7729436ef7347a8b0daa	temptation island, mtv realities|`|0ZxYrtv0aa	Ladette to Lady is disgusting and pathetic. And I'm not too fond of The Biggest Loser. But Big Brother is right at the top of the list too. As is The Amazing Race.    Sorry, That's four, i know. :)|`|zo1lvjLlaa	mine would be   a double shot at love with the ikki twins; because like you i totally agree, why would anyone who was really interested in finding love want to watch the person they are "falling" for make out and be all over your twin?! personally, i wouldn't never be able to trust them around my sister again, so there goes a future relationship. i mean the twins are really pretty and all, but the show is really disgusting.     and  rock at love bus; mainly because most of the girls on there act so trashy.
AA10409668	I really hate American Idol.  ----------------|`|AA11178767	Simon, he doesn't lie to them!|`|mjlhZAVxaa	I like Simon.  Seriously, they are trying to act like that new chick is a household name, me, nor any of my friends have ever heard of her.  I think only one of her songs has been famously sang by someone, and it was in the 80's and it obviously wasn't that popular b/c I can't even remember what it is called now ;)  I am not even sure why they have her there.  She really is not even necessary!|`|fdP9UJOsaa	I like Simon, he tells it like it is   ... and no i don't like the new judge Kara, she acts as if she's been judging on idol since season 1|`|WodlreGLaa	Simon, he always makes it funny.    I think she is ok.|`|7swefA6Paa	yeah she not cool enough to be a judge on such a hit show. whatev. i like paula the most. not because shes the nicest but because she is so obviously on some kind of drug most of the time lol|`|AA10142515	My favourite is Simon. He may be rude and at times brutal, but he is honest. Kara is OK but she seems to be trying to take over the show. I am not to wild about her.|`|oWLO6SiKaa	Simon, he's funny.|`|MHQnGxpDaa	I'm Australian, I hate our Idol after a while.|`|2624d3bf8e4e63e26e8d8d37caca1505aa	Simon he makes the show.|`|LxfjzzM2aa	my favorite is Paula.    and Kara....eh...i dont really like her. She is very cocky and shes new on the show, so she cant come in on her first season acting like she is the best. ya know? she hasnt earned that respect.....!|`|bTLwhwR3aa	I like Simon!!! he is funny with the truth LOL    yea Kara was just..Eh..Ok to me at first  but now i like her, a bit.    :)  its funny how randy hides behind his paper to laugh, lol it makes ME laugh hahaa.|`|h7F4wA7eaa	Simon is my favorite!|`|kbxq8o9saa	PAULA!  ;]      but i like them all!     Simon, is soo honest!  lolz! eventhough sometimes looks mean!  hehe!     Randy is keeping it real!     Kara, is okay, at first she's like so mean but now, she's getting better and i kinda like her!     Well, Paula is soo kind!  lolz!         ;D|`|Acq3JBiHaa	I hate American Idol|`|HELfs3uhaa	I'd have to drink a gallon of wine before I could even make up my mind.|`|rn5xImvTaa	They all suck and so does American Idol.  WTF has happened to the American culture that we have sunk to reality tv?|`|ZXjDXxKeaa	I like Carla better...  ...  ...    ...|`|lBrCM0TWaa	simon.  i hate all the contestants too.|`|9pmpr0Eyaa	no i hate that *****........ I LOVE SIMON!!|`|Xxn7DssEaa	i think she cool but i like simon  cuz he dramatic and isn't boring|`|re06t6zvaa	randy.|`|7aisLVeiaa	Simon. Instead of sugarcoating and lying to the people who can't sing, he tells it like it is. That's what I like about him.|`|2k8TEiRtaa	Simon Cowell, he says it like it is. he can be an a$$hole sometimes though. i have not seen it this year yet.maybe I'll watch it tomorrow.|`|nVQtiU5baa	PAULA ABDUL       she is my choice coz she is wity and smart @22ed|`|nlb8jehBaa	My favourite Paula. As for kara, she is nice too|`|ZRbc4gPZaa	.|`|nsVbWXKraa	SIMON!!!! He tells it how it is!!!! No sympathy or beating around the bush, he is blunt and too the point!!!! GO SIMON!!!|`|HI5aBVYgaa	simon|`|qE8olVtaaa	Simon is the best, he tells it like it is & is still funny as hell!|`|upTcPaAyaa	I like Simon best, he's very mean yet sarcastic.     I like Kara also, she's a good addition for the show  cos Randy and Paula sometimes don't even know what they're talking about.    and can I say she's hot?      Edit : Kara is known as song-writers for a lot of popular singer such as Celine Dion, Christina Aguilera, Hilary Duff, Britney Spears, etc. So she obviously doesn't come out of nowhere.|`|ZNh9Rr8faa	I only like Simon, the rest are just there.|`|Oeih95lbaa	OH MY FRIEND , YOU ARE VERY BEAUTIFUL GIRL  I LIKE PAULA ABDUL BECAUSE SHE IS VERY SMART|`|AkuUGjoHaa	I watch it on itv2 (british channel) about 2 months after all you lot have seen it so I don't know who Kara is, but I can't wait to find out! Simon is my fave though because he is English and he created the whole thing and for once it wasn't an american that did it!|`|AA11586439	simon|`|JdTR47rhaa	Simon............... nehehehehehehehehehehehe.... *evil smile*|`|bsJVyFtEaa	i like simon, because he always judge people and talking so mean, and that make me laugh|`|GkE1J8kGaa	Simon because he tells it like it is|`|PP0hNckuaa	ryan seacreast, he was once one..just once  and yah, kara talks too much  yours truly  tobolita  http://clickako.blogspot.com/  http://doubleu3x.blogspot.com/|`|c1XvN0BVaa	Simon.|`|14b43c5bae3d09bf80336812c8aece34aa	Simon is the most honest of all of them.|`|ccccf2dbeb590052b4953d1fbdf1eb20aa	simon, hes mean but hes funny at times|`|diGsA3isaa	i like the judge kara kinda, but my favorite is simon|`|e22d86889cb88baa6ecf401b1f6a584caa	I haven't really watched it since Fantasia won, but I like Simon. He is funny!

a2b8641f3900ff3887ba8bb3aa67fb65aa	*Sometimes the 'wrapper'' is more interesting than the gift itself !!~  Or ..... the cover might be more attractive than the book itself !~  So let's wait & watch !!~?|`|wz8gx3gaaa	Billu Barber is nowhere near Delhi-6 which is another average movie of SRK.|`|cdfab17577ad8962b270c540b0b46e98aa	I agree with you.Lately SRK films are becoming very repetitive and I think so this would also be having something similar in it.As far as Delhi 6 is concerned it looks like a movie which has something new in it.Therefore I would see Delhi 6 first and then Billu Barber.|`|3XSQAekKaa	Yeah ofcours s trailerz of Delhi 6 rocks......... bt i hav a feelin dat its gonna bomb at d box office...... though d trailerz of Billu Barber is nt dat gud its gonna b a hit coz its SRK's movie|`|9GvaJ8wGaa	both are unique in their own way!|`|m4AzBVAbaa	Billu Barber all the way!!!!!!   SRK is awesome!!! i know it's not REALLY his movie, but he's in it  and the songs AREEE awesome especially love mera hit hit and marjaani  don't insult pritam!!!  i also hate delhi 6's songs. they suck!!!  billu barber is WAYYY better!!!|`|6tMDTKCwaa	You are absolutely right.....they need to get a life.|`|2734495ebe0db7825a50002a0b17e3edaa	Duuuuuuude!  Don't go to Billy the Barber!  Let your hair grow long!  Duuuuuuude!|`|AA11675707	I supportm Sharuks billu barbr|`|2mFfhIxOaa	I think it'll be BILLU BARBER.|`|3iS6dSDAaa	http://yummycelebrities.blogspot.com/200...|`|R9nfrBGPaa	i agree the songs of delhi6 are better, billu barbar looks like a typical masala bollywood movie and pure entertainment that needs no brain to get the story! delhi 6 looks more meaningfull.|`|xBOQMqU0aa	Delhi 6|`|ZWiv2N2Xaa	Delhi 6 appears to be a better film bt jus on da basis of songs a movie cant be declared a hit. It shud have sum substance in it too  Moreover Sonam Kapoor is new in da industry and hasnt had a strong impact.....as for abhishek ...HEhe  Billu Barber has SRK so definitely it wudnt go unnoticed.....it has a of star power...Priyanka,kareena and deepika 's power packed performances  lets wait and watch which one does better|`|jfPS59fiaa	yes, i agree...    delhi 6...rockkkssss, i think delhi 6 will be super hit....|`|ZZFqpeGxaa	ya..............|`|zXhB0r66aa	I think delhi 6 will be a blockbuster!  5 songs are superb! trailer is rocking!  No much hope on billu barber. Tamil version bombed big time. Let us see if Priyadarshan can direct it well. And Shah Rukh is not the main hero; he just does a cameo.Songs are also not so good. Just ordinary songs. Trailer is good but delhi 6 trailer is better than billu barber trailer!    In my opinion, delhi 6 will be a bigger hit.|`|9h29IH22aa	Oh delhi-6 anyway|`|789f0e99bb46044f524b897189da9892aa	DELHI 6|`|fa78206ad92e8a3704fb4dec6ea7a230aa	'DELHI 6'|`|OOyVDDDXaa	billu barber
a2b8641f3900ff3887ba8bb3aa67fb65aa	*Let's wait & watch !!  I liked him only in guru !!~?|`|wz8gx3gaaa	Abhishek is most under-rated actor and star.  No matter who good is his acting or hit his movie, media slammed him and report negatively about him.  But it does not matter, because Abhishek has a huge fan following and his fans are waiting for Delhi-6.  I personally not only waiting for Delhi-6 but Raavan also.|`|jfPS59fiaa	yes............ abhi rockkkssssss|`|tMTDYhjWaa	u really think that???Jr.AB can act???????? c'mon movie will do well coz of rakyesh mehra...|`|8fIon6DAaa	I dont think so... it may bring surprise package to beautiful sonam. And i dont think any of above film worked b'coz of Abhishek B|`|FIVcaNjYaa	Do you really think any of the movies above worked because of Abhishek? I will say that Guru worked beause of him. He was supporting  hero in Dhoom 2.|`|grtFahV5aa	FLOP|`|NZrjvKWjaa	Wait and watch    May be
Wa2fpDLFaa	Steve Carell, because he's Awesome. Have you ever seen a movie that he sucked in?|`|NqcnAnC1aa	Steve Carrell is awesome!|`|onkUcy19aa	It's David Duchovny by a mile. I like a guy who tells the whole world that he is a sex addict and wants to be cured of his addiction. Now, I call that honesty and courage beyond the call of duty.|`|6zXpA0PNaa	Steve Carell...he may be the 40 year old virgin, but at least he's not a paranormal investigator/tranny with a sex addiction...*cringes*    EDIT: I agree with the guy below me (LOL). He may have came out to the world about it...but does the whole world have to know??? C'mon, he's Moulder!|`|1ykzSRtKaa	Steve. His hilarious.|`|vMiX1lL7aa	David Duchovny cos he was able to find help when he knew he had a problem.|`|cE8SQUEbaa	Steve Carell. Because he's funny...

They both do different things so it's hard to compare one another.  But Jessica's prettier.|`|NqcnAnC1aa	Jessica Alba is prettier, but I love Taylor's music.|`|bTLwhwR3aa	Taylor  She sings   she is prettier  she is better!|`|rj5KWEtcaa	jessica alba for sure|`|PlVh12fpaa	taylor swift is so much prettier then jessica!|`|Ibj8FjfRaa	Taylor Swift because she's a better singer.|`|h6STVsR1aa	Jess dunno why|`|uReFjOONaa	.|`|onkUcy19aa	Jessica Alba because she is so sexy and wholesome, and I really like her smile. Sorry, Taylor but I don't like your smile.|`|6MOn3H8Yaa	I like both. But Jessica Alba is just more mature and very likeable.|`|vMiX1lL7aa	Jessica Alba,, taylor swift kinda looks like a mouse to me|`|cE8SQUEbaa	jessica alba...don't know why...|`|wybNxsu1aa	Taylor Swift. Jessica Alba is an IDIOT. Did you hear her comment about Sweden?
Leda2ha0aa	I don't really think they would be able to have a second season unless they found "beautiful" people living under rocks or in caves.  I don't think the ratings are that great for the show since the first week, so I would not expect a second season to occur.|`|dQxI8FlSaa	definitely think this is an interesting show. Poor C.J. He got it but just didn't get it. Maybe for a  season 2 they will have them knowing choose between 2 tough right & wrong scenarios. i dont know, it is hard. will be interesting|`|c7c2edd21d0b5950dd5e9dca0e02c090aa	I think it will be similar to the shows "Average Joe" or "For Love or Money", wherein either they got several seasons in the can already before going to screen with this first one, or they will change the name of the show or the premise when casting for future seasons.|`|dUwbDQBDaa	I don't really expect a second season but we'll never know, most of these reality shows are sort of rigged. That's why people get confused on how they get people to join shows with "secrets". plus they judge horribly. CJ was one with the real inner beauty and they eliminated him? Chelsea has a heart too but they let her out, so the one you'll be seeing in People magazine is horrible.
tSqeN28Baa	I like the grey and black one :D, its really nice :D|`|zLGOQQs5aa	gray and black!  i have a shirt that says 'drop beats not bombs' and it has a bunch of music notes around it. its so cute!|`|rTLp1ZGQaa	Both are nice.

Maybe throw up a lot too. Then try to enjoy the rest of the day at the amusement park!|`|AA10950898	I would be disgusted and vomiting by then. What a terrible thought.|`|aqsUNGfEaa	It's funny that you had to change the word VOMIT. I'd be pissed, but I guess I just find a water ride asap.|`|AA11354548	theres no after,  i'd be like peace mofo.  hahahah :D|`|zxSDu1Dbaa	rinse my hair and clean my clothes... when I get home I would probably throw those clothes away... i don't know what you ate before the ride.|`|0Dq30l5Saa	Probably cry like a little baby.|`|glI1vtsqaa	SCREAM.. and then get over it. No use in getting worked up over something the other person couldn't help  :( .... lmao I'd probably do just the opposite but the first thing sounded good right? lol|`|e22d86889cb88baa6ecf401b1f6a584caa	Throw up myself probably. In the middle of the ride, then everyone else would throw up.

Only it was her vomit that landed on her head.  It was one of those rides where you spin around so you're upside down. And she threw up when she was upside down and then it landed on her.    It was fairly disgusting.|`|oooxgH7Maa	you B****! how dare you! urgh!!!!! (full on B*^$ fight)|`|hKiSCL4Iaa	I'd punch you for not knowing your limits.|`|P1gryElRaa	Most likely throw up on you.   Then my question to you is what would you do if you vomited on me and then I vomited on you???  Keep in mind your all out of vomit now, so what do you do???|`|r8LJEJwbaa	Probably hurt you. :/|`|jRNexOtWaa	i would make sure ur okay. then go and clean up after.     but still ewwww!lol|`|AA11575933	honestly i woud probly be screaming or crying, then i woud throw up. and then i woud find u and slap u and make u pay for everything i was wearing and then i woud probly swear at u a lot and then i woud tell u to never go on a roller coaster again. then i woud most likely go home and clean up after i gave u a lecture about how u ruined my day and the ppl i was with|`|WlHB84lOaa	uh, return the favor?|`|q5TgBFdtaa	I would probably scream and be a little pissed. Then I would go to the bathroom and try to get as much off as possible, clean myself. If i'm in like six flags or disney world of some sort, I would go to the store and buy some clothes and wear those.|`|pszeAtFkaa	Make sure you were ok...then, go get my hand stamped & go home and take a shower.|`|thTV5Qi2aa	I'll take stinky revenge! i'll puke back on u...|`|iEorrKYBaa	I will wash my hair and just try to continue having fun. Of course you wont be there because I threw you off the ride :-]|`|hRRsnfglaa	BE SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO MAD|`|1IIY1Ds6aa	shower??|`|0jDuZRGfaa	Eat the vomit ( Jk)|`|23033d499769542e5e7910234a60e4f7aa	Wash it off and get on with my day...    I have 3 kids you wouldn't be the first to vomit on me and probably won't be the last....|`|Bru5jJZraa	Be grossed out but I wouldn't show it too much I don't want to embarress you :]|`|PlVh12fpaa	OMG!!! I WOULD FREAK OUT!!!|`|sVrkjixAaa	Grab you by the throat until you gave me enough money not to care about the vomit anymore.|`|6MOn3H8Yaa	take you down. Naw.I would get clean up and watch out for potential people who will vomit over my head.|`|DcUoZntOaa	send you on another ride and run like hell..  j/k  peace!|`|kNAcutL0aa	i will slap your face again and again|`|vXOreO4Uaa	I will be like mothafu*ker lol..jk    I wouldn't say anything i'll throw up on your shirt..lol|`|174hHTXDaa	Ewww...

I wouldn't have the stomach to ride any more rides.|`|ij9N9r5waa	Start a vomit-a-thon. cus I smell it I'm gonna do it.
Xxn7DssEaa	haha  your trusty truck??  ha ha ha you're so cute     i'll prolly lose my mind and outwit the son of abull    ha idk i should really think this through if i don't wanna go to prison|`|r9p8WRXTaa	erm if i.m in the car n i died i will hunt him if i survive i will tell him to the police and demand him to pay|`|AA11536708	I would have them arrested then put in the prison where my brother is the warden, then make sure that my brother made their stay as..uhm...uncomfortable as possible.|`|uIIvMi68aa	id get in another car and drag their face sin city style[marv]|`|QAxQM18taa	I will call the police, sue him, and demand him to pay back the damage he has cost!

jFHZo7pGaa	OMG YES!! I I can't go on the big roller coasters!! They freak me out! I love watching people on them though! I also can't understand how people can go on those crazy scary ones! Ah! :) I'm always so scared I'll fall out! One time, when I was little, I was on one of those log rides and when my ride hit the water I fell underneath the safety bar into the foot rest! I fit all the requirements to ride the ride too! Ever since then I've been slightly freaked about rollercoasters!|`|BoHH9EwRaa	Hellz ya  but when i was little me mum yelled at me and said if you never tried anything then you will never know if you like it|`|MnIxiSw5aa	No, I love them!!:)|`|qxHwSQTHaa	Not anymore.

I work(ed) at Shasta Caverns as a Tour Guide/Bus Driver. A lot of the other guides swore up and down that the place was haunted. Different tourists periodically would freak out. People would swear they saw ghosts, shadows, things that weren't there. All it was, was the darkness playing tricks on the mind. I used to shut off all the lights and walk into the caves in perfect darkness. That would freak out alot of people. Out of about 20 employee's there was only one other guy that was afraid of the dark and was willing to walk through the entire cave tour without any lights on or flash lights.|`|CZ3gQoIZaa	Yes, in the matter of fact, I do.  Wait...does a school count as a Dark, Scary Place?|`|clqgFUFFaa	I work in a chineese restaurant so yes|`|23033d499769542e5e7910234a60e4f7aa	Nope...

Its sometimes amazing where fire extinguishers need to be installed.  The scariest place was in a room, no light,with a very noisy motor, on the roof of a tall building. Not too scary right?  It is if the wind blows the door shut and it can only be open from the outside and everyone you phone cant hear a word you're saying over the noise and no one actually knows you're up there.|`|lU12YtI2aa	Dark no....but trust me....being a substitute teacher is downright SCARY!

60c7b85533ff654ef788c2cbd51c8788aa	Good question but, before I answer, I need to know...  "Did She Mention My Name"?    you see, it was just past "Sundown" you might recall "On this Winter's Night with You" asking that very question, I whispered to her "Softly", "Rosanna" darling... "If you Could Read My Mind" you'd know "The Way I Feel" and that I wanted to take a trip with her down that "Carefree Highway" just before those dark clouds turned us into "Rainy Day People", far below the "Mountains and Maryann" where I said that I thought she was "Beautiful" "For Lovin' Me" and yes, I know "I'm Not Supposed to Care" but you know, "I'd Do It Again" because my love for her was strong enough to even prevent "The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald" in that "Early Morning Rain" that felt so "Cold On The Shoulder" just before it became spring and we were about to enjoy "The Summer Side of Life".    but alas, that was "The Last Time I Saw Her" and unfortunately for me, I never did learn "The Wherefor and Why".    My answer to your question?   I think you've already figured it out because...well...  there's just "Too Many Clues in This Room".|`|pNUtnoC8aa	Gordon Lightfoot.|`|2bVxBCgzaa	Gord is an amazing talent.

qNGvhvmXaa	Easy...the house gets messy, the husband may have to fend for himself a night or two (for food I mean).  As long as your baby is fed, played with, well cared for...then everything will be alright in the world.    Make sure your hubby helps out around the house though.  I found this is what is the most helpful.  My husband pitches in and helps with housework, giving the baby his bath, feeding, etc.  So far, the only tasks he doesn't do is cleaning the bathroom and changing the litter box.  I take care of these on the weekends.    Also, try to get as many errands as you can done during your lunch hour.  When you don't have any errands to do, sit in a park and read a book during your lunch.    Don't worry.  You will get a system worked out that is good for you.|`|a069e9067627f183dfb36a948494aea1aa	Not a wife, but.....    When we had our daughter, I told my wife that it was a serious commitment. We would be putting our own lives in hold for 18 years.  We did, for 18 years we pretty much lived around the daughter's schedule. (It was that for both of us, btw.)  We both worked full-time and took our daughter to every little thing that went on at school and the band practice and such.    But here we are, 19 years later, the daughter is married and living in a dorm an hour and a half away.    It wasn't always easy, but looking at it from this end, it was definitely worth every sacrifice.     That isn't what you expected, but your 2-year-old will be gone far too soon.

Now i see people differently.I see them not only physically but also what lies deep in their heart.That a person is capable  not only of being good but of being great.|`|067cfce359fe4a887b29915d9ffcd12faa	Yes,   I was driving home in  a snow storm by myself from TN to IL and I was 7 months pregnant.     Pure ice, lots of cars and trucks in ditches and despite going 15 miles an hour I ended up on slick snow that was someone else's path that of course slid right into the ditch, there wasn't a thing I could do.     I got out and looked to see how bad it was and if I could get out, but the snow was way to deep for my little car.     A policeman and his family on vacation stopped after he saw me alone and that my tags showed he was from the next county over from mine. They drove me up to the next large exit which was several miles away and made sure I was ok. I was able to get a tow truck several hours later.   I just remember how bad it was because there was cars and trucks every 3-5 miles in the ditches.

It's gotten better here, used to be anytime you went out on a dance floor you could pretty well expect to be accosted by some dh stranger. Last dozen times I've been out, I only had it happen once or twice..once the guy got really mad. LOL. What a loser =)  LOL, 2 of my old dancing buddies were bi and holy hell they were worse than the guys sometimes! Get a few drinks in a girl and they get all horny and wild.

It is possible to dance and have a good time without dry humping each other. I mean really! That's what dark corners and back seats are for.      Besides, I think that there is another name for that style of dancing.  Isn't it called a lap-dance? Hmm...maybe not so bad now...|`|iT9S20zvaa	I even get embarrassed watching people do that in movies, much less in person.

They think that paying stars in the region of 50 million per film is acceptable and think that if you can't afford to see their film, then you should wait till it comes on tv.

Ignorance of the law is no excuse and piracy is illegal.     Whilst not technically being actual piracy your moral judgement should point you in the right direction on this one. It's a loophole purposely used to create a legal/ethical grey area which idiots will use to justify their actions.   If you use these sites you're encouraging illegal acts and as such you are:    A: complicit in a deliberate breach of copyright  B: scum.    So stop it and grow up people..    They'll probably get all kinds of malware/spyware/keyloggers and hopefully nasty viruses too.

Interestingly, in some species, the ants and fungi are dependent on each other for survival. The leafcutter ant is a well known example of this symbiosis.

I wish I could have helped you find "Pineapple Juice" by Andre Nickatina.  I don't believe they will be published online for another 3-4 weeks.  Good Luck!  I hope you find the answer you are looking for.
gTWgbpNFaa	its about drug taking|`|ecL0ZbfCaa	It's about Heroin, not a fat scottish guy who lives in Tony Blairs house.|`|GI27dKIkaa	FYI - It's actually "G-o-l-d-e-n Brown"    http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=oIHBUGvAUM...    Enjoy !|`|G6t2O9Kmaa	A misread song title. Its called Golden Brown, not Gordon Brown silly.    http://www.imeem.com/people/LsvJLNN/vide...|`|J8iukGsvaa	I thought the hit was called Golden Brown not Gordon Brown    the song was apparently about heroin and a girl|`|jhYUvRaDaa	I think the comparison is pretty apt because he is certainly killing our nation.   If he'd tell Brussels to P****off our lads could end this war with a press of a button.|`|DphUE9tbaa	It contains a secret spelling mistake, obviously.

GdGolvT0aa	i think it should be legal to grow it in homes in small quantities for personal use.  there's in my mind no reason to commercialise it, in stores and service station's.  a person could apply for small crop licence that would allow them access to a small number of female plant seeds only, hydro set ups would still be illegal, but coffee houses and cafes like in Amsterdam would sell pot legally along with coffee and hash cakes.  you would still have to be 18 years old to legally smoke just like with tobacco and drinking alcohol.  this way with affordable legal access the dealer would be pushed out.  if someone was caught under the influence whilst driving the same fines and chargers as drinking and driving would apply.  i myself choose to not smoke for personal reasons but that doesn't mean others should be restricted from smoking marijuana if they so choose to same with drinking i choose to not drink either but i don't care or mind if others do.|`|mjlhZAVxaa	AGAINST!  Make pot legal and we'll all have world peace ;)|`|5M0FBU89aa	Weird answer, but here goes;    Should be legalized, but against the law to smoke it.  Smoking it is an "unsafe delivery system"- dangerous, un-metered and un-scientific.    Metered Rx doses (like Marinol) would be fine, for anything from headache to Cancer.  THC has great potential medically as a CHEAP non-addictive pain killer, muscle relaxant and anti-anxiety med... No *WONDER* it's illegal... Just look to the lobbyists for Merck and GSK for that little piece of pretzel-logic.|`|73ZquQVwaa	OH! LEGALIZE IT FO SHURE!|`|mXFOru11aa	~~~~NOT AN ANSWER~~~~|`|zLGOQQs5aa	it should NOT be illegal! :) LEGALIZE ALL THE WAY BABY!!!!!!!!!|`|16rD9k32aa	I have seen the horrible addiction to it. YES! You can become addicted to pot. If not, then why in God's name would my former roommate have dumped a trash can out on the living room floor, just to find a roach that I'd thrown out?  I say leave it illegal. If you make it legal, that will just legitimize freaks like Woody Harrelson.  Besides, it's just fun to walk down the halls of a dorm and yell "DEA! Come out with your pants down!!!" and watch the mayhem...not to mention the simultaneous flushing of dozens of toilets.|`|m3ThrbDMaa	It should be legal...|`|AA11334468	Legalize it like alcohol and nicotine|`|ftZzvkNCaa	yeah it should be legal  figured the goverment would legalixze it they could tax it then|`|7XyIyNSnaa	LEGALIZE IT!|`|hIOkdSEFaa	it should be legal for the simple fact that people who use it are not selling them self for it or killing for it|`|556cc214a7493962346e6f458688b23baa	Yes. It should be legal.    A real crime is the US government protecting  Illegal aliens and  locking up US citizens for non-violent drug offenses.|`|c751f373c4b93a676106632ee074769aaa	i think people are open to alot of bad things nowadays anyways so marijuana shouldnt matter. people are gonna do it anyway though if its always going to be around.|`|2aa7f3581ca7a75ce4b41ed0be249da6aa	I'm all for it.|`|QEPC7nveaa	Against...There are many bad things about marijuana use. I feel that unless it's prescribed from the doctor it should not be legal. It acts as a type of gateway drug. My city of Vancouver is full of homeless drug addicts and many of them first started out with 'harmless' marijuana. My dad sees this everyday as he's a cop.    I also should note that most of the weed normal people buy is not just the natural leaf. There are so many chemicals added that it's ridiculous to call it natural.|`|7KZMMYjQaa	It should be legal and taxed.|`|7a00982533df23b16bd49972811d5b7faa	Are you kidding me??? I think I want it so bad I'm considering moving to Cali and developing Glaucoma! lol|`|3vDG1Fh2aa	if alcohol is legal, why can't weed be?|`|R0NfdgzLaa	for    anyone who says against should stop listening to propaganda and do some research.|`|yYr412Vbaa	Illegal..and i'm happy for that, altho it really depends on the circumstances|`|6ZkXL8mRaa	if u r asking if i am against marijuana in general..then yes. i am against it. its a drug just like any other & shud stayed outlawed.|`|e28P8gWraa	For, Itll stay this cheap.|`|KncPJwIaaa	Man should be able to partake in earth green grasses ( a quote by Superior)|`|hySFORCNaa	it should only be legal if used for medical perposes and not because you are bored and want to get high  but someones been putting poison in crack and marijuanna and coke.  and they mass produced it and lots of people have been in the hospital because they almost died so be carefull|`|61704ecd7110569d54ceeff103c4b277aa	it should be illegal.|`|Hwe4MA6Faa	Legalize it but let the government have total control and distribute/sell it in sensible portions to people with proper ID over a certain age.  I over think things...  edit: sell it cheap so the illegal pushers are vanquished.|`|b8LM28bVaa	Against! I used to smoke heavy and I loved it but I quit.If the public was high all the time nothing would get done,the economy would probably be even worse than it is now.|`|QIlhmWwBaa	Well since Michael Phelps smokes weed i would not be surprised if people from here the us are going to say it is good now|`|ij9N9r5waa	I think it should be the same as alcohol   1. sold in Liquor stores  2. must be 21 to purchase  3. no driving under the influence  4. must be in legal location,  bar, home, same place you can consume beer.|`|sxKrb98Caa	against, because if its legal then im out of a job..|`|HMUEO3NTaa	thats worded wierd... uhhh or im just high|`|uxkDrhyKaa	I am for it.|`|QdXvBOL7aa	all i know is that it should be banned|`|w6mJ9MC0aa	should be legal|`|ykCZfC3laa	its totally screws up your brain, i dint see why people would do that to them selves just to be high for a few hours.|`|5cJrnaQaaa	I dont smoke it..and i'm not really sure if i'm for or against it. i don't see really how it would affect me...but the one reason i'm sort of against it is because it's like giving in just because so many people do it. It's still a drug..even if it isn't something hardcore...  First comes that then what? legalizing drinking and driving just because so many people are doing it anyway?    Just like Star Girl said above...I live in Vancouver too and there have been documentaries on drug users in East Van..they all started with pot, then it wasn't enough, they had to try hard drugs..and now they're living on the streets.|`|cZvtNpMuaa	I don't smoke, and I hate it when people smoke around me, because I find it rude. But I do think it should be legal, it would be great for the economy, and if actually manufactuerers made it, we may weed out all the people putting random **** in it.|`|xxEYYSl9aa	legalized it and no body hurts!|`|08TabcNoaa	Legal. Cause it wont kill you. Like alcohol can, which is legal. But dont get me wrong, I do drink but still.    Have you ever read why marijuana is illegal?? If not, check that out. Pretty interesting.    What about you? What do you think about it?

What am I doing out in LA at 3:00 A.M.    Am I on drugs????|`|rL0k9trPaa	I'd probably be scared of both. but to answer th question, it all just depend on how they look.

AA11139157	i have a gemini boyfriend too- our views clash big time. gemini's views change periodically.  i am a leo and we are always debating and arguing, our viewpoints are completely different.   the best way to communicate with a gemini (in my eyes) is to make them see your point, because sometimes they don't fully understand your viewpoint either. geminis like a challenge, make them understand you, and in turn make yourself understand their viewpoint and if you beleive its not like yours just make them see where you are coming from.    you also have to see who he's hanging with, who he talks to sometimes he'll grab onto their things and bring them home with him and you'll have no clue whats going because he didn't think that way a week ago. i like it, its a challenge for me lol.     good luck to you...|`|B7WIZdglaa	scorpio/gemini is typically said to not be a good union.

ZyGyDLsDaa	Prehysteria! (1993)    starring Austin O'Brien (of "Last Action Hero" and "Lawnmower Man"), Brett Cullen, Colleen Morris, Samantha Mills, Tony Longo, Stephen Lee  IMDb synopsis:  Rico, a sleazy museum curator, steals a tribe's sacred dinosaur eggs in the rain forest. Frank is an archeologist and single parent, and eeks out a living by selling fossils from his farm to the museum. In a mixup, his kids bring home the eggs and hatch the miniature dinosaurs. Frank is falling in love with Vicki, who works for Rico, and finds his life complicated when the dinosaurs begin trashing his house, and Rico attempts to regain his treasure.   Here's the movie trailer:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVsHJrBjG...     Prehysteria! 2 (1994)  starring Kevin Connors, Dean Scofield, Bettye Ackerman, Larry Hankin, Larry Pennell, (Guiseppe) Joey Andrews  IMDb synopsis:  A rich boy desperate for attention makes friends with the dinosaurs of "Prehysteria!".       Prehysteria! 3 (1995)   starring Whitney Anderson, Owen Bush, John Fujioka, Matt Letscher, Bruce Weitz, Fred Willard  IMDb synopsis:  The dinosaurs help young Ella and her family save their miniature golf course.     It's been awhile since I've seen these movies, so I'm not sure which is the one with the train. I think the same dinosaurs appear in all three movies. A lot of people think that the third film is as good as the first one, with some liking it even more!

ZyGyDLsDaa	I found a horror film titled "Sting of Death" (1965), but I doubt that's what you are looking for. It has a man changing into a sort of jellyfish-man, and there are lots of jellies floating about. They don't mention medusae in any of the reviews. I think you'd remember this because it sounds funny/bad memorable.

Sometimes commentaries, answer questions not revealed in movies.|`|gDoKx2WIaa	I love to watch the commentary tracks. In fact the movie Cabin Fever (directed by Eli Roth) has 4 individual commentary tracks, and I've watched all 4.     I find it gives me a greater appreciation for the movies, and interesting fun facts to give my friends, ie make myself look like a complete dork. Oh well, it's my raison detre.|`|0bEH9cVUaa	Sometimes I do.|`|c3vd6UvNaa	Commentaries are excellent if they are done by the right people.  Sometimes the participants are engaging and interesting, and sometimes they really suck.    The best ones I've ever heard are from Evil Dead II, Road House (Deluxe Edition), Citizen Kane, This Is Spinal Tap, Aliens, Battlestar Galactica (any season), The Godfather DVD Collection, Se7en (Platinum Series), The Lord of the Rings Special Extended DVD Edition Trilogy (Platinum Series), and Brazil.

You can shorten it like they do on Broadway and things.  Just look at the ones playing on Broadway.

(website that lets you view commercials and gives you information about them)  They have other "Under Armour" commercials featured on that site but the one you're referring too is too recent for them to feature yet. They only have 4 commercials from 2008. But keep checking that site.  It also lets you see what actor played in a commercial if its driving you crazy, like what happens to me often!    Hope this helps!

And the way they play that song with more emphasis on the guitars and everything? Sweet.    20 Dollar Nose Bleed - Fall Out Boy  Brendon Urie and Patrick Stump. Two out of three of the best vocalists,in my opinion. The only thing that could have made this song better was William Beckett.|`|1nvCPsR6aa	I like Prince, Michael Jackson, Madonna, house, 1980s music, pop, rock and dance.

chWkFIIuaa	Truth is, Itachi didn't kill the Uchiha clan by himself to "test his abilities", but was aided by Madara as well. The real reason why he had to kill his own clan was because he was ordered by the Konoha leaders to do so.   This order was made in fear that the Uchiha clan might become too powerful and overthrow the Konoha village, therefore, eliminating the clan seemed to be the best solution for them.  So in the end, Itachi isn't actually evil, but was simply carrying out a mission. This is also evident because he was given orders to kill EVERY SINGLE Uchiha, including Sasuke, but Itachi could not bring himself to do it.|`|FTNkG7bwaa	Itachi wanted to test his potential. plus hes evil.    HES HOT...  just wanted to say that.|`|iLDullXeaa	Itachi killed everyone in his clan because he was in command of the elders like Danzo. The elders thought that the Uchiha clan was a threat to their village (or whatever), so they ordered Itachi to spy on the clan and kill everyone.|`|9CEW093maa	He performed the massacre under the orders of Konoha's leadership so as to prevent an Uchiha coup d'tat - wikipedia    Remember, in the early development of Konohagakura, the village was split in to. Followers of the first Hokage, and followers of Madara Uchiha. Itachi sparred Sasuke, not only because he couldn't bring himself to kill his little brother, but so Sasuke would grow stronger and avenge his family.    Itachi had a GREAT love for Konoha and valued it so much, he killed his entire clan to save it.|`|BPKoxVMZaa	AHHH dont say that----how can jariya die!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

vIFMK7kTaa	The Reflex Lyrics by Duran Duran. On  two albums A) Greatest and B) Decade... Greatest hits from 1981-1988.  The quote is from the start of the second verse. The song is 4:24 min. long..  Lyrics are as follows:  "You've gone too far this time"  But I'm dancing on the valentine  I tell you some body's fooling around  With my chances on the danger line  I'll cross that bridge when I find it  Another day to make my stand  High time is no time for deciding  If I should find a helping hand    CHORUS  So why don't you use it?  Try not to bruise it  Buy time don't lose it  The reflex is an only child he's waiting in the park  The reflex is in charge of finding treasure in the dark  And watching over lucky clover isn't that bizarre  Every little thing the reflex does  Leaves you answered with a question mark    I'm on a ride and I want to get off  But they won't slow down the roundabout  I sold the Renoir and the TV set  Don't want to be around when this gets out    CHORUS    Oh the reflex what a game he's hiding all the cards  The reflex is in charge of finding treasure in the dark  And watching over lucky clover isn't that bizarre  Evey little thing the reflex does  Leaves you answered with a question mark|`|eD2aQ06Aaa	I KNOW THIS I KNOW THIS...ok no i don't...|`|AA10211656	CD: Wild cow boy's in the west  SONG: I wanna get off     :D But It's kinda hard to get the cd it you want it...

klZgp2gKaa	that is entirely up to you...everyone will remember...the doctor with a wonderful singing voice...good luck...!|`|AA10488178	maybe not while you are in school and doing an internship, but if the music is in you, then you will always have time to sing.  When you are established maybe you could go to an open mic night at a local club, or sing at a karaoke bar.|`|lqR0b7WNaa	Yes you can make time...|`|abff2fd5bbf791e7eaa3e4d941a2f3bbaa	YOU COULD BE THE FIRST SINGING DOCTOR|`|XLYshMgAaa	You can always make time for anything!|`|GQoTgo70aa	i think so....because doctors will take time to rest...everybody does you can sing in your rest...or while studying...if you concentrate like this.............THE REAL Q is if you find out later that being a doctor wont give u the chance to sing are you going to quit being a doctor? besides you have to choose the best for your self and family|`|VXyzSgEwaa	Absolutely. When you go to college major in your desired field and minor in music.     Remember Phil Stacey from American Idol? He's in the U.S. Navy and look what he accomplished with his singing.|`|Y9X7DcxEaa	Maybe while studying in college you could work at a local bar as a singer for some extra $$$. When you ARE a doctor you could sing to sick patients. ;) Or, if you have New Year's parties, Christmas parties, etc with your work, you could volunteer to sing.|`|AA10560773	Yes, you'll have time to sing and or dance. You can go sing Karoke at your local bars/clubs.|`|e6795a5889aedcd8f2ba7d31a4432df8aa	yes, you can sing to your patient.  sing in the shower  sing in the car  sing in some dinner/event    you can sing anytime you want, no one stops you.  provided if you have to guts to spontaneously sing in public    i like to sing too, used to take part in competition and perform in school,   but i'm currently studying finance and economics, and that doesn't stop me from singing out loud in the car and to the radio.    if you want earn income from singing while still maintaining you career as a doctor...maybe you can sing for commercials or sth... for part time    but since you say its a hobby, then just sing whenever you want

f639092fc925bbd55e7b6272eeb17334aa	I will give you an idea but it is only fair that you pick this best answer because it will sell if you wite it fast and take advantage of the timing of things.    Think Paris Hilton, Martha Stewart, et. al and how the court systems are currently out to show that they are not soft of celebrities.    Now take a bunch of celebrities that are fet up with being role models and suddenly want to be real criminals.    They form their own little gang and start robbing people a la Jesse James and get away with it because nobody believes it is really them committing the crimes. They even stop to sign autographs as they make their getaways.     In the end, all of the crime scene footage and interviews are put together as a movie and all charges are dropped as the victims get credits and free advertisement in the movie, so even though the actors get caught they serve no time in jail and the people in office get voted out because they looked stupid on film.    This will sell, but now that you asked for it everyone on this place can beat you to the punch pitching it to a producer.|`|yJCdLNHwaa	Pirates of Transylvania:    Pirates seek a hideout and come upon what seems to a deserted  castle in Transylvania. That night the guard is found missing. The others search to no avail. The next night the second guard dissapears. The leader Blake "Snake" Baird takes his men back to their ship. He knows something is wrong.     The night grows dark as the moon is shrouded with dark shapes soaring through the sky. Soon pirates begin screaming and Snake comes on deck only to be hauled off his feet by his first mate.    Here is where you can continue.|`|4e0e4a6df72e5b5fc10913841a6b753daa	I don't really know, but I've always wanted to be an actress...    so an idea is that u make a film on someone who saw far into the future and nobody believed in what the person saw in his/her visions    or u can make a film on a person who invented robots    or something... what r u interested in?|`|be324679c9c62fa9753cda7182a0302eaa	Hi, I am a filmmaker as well! I just finished two feature length screenplays, and the only advice I can give to you is BE ORIGINAL! The last screenplay I wrote, called Darsomica is actually being looked at by Lionsgate Films ( Well, I just got lucky there because I have a friend who works for them!) ! If you need any pointers, you are free to e-mail me. What genre are you looking at?|`|VMBwVUacaa	Yea like anyone is just going to give away their ideas to you for free so you can make a movie about it & get money. I don't think so! Why don't you try using your brain like every other dumb@ss out there.|`|INiKpE5Laa	Okay, congrats on being a film maker. It's a pretty hard business to break into.    I myself am an aspiring screenwriter.    I don't know if you just want to be a director, or want to write your own movies yourself.    I think your best bet would be to hire a screenwriter for cheap, and have them write a general script for you. That way you don't have to take the time and energy into writing it when you could have a talented screenwriter for you. That way you can focus on getting funds, actors, etc.    Oh, and I am a Screenwriter so if you need help with writing your script if you're doing it please feel free to email me at:    You_Clipped_My_Angel_Wings  @yahoo.com    Or if you just feel like talking. I am open to meeting people in the business. I hope this answer helped you!

f9a9998f24db17292fa9f78df9347c9eaa	Well davy jones had to call off the craken because that british guy told him to because he had davy jone's heart. now the movie says that whoever has the heart can control davy jones. so that explains why the kraken is dead. calypso was bound to a human body because she fell in love with the mortal davy jones. but she wanted to test him if his love was true. she put the curse on him( the curse that made him like a sea creature) and set him off to sea, and then he could not come on land for 10 years and only one night after ten years can he return to see calypso. but instead of her waiting she did not see his return. she wanted to wait another ten years to see if he still loved her. if he came back then the curse would be broken but he did not. so he was forever cursed that way. when she cursed him she lost her powers and became almost human  the nine pirate lords bound her with a rope but she couldn't escape because she was mortal still. she did have power yes but she did not have enough to break free. which is why they have to burn some things and say calypso I release you of your human form. so that meant that she could beccome a goddess again.|`|24c7fe4040b70c9ad53abaa216581c41aa	i think jack sparrow kills the kraaken|`|1921c7686b6c5636b4cf67d08717d89eaa	As for the first question, no idea. As for Calypso, it's a dang story. I just accepted it and moved on. XD|`|XvgKKijyaa	1. Davy Jones was forced to kill it or else his heart would be destroyed    2. don't no about calypso|`|d78d50485ca365a0e8deecc7fe04d11caa	As for the Kraken, Cutler Becket says quite plainly that he forced Davy Jones to Kill the Kraken.     I'm not sure about Calypso, but i am certain that the answer to that question lies in the dialogue of the movie, as does the Kraken answer.|`|e6795a5889aedcd8f2ba7d31a4432df8aa	The Lord Beckett ordered Davi Jones to kill the Kraken so that Davy Jones couldn't use it against him, since Beckett already has Davy Jone's heart in his hand, he'll have to follow all of his orders.    It was Davy Jones who told the Brethen Court how to trapped Calypso in human form so that they can control the sea, mainly because Calypso broke her promise in meeting him during his 1 yr on land out of the 10 yrs at sea.    I didn't know that actually, happen to found out from Wikipedia

The Scarlett Letter is about love. Plain and simple. She was willing to risk her life to hide who her lover was. The character was well ahead of her time. But, yes, I would have to giggle a bit if I had to read that particular paragraph out loud. :)|`|H8OmFZbkaa	The Scarlet Letter has a great storyline... It's an amazing love story about two lovers who cannot be together because society forbids them to be. It is about an independent woman who stands up to society. Yes that paragraph would make me feel a bit foolish but, please give the novel a try, it really is a great read.
db3b66826b3823af36292042307c965daa	From what I have seen and read they seem to get along very well.  It was important to Bob that they know and respect each other.

AA12278670	Principal is representation of your subconscious as the authority on what you should already know. You are the representation of desperate hope. The Ex is the representation of the nagging feeling you want to beat down because you want to cling to your hopes, that's why you are struggling in you dream to be the one in the "right". Your subconscious is trying to tell you to give up on him.|`|yJCdLNHwaa	You might be feeling like your BF is ignoring you and you might be afraid that he will dump you for his ex or somebody new.

db3b66826b3823af36292042307c965daa	My favorite Bob Marley song is "War."  His life is an example of what we all should strive for.  He was a pioneer of music from humble beginnings who made it on his own merit.  He was devoted to his religious beliefs and stood up for those with no voice.  The legacy of Bob Marley will continue to inspire people around the world for as long as human kind exists.        "My music will go on forever. Maybe it's a fool say that, but when me know facts me can say facts. My music will go on forever."

db3b66826b3823af36292042307c965daa	My interpretation is that the "big tree" is the system or government.    Arrogance and deceit are the means of the system to acheive an end that is the acquisition wealth and power.  The "small axe" refers to the people oppressed by this system.  "Ready to cut you down" is the chipping away of the powers that be by the individual backed by the strength of the almighty Jah (God).    In the end Babylon will fall because of its own arrogance.  This is really simplified but I hope it helps.        Why boasteth thyself  Oh, evil men  Playing smart  And not being clever?  I said, you're working iniquity  To achieve vanity (if a-so a-so)  But the goodness of jah, jah  I-dureth for-i-ver    So if you are the big tree  We are the small axe  Ready to cut you down (well sharp)  To cut you down    These are the words  Of my master, keep on tellin' me  No weak heart  Shall prosper  And whosoever diggeth a pit  Shall fall in it, fall in it  And whosoever diggeth a pit  Shall fall in it (... fall in it)    If you are the big tree, let me tell you that  We are the small axe, sharp and ready  Ready to cut you down (well sharp)  To cut you down    (to cut you down)    (to cut you down)    These are the words  Of my master, tellin' me that  No weak heart  Shall prosper  And whosoever diggeth a pit  Shall fall in it, uh, bury in it  And whosoever diggeth a pit  Shall bury in it, uh (... bury in it)    If you are the big, big tree  We are the small axe  Ready to cut you down (well sharp)  To cut you down  If you are the big, big tree, let me tell you that  We are the small axe  Ready to cut you down (well sharp)  To cut you down  Sharpened ...

b9b12ba7c86886ed100410f02af9e91aaa	I drove my daughter to school and she never even said goodbye...she ran right to the line of kids beside her teacher. I managed to mumble (through my tears) that I'd pick her up after school and she told me she wanted to take the bus...I went home to cry and tried to keep myself busy for the rest of the day (beside the phone).  You aren't alone...it's hard to let go of our babes, hang in there!  ;)|`|JhD8zP71aa	i sent them off, went home and had a bath and a nap. it was loverly...|`|fDdFtntYaa	Awww.  We took "first day of school ever" pictures, made sure they looked spiffy...walked them down to their bus stop and waited with them.  Then when they got on the bus and left, we were sad a bit, our babies were growing up.  But it did pass, because when they came home they were excited and happy and they loved it.    So just take a deep breath, savor the moment, cling to the sadness for a while, and just realize that your kids are growing up, and pretty soon they'll be moving out!  :-)|`|dDmGGHs6aa	I really was nervous on all 3 of my kids first day, but I didn't say it to them. I just told them they were so big and that they were going to have such a  fun adventure! I always write them little notes they can read when they have a snack like SMILE! Have a fun day! etc..I also made myself available to the teacher for volunteering in the classroom and even the school so I could still see what was going on and be accessible if they needed me. Even if you work you could arrange a day a month to volunteer in the classroom. It is truly impressive to see and help what they do.    **If you are going back to work give your child a little card or paper that they can keep your number inside their school bag  though it will be the school calling it gives them the security that if they needed to call you they have the number!  If your child is going to take the bus DO TAKE PICTURES of them at the bus stop, getting on the bus( call their name and snap a pic it is sure to get an interesting expression), and as they are leaving looking out the window(keep your chin up though don't let them see your tears you can weep after they are out of sight.) Also take a picture of them  getting off the bus at home time.  **If you work try and arrange a day off for the first day/ go in late so you can see them off yourself or get your spouse/daycare provider to take the pictures for you!  Just for re-assurance for yourself/child any important information that you really want to make double sure they have write it down and hand deliver it to the school. They probably have all your information, but it is much more comfortable to have double checked for your sanity and your child's safety. If there is any tips about insecurities or to know your child better or even little concerns address it right away with the teacher and send a note along with your child the first day and request a phone call.  It will go surprising well for them at school! They are preoccupied by new things, friends and routines it goes by so fast for them, then they are home and sleepy! You will wonder what all the worry was about, and you will finally be able wind down for the night yourself and tackle another day! The first day is the hardest(for you)and then it just becomes routine!    All the best! I hope this helps! You will do great!|`|a069e9067627f183dfb36a948494aea1aa	My kid is in her third year of college and I still remember her first day of kindergarten.  I just sat there in the car for a few minutes.  I guess just in case there was a problem.    If you let him/her see that you are nervous then you will scare the begeebies out of your little one.    It's a big step, and it has to be done. Just do it !    Maybe keep thinking about the conversations the two of you will have afer school.

Add more, the teacher will LOVE that.  --------------------------------------...  I wonder- whether I'll have a great 1st year of high school.  I hear my dog's barking. really.

In my opinion, women (myself included) are drawn to their carefree and risk-taking nature as well as spontaneity. Bad boys are also unabashed about their actions, which can sometimes be equated to strength of character.|`|AA11788591	their either sorta dumb or they like the risk in it. or they want to think that they can change him.    i find 'bad boys' quite immature|`|7d5ec5e53039b237fbb5c9d8ffa0e9f3aa	Take this from a girl "i hate bad boys"    They act like 4 year olds and that is sucks!!    The sensetive its a bit better beauce they understand you!!  but a mix of both aint bad!|`|AA11921177	Trying to steal my "curious" title, huh?    hehe, just kidding.    I think it's not really the whole "cheating on their gfs" thing that the girls go for, but more or less, the confidence and carefreeness as well as the spontaneity. It's the personality. Also, sometimes girls are often limited and they think that a "bad boy" will make themselves feel more sponatenous or something. Just what I think. Personally, sensitive guys are usually the sweeter kind, i'm not all for the whole cheating lifestyle. Now if you're wondering why some girls are with cheaters, either they don't realize that guys are usually "once a cheater, always a cheater" or are just not so smart.|`|92106e9af0237649a4e844f66cfd557faa	many of us girls unfortunately think that we can change them. we sometimes think we will be that girl that they chaged for, but it rarely happens like u said. i've liked bad boys until this past yr. when i finally fell for someone who was worth it my pov. he is the sensetive type. i think he's great. sensitive guys are worth more than bad boys. i think in the end they can bring more to a gal than just looks which is what bad boys usually always and only bring. now i try not to go for those guys, but sometimes you can control what your feelings dictate. mix that with and u end up with a person who is blind in "love" with the wrong person.you can't choose who to love.|`|Kq7yuGT9aa	you'll get her in the end|`|VGKrNULzaa	I have no idea. I am far from sensitive and have been faithful to my wife since I met her. Sixteen years we've been together.|`|FnjMXIZRaa	You know, there actually is an in-between category...I think that's actually what a lot of women go for, if you can find one of them....You know, the kind of guy who isn't all sensitive and sissy-like, is strong and manly and maybe a little bit on the wild side, but isn't a party animal or a cheater....It's hard to find, and the bad boy extreme is usually more exciting than the sensitive extreme, so I guess that would be why they go more for one than the other most of the time.|`|DbTPkXa8aa	idk, cuz theyre braindead?    ive never had interest in "bad boys" & probly never will. i prefer a goody-2-shoes like me.    as 4 cheaters, they really creep me out. its creepy just how heartless some ppl can b.|`|AA12373016	I have always wondered that!!!

The only thing you can do is write to him/her & send it to the studio in which he/she uses. Whether its paramount, Disney, MGM, just to name a few. You will not get an actual address from them though. Personally I know that Julia Roberts has a home in Toas, NM. Patrick Swayze has a home in Northern NM & if you know him Judge Reinhold has a home in Rio Rancho,NM, he used to attend my church while he was at home here in NM. I have not seen him in a few years so I don't know if he still attneds. Good Luck to you though.   :)

ISPUBYpRaa	There are a lot of shows that will be premiering in the next couple of weeks, and the people behind those shows are worried that they'll be lost in the shuffle.  Consequently, they promote the shows in whatever way they can.  Last year I was sent a DVD with the pilot episodes of a handful of Fox shows and I rented the pilot episode of Kidnapped on Netflix before it was officially premiered.  This year NBC is releasing some of its pilot episodes for new shows on Amazon unboxed, and apparently Gossip Girl is on itunes.  You can probably find more shows' pilot episodes out there if you look.    What TPTB are hoping is that you'll love the pilot episode so much that you will be hooked and will watch all of the other episodes, whereas you might not have gotten to see the pilot against other shows if they hadn't done so.  I think the jury is still out on whether it is an effective technique, but that doesn't stop people from trying to do whatever they can to get their show noticed in this crowded landscape.  Shows aimed towards a target audience of young, technologically-savvy people (such as Gossip Girls) are probably more likely to try the online screening method.|`|987e74be97a10a494830a7c473b7c8b0aa	they did the smae thing iwth greek and cory in the house. its just publicity.|`|bc59c3f7e93a09af3d8298fe3b2885cfaa	i guess its for people who would rather pay to see it before others??|`|532614f016b99a2f7f7eb577784c267caa	They always do that!  I dunno why, it is just the pilot, which is basically just a test to see if the show will make it!  But Gossip Girl does premier on the 19th, no worries, you didn't miss it!!!!!!!  I am excited 2!!!!!      XOXO I

B5jmkdyGaa	yes, years ago i dreamt i went to a funeral home everything was red and green. i walked in and saw the casket at a distance, i walked towards the body and noticed it was on its side as i got closer each step i took the body turned towards me. when i got right up next to the casket i realized it was me looking at me..i woke up in a cold sweat.|`|S94wH2EKaa	Yes, but first I always die skydiving and then those dreams start to come.

Ma mi vien da dire: dipende in che modo decidi di rischiare. Se investo tutti i miei soldi nella speranza di vincere al lotto cifre miliardarie ho un minimo di possibilit di "volare" e un bel tot di possibilit di "sfracellarmi".   Cos come se decido di rischiare lanciandomi a tutta velocit su un rettilineo, per vedere se sono capace a frenare in tempo e a dimostrare a me stesso e ad altri di avere coraggio.  Se invece credo alla forza di un bel sogno sano, investo le mie energie, mantenendo per il dominio di me stessa, mettendo davanti le mie emozioni ma con le dovute cautele razionali....beh, allora s, sono d'accordo. Perch poi arrivi a realizzare un bel sogno, ti senti realizzato e questo ti d lo stimolo per volare verso altri obiettivi.  Il coraggio di rischiare in amore ci vuole, ma solo se si ama veramente e se si pu capire con un certo anticipo se la persona che abbiamo davanti se lo merita e non ci condurr sull'orlo del baratro. Se no sarebbe, pi che volare alto, un altro andarsi a sfracellare.|`|FOuZThzQaa	E' bellissima la canzone, e poi questa frase  semplicemente stupenda...

AA10148336	I believe the Black water guards because the are trained professionals and are the ones on the ground being shot at on a daily basis.

Un'unione tra i due rappresenta l'associazione tra due persone efficienti che riescono ad aumentare la loro fortuna nel corso del tempo. L'unico inconveniente e' che la Vergine e' normalmente poco appariscente e preferisce mantenere i suoi sentimenti riservati, mentre il Toro sguazza nelle emozioni profonde.      Una prematura passione potrebbe coinvolgere i due segni, soprattutto per il fascino della Vergine. Ma il Toro  un carattere che non ama le critiche, che invece sono l 'arma pi usata dalla Vergine. Attenzione allora...|`|LrzqGkvlaa	Io sono toro......e non sono pi vergine!!!|`|dKzmauGbaa	Se lei  della Vergine e lui  del Toro non  molto probabile che il primo incontro sia un colpo di fulmine: nessuno dei due ha un temperamento ardente o precipitoso. Lei non permette mai alle emozioni di prendere il sopravvento ed  ben decisa a mettere in funzione il cervello molto prima del cuore quando si tratta di valutare un possibile partner. Lui  molto pi affettuoso e bonaccione, ma i suoi sentimenti si formano lentamente, con placida profondit, e ha bisogno di molto tempo prima di potersi avvicinare ad una persona quanto basta per poterle fare delle avances. Perci nei primi tempi si studieranno cautamente, lei con una punta di diffidenza, lui con bonaria attenzione; non hanno nessuna fretta di spingere il loro rapporto verso qualcosa di pi coinvolgente, perci i loro primi appuntamenti saranno distanziati nel tempo e verteranno intorno a qualcosa di concreto da fare insieme, possibilmente in seno alla natura, che entrambi apprezzano e conoscono profondamente. Dopo diverse domeniche trascorse a cercare funghi, castagne o fiordalisi, piano piano cominceranno a sentirsi sempre piu in confidenza; lui manifester il suo affetto sotto forma di calore e tenerezza fisica, mentre lei, che  una donna efficiente e organizzata, sar la prima a parlare di decisioni concrete o di matrimonio. E poich entrambi sono affidabili e corretti, la loro sar un'unione tranquilla e costruttiva, coronata da un solido benessere economico.|`|tLAk2dQGaa	Sarebbe importante sapere gli  Ascendenti, ma anche cos possono nascere delle idee utili per un confronto.  Il nato nel Toro ha in realt poco del suo segno,  pi caratterizzato da una predominanza nel segno del Capricorno, specialmente per quanto riguarda il suo umore e la sua voglia di vivere, meno da gaudente, con pi equilibrio. Il Capricorno riduce la voglia di spese pazze del Toro, lo rende pi parsimonioso, ma in compenso gli d lambizione, quindi  facile che si concentri su un solo bersaglio amoroso e per quella persona spenda molto e bene per impressionarla. Gelosia e possessivit saranno sue compagne, insieme ad una forte spinta verso la soddisfazione dei bisogni elementari, soprattutto a tavola e a letto. Attenzione, Venere in Ariete gli d dei colpi di matto improvvisi che spiazzano anche chi ci sta insieme da sempre ma anche una 'botta di vita' che ogni tanto non guasta. In sostanza, ama la vita e chi gli sta vicino, ma non lo dir apertamente, essendo di natura poco espansivo, preferisce dimostrarlo con cose materiali, come regali, vestiti, gioielli, viaggi.  La nata nel segno della Vergine ha anche lei poco del suo segno,  pi orientata verso la Bilancia. Chiede un rapporto a due esclusivo, nel quale crede molto e che riempie di romanticismo. Ama esser corteggiata e sa come gestire il tutto con femminilit e charme. Non accetta i tradimenti, che feriscono per sempre un rapporto e distruggono la fiducia. Vuole impegno e cerca la bellezza, non solo quella fisica, anche se per lei conta molto. Un rapporto amoroso per lei potrebbe partire prima da unamicizia, in quel caso cercherebbe di mantenerla anche in seguito. Anche lei sente la spinta dei bisogni elementari, per  pi raffinata, controllata e anche un po timida, ha bisogno che sia lui a condurre le danze. Si muove molto bene, con eleganza, facilmente colpisce lattenzione dellaltro sesso con il suo modo di parlare e di porsi, senza mettersi tanto in mostra. Attenzione agli sbalzi dumore che possono creare irritabilit, se si sente attaccata ribatte criticando e giudicando a sua volta.  In conclusione, lui e lei si trovano bene sul piano fisico, meno bene su quello emotivo, dove ci sono pi difficolt ad intuire cosa sente laltro. Si capiscono sullimportanza di certi valori e sui beni materiali, possono condividere anche un certo modo di ragionare, stando alla larga da posizioni troppo forti o estremiste. Lui potrebbe essere meno possessivo e lei meno puntigliosa. Se si impegnano a superare i punti di attrito, potrebbe essere un rapporto interessante e coinvolgente. Auguri!|`|zdkwHK6naa	ciao ... la coppia xfetta...fidati!!!!!!ciao e auguri  complicit,divertimento,non possono stare lontani.........

She's acted in movies like Joan of Ark.|`|Mh37cOGEaa	Johnny Depp.   I never really like him but after realizing that he NEVER plays the same part in a movie (he's so versatile) I started to think he was an amazing actor.  He's amazing in every movie.    I wouldn't say that they are mind-rotting... people need entertainment and they provide that for us :)|`|a069e9067627f183dfb36a948494aea1aa	Nicole Kidman.

ZVXG6ajEaa	It's because they get the wrong message. They think that since they're Christian, that they automatically have God's judging powers. Stuck-up/uptight/super christians really messed up the image for you guys. I used to be able to go to church but now I just can't because if they knew that I'm gay, they'd probably point and stare, and maybe even kick me out.|`|r63cf0JGaa	cuz they by crazy|`|S94wH2EKaa	I don't know. Maybe they think that religion makes them better in status than everyone else or they were just raised wrong. For every religion (probably), there's going to be people there that are really stuck up sadly enough.|`|d759a5d5755c3cee2925fe6f7160c2f2aa	maybe it's time to stop going to church. You're not gonna go to hell if you stop going...that's just what they want you to think.|`|eec1c26911b3820fb5e5edd1276d26d9aa	I think you could simply ask "how come some people are uptight?" there are some uptight people and that's just how it is.|`|hkswaTiQaa	it's because they are brainwashed.  and hypocrits...end of story.|`|Iws6kykqaa	- I'm a Christian Too :]  There are alot of people like that at my church, as well.  If it's possible, I think some people take their religion to the Extreme.. I know people around me do.    You're probably like, "Huh?" lol But I think they get so caught up in doing what they think is right in their own little world that they think they're better than everyone else.

Lately though, it's starting to seem like I get depressed for no reason sometimes. I think it's mood swings but it could be something different.
B01Qv9gUaa	What do you mean "outside religion"? If you mean have I ever dated someone who didn't have a religion...yes.

My current bf and I have different religions. (I'm Christian, and he's Hindu.)    Wow, I misread your question. I read it as "have you ever dated someone outside of your religion".    No, I've not dated anyone who was outside religion.

0wr04D57aa	The scene originally had Hinata in the spot where the girl is. You'll notice the headband is around her neck, just like Hinata. They gave her Sakura's hair, but made it gray.

C2DBglhnaa	Where did you hear that Slash was releasing a new album? Are you sure it's coming out?
d8293baa218825d8e15b4ebf9f5e4e20aa	This new generation of yours is missing out on a big part of film history by dismissing older black & white films...the best films ever made are b&w and made these newer high-tech films today possible. In any event, "Psycho" was a ground-breaking film at the time...it was one of the 1st, if not THE 1st, slasher film ever made. It and the original "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" from 1972 started the "Slasher" genre! So of course it does not follow 'classic Hollywood conventions'(ways of doing things). We never saw a cross-dressing character before(if you don't count "Glen or Glenda"), and the very notion of an "Insane" murderer brought a new face to horror movies...after that, we rarely saw 'Monsters' like Frankenstein again.|`|fZw6ImUGaa	The thing about Pscho is that it is basically Hitch's attempt to integrate the then increasingly popular b horror movies, particularly those of William Castle, to mainstream Hollywood. So in terms of style it owes more to those people than to classic hollywood. secondly, for me Psycho works only for the first time as it breakls with a main convention in writing. We watch the story of a young woman for most of the time and then she gets brutally murdered. That has never happened before. But you actually remember the last quarter of the movie abour Norman bates. so if you watch it for a second time you realize that the red herring actually takes up more time than the stgory itself. Again, this is something I have not seen in another film and if it wasn't for the strong shock effects of the last bit of the film it would probably be considered bad writing and a lack of focus.|`|4x2KMVbBaa	Not Hitchcock's best movie, but probably his most famous. The sex and violence seem tame today, but with Psycho, Hitchcock broke longstanding Hollywood taboos and invented the psychological thriller. Groundbreaking then, it's dated and a little campy now, but still fun. Janet Leigh is gorgeous, Anthony Perkins is creepy, and Psycho still delivers some satisfying shocks.|`|dbYeN3hlaa	what ??its in black en white?...i was going to watch it until i seen the black and white part ..|`|k9zRvawRaa	maybe you're suppose to answer if the film answer's to the agreements of classical hollywood conventions?     agreements means conventions vice versa.    i do not understand your question to be honest.    but i hope i could of cleared something up.

NwT6CpRUaa	Headbanging is a type of dance which involves violently shaking the head in time with music, most commonly rock music and heavy metal music.    The term "headbanger" was coined during Led Zeppelin's first US tour in 1968. During a show at the Boston Tea Party, audience members in the first row were banging their heads against the stage in rhythm with the music.    Lemmy from Mot?rhead, however, said in an interview on the documentary The Decline of Western Civilization II: The Metal Years, that the term "Headbanger" may have originated in the band's name, as in "Motorheadbanger". But this is merely speculation and hasn't been proven as of yet.|`|Lngb8ryFaa	the Blue Man Group calls it "Rock Concert Movement  2"...along with the fist pump..LOL, love the BMG!!!!|`|dvUS0HHXaa	It's called headbanging.

What makes civil engineering just for guys?  They don't do any heavy lifting in civil engineering or anything physical.  All it is, is just physics and math.

If you are looking for something a bit darker, try JR Ward's Black Dagger Brotherhood series.     Kim Harrison's The Hollows series follows a witch named Rachel Morgan and has all sorts of different paranormal things, including vampires.

dvUS0HHXaa	It will, as picks are designed to be relatively straight. Personally if I were you I would just buy a pack of new ones, it will certainly be better for your playing.    If you want you could just try and bend it back and it may be alright but really it is just a pick, it is no big deal.    Hope this helps :)    Edit: Jimmygdsn, you say you own two bass guitars but you can't spell bass properly?|`|2k8TEiRtaa	funny, but I've never bent a pick in my life. I've broken the tip of many. Sometimes in the middle of a riff or instrumental. But I hold the pick pretty close where it feels more comfortable. A little sideways. Just a tad.|`|F62bnqqjaa	if it really bothers you, go to your local guitar shop and get the 36 pack for like 5 bucks or whatever, theyre just picks|`|NofRnN61aa	Yes, very much so, but a metal pick.  They sound great, are cheap (not as cheap as plastic ones but they last much longer than plastics so they're worth it). But a bent plastic one sounds horrible. Surely you can hear if its affected your performance when you listen to yourself play?|`|8ef4b416785d26c0bcbfb62eec999300aa	yes! throw it away. the way to stop having a pick bend is to use the wright pick. i have been playing for 49 years, and have spent a small fortune on accessories, picks and no telling the sets of strings. you learn over time. if you will buy dunlop picks your troubles are over. i use a .60mm for strumming, and a stiffer one for picking. go to a music store and try the feel of all different mm of picks. they are, without a doubt, the best made. my son and daughter both play very well, and we play all the time. i buy the picks by the gross, and strings, 3 dozen at the time.  3 dozen for electric, and 3 for accoustic. by the way, i own 6 accoustic, and 7 electric, plus a 4 string base, and a 5 string base. have complete recording studio in my back yard. loads of fun. i do understand that you didn't ask for all of this, but it does shine a little light on my knowledge of picks. by the way, my band did a warm up show for george strait, in concert, back in 1982.  "KEEP ON PLAYING'|`|0ZxYrtv0aa	Yeah, I'd say you should get a new one. Picks come in all different sizes.

gf9twU8taa	This is taken from Wikipedia:    Up-and-coming singer BC Jean, who wrote most part of the song's lyrics, took inspiration in writing "If I Were a Boy" out from a bad break-up. Jean and producer Toby Gad were strolling in Times Square when the former saw hot dogs that enticed her being peddled on the street. According to Del Mar Times, "Jean was lamenting about how she was trying to stay away from [it] and noted how if she were a boy, she could probably eat one without regrets. That led to her musing on how if she were a boy, she'd be so much better than her ex." Gad asked Jean to "repeat her sentiments into a recorder". They returned to the studio and wrote the song in 15 minutes. Jean recorded her version of the song.    In her MySpace account, Knowles comments on the song: "You can hear with 'If I Were a Boy', it's not a traditional R&B song. It's difficult to grow and to break out and do new things because people have strong expectations. I feel like at this point, I wanted people to hear songs with stronger lyrics and songs that made you feel. I love singing ballads because I feel like the music and the emotion in the story is told so much better. It's a better connection because you can hear it and it's not all these other distractions. I really wanted people to hear my voice and hear what I had to say."    And for the music video:  The music video for "If I Were a Boy", directed by Jake Nava, was shot in black and white and portrays a narrative about an ordinary day for a couple in a role reversal that is hinted at by the lyrics but is visually revealed only at the end of the video. It begins with Knowles and her husband reciting words such as "intimacy", "honesty", and "commitment." The song starts as her husband prepares breakfast and Knowles takes off to her job as police officer with an attractive male police partner with whom the sparks are clearly flying. While her curves are admired by the police partner, her husband is spending time at his office job looking up a pair of earrings to buy for her online. The husband calls Knowles, only to be ignored by his wife, who is out having a beer "with the guys." That night the husband gives Knowles the earrings and the two leave for a party at which he catches her dancing intimately with her police partner. As the husband confronts her at home, the reversal is revealed and roles are restored; we learn that the husband is actually the police officer with an attractive female partner. Knowles is the office worker who has been snubbed.|`|1SnI86BIaa	its a horrible song    that was written by some writters that have no clue what theyre doing, so beyonces doesnt have to do any work|`|0fe80488b8a162aba1630f909af2cbb1aa	She's basically putting herself in her flirty bf's shoes. Kinda like seeing it from his POV where he doesn't think he did anything wrong. And its basically saying that if SHE was the boy, she wouldn't have to care cuz she can just hang out with the boys and do whatever she wants. It is really pointing out the double standard in our society where men can do certain stuff and admired and praised for it while women get called whores. And that women with men who are taking advantage of this double standard are really hurting.|`|eW41wwCPaa	She was saying if she were a boy she would treat a girl the way she wanted or the way a girl would want|`|TQ6JG5V3aa	The whole song is basically about how her boyfriend is screwing her over, so she is bitching about him saying 'If I were a boy, I'd sleep with other girls, play around, come home late etc' cos that is what HE is doing to HER. The whole video is about how SHE is acting like the man, doing what she wants, screwing around, flirting with other men etc, but then when she says "It's not like I' sleeping with the guy' and then he says the same thing, it shows that all along things weren't as they seemed. She wasn't the one who was playing around, he was. It's all about how guys think they can get away with stuff, but how would they like it if their girlfriend did it to them? It's really clever...|`|2TiwAfPvaa	Iunno But Someone Needs To Shut That ***** Up.    Trying to get us in trouble...

AA11900717	Ugh I wanna slap her. Personally I think she never should've had the in-vitro in the first place. She already had six kids and isn't married plus living with her parents. I think they should've looked at her situation before giving her more babies to implant.|`|gf9twU8taa	As a mother of 14 children and the second time in history octuplets have survived, she is bound to attract a lot of publicity. The media reports have been constant and I'm sure reporters and journalists have been at her door almost everyday. I don't doubt that television networks may have approached her to do a series too, considering the success of Jon and Kate + 8, 17 Kids and Counting, etc.    I think it's actually appropriate for her to hire a PR firm. Her intention may not be to generate publicity for her children, but to contain the publicity and ensure that her family gets the peace and quiet they deserve instead of dealing with all the ruckus.     This kind of story creates buzz and people like to hear about it and read about it. There's probably a lot they don't know about, not only with having 14 children but how to deal with the media and to understand who to trust. Hiring a PR firm may be the smartest thing they do especially with today's gossip craze and media saturation.    ...And imagine how much it's going to cost her to raise 14 kids. This will financially support her and possibly give her additional assistance too. Consider this exploitation or not, this is her life. She gets to choose and people will buy into it. Blame our society for letting this become a possibility (and potentially encouraging this choice to be made).|`|bc1af16c01f9baa9730a6de2c0ca235caa	Right...this ***** is outrageous to say the least
XeR3oN0aaa	Movies that you should watch more than one ...  The Prestige - even though you could watch it a million times if you are like me you change your mind about it and how the plot works every time and therefore it doesn't become boring.  Titanic - the emotion always effects you regardless of how many times you have seen it.  Gladiator - same reason as titanic.  i totally agree with the whole problem of action and horror movies etc.  Secret Window is sometimes good to watch again particularly if you watch it with someone who has never seen it because you get to be constantly amused by their ignorance throughout the movie.  Action films (sort of) could include Blood Diamond because it also has a great storyline aside from the action stuff.  In my opinion films like Troy, Kingdom of Heaven (big epics) etc are always worth re watching because the characters are always so amazing, the actors so intense and the script so well written and usually so long that you are bound to miss something or not fully appreciate something the first time round and if you enjoyed it the first time you are bound to never get bored of it.  Also Haven just because it is great!  Hope this helps!|`|FF9mMlgKaa	you need to see the movie Talk Radio.

I'm good.|`|yU6T1q0taa	Yes, I have one.  I like it fairly well.  So no, I don't want one.|`|zozNBHcJaa	Its a funny story how I got my nickname...Taiju. I was originally T.J. and still am to most of my friends. But one day one of my friends made the dots too big so they looked like little o's: ToJo. So I was Tojo for a while, which then turned to Taj after all of us watching Van Wilder: The Rise of Taj. It finally came to Taiju after watching a couple of animes and some thinking and ramen.|`|AA11900717	I get called Shorty and Kid a lot.

qWqg7vFJaa	Not if I can get away with it..|`|0l1hvLf9aa	at times i do but the universal truth is 'rules are made to be broken.'|`|5uySCrYUaa	hey you need to be more clear on rules? What kind? Is it part of a game? the law or something else. You cant just give a one-liner question, people won know what you are asking for...|`|McHgAWf0aa	It depends.mainly I don't but at school I try to get along.|`|I2Gsu4tMaa	Haha.  No.|`|SpGtU5TRaa	I pretty much do what I think is right and acceptable, completely ignoring rules on purpose.  Sometimes rules can be absurd.|`|4vO41XV5aa	sometimes|`|eQAEnmOPaa	Pfffftttt...    If you follow the rules, you never have any fun.|`|FXD0rHyzaa	i dislike following rules   it makes me feel like another sheep to society  but i dont break the rules extremely like you see all these yobs/chavs/youths running about causing havoc    i just dislike being told what to do but i suppose im your average 15 year old going through a rebelious stage XD haha which seems to be lasting for 15 years|`|nCrbKAuzaa	there are instances that i'm following rules. it will really depend on the rule and the situation though.|`|2fa78c2dc1b3731f2dc44586207e59dfaa	depends... i try to but sometimes i just gotta break them!|`|LoRgAmc6aa	very seldom ... I usually do as I please.|`|j6RbKNmjaa	Sometimes I do|`|7HbaDLUNaa	Most of the time, unless the rules are one sided  (s)|`|bc1af16c01f9baa9730a6de2c0ca235caa	almost never|`|7hrOjPwjaa	I like to bend rules.

0ZM3TCXCaa	I think that it is a love song too. I think that it is about when we fall in love with someone, we are taking a chance "cause we are led to the edge" we either choose to stay on the edge, or take a chance on love and jump. I think it is about falling in love with someone and what it feels like to fall hard for someone, and also what happens when we fall and hit the ground, hard as it didn't work out in the end- causing our scars, but no matter what, we are led to the edge and choose to jump and fall in love again and feel tat rush.
WXAoSr49aa	yeh... its a shame i've got lots of chavs in my school...couldn't imagine what it would be like in the future..urgh!|`|FYjf7hkEaa	They are vile creatures who cant afford cars, so im not suprised.  On the plus side, they will be sorry sights in 20 years from now.|`|tIj5bDRNaa	2 words!.......compulsory sterilization!!!|`|U3qTwOOIaa	they can't afford cars cos they spend all their benefit money on tacky gold jewellery, fake designer clothing and booze|`|f6A6UM2taa	yeah most chavs uses buses as they cant afford cars! lol|`|zDf186Xyaa	You shouldve told them, i only let OAP sit on this seat, so your not included! hehe|`|081NXWAeaa	not alot but i hav seen them on buses b4      http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...|`|hsyI1DxDaa	Chavs shouldn't be allowed to breathe or breed. They're the main reason of the horribly high teenage pregnancies..    A lot of them use buses. They're pretty much on every single public transport you can think of.|`|6HIuqEUyaa	Yeh(:|`|iTa38Xkdaa	So, there is just as many other people who use the bus.

Who the hell did she think she was askin u to move, kids are not thats just damn rude!!!  They use buses coz the majority of them have kids at like 13 ( not sayin every1 who has kids young are chavs by the way) so they dont eva have to work and can live off us who work for a living.  They will not have cars either coz they cant afford it, due to not working. Cant u tell I like chavs? Ha.|`|e22d86889cb88baa6ecf401b1f6a584caa	I wouldn't have moved...|`|jShfNvQXaa	Yep & when they aren't at the bus they are often just hanging around the bus stop! xx|`|piDDZ6Ywaa	Yes, they do. And half of them are so rude. I wouldn't make a scene of it at all, so that's good. Sometimes, when l see teenagers with babies, it makes me feel so sorry for them to be honest.|`|646fe42a895447edfec28e3ca8106fa2aa	Yes they do.  It's a shame they had to ask you to move and you couldn't have done it yourself . . .|`|7i6qj4OXaa	I see it every day where I live.  Those poor children; it really upsets me.|`|AA11391936	yes|`|BT5PqbJWaa	yea, it's a way of life for them.

Run it in your comp. Done...  Then go to torrent downloading site for eg. www.mininova.com  You search in Movies section that is available in that first page.    Search for movies.  See that there are some terms like seeds and peers.  Seeds are giving data to your comp and peers are taking data from your comp.  You dont worry about that, they dont give any trouble.    Before downloading see that no. of seeds are little greater than that of peers.    Click tha title of movie.  Click Download.  save that torrent in your desktop.      Now go to Desktop, right click the torrent you just downloaded, open with u torrent, Then give download.      It will download at same time.    Ok  I think my explnation is much enough.|`|NYBMFDlraa	yes|`|OY5kfYXCaa	Hey Ajay,                 You can download this movie from this website,  http://download-unborn-movie.wetpaint.co...

kNiWIilfaa	You have the rite to not speak in court.|`|R7VjuCT2aa	It protects suspects from forced self-incrimination. When a suspect invokes his or her Fifth Amendment right to remain silent, this is referred to in the vernacular as "pleading the Fifth." It should not by any means be taken as a sign of guilt, but it is generally portrayed as such in courtroom television dramas...
4hEbaIMOaa	yeah, i think so. the latest question is from 30 minutes ago.|`|j6RbKNmjaa	it is frozen...|`|wmBK9uASaa	It looks that way, just a glitch it happens from time to time....|`|bznQW3QYaa	Yea i was wondering the same  no one is asking question  glad i not the only one xD|`|63dUOWFNaa	Yes, it is frozen...
5ELpGvMKaa	Yes it is cute. Feels so special by the nickname.|`|OKClYfDQaa	That's a matter of personal preference.|`|OJtFNjfvaa	Yep =)|`|vdM9AJDtaa	ITS WHAT WE DO ... MY BF IS CALLED PORKPIE AND HE CALLS ME MOOMOO... AND ONLY WE KNOW WHY :-)|`|qhU3PDgfaa	ohh yes!.. it is very cute!.. lol|`|Puf6XhYaaa	not neccesarily, what if you called them fatty?|`|hlGXhHg3aa	Yea unless you call them Fidel Castro or Bumpy Stufflekins or something|`|Qlyh3pG0aa	Yep. Making eachother feel like their own, with whatever nickname you came up with for them, and having people around you thinkn why they call u dat name.|`|A60fh6craa	yes it is|`|dU5RD79Paa	Ya it is cute, only that you should keep in mind not to call names which hurt the person or make him angry.|`|e22d86889cb88baa6ecf401b1f6a584caa	Sure|`|6cpx0eZOaa	yes!|`|9h29IH22aa	According to me yes|`|Wi0LBsVbaa	I personally hate it. Any name tends to be a limiting label, as if you were that and nothing else.   It is more romantic and a part of "courtly love" to refrain from this behavior, so that the name of the beloved becomes perfumed with the attributes you would otherwise ascribe via nicknames.  I am not saying its good or bad, but it would be a relationship ender for me if carried far enough, but that's just me.|`|nsBxgXI1aa	yes i think it is|`|7OLayxXdaa	Sure as long as they like the nicknames|`|IiB6nXn5aa	Yes it's cute...signed "The Giant Redwood"|`|meqED8O9aa	In my opinion, it is just something special shared between the couple. Something that only the two of them can relate to.|`|996395421d166d021ac24276056cd66baa	i think it does  i'm termite  she's jellybean

Hitting myself doesn't seem to work.|`|4191bf22931e9cc7e405f80b732d50fbaa	splashes of ice water to the face, tooth picks to the lids, and working on the computer.....:)|`|FEdixswzaa	I slap myself repeatedly just for the heck of it. To stay awake, I make sure I get plenty of sleep beforehand.|`|AA10409668	Yeah, but all it did was hurt my face.  When I can't stay awake (at work or driving), I eat sunflower seeds.

Splashing cold water on my face.  I haven't tried slapping.  I don't think it would help me.|`|alYomnsvaa	I might have used this method once or twice.    Usually I just crank up the car radio!

kktoXldiaa	I can sing it well,I just can hold some of the notes as long as she can without having to stop and take a breath. No one can really sing it like how hayley sings it because no one can sing like her. You should sing it with your own voice level or else your going to end up damaging your voice. Try singing the song at your own pace. Make it into your own,it's ok if you dont sing certain parts the way she does in the song. good Luck!

I thought it was all medicinal...  And by a doctor?  Well, I do know this guy in Jamaica known as Dr. Dread.... Does that count?|`|AA11082713	I'm all for it!  I smoke it regularly anyways but have given it to family members who have been in agony because of cancer or whatnot and it's the best thing that got them through they say.I find it quite sad that so many people just can't see after all these centuries just how natural and healing it can be...xxx|`|rzZXJz0qaa	I think its fine ! =) I say legalize it|`|AA10409668	I think there are other drugs doctors can prescribe, but that's me.  ----------    I never smoked marijuana for medical reaons.|`|Mcr4IS6Vaa	Did you know that marijuana was originally developed as a medicine to cure for HIV and influenza?

She has told me that I will never need braces in my entire life, as they are naturally straight. Also, it is a strange fact that I lost my first tooth the day before my 4th birthday which is unusual to how most people lose it when they are 6.|`|lILfQh6xaa	only when i was a kid. It was a baby tooth so the damage wasnt long lasted.|`|nnOVIOV9aa	Yes.  Not fun.  I cracked the root when I bit down on something hard...and the nerve got infected...in New Hampshire on a weekend.  No dentist.  I had to suffer until I got back home the following Monday.  It killed the tooth, but that may have been a good thing.  The root canal was painless on a dead tooth.  The weekend was not much fun however.  Swollen cheek and severe pain.  All I had was excedrin.  Didn't work too well.|`|AA11178767	Yes I have in a car accident back in '89...|`|lGSUToFQaa	yes and it hurts and is so annoying,|`|AA10409668	Yeah, when I was a kid.

XhRLCFz8aa	What you need to do is bring him around your family. I don't think you can really love someone until your family loves (figuratively) that person with you, or at least approves of that person. Family is such a big part of life. Invite him to dinner a few times, and I bet if you like him so much, your mom will fall in suit soon enough.

On the flip side frigidity in a woman is also very unattractive .|`|OJtFNjfvaa	About 20%|`|XCpuUalOaa	No, I don't think so.

Some man may like that. Some man like virgins.    Promiscuity is generally frowned upon in woman (but may be encouraged in a man) (i.e. calling a woman slut and calling a man a pimp (though he could be called a player too)).|`|cusngBDQaa	yes, it would be charming to see a girl with a vagina hole so wide cos she's done it with so many men    course not =____________=|`|hlGXhHg3aa	haha maybe if you don't have moral values pertaining to such activities|`|85a7adb7410df3ce980f02b34377f6edaa	No, FANNY, its not. its sickening|`|s5PIU01oaa	Nope! but a  nebulous person does believe in it!|`|XOtN0mzNaa	Nope.|`|w6xct1qQaa	Depends on how physically attractive she is.....not gonna go for an ugly bike!|`|NT08sMBpaa	Well i do like a woman who knows what shes doing so who am i to judge!|`|PuPQF8QIaa	Most guys I know would say no.

If males are looking for commitment in a woman, they may feel put off by her history of one-night stands.    If however they're just looking for a fling, they probably won't give a damn.    As I said, personal opinion.|`|JD5NQxeNaa	All I got to say is that I as a male feel it is totally biased and unfair that society admires us men for an abundance of bedfellows. While, females are looked down upon for promiscuity. I think it is kind of hot for a woman to have that sort of experience, I would not like her sleeping around if she was w/ me though as she can probably relate in my case too.

I was tired of the same old horror movies, thought I'd try something different.  I picked this movie up at a used rack.  It's called Dead birds.      The movie was creepy, eerie, and gave me chills, bad heart palps, and I couldn't sleep for hours after watching.      i recommend dead birds.

The Deer Hunter.  It's not really a horror movie but it had an impact on me for weeks.|`|XsmPnMU4aa	The Final Destination trilogy.

ab1c9b81d36c3691f0d575d773009489aa	You could be desensitized...I am.  I love horror movies, they amuse me, but they don't scare me. "Pet Semetary" creeps me out a bit though.|`|x6rHjPIIaa	My favorite is Resident Evil (I've only seen the first one)   I recommend REPO! The Genetic Opera. It is really really really awesome!!  It's not really that scary (atleast not to me..everyone else I know is completely freaked out by it lol)   It definitely has a story line. But some of it is kind of confusing-- they had to take out alot because they didn't have enough money to put it all in.  But you should see it.  :)    also anythig directed by tim burton is great but not all of his movies are scary.|`|I2Gsu4tMaa	Is that you? Your hair is gorgeous.    On topic.

Also, The Grudge(Japanese Version--they have English subtitles) and The Eye(Also the Japanese Version).      Oh, and Amityville Horror is pretty scary too.|`|zozNBHcJaa	I would suggest any of the Hellraiser movies (not too scary, but pretty good story), Silence of the Lambs (not scary either, but Hannibal Lecter is one of the coolest characters i've ever seen), and if you wanna laugh your *** off at how horrible it is, find the movie "Chopping Mall." It was a horrible horror flick but funny at the same time.    If you're looking for a real screamer, go with Halloween (except for the 3rd one and the remake).

7B2s7maWaa	I really didn't care for it.  Which is strange I am usually a big fan of Will Smith, but this movie was just so stupid.  I wanted to laugh, but I could not find one thing remotely funny about this film.  All I can say is I am very happy I waited for the DVD and did not go and spend money to see it at the theaters.  I may sound like I am being harsh right now, but it is true. I did not care for this movie at all.   I know some people either say it was so funny and cute then others like me are like eh no thanks. The tornado scene was kick ***. I can give them that, otherwise imo it was not very good.|`|XsmPnMU4aa	I never saw it but I have heard others like it.

However I have watched it a second time and it was better...probably because I already had knowledge of what it was. I still think the concept of the movie was good, just implemented badly.

8b4b7257f99aa7453844e30ba950e978aa	That's actually pretty clever. I assume you have more to the plot than that you just go around killing zombies all day (make mini-missions in there too... "zombie's kidnap your friend, you rescue another surviver, etc.")     The physics geek in me can't get over the fact that you just miraculously survive a nuclear bomb (were you just randomly in a six foot thick lead room? haha), but other than that, it sounds like a pretty cool game. I can think of at least three of my friends along with myself off the top of my head that would play it.    Choosing the city in place of difficulty level is clever. I never would have thought of that. :)    Good luck.

Once again the clerk charges them $30, or $15 per person. After the clerk remembers the total rate is only $25 he sends the bellhop upstairs with five $1 bills to pay the two friends back. The bellhop knows he got away with larceny once so he tries it again. But this time he pockets $3 and returns $2 to the hotel guests ($1 per guest). So each of the two guests got $1 back from their original $15. Therefore each paid $14 which is a total payment of $28 for the room. Now the bellhop has $3, the guests paid $28, for a total of $31....THERE'S THE MISSING DOLLAR!!!!|`|AA11821565	it fell on the floor|`|cde262aa36fcbd52c431cd2e2cf41107aa	the bell boy stole a dollar

One option is to write about something you really enjoy, like a sport, or a hobby, and how you got started with it. Another is you could write a story, and it would be easier if it was something that happened to you. You can take something funny or interesting that happened to you, like if you had an adventure at a theme park or when you went somewhere with your friends, or you can take something that appears to be ordinary and spice it up and make it fun! For example, you could take a time you went on vacation with your family and turn it into something funny, or adventerous. Since this is open, and I can see that you like Harry Potter, maybe you could write fanfiction? Those are always fun. Let your imagination run! Good luck with your paper! If you have any questions on the construction and the writing of the paper, feel free to email me. =)

AA11315187	First off, boredom is more or less an affect based upon ones own individuality. Those who can easily entertain themselves, not to offend your intelligence in anyway, are the ones with curious and inquisitive minds. Therefore, you should find something to read or a new Television program to watch. I am suffering from the same horrid disorder, if indeed boredom is a disorder.

kQXD91Wdaa	find someone who can listen to you and help you e.g a voice coach or singing teacher. what you hear when you sing might not sound the same to someone listening. A good teacher will be able to pick up on your range, tone, projection, technique and will be able to give you tips on how to improve it all therefore making you a good singer. If you want to go it alone to improve your quality a very important factor you need to remember is that you need to breathe from your diaphragm you will hear this from everyone who is a singer this is because when you sing the sound comes from air brushing your vocal chords if you sing from your throat you will damage your voice! another point to think about is open your mouth sounds really simple but if you do not articulate and say your words properly one your audience may not be able to understand you and 2 it is harder to reach notes and project. If you sing a lot you should look after your voice well buy these sweet called vocal zones which can be found in chemists and drink honey and lemon! As someone else has said dairy products are not good for your voice because it clogs up your vocal chords. If you have a cold you should not sing for 48hours even if it has cleared up. Hope this helps|`|YYOiYUDtaa	Do some voice harmonies and start with a higher key and as you go along make it sound lower. This helps a lot, I started off singing like this with no professional help and now I'm a semi professional singer. Also don't strain your voice too much when not singing this damages the vocal chord. And talk less, sounds stupid but it's true.|`|ceF5X2m7aa	all about practice..  do it all the time!|`|6f7DFIZYaa	I have found that not having too much dairy foods does make a difference - my throat gets clearer,also when I have been inspired - by things being sorted out and when life kind of flows then my voice just seems to sound better - (mental/emotional clarity) and I have also tried a self massage on my throat area with a nice massage oil done with love and I did notice my voice flowed better!|`|H2Cdy9Foaa	Practice and practice..

Any guess at how old the teacher is?    Look behind your seat in class, is there someone else or is the teacher just looking out the window at the birds flying by?    If you can change seats, how about sitting closer to the front and see if he looks that direction, or keeps staring out the window.    Move over to the other side of the classroom, and see if he notices.      What class is it?    Good Luck!|`|RoBmEehMaa	ask him politely to stop|`|aIOJG6qPaa	hes a perv, my teacher stares at every girl too    he tries to get me into class after school when im getting a B+ - he says I need more help in that class...    what a fruit....right?|`|yU6T1q0taa	Ask him, preferably in front of everybody else.|`|6DtFiA45aa	Just say: : "Look buddy, I don't feel that Comfortable with you looking at me all the time.

UxdjYFJaaa	He's a d*****bag. Totally uncalled for.    I guess he thinks just because the guy isn't anybody important with a seven figure salary he can blow up at them.    Who cares if the guy did something stupid (if he even did) - he still deserves respect.|`|yxoXTmlqaa	He sucked in Batman.  He sucked in the sequel.  He sucked in all his other movies.  He sucks.  So why shouldn't his attitude be a giant sucking black hole.   (non-sexual)  (wait)  (take it as you want)|`|56dfvnwmaa	yeah. it was kinda funny actually.    I'll admit it was messed up to blow up in the guy's face like that. but at least unlike fits from other people who are diva's this one was actually relating to the movie. it was caused more from his passion towards acting than his status as a celebrity. so I'll cut him some slack for that reason.    but yeah pretty messed up though|`|ZZJKTV8laa	hahaha yes! i was in the bathroom and could hear that clip on tv all the way at the other end of the house hahah he needs to just quit hes making a fool of himself.|`|db4b4aa8deeae52ad9947eec755b5f73aa	I tend to agree with "I didn't do it"  The guy was working got stressed out, and flipped out. For a while now people have know that he tends to get angry and were waiting for the right moment to get under his skin again.    At least he wasn't ranting about shoes or some dum stuff like that.    Oh and I also find it disrespectful when people say; "oh what's he so worked about, its not shakespear !"    That's not fair to anybody. Everyone's job should feel important to them. If actors did not care about their jobs then  their movies would all suck (some movies do suck). At least it is apparent that mr. Bale takes his job seriously.

But you know he is married to Ashlee Simpson right? and they have a baby.|`|1jlEwpu3aa	no, hes married to a girl. he is bi though.|`|AA10453678	one can only hope and he does wear eyeliner you know|`|iz8hh0vNaa	No, Pete Wentz is not gay.  He is currently married to Ashlee Simpson, and they have a son.  If he was gay or bisexual, I'm sure it'd be all over the tabloid news by now.|`|73c08aa590c890d1f54b22d1db2cef60aa	He's bi-sexual. He's admitted to being with guys before.|`|Xtqs0Hxzaa	He is not gay. He's bi.
fzqMOD4Waa	Well. It depends on wether you enjoy Floyd for the musicality or the concepts.    Gilmour is the musicial genius in Floyd (he even played bass on most albums instead of Waters.)    Whilst Waters is more the man behind the conceptuality of Floyd ( stories, idealism, big and grand stage shows etc.)    Case in point: After Waters went on his big hissyfit and left, Gilmour based Floyd came up with "A Momentary Lapse of Reason." Whilst around the same time Roger worked on Radio KAOS.    Now, owning both albums, they do have their merits. But "Momentary..." lacks the conceptuality of a good Floyd album, whilst KAOS, holds more merit in the concept group, but is harder to listen to in a musical sense.    I personally prefer the music compared to the concept, so I must say David.|`|XhJuHMwQaa	Waters.  That's when Pink Floyd was at their best.|`|yRE2HDr3aa	Roger Waters for his lyrics and song writing.|`|ZNh9Rr8faa	I love alllllllll of Pink Floyd....but I'd say David Gilmour...just because he is the singer, as opposed to bass player...that's the only reason|`|ecL0ZbfCaa	I love them both but Pink Floyd under Gilmours leadership was 'dull as dishwater', so my vote goes to Roger Waters|`|qh9Pa1tVaa	It's not fair to compare. Roger and David also with Nick and Rich (R.I.P) and Syd (R.I.P), make Pink Floyd a Progressive rock band monster!    I love all of them!|`|g3UZXbYdaa	i prefer david!  but roger is amazing too.

7iC8Fz3Naa	Hi Lejarn,    Your girlfriend sounds very talented. Theres actually a few ways she could get discovered for her talents. I'm sure, you've heard many of them before, send out demos to producers, find an agent etc etc. But one new way is to post some samples of her singing on talent websites. Theres a few of them popping up here and there but some of them have talent scouts on them who can put your girlfriend on the inside track. Good luck.

But, somehow I always had something else to   take care of first, the truck, hunting, always something more important   to me.     Finally she thought of a clever way to make her point. When I   arrived home one day, I found her seated in the tall grass, busily   snipping away with a tiny pair of sewing scissors. I watched silently for   a short time and then went into the house.     I was gone only a few minutes. When I came out again I handed her a   toothbrush. "When you finish cutting the grass," I said, "you might as   well sweep the sidewalk."

Upstairs there are three bedrooms and the bathroom, and further up is the attic which got divided up into another bedroom and some storage room.  The cellar is only half the length of the house, because the other half is the upstairs of the house below us. (This is where it gets hard to explain.)

AA10098101	Don't worry about it.  What you hear will lie to you.  Memorex doesn't lie.     Instead focus on how singing feels.  Do you feel like you are using your full voice?
AA10292870	Have you done the pencil exercise? The pencil exercise is when you take a pencil ,before you start playing ,and place one end in the center of your lips and squeeze for a few seconds and then begin your long tones on the horn. For a visual check the website warrenvache.com I include a link for a how to I uploaded.|`|MoKUZuQraa	Do not let yourself get frustrated. I know it can seem very frustrating at first to learn an instrument especially like you said. You have many ideas for improv, but it's hard to get them out if you can't play the trumpet well.     Here's what I would suggest don't kill yourself or try to play the hard stuff right away. Don't even see how big your range is yet. Just work on the embouchure ny playing what are called long tones. This will get your face muscles used to how they're supposed to feel on the trumpet. A long tone is you just hold a note out for as long as possible with a steady pitch. So start on notes that are easy for you to hit and hold. After doing this slowly but surely your air support and chops will improve greatly and you will have a much higher range as your embouchure will have gotten better with your air support. Learning an instrument takes time. Patience is key. Also, another good idea might be to ask a friend or someone you know who plays trumpet for some help or pointers.    As far as how long it will take to hit Gs and Cs it's different for every person. Depends how much you want to hit it and if you won't just give up on it after a week or so.    I hope this helps and good luck!|`|d3G5XZkAaa	The muscles in your embouchure are the same as any other muscle in your body as far as developing them. Just like with weight lifting you want to take short breaks in between heavy practice exercises, otherwise you will find that you have an extremely tight feeling all the time. You don't want that, so it is important to pause in between exercises. Also after every practice session you should warm down by playing long tones bellow the staff or even pedal tones. I recommend the Jimmy Stamp warm up exercise book.   Also, you should know that building muscle takes time, don't rush it and beat yourself up otherwise you will end up with a tight embouchure or an embouchure that is off balance somehow.  To build range and endurance I recomment doing lip slurs.  I have been playing for 11 years and right before entering college went through an embouchure change where I basically had to learn how to play all over again. It is very frustrating, but you have to be patient.  Goodluck

7GHkeHZpaa	FinalCut, Pinnacle and Adobe Premiere are the top video editing programs...     maybe download a trial of them to see which you like best before you invest in it.|`|41HUXSwgaa	Most people opt with Windows Movie Maker, but the best software I would reccommend is Sony Vegas Pro 8, which supports most audio and video formats.    It's also easy to use with a drag-and-drop function. So if you want to add a clip or some sound just drag it into one of the tracks on Sony Vegas.

Being skilled at adapting is a valuable asset to have and will serve you well in the future.

If you pull forwards anything that's attached to the nail will just rip through the nail but the nail will most likely stay attached. So if you could somehow get ahold of the nail from an upper angle the nail will unattach itself more. Also, banging your foot against a wall will eventually cause the nail to come off.    But, seriously, I am feeling a little sick even thinking about toe nails being ripped off. If you are serious about wanting it off, get a doctor to take it off or fix it. Goodluck :)|`|EWms0Hqhaa	um, i didn't need that visual. yuck.    just pull?

BKrqlGz4aa	Well at least the other to answer this question didn't just say "They Sucked" and not tell why they thought that they sucked although some of his complaints, like Yoda in a lightsabre duel, were at the other end of the spectrum for me.      As an "old school" fan from the 70s I will be the first to admit that the prequels were lacking something that the OT had.  Since I run a SW fan site I've actually sat down and tried to figure out some of those reasons why it was lacking.  The biggest reason was Lucas himself ... when he decided to do the prequels he actually gave himself an impossible job ... make three movies as good or better than the OT ... it just couldn't be done.  I agree with the other answer about Lucas falling in love with all the new CGI stuff that he could do and forgot that the one thing that made the OT the iconic saga that it will always be was the story ... not the cool way thing blow up.  He returned to that somewhat with ep III.  Fan expectations were another big one.  With all the time that passed between the two trilogies fans had already "Fleshed" the story of the Clone Wars and Anakin's fall to the dark side to become Vader in our heads ... when the movies came out and it didn't match what we had in our own heads it ticked us off.  Highly ironic that the fans are the ones that made the OT what it was and that our own expectations were one of the reasons that we didn't like the prequels.    There's a ton of other reasons but these are some of them.  In retrospect, for myself anyways, I've come to see the prequels as decent, not in the same league of the OT but close.    May The Force Be With You ...|`|wB5dk84Jaa	jar jar binks ruined everything  seriously though a lot of people felt lucas lost touch with the franchise somehow.  i heard a lot of complaints about the the acting of the kid who played a young darth vader.    personally i think lucas fell in love in with cgi and overused it with lame cgi characters like jar jar binks and general who fought with 3 or 4 lightsabers at one time.  having yoda fight lightsaber battles and jump around like sonic the hedgehog looked cartoonish and was stupid.  the best characters in the franchise have always been played by real people.  darth maul and jango fett were both underused and it was a big mistake to kill off maul so early.  fight scenes with both characters were easily the best parts of the second trilogy, even better than the climatic darth vader fight scene.

It made me want to be an assassin and learn to curve a bullet. I saw that one twice in the theaters! It had action and humor but no sappy romance, which makes for almost a perfect movie!    Also, "WALL-E" was good because it had such breathtaking animation.    My favorite independent films were "The Fall," in which a stuntman in early Hollywood tells a fellow hospital patient an elaborate fairy tale, and "Slumdog Millionaire." I saw that before Thanksgiving, way before the hype started, and I thought it was one of the better movies that came out this year.

4I9uiWjmaa	The elevator scene where Hoffman first meets Jigsaw was a flashback. In the timeline it is set before the plot of Saw 1.    It reveals, how Hoffman becomes Kramer's student.  Jigsaw, getting weaker because of his disease, was looking for some assistants. So he gave Hoffman the choice whether to destroy his career at FBI, or to start a second "career" and become a member of the Saw-team.    So, in the elevator scene Kramer was still alive, but already terminally ill.

TpG59Lpjaa	Nice choice btw. I've got an Epiphone SG G400 Worn Brown, they're excellent.    1. In Australia they're about $400 which, I believe, is about 180 pounds - if you shop around on ebay then compare it to the price in stores it should give you a good idea.    2. I've never seen a modern left-handed Epiphone in Australia, but they might exist in Britain or America, I'm not sure.    3. Yes, that would be awesome! The bridge pickup on the SG is really trebly and it would be awesome for rock/punk/country plus the neck pickup is nice and warm.    Hope his helps :)

There was a 2pac song called "Mama's just a little girl"  Part of the hook or the chorus of the song was "we are the roses".    "Kiss from a Rose" by Seal was popular around then, but isn't a rap song.

tuATxHsVaa	What?? You most CERTAINLY can adjust this problem on an acoustic guitar. Just because electric guitars are slightly different doesn't mean it's impossible on an acoustic, lol.     All you are doing (when you do this) is changing the length of the string. Most acoustic guitars have something near the bridge called a "saddle" which you can move around to adjust this intonation problem quite easily. That's your first line of business. A lot of electric guitars have an almost identical thing. It should have the same name, too. I don't understand why someone would say it's "impossible" on an acoustic. Makes no sense to me.    In fact, I have a video here explaining the basics on how it works.    http://www.expertvillage.com/video/11792...    If the saddles don't do it and the other tricks you read about don't work, then there is still hope.    Try different strings and if that doesn't work see how much your local repair shop will charge you to do this work for you. Talk to them about strings, show them the instrument. Ask them for advice on how to correct this minor problem quickly and painlessly (because you already know it's an easy fix, and because you will not buy strings there if they jack you around).    Definitely ignore the people who are telling you that your frets are wrong. That's silly. How hard is it to use a ruler and measure something? Not very.    Next time you buy an acoustic figure out what kind of strings it currently has and whether or not it is playable. Keep using similar strings and talk to a professional if you decide to make drastic changes to the tension, etc.    Hope this helps you with your specific needs.    When you locate the saddles and mess with them a bit, that should do the trick. THEN START PLAYING!! weeeee.    =)|`|7h91Cc4raa	Well these answers are wrong. Its your guitars intonation meaning the harmonic pitch isnt correct against the real tone.  Its pretty easy to fix all you need is a screw driver and time.  I re intonate my guitar every week just to make sure its all good.  It has nothing to do with the frets either so ignore that answer. Neither has it got anything to do with how much the guitar cost.  In accoustic guitars however the solution is much different.  As you cant re- intonate them.  The solution is different strings as all makes have different wraps on them meaning some are tighter than others. So experiment with different strings then check the harmonics. If that does not work then it means your bridge on your guitar has been placed wrong.|`|TpG59Lpjaa	If you try a different gauge of strings it could fix it, it worked with one of mine. Although, if it's a classical guitar, their strings are usually only avaliable in one gauge.|`|1SnI86BIaa	tune your guitar using harmonics    put your finger on the 12 fret, put dont push the string down, just hold it theyre gently, then pluck/strum the string, itll make a light sound, but the tuner should be able to pick it up|`|obGQ2Bqfaa	no instrument can be perfectly tuned..because of the discrepancy called the Comma of Pythagoras...Sorry guys it's a Maths thing !      basically a multiple of one interval doesn't quite equal a multiple of another|`|ceF5X2m7aa	ehh i think its normal..  just a little higher thou..|`|2soyTz7eaa	This is normal. Guitars all can sound slightly different. Thats why smoe acoustic guitars cost 200 while some cost 1200. Dont worry, be happy.|`|c4dfd045cf26cc01fe2ca78027e0bfdfaa	It means your frets are measured wrong. And no, there isn't a way to fix it that would be realistic. you can have it re-fretted but taking into account the trouble and cost, you might as well buy a new (better) one.

vpoP8ksHaa	I Don't Care by Fall Out Boy.  I don't like it but its modern and easy.    Most AC/DC songs. TNT, Dirty Deeds, Back In Black (first song i ever learnt), etc.    Dammit by Blink 182.    learn chords, look up some chords for songs and just strum along. thats always easy, but sounds nice :)|`|DcCECelaaa	The song "Venus" is just a few chords back and forth and one you can get into by strumming with lots of easy rhythm.  It helps if you can sing along as people will recognize this tune, originally by Shocking Blue, then updated by Bananarama.  While this is more of an "Oldie" now, it still grooves...it still rocks...and your audience will recognize it and get into it.     Check it out on the You Tube video:    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2DBcbZc3...    When I play this on acoustic guitar, on the back beat right before the chord change, I make a palm slap to the face of the guitar which adds rhythm and makes the piece more interesting to viewers.  Ir'a mosty a back and forth chord pattern, from 1 to 4 to 1 to 4.  So the slap goes 1-1-SLAP-1-4-4-SLAP-4-1-1-SLAP-1-4-4-SLA... one finger across all 6 strings for the strumming portion (listen to the song and you'll get it as I can't write guitar music here on Y!A).

There could be many answers! I mean, why do you cross the road? See what I mean here? We don't know how, when, where, or what the chicken's name was. There are endless possibilities! Also, why is it a chicken? Said animal could have been a squirrel, hedgehog, platypus, anything! Maybe the chicken was going somewhere, or maybe the chicken just wanted to sit on the nice warm pavement. This is a very vague question. What road? What town? What chicken? It's almost like saying, Why do you cross the road? Well, I know I cross many roads for many different reasons! Why should the chicken be any different? There is not one answer, but endless possibilities! We need to understand these important variables. Of course, different circumstances will mean that this chicken in particular will cross a road for countless reasons.Why did the human cross the road? Why DID you cross the road? Whatever your answer may be, it is also a valid answer for our question here. I believe it would be very hard to experiment with this interesting question, because if you plop a chicken down next to a road, it could cross at any given time! You would need a camera. And if you chased the chicken across the road, and it ran away from you, there's your answer right there: to get away from you! The chicken would need to cross the road on its own. I think actually, there are no wrong answers to this question, and obviously there is no definite correct answer. Why did the human drive his car? You can think of many different answers for that, now can't you? (I had to run to K-Mart...It was my Aunt's birthday etc...)

hJP9y6kjaa	If you feel that music should be separate and apart from concerns about making money, then you're an idealist, and you'll see someone who is commercially successful as suspect, and will be biased towards the opinion that they make their music to make money instead of making music as an expression of their intellect, emotions, soul, whatever.    If you think that music isn't too sacred to be a product that can be hustled and sold (so to speak) then you're a bit more of a pragmatist, and the term won't mean much to you. After all, you need money to live, and the term "starving artist" isn't just a stereotype.    You can't disassociate music from money in the world we live in. You simply can't. What people expect, though, is a degree of consistency.    If you're the guy who sells songs to Britney Spears, then people aren't going to label you as a "sell-out". That's your job - you write music for pop tarts. That, and many of these people are reeeaaally good at their job - if I start singing "Hit me Baby One More Time" how hard will it be for you to get it out of your head? (that, and the music video? mmm, and that catholic school-girl shimmy...)    What if you're an artist who has always proclaimed that you're out there doing it just for the music, that the music is the most important thing in your life... but you change your style, you change your music once you sign a record deal and get some money.... well, that means you lied then, doesn't it?     Of course, it's not that simple. As an artist changes, so will their music. I mean, you give me a million dollars and I guarantee you that my life will change - and so will the music I write! (I might write a lot less pissed off songs! *grin*)    And that's the thing that sucks. Money changes things, and when you have something that is as meaningful and sacred to people as music, seeing it change can be heart-breaking.    The fact of the matter is that change is inevitable, though, so stop dreaming about all of the Metallica albums that should've sounded like the first four... it won't happen, it wouldn't've happened, the artists changed too much over time.    You can also take the perspective of Maynard from Tool....     "All you know about me is what Ive sold you...   I sold out long before you ever heard my name"    There is always compromise in music, and that's one of the hardest things for people to accept. Even in artists who are very independent and pursue their own path and all of that crap, a balance must be maintained, even if it's entirely internal. No musician is an island, so to speak.    I don't know if that makes sense to anyone else... as an artist, though, I know that if you only truly make music for yourself that your audience will only be one person - you. The reason that people get up on a stage and play for other people isn't to play their music for themselves... think about it! To appeal to other people, to get your message across, there is always a dynamic between the performer and the audience.    I could throw in an obscure reference to game theory, but I'm kinda hoping that my point has been made.    People change, people evolve, and sometimes people just say "I used to believe that music was more important than health care benefits for my family".    It's the real world, and while we may praise the artists who can live on the edge and cling to their artistic ideals, the sad truth is that only those who don't need to worry about a paycheck or those who have nothing to lose can do so.      Saul|`|71SjVwWNaa	its the band members job to make a living off their music...i don't think any of them sell out b/c if anyone of us were in their shoes we would do the same thing to get more money...its like your boss asking if you want a raise and you saying no...no one in this day and age is not going to take the money just so they can say "i didn't sell out"|`|4bc3ee931fca2067bef8aafb614f2089aa	It usually is just the band evolving, which by most is still considered selling out (bands are not allowed to change their sound), but sometimes it's obvious when a band is changing their sound to make money.|`|m3ThrbDMaa	I think the "sell-out" accusation has always been ridiculous, because...    Bands are NOT (as much as we want them to be) public servants whose job it is to look after our best interests by being "role models" or "heroes"  to the segments of the population their music appeals to...    (In other words...if your music principles are so lofty that you lose millions of dollars in income because you won't sign a contract with Wal Mart, if you aren't rich already, do yourself a favor and lower those music principles a touch, and make some serious money "first," and then you can afford to have lofty principles much later...being a starving musician is not as much fun as being a rich one...)    They are first and foremost...    "Music Entertainers Trying To Make A Successful Living at Performing Music," and no musician in this world would be telling you the truth if they told you that they never had "money" or "fame" in mind when they started playing...they may "consciously" believe that malarkey, but deep down under, those "it's all about the music" dudes forget that if the music is good enough...    You're going to be rich and famous...no doubt...|`|Csx3ZXlmaa	It depends. I will use bands like Pearl Jam and Red Hot Chili Peppers as examples. They have definitely evolved, especially the Chili's, as it would be nearly impossible to see Anthony Kiedis rapping about sex now lol.    However, they are accused of 'selling out' because they, 9 times out of 10, sell WAY more records. This isn't the case with Pearl Jam, which is why they were never branded as sell-outs, but they have instead been branded as 'going stale'.    As for the Chilis, because they are now one of the biggest bands in the world since releasing Californication, they are branded as 'sell-outs'.     In my opinion, 'selling-out' is when you use your music to get more money, and deliberately change your sound to make more money. Neither Pearl Jam or RHCP have done this, in my opinion, as their original influences still show through in their music.    Overall, most bands progress and evolve their music. There are some bands, like Nickelback who have blatantly sold out (Rockstar in DFS adverts!), and who rip off other bands to make more money (Nickelback, Oasis). And unfortunately...it works...|`|AA10098101	Sometimes its one, sometimes its the other.    Some bands do sell out, some were really sold out from their beginnings.  Other bands do just change their music style and get accused of selling out by their fans that may not like their new style.      I think that you can usually tell if you're a true fan of a band; you get to know their heart and inspiration.  A true sell out only changes for the sake of making a buck, but true musicians are constantly learning new things, and they adapt how they play to include their new knowledge and it may sound a bit different; but if they are true musicians, their heart and inspiration will still be the same.|`|8TZD3PUTaa	I honestly think that it depends.  I think a band sells out when they are making music that doesn't come from their hearts to get a bigger paycheck.  Changing your sound doesn't necessarily mean you're selling out unless you're doing it for the wrong reasons.|`|U9KJNuq6aa	i think usually they just evolve. i don't know why so many bands are accused of "selling out" for trying something new. who decided that a band is only supposed to stick to a certain sound our they are "selling out" anyway?    unless they're just putting out a **** album to make some money.|`|vpoP8ksHaa	hmm.    well Angus Young from AC/DC said, at the start of their career they didn't really care about what they played, and it was more pop than rock n roll because all they wanted was to get recognised. they didnt care what they played as long as people liked them. soon after they began to stick to hard rock n roll, and have stuck by it since.    i think this could be the reason for other bands changing their sound too. i think mostly it is selling out. they might be really good for a while, but when their sound is no longer desired, they're so driven by being liked by people that they just play what ever will get people to listen to them again.    that's my view.|`|t2evcVVEaa	Selling out" refers to the compromising of one's integrity, morality and principles in exchange for money, 'success' (however defined) or other personal gain. It is commonly associated with attempts to increase mass appeal or acceptability to mainstream society. A person who does this, as opposed to continuing along his or her original path, is labelled a sellout and typically regarded with disgust and immediate loss of respect. Selling out is often seen as gaining success at the cost of credibility.    very very few bands "sell out" and i think its complete bull when people say bands like Metallica have sold out. i think you nailed it in the head here. the problem is is that its popular to hate a bands, group, or singers "new stuff". and thats bull. I dont care what anyone says but metallica's newest album is thier best ever. and since its so popular to hate on new stuff the fact that "...and justice for all" has so much novelty, fans hate to admit that metallica has topped themselves.  sorry, im just using metallica as a point of refference.  Also, many ignorant music fans will sit there and say a band has sold out, simple because they have found mainstream success... i would bet $$ that 95% of the people that claim a band has sold out cannot even give you a real definition of the word. thanks for beinging this to light. : )|`|VvUxR6qRaa	i think that alot of bands simply evolve, but i can also think of a few who have "sold out" in the true sense of the word.    the term "sell out" in relation to music gets thrown around so much, i think most people have lost the actual meaning of what it is.  I'm a massive metallica fan, and they certainly cop alot of flack (just an example, i know alot of other bands do as well).  surely they still love what they're doing, and it's music that they're happy to make and release.  as a fan, i'm stoked that they're still around, and i'm still able to go and see them perform.    i think about it like this, my taste in music has changed over the years, and will probably continue to do so, even if the changes are small.  so why can't they change what they release?    they have worked so hard, and if a change gains them more fans and more money, good on them!  i wish i had their talent!!    EDIT: Metallica4life, well said.  love the quote.|`|yS61H04haa	Some sell out , some just evolve. Classic cases of sell out would be Korn, Disturbed, Godsmack and Staind.|`|pcdrdQHMaa	This type of "selling out" is probably a progression. There becomes a point when a band becomes popular and finally gets paid. As they become more accepted and have financial stability, some bands gain the freedom and ability to explore new and different sounds. And some old fans call it selling out when they hear that new sound.|`|Lngb8ryFaa	no body really "sells out", thats ridiculous...the only way you can sell out id if you do a COMPLETE 180 from the music you were making JUST for $ or because a new style is popular..metallica never did that as so many idiots claim they have...    ..the only real case of "selling out" was when KISS made a disco album in the 70's (Dynasty) with the song "i was made for loving you"..they went from a straight up rock band to a disco band JUST because disco became big--thats selling out..|`|3FYopGiIaa	i think that ever since the metallica v.s. napster thing everyone assumes a band sells out because they conform to the new way music is played or get out of the "underground scene". People like that are'nt the true fans. The true fans would love the band because of the feeling behind the music more than the music itself or the way the members did something.  Plus record labels are evil to some people for the bands they love it really depends on who you talk to|`|TGOVVZ0zaa	It depends. If they are doing it to get more money then yeah ts selling out.  If the sound changes  because its coming from the heart then that is just evolving!|`|xwD8PUFlaa	It depends whether or not they or not they change their sound just 4 the money.    MOST bands evolve, but think about it, after making the same sound 4 say 10yrs or more u'd probably wanna experiment with something different.   'Selling out' is just wat people say when their pissed off a new album doesn't sound like the others.    But u have 2 respect that bands don't exist 4 the purpose of keeping u happy, its wat the BAND enjoys doing at that time.    This is a quote from the lead singer of my favourite band (who many people have accused of selling out) about the above statement.  "We do this basically for ourselves. People appreciate it, which is cool, but I think they appreciate that we're doing it for ourselves. We're doing it our way, and how people like it is not up to us. We like it." - James Hetfield.|`|zqOelChsaa	I think that some bands do evolve, as you suggest. However this is rare compared to the amount of bands that sell out.|`|U2t6Pndhaa	I do not think that progressing in your musical style means that you are a sell out.  I know a lot of people do, though.  I just had this conversation this weekend about Metallica and Korn.  I do not think that Korn was a "sell out" because they did an unplugged album, nor do I think they are a "sell out" because their most recent album sounds a little different than their first album.  Same thing with Metallica.  Band members grow and change.  If they only sounded the same all them time...why bother making more than one album?!

In the year 2001 I think, the ******* RIAA made downloading copyrighted songs illegal. Although, its illegal, people still use P2P applications to download music. The RIAA basically only targets the people who allow people to take your music and people who download 500+ songs a day. If you download a few a day then you should be fine. But you are still running the risk that the RIAA will subpoena* you. There are programs that can mask your IP address like GhostSurf and PeerGurdian that make it harder for the RIAA to search for you. Most people use LimeWire, a P2P program that runs on the GNUTELLA network. You can get free, legal music on the GNUTELLA network though. These are songs that are either very old and dont have a copyright liscense or songs produced by a band that doesnt have a record deal yet and uses P2P to distribute their songs and let people know about their music.    There are ways to get legal music but its not free. There are many pay services like Buy.com, Napster, Msn, Yahoo!, and the most popular, iTunes Music Store. Most of the time, a song is 99  cents. All of these songs are DRM-Protected, meaning the company ***** with the song and only allows you to burn or transfer the song to a mp3 player for a limited time. iTMS uses their proprietary format, AAC on thier songs. As of now, iPOd players are the only ones that can read that format.|`|AA11114970	Be carefull, you could get arrested answering a question like that.

J-Boog and his girlfriend had a baby not to long ago so right now hes at home taking care of his small family. He also has been appearing on some television sitcoms    Omarion is still doing the singing stuff, hes just doing it solo. He recently came out with a cd and hes currently on tour. A new cd should be releashed soon.    Lil'Fizz is doing his thing solo too. Hes in the studio preparing his cd. The cd is all of his raps along with some songs done with him and other people. Hes pretty tight too may I add. You can check his myspace out for some of his solo songs.    Raz B is also trying to do the solo thing. He is trying to come out with some songs, hes more of a singer, like Usher than a rapper. So far Ive havent heard of any songs made by him but most likely he will have some out late in the year. Hopefully!    **Omarion is the sexiest of all four of them too may I add**|`|644b90d873d4a88eaeb0ae8553363715aa	I'm sorry but I think the bigger question here is....:Who cares!?!?!?

Again, the old man said to stick it in his butt. the man did. The second man was almost finished but he laughed so hard that he died.

For example, the trade name of Tylenol also has a generic name of Acetaminophen. Aleve is also called Naproxen. Amoxil is also call Amoxicillin and Advil is also called Ibuprofen.    The FDA has been looking for a generic name for Viagra. After careful consideration by a team of government experts, it recently announced that it has settled on the generic name of Mycoxafloppin. Also considered were Mycoxafailin, Mydixadrupin, Mydixarizin, Dixafix, and of course, Ibepokin.    Pfizer Corp. announced today that Viagra will soon be available in liquid form, and will be marketed by Pepsi Cola as a power beverage suitable for use as a mixer. It will now be possible for a man to literally pour himself a stiff one. Obviously we can no longer call this a soft drink, and it gives new meaning to the names of "cocktails", "highballs" and just a good old-fashioned "stiff drink". Pepsi will market the new concoction by the name of: MOUNT & DO!|`|AA10542688	What do you call a man in a refugee camp with a dog?

The Pope says, "What can I do? "The Colonel says, "I need you to  change the daily prayer from, 'Give us this day our daily bread' to  'Give us this day our daily chicken'. If you do it, I'll donate 10  Million Dollars to the Vatican."  The Pope replies, "I am sorry. That is the Lord's prayer and I can  not change the words." So the Colonel hangs up.  After another month of dismal sales, the Colonel panics, and calls  again.  "Listen your Excellency. I really need your help. I'll donate $50  million dollars if you change the words of the daily prayer from  'Give us this day our daily bread' to 'Give us this day our daily  chicken.'" And the Pope responds, "It is very tempting, Colonel  Sanders. The church could do a lot of good with that much money. It  would help us to support many charities. But, again, I must decline.  It is the Lord's prayer, and I can't change the words."  So the Colonel gives up again. After two more months of terrible  sales. The Colonel gets desperate. "This is my final offer, your  Excellency. If you change the words of the daily prayer from, 'Give  us this day our daily bread' to 'Give us this day our daily chicken'  I will donate $100 million to the Vatican." The Pope replies, "Let me  get back to you."  So the next day, the Pope calls together all of his bishops and he  says, "I have some good news and I have some bad news. The good news  is that KFC is going to donate $100 million to the Vatican."  The bishops rejoice at the news. Then one asks about the bad news.  The Pope replies,  "The bad news is that we lost the Wonder Bread account."|`|AA10991102	http://www.dumbvideos.com/thellamasong.h...|`|AA11930838	A duck walks into a bar and asks the bartender "Got any gwapes (grapes)" The Bartender says "No you stupid duck!

That's why Biggie's dead. Nobody in the music world could handle the competition. P.Lo was mad because he was mainstream and Biggie was hardcore. The fans knew this and P.Lo was losing sales over it.|`|AA10429720	Nah, he'd still be in ALL the vidoes in the way dancin and smilin!!! LOL!|`|AA12242229	Most likely...|`|AA11586417	This is the most interesting question that i have seen on answers today.  I don't think he would have.  Biggie was a very skilled rapper.  If he saw that he was bringing his career down.  I think biggie would have did the smart thing and went on to a different record label.  Like the LOX when to the Ruff Ryders.  I mean biggie was puffy's friend.  But he would have put business first.

Are you spelling it right did you type in your name right when you were creating the myspace. Maybe like upper case or lower case sensitive. I am not sure its lower upper case sensitive thought! but give it time if you did create it just shortly ago. Maybe it doesn't show up if you are signed into myspace. Sign out then try searching.

AA12366519	Bi's Life Story (How he became a star)     [1] Childhood   I still can't believe that I'm a singer. Sometimes when I fine my CD among those I own while I arrange them, I feel my heart swelling. It is a true happiness to me that there will be people somewhere who will listen and follow after my dance just like I modeled myself after the dances and songs of Seotaeji and Boys and Deux when I dreamt of becoming a singer. I used to live near Hongik University when I was a child. My mother passed away two years ago, and I now I live with two others, my father and my sister. My sister who's 3 years younger than me (I was born in 1982 and my real name is Jeong Jihun) is so blunt that we are not so close at that time. Both of us are taciturn and we hardly exchange more than two or three sentences all day. I am told that I used to like going out without telling anyone when I was young. There is one incident I remember faintly. It's my leaving home when I was 4. My parents came home from work together but they couldn't find me. So they called the police for adjunction of disappearance and looked for me here and there almost in insanity, but still couldn't find me. A day went by and my parents got a phone call. They said they found me in Ganghwa-do. There was a bus terminal in front of our place, and I think I might have taken the bus from there. They saw the contact number on my wrist band in Ganghwa-do and called my family. Although I can't remember clearly, I have a faint memory of a lady who helped me get on the bus.     [2] I've been an introvert from the begining   Even when I was young, I had been introversive and taciturn like now. It still takes me a long time to get close to people. But once I become close, I talk so much that I am surprised that I can speak so well. I didn't have much talent in studying when I was in elementary school and let the day go by without saying a word. So it was natural that I didn't have a girlfriend who liked me. I was an unnoticeable student in class. If there was anything that people would notice about me is that I was a bit tall. I was always the third or fourth tallest boy in the class. I would always sit there quietly, but one day I stirred it up. It was at the talent show competition among classes during the school trip when I was in the 6th grade. Our class's turn was closing in and nobody volunteered. I kept on watching and felt impatient so told them that I will enter the competition to represent our class. But the response of the kids in our class was much less than flattering. I could hear them say slanders about me from here and there, saying 'why is he representing us?' I got proud and finally it was our class's turn. I stood on the stage. The children concentrated on me and the music was on. I told myself to 'show them something' and danced the dances I saw on the TV and street without a second thought. There was a burst of clapping hands as my stage was over. I felt the fulfilling emotion for the first time, and a thought crossed my mind suddenly. It said, 'Yes, it's dance.'     [3] Depression and an urge to kill myself   I entered Sungmun Junior High as I awakened to dance. By looks, anyone could tell that I was a disorderly student by appearance. In order to learn how to dance, I hung out with older boys who were disorderly and neglected school works. Although they took my money and clothes, I followed them because of one reason that I have to learn how to dance. There was a time when we got caught by the police and taken to the police station while we were practicing at the park near Hongik University because we didn't have anywhere to go and practice dancing and people around us pointed at us saying we are disorderly students. I lied to my father that I am going to the library to study, and there was nothing I could do but neglect my studies because I was busy dancing. As this went on, my grades got worse and worse. I sat for the fist exam of my junior high, and I got average score of 45. It was something I could get by guessing instead of going through the questions. But since I was so tired out dancing that I slept during the examination without solving the questions. Frankly, I was also shocked by the results. My father didn't even treat me like his own son. He told me to leave home and didn't even look at me. If my father had beaten me or gotten extreme with me, I could have become perversed, but I gave myself a lot of thoughts seeing my father like that. As I came to talk to nobody in the family, I fell into a depression and there were time when I even felt the urge to kill myself. So I worried myself sick over it and decided that I need to go better in studies than this, so I committed myself to reading and could recover my scores to a degree.     [4] I promised my dad that I will not do anything bad   Although I hung out with scarey boys to learn how to dance, I promised my father that I will never smoke and do bad things. I still keep my words about not smoking. Our dancing team practiced hard, and entered the national amateur dance competition held at Lotte World, Jamsil, Seoul to confirming our talent. Although I can't remember what year exactly, Pyo Inbong, the comedian, was the MC of the competition. The name of our danding team was 'Challenger.' I entered the competition with four other guys, and I stood in the middle to dance as I was tall. We didn't receive any award though. Later, I heard from Inbong after I became a singer that Gangta, the singer, had also entered the competition. I took interest in rugby when I was in the second grade of junior high. The boys in ruby club looked cool and I practiced amongst the rugby club members of the school nearby, but I felt like I couldn't do both dance and sports well, so I chose dance. Then it came the last year of junior high and I started to worry about my future. My friend went to liberal arts high schools but I looked for one where |`|AA11661285	They r Korean singer.

AA11133450	Food - everything is good, my fav is Sam Wo's in china town on Grant st. and big buck Sung Hung Huen (sp) right off grant and Wash st  Make sure to take a cable car ride - you can make a whole night of it - going to all the neat spots, rest & pubs.  Beaches there are not impresive  Go to big sur or to wine country Sonoma napa Valley  Kamping is pretty cool up by Mt Tam (mt tamapilis) and the Russian River and if you can't drive all the way to big sur then at least drive from Pacifica to Half Moon Bay  And, of course, one day and evening in Sausalito (eve) and Belvadere (day).  Gosh what fond memories this brings back... peace love cough  Thank You for the great question|`|d8bc24712086914871e3fd27a5ef3386aa	yes all the time for the summer?|`|AA12066568	I just moved to SF and I am trying to figure that out myself.  There are great Frommer's books on SF, but I can say that Fisherman's Wharf is a cool place, Union Street rocks, and riding the old cable cars is a lot of fun.  There are too many great places to eat to name them, but getting crab and shrimp bowls, and a bread bowl of Clam Chowder at Fisherman's is an experience you need to have.  Also, look out for the infamous "Bush Man" when you pass the markets where you get the aforementioned food.  He will scare the bejeezes out of you if you don't expect it.  Have fun...and if you find some cool places, let me know!|`|AA10129362	The definition of Bay Area is huge. I'll limit my recommendations to the city of San Francisco.    Museums: I love the de young and MOCA. These are great places to go in the summer during the middle of the day and then at night go out for food.    Activities: Take a hike around the Fort Mason area. That's just under the Golden Gate bridge. Hop across the bridge to Tiburon and Sausalito. They're gorgeous areas and checkout downtown Mill Valley.    Dessert: Golden Bakery on Grant in Chinatown. Ask for the egg tarts. There is always a line out the door for these. They bake them fresh by the minute.    Food: Most restaurants in SF are good. Some of my favorites are 1) Foreign Cinema (they play movies on the wall of their outdoor patio seating area) because the food is always fresh and inventive, yet familiar 2) Campton Place ($$$$$) amazing service and food. Great tasting menu, but very pricy 3) Tu Lan, great imperial rolls and pho (beward dodgy area and old crowded restaurant) for a cheap price.    Snack: Ti Cous, crepe place. very yummy.

Credo che nella scena commerciale odierna vengano presentati alcuni tra i peggiori esempi di artisti in questo genere, tenendo conto dell'esistenza di gente meno conosciuta, ma con un talento molto pi elevato che con i propri strumenti riesce a fare cose veramente buone.

AA10755076	His real name is LaRon James.Born and raised in Harlem, Juelz was certain to make it big. He has been writing rhymes since he was 12 years old. He first started his rap career with his long time friend, Malik, as a rap duo called "Draft Pick". "Draft Pick" had several gigs around New York City while performing together, including Amateur Night at the world famous Apollo Theatre, where they won two weeks in a row. Although the group is not together today, the two members still remain good friends. Juelz continued to believe in himself and his unique style, and there was someone else that believed in him also. His cousin, who is good friends with Cam'ron, decided that it was time for Juelz's unique style to be heard. One day while with Cam, Juelz's cousin drove through his block and had him rhyme for Cam. By the next week Juelz was in the studio recording a verse for the cut, "Double Up", off of Cam'ron's second album, "SDE". Cam'ron believed in Juelz, and after signing to Roc-A-fella Records himself, Juelz received a deal with Roc-A-fella Diplomat Records. Diplomat Records is Cam'ron's new record label, where Juelz is the Vice-President.    Since then, it has been nothing but up hill for Juelz. His level of creativity for rhyming has continued to rise over the past year. He has had solo articles in issues of the XXL Magazine, as well as articles with the Diplomats in XXL and Source Magazine. Juelz is also featured on the Diplomats Volume 1 and 2 albums where you can hear cuts from joints off of his up and coming solo album, soon to be released in August 2003.    He says: "I'm working hard, putting in my all to produce an album that I'm satisfied with and an album that will satisfy my fans. My album is based on my life, the streets, and a new life. PUT ON YOU SEATBELT. IT'S GONNA BE A LONG RIDE."|`|AA12398213	uhhh...not really, i know he has a contract with Dipset and he is a rapper and he was featured on Chris Brown's (he IS SO FINE!)

d36e66dd13ae908606070e8ed86a1f18aa	I believe that what separates the books from the movies is an abundance of sensory description, which makes you feel a part of the fictional world. In movies you might see the rows of sunflowers in the distant and the breeze passing through the dogwoods, but you are too busy watching the lead actors stroll through the park. In the book you smell what they smell and are immersed in the place itself. In a sense, you're the lead character and their experiences are yours. That, I believe, is why one is almost always disappointed after reading a great book, and then seeing the movie. Its all about the senses.|`|2a6d39e8cf548d3a5ecb691278d11e3baa	I think it is simply a time constraint. You just can not fit the detail of a book into 2 12/ hours (give or take).|`|AA12265577	The interpretation can never be as good as the original.

I think it's mostly because if you read the book, and then watch the movie, you notice that the movie leaves out most of the story from the book.  And the story is also changed alot too.  But when you read, you get this mental video going in your head and it is alot better understood than the actual movie, because then you're watching the mental video, that's what you imagine the movie would be like, then it's totally different.|`|134a122be91c2e7d1e93462da7b4f8d8aa	A movie presents you with the director's interpretation of the book.  That means the decisions about all the things in the book that call on the reader's imagination have already been made, so the viewer doesn't get to participate in the experience of the movie the same way the reader gets to participate in experiencing the story in a book.  That being so, most people I know will say they prefer the book version to the movie because the book becomes a customized experience drawing on their own personal imaginations.

AA12067168	I agree with you completely. I saw the movie a second time the other day when it was on TV, and came up with something different, but I think more plausible. Anyway, he's obviously a bit crazy, even before the incident, and so the rabbit, may not really exist, but then you have to ask yourself, what is up with all the coincidences? Well, maybe there's something deeper going on. Maybe that is why the crazy old lady has a real book that explains his situation. Or maybe he is using this lady's crazy book to fuel his own lunacy? But the time travel, that does really happen. So what's going on? Is he crazy, who is the rabbit? Is it all real? Nothing is really explained in the movie, so I guess we're supposed to be confused. That adds to the charm I suppose-- that and the 80's nostalgia.    Anyway, at the end, the time travel aspect becomes real, and we are led to beleive that Donnie as special powers. But if he had special powers, why'd he have to die? To save the world? From what exactly? A worm hole in the sky? How does his death solve that? This is the biggest problem of the story. They don't explain if the world will really end and how.  I think the wreckage was only a single engine, and no passengers, so I don't think anyone really time traveled, just the engine itself.    There are obviously a bunch of interpretations of the movie, but the ending is pretty much the same, no matter how you intreperet it. Because Donnie died, his girl friend never became involved with him and ended up with a whole different life that didn't end with her being run over by Frank the rabbit guy. So he saved the life of his mother, sister, girlfriend and influences everyone he loved in a postive way by dying. He saves his world and everyone in it by dying.    Now, this is just how I see the movie. But truth be told, there's a pretty good explanation at Wikipedia. It turns out, you'd have to listen to the Director's commentary to really understand what the director had in mind. These are things you can't find in the movie, hence the many different interpretations and  confusion. The link is below. This was definitely worth best answer, right? Whew!|`|AA12186555	I haven't seen it.

As far as mixers try Soundcraft, their Spirt boards give you a good bank for the buck, Mackie mixers are always acceptable.|`|AA10640922	go mackie first and then if, and only if you absolutely have to, go jbl speakers. search with a friend who knows what he/she is doing or go to the local music store and ask the live sound guy to help

937a08b16ae1e9beb61e7aa710d282ddaa	Yeah. I know Siti Nurhaliza. She is Malaysian and South East Asia no 1 singer. Her voice is so beautiful. Her personality also are good. She has a lot of fans to support her career as a singer. She also has won many awards in her career and has become the first singer to collect more than 100 awards in her career. She also is the winner at Voice of Asia and in Malaysia, Siti Nurhaliza has won for eight years in a row for Best Female Vocal Performance at Anugerah Industri Muzik since 1999. She also have won The Most Popular Female Artist nine years in row too at Anugerah Bintang Popular.For more detail please go to her official website at www.sitizone.com.|`|AA11661285	Why u want know either I ( someone ) know her or not?

AA12110424	Don't get me wrong, she's very generous.

She does so many wonderful things in this world and does what ever she can to help others she doesn't even know. She was trying to bring awareness to refugees around the world and speaking of her personal experiences with these people. She was trying to convey a very unimportant message. If you were only focusing on her voice and the little things she did wrong then there is something wrong with you. She was speaking from the heart and it is not always easy to find the words. Are you always 100% clear with your words and know exactly what you are going to say before you say it. I'm guessing not. When was the last time you went out of your way to help a complete stranger?

AA10056838	Do they have any KY jelly beans??    Lubed Up    Tom and Mike, two gay men, are on their honeymoon. After a passionate night together, Tom suddenly realises that they have run out of lube, so he says to Mike "I'm just off to the shop to get some more KY Jelly - we've run out!" He also says "and there's to be no wanking while I'm gone, okay?"     "Yeah sure," replies Mike.     Twenty minutes later, Tom returns and on opening the door sees a whole load of c_u_m on the bed.

ed241840a61fecb160bf8e00431b9ebaaa	Get to know the people that work there right away.  If it is a smaller independent store, you are going to be working with the same people everyday.  It helps to really learn what kinds of music they like.  So ask tons of questions your first day from the people that work there.  From experience, people that work in record stores love to share what they know if you just ask.  And know how to alphabetize those artists and bands!  But all in all, just make sure that you ask questions from the people around you, the other employees will like it and so will the customers.  You may be the one that gets them to buy another album they have never heard of, that is the fun part of working in a store like that.      Good luck!!!!!!|`|AA12118274	Make sure they know about your love of music. But dont limit yourself to one kind of music. They are going to want to know that you will be able to help the coustemer looking for Rap, Rock and Classical also.   Tell them you love all kinds of music and will work hard to learn about all of the artists.

AA12012155	A friend and I were allowed to have a rent free caretakers house that sat just inside an old cemetary in Maryland. It was the coolest old house and the cemetary was beautiful (as far as cemetary's go) Old!     Things like ghosts, spirits and cemetaries have never made me afraid really so it was all good.   After spending a late night out, I came home and decided just to lie across the sofa instead of going upstairs. The moon was very bright that night and had the room lit with shadows. We had a cat named Sam and he was downstairs with me as well. As we lay on the sofa suddenly the television had a glow on the screen and started making the static noises a t.v makes when its being either shut on or off. Sam took off up the stairs like a shot of lightening. It was strange but I really didn't feel anything like concern or fright. I still layed comfortably and soon closed my eyes but wasn't asleep. I then felt the sofa sink in right beside me as if someone sat down and of course I opened my eyes thinking it was Sam back. Nothing was there but there was an indent in the sofa as I ran my hand across feeling the weight of whatever was sitting next to me. The spot was cold. I then felt a slight burst of air on my face as if breathing but not warm like breath. Strange thing is, I wasn't afraid. It only lasted about a minute and stopped, the place on the couch went back to normal, a few seconds later the t.v stopped glowing and eventually Sam came downstairs.|`|AA11018732	Once, a long time ago, I was sleeping in my room for the 1st time by myselft (my younger brother and I had shared a room for many years before that) and I woke up in the middle of the night with the feeling that someone or something was on my chest...the pressure was so great  I couldnt take any air in and I couldnt scream no matter how much I tried. It also felt as if my limbs were being held down too because I couldnt lift my arms to see what was on me! After what felt like an eternity, it stopped. It never happened again but, my sister always insisted that the house we grew up in was haunted...it was over 100years old so who knew what the real history of the place was.

c69ffbdf27d070e4e56b01cb86c3a95daa	well, here is my honest opinion:  if you like a couple of bands that are playing, and you have the opportunity to go, by all means do so.   All you have to do is plan well: as soon as you get there make your way to a BIG sign that's located accross from the two stages and check the schedules for which the bands you want to see are playing. Once you know when and where (which of the two stages) then you can plan ahead. If you can, wait by the empty stage at which your band will be playing, while the previous band is playing at the other stage. That way you can have a pretty good spot. That is, of course, if you don't mind being pushed. It is not so bad if you're at the front, because you can still breathe. however, I highly recommend staying at the side or the back if you are bothered by mosh pits and/or pushing. but I think you should be ok. Just take care of yourself. And wear sunscreen.  Much Love ^_^|`|AA10053890	Go!! I would if I could!|`|AA10286558	Man i love Panic! At the Disco and OF COURSE GO!!

Go!!! Warped Tour is AWESOME!!!|`|e54e7123dfd32324ff2af29a3f568c36aa	Yes!!  You should go to Warped Tour!!    And yeah, mosh pits can get a little bad.  You just have to stay on the outside of 'em if it gets too bad.|`|AA11780081	No, not really.  The Warped Tour isn't really the same as it was five-ten years ago.  Now it's more like a showcase for big companies to advertise to young people than it is a showcase of today's music scene.  I went last year in Denver and it was obnoxious how much advertisement there was.      I personally don't think there are many good bands on the tour this year, and all the good ones are on it every other year, (i.e. NOFX, Bouncing Souls, Less Than Jake).  The only reason I would go this year is to see Joan Jett.  I saw Billy Idol last year and it was awesome.  I was really surprised to see all these teenagers singing along to "White Wedding" and "Rebel Yell," considering most of them hadn't been born yet when they came out.      If you do go, check out Against Me!  They're pretty cool, and they have a pretty unique sound.  (Although, if you like Panic! At The Disco, you might not like Against Me! because their music has balls).

Este partido es entre dos fuertes, Alemania tiene la ventaja de ser local y ha tenido un buen papel en el torneo, Argentina ha hecho lo suyo principalmente en la primera ronda.

If you're a typical college student, go to 2nd street (Belmont Station and Shannon's Bay Shore, maybe pop into Acapulco Inn for a beer).  Or go to Club Sachi or the Gaslamp for some good danicin and Dj's, also there's H2O at the Pike.     If you're a little more sophisticated, go to Pine Street, where there are a few clubs and a Latin club.     If you like the punk scene, go to Alex's bar, Red Room, V Room, House of Hayden, and/or Ferns. I may just see you there.    Have fun!|`|AA10988638	DIPIAZZA'S ON BELFLOWER & PCH    FRIDAY NIGHTS ROCK

AA10747269	whats not to love about it? I still watch the re-runs every night! this show was / is highly addictive...   first off I love Sci-fi,   they  had great stories... so many what ifs????   Mulder and Sculley were a great team.... the believer, and the questioner....     investigating together... and the situations they would get into !  the smoking man... was   interesting..even the geek squad was  amusing!... they really had some great writers on that show...I think it ended way too soon, there was so much more they could have done and explored... and many unanswered questions, about the aliens ,the  black oil, the baby..... and on and on...  it really frustrated me when they   ended the show...I'm a sci-fi junkie...lol|`|15cf554df4d92900d32f7ee6c0c7521faa	I liked the show because it wasn't "cheesafied" with the whole aliens-thing. scully and mulder made a good team and fit in their roles.|`|AA11713235	I love the X-files!

I remember this one episode that still haunts me. . .I don't actually rmember all of it, but at the end, Mulder kills himself. . .and yet the show went on?    It confuses me, mostly because I never saw the episode that came after that one (as it was a rerun), so I was sort of left hanging. . .  When Mulder, was replaced by Dogget, I almost stopped watching. . .and when Scully was replaced by Reyes (is that how you spell it?) I did stop watching. . .I hated Dogget and Reyes with a passion. . .still do.|`|7bb7d08dbca23184a0e9e6fe9851ad3eaa	HELL YEAH ; Which episode's are fake , which ones are based on actual events?|`|ac283cef6356acf9a671a52fdf5923c5aa	I used to love that show!! I got really addicted to eveything that had to do with the supernatural when the show was on air. I loved Mulders sarcasm and sinicism. And I had a huge crush on Alex Crisheck (I dont know if thats spelled right, but you know who i mean) it was a shame that they killed him off. I cried. Oh and the black oil to was cool.|`|db9bd475ce40c03000f8917a2fc953c7aa	What was not to love... except the last 2 Mulder-less seasons.|`|AA11102769	Yes Im a fan.

I found one TINY crack in the ebony fretboard, and they replaced it no questions asked. As a matter of fact, because I am in Japan, they sent me a replacement before I ever had the other one in the mail so that I wouldn't have to wait very long. To be quite honest, I wouldn't waste time on non tonewoods. There are plenty of projects online that go step by step. Just take your time and you'll be happy with the result.

46c16d4212b528cec10a1e74b5a79f10aa	I saw it. It's about a Jewish father (might have been a German one, don't remember exactly) that was basically trying to keep the Nazis from getting (and killing) his son. Throughout the movie, the father continues to convince the boy that the whole thing is a game, and that in order to win, he must not be discovered. If he wins, he gets his own tank. Long story short, the father dies hiding the boy, but the boy lives to see the Americans free the town he's in. Guess what pulls up to pick him up... a tank (thanks daddy!).     It's kinda funny, kinda sad all at the same time. REALLY GOOD MOVIE though.|`|AA11320481	nope|`|ecf656f6e2dd43e3e8add0faa45c1a87aa	A wonderful fact-based film - among the best WWII/Holocaust related films. I recall 'Europa Europa' as being very heavily hyped at the time of its' release, and generating controversy ever since - but it is very well made, with great performances throughout. Below the surface, it also works well as a meditation on the elusiveness of identity, and loyalty to one's identity, and as such it has tough things to say. This film deserves its' acclaim, and it should be remembered that this is one man's story - very well-told.

Die hard fans of the band are well aware of his early contributions to their sound & how it influenced them even after his departure in 1968.  A total recluse, suffering from delusions & denial, his life was anything but typical after his mental breakdown.  His suffering has come to an end, but unfortunately many questions will live on for PF fans, who prob will still wonder if Syd would've ever come out of exile.|`|4426ef1b8052c09d6ebbbde93154bc34aa	I think the sadness began when Syd was no longer able to function as a contributor to his creation.

Shane was born on Christmas Day in Kent, when his parents were visiting relatives. They lived in Puckhaun, county Tipperary, Ireland. His mother was a great singer and traditional dancer and had worked as a model in Dublin. His father was very interested in literature and writing. They lived in a big farmhouse with until Shane was six, when they moved to London. In 1971 he got a schoolarship and was accepted into a top public school. Shane was caught in posession of drugs and was kicked out after a year. One of his friends at the time was Berni France, later in The Popes.    In 1976 he sawThe sex Pistols and became part of the punk movement. The same year he made the papers for the first time. He was up front at a Clash gig and a girl cut him in the side of the head with a broken bottle. Someone took a photo and the picture of him covered in blood made the papers. They wrote that he had got his ear bitten off and that turned Shane into a semi-legend at the time.    Shane, who had rechristened himself Shane O'Hooligan, worked in a record store. He created his own fanzine called "Bondage" and formed the group Nipple Erectors with his friend Shanne Bradley (later in The Men They Couldn't Hang.). Their first single was "King Of The Bop" (1976) and it was produced by Stan Brennan, Shane's employer in the record store. They changed their name to The Nips and recorded three more singles. The line-up was changing all the time and included guitarist James Fearnley (later in The Pogues) and drummer Jon Moss (later in Culture Club). They were support acts for The Clash and The Jam. Paul Weller of The Jam liked them a lot and produced the single "Happy Song". The Nips broke up at the end of 1980 and released a live album called "Only The End Of The Beginning".    At the same time as Shane was in The Nips he also played guitar in another punkband called The Millwall Chainsaws which featured, on vocals, Spider Stacy. Shane and his friend Jem Finer were also involved in a backing band for a school teacher. Shane played bass, Jem guitar and Ollie Watts from The Millwall Chainsaws was the drummer.    The Millwall Chainsaws became the prototype to what was going to be Pogue Mahone (and later became The Pogues). In spring 1981, inspired by The Dubliners, they renamed themselves The New Republicans. Shane was the leadsinger and they played one gig at Richard Strange's club Cabaret Futura. The audience started pelting them with chips, so the management pulled the plugs thinking the band was from the IRA.    Shane began writing new songs like "Streams Of Whiskey" and he and Jem began rehersing together in 1981. They tried busking, but they didn't do well. In Covent Garden a man told them: "Very few people have come here and failed what we like to call The Covent Garden Seal Of Quality. I'm sorry, you have failed."    Shane and Jem auditioned their neighbour, Andrew Ranken, on drums, but he was the singer in another group and did not have the time to participate in another project. Shane remembered that the former Nips guitarist had taken piano lessons, so he was roped in an the accordion and showed up on James Fearnley's doorstep, the accordion in a landry bag. Jem learned to play the banjo and John Hasler on drums completed the line-up. A few nights before their first gig Shane phoned Spider and asked him if wanted to come a long. The group didn't have a name and among the suggestions were The Men They Couldn't Hang and The Noisy Boysies. Spider then came up with Pogue Mahone, gaelic for "kiss my ****", and it stuck.    Pogue Mahone's first gig was at The Pindar Of Wakefield on October the 4th 1982. The day after Shane also managed to find a bass player. It was Cait O'Riordan, who he had met a few years ago when she bought a Nips record from the record shop he was working in. John Hasler was sacked from the band and temporary they used different drummers including Alec Palao from The Sting-rays. In March 1983 Shane and Jem's original choice Andrew Ranken became a permanent member.    Shane's days with The Pogues ended in November 1991 during a tour in Japan. His story and the band's story differ on whether he quit or was sacked (although one source blamed Yoko Ono). Following his departure from The Pogues, Shane recorded a duet version of Louis Armstrong's "What A Wonderful World" together with Nick Cave for Christmas 1992. In 1993 he collaborated with the Breton singer Alan Stivell (of The Specials) and the French band Soldat Louis. Shane also formed a new band with Mo O'Hagan (guitar) and Berni France (bass) called The London Contemporary Five. He opened the next year performing at the Brit Awards singing "Gloria" together with Van Morrison.    Shane appeared on The Jesus & Mary Chain's album "Stoned & Dethroned". He also recorded his first solo album called "The Snake" and his backing band was now called The Popes. Their first single "The Church Of The Holy Spook" was only released in 10.000 ex. The picture on the cover, a crucified Shane, caused a lot of trouble. The second single was "That Woman's Got Me Drinking" also got a lot of attention because actor and teen idol Johnny Depp played guitar on it and also appeared in the video. The album was a mix of traditional Irish music and rock 'n' roll and was produced by The Pogues' old sound technician Dave Jordan together with Shane. Among the guests were Jem Finer, Spider Stacey, guitarist Brian Robertson (formerly of Thin Lizzy) and John Sheahan and Barney McKenna (of The Dubliners). In addition to Mo and Berni, The Popes are: Tom MacAnimal (banjo), Paul McGuiness (guitar), Danny Heatley (drums) and Colm O'Manola (whistle). After the record was finished O'Manola was replaced by Paul Conlon (whistle), who only lasted until 19|`|273471487dfabbfdd49cb52f6013974faa	Bo|`|867660e79200de74f18b315b8edf819caa	ehm....|`|89aaa2704d74923518ffd841512fdd84aa	grandissimo leader dei pogues, fuori di testa come pochi!!|`|06bb929bfe9264823022f353a202340baa	Praticamente a me non hai detto nulla..... non so agli altri. ciao amico    P.S.

AA10219457	I wouldn't say that this song really relates to me...but it was a great song and it was from the year I was born (1979).  I'm also comfortably numb...but in a different way.    Comfortably Numb (Pink Floyd)    Hello?  Is there anybody in there?  Just nod if you can hear me.  Is there anyone at home?  Come on, now,  I hear you're feeling down.  Well I can ease your pain  Get you on your feet again.  Relax.  I'll need some information first.  Just the basic facts.  Can you show me where it hurts?    There is no pain you are receding  A distant ship, smoke on the horizon.  You are only coming through in waves.  Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying.  When I was a child I had a fever  My hands felt just like two balloons.  Now I've got that feeling once again  I can't explain you would not understand  This is not how I am.  I have become comfortably numb.    O.K.  Just a little pinprick.  There'll be no more aaaaaaaaah!  But you may feel a little sick.  Can you stand up?  I do believe it's working, good.  That'll keep you going through the show  Come on it's time to go.    There is no pain you are receding  A distant ship, smoke on the horizon.  You are only coming through in waves.  Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying.  When I was a child   I caught a fleeting glimpse  Out of the corner of my eye.  I turned to look but it was gone  I cannot put my finger on it now  The child is grown,   The dream is gone.  I have become comfortably numb.|`|AA10211580	1978 for me girlfriend:    - "Hot Stuff"  - "We are Family"  - "Celebration"  - "Bad Girls"|`|AA10173962	havent look at it. imma do it now|`|728ad832a4b0e8e5114f6f26c4463796aa	I can't remember anything when I was that young.|`|AA10738530	1961.

Mor de risa cuando despus de que al pobre Cristo ya que le rompieron cada huesecito y arrancado cada pedacito de piel, se les zafa a los romanos la cruz donde est clavado y se va de cara al piso arenoso con todo y cruz. Eso, y el cuervito que baja a sacarle el ojo a uno de los ladrones crucificados ya fueron el colmo del sadismo. No que no lo pueda disfrutar, pero como ya dije, se me hizo que la crueldad exagerada es el nico bastin de la pelcula. Y casi el nico argumento. Los personajes estn demasiado polarizados. Creo que el nico que se salva de esa polarizacin es el personaje de Poncio Pilatos. El nico detalle que me gust mucho de la pelcula, es cuando al final cae una gota de lluvia, simbolizando a una lgrima del dios cristiano. Se me hizo un momento corto en tiempo pero con un simbolismo muy funcional y emotivo. Tambin me gustara decir que fue mejor de lo que esperaba tomando en cuenta que era primera pelcula que diriga Mel Gibson: me la haba imaginado peor.    Ahora va la otra:    La pelcula de Scorcese tiene detrs una historia muy creativa, unas excelentes actuaciones, momentos muy emocionantes y extra?os a la vez (la aparicin de la serpiente negra en la tienda en el desierto), ancdotas muy bien relatadas y lgicas (el mismo Jess murindose de miedo cuando tras intentar resucitar a Lzaro, ste de repente se levanta, Lzaro siendo acuchillado por motivos polticos poco despus de haber sido resucitado, la duda constante del Jess-hombre sobre si realmente l es el hijo de su dios o no, etc.) Creo que tras la pelcula no slo hubo una lectura profunda de los textos bblicos, sino una reflexin muy inteligente que hizo que le pudieran dar un giro a la historia tantas veces ya contada y recontada. Los personajes de la biblia cobran una dimensin humana sorprendente y profunda. La pelcula adems tiene un par de momentos en que lo que uno crey entender se vuelve polvo y la historia toma una nueva direccin que hace a todo el relato an ms interesante.    En escala de 1 a 10: La Pasin: 2. La Tentacin: 10|`|edb87c8262d3bc1414e3f316843c37ebaa	Por supuesto que La ltima Tentacin, porque es una alternativa y a mi opinin muy vlida y posible tal vez (claro, posible en la historia del Nazareno), basada quiz en evangelios apcrifos, como el recin revelado Evangelio de Judas.  Y respecto a algunas repuestas, no es la primera que dirige Mel Gibson, recuerda a Corazn Valiente y El Hombre sin Rostro. Y para algunos la Biblia es considerada una novela tambin.

53a1a85284c35274c9e8966f9e2efdddaa	Two sixes are called "Boxcars"    Threes and fours have no real special names, except that in the dice game "Craps", a three is "Craps", along with a two or twelve.  (In simple terms, rolling craps on your first roll means you lose).    If you roll a four that consists of a two on each die, you would call that a "hard four".  Likewise, double three is a "hard six", double fours is a "hard eight", and double fives is a "hard ten".    Craps dealers usually have pet names for numbers that help players easily understand which number has been rolled, since some numbers sound similar.  I have heard dealers say "Yo-leven" for eleven (to distinguish it from seven) and say "Five, fever" for five (to distinguish it from nine).|`|7c9f9910002678f3862c0e32cd025802aa	No special name except for box cars - pair of sixes|`|AA12248245	Pair of sixes is boxcars. 3 and 4 is just 7.|`|AA11991489	Pair of sixes is "Boxcars"--no special name with 3s and 4s except you want them together then you call it"great!"|`|AA12287864	the only one with a special name is two ones,witch is snake eyes.and two sixes witch is boxcars.|`|98635c58f90100c4bb26a251b2f24a76aa	there is no special name for calling any of these they just call them a pair of 3,4,or 6.

Pero Piscis considera que Acuario carece de emocin porque l o ella define el amor como una experiencia intensa. Pronto el Pez se puede marchar en busca de una carnada emocional en otra parte.

Piscis exige poco tiempo, lo que es perfecto para el ocupado Acuario. Pero si a Piscis se le niega cari?o, l o ella se marchar a buscarlo a otra parte.

2b39212589470e8c0d38b20cd6020d7caa	Tras una encuesta realizada a 4 personas hemos llegado a las siguientes conclusiones:  1.- Probablemente la raza humana sea una de las especies mas estupidas de todo los seres semi-inteligentes que habitan o han habido nuestro universo.    2. La gallina es una especie conocida por la mayoria de las personas (3 de cada 4 encuestados conocian el significado de "gallina" )    3. "huevo", "uevo", "huebo", "uhevo" o "uhebo" es una palabras dificilisima de escribir (solo 1 de cada 4 encuestados sabe que huebo se escribe con "b".  Porque como la mayoria de las personas conoce, siempre se escribe "b" antes de "p".    4.- Yo creo que fue el huevo, pero el huevo no era de gallina, sino de gallo, porque hace mucho, mucho tiempo las gallinas eran hemafroditas y tenian algunas diferencias con los actuales gallinas.    - Tenian 2 patas traseras y 2 delanteras  - Tenian una enorme cola  - Algunas podian volar  - Otras no....  - Habia gallinas carnivoras y hervivoras  - Habia gallinas de muchos tipos, mas grandes y mas peque?as  - El color de su predominante era verde  - Solian tener escamas  - Y las solian llamar dinopollos o dinogallinas.    Estos datos no desmientes otras teorias, que defienden que la postura de que la gallina fue mucho antes que el huevo, puesto que se trataba de una gallina que no ponia huevos y tras el encuentro con el dinopollo comenzo ha poner huevo de una mezcla entre dinopollo y gallina.  Claro que todo esto solo son hipotesis....|`|AA11111840	otra vez la misma cosa....que poca imaginacion!|`|195bf814b1c3d1d19bbe98b3309a18ddaa	YO PIENSO QUE LA GALLINA LA VERDAD NOSE......................|`|AA10627619	la gallina...porque segun la evolucion de los seres vivos primero las especies marinas desarrollaron la habilidad de caminar fuera del mar, una ves dominada la superficie desarrollaron alas y asi dominaron el cielo y para poder volar en algun momento de la evolucion existio un animal anfibio que desarrollo la manera de producir huevos...pero eso paso con la ayuda de cientos de miles de a os de evolucion...un saludo desde cd. obregon, sonora. mexico.|`|a467c7845266d9a951c67988864ee542aa	que nunca vieron a los polivoces a chano y chon?  quiubo chano?  quiubo chon ?  oye que fue primero ? el huevo o la gallina?  no se yo no fui al banquete????  uuuuu  uuuu|`|e751d6698843b1c527fa271f365a7f53aa	los unicelulares ... misma pregunta misma respuesta ...|`|e834fac1f2609ccfdb434c575052fd89aa	LA GALLINA POR QUE QUIEN PONDRA EL HUEVO.

Anything is possible, if you love someone enough, depsite their opposition(cancer) in true love you will do anything to be with that someone.  even if you only have each other for a little while. it's the present that counts, not the past or future.  Live in the moment, and follow your heart.  That movie showed what TRUE love really was!!!!!|`|AA11623536	i think it may have been a true story and i think it is possible i luv thats movie sooo much the guy is soooo sweet.|`|AA12306282	I think it actually could be a true story.

I am getting married in less than a year and I am that in love with my fiance. .... the way we met and the fact that we are two total opposites yet work the same is wonderful.... I think that everyone should have love like that in their life and If they do not i think they do they didnt find the one they were meant to be with yet. I think that everyone can fall in love like that... the people that dont are just too cynical ... or to ready to jump in to the first relationship just because they kind of like each other.

Borden fue esencialmente una continuacin del Roger Healey.  El programa fue un gran xito, ms que Mi Bello Genio y Daily fue inmortalizado en los anales de la historia de la televisin.

When to piano finishes it's song the picture will open up and the bags of silver will be there. Next leave the saloon and go back to the general store. On the right side of the cash register there is a wagon wheel. Next click on the scales. Start on the right hand side and put the bags on the scale 4 on each side. Which ever side is heavier take those bags out and the add 2 of the bags from the side that was light to the other side of the scale. Then which ever is lighter then choose the bag in front.

e3527f8189ace5668b2ac3d78bae7302aa	Yes, but christianity probably deserves to be disrespected for its numerous sins against women.  For example, thanks to doctrines like original sin, which was often interpreted as blaming all women for the "fall of man," not allowing women to be priests up until the present time (and they are still not allowed in catholicism, conservative branches of Christianity, Judiaism and Islam seem to be sexist in this regard), and promoting crimes against women such as the "Magdalen Asylum" in Ireland, Christianity has been disrespecting and abusing women for centuries.  Madonna staging a crucifixion of herself is a great symbol for what the church has been doing to women all along.  Don't sow what you don't want to reap, and if you can't stand it, fix it.|`|AA11491405	It's all for show and nothing more|`|AA11551923	madonna is disrespectful to everyone thats what keeps her in the spotlight....|`|AA11438408	No one realy takes her seriously.

She is being purposely disrespectful in order to cause a scene and receive the accompanying publicity..... Looks like it's working too don't it? ;)

AA10625337	As I noted in another thread:    Heather is the best choice overall.    Keith is a good cook, but doesn't seem to have the personality to lead a kitchen.  I suspect he'll lose in the final, UNLESS Heather puts too much pressure on herself and cracks.

It is a diuretic so it will make you pee more and it will make you feel less drunk because it will wake you up. I don't think you should drive a car if you are drinking all night because you had a cup of coffee but from personal experience it helps sober me up. It also helps with hangovers.|`|AA11741556	Did you write this when you were drunk?
75442f0b5a317552cd505470c96c9fddaa	1.- "El Sirenito" de Rigo Tovar, por que nac cuando mis paps cumplieron un a?o de casados y haciendo clara alusin a mi infancia en la costa de Veracruz que pase al lado de mi Abuelita Lucrecia (q. e. p. d.).    2.- "Julieta" de Fernando Delgadillo, que habla de un amor infantil, refirindome esta vez, a la primera ni?a de la cual me enamor a mis nueve a?os, Citlalli.    3.- "Hey Jude" de los Beatles, que enmarcara la poca cuando mis padres se separaron y mi Ta Edith se hizo cargo de mi educacin, forjndome como la persona que ahora soy.    4.- "My Girl" de The Temptations, que siempre me har recordar a mi primera novia, una ni?a llamada Anglica.    5.- "Raquel" de La Misma Gente (creo que as se llamaba el grupo, pero no estoy seguro), es una salsa muy bailable que me trae recuerdos de la Secundaria y de una novia que tuve del mismo nombre, que, al igual que en la cancin, simple y sencillamente, se fue.    6.- "La Persona Ideal", otra salsa que servira como opertura para la parte ms dramtica de la pelcula, cuando entra a mi vida la mujer ms especial que he tenido la suerte de tener como pareja.    7.- "Se le apag la luz" de Alejandro Sanz, que, despus de una secuencia en automviles a alta velocidad tipo persecucin, servira de marco para plasmar en imgenes el fin de mi relacin con Ella, sin duda, "la ni?a de mi vida"    8.- "Show must go on" de Queen, marcando una poca de depresin, resigancin y mucha esperanza, cuando tuve que superar el trauma de su prdida y seguir adelante, un perodo de sincera soledad.    9.- "Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots (pt. 2)" del disco homnimo de los Flaming Lips, meloda (?) que utilizara para reflejar el perodo de inestabilidad, crecimiento y revolucin que vino despus de lo anterior, y en la que conoc a otras tres mujeres, que me hicieron feliz y que son muy importantes para m: Jessica, Mirel y Giovanna.    10.- "Las Flores" de Caf Tacvba, con toda mi dedicacin, admiracin y cari?o para Carmen, una ni?a realmente especial a la que tuve el placer de amar con todo mi corazn y que me ense? muchas cosas. La cancin hara alusin en mi pelcula a que ahora me encuentro en paz con su persona, al grado de que puedo asegurar que hay un antes y un despus de que la conoc.    11.- "Digital Love" de Daft Punk, como un gui?o de ojo al espectador que conozca bien la historia de la pelcula que a este punto se habr vuelto bastante complicada y como siempre, con un enorme abrazo Mxico-Tijuana, de donde es Naye, quien sin duda alguna, me devolvi algo que crea perdido: la Fe.    12.- "Carismtico" de Babasnicos, que describe ms o menos mi realidad actual ("Algunas noches, soy fcil... No acato lmites"), y en la que relatara los amoros ms recientes, libres de compromisos y prejuicios. El inicio del Renacimiento que estoy viviendo hoy en da.    Bonus Track.- "The Scientist" de Coldplay sera elegida como la cancin para escucharse mientras pasan los crditos, haciendo una recapitulacin de las mujeres que han influenciado mi vida hasta ahora, y dejando ver al final de la msica una dedicatoria y un agradecimiento a mi Madre.    Como se puede ver, estara variadito el soundtrack (que por cierto, refleja los cambios reales en cuanto a mis gustos musicales se refiere) por que variadita ha sido mi vida, sobre la cual seguramente escribir una autobiografa basada en la cual, hara mi pelcula. Tal autobiografa, y ha modo de sarcasmo a la del gran autor Gabriel Garca Mrquez, tendra el ttulo de "Vivir para contarlas", contando mi vida en captulos hasta el da de hoy, que llevaran el nombre de las mujeres que ya he mencionado.    Buensima pregunta, vaya que me puso a pensar, debera de haber ms como esta. ?Felicidades!|`|AA11003158	La pelcula se llamara "Un loco corazn"    El soundtrack estara formado por:    1.

AA11124594	You have to copy the contents of the DVD to your computer's hard drive first.  ITunes probably comes up automatically when you put the DVD into the drive.  Close iTunes without clicking on anything in it.    Using "My Computer," open the DVD by right-clicking on the drive and choosing "explore."  Drag and drop the music folders into the area of your hard drive where you keep your own music.  (If you are not sure where that is, right click on a song in the iTunes library and choose "show song file.")  When finished, remove the DVD from the drive.     Once the files are copied to your hard drive, leave "My Computer" open to the folder(s) where you put them.  Open iTunes and drag and drop these folders into the library.      That should add the songs from your hard drive to iTunes.  You will probably also still have the links in iTunes library to the DVD.  To remove these, look for "Show Duplicate Songs" in the Edit menu.  That should bring up both copies.      Probably the links to the DVD will have a different "Date Added" than the links to the songs on your hard drive.  Click on the "Date Added" column to sort by date.  (If you don't have that column, click on "Options" in the Edit menu, and add it.)     If the DVD links don't have a different "Date Added" you will probably have to remove them manually, one by one.     HIghlight all the songs that were added on the date you added the DVD, right click on the group, and choose "Clear" from the drop-down menu.  If you are asked if you want to remove the files, choose "Remove."  If you are asked if you want send the files to the recycle bin, say no.  That should keep you from removing physical music files from your computer.     (If you accidentally put things in the recycle bin that you wanted to keep, right click on the recycle bin to open it, right click on the items you want to keep, and choose "restore."  If you clear music from the iTunes library that you want to add to the library again, just drag and drop the files back into the library.)    When you are finished removing duplicate songs from the library, look at the bottom of the screen.  You will see a message that  says "Showing Duplicate Songs" and a button below that which says "Display All Songs."  Click on the button to show your entire library again.|`|AA11272382	You can try a couple of things one is create a new folder and copy and paste into this folder.

AA11003158	Las series televisivas poseen unos parmetros fijos como:   ?Un grupo reducido de personajes fijos:   ?Pocos decorados  ?Estn realizados en Estudio, lo que conlleva un absoluto control de los efectos, la iluminacin o el posicionamiento de las cmaras.  ?La estructura de las tramas se amolda a los cortes publicitarios.     Las telenovelas son una clasificacin de las series de televisin que tienen frecuencia de temtica melodramtica de gran cantidad de episodios grabados en vdeo y de media hora o una hora de duracin. Tradicionalmente eran de procedencia latinoamericana.    Otros formatos de TV son:    programas divulgativos y educativos no documentales   ? formatos del tipo magazn o revista divulgativa (de libros, de medioambiente, de actividades artesanales...)  ? concursos de preguntas y respuestas sobre aspectos de cultura general;   ? retransmisiones (en directo o de grabaciones) de conciertos, conferencias, actuaciones artsticas;  ? agendas culturales;   ? programas de cocina;   ? programas de divulgacin cientfica;   ? reportajes de investigacin...    programas documentales.   Pretenden divulgar conocimientos, acercar de manera clara, sencilla y atractiva grandes temas (culturales, histricos, polticos, sociales, de investigacin cientfica, de animales,...) a un sector de pblico muy amplio.    Programas musicales|`|6ad02357b38a4e1da1dacfdfbfff11c4aa	una serie de television se caracteriza por abarcar un tema especifico incluyendo muchas variantes sin caer en el melodrama   justamente lo que es una novela|`|970e10bfc8aeec506242503dc92f9452aa	No s ni me replante mucho esta pregunta. Pero la telenovela tiene un poco ms de realismo, como si estuviramos expectando la vida del vecino a travz de una ventana. Una pelcula tambin tiene su argumento pero lleva coreografas, temas y actores de reparto; relacionadas a ciencia ficccin o del viejo far west; etc, etc,. Las novelas se toman como algo real.

El juego de la vida porque a mi me gusta el futbol y ademas habia 4 chicas con historias que eran interesantes, Dark angel porque eran un grupo de chicos que formaron parte de un proyecto y los hicieron soldados. Sin familia y luego de escaparse de ese lugar, se encuentran y pelean por sobrevivir . Ademas uno de ellos est barbaro y Betty la fea porque cambi con ese tema de la chica rica y el chico pobre y creo una historia de amor en un marco moderno y en el que se muestran dos realidades totalmente distintas.|`|17802e8823422ec8baa848facc09a674aa	Coincido contigo.

cadf999dee8a3bbb9757762db3a74755aa	What is the difference between MP3 and MP4 and which do you consider to be the better format?    For those new to the digital music world, the MP3 and MP4 formats are compression technologies for converting standard analog audio tracks (like those on a commercial music CD) to smaller digital computer files.    The primary reason digital music formats have become so popular is that they deliver high quality sound at roughly one tenth the size of the uncompressed original. As a point of reference, a standard Audio CD can hold roughly 20 songs while a CD encoded with MP3 files can hold as many as 200 songs.     MP3   MP4   Audio Format   iPod   FairPlay   DRM   AAC     Normally when sound is compressed, the quality is dramatically diminished, but many empires were launched because of the MP3 format and its ability to deliver high compression rates with a minimum loss of sound quality.    The MP3 format became an official standard in 1992 and began the chain of events that eventually created many popular music encoding programs and playback devices.    Today, the sheer quantity of small handheld devices that can hold thousands of songs is mind-boggling, but the undisputed leader (by a wide margin) is Apple's iPod, despite the fact it was a latecomer to the MP3 player party.    A big reason for the huge success of Apple's music device was the launch of the iTunes online music store. It was the first commercially successful attempt at selling music at 99 cents per song but required an iPod if you wanted to take your purchased music mobile.    At the time, Apple was successful (when others weren't) in convincing the music industry to allow it to sell copyrighted music in a digital format because of something known as FairPlay digital rights management (DRM). Remembering that this all came on the tails of the massive music piracy problem created by the original Napster file sharing system (Napster is now a legitimate online music company), Apple had to demonstrate that it could control how these digital files were used.    This is where the AAC format (Advanced Audio Coding, commonly referred to as MP4) came into the picture. Because Apple used a proprietary file format, it was able to limit how each file purchased on its system was used, which meant a single user could not purchase a song and share it with others.    Along with this digital rights management system, Apple also made claims that the sound compression technology was superior to the old MP3 format. While the technical data may support this claim, the reality is that most listeners don't have the playback equipment (speakers) or the ears to tell any difference.    What is relevant about music purchased on the iTunes system in AAC or MP4 format is that it can only be played back in the iTunes software or on an iPod, while the MP3 format is supported by all music devices (including the iPod).    Your choice of playback systems will be the primary driver of which format is best for you, so be sure you check your players supported formats before you begin buying or encoding your music.|`|90233fe8e17688cf6dacc0e7f67ba63daa	i have no clue. mp3 is a good way to make a URL out of sound. mp4 is there to make fun of mp3 if you ask me.|`|3d4232f9ed8a913b8c1077a52b6b51e1aa	mp4 allows you to play n watch video clips|`|AA11102952	MP3 is shortened term for MPEG - Layer 3.

e97b0e4f7732a0138b99bdbd225c1672aa	I've watched two episodes of 'Poker Face' in the hope that maybe the second time it would be better but it wasn't and it isn't. I found it boring. Too fussy and slightly awkward to watch in places. Like for instance, that 'countdown' with the cheesy almost too-American voice over counting down '10, 9, 8...'.     Ant and Dec have been exploited to the extent where they have become those crooning, botox-filled, white-teeth, cheese-bucket types you see in those American 'Infomercials'. Pretty tragic really.    The actual game i would say is boring, predictable and i cannot get into it at all. I think it's a game for idiots. And I'd rather spend my time doing something more productive rather than watch idiots with an IQ lesser than that of cavemen winning money for doing jack.|`|31bbbbdfef1797490eb1e8f1036ec502aa	I have seen 15 minutes of it and it's shite.

AA10056838	Cerificate For Sex     There was a fellow talking to his buddy one day.     The first fellow said, "I don't know what to get my wife for her birthday.  She has everything, and besides, she can afford to buy anything she wants, so I'm stumped."    His buddy said, "I have an idea. Why don't you make up a certificate that says she can have two hours of great sex, any way she wants it.  She'll probably be thrilled!"    So, the first fellow did just that.    The next day his buddy asked, "Well, did you take my suggestion?  How'd it turn out?"    The first fellow replied,  "She loved it. She jumped up, thanked me, kissed me on the mouth, and ran out the door yelling, 'I'll see you in two hours'!"|`|AA10117328	A blonde is standing at The Gates Of Heaven when she hears horrible screams of pain and torture coming from inside.    She says to St. Peter, "What's going on?"    He says, "That's the sound of new angels getting big holes drilled into their backs for their wings, and small holes drilled into their heads for their halos."    She says, "Heaven sounds terrible. I think maybe I'd rather go to Hell."    St. Peter says,"In Hell, you'll be constantly raped and sodomized."    She says, "That's okay. I've already got holes for that."      An old farmer decided it was time to get a new rooster for his hens. The current rooster was still doing an okay job, but he was getting on in years and the farmer figured getting a new rooster couldn't hurt. So he buys a new cock from the local rooster emporium, and turns him loose in the barnyard. Well, the old rooster sees the young one strutting around and he's a little worried about being replaced. He walks up to the new bird. "So you're the new stud in town? I bet you really think you're hot stuff don't you? Well I'm not ready for the chopping block yet. I'll bet I'm still the better bird. And to prove it, I challenge you to a race around that hen house over there. We'll run around it ten times and whoever finishes first gets to have all the hens for himself." Well, the young rooster was a proud sort, and he definitely thought he was more than a match for the old guy. "You're on," he said, "and since I'm so great, I'll even give you a head start of half a lap. I'll still win easy!" So the two roosters go over to the henhouse to start the race with all the hens gathering to watch. The race begins and all the hens start cheering the old rooster on. After the first lap, the old rooster is still maintaining his lead. After the second lap, the old guy's lead has slipped a little -- but he's still hanging in there. Unfortunately, the old rooster's lead continues to slip each time around, and by the fifth lap he's just barely in front of the young fella. By now the farmer has heard the commotion. He runs into the house, gets his shotgun and runs into the barnyard figuring a fox or something is after his chickens. When he gets there, he sees the two roosters running around the henhouse, with the old rooster still slightly in the lead. He immediately takes his shotgun, aims, fires, and blows the young rooster away. "Damn. That's the third gay rooster I've bought this month."       MAN: I'd like to buy some dog food.  CHECKOUT LADY: Do you have a dog?   MAN: Yes.   CHECKOUT LADY: Where is he?   MAN: He's at home.   CHECKOUT LADY: I'm sorry, I can't sell this dog food to you unless I see the dog. Store policy.   The next day, the man returns.   MAN: I'd like to buy some cat food.  CHECKOUT LADY: Do you have a cat?   MAN: Yes.   CHECKOUT LADY: Well...where is he?   MAN: He's at home!   CHECKOUT LADY: Sorry, I can't sell this cat food to you unless I see your cat.   The next day the man returns.   CHECKOUT LADY: What's in the sack?   MAN: Put your hand inside.  CHECKOUT LADY: Hmmm...It's warm and moist! What is it?  MAN: I would like to buy some toilet paper.       One day as President Clinton was getting off the helicopter in front of the White House, he had a baby pig under each arm. The Marine guard snapped to attention, salutes, and said: ''Nice pigs, sir.'' The President replied, ''These are not pigs, these are authentic Arkansas Razorback Hogs. I got one for Hillary, and I got one for Chelsea.'' The Marine again snapped to attention, saluted, and replied, ''Nice trade, sir'''       Two men went hunting. Joe had been hunting all his life, but Steve was hunting for the first time. Joe told Steve to sit down and not make a sound. So he did.   But when Joe got 100 yards away, he heard a scream. "I thought I told you to be quiet!" he said.   "Well, I was when the snake bit me," said Steve. "And I was when the bear attacked me... but when the two chipmunks crawled up my pant leg and said, 'Should we eat them or take them with us,' I screamed."       Joe was moderately successful in his career, but as he got older he was increasingly hampered by incredible headaches. When his personal hygiene and love life started to suffer, he sought medical help. After being referred from one specialist to another, he finally came across a doctor who solved the problem.   "The good news is I can cure your headaches... The bad news is that it will require castration. You have a very rare condition which causes your testicles to press up against the base of your spine. The pressure creates one hell of a headache. The only way to relieve the pressure is to remove the testicles."   Joe was shocked and depressed. He wondered if he had anything to live for. He couldn't concentrate long enough to answer, but decided he had no choice but to go under the knife.   When he left the hospital, his mind was clear, but he felt like he was missing an important part of himself. As he walked down the street, he realized that he felt like a different person. He could make a new beginning and live a new life.   He walked past a men's clothing store and thought, "That's what I need: a new suit." He entered the shop and told the salesman, "I'd like a new suit."   The salesman eyed him briefly and said, "Let's see... size 44 long." Joe laughed, "That's right, how did you know?"   "It's my job."   Joe tried on the suit. It fit perfectly. As Joe admired himself in the mirror, the salesman asked, "How about a new shirt?" Joe thought for a moment and then said, "Sure..."   The salesman eyed Joe and said, "Let's see... 34 sleeve and... 16 and a half neck" Joe was surprised, "That's right, how did you know?"   "It's my job."   Joe tried on the shirt, and it fit perfectly. As Joe adjusted the collar i|`|dc046edef00af83c8f3082491c3029adaa	sorry to offend any gays....     2 gay guys are caught in a house fire which one gets out first???   the one receiving coz he already has his sh!t packed

If you feel that any girl that sleeps with you in less than a fixed number of days, is a whore, then you have a major problem, fellow.    I would not think of or call a woman that, even if she slept with me the first night, as long as it happens due to genuine feelings.  If she sleeps with you for some  other reason, like expecting some advantage from you, then she is probably a  whore even if it happens after one year.    The time involved has nothing to do with what it may make her out to be.  The reason she does has everything to do with it.
6180b8284a9d3931fd430d3dd3a57af1aa	Hola !! bueno dejame decirte q uno no debe creer lo que escucha siempre, a mi me parece q ellas jamas han sido lesbianas sino que usaron esto para crearse publicidad, si te das cuenta cuando alguien dice ser gay la gente le presta mas atencion e investiga sobre su vida esto fue mas o menos lo que ella quisieron hacer y lo lograron, por mucho tiempo las personas estuvieron interesadas en saber de su vida y escucharon ademas sus canciones, y el haberse desaparecido por un tiempo es para que las personas trataran de olvidar un poco ese tema para cuando ella volvieran  estuvieran mas interesada en su musica que en lo rumores antes comentados sin embargo a pesar de que ellas dicen no serlo en sus videos actuan como si hubiese entre ellas atraccion mutua, pero como te dije antes esto es justamente para q la gente les preste mas antencion no necesariamente lo hacen porque en realidad sean lesbianas, espero haberte ayudado con mi respuesta.|`|615f57973ed36ca15c729ab379b71835aa	Que van a ser lesbianas esas dos, fue pura estrategia de mercado, de hecho el mismo productor que las sac al mercado intentaba sacar otro grupo pero de hombres gays para llamar la atencin (no confundir con los Backstreet Gays ja ja ja) Saludos|`|66e5b9c3e64731757891167fb2eb833faa	dicen que fue publicidad...tu les crees?|`|35e3020eb133f16ef1352df1d03c7c6aaa	no son lesbianas, lo hacen para calentar nomas...

Now no more!|`|4b5aa5db3a31fef25f048bedf429d3cfaa	he got shot and i didnt read the whole thing cause its freakin me out|`|7192d6ae149dca6cd309588b43ef9ceaaa	No, Tupac is dead, will remain dead and for the record, I'm glad he's dead. His music made me want to gouge my eyes out with a sharp inatimate object.    Oh and just because you label me "gothic" doesn't mean I am a freak. My guess would be that you don't like any of the music I like and if given the chance, you would let me know about it. Just as I did with you. I am just sick of everyone trying to say that tupac is alive and living it up in rome with Elvis or something. The guy got shot, died, and there are autopsy pictures to prove it. The guy made a lot of extra songs that werent on albums just in case they need an album and they have a case of writers block. Almost every artist does it. That is why he had a few songs come out after his demise. The guy is dead. He's not coming back this year. If he would have been coming back, it would have been on 6/6/06 b/c that woud have been hell on earth!   Sorry but when you ask a question like this, suck it up and accept the fact that not everyone is going ape **** over someone who died years ago!  If you can't take the heat, stay out of the kitchen!|`|199e173e92bbaa0fd485a522ac1fca1faa	No. He's dead, not living with Elvis on mars.      Geesh!|`|AA11762234	Nope.

I forget the site, but I do remember a little bit about the story. I'm not even sure if it's true, though. I heard that Paris Hilton went to Nicole Richie's family and told them that Nicole had a drug problem. Nicole then turned it around and said that Paris was the one with the drug problem, and ever since they've been feuding.

Nic was mad and on the night Paris was hosting she put in her Sex video for friends to watch.  It's probably not the real reason but that's what I read.

Oh...I miss new tv.|`|9a8d1ab82c171084bab16072e943bc49aa	lool and ur a guy?|`|701640a77b5589aaae4ee11adc63ca31aa	rori|`|AA10356211	I can't say. TV can be tricky. It may be Lorelai pregnant with Chris' kid and that would only cause a bigger riff in the Luke and Lorelai drama or it could be Lorelai's and they think it is Chris' but it turns out to be Luke's...  I think it would be hard for it to be Rory who gets pregnant because Logan is gone to London for a year and if she dates someone else during the time he is gone, it may be his, or even if it is a one night kind of thing it could be the one nighter's...Although, it would be one of those challenges that characters go through in shows when their significant other is away and the pregnant woman is back home, struggling with school, regular life, etc. while her other half is away from her. That would be good drama and a sort of Chris/Lorelai thing, only Logan would want to be with her while Rory is pregnant (maybe), but he cannot leave London...    Or this could be one of those tricks where they make you think it is one of the actors, but it is actually a townie that gets pregnant.    But maybe it is a trick where they make you think it is the main actors' baby, but then you think it is a townies because it is too obvious to be the main characters', so it must be a townie's, but then that is the trick and it is a main characters' baby.|`|AA12315937	omg i love girlmore girls they are like my total fave sorry i am no prep to be tlking like this but hey i love them especially laurn graham and honestly i think that lorelai will be pregnant seeing as how um... on the season finally of the 6th one she slept with christopher of course it could be sookie with her 3rd child and screw the spoilers and their chitter-chatter rumors!

La sua morte rimane uno degli eventi fondamentali della storia della musica rock. La sua opera e` forse meno saliente, in quanto troppi suoi dischi sono raffazzonati. Hendrix fu uno degli artisti piu` sfruttati dall'industria discografica, che non esito` a pubblicare tutto cio` che Hendrix aveva suonato. Hendrix registro` due grandi album (il primo e il terzo). Ma soprattutto invento` uno stile alla chitarra che era piu` di uno stile: era una dichiarazione di guerra all'armonia occidentale. La chitarra di Hendrix apri` nuove porte alla sperimentazione sullo strumento musicale. La sua lezione sarebbe stata applicata non solo alla chitarra ma anche alle tastiere, a qualunque strumento guidi la melodia nella musica rock. Il caso di Hendrix come chitarrista e` unico nella storia della musica moderna: Hendrix e` sistematicamente in testa a tutti i "poll" di critici del mondo, persino di quelli del jazz. Non esiste la stessa unanimita` per cantanti o batteristi o tastieristi. La sua statura come chitarrista e` paragonabile a quella di Beethoven come sinfonista.   Il suo stile alla chitarra nacque da tre esperienze fondamentali (tutte al di fuori della chitarra rock di Chuck Berry): il rhythm and blues di Chicago (Muddy Waters, Elmore James), il soul di Memphis e l'improvvisazione del chitarrista jazz Charlie Christian. Per quanto Hendrix citasse sia il bluesman Robert Johnson sia Chuck Berry come influenze, e` difficile avvertirle nella sua musica. Semmai sono piu` palesi le influenze di gruppi britannici come Yardbirds, Who e Cream, perlomeno nei primi dischi. E, tecnicamente parlando, Earl Hooker, Johnny Watson e Lowman Pauling furono i primi chitarristi blues a usare certi effetti sonori.     Hendrix fu davvero un grande, straordinario chitarrista, forse il primo grande allo strumento nell'intera storia della musica, certo quello che ne ridefini` il suono. Ma il fenomeno Hendrix fu un abietto e spudorato fenomeno commerciale, non molto piu` nobile di quello di Presley e dei Beatles.     Dal punto di vista strettamente tecnico il suo merito fu quello di aprire nuovi orizzonti alla chitarra elettrica, lo strumento per eccellenza della musica rock. Mancino ed analfabeta, virtuosismo e sperimentazione trovarono in lui il massimo interprete. Nel suo estremismo musicale confluirono elettrificazione, amplificazione e improvvisazione, blues, jazz e rock. La sua tecnica arrivo` ovunque, sfrutto` tutti gli effetti sonori (distorsioni, delay, wah-wah), capace di espandere il suono lungo scale inesplorate. Tutta la mimica della mano, del braccio, persino della bocca, divennero funzionali al far emettere suoni alla chitarra, per piegare le note sotto le torture piu` sadiche agli effetti piu` repellenti (suono` con l'intero palmo della mano, con i denti, con il gomito, persino con l'asta del microfono).     Tutta la tecnologia dello strumento (dal finger-picking al wah-wah, dal plettro ai pedali, dal feedback all'effetto Larsen, dai controlli di tono ai distorsori) divenne una scienza istintiva della timbrica. Cosi` cannibalizzata (e al termine dello show bruciata, condannata al rogo), la sua "sperm-guitar" dava la misura dell'eccesso, quell'eccesso, non come mezzo ma come fine, che "era" la sua arte. Hendrix "invento'" la chitarra elettrica, ne esalto` le potenzialita` tonali e timbriche, usandola in tutti i modi possibili. Con lui la chitarra diventava un'orchestra, una macchina del suono con una gamma pressoche' infinita di possiblita`, fino al limite della parodia della voce umana.     L'improvvisazione partiva dalla scala blues, ma il tema era lasciato libero di espandersi pressoche' all'infinito. Con Hendrix la chitarra acquistava addirittura una psicologia. Il suo magistero piu` alto sta forse nell'inventiva fluente dei suoi assoli e della sua ritmica: esplorare ogni angolo del suono, far vibrare le corde della creativita` in ogni recesso sperduto dell'universo sonoro. Potenziando cosi` le capacita` dialettiche dello strumento, materializzava un ego interiore incontrollabile, i cui deliri si esprimono con una grammatica irrazionale al massimo grado.     E, estendendo il ruolo che essa aveva nel blues, ne fece qualcosa di piu` di uno strumento: un simbolo fallico (simulazioni di amplesso), un urlo di guerra (riti di auto-distruzione), la voce selvaggia delle sensazioni estreme (sensualita` primitiva), uno strumento di rivincita sulla negritudine, un animale ora domestico ora selvatico, un compagno di danza, un amico dotato di pensiero, sentimento e parola, un'appendice al corpo e alla mente. Alla fine di ogni show dava sfogo a un rituale sado-maso di masturbazione e distruzione dello strumento (ovvero di se stesso). Hendrix elevo` quello strumento a simbolo totemico per un'intera generazione.     Hendrix fu soprattutto il re delle adunate oceaniche. Il giovane che aveva bisogno di esorcizzare in qualche modo la civilta' della macchina si identificava nel suo virtuosismo, nella sua padronanza dello strumento, nella sua capacita` di dominare la macchina: Hendrix rappresentava per lui il mito del liberatore, quel tipo di super-uomo che lo sotto-cultura del cinema e dei fumetti stava tramutando in super-eroe. Culto della violenza, della virilita`, della volonta` di potenza: l'eccitazione della massa "costa" al duce l'adesione a filosofie titaniche e nichiliste che condannano automaticamente all'auto-annichilamento. E` un gesto eroico, il sacrificio volontario dell'officiante, secondo un rituale di purificazione ancestrale e in particolare cristiano.     La sua carriera solista si divide in due periodi: uno in cui continua a crescere la sua padronanza dello strumento e Hendrix scopre di giorno in giorno le potenzialita' espressive della chitarra; e uno in cui ha ormai bruciato velocemente tutte le proprie scoperte e non sa piu` cosa fare per colpire, sorprendere, scandalizzare.

AA11999780	A doctor, a lawyer, a little boy and a priest were out for a Sunday afternoon flight on a small private plane. Suddenly, the plane developed engine trouble.    In spite of the best efforts of the pilot, the plane started to go down. Finally, the pilot grabbed a parachute, yelled to the passengers that they had better jump, and bailed out.    Unfortunately, there were only three parachutes remaining.     The doctor grabbed one and said "I'm a doctor, I save lives, so I must live," and jumped out.    The lawyer then said, "I'm a lawyer and lawyers are the smartest people in the world. I deserve to live."     He also grabbed a parachute and jumped.    The priest looked at the little boy and said, "My son, I've lived a long and full life. You are young and have your whole life ahead of you. Take the last parachute and live in peace."    The little boy handed the parachute back to the priest and said, "Not to worry, Father. The 'smartest man in the world' just took off with my back pack."          Things Only Women Understand   10.

The bar tender says, "What would you like, Sir?"  The man says, "I'll have a pint of beer."   He looks at the ostrich and says, "What will you have?"   "I'll have a pint of beer" says the ostrich.   He looks at the cat, "What will you have?"   "Half a pint of beer - but I'm not paying."   "That will be $12.65" says the bartender.

"Double whiskey on the rocks" says the man.   He looks at the ostrich and says "What will you have?"  "I'll join him in a double whiskey" says the ostrich.

We have no life so we play along.    We answer the stupid, we answer the smart,  We answer question after question. How did this all start?    How did we become so addicted? Were did we go wrong?  Now our houses stay dirtywe stopped mowing the lawn!!    We cant sleep at night, we cant concentrate at work  We live to answer questions to people who act like jerks    We stare at our computers till we go nearly blind  But as long as we can give answerswe dont really mind

I think Mariah realizes that Christina can sing better than her and will out do her at anytime. Also Christina is younger and probably will make a better movie than that GLITTER crap Mariah acted in.

AA11031439	What kind of actress are you applying for? TV or Movies or Musical/General Theatre? Depends on what you would decide, but for starter you probably need a manager and an agent that would help you look/book or find you the auditions. Only concern you should have is becareful for scams or fake agency in korea. By the way if you have a pic I'd like to see one. You must be pretty if you are trying out to be actress in Korea.    One more thing, for starters, have some photos taken for portfolio.

fc2bf0c5c18672809868c6f540007fb4aa	I voted for him! As well as win 31 states! And if you want to place blame in anyone's lap try Clinton, Bush has been cleaning up his mess since the day he entered office. If Clinton would have used his oval office for business instead of pleasure he would have listened to the UN and realized Bin Laden was as bad as the Middle East said. And accepted Bin Laden's head on the platter Afghanistan was offering back in 1994!|`|AA11280073	He doesn't represent me. I was smart enough not to vote for him.|`|ce6c618012ebcf6b1e455a22e063a558aa	im not american so i don't like to take sides politically.   but i've lived in a place where there is poverty because of the corrupt government officials... and to tell you the truth, Bush is an angel compared to them. i lived in a country where the president didn't even finish high school and is an alcoholic. he won the votes because he was popular (sad to say, there are too many morons in our country)    i don't know why so many people are so angry with bush. when the 9/11 happened, they were mad at bush for "not doing anything" and now he's doing something (iraq) people are angry at him for doing it. what's it really gonna be? what do they EXACTLY want him to do? if i were bush, i'd be confused myself.|`|0c86b121502c9c03c6a6c8150159a00faa	no, he's a  @$$ hole|`|9c55da970bff6e262331bbb5a5717009aa	He makes the US look bad, that's all I'm gonna say.|`|AA11038398	Dumb" hate to think he does represent the usa I hope we are kinder smarter then he is.|`|AA11096249	Actually, I don't think anything about G.W Bush because everything is obvious like the sun in a summer's day. President Bush is a TERRORIST and BLOOD SHEDDER. My words can't even describe him well but the view can, look at Iraq,Palestine and Lebanon. Oh.....I forgot, President Bush is a big LIAR, he tells Americans lies about fighting terror and spreading democracy. The best prove is what he did in my country Palestine, he just wanted to  upbraid Palestinians for their democratic choise in Palestinians elections. In my opinion Bush represents 60% of the American people.

f5898beed718f00ea073bb88f800f0abaa	hahaha my friends and I are a PRO at getting cameras in. We ALWAYS bring them, it's a must because we meet/hang out with the bands afterwards and we like to have our proof.    If it's small enough, put it at the bottom of your purse, if anyone you know wears pads, take one and put that on TOP of the camera, put paper and your money on top of that ... add in there anything else you need [keys, compact, lip gloss, lotion etc] but be sure they don't jiggle your purse too hard or they will see it. Pockets is a HUGE thing NOT to do because most places search you, with a wand and/or their hands so they WILL feel it if it's in a pocket. If the camera is small enough and you can put it in your bra, I advise if you do that, when the wand beeps tell them it's the underwire to your bra.    Most places will take it, and it's up to them if they want to give it back at the end of the show or not. If you're that worried by a zoom disposable camera, it works just as well.    Good luck and have a blast at your show!|`|d181de7334d88f05287f1ba688c37fc9aa	they took your cameras or mad eyou take them to the car when i went to dashboard at verizon in houston.    so ya.    but you can have camera phones.|`|0d9ca2bcc57467d4a23dc6b0d5b53fc5aa	Most concerts will let you bring in a disposible or digital camera.|`|AA11686559	I'd bring a disposable in case it gets taken away.

They send back photos with their names stamped on them...not real signatures because they are afraid people will see all that on E-Bay.  So if you really get a response from your idol, be happy, because more often then not they don't respond these days, and so it's worth the wait.  But if you can get to know someone who has inside connections, well, that would be the only way to get a faster response.

AA11440193	It is a popular rich, sweet pastry found in many cuisines of the Middle East, South Asia, and the Balkans, which are made of chopped nuts layered with phyllo pastry, sweetened with sugar or honey syrup.    And it would still taste like baklava regardless of it's shape.    Ingredients you will need:     1. 1 lb Walnuts - Finely Chopped   2. 1/2 C. Sugar   3. 2 tsp Cinnamon   4. 1.5 C. Butter (3 sticks), Melted   5. 1 Package Frozen Phyllo Dough (16 oz) Thawed   6. 1 C. Sugar   7. 1 C. Water   8. 1 Tbsp Lemon Juice   9. 1 C. Honey (Net weight 12 oz.)   10. 1/2 tsp Vanilla      The steps:     1. Preheat the oven to 300 degrees.   2. Combine and set aside walnuts, 1/2 cup sugar, and cinnamon   3. Using a pastry brush, lightly brush the bottom and sides of a Jelly Roll Pan (15.5" x 10.5" x 1") with melted butter.   4. Open the phyllo dough and layer 6 whole leafs (or 12 half leafs) in the pan, buttering each layer as you go. (The edges will extend over the side.)   5. Spread 1 cup of the walnut mixture.   6. Cut the remaining phyllo dough in half.   7. Layer 8 half sheets -- butter each layer. Each sheet will be an inch or so short, so stagger the sheets from corner to corner to cover the whole pan. I use a pattern so I don't forget how many layers I've put down, but it's even easier if you have a friend help!   8. Spread 1 cup of the walnut mixture.   9. Repeat 8 sheets and walnut mixture twice. You will end up with 4 layers of nuts.   10. Layer the remaining half sheets on top -- butter each layer.   11. Brush the top with the remaining butter.   12. Trim the edges off.   13. Cut halfway through the layers.  Cut diagonal from side to side, then cut straight across the pan. (Note: Do NOT cut from corner to corner.) This is done now since it will be very fragile after it's been baked.  14. Bake 1 hour or until golden brown.   15. 15 minutes before the baklava should be done, mix 1 cup sugar, water, and lemon juice in a sauce pan.   16. Cook sauce over a medium heat, stirring occasionally for 15 minutes.   17. Remove from heat, add the honey and vanilla, and stir until well blended.   18. Remove the baklava from the oven and finish cutting through the layers.   19. Pour the sauce over the hot baklava.   20. Cool. Let it sit for at least 24 hours (lightly covered -- but not in the refrigerator) -- longer if you can stand it!     A nice way to serve individual pieces is to put each one into a muffin cup that has been partially flattened.|`|AA11253145	like baklava-it is baklava no matter what shape you put it in.    Baklava is a Greek pastry.  It is made with Phyllo dough, nuts, butter and honey with some spices thrown in.

AA12028206	The problem is not in you... somehow i have seen that christians are the only ones who react to any comments on God, where they are the one asking for it all the time. For them their belief is the only thing that matters in the world, if someone doesnt agree to them then those will go to hell... all that crap. If anyone doesnt like it, they should not be posting their questions of God on here.    So you go where you want, do what you want, say what you want... free speach is our birth right.|`|6beca5d8773cb63f9c8f8231554faf70aa	uhhhh.. wtf .. lol just think better next time.. make the joke funny|`|104df3e3384718f89fad5b2e1fe42040aa	JUS MAKE JOKES WHOM EVER IT MAY BE ON|`|632aebb081351317aaf80f17efbca6c2aa	No, Christians deserve humour as much as anyone else.

b24030d585fb8a31b034cedc0f13d3d3aa	I like your attitude. So... when ya' inventing that engine that runs on water?    "Every generation has a defining moment This was ours." is just the tagline for a movie. Which generation would an event like that define? Yours or mine?     People could say the Vietnam war defined my generation but SO much more has happened in my lifetime than that war. I saw the invention of color TVs, microwaves, VCRs, DVDs, personal computers, the end of smallpox, man walking on the moon and many wars. There are too many brilliant, innovative, defining moments in my lifetime to pick one.    No one incident defines ANY generation. It's just a movie tagline.|`|49f8145ed58d5bf5b6d79c1a6f12ab42aa	none of the people that hijacked the planes were from iraq. so why are we fighting in iraq? good effin question. i don't really think this is going to answer your question but you said something about war and it made me think of this. whenever i hear the words 9/11 and the war in iraq in the same sentence, i get so pissed off. this war is fricken illegal and we had no reason to start it in the first place. bush needs to be impeached and we need a new president. think about it, we're over there repairing what we destroyed. does that make any sence? whats worse, screwing an intern or screwing the country?|`|AA11385862	its a movie, get over it!|`|bf9494950765e7157be26b6e6912e2a0aa	Do something about it ...|`|d4d64eedaf011936a0e376e304ffe69eaa	I agree with you, but it is what it is and our grandchidren are going to ask us about it someday.|`|AA11540395	I'm furious about the movie- not because I want a better 'defining moment', but because I am horrified that the tragedy of 9/11 was turned into a profit-making movie. Real people died, real people were hurt, real lives were ruined- it's not an event that should be turned into a theatrical event. It should be remembered, but not as a movie- it needs to be remembered as a tragedy, as a horrifying act of terrorism that we can never allow to happen again.   I am insulted and angered by the movie that has been released, and I most definitely not be watching it at any point.|`|7d2fc69bb3b31a1fbb42a766647997d1aa	I understand your point.  I haven't seen the movie, so I'm not sure what will be portrayed in it, except those 2 guys surviving.  But I think what the movie is trying to say is that we Americans proved that we have an undying spirit and that when needed, we pull together and help each other no matter what.  I agree that the effort to help is long gone, but the memories aren't, so maybe they're trying to remind people of that.    It's a good story of triumph, though, I mean, those 2 survived against all odds, you know?  That's pretty awesome!  :  )|`|AA11400994	I'm still a bit sensitive about 9/11. I definately think that a movie being made about one person is selfish. Becasue many many people died on that terrible day.|`|b660e46b2945c7f6fd219e46e845e477aa	I agree. Why does it always have to be something bad that gives a generation a defining moment? Why can't it be a moment that everyone benefited from?|`|13cc924496bd142f922c04208cc34143aa	Our defining moment was The Lion King!

If you want songs/music, click the audio tab. doing this changes the type in box. now just fill in the correct info for title or artist (dont do anything elso cause it doesnt help). since the search is dependent on who is online, you may not find any one to download from.     also, if the song is from a not well known band, it may also not be found. finally, some downloads are trick links to another source. keep clicking till you find one that works.

When you were searching for that artist, it may not have been.  Having said that, it does not mean the artist is not attainable.   You may also need to check that the artist's name or the song, is spelt  or written correctly.    What I do is to nominate the song, or the year, or the genre and try a search from there.   Check out the various options on the left side of your screen.  Work from there.

62df3239f5809bb4f76bab5956c951ddaa	They are definetly pretty cool. They've got alot of funny tunes. My favorite lyric of their's is probably- I signed a million doller contract/ And I puked on every page/ Slaughtered half the crew/ Because they ate my deli tray/ Oh baby please/ I said I'd do the show/ But I canceled anyway/ You were road kill baby/Until I scraped you in my arms     and so on and so on from the song 'The Road Behind'. The song sounds all romantic, but it has such a sarcastic lyric to it but in a real funny way. It's definetly cool...|`|AA11370084	oh gwar....lol, quite fun.  not to mention they are the best thing for grocery stores that have extra meat that needs to get sold when they come to your town. :)|`|AA11003644	Hell yes!!!!|`|1e0df759b3ad05a0af35bfa690a9cff7aa	not really sounds a bit rediculous. unless its an abreviation for someting|`|00d0e91b1027838b81f3c73d38803f53aa	Never heard of it.|`|AA10556781	Yes! Gwar are talented and funny. I've seen them live several times, there's nothing like it. One of my favorite things is rock musician's that don't take themselves too seriously. And any band that successfully makes their own little world (like DEVO) has done something right. Gwar are SO entertaining, you get rocking band with good musicians, comedy, and a pioneering live show which no band has ever equaled.|`|f9a3e1c128fc8db471557f621af0a969aa	F@ K  YEA THEY ROCK!!!!!!!|`|AA12059293	In a gay sort of way, yes. But the thing that's irritating about them is it's all shock value, musically it's just average.|`|cbb5677bf733a87639a396b7e1a8805daa	HELL YEA! they rock!
AA11370084	the beats are not very exciting or inspiring    it sounds like the words are either being read off a piece of paper or   the person singing them has just memorized them right before recording, a little too much mumbling as well for my taste.    and that reverb effect at the start of intermission has got to go.    the recording quality isn't all that great, but i assume its been done in a home studio of sorts, so i'll overlook it.  for the record though you can get pretty good quality out of a home studio set up but controling the sound bleeding around can be rather difficult.      i'm also not sure if it has to do with fact that its streaming or not, but the bass is rather muddy sounding (and i'm playing it through a  1500 watt pa system so my speaker setup isn't too blame for this)  i've run into this before where something has sounded fine in my home but in car or normal stereo systems its just messy sounding.  but this could be the fact that its streaming perhaps so you will just have to decide based on the original.    my biggest suggestion goes along with the singing thing i mentioned before, the delivery just doesn't sound all that good and feels like its dragging.    anyway, keep at it.  it can only get better and better and making music is just too much fun to ever stop just because some people don't like this or that that you might be doing.  first and most important is that you like it and enjoy it.  make what you want to hear and eventually an audience will come around.|`|b3dead82e1d2cffd37c5606e5d90db6caa	well I'm more into hard rock myself but hey just keep on practicing even the top musicians had to start somewhere|`|a7699410db2ad94ca079d5f09649104baa	you suck.   but thanks for asking so i could answer and get my 2points.|`|0bfef8002f1af8203bb7b53615ba2313aa	Too many group members. Seems like you were recruting and just did not have the guts to tell some ppl no. If this is not the case, make better records-  1-improve the beats.  2-Actually write the lyrics  3-Do not talk only about what the rappers out right now do-Money, hoes, material possessions, etc, BE CREATIVE. And do not rap about a stupid dance thatyou created. DFB got lucky and D4L are just plain old faggots.     Hope this helps! :)

AA10252579	Could be, but I think it's because you are just a little kinky.|`|AA11128712	Probably not.  There doesn't seem to be any direct correlation between childhood spankings - or the lack of them - and a taste for for being spanked when you're an adult.  Some of us, I reckon, are just hard-wired into this particular kink.    So go ahead and enjoy!  Though if you feel you missed out, you might try playing daddy/daughter (or mommy/daughter) games with your spanking partner.|`|34e7658531fab6f183acd068836c2d77aa	No.  If anything, I think it would be logical for people who do enjoy being spanked to somehow relive that mixture of feelings from when they were little.|`|93c2e96781ef969823f0ca75ea06dd09aa	YEP - Crazy.|`|AA12062760	There is nothing wrong with wanting to be spanked.

8ef0f842c44f7c4faa964afe4d9b4ee2aa	I had to move because of hurricane Katrina. Our house was declared uninhabitable. I lived in Pascagoula, MS and moved about 10 miles away into a house that didnt get any water. My parents are in a Fema trailer and are doing fairly well. For some reason, we got assistance a lot faster than the people in New Orleans did. My parents got their trailer in about a month and Ive heard people in N.O. waited far longer than that. So, I am mostly satisfied with the wat things went here but watching N.O. on t.v. I think they were far too slow getting water, food, and supplies to the people in the convention center. It was all really hard for everybody and Im glad things are getting back to a new kind of normal.Thanks for your prayers!!!|`|53255a36871d04360236976491cdab04aa	Sorry I'm not a hurricane Katrina victim but I got to know some of them because they moved to my city they are taking it one day at a time I think most of them are very lucky to still be alive, I'm glad that they got away safe but i do feel deeply sorry for the others who didn't and their families. On the news there was a man to get the attention of President Bush by bringing one of the trailers to Washington to get President Bush to realize it has been a year but Hurricane Katrina victims or still suffering and there is still a lot of work to be done. The man lost his job and home, I think President Bush should have already realized there was still trouble with out him coming there. I hope that hurricane season won't be that bad this year and that everybody is somewhat prepared but I don't think anybody could have been that prepared for what happened.     The Hurricane Katrina victims will always be in my prayers.

AA12166503	He wasn't there long at all, Yoda didn't want him to leave because his training wasn't finished and  the dark side was using his friends to flush him out. By doing this, they stood a better chance of defeating him since he would not be as strong in the force.      This is what the Star Wars databank says...     On the swamp planet of Dagobah, Luke learned the ways of the Force from Yoda the Jedi Master. Yoda honed Luke's Jedi abilities, but his training was cut short as Luke had to go rescue his friends on Bespin. Little did Luke know that it was all an elaborate trap devised by Darth Vader.|`|dd57c7f883d7e69cc7906fc46e54207baa	Not on Dagobah long enough he was......further training he needed, yes!|`|49f3ed52ec18c0c15ecf96319c55c655aa	Only a few weeks at the most.    Which is why those movies don't make any kind of sense whatsoever.    Obi and Anakin were trained Jedi masters and knights respectively with years of experience under their belt.    Luke comes in, and in a few short weeks, stands toe-to-toe with Vader? Am I missing something here?    That was just as stupid as when the writers punked Darth Maul by having Obi kill him so easily.|`|1e08d9487ecc4ecacb9892c6afe5f3c7aa	He was there for 698 years.|`|AA11421015	he might have been there just a few days.    There is one thing i know.  By Star Wars Story, the entire Ep 4-6 was 4 years time (of story line) so in that time he went from a farm boy, to a aprentice, to a student, to a jedi knight,  and by the end of Jedi, he was pretty much the best.|`|a0154e79bc08776f43c052f5abe131b4aa	He was on Dagobah in "Empire" for a very short time yes.  Remember, he left his training when he had the vision of Han, Leia and the others in pain and suffering.  So he left against Yoda's advice.  He returned sometime after Han was turned into a carbonite-sicle and completed his training *remember he was a full fledged Jedi when Threepio and R2 went to see Jabba the Hutt|`|AA11080382	Maybe he's a quick study. He learned how to fly an X-Wing in about a week, apparently.|`|3f21cefde94e0247d84925d21799fdd3aa	Ok for one, Luke learned how to fly his x-wing after weeks, because he had all that time to train while the Death Star was traveling in hypers space to reach the Rebel base. Traveling in Hyper space takes weeks, even months.    He spent some time in Dagobah, maybe a few weeks with Yoda, but that doesn't mean he kept trainining by himself. he didn't need yoda to train, so by the time he was at Return of the Jedi, he had self trainned himself quite  alot, and he also had the advantage of becoming a Jedi faster than Obi Wan since he was the son of the chosen one...|`|fb6673ae4d70f1126e72b638e1f9511caa	Luke was probably there a couple weeks,but i see a complaint that he didn't train long enough to use the force. Remember anakin didn't train as a jedi and knew how to fly a podracer. Just because he wasn't trained, didn't mean he wasn't strong in the force. It just meant he didn't know how to control it yet, which is why Yoda worried when he left too early. Luke had the force with him, but as Vader said, he was not a jedi yet.

79a1a0539e6e2ced6168d198fccde5bdaa	It has been said that men think about sex every 30 seconds, and each thought lasts 45 seconds.    Men can more easily have sex with no emotional attachment than women can.  Many women equate sex with love.  Women can get pregnant, thus they have a possible consequence of their action that a man doesn't have (and a lot of the time doesn't think of).     Us women know you guys want it, and as my husband has said many times, "a woman has 100% control, because they have control of the p****"|`|d792b2b7c2c0f35abda9b1c7cf79b19eaa	Yes, but women want sex too.|`|7c0351d2dbdaf44778d03cc3fc1a579baa	Oh they know it!|`|AA11124885	We know but if you're not the right guy we just don't care.

AA11121783	O.K.  I took Flamenco from Juan Serrano for many years and he has quite a few books out for begginer and intermediate and advanced students.  I can't spell them but some good ones are Malequania,  Sevillanas, tempestad, and actually a lot of others.  Go to a music store and find his book Juan Serrano Flamenco.  It will help you play good spanish songs and teach you how to do them with the rasquiado technique which is essential to good spanish music.  It will also help as I believe it is written in both chord and tab form  good luck and have fun

b512b9546e9f3497b2ad37cdfb5e7134aa	Yes I saw it, and i loved it, if you like Almodovar's films you'll probably like this one too. However there are some pretty controversial story lines in this film that include drug use, homosexuality, pedophilia,  as well as a somewhat graphic sex scene between a trans gender woman and a man, so if you are on the conservative side or are sensitive to this sort of thing I would suggest you skip it because you are probably not going to enjoy it. Needless to say it is not appropriate for children or maybe even adolescents.   Other that that the story is carefully constructed and the acting is superb, it will keep you guessing all the way to the end.|`|2b7ef4fd614f67995249a369328fc597aa	if you mean "mala education" no but pretty safe to say anything I've seen with Gael Garcia Bernal is a quality movie.
5d0cbb6410a43575123a724278183e9caa	First showing sold out. Received a well deserved round of applause & standing O--lead by an elementary school kid. Incredible movie. Awesome hero. Great boxing scenes, gorgeous cinematography , funny jokes. Realistic & entertaining. (How often do you get that?) Good soundtrack. So surprised did not see a wider release or shown at bigger festivals. (Keep hope alive.) Anyone who thinks this is a niche film did not watch it. It is a people movie. It should have at least followed Smoke Signals' steps. I am sure it will have a cult following once on DVD. Everyone who is a part of this movie should be so proud of what they have achieved. Cannot be articulated.

He seems genuine.  I hope he wins.  I wouldn't mind if Yul wins, but I would be happier with Ozzy winning.  I have a hunch Yul will win because he still hasn't played his immunity necklace.    If Jonathan wins, I will be so pissed off.  He has betrayed everyone in the game.|`|f7e1f090766130c237dc9f5ffbbe611caa	Although i totally hate him....jonathan. He has screwed everyone and I think that Yul is going to take him to the final two just so he can win against him. which means he is going to go against his word with Becky and everyone else.  He has already said as much to Jonathan. If i were on the jury i would vote for him just as everyone did on the first season against Jenna for Richard. Personally tho i would like to see Ozzy win because he has been a survivor and he provided the rest of his team with food.....Nate was my second favorite.

9d1b1b7795de88f60447f031f1342f3faa	I was surprised by how much I liked it.  It was pretty predictable though, I was a bit reminded of The English Patient (which sucked) for some reason, and I wish, as a man, that Jessica Alba hadn't used a body double, but yeah, pretty good.|`|5d0cbb6410a43575123a724278183e9caa	The Sleeping Dictionary should be noted mostly for being the biggest missed opportunity of shooting star Jessica Alba. This film was her only film project between the first and second seasons of "Dark Angel,' the show that turned her into a sensation, but quickly died a network death at the end of season 2, and thus ending the heat index on the lovely Miss Alba. The tragedy is this film, a good showcase of her and her abilities (rather than just her), was inexplicably delayed, pushed off and kept from theater screens, only to be released direct-to video far too long after her star dimmed.    As with any product here, you can get the synopsis elsewhere, so don't look for it here. I'll try not to spoil anything, but take note if you read this, then watch the movie, you may get tipped off as to what I'm vaguely referencing. If that bothers you, come back after you watch!    This is a film that had a good idea, and good execution of what the idea turned into. Unfortunately, a little bit more planning would have helped. At 109 minutes, this film won't bore you, but it could have been rightfully intriguing with 20-30 minutes of good plot added.    The film is carried on the sound filmmaking and charm of it's actors. In particular, Alba is enchanting. She plays the part with the seriousness it was intended, and never lets her intentionally accented English fall into 'stupid foreigner' stereotype, a tough job for many young actors and actresses who have attempted the same. Her partner, Hugh Dancy, is good enough. He channels a little bit like a scrawny Heath Ledger, but never quite gets rugged enough.    The other joy of the cast is the ever-underrated Bob Hoskins. By coincidence, I saw 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit' just hours before watching 'Sleeping Dictionary,' and am never let down by his appearances in films. He plays a character who isn't written subtly enough; still, he acts it. The endless looks of "Damn bloody fool. Good for him, the w***er" scattered through the film isn't enough for a man of his caliber, but we'll take what we can get.    Their performances are weaved together well by Writer/Director Guy Jenkin, who is making his big screen debut as a director, though his writing career goes back to the late '70's without much acclaim. Directing-wise, he knows what he is doing. The camera work is graceful and beautiful, and he compliments the fantastic elements of the story well. As a writer, well, there are things left to be desired.    Most of all, this film seems too short. The story is predictable, but it never drags. The love scenes are contrived, as is the underdeveloped climax, but that's not where the film is weak. The characters are cleverly set up to be mirrors, and the overlapping triangles are so complex they rival those brainteasers that ask 'how many triangles are in this picture?' The problem is, the most important one is never realized, because of the lack of development between Dancy and his best friend within the tribe. Without much difficulty, and a little more time, that relationship alone would have lifted this film from not quite enough to a good, if not better, movie.    As a result, you're left with a film that doesn't challenge anything because it just challenges the same old things. But it is romantic, and has much more spark than many other movies you may see of this type. For that, and a young actress who has way too much fire to just disappear at this point of her career, this film is worth seeing.

ee6218822973054d5d01e2125619ddb7aa	Talk radio stations need critics to do shows reviewing popular new movies and restaurants.  Newspapers, magazines, and journals need them to write review columns as well.  Some TV shows have critics review things as well, but that is more uncommon than the previous possiblities.  Sometimes online magazines, journals, or blogs might have someone do reviews, but most of these would be small independent parties and wouldn't provide much of an income or popularity.    The most probable source would be written media such as magazines and journals.  Pretty much every health or popular interest magazine has a section with reviews.

I've seen Les Pauls that have been modified in that way.|`|AA10599118	I DUNNO|`|bf6805035361b5327f28de33733a405aaa	It's definitely possible, but you might not want to have a local guitar shop try to do it. See if you can find a luthier in your area who has a lot of experience with building electric guitars, they should be able to do a beautiful job.
568969d23edabcbc9b94de9177dfeedfaa	Weird Al does that all the time. He takes the original music to a song, like say Beat It by Micheal Jackson and changes the lyrics to Eat it.He does parodies of songs all the time. As for say writing an original song to someone else's beat, it would probably be harder to do. That and if you want to record the song, you'd have to get permission from the original artist and songwriter before you do it.|`|26156474ed8f802691b915239e24da09aa	Hip-Hop does it all the time.  The only problem you would have is if it was recorded and sold.  Then you have to pay royalities.|`|AA11216016	a lot of rappers do it... just look at that one White & Nerdy guy lol (Weird Al)|`|a187a31a5294010e2710e7ff20dfcb78aa	Yeah,but you can't use it if you trying to start a business.If you keep it to yourself!Because that is against the law!You can go to jail!!|`|8c2e31b181af7bc2248866a17d771bbeaa	no that is sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo... copying|`|308d0c666423323caa40cf8938f8a39faa	You can do that, but it's plagiarism. (Which is a felony in most states). Your song wouldn't be original if you used someone else's beat, anyway.   Remember when Vanilla Ice took the beat from Bowie/Queen's "Under Pressure", and marketed it as his original work? That's exactly what you're trying to do.    Shame.

It says when you click on the show, watch full episode or get a 2 minute preview or something like that and you click on the full episode one and you can watch it. It just gives you like more than one part of the show so it's not all on one video, it's in multiple ones. |`|3ecdb8e121c3c283ac9afb6c436f6788aa	I've been watching it each week on nbc.com & have had no problems, if you will click on watch full episode wait a few after the end of the 1st one, it is broken down into different episodes and will have to watch a commercial or two but should come back on with the next one.

Nel febbraio del 2000 si unisce al gruppo Michelle Williams.

Aprender msica no implica saber tocar algunos acordes de alguna cancin conocida. Implica horas y horas de estudio, teria, composicin, prctica, etc. etc., lo cual es conveniente realizar con alguien que tenga verdadero conocimiento / experiencia en el tema, ya sea a travs de un profesor, un conservatorio o instituto si uno lo quiere hacer bien. Sino pods tomarlo como un hobbie y si tens capacidad podrs sacar algunas cosas e incluso progresar dentro de un nivel.

En la msica, si no tens oido y/o ritmo...ests perdido. Por ms que estudies a?os y a?os.  Hay un oido que se entrena, para descifrar intervalos entre notas u otro tipo de cuestiones como la tonalidad y otras cuestiones.  Pero hay un oido con el que se "nace", y es el que te facilitar las cosas. Y no hay vuelta atrs con esto.    Hay gente que tiene oido, y otra que lamentablemente no puede ni entonar UNA nota mientras la canta encima de un tema.  Hay una cuestin de coordinacion de los miembros que tens que tener (ojo, se entrena tambin, pero ciertas cosas ya vienen con uno)    Hay una mezcla de las dos cosas. Siendo autodidacta, vas a llegar un momento que tocaste tu techo, AH es donde tiene que encontrar un "maestro" que te guie para ampliarlo..    Exitos con eso!!    PD: Mozart NO fue autodidacta. Tuvo a su padre Leopold como maestro desde los 3 a?os......a los 6 compuso su primera sinfona. Y fue tenendo distintos maestros. Haendel, Johan Cristian Bach (hijo de Johan Sebastian Bach) y otros ms..  Mozart fue una persona que naci con TODOS los oidos y TODAS las aptitudes del mundo.....un irrepetible.  En las escrituras de sus obras, casi no habia tachaduras.  En cambio Beethoven, tena multitudes de tachaduras, y le costaba muchsimo ms que a Mozart. Tanto que a veces cambiaba partes completas...

Actualmente estoy con Dream Theater, Liquid Tensin Experiment, Gordian Knot y Planet X.

If you give up, then it's never gonna happen! The worst thing that can happen is that you don't make it big-but, if you really love music, then it wasn't a waste of your time, because you spent it doing something that you loved!|`|05a2de2fad25308c9051fbf79fe6d06caa	Average people do not become stars.  Stars often work for years and are dedicated to their instrument.  A year is relatively nothing for professional musicians unless you were playing almost constantly, which you werent.  If you are serious drop the poor poor pitiful me stuff, suck it up and start practicing without breaks of a couple of weeks.  This is WORK.|`|25b36c533f34e7ed3be2b2913c6c7df2aa	At your rate,never.

Cris Wall.|`|AA11059938	To become a good player you must not only play well but understand music theory as it is applied to certain elements such as chords, scales, arpeggios, and harmony. This all lies within the realm of music theory which you should also put into your practice for this expands your music knowledge and when you listen to your favorite players, you will understand better what it is they do and why they do it that way. Don't try to get too discouraged if music is what you love. Nothing comes overnight and you can be just as good or better than many others. It's all a process.|`|fe75cd22b2a0e9b5228115fde4dc4936aa	I think it depends on how often you play and what kind of music you play - so long as you practice, you'll get good, but there's no timeline. If you read about really great musicians, the time they spent practicing varies from 1 to like, 10+ years before they started playing shows and stuff. Just keep playing, always push yourself and try new stuff to learn new techniques, and you'll be rocking out in no time.

It starred Steve Frost and Mark Arden and was shown during the 90's so it's possible your friends are actually remembering that ad instead.    It ended with the two 'Oblivion Boys' saying the immortal line 'I bet he drinks Carling Black Label', then as the camera pans away to reveal that they stripped completely (modesty protected by newspapers) they say 'nah', cos Kamen kept his boxers on.    Incidently it wasn't just the sales of Levi's that went through the roof, the ad was credited with bringing boxer shorts back to popularity, and Marvin Gaye's I heard it through the Grapevine back into the charts.|`|f42ee32c6b4b47478d2fe02da1fd750eaa	yes.  think it was about 1985?|`|e49a5d42e67d7a51a8555fc7fc3a5209aa	All i can say is Phwah!!!!|`|261acc6eb4f0e0c39b9f7ba984093fe5aa	He is most famous for his 1985 beefcake performance in Levi's "Launderette" TV commercial where he strips down in order to stone-wash his blue jeans in a 1950s style public laundromat while he waits clad only in his boxer shorts, which dramatically increasing their popularity.

Then you can add them from the CD  And Don't use Limewire unless you like virus's|`|AA12155834	There are quiet a few ways to get music off the Internet. I won't go into the legalities of all of them. Obviously, if you are getting someones copyrighted material without paying, then that's probably not legal.     There are services that you can use to get music that WILL pay the artists who created the songs. The most popular are probably...    Apple iTunes -> http://www.itunes.com  Napster -> http://www.napster.com  and even WalMart -> http://www.walmart.com/swap/SwapEntry.do...    All of these services will sell you songs between .85 and $1.00 per song or so.    There are quite a few services advertised on Clickbank that make the promise that for a one time membership fee, you can download an unlimited number of songs. Here are those services. I cannot attest to how well they work, so research them by visiting them...    Unlimited Download Center -> http://watersaffl.udc01.hop.clickbank.ne...  Movie Downloads.com -> http://watersaffl.movies01.hop.clickbank...  Unlimited MP3 Music -> http://watersaffl.gamecity.hop.clickbank...  Hot MP3 Downloads -> http://watersaffl.mp3hot.hop.clickbank.n...    I have had good luck finding music on BitTorrent sites. BitTorrent is an Internet protocol for moving very large files. It's not the same as P2P (limewire and such), but it relies on other users in the BitTorrent community leaving their music files available. I have often been frustrated by downloading a song or album only to find that after it downloads 95%, it stops because not enough BitTorrent seeders have kept the files available. The upside to BitTorrents are that they download extremely fast!     You'll need a BitTorrent client to download torrents. I use Azureus. It's a free and very nice client application that you can get here...  http://azureus.sourceforge.net/      You'll also need a few BitTorrent tracker sites. Here are a few to get you started...  TorrentSpy -> http://www.torrentspy.com/  The Pirates Bay -> http://thepiratebay.org/  ISO Hunt -> http://isohunt.com/  MiniNova -> http://www.mininova.org    Finally, I have had great luck finding unknown artists by using an NNTP News Server. NNTP is an old Bulletin Board type of protocol. NNTP means Network News Transport Protocol. But the NNTP community has evolved into about 50,000 different 'channels' that cover every imaginable subject and there is a way to 'encode' binary files to place them on these NNTP groups. For music, music is grouped into different 'genres'. For example, I download Jazz and Reggae from two different channels. It is not easy to find any particular song or artist, so I just download everything in a group and often find songs and artists that I've never heard of before.    To download music from NNTP groups, you'll need a News Reader. There are some free ones out there. I use this one...  http://www.newsbinpro.com/    Well, that ought to keep you busy for a while! Good luck!|`|7f7681e1f3f12bab193501e7a7bcb046aa	The problem is that the music that's bought off of Musicmatch, and off of Itunes are in two different formats, and neither of them are normally compatible with each other. Before you can play or add a Musicmatch track on Itunes, you'll have to convert it(I found this site - http://www.soundtaxi.info/ - which has a program that'll convert protected WMA and AAC files.)

38cb4675dca9d9f6567d3c16f345ad79aa	It is very interesting because today I had choir and we saw this video about vocal helalth fron the the Kansas Vocal Health Center. And it showed videos of the movements of the vocal cords in healthy vocal cords, and videos of other people that had nodes,callusses on the vocal cords, and larengitus, cancer,etc. It was so wierd and slightly gross.    But to answer your question i would say just to lay low on the singing or talking, vocal rest, because the body is telling you something if your vocal cords will not move the way they usally do, wierd phraseing, sorry. And get lots of water and fruits and veggies, or see a doctor if it doesn't go away in a week or two.    I hope you get well soon! :)|`|AA11584298	Maybe you could work on your rendition of " ( Silent ) Night " while you're waiting for your voice to come back.|`|AA11020911	You should gargle salt water.

I really like Hatake Kakashi and Maito Gai as well because of their incredible prowess and because they're pretty funny together.  We all know that Kakashi pwns, but even though Gai is pretty eccentric, he's a force to be reckoned with, even to the point that Itachi considers him a threat.  And well, Kakashi became a full-fledged Jounin even before he acquired the Sharingan and he created his own signature move despite being the "copy ninja", which is a testament to his power.|`|74df06eada44dda1210eb110379d423aaa	mine is Shikamaru|`|AA11286873	I like Kakashi Hatake, Shikamaru, Sakura, Ino, Sasuke (before he turns to Orochimaru), and perhaps Naruto in a   certain moment, also Sai.|`|e69bfb1d4e916838c66696385c12d8f6aa	first i need to say that sasuke is a gerk an dhe will try to kill naruto.( oh and he's emo) anyways, my favorite caracter is well.... i'm not exactly sure who's my favorite caracter, so i guess kakashi might be my favorite caracter.|`|AA10393843	Ughhh...such a tough question >_ ^_^|`|AA12298356	ohhhhh yeah!!!! thats my fave show Sasuke is definitely my favorite character :)|`|e9f6ace9b69e0ec9b91467e8628761a8aa	I like Shikimaru, Baki, Itachi Uchiha, and Neji.|`|8841748c1856e3f2bf7849f063f5fb27aa	My fav charater is that one girl who likes Naruto|`|8ee73aa86d10055db7fb3d9d1c41e82faa	I agree Sasuke is my fav character 2!

Las nuevas generaciones conoceran mas temas de Queen que de los Beatles.

AA11623402	Look at song  3. About halfway through it. It is part of the track "The Steward of Gondor" in the Return of the King album. Merry and pippin sing a song in the Fellowship of the Ring but it is only on the movie version.|`|4585afb8ecfdaef590b604938257fc53aa	I think that's because you have the wrong singer name.    Pippin sings a song in the "Steward of Gondor" track. The song is called 'Edge of Night'    You can listen to it here: http://www.arwen-undomiel.com/music.html    Actaully...i'm not sure if its called edge of night...i think you can mp3 download it here: http://sharedmusic.net/search/Ford|`|aacfab3c3d26a1649b0783346465d2e8aa	Why don't you look for a sound track for the Return of the King and see if it's listed on there? I know you won't know which one is THAT song probably if any of them, but it's a place to start.    Or try typing in some of the lyrics on google?|`|9417a9f0c898a60b7dce8d34152a60d1aa	I don't recall Merry singing a song, so I assume you are referring to Pippin. It is part of the track "The Steward of Gondor" in the Return of the King album, and the lyrics are as follows.    Home is behind,  The World ahead,  And there are many paths to tread,  Through shadow,   To the edge of night,  Until the stars are all alight,   Mist and shadow,  Cloud and shade,  All shall fade,  All shall fade.    It was originally a poem in the Fellowship of the Ring written by J.R.R. Tolkien, but was turned into a song by Billy Boyd for the movie.

The Lord of the Rings in are good movies, Star Wars is a  much better movie. Star Wars does end. Obi Wan does not die or get hurt at all. Anakin is the one who catches on fire, but does not die. Watch the movies in order the newer ones first and the movies make perfect sense.|`|d7d272087e4bfe9af5235921d62eb241aa	obbie one didnt get set on fire anikan did he survive obbie left the plannet alive and in one peice. and although star wars is one of te best movies ever i agree lotor is far better oh and dude youseriously need to work on ur english
