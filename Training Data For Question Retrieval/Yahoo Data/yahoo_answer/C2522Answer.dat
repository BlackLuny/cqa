If the plugs haven't been changed in the past three years, inspect, check the gaps and replace if necessary.|`|zOIgzIy4aa	it,s possible but very unlikely snow would get on the plug and wires. probably you have a bad plug wire.|`|EmgiGg17aa	Could be faulty spark plug, bad ignition wires or salt water from the roads.  I woould look at the first two first....and maybe a tune up.  Water itself does not cause a problem (otherwise all cars would die in the rain) but salt water does conduct a current.  But if the wires are on tight and are not touching any metal anywhere this should not be a problem.       Tune ups once a year at least.|`|VXQFT341aa	It may just need a tune-up if it hasnt been done. The car is ten years old. Get new plugs and wires. But yes water can cauce a misfire too.|`|XKYJk6Tcaa	sounds as if you have a bad spark plug or bad wire. when was the last time you changed the plugs? snow /water will not effect your plugs causing cylinder misfires. they are shielded by the plug wires. however if the wires are old and brittle the graphite inside them will break causing a misfire. or if the plugs have not been changed in many many miles they could be fouled out. and once they plugged the code checker in that resets the check engine lite.|`|k55p1pKraa	If your wires get wet & you had a bad wire ,that wire would cause it to misfire, The reason the check engine light went off is because the wire dried out and allowed the light to reset.If it keeps showing up has a misfire it could as be a fuel injector that's bad.|`|gGBPPjLeaa	Moisture on an spark plug wire with ripped or damaged insulation will deinetly cause no starts when it wet and possibly a check engine, I know because it happened on a mazda of mine years ago. However water on the plug shoulld do little, same with the wires unless the actual wire is exposed.|`|ypk3jQgjaa	Yes and no. Not the way your thinking though. It can get under the distributor and cause shorting. The distributor is where the spark plug wires come from. Although it usually clears within a few hours after drying.

FgRUdQOBaa	What makes you think that?  They are still building, installing and upgrading signal systems using red and green lights.  There may be systems in the future that use strictly cab signals instead of trackside signals although these systems have never been as good as promised.   I can almost guarantee the incab signals will still use red/green light systems.|`|902bf06cc6e416f1757072330cfc5b9daa	I can't envision anything that may replace them.    Keep in mind what all they do.  They govern movement, in some instances they authorize movement, they indicate track occupancy ahead, they convey information relative to the handling of a train for controlled stops over long distances and many are wired in connection with some sort of electronic warning device, such as a slide fence or high water detectors.    I've railroaded in dark territory.  No thanks.  Signals also tell you whether you have railroad around the next corner or a washout waiting for you to arrive...|`|AA10164889	There is no serious plan for removing the existing signal systems on railroads.  Semaphore and searchlight signals are being retired, but they are being replaced with color light signals using red, amber, and green lenses or LEDs.    In the computer age, there may be schemes that augment light signals with in-cab voice, text, and/or symbol systems.  These will not totally replace light signals.|`|IkLzsqNVaa	Rango has a great point.     Modern rail equipment is capable of showing signal aspects to the crew directly inside the operating cab.  Sometimes maximum speeds are also shown (principally in Europe).     But I know of two rail lines near me that have recently undergone improvements which include wayside signals that those lines didn't have before.  While wayside signals as we know them today will likely disappear sometime, it's certainly not imminent.    In-cab signal and speed displays could potentially replace wayside signals, but they usually don't yet provide the same level of information.  Plus, it costs money to add such sensors and displays to older equipment.      Another technology that could replace wayside signals is Positive Train Control.  There are a few possible implementations of this, but the most promising ones at the moment involve Global Positioning System (GPS) telemetry.  A computer could track the location of every train on a track through GPS, and provide instructions to the operating crews for slowing and stopping.  It could also stop a train all by itself if the crew fails to act.      These technologies are both developing, so it will be decades before wayside signals completely disappear.|`|GKyhFu51aa	It's called cab signalling as in in-the-cab-signals.    It's already in use on Acela in the North-east corridor.    In addition to providing stop and clear to stop signals;  cab signalling gives speed commands to provide adequate spacing with the train ahead.  Wayside signals will still be in use as they are on Acela.    They will not be prevalent on freight only track as the speeds and block lengths are adequate for feight train speeds.    ABS (Automatic Block Signalling) and dark territory will continue to exist exist on secondary track.|`|dUN468v3aa	I don't agree with the criticisms already raised against existing in-cab signalling technology. Systems working on the "distance-to-go" principle are currently in use on the TGV network and Eurostar, and have been very successful.    The big advantage over fixed lineside signalling is that you can run at a much higher speed. In the UK the maximum permitted speed on any line is 125mph. We already have trains in service capable of 140mph but they are unable to run at this speed because the signal spacing is inadequate. Plus there are issues with how much sighting time a driver will have of a lineside signal when travelling at this higher speed. Sure, you could space the signals out further apart, but then you adversely affect the capacity of the line because of the longer signal sections. It really is a balancing act.    In-cab signalling removes both of these problems by providing all the information required on a dashboard-mounted display, so there are no worries about the driver missing a signal due to very high speed running. Lineside markers show the boundaries between the blocks. These blocks are often very much shorter than the signal sections with fixed lineside signalling. This means you can increase the maximum permitted speed of trains AND the line capacity at the same time.    There is more information on the TGV signalling system at the link given below.

ZTMjXz1saa	Don't forget that this is a career.  It's not all about simply building the hours.  Once you have your commercial pilots license, you are a professional pilot and as such, should be paid for your services.  If you accept a flying gig for free, then you are bringing down the industry.  Not everyone can afford to fly for free.  Some people need to actually make a living doing it.    I don't mean any offense, but it really annoys me when I hear people say they are willing to fly for free.    As for getting the hours required in order for you to get paid to fly, well, that's tough.  Many of us took out loans to do it.|`|EVHr4VpCaa	Instructing is the traditional way of building time.  The other options offered by the previous contributor work too.  If you have instrument rated pilot friends, you might try assisting them as a safety pilot.  You might also try working for a flight school and try to negotiate a reduced rate.    Student pilots are really restricted in what they can do.  There will not be many options until you have your private pilot certificate.

zotCYH89aa	Firewall is right in front of where your feet are, it's the panel between you and your engine.   Is your sub a raw speaker/driver or did it come in a box already?   There are a lot of things that can go horribly wrong with this job, including (on VW Beetles in particular) when you disconnect the battery you can **** up the stock radio and computer. I'd seek a professional installer for this, expect to pay around $100 plus the enclosure, but it's worth it to not destroy your car.

DydFQ0fcaa	Here's the symptoms of turbocharger failure due to oil starvation:  1. excessive engine oil consumption  2. oil leakage at the compressor  3. oil leakage at the turbine  4. the turbocharger generates acoustic noise    These side effects are caused by:  -clogged crankcase ventilation   -oil feed and drain lines are clogged or leaking  -piston ring sealing is defective  -turbocharger bearing damaged due to improper lubrication  -valve guide, piston rings and or cylinder liners worn because of increased blow-by    Keeping a close eye on the engine oil and crankcase ventilation system are the 2 most important aspects of maintaining a turbocharger. You need to use a high quality oil and filter and change them more often than you would on a non-turbo engine.|`|KbBWLMTgaa	THE SOUND OF THE TURBO WILL BE DIFFERENT IT WILL MAKE A GRINDING SOUND NOT ONLY THAT BUT YOU WILL BLOW THE SEALS OUT OF THE TURBO AND IT WILL BLOW SMOKE FROM YOUR EXHAUST.
t5ToQzN3aa	There are several reasons    1) Your mates might have passed their test much earlier.  2) They might have had insurance for a year and so qualified for a no claims discount e.g. 30%  3) A small car may not be a cheap car to insure - check the car group e.g. buy a Parkers guide (best for referencing lots of models)- for instance a VW Polo is much more expensive to insure than the equivalent Renault Clio  4) They might have persuaded their parents to commit a criminal act by insuring the car they drive in their parents name. Whilst it CAN be done legally if you know what you are doing (and I speak as an insurance broker), it is much more likely to have been done wrong.  5) Your mates might have looked in more places for their quotes.    OK! answer to 4: The parents must buy the car and register it in their name and must make a full disclosure as to the name of the main user.

Your history teacher tells you about the Central Pacific. Which is one of those nonsense names you always have to memorize, that means nothing to you, right?  Aha.  But he doesn't tell you, they almost immediately changed their name to the Southern Pacific.      You might have heard of the Southern Pacific.   That's kinda like "you might have heard of IBM".  They were one of the most powerful railroads in the country until about 10 years ago.   There are still Southern Pacific locomotives and cars running around that haven't been repainted yet.     Union Pacific didn't change their name, obviously, and they're still in business.  You can buy their stock.  It just went up 5% today.  They are the biggest railroad in America.     10 years ago, Southern Pacific got bought by another railroad.  Guess who :)    Yeah, it's a bit like Coke buying Pepsi.

It does have A/V inputs to connect external video sources to which can be watched while driving. Just don't let the cops see it on while driving. They have been known to make you remove it and cut the wires before allowing you to drive away. They won't let you simply unplug it because they know you will plug it back in once you get down the road. Or they will impound your car if you don't want to cut the wires.

FgRUdQOBaa	So far they are not any faster than conventional high speed rail. It's not friction limiting the speed, friction of steel wheels on steel rails is minimal.     When you compare the latest in mag-lev technology with the latest in conventional rail technology, they are within a few percentage points of one another. 1 minute of Googling can substantiate this if you doubt it.     In fact, the fastest speed on land is an unmanned rocket sled on conventional rail at Holloman AFB in New Mexico.     However, I think the potential for faster speeds may be slightly greater in mag-lev, the cost thus far has been horrendous and the energy needs to produce the powerful magnetic levitation force is not any saving over current technology.     The only way magnetic levitation trains can be considered faster is if you compare outdated old conventional rail systems.|`|AA10164889	Magnetic levitation (MAGLEV) vehicles are potentially faster than wheeled rail vehicles because they do not have to overcome rolling friction--there is no physical contact between track and vehicle other than magnetic resistance.  So far the technology has not realized its potential.|`|FsT54qh1aa	Mag lev trains can run faster simply because they aren't actually touching the track. There is no friction to limit a safe speed like a conventional wheeled train.|`|d1ee48df00eb4b8567acf7a43aeb1c1aaa	They're not.      At 300 mph it's all about the aerodynamics.  The magnets on the train are floating 1 inch above the magnets in the track.  The aerodynamic forces there are considerable.  It can be made to work, but it's complicated and expensive and delicate.      Meanwhile the steel wheel rolling on the steel rail has no worry about floating; it's supposed to be clamped to the rail with several tons of force.  If anything, aerodynamics makes that easier.  What holds back steel-wheel trains is available power, not the track.  Going a whole lot over 200mph just becomes a lose, because you spend too much energy gaining speed only to have to stop at the next station.  Or in the case of the various high speed tests, you run out of test track.

R1vZHRIDaa	Obtain as many secondary qualifications as you possibly can as secondary school is compulsory and so are the subjects your school does. While you are still at secondary school it is best and most advisable that you begin flying lessons in order to obtain your PPL license. This is the very first license you should obtain and after gaining your PPL you should continue to gain many other licenses and ratings:   Private Pilot License.  Instrument Rating;  Commercial License;  Multi-Engine license/add-on;  Certified Flight Instructor (CFI);  Certified Flight Instructor Instrument (CFII);  Advanced Ground Instructor (AGI);  Multi-Engine Flight Instructor (MEI).  There are quite a lot widely available. The first one you will do, PPL, you can start the lessons at a minimum age 14 years old, go solo at a minimum age 16 years old and obtain license at 17 years old. From there your instructor can advise you what to do next and from then on.  After secondary school, go on to tertiary education (Known as A-level in the UK, short for Additional Level). You can choose 4 or 5 courses to take for one year. For the second and final year you will drop one course. Preferably you want to be looking at taking Mathematics, Physics, A Language and a subject you enjoy. (If youre doing 5 subjects which is very rare choose something else useful e.g. Geography, Engineering or most of all English).  For the second year as I stated you drop one subject. It is very advised that you drop the subject you enjoy as the other subjects are your main priorities. If you gain all of these then move onto university, choose any course you like, preferably the course that you are best at as airlines don't mind which degree you have as long as you have one (However it is sometimes possible to become a pilot without a degree but is unlikely). Remember that during all these stages and levels of education continue with your flying and gaining more ratings and try to log as many hours as you possibly can. This is very important when it comes to decision time.   Airlines say that a degree isnt required, which is partly true but the competition is extremely high and candidates with a degree are head and shoulders above the candidates who dont have a degree. For university it is best that you choose to do a 4-year degree of the subject that you excel at the most. So, the subject you get best at A-Level, carry it on to degree level as airlines don't mind which degree you have obtained but as long as you have one (although a degree isn't a necessity). Or you could do a combinational degree as I did; I did Mathematics, Further Mathematics, Physics and Spanish at A-Level and carried Mathematics and Spanish on to degree level. The choice is yours on which subject to do.  Also, if you really want to become a pilot then you will be a better candidate if you have logged hours in a light aircraft. It is advisable that you log a bare minimum of 600 hours but really try to excel that target.  So, while youre still at secondary school I suggest you begin taking flying lessons to obtain a PPL (Private Pilot License). Minimum ages are:  Begin lessons: 14  Go solo: 16  Obtain license: 17  Once you have obtained this you should log as many hours as you possibly can before entering university as you will be struggling financially unless youre rich.  So by the age of 22 you could have all your GCSE's, 4 A/S levels. 3 A levels, a degree and a PPL license.  With this you are an almost perfect candidate and stand an extremely strong chance of becoming a pilot. This is the way I did it so I like to think it would help other people as well.    For training for a PPL on a Cessna 150M here are the costs:  45 hours flying C150 - 5,175  Landing fees (estimate) - 300  Training items - 175  Annual membership varies for each school but mine is 99.50  Radio-telephony test fee - 55  Total - 5,804    GROUND STUDIES:  Ground school (when required) 25 per hour  Written exams - 30 each  IMC test - 65  Radiotelephony test - 65  PPL skill test - 130  Class 2 medical examination - 140    If you want to do it in a better plane such as a Tobago TB10 then add 21 for every hour you take.    Self hire for these aircraft are approximately 95 per hour including landing fee    Class 1 Medical examination  Study books (7 books at approx $30 each)  Instrument Rating  Radiotelephony equipment and test fee  Landing fees (varies on size of airport)  Ground studies and tuition  Written examination fee  PPL Skill test  IMC test  The only clothing you need is a highly visible vest (bright green or yellow)  Membership  Total cost approx 5500  I apologize that I dont know which country your from so I cant exchange the prices myself.  The prices vary with which aircraft you learn in.|`|u2ubQK3Yaa	go to the USA armed forces recruiter and take the flight exam.   I did.   If you pass , and you are a grad like you are, you may get into their flight school.|`|FKXG3IPiaa	Join an institute giving pilot training and get CPL.|`|fZjgIE9Baa	First off, college. Not all airlines require a degree. Several of the "regional" airlines don't require a degree. However, most of the "majors" do. So where do you want to end up? Charter flying and other corporate flying has a policy on a per-company basis. But if you have it, it may put you ahead of someone who doesn't.    Air Force.  You'll be committed to them for no less than 10 years. Are you prepared to devote that time? Not to mention you'll be IN the military and may have to deploy, fight, and possibly pay the ultimate sacrifice. It may be for you, it may not.    If you do choose college, then the question is do you chose an "aviation university" or not. Aviation Universities include Embry Riddle, Auburn University, along with many more. OR, you can choose to attend an "airline academy" which will be independent of a 4 year degree but will have you ready from start to ready for an airline interview in XX number of days/months.  These include Delta Connection Academy     Anyway, to be competitive for a regional airline right now you will ultimately need (in terms of flight experience) your Commercial Multi Airplane license with an Instrument rating at probably AT LEAST 800 hours of flight time of which at least 100 hours should be in a multi-engine airplane.    If you go to one of the academy's be prepared to spend around $25,000 up front (or within a few months) to get that commercial multi.... Other wise, if you obtain the licenses/ratings as you go the following will become familiar terms to you:  -- Private Pilot License  -- Instrument Rating  -- Commercial License  -- Multi-Engine license/add-on  -- Certified Flight Instructor (CFI)  -- Certified Flight Instructor Instrument (CFII)  -- Advanced Ground Instructor (AGI)  -- Multi-Engine Flight Instructor (MEI)    I would also recommend www.aopa.org to investigate learning to fly.

What do you mean "it barely gets any clutch"?  The clutch slips? - accelerate and the bike doesn't move?  Won't disengage? - pull in the clutch lever, shift into gear and the engine stalls?|`|Dh8i9msPaa	Did you forget the clutch fluid.....just kidding.|`|ncwQ6IYlaa	Well you have to be absolutely certain that you have the right plates - the right number and in perfect order according to a service manual or it wont work. Then you have to have free play in the lever and the linkage. i am not sure what you mean by "adjusted the clutch lever as far back as i can". The lever should have just a "little freeplay" before taking up. this play should be measured at the gap where the cable joins the lever and be about 4-5 mm or 3/16 of an inch. Did you replace the steel separator plates too? Sometimes the problem with the clutch is these plates are warped (not flat) and the clutch will NOT work with warped separator plates.|`|JJsJaQjxaa	Your clutch cable may be past the point of adjustment. You already figured out where the one is on your handlebars. There's also another adjustment at the bottom of the cable where it meets up with the case. You can tighten up that end, then loosen up the one on your bars so you have more adjust-ability. Also make sure you're not actually adjusting your clutch tension the other way. You could be increasing the slack, but actually be thinking you're decreasing it.

AA10409227	Jettas are nice cars if they've been well cared for, but they are not very reliable and pricey to fix. I would only buy it if you knew for sure the owner was very fussy about his car -- like oil changes every 5000 miles.  Better choice: a used Mazda3 or Mazda Protege. Handles better and more reliable. Good Luck.|`|OhJCZKW2aa	Hey well i just bought a 2000 Jetta VR6! i tell you it is the SWEETEST car out there! ok, well my brother owned a 1999 TDI jetta and it had some problems cuz he messed it up! the car also was one of the first desil jettas in our town! But back to my car! i got a 36k 3 year warrenty that cost me 1800$ yea i know expensive but it covers everything minus wear and tear on the vehicle! My jetta has 91k miles and it is now covered till i reach 120k i think thats a great deal for some peace of mind! So what i advise you doing is get a jetta below 100k miles and make sure u get comprehensive insurance! it better cover everything. See if you can take it to a big dealership and see if they will give u warrenty! Goodluck!
1NumX5aqaa	Yes vtec will be noticeable. Vtec is very nice because it maintains good economy at lower rpm but when you mash the pedal and reach the correct rpm and oil pressure (between 4.8-5.4k rpm on b series typically) vtec will kick in and take a wilder cam profile and more performance oriented fuel air curve boosting your power by about 30 hp. As far as 9k while stock... only the Integra type-r can get that high, a b16a2 (found in eg6) will get to 8.2k. If you want a b16 to SAFELY reach 9k then build the valve train, aside from that I wouldn't push it past 8.5 but even then... you are just getting out of the power band and might actually be going slower, the only way to tell for sure is with dyno results.    As far as anyone hitting 11,000 rpm on a stock b series engine... that is just a bad idea, why you would do that unless you were throwing the engine away... I don't know. If you want to pick up an Ebay chip that removes the rev limiter and rev it til it blows then hey, maybe you can hit 15k for a second or two.|`|dRozk0cCaa	vtec is really noticeable. you could actually go up to 12 rpms in the type r if you switch out the cams. but like basic mods would be intake, headers, exhaust and it's really up to you if you want to do the internals of the motor. right now i could only get my motor up to 9,500 rpms. vtec is special cause its a big kick if you like to go fast. I LOVE VTEC|`|gOQ5mZ7Xaa	I don't know about Integras or Civics but yes Hondas can go up to 9k RPMs as stock.|`|BVkTu26paa	Stock, yes.. 9000rpms..    I've seen as far as 11000rpms tuned on a stock b18c engine    Vtec is very noticeable on certain cars equipped with the performance version of vtec engines...    Try test driving any si car, or better an s2000... it's very noticeable!!  If you ever feel vtec in a light chassi, it's crazy.

d9ECb7N8aa	That is a fairly low gear for the 3-spd trans. It really depends on what type of driving you are going to be doing.    I had a '70 with a 3-spd auto (TH350) running a 255/75R16 tire and 3.08 gears. I would turn around 3k at 75mph. So there is a comparison for your cruising speed.    You should be able to spin the tires... My factory spec 327 with a 2-barrel would get it in a straight line pretty good.|`|XFZmAMOAaa	Thats a good combo,low enough to squeel the tires and still high enough to get a little fuel milage out of it.Automatics usually have a higher geared rear end behind them.|`|8740c9d03300d2d76f91ceaf7a9ffc93aa	Yes!
J1MTGkTCaa	Shelby:  The exhaust flange is the part that mates the exhaust header and exhaust pipe together.  The header has a recess cut into it and the pipe has a sort of lip which mates with it.  Used with a gasket and tightened with usually a couple of bolts coming out of the header and nuts, it provides a sealing of the exhaust system from that point, on back to the catalytic converter or muffler.|`|KRunjrzNaa	it seals the exhaust pipes to the engine!

51d9e39c71aaaed7424c9ac49e9069c5aa	If you've got a good layer of paint on it, you can wet sand it with 400 or 600 grit paper - it's a heck of a lot of work but I can't think of an easier way to remove orange peal.   After you sand it all smooth, you might want to think about getting it clear coated. The results will will be a much glossier finish - and way more durable than straight enamel.|`|TxV2DRpNaa	Impossible! needs to be repainted.|`|Gn0kJXHpaa	sand, re-sand again & then repaint.  Wet sand means keep water running over the wet sandpaper as you sand.  Buff means to polish to high shine|`|dGLuEFyKaa	Possible but hard to do. Try wet 2000 and then buff. I think it takes a lot of your time so better sand it a little (wet600 or 800) and put two light coats of clear. Then you can buff it for mirror:)

gFHTcIc8aa	DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!    TELL YOUR DEALER TO READ MAINTENANCE MANUAL!    I have a 2005 Honda Odyessey with 58000 miles. I have not changed timing belt, nor plan to, before 60000. I'm fairly sure the owner's manual recommends a change around 60000 miles. I will probably stretch it (pun intended) to 75k miles or so, but it won't push it much further.  A failed timing belt will most likely result in bent valves, an expensive engine repair.    22K miles is very low milage for a timing belt change.  Most will last a minimum of 60k.  I've never heard of a new from stock belt failing before 60k miles. I owned a Honda Accord prior to this and did not change belt until 80000 miles, but that is a different engine, same basic design.      The reason the belt is expensive is not the belt itself but the labor involved of removing and reinstalling the belt.      The belt may be considered a normal wear and tear on your warranty, but if a belt fails before 60K it's definitely not normal & you may be able to make a case of this if this unlikely event were to happen|`|AA10788363	Very odd for a timing belt to go that early on an honda.  If it under warranty then get it replaced.  If not try a second opinion.  If i was there I could tell you in a second if your timing belt is bad.  When you turn over the key does the engine sound like a hi whining sound....  Need more symptoms.. to diagnose.|`|zOIgzIy4aa	i would,nt think it,s time for a belt yet. heck there,s not enough miles on it yet.|`|Gn0nR2S1aa	What year is it? If its older, then even though the miles are low the belt has deteriorated due to age and it might not be a bad idea to get it replaced. If its new, like less than 4 yrs, then yes they are trying to sell you what you don't need. That is unless there is a reason they told you that you didnt tell us.|`|7gpAdJGaaa	I WOULD TAKE IT TOO SOMEONE I KNEW OR IN YOUR CASE A CLOSE PERSONAL MECHANIC OF A RELATIVE TRY SEVERAL

SkMjo0fNaa	The best rule of thumb is if the car has 75% of it's value worth of damage they will not budge. VERY few will let it get to 100% of the value. You can always buy your car back from the insurance company for cheap because they do want to make money off of it.    I had a car I just loved that got totalled and I ended up buying it back from less than $500 from the insurance company and then having it fixed. Their estimates were high and I ended up with $200 left over, so I got new tires.|`|rkuHaiV6aa	Insurance companies will total a car when it costs more to fix it than the car is worth. Very often they will hedge on it a little and pay a bit more because the customer usually wants the car fixed and it saves them the recovery costs.    If you really like he car (wrecked) you ought to strike a deal with the ins co to keep it.|`|j3f8m6REaa	This has nothing to do with the insurer, it's a state law that requires the car be declared a 'total loss' once repair costs exceed the value. You may be able to buy the car as-is from the insurer but you face a huge pile of trouble getting it retitled.   My advice: take the sunvisor or something off the car as a keepsake and go buy another one.|`|142CwdVyaa	Using google to find some related info or you could try using answer engines such as yahoo answer or yedda.com to obtain some useful ideas.however,If you want some direct infomation,here http://www.AutoInsuranceFree.info/free-a...  is a nice one from my experience.
wiXk7ODdaa	Old Volvos are not only well built cars, but they're also cool as hell. That's why you need to bite the bullet and pay the money to get it repaired NOW - before the engine is lost completely. Every time you drive it with bad rings more damage is done to your valves. You can either pay the money and get it fixed, or drive it till it dies and get another car. As is, my guess is it has approx 3-4k miles left before it dies.|`|zOIgzIy4aa	it won,t hurt nothing. it,s the valve seals leaking. just pay attention to the oil and make sure it stays full.|`|ZGgh4yJ1aa	I like what the hippie said about pollution, but the rings and cylinders are wearing out, probably your valve guides, and seals and just about everything that can wear out, it will get worse and harder to start.|`|7gpAdJGaaa	I WOULDN'T|`|nRvRU6yJaa	You should have the rings changed this will hurt the engine over time you can try a heavier weight oil and something like lucas oil or restore treatment this may work.|`|JMJsCU1vaa	you are burning oil, and polluting the air, more then you think, people who drive cars like that for more than the time it takes to notice a problem, should be criminal.  Cars that smoke should be given inspection tickets and required to immediately go to an emissions inspection facility and immediately taken off the road if they fail.|`|AA10788363	The reason you blow smoke when the engine is cold is because your piston rings are cold and letting engine oil into the compression chamber. When your engine heats up the metal in your piston rings expand and create a seal hence no smoke.  Its a sign of engine wear.  You can ignore the smoke but check your oil levels at least once a week.  Eventually your engine will die but stay on the maintanence and you should be ok for a while.|`|Fp50ZK2Laa	absolutely not, the old rings are scratching the inside of the cylinders and damaging your engine, you want to fix this as soon as possible|`|eCZery89aa	Look the engine is worn out.  It will probably run a while like it is but to fix it.  Its gonna need a overhaul at best.  You could try some other weights of oil but,  you should use what the engine is supposed to have in it.
AA12261615	the cummins has a longer life span,the only problems they give is with the cooling system, and that's due to dodges design of the radiator system they have ,you need to flush those out real often or you get a heavy build up of sludge and gum in the cooling system,other than that they are the best of the bunch,good luck.|`|7b0903c0e39a55a5230350128e4fcff1aa	Cummins|`|a70d82417eb7a74192f967dcdc832b20aa	Cummins.|`|TcVDna27aa	cummins or duramax    duramax has more power to the wheels but cummins is good too|`|N7LlOAcOaa	DODGE CUMMINS~!

But all cummins engines are great the duramax is a far cry from first but is foresure second.  I curently own a 1998 3500 12V engine, manual, and extended cab.  I have changed tranny, rear and front end fluids every 50,000 miles.  And the engine oil every 3,000 and i have 1.3 million miles on the stock engine and a once rebuilt tranny.  yes 1.3 million miles.  I dont use it anymore because i have bigger better trucks now but i still have it and will never part with it.  I have put every mile on that truck and plan to keep it that way.  I used to haul 9 horses and a 1,000 pounds of hay to cali n back once a week.  That motor will outlast anyone running.  It has never been rebulit or had troubles with anything but they tranny one time.  Just do maintance every week and some cleaning every so often and it wil be the best truck you ever own.
dQrBlk4qaa	The sound will be terrible, and your 305 will not pick up any real improvement with cutouts. You may gain a little higher up, but nothing really in a normal driving range. You're engine runs out of cylinder head/cam/intake well before the range where a cutout will serve you well.    I respectfully disagree, however, with the previous post. Engines do not need back-pressure; that was older-school theory. What benefits an engine with a closed exhaust is the reversion of the exhaust pulse that travels from any pipe transition back toward the engine - its a sonic wave that, when tuned properly, helps scavenge the exhaust by creating a low-pressure 'reflection'. A cutout eliminates this tune, resulting in poorer scavenging at low-mid rpms.    Back to topic - if you're going to do any exhaust work, you should be thinking of a nice set of 1 5/8" headers, running to an H or X pipe, into dual high-flow cats and a dual 2 1/2 free flowing exhaust. That will give you the best sound characteristics, legality, and performance.    Then, start seriously considering upgrading your TPI manifold and try to score some AFR 305 heads.|`|euXfb9aGaa	First, it's illegal.    Second, you NEED backpressure for your engine. Cutouts will make it louder. Not faster. You might even lose some performance.    But it will sound louder, so you'll think it's faster...so it's kinda pointless anyway.    Stick with a decent catback exhaust. More gains than you'll ever see with cutouts.|`|AXNkmdbKaa	Install the cutouts and then take your car to a drag strip.  Find out if it runs better with the cutouts open or closed by comparing time slips obtained in each condition.  Try it several times.  It will be faster with the cut-outs open or you need some serious tuning on your engine.  But not enough to matter.  And it is probably illegal due to the noise and possible pollution but would be a good learning experience.|`|8zVxYkluaa	No, it's overkill.  Not to mention it'll sound like crap.    You're better off spending the $$ elsewhere.

If your tight for cash don't bother.|`|bLjGM9yNaa	Your mileage really isn't that high to kick in the " no touch" scenario.      Get yourself a Haynes or Chilton repair manual and look over the      procedure for a fluid change & maybe a filter ( unless it's a screen      type ).  Then decide what you want to do.  Even if you decide to      leave it alone, at least you've  got yourself a repair manual at your      fingertips for future reference on your new investment. You may also      find this repair manual at your local library to borrow from time to      time.

Clean tranny fluid is red. A darker red is normal, but if it looks a little more blacker than i would replace it.     Ha also may just be trying to get more money out of you.|`|094aeb51fddd6738244640604bb4b38daa	My 95 has 170,000 miles on it & I have never changed it since I took ownership at 67,000 mi. It shifts smooth & is trouble free. These are great cars!  You are right about leaving it alone with high miles, especially with the Maxima tranny. I have read more than a handful of stories about jerky shifting after fluid change.  I would pull out your dipstick, run tubing down & siphon out a quart. Put in a new quart of Maxima specific tranny fluid & see if there is any change in shifting.  Oil consumption seems to be the biggest issue for your generation Maxima but if yours is good you're all set.  Wheel bearings are also an issue, IMO because if the bearings are repacked or the rotor is removed to be turned or replaced, people cheap out and reuse the locknut or don't tighten it to factory specs (250 ftlbs).
mR5ZtjqWaa	the noise signature, (pitch/whine/vibration) might be different due to engine type and engine position, but actual decibel levels inside the cabin will be similar, with the 717 being possibly louder due to its older rolls Royce engines and depending on which version of 737 you are comparing it to.   Average cabin noise levels of all jet powered aircraft is 74.4 dB. (between 70 and 79 dB)  its difficult to lower cabin noise levels below 70 because engines must be attached to the aircraft, and vibrations cannot be dampened completely. In addition to the actual engine operating noise and vibs, there is the sound of the air rushing past, which, surprisingly, accounts for quite a bit of the total noise level inside.     typically, newer aircraft means newer engines, which, in turn, means a quieter cabin. Most 737's are newer than 717s.|`|fCOq04lNaa	Well I haven't flown on either of those planes(I have flown in similar ones, the 757 and the MD80, both behind or a wee bit forward of the wing). As for the 717 vs 737, it should be about the same. The BR715s on the 717 are pretty quiet, but if you sit aft of the wing, you're in close proximity to them. In aircraft with wing mounted engines noise is distributed more evenly across the plane but usually the seats behind the wing tend to be louder than in front of the wing.       The CFM56s on the 737s and the BR715s on the 717 sound different, but the loudness should be pretty close.|`|3cp5vuILaa	No not really. There might be some sound coming into the cabin from the 737 engine. The 717 engines are like right on the whole plane making a louder sound in the cabin.

Good luck.|`|2OQgz2uqaa	contact your DMV|`|mIlWfcOVaa	go to tha dmv or onlinee :)|`|NaHMdUASaa	No, you need to go pick up the title only and bring that and any other forms (depending on your state) to the RMV and gets the plates and register it there.  Then you usually have something like 7 days to get it inspected so just do it in that time frame.  This might be different in other states, but I doubt it
9FlCQQXnaa	My father has a 1999 Suzuki Grand Vitara JLX and to this day he has over 120K miles and NEVER had a issue with it. You can find them pretty cheap now. I see 2002's on eBay going for $4,000 once in a while.    Trust me, it's a good car and they don't break down after 60K miles.

Are you trying to purchase a remote but they don't know which one to sell you?or you have remotes but you can't get them to program?    OK, to answer your question the module you're looking for is called  (remote control door lock receiver)  To access the module you must remove the  top pad of the dash only.  easy job if you know what to remove (10 minutes)once that's off the module sits right on top in the middle of the dash (it has a blue connector). can't miss it.
SuZbBnycaa	It typically takes banks and lenders about 5-6 weeks. They are very slow.    But you can get a registration right away (at least in California)  Form REG 227 is Duplicate Title form. Buyer and seller fill it out as if it were the title. Include odometer reading on REG 262. Get it smogged. Pay transfer fee $15 and Use Tax (about 7.5% of value of car, depending on county) The DMV (or AAA Auto Club) will "RDF" for the title...meaning they will not complete the transfer until the title is received from the lender and you return to the DMV with it. but in the mean time you leave that day with a registration that has your name on it as legal owner.     Seller should sign a Release of Liability.|`|rkuHaiV6aa	Call the bank and ask them!
SuZbBnycaa	For CA DMV rules: A title is what you keep in your safety deposit box and the registration is what you keep in the car.    We have 2 transfers here, 1. lady to guy  2. guy to you.   It costs $15 each time there is a transfer. ($30 now)    You need a bill of sale between lady and guy  you need a bill of sale between guy and you.  You need duplicate title form from DMV with guy's signature and yours.  Odometer reading and smog certificate.  You will pay Use Tax which is based on the value of the car.   Seller responsible for car passing smog...but that's negotiable.    You can do this at the DMV or AAA Auto Club if you're a member  The DMV/AAA will be able to tell you if the car has a lien on it, is stolen or if anyone ever signed a Release of Liability.  they will give you a new registration with your name on it and new tags for the license plate. The title is mailed to you.|`|mnvLeA3Gaa	when you purchased the car you should have recvied a bill of sale, which has proof that it now is your car and that it has been sold to you.

rqeEhVvXaa	Yous suspension is hydraulic oil not compressed air    If you try to bleed it oil under high pressure will escape   be very care full.         You have to have 4 wheels of the ground to bleed the system     Sounds more  like you have a problem with the self leveling valve|`|bqLvWpcZaa	I agree with the above.  The self levelling valve is located at the back and there is a rod attached from the valve to the rear sway bar.  This is the usual culprit to go south on the Benz hydropneumatic self-levelling systems..|`|93180007ab7804e4a61c8c8f52c6fe34aa	The mercedes hydraulic suspension consists of hydraulic struts coupled by steel tubes to nitrogen filled spheres. The nitrogen in the spheres is what provides the shock absorber action, not the struts. The buckboard ride results  when the nitrogen works it's way through the membranes in the spheres, and is lost. At that point, your hydraulic system is completely filled with incompressible fluid, and the ride will be rock hard.     The only solution is to replace the nitrogen spheres.    But the bad news doesn't end there. The reason your rear sits so high is that there is a problem with the leveling valve. This sometimes happens when the coupling link betweent the leveling valve and sway bar becomes disconnected. Or it could be misadjusted. OTH, the leveling valve may need to be replaced. If you disconnect the link, you should be able to raise and lower the car to any desired level by moving the lever on the valve. If not, the valve itself is done.

vGxr9e59aa	You can attend an aeronautics school, such as Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University (http://www.erau.edu/), but no one will hire you as a pilot fresh out of school, not even to haul freight, until you've accumulated a few thousand hours of flight experience.  Most aspiring pilots do this by getting their Certified Flight Instructor (CFI) tickets and training other pilots at local flight schools around the country for a couple of years.  The Air Force and Navy routes are good for building fixed wing time; the Army is good for rotary wing time.  In fact, you'll find that many airline pilots are former military pilots.|`|m4wFJPAOaa	Go to college and get a degree in aeronautics.

Just remember that you have to pay them back with like 10 years of service if they pay for your flight training.    If you can afford it I would say go to your local flight school and get all your rating done.  Will your doing your flight training, go to your local college and get a 4 year degree in anything.  Most airlines look for a 4 year degree in anything.  If you do your flight training in college it will take you a lot longer to get done.

AT0e3xwAaa	Never heard of a law like that. Have had customer sign release to drive unsafe vehicle absolving me of any legal issues.|`|wpgRMjgraa	No such law, they cannot do this but what we do is request that the unsafe vehicle owner sign a liability waiver before driving away. We also stamp on the invoice  "UNSAFE TO DRIVE" and if the customer refuses to to sign the waiver they "MUST" sign the invoice to release the car from our shop....|`|51d9e39c71aaaed7424c9ac49e9069c5aa	Why would anyone need to be prevented from driving an unsafe car?    Allow me to play devil's advocate:     Suppose the mechanic had essentially ignored the risk and rather than argue, simply sent the customer on his way.  The customer leaves and gets into an accident.   There is no way in hell that you can ever convince me that the customer isn't going to sue that mechanic.  Even if the mechanic had the driver sign a waiver relieving him of all responsibility - it's the mechanic who is the alleged expert and the driver who all of a sudden knows nothing at all about cars - again, the mechanic would get sued.    Is it "authority" that's necessary - or a little CYA common sense?|`|a8m3HdDHaa	Never heard of such a law, though I have seen service manager list a problem on service ticket and have owner sign it before he left.|`|84150d8c6cd9fc2e974272b0e0ddc3c3aa	A mechanic cannot seize your car for being unsafe.  You are free to have an unsafe car towed, it is still your property.  However, depending on the laws in a particular state or province, he may be required by law to prevent you from driving away, maybe by having your tags seized.  Ontario is one of those jurisdictions where it is required that a mechanic rule an unsafe vehicle off the road until it is repaired.    But, law aside, if I were a station owner in a state or province that did not allow me to have your car ruled off the road, and your vehicle was unsafe, you would be signing a document clearly accepting that you had been advised your vehicle was unsafe at any speed, and absolving me of any culpability in any accident in which you may be involved.  In Winnipeg, the police operate an inspection unit within the traffic division.  Your plate number would be reported to them, they would inspect your car and pull it off the road if they agreed with the unsafe assessment.   I am sure some other cities have similar units.    However, no mechanic can actually seize your vehicle.  Like it said, it is your property, and, if he rules it unsafe, in the jurisdictions where he has the authority, can have plates pulled and not let the vehicle go unless on the hook of a tow truck.    I have only once had a vehicle in such a state, and it was a result of a defective part that snapped, but I had the part replaced on the spot by the mechanic that pointed it out to me,so it was, in my case, a moot point.    Unfortunately, there are many dangerous vehicles on the road.  I knew of one that had a ball joint missing, and the owner had welded a section of chain in place.  It was only a mandatory inspection that brought it to light.  Because it was a government inspection, he couldn't drive the car away, it could only be towed to a shop for repair, or to his home after registration was cancelled, with a note on file that it could not be put back on the road until it was given a pass on the inspection.    You will not get a link to any federal law on this.  If somebody posts a link, it will be for one particular state or province.  I, for one, am not going to search databases in all 50 states, all 10 Canadian provinces, and the territories, I don't know of anybody that has that much time.  I suggest you search the laws in your home state, because they are the only ones that will apply to you, and it seems you are also the only one that knows where you live.    Edit:  I am not sure why I, living in Manitoba, would post Ontario laws, unless you lived in Ontario.  The only laws relevant to you are the laws for the state or province in which you actually live, and you STILL haven't told us that.  The way I read your question it seems to me you are somewhere in the US, Ontario is in Canada.  I have often researched various state and provincial laws and requirements for people on YA, but, again, for the laws that actually apply to the person asking.|`|xYMjXqhZaa	I don't know of any links, but if I were that mechanic I would be on the phone with a police officer to come and inspect the car.          Here in Pennsylvania if a mechanic licensed to perform inspections deems a car unsafe he can, by law, declare it "condemned" until repaired.|`|ypk3jQgjaa	Yeah there is no possible way. If your car is being held at the shop call the police and I'm not joking! I swear if someone held my P.O.S. I would slaughter them. lol|`|YegFsJyhaa	Never heard of an actual law but have known manager to phone police to inform them of the intended law breaking.

It's 100% pointless to ask what car is more reliable than another, because it is 100% dependent on the owner.    Any of those would be good choices. I'd lean towards the Neon, but there's no basis for that except personal preference.|`|CwpCyFzvaa	I know that the Neon is the most comfortable and has the most power, but the Accent and the Rio get the best gas mileage and are more reliable.  \Happy Shopping
q4nrL1C6aa	Company training is available from every major manufacturer, but the cost is paid by the dealership.  It costs thousands of dollars to send a tech to school for a week of training, and most dealerships only send their top techs for training because it's so expensive and only when a new model comes out.    HD uses the PHD (Professional Harley-Davidson) system of videos, classroom training, hands-on training, classroom testing, online testing, and hands-on testing to determine if you can pass that particular topic.  I think there's about 75 PHD's right now, I'm not sure because I haven't worked at a HD dealership in a while.    If it costs a dealership $2500-$3000 per tech to go to Milwaukee and get trained (for example, the Buell 1125R class is only in Milwaukee for now), then it would cost the dealership around $200,000 to get all the same PHD certifications that you would get by attending MMI.    I don't think there is a HD dealership out there that would hire a new tech with zero experience and no MMI graduation.    Sure, there's WyoTech which used to be called AMI.  They've got a new place near Daytona that's much better than the old motel they used to have classes in (yes, it had a swimming pool which never had water in it).  The problem with WyoTech is that they don't have the same factory support that you get with MMI, in fact, Harley-Davidson sends their dealership techs for training to MMI (in some cases, some classes are only offered at the factory).|`|3GyWOriBaa	Take a look at MMI online,there school is a great way to get in.

f8531989672c18c4535bcda561ab4073aa	Sounds like the valve body in the transmission has blown a seal and it now leaking the pressure. The pressure is used to power the transmission. It is leaking in to the pan area that holds the fluid and forcing the fluid out. Also if you over fill the transmission it may over flow. Transmission fluid expands as it gets hot . That is why your asked to check the fluid level when the transmission is at operating temperature.|`|6CyScIKBaa	to much back pressure seal for valve body or valve body itself is junk|`|AA12265870	This is confusing because the transmission dipstick has a locking cap and the fluid would come out the vent hose first.Are you sure its not the coolant bottle overflowing?|`|t3Mq9Tooaa	How many quarts did you put into it the last time you changed it?

ffab341laa	It depends on how high up you wanna go. Leveling kit only allow 2-3 inches and include new torsion bars and blocks or springs for the rear. On your truck that will allow enough room for 33s (tires).       If you get a lift kit a four inch will only allow for 33s as well. It will also include a lot more work. So unless you want 35s or bigger go with a leveling kit.

Drain the oil and remove the pan. then turn it over and remove the carb and the valve covers, and the rockers, then the push rods, then the intake, and distributor. Then remove the head bolts and remove the heads. feel around the top of each piston to see how much of a ring grove you have. turn the engine over again and remove the rod cap bolts, on one cylinder at a time take a dead blow hammer and tap on the rod studs but do not let them scratch the crank. this will drive the pistons out the cylinders. then remove the main caps and timing chain and gears and you can remove the crankshaft and cam shaft.  then take the crank and cam and pistons and block to the machine shop they will be able to mic. the cylinders and crank to see how much under they need to go on the boring and cleaning the crank. have them boil the block and install new cam bearings for the cam you chose and they can tell you if you need to replace the pistons, you will need to replace the main and rod bearings, the timing chain and the freeze plugs in the block. the machine shop can tell you all the sizes they needed to straighten everything out. then start to resemble the engine using allot of assembly lube.|`|eESXiy7paa	not to be rude..but..if ya gotta ask this question..well, just go buy a rebuilt motor from a reputable company..it will save you a lot of headaches, get ya up and running sooner and probably save some money too....|`|ZGgh4yJ1aa	A monkey with a screwdriver and pliers can build a 350, just get a manual for anything '85 and earlier with a 350, you're going to need machine work anyway, so go talk to an engine shop and they can give you a parts quote as well.

You should NOT be driving ANY car on which you are not insured.  If you happened to be involved in a crash, (other party's fault) their insurance could refuse to compensate for injuries or damages.   On your ticket, you might be able to appear in court and have the ticket either dismissed or the fine reduced.  I'm not familiar with speed cameras.  I know they're not in California, (yet!)|`|jmMXz7yeaa	yes you pay the ticket before the court date you need to pay prob now and the insurance won't go up unless you got in a wreck|`|ypk3jQgjaa	If a camera got you it's going to go by who is registered with the cars license plate.
YLajQcFkaa	Um Rare?  Ok its rare but not in a good way at all.  Those cars are close to the top of the list of the biggest mistake car BMW ever produced.  RARE only because there was no demand for them.  Most of the ones that were sold have sold cheap to people who are trying to keep their 850 going.  There really are no real rare cars except very high end cars where there was a limited production run designed to make millionaires and billionaires buy them at a way overinflated price just for bragging rights.  Car owners love to use the term "rare" as a good thing when its usually a very bad thing.  Ok Yes you have the American cars that are rare. Since Nas car instated a rule way back in the day nascar said if you wanted a car in the race you had to sell X many to the public for the car to be a "stock car".  Then you have the antique cars where the company failed or never really got off the ground.  Really there are rare cars that are "nice" rare but they are few and far between.

MH2Je94waa	I don't know about Michigan, but here's what I go through in Texas.  It's not that tough in the state of Texas.  You have to do some leg work and spend a few bucks.  You can easily get a copy of the title, it's getting the title transferred that will cause you more problems.  After a few times I started paying a title person to do it all for me.  They charged me about $100 on top of whatever state fees had to be paid, but they always get the title back to me with my name on it and good tags with a new license plate.  The most costly part is getting the insurance.  Wait till you get the bike all ready to run and then go hire you a title person.  It's been a while, but I want to say it used to take about 4 weeks because of the waiting period of sending a certified letter to the person that is actually on the title.|`|1xkc6Ktmaa	It may be possible to get a title for it.

Years back the hassle was Alabama title paperwork was used to get other state title for stolen vehicles- the paperwork issued had space for inspection signature that finalised title in Alabama-- no inspectors signature meant it was a open application, other states and federal gripes were dismissed as their own fault for issueing their state title on Alabama application that was less than 30 or 60 days old- Alabama wouldn't consider it valid for sales transfer unless inspected , other state shouldn't have issued title uless they inspected and checked. .|`|6f89b5d16dbdb895634e3f8c49efb428aa	Check out autotitles.com.

If you live in a home, then have a system in your home so you can watch what is going on from the inside.  Also you may want to consider parking your car in a garage if possible.  But from what you are saying, that isn't an option.  If you must park in a parking lot, then you want to get an alarm system if you don't have one.  That way if someone so much as brushes up against your car, the alarm will sound and it will likely scare the suspects away while alerting you to something going on.  Also it wouldn't hurt to call local authorities.  Ask them to prowl the areas.  Police officers are obligated to come to your area when you report any suspicious activities.  If they come to your area, their presence will deter any further crimes, but I'd suggest getting an alarm for your car, and install the cameras in your apartment or your home.|`|BgwTxzEFaa	Locking gas caps can be broken off in about 5 seconds.

Some info from the epa site on emissions regulations on kit cars.    http://www.epa.gov/oms/imports/kitcar.ht...|`|uFQFRdczaa	Crash safety, not usually.  Crash safety testing is required for selling cars, not for driving them.      For smog, it may depend on how you register the car.  Most of the time it's easier to register a kit car as an existing car, esp. since kits often use some parts (frame and engine) of an existing car (most often a VW beetle) and in some states you can register as the donor car even if all you're keeping is the vin number.  This may mean you can skirt the smog requirements.  For example, in TN cars built before 1974 are exempt from emissions if the drive train is unmodified.  This means a kit car registered as a 1968 Beetle will be exempt as long as it has an engine that could have been found in a 68 Beetle.
SOfbIOzUaa	Well, you never know!    Back in the 1970's someone listed a Porsche 914 for only $75 in the a free shopper thing that was mailed to every home in the area. I think it was called the Penny Shopper or something like that. Anyway, everyone who read the ad thought it was a misprint and that the seller was likely asking $7500 [a lot of money at the time for a used car]. that is everyone except for one high school kid who went and bought the car. When this kid's dad came home from work he wanted to know where the Porsche came from or who it belonged to. The boy told his dad it was his. Now his dad knew he couldn't afford it so he also didn't believe it when his son told him he only paid $75 for the car. He took his son back to the person that sold it to him to get to the bottom of the whole thing.  Turns out that the woman's husband left her and phoned her telling her that it was over and that the only thing he wanted from the separation was the money she got for selling his car... So she sold it for $75    So, you never know.  Does it have a clear title or is it a rebuilt title? etc.    then again maybe it is a misprint and they want $7200 or $12,700|`|wqeAeSVYaa	scam.|`|69b28c895ecbe3f5e0fc99326c84d73faa	It is more than likely a misprint.

meqrA9ZZaa	I presume we only talk collision safety, a lot of stuff can help you avoid a collision in the first place, and thus increase safety, but I won't discuss that in this post.    Practically any detail affect safety. There are the obvious pieces of safety equipment like seat belt and air bags, but just as important is the overall design of the vehicle to crumble correctly. The key to avoiding injury is to make the acceleration of the passengers smooth, imagine driving head on into a concrete wall in a tank at high speed, the body of the tank might be relatively unharmed, but the passengers would be stopped inside the vehicle almost instantly, thus an enormous acceleration in very short time, that could be lethal.    That is why car designers work with crumble zones, rather than the car stopping immediately areas of the car that do not contain passengers should when a suitably high force is applied begin to crumble as to not stop the car immediately but rather take the speed out gradually. Around the passengers you would want a relatively hard "shell" to prevent stuff from hurting the passengers directly, but further out the car should be softer to make shure that the shell is not accelerated instantly. Everything in a crumble zone must be able to crumble, if it doesn't it could make it's way into the cabin and hurt the passengers. The classic to mention here is the steering column, hard iron pipe extending horizontally from the front of the car to the driver seat, set for killing at just medium speed collisions. Modern steering columns are made to break when they need to.    Crumble zones should however not be too soft, as they in that case won't be able to brake the car enough before they are "spent". There is no single optimal softness for designing a car, as different speeds of collision have different impact. Thus racing cars for instance are designed to be much harder as they are generally expected to crash at higher speeds than normal cars.    There is a lot of stuff that I haven't mentioned, but basically anything in a car, including what the passengers have brought themselves could potentially be the spearhead for a kill, or the crumble strength adjustment that saves a life.    Practically, when buying a car, taking a look at the Euro NCAP report is probably a lot better than trying to estimate if it will crumble well ;-) I know a lot of american cars don't undergo the test, but frankly, there is often a reason on top of the price for them to skip the NCAP.

uFQFRdczaa	If your transmission is putting less power than it used to, start saving your sheckels because it's getting ready to fail.    The Blazer's slow response isn't because of 4wd, it's because of its power-to-weight ratio.  A 195 hp engine pulling a 4,000 lb vehicle is not going to win drag races.  So your choices are shave off weight and increase power.    The biggest, baddest thing you can do to increase power in an s10 is a V8 swap.  You can fit a 350 (a 5.7, for the metric crowd) where the 4.3 engine used to be, all you need is the V8 motor mounts, custom headers, and a lot of hours in the shop.  If you drop in a power-built supercharged V8, you could be looking towards 600 hp.|`|QdzecSwdaa	Do a tune up  plugs, wires, rotor button, distributor cap.

dCuWCbRkaa	Wow, no American cars and preferably Audi or BMW?  I sure hope you live in Europe...    Getting an Audi or BMW in your price range means that it would be an early or mid nineties car, which will be old, gas is probably bad, and you're more likely to encounter problems.    Check out the Ford Focus.  Seriously, even though I might seem like I am polarized towards American cars, they really are on par with, if not better, than Asian companies.  The Focus will be great on gas, and there's lots of different models depending on what you want/need (4-door, coupe, sport/racing)|`|PnMtlZ0Yaa	You want something reliable. Buy from an adult who properly maintained the car. Try to find a car that is in stock condition with no modifications beyond a stereo. Run a carfax report on it- the less owners the better, and no major accidents. Have a mechanic look at it before the cash leaves your hand.      BMW maintenance on an older car is not as bad as people say it is, and I bought a few in your price range to speak from experience. (Always avoid the dealer service!) A Toyota is a good choice, too. Be sure to not spend all the money on the initial purchase so you have some left over for tires and a tuneup.

XLXncQu9aa	That depends.  Head on collisions can be deadly but there are several factors to think about in that kind of scenario.      *The first is th speed.  55 mph is a fast speed, however the faster you go the more damage there will on impact.  Its the simple laws of physics.  The slower the car crash the less damage done.  The faster the car crash the more impact there is.  55 mph is a stable speed and it would sustain a considerable amount of damage.      *Weight of vehicle.  It also depends on the weight of each vehicle involved.  If a small car hits head on with a truck, then the car will likely be totaled because the truck weighed more than the car.  If you mix the speed with the weight of the truck you have a massive collision for the car.      *Also if the driver was in a seat belt or not.  If the driver was not in a seat belt, then the chance of surviving is greatly diminished.  The seat belt has the purpose of restraining a driver in the event of a crash.  If you take that out of the equation then you may or may not survive.      *Finally there is the issue of the air bag.  In some cases air bags have been known to deploy at high speeds actually killing the individual.  The higher the speed of impact the higher the speed for deployment of the air bag which could prove fatal.      Based on all of these factors, it is all a game of chance.  The more variations you have, the more the chance of injury and possibly death there is.|`|WO68RZdIaa	The rule of thumb is when both cars are traveling at 55 MPH when they hit, the damage is equivalent as you hitting a solid wall at 110 MPH.    With the modern cars having crumple zones, impact bumpers, airbags & other safety features- I don't really think that this rule is as accurate today as it was in the past, so the actual impact damage may be less than 110 on today's cars.  But, it will still all depend on the amount of safety features, whether or not a seat belt was correctly used & the weights of the vehicles.|`|AT0e3xwAaa	Depends on what car you are in and what car you collide with. Say you are in a modern car with air bags and you hit another modern car with air bags, Chances are 50/50 at that speed.

Passengers who are 13 or older have a 27% better chance of surviving a head-on collision in an airbag equipped car in a car without air bags.|`|crnlNsS1aa	A head on collision is considerable more survivable then a drive side impact in a t-bone. there is more room for the car to absorb some of the energy. if you are in modern car with a seat belt I would put you with at lest a 75% survivability rate. no seat belt and i'd say less then 50%.
YgHxMF4Uaa	when u push the gas pedal u spend more gas. The less u push, the more efficient.   If u want to be extremly gas efficient:  1 as the rpm rises ur power rises. Low rpm lack of power engine struggle.at one point u feel the power starts kicking in. U feel that point. That's for crusing little below, I suppose at ur car, around2700- 2800 rpm  2. If u have to go up hill while on flat get little speed pushing gas slow. As u go up hill u release the gas pedal slow, u keep it enough to sustain the car, as u go up at one point u have to change the gear.  3 down hill u can pull it off gear, run on ideling... Watch out on steep hills u burn the brakes   4 stay behind large vehicles, trucks, friction with air takes a lot  5 look ahead stop signs lights, prepare the stop from longer distance. The less u push the brake the less u spend... Strange? I let the car run on idle when I can...less brakes means less starts less gas... U spend a lot while starting the moving of car  6 when u start do not rush, takes it slow as the car feels like|`|H8XpaaPDaa	i've been wondering this too and i THINK its a combination of both rpm and throttle position.    because technically, if you would push the throttle farther, you would be accelerating, or trying to, and you use more gas when trying to accelerate.    but i could be wrong....we'll see      edit: lol maybe this is something for the mythbusters to solve?!?!?!|`|xSzSBH6haa	going up the hill faster actually would get better fuel usage, as going fast the enging is breathing well and alot of air flow is passing thru the intake so the more air/fuel mix the better the performance , when you are dogging /  lugging the engine, it uses more fuel and less air, therefore getting worse fuel usage,put a k&n airfilter in it and you will be really impressed, it will double your air flow and mileage,paying for its self in 2 months or less because of the fuel mileage savings,not to mention the get up and go it will have

Dream on kiddo..|`|6mLhiSXuaa	No luck on the supercharger, if you want a reputable one (dinan, AA), you're looking at 10K plus. Like I said before, 4k is a lot of money, but not when you want to mod a new BMW, correctly. Check out these websites I'm tossing in the bottom, find stuff that interests you.     Software: Shark Injector, Dinan. Will gain you around 5 hp to the wheels, but increases throttle response (car feels quicker). Cost: $400. Dinan has the name brand advantage, and will help when you sell the car.  Intake: K&N, Dinan, AFE. Again, Dinan has name brand advantage, but will run you around $1500. the others cost around $450, and will get you the same power, about 5-8 hp.  Exhaust: Do something custom. Take off you muffler, and replace it with a magnaflow can. Won't really help power much, but will sound better.  I know we've said it before, but this isn't a performance car, look for other upgrads like this:  Drilled and slotted rotors: help improve braking, last longer, look SWEET.  Hawk Brake pads: improve braking, last longer  Stainless brake lines: improve braking, last forever.  Caliper paint: just looks cool, costs about $35 on Ebay.  Lose weight: Not you, the car. Take out the rear seats if you don't need them. Losing 60 lbs is like gaining 5 hp.  Tires: better tires make the car feel like an entirely different animal. I love my Nitto Invo!    I'm building up a 2000 M5 on a college kid budget. You don't need the name brand stuff, or pre made stuff to get a good product. My $80 exhaust sounds better than the one's people are shelling out $2300 for!   If I was in your boat, I'd go with the Dinan Software, AFE intake, custom exhaust, and upgrade the brakes. The brake mods I listed is what's going on my m5 in the next week.|`|6ypXMb1jaa	Get your dad to have it souped up. Why not? Obviously he's crazy enough to buy you an outrageous gift like that.

BgwTxzEFaa	Take off the gas cap and listen into the tank while someone turns the key, if you dont hear the fuel pump, you may need a fuel pump.    Pop the hood, and pull off one end of one of the spark plug wires (the end that attaches to the spark plug) and place the end near the engine block (something metal on it) and crank the engine in a dark place, If you dont see a spark, you may have a problem with the ignition system.

And just because you hear it running, does not mean its working like it should. A pressure test must be performed. Needs around 60 psi constant pressure at manifold.

The fuel pump should be inside the gas tank and is hard to get at and expensive, so hope that is not the problem.|`|K4f9QQj4aa	mayb its the alternator
XKYJk6Tcaa	on new cars these days they have what is called a two part paint system. that means a base coat which is your color and a clear coat which makes it shine. If you are not familiar with painting and detailing my advice is take it to a detail shop they can remove the scratch for you but if it goes into the base coat they may have to spot paint it. if you can catch your fingernail in the scratch then it has gone pretty deep and need a professional to take care of it. like I said if your not familiar with the paint systems take it to the detail shop.|`|bmoCpcdraa	buff it out|`|H0LfFGmlaa	Get touch up paint|`|gAOAdOHraa	Not sure about that product, but I know that sometimes if the scratch isn't too deep it may simply buff out.

0B0ycKw3aa	Hello new driver :)    If you are a young driver attempting to find cheap and affordable car insurance you are probably already aware of the challenge that lies ahead. The statistics about teenage drivers arent good. According to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS), 16-year-olds get into accidents almost six times more often than drivers between the age of 30 and 59. No wonder car insurance premiums are so high for this age group. It has always been difficult if you are aged between of 16 - 25 to insure your car affordably, and although car insurance companies are beginning to recognize the need to supply this ever expanding market, it can still prove to be hard to find a reasonably priced car insurance premium.    For instance, young drivers will often own older or less maintained vehicle compared to other drivers, which means they are more likely to break down and potentially cause an accident. Teenage drivers are also more likely to have accidents which can either injure themselves or the other party.    However, parents should be aware if the fact that there are several ways that can help lower car insurance costs for your teen. In order for teen drivers and car insurance to work well together, parents need to know the factors that will help contribute to paying less for their son or daughters auto insurance in the future.    The first thing that insurance providers look into when giving a car insurance quote is the driving record of the person. Teenagers that have a good driving record may merit consideration. What that means is that you can help keep your teen focused on safe driving by having him or her pay a portion of the auto insurance premium. Also, be sure to let your teen know the consequences of getting traffic tickets.    Before you purchase your car it is also worth researching which insurance group it will fall in, so that you can ensure you will be able to get the cheapest possible insurance.    Finally, by using Insurance4lessdirect.com you can rest assured that we will strive to find you the cheapest car insurance premium that will provide you and your teenager with the best cover.    Did you know: If youre adding your teen driver to your auto insurance policy, be sure to take advantage of the auto insurance discount for good students, available in many states.    For quick and free 50 state insurance quote comaprison visit: http://www.insurance4lessdirect.com.    Don't forget to talk to your parents too.    Good luck :)|`|vkYDOVIdaa	autoinsurance.undonet.com - check this one. As I remember they have lowest car insurance rates for teens and young drivers.|`|ypk3jQgjaa	Have your dad or mom sign as the primary driver and it goes way down!|`|2lQoDdjqaa	The best you can hope for as a young driver is to get a car you can carry only liability coverage on (i.e. - paid for).

AA12051696	only 6k miles? thats nothin. yeah more miles will wear down an engine faster, but as long as you keep up to date on your oil changes, you should be fine. youll need to change the trans fluid earlier if youre doing a lot of heavy pulling or uphill driving as this ill burn up trans fluid faster. other than that, just basic preventative maintenance.|`|140b1c561177bc5cc3baf4ae5b15a6a8aa	Average mileage for a driver in the USA is about 15,000 miles per year. You are on target for 1,200 miles per month, or 14,400 per year.    Change your oil regularly, lube the chassis, and have your mechanic check brakes regularly. Rotate your tires every 5,000 miles (every other oil change is a good time).     Find a good maintenance mechanic, and he'll keep your car in good shape for you.|`|ypk3jQgjaa	Take good care of it.

And Ford will consider it a normal characteristic of the vehicle line and offer no repair is necessary for us technicians, and that vehicle durability is not affected.  Honestly, that is almost word for word what we will see on the tech website.  If they can't find it, and there are no messages on it and other vehicles do it, not much the dealer is going to do to solve it.  Keep driving.  When they have an answer, we will let you know.

Let me rephrase the last bit then, so some, especially those that post just to call names and not actually answer anything, can understand.  It is a new model vehicle and there will not be any service messages until the vehicle has been on the market for a while.

K3YDHE2qaa	Consider the 1999-2002 Honda Accord Coupe.  It was, and still is, a good looking car, it is a Honda which means it will last, and the price will be decent here in 2009.  The only thing is - is that it only has 200hp, which was good at the time, but today is something more of a joke.  That said, if you want more power it is a Honda so you can buy cheap power by way of a turbo, etc.  Another option from that time is also the last generation Honda Prelude which still looks amazing but has the same HP issue.      Alternatively, the Subaru WRX was released around that time so look into those.  However, personal opinion... the first generation WRX with those circular headlights were ugly as sin.  The Maxima from the same time was mentioned, at that series came with 258hp so it will be rather quick and it still looks decent.    Hope that helps.|`|yJejlLq1aa	They all look the same.
