20090205084221AALDcqr	Pets;Dogs	How do you contain or limit your dog's area of play?	I have two dogs. One is a slightly neurotic Rottie. She runs up and down the fence line, antagonizing the neighbor's dog, to the point that the grass is gone and replaced by mud. The sprinkler line under her path is now exposed.   I am looking into methods to keep her from running back and forth for hours at a time and to keep her out of the area that now needs new sod and a new sprinkler line. I do play with her and take her on walks. This "fence running" is more of an obsession for her.   Electric fence? Hotwire? Invisible fence/shock collars? What methods do you use or suggest?

20090205084316AADBurV	Pets;Fish	My question is about honey sunset gouramis?	I got one honey sunset gourami for my 30 gallon tank. At fist it seemed to be doing fine. I was planning to get another one when I got paid. She started acting strange and wouldn't eat the flake food and just sitting in the corner not even swimming around. I thought maybe they needed fish of their own kind because when she would move around she would follow the silver hatchets around. I left to go get another gourami. As soon as I returned with her friend she was dying. I had two new fish so I wasn't sure what to do. If she has some sort of disease there was nothing I could do because I had two new fish in bags. I put them in the tank. I tested the water and everything is normal. There doesn't appear to be any disease on any of the fish including the one that died. Also, I said she wasn't eating but it hadn't been enough time for her to have starved. Why would she die?       and the snail I have in my tank began to feed on her. Now the snail seems sick and has some white stuff all over it. I also added aquarium salt when I did a water change right after the fish died. Could the snail be sick from the salt?      Anyway the new Gourami is just sitting around now not doing much. She ate yesterday but I haven't tried today. They seem very stubborn about eating. Any tips?
20090205084627AAmvrqW	Pets;Fish	Which Live Rock For 10gal Saltwater Aquarium?	Ok, I am setting up a small 10 gallon aquarium 9harder work than larger ones I know), so right now I have the water in, salt mixed in 2 days ago, and the sand is in with a penguin 100 filter and a small heater.      Now, the water is a bit cloudy, but it has only been running for 3 or 4 days, so that should settle down, but I need to know what kind of live rock to get for this 10gal tank, how big, and what I should expect to pay.  Online the prices for live rock are ridiculous....$300?, $400??? You have got to be kidding me.  Why is it so expensive.      Also, what else do I need? One guy said to get a Peppermint Shrimp for my Live Rock to eat all the parasites.  There is no fish or anything in the tank right now, just what I mentioned above, so is a live rock the next step? If not, then what is. THANKS!!

20090205084620AAF9d0F	Pets;Dogs	We found out our puppy has ringworm?	we have given him back to the people we got him from because we don't want our young daughter or cat to get the ringworm.  I have a few questions I am hoping someone can answer.  I have read the spores can live a long time. We plan on cleaning our carpets tomorrow (he was only with us for 5 days) will that eliminate the spores? Will we be able to get another dog without the risk of him getting ringworm from our house? The puppy rolled around in the dirt in the back yard, does that mean our backyard is now contaminated? Will our cat get ringworm just by walking and laying on the carpet where the puppy was?   The owners that we gave the puppy back to said that they would get it cleared up and that we could have the puppy back if we wanted. Should we risk it and take the puppy back when he is better or will he always be a carrier? He comes from a horse farm and all the other puppies have it as well.   Thank you for any info.

20090205085622AAFi9qz	Pets;Other - Pets	Does it make you cry when people hurt animals?	Does it make you cry when people hurt animals?      I always cry when I see animals being abused or hurt or neglected. I know I am a man ad men aren't supposed to cry over those things, but it just hearts my heart to see a defenceless animal hurt.      I was watching a show about the 10 Greatest Escapes from Natural Disasters and one of them involved an animal. A couple in Australia were out on a yacht with their dog when they struck something and the yacht began to sink. They radioed and a helicopter came to get them out of the situation. However, the man doing the rescuing wanted to leave the dog to drown. They had the entire thing on videotape for training purpose, not a recreation. You could see the dog trying to stand on the portion of the yacht that was left above water and when it sank you could see it trying to stay above water. It just broke my heart. The family kept crying that this dog was a member of their family and that it needed to be saved, but the guy was only going to save it if he had a good chance.   The dog was eventually saved, and I cried tears of joy. I would have been so angry if she had drowned. But I was appalled by the fact that this guy didn't think the dog was worth saving. I mean obviously the dog was enough of a member of the family to be taken out on a yacht.      What are your thoughts?

He is my family's first dog that we got about 5 years ago. Over the years, he started to gain weight from the family feeding him too much (my dad and i don't feed him table scraps anymore whatsoever) but my mom continues to feed him junk!! Whether it be leftovers or scraps...catfood....anything! She won't stop! (we also have a jack russell and a australian shepherd she does this to) At his last vet visit, he weighed 135 pounds!!      We play with him outside and take him out to the lake every once in a while during the summer, but nothing seems to help him to lose weight. I want to exercise him more, but I'm afraid to sometimes after a family friend's dog died (who was also obese) from an overworked heart after summer swim.      I know about the problems black labs can get with their hips and knees, and I know about other complications he could get. That's why I really need to do something!! I don't want him to die before he should, because he's my first dog and my companion!!      Any suggestions to help him lose weight??

20090205092801AAgsKEE	Pets;Cats	I'm getting a kitten. Need some tips please? 10 points?	Hi everyone.       I am going to get a kitten in around 6 weeks, from this lady (my dad's colleague) who's cat had kittens. (please dont lecture me about getting a cat from a rescue center, I alredy have a 6 year old cat, who we adopted when I was 7). Now im 13. The lady is desperate to find homes for the kittens, and I wanted a kitten too, as I am an animal lover! She said we could go and see the kittens next week, but they are too young to know what gender they are. Our family cat sleeps on my mum and dads bed, and I would love it if this kitten could sleep with me. I am sure our cat will get on fine with the kitten, as whenever my aunty comes to visit for the weekend she brings her 2 kittens, and my cat just loves to play with them...even since the first day they visited. Anyways, the cat's litter tray is on the middle landing of our stairs. Basicly you go up 7 steps, there is a smallish landing, around the size of a large couch, probably a little larger. From that landing you go up another 6 steps and our 3 bedrooms are there, and that landing isnt big enough for another litter tray. I am planning on keeping the kitten in my room at night, but how will it be able to get to the litter tray? Can young kittens get down and up stairs? There is no way I could keep a litter tray in my bedroom, and the bathroom is downstairs. I dont want the kitten alone all night, but if it has an accident in my bedroom I would just die on the spot lol. (I will be getting the kitten at around 11 weeks so it will be litter trained)   How do i settle the kitten?    How do I introduce the kitten to the family cat?   I have already bought the kitten her own cat tree with 4 levels. Our cat also has her own one. I also bought the kitten a box full of toys, like a long fluffy thing attatched to a stick, and you pull it along the floor, my cat also loves those, some jingly balls, some toy mice full of catnip, a fuzzy mouse on a string, a cat fishing toy thing and stuff like that. What else should I get for it?   I know I need food bowls, I just use the disposible kind, as it's a lot easyer to just pick up and throw away the whole thing when the cat has finished eating, than washing it every meal.    A collar   What else do you suggest I do?      sorry its so long and boring, im just excited.

20090205095458AAZBsaG	Pets;Dogs	What would you do in this situation?	I was looking on a breeder website planning to buy a puppy.  He had one litter that was born and two more due within the next two weeks.  I wasn't sure about any of the pups from the first litter so I waited for the second to be posted.  Still not sure about any of them I waited for the thrid to be posted.  When the third litter was posted I realized that they took a male and female from the first breeding and posted it onto the thrid breeding.  Then I noticed they took a female from the second breeding and posted it on the third breeding.  Now, the first two breedings were with a different stud dog and totally different bloodlines than the thrid.  The dogs from the first two breedings were APBR/CKC registered.  The thrid were ADBA.  So, they can make more off the third breeding.  I contacted them and told them I knew what they had done and then contacted ADBA to give them a heads up that some of the pups that were being registered were not sired by the said male.     What would you do in this situation?  Let it go and not say anything?  Would you have done the same?  I had a lot of respect for these people and thought they were very reputable breeders.

La sua storia è stata molto triste...la vera prorpietaria dopo averlo affidato due volte, per l'ennesima volta glielo hanno restituito. L'ultima persona che ce l' ha avuto non gli ha restituito il pedigree che oltretutto è rimasto intestato a quest'ultima. io non ho mai avuto cani con pedigree anche se di razza, quindi chiedo se un giorno con quel pedigree la persona che ce lo ha intestato possa venire da me a rivendicare il possesso del cane?Come mi devo comportare? Grazie in anticipo!

20070430130901AAdyuG2	Pets;Cats	Kitten passing blood in urine?	I have a six week old kitten - originally meant to collect at 8 weeks but the woman who had him wasnt being at all nice. He has been with us for 6 days and has been checked out and wormed by a vet. Last night i noticed he passed blood in his urine and today he seems to want to go a lot without much success. The bleeding has gone but it scared me. He doesnt drink a lot but i give him kitten pouch moist food and have tried the cat milk to encourage him to drink. Im worried he may not be getting enough to drink and having something like cystitus. Hes fine in every other way and doesnt seem to be in any discomfort when trying to wee. I rang my vets today and they said keep an eye on him and if he passes any more blood then bring him in for a check up. Has anyone else had an experience like this? Not sure if its ususal for a cat to wee a lot, or at least keep going back to the litter box. He is only six weeks old but we love him and want the best for him. What do you think?

20070710194442AAufUw3	Pets;Cats	My cat never purrs?	Hello.      Whilst I'm very positive my cat loves me, he never purrs. Most people say when a cat purrs, it means it is happy. I feed and play with my cat all the time. (I really wish I had another cat, so my cat could play with it, but my parents will not permit it)      I really want him to be happy and purr. For some reason, the sound of him purring makes me happy. :P But he rarely does it. I believe the only time he really purrs is when his food bowl is almost empty and he brushes up against my leg and OCCASIONALLY purrs, asking for more food.      He also never really brushes up against my leg or anything. He never likes to be picked up or held. I received him when I was eleven, and I am now thirteen, so I have owned him for nearly two years.      Is there any way I can make him happy? Also, is my cat not purring regarded as unusual?      Thank you for reading.

20070719135300AApIbpm	Pets;Dogs	Is this a good idea or a bad one?	So i purchased a rawhide 3pk beef flavored chews for my 4 month old daschund. They are more specifically called Exer-Hides. They say its safe and natural way to satisfy your dog's chewing needs. and Also helps in reducing tartar build up and preventing gum disease. So i gave it to her last night and she refused to do anything else. She would not chase her toy to play fetch like usual or go outside to pee. She chewed on her bone eventually till i took it away and from then she looked for it everywhere. She searched and sniffed my whole place looking for her bone. I think shes obssessed with it. Should i let her finish it off or never give it her?

She is a small dog of 24 pounds but she is a toy murderer.      She even ripped apart her Kong.      We learned quickly to not allow her to have soft toys or non durable toys but it just seems she rips them all apart in minutes.      She has a hard rubber toy in the shape of a horse shoe that she hasn't destroyed (Because she won't touch it)      She has destroyed 2 tennis balls we got at the pet store.      It seems all we can give her these days is chew bones (and thats not that good)      What can we give her that will last?

I hate doing that because she constantly pulls on the chain, I'm afraid that it will damage her neck. We have to use a choke chain because if we just hooked the chain on her collar she will simply chew off the collar (same with a harness as well) and get out.

20090205101417AA1VO6m	Pets;Dogs	My neighbor has a Pug...?	She has had this dog for about 3 months or so now and it is constantly barking and growling at everyone.       It'll stand at the door when she's not home and just bark for hours on end and it'll do the same when she is home... I've been able to, for the most part ignore it, but I know that it's driving the old lady that lives downstairs from her nuts (and she's on the verge of reporting it) and he's driving the woman that owns him nuts as well... She's losing sleep because of his barking and bad behavior.      I've offered her some advice on how to train her dog recently.. Positive reinforcement techniques like telling him "No" once when he starts barking and then completely ignoring him until he stops, at which point she gives him positive attention because I've noticed that when he starts, she tries to correct the behavior over and over again and, every time, he'll look at her for a second and continue to do it.      He jumps around and growls and barks every time that I walk out of my apartment, every time that someone walks by on the sidewalk outside... He's an incredibly annoying, untrained little brat, to be honest... But as with any dog, I know that he can be taught to be a good dog. I'm wondering if anyone else has some advice for me to give my neighbor... She was very thankful when I gave her the little bit that I did and I'm sure that she'd appreciate more. She's constantly commenting on how well behaved my dog is and I can tell that she loves her dog, but his behavior is starting to get to her.

I've received 2 quotes for surgery and I'm wondering what is reasonable as finances are a concern. First quote was in the $2500 range and second was a minimum of $3000. Are these prices reasonable?

20090205110154AAcjUuq	Pets;Dogs	Is all hope gone for this pup to be housebroke?	Two months ago I took in a small mixed breed puppy that a friend was going to take to the pound because he could not get him potty trained. I figured he wasnt trying hard enough and so we took him in. He is now 6 months old and I am starting to wonder if he is just too old to learn not that he has been peeing and pooping inside his whole life. I want to start crate training over, but wanted to see what everyone else thought. I do take him out on a leash every 2-3 hours. Its too cold to leave him out alone and hes too small to be an outside dog. Please no rude comments.  Also, he has an appt next week to get neutered.

With the few gas stops and additional stops to walk my dog, the trip will take about 13-15 hours by car.  My dog does fine and has actually made the trip a few times already.  I am concerned about the cats though.  They will both be in separate medium sized plastic carriers w/ little water dishes.  It is a long trip, but I have to make it and I will be in a roomy SUV.    I was wondering if anyone has experience w/ a kitty Valium or if there is such a thing available.  And if so, how much does it cost and how long does it work for?

20090205112753AAkNXxe	Pets;Dogs	Bulldog puppy plays too rough with older bulldog?	We have a 1 yr old bulldog who is very playful with other dogs and people.  We recently got another 2mth old bulldog puppy.  The two boys play pretty rough together.  I've found little bleeding scratches on the older bulldog's face from the puppy's bites.  When they are playing too rough, we separate them.  There is no growling or snarling and they do seem to be genuinely enjoying themselves.  Even when the puppy bites the older dog's mouth, the older dog doesn't seem to mind and he continues to play as well.  I want them to get along more than anything and I don't want the puppy to grow up to be aggressive...any suggestions?

Looked well. Though i think it was the large litter.       I am feeding them, all milk from an eye dropper. Today i have fed them 14 times. 3 of them, normally drink about 5-6 amounts. Though one of them, drinks one. I have been feeding them fluently because i don't want them to die. I have alalfa hay, mixed in with some celery and pellets. The are eating a little of that. I heard that alalfa hay is good for pregnant and baby guinea pigs.       Is there something wrong with one of the little boys ?       oh, and they look oily.    I don't know if its just their fur type, or if its the milk ?    I was thinking because this only happened when the mother wasn't there, that she might groom them ? And that's why they are oily.        Im not sure.    They seem very Sad, Tired. And lonely. Another one of my guinea pigs gave birth 1 hour after the first. She had three babies. I have tried putting them together, and letting maya look after them, but after watching her for 5 Min's she was sick of 7 babies running around. I didn't know what to do. Though they seem okay.       Oh, and when do they stop drinking milk ? Because normally stop when they are ready though, i don't know. Normally mother would. Is it three weeks ? Two? what ?       please help.    I know breeding can end up in bad places.    Though it may sound wierd it was a health problem. For another guinea pig and saved his life.       Thanks for answers.

A few months ago my cat had to have all his teeth out because of gingivitis, he is so much better now, but the vet left some roots in and they've been causing pain, so he's going for an operation tomorrow to have them removed. He's been on metacam, a painkiller for cats and has had 3.5mg per day. When I got up this morning he'd pooed in the kitchen (something he's never done before) and there was a bit of blood in it. I called the vet and told them about this but they didn't seem too worried and said just bring him tomorrow for his operation. later on this morning he 'dabbed' my son who was playing with his toy cars. My cat has never done this before and I'm worried about his bleeding, his op and his temper. Could he be cross because of the pain? Do you think he'll be ok?

20090205114625AAPunkQ	Pets;Cats	Why does my cat act like this?	I have a cat called Tinkerbell that I have owned since she was a kitten, and she is going to be 7 years old in April (on the Queen Of England's birthday) and she was such an adorable, social kitten who loved to play. Now, she has grown into a monster, if I stroke her, she slinks away from my hand, and if I pick her up, she starts growling and spitting at me, scratching and biting! I very rarely pick her up and she has in no way been neglected. When I call her name, she completely ignores me. Another strange habit that she seems to have is that if I stroke her, when she thinks I am not looking at her, she will wash in the spot where I touched her! Is she just a moody, unfriendly cat? Or is there a reason behind it?

We definatley do not need idiots running around that think that every comment and question that attacks some idea, or pokes fun at certain things to be abuse. Then..these same "offended" people curse at you without taking in consideration that they could be offending other people with their languauge.    I would like to seek out these people and hit them with heavy bats until they see the error of their ways, or until I am satisfied anyway.      By the way, here is my silly, stupid poem/question that had so many "concerned" people cursing at me.       http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...       Now, is your first conclusion that I may have to much free time on my hands, that I am retarded or that I actually have a pit bull bleeding on my carpet?      Please let me know, much appreciated!!

20090203030141AA7oiOs	Pets;Dogs	Ideas for nervous rescue dog?	We have a rescued border terrier female of about 3, been with us nearly a year. I think she is of nervous temperament anyway but was obviously also beaten. As long as you are always calm and always there, she is great. But life isn't quite like that! Any attempt to train sends her neurotic, crouching and skulking around. If you call her with an unintended harsh note in your voice, she crawls to you with her belly on the ground. Would a dog friend help? Any other ideas? I tried a dog trainer but he was of the 'just be the alpha' school which really doesn't help with a dog like this. Thanks.
20090203032936AAanTsY	Pets;Cats	Can infer red hurt cats eyes?	I have a laser pointer, Now, I do not think it is a REAL INFERRED light since I have done the "cigarette test" which it has failed. (For those who do not know, this "test" consists of pointing the inferred light at your cigarette about 3" away, after about 30sec - 1min it is supposed to light the cigarette, with the help of you puffing on it)  Since it failed this test, I highly doubt it is a REAL INFERRED LIGHT. With that said, I and my family, all get a kick out of pointing the light on the floor, ceiling, and walls and watching our beloved cat "RZA" go nuts, chasing this light around the house. Now, although it is hilarious, and extremely entertaining, to say the least, I hope it is not harming our Cat's eyes, or confusing their brain so much into a harmful level in which passes the humour and enjoyment. We are so against animal abuse, this is why I am posting this, to be sure we are not harming "RZA" in any way...
