20090227150559AAB2XDv	Food & Drink;Cooking & Recipes	Which recipe would taste better?	Dim Sums Ingredients      1 3/4 lb ground meat          BASIC MIX:    2 eggs   3 Tbs sherry   3 Tbs soy sauce   2 Tbs sesame oil    2 Tbs corn starch   1/2 tsp white pepper   3 clove garlic minced   1 tsp grated fresh ginger    3 chopped little green onions    4 Tbs chopped water chestnut       EXTRA CONDIMENTS:    3 tsp hosin sauce   1 tsp grated orange peel   2 tsp spicy brown bean sauce    1 1/2 tsp red chili sauce with garlic       WRAPPER:    1 package wonton skins               Dim Sums Method         In a large bowl mix meat well with basic ingredients and mix until smooth. Separate mix into four equal parts. For each part add one of the extra condiments mix well. To stuff the dumplings put about one overflowing teaspoon or pecan sized ball into a wonton skin. Fold into shape. Parts of the wonton skin that are sticking out may get tough so keep this to a minimum. Use a different shape for each condiment so that you will know what is what. To cook place on top of lettuce leaf on steam rack, the leaf helps prevent sticking. Be very careful not to let them touch each other or else they will stick. Steam for 20 minutes. Eat the Dim Sums hot.       ------------------------OR------------...      For Dumplings   1/2 lb ground pork    3 green onions, finely chopped    1 garlic clove, minced    1/4 teaspoon sesame oil    salt and pepper    1 (12 ounce) package dumpling wrappers or wonton wrappers, about 20    For Sauce   1/4 cup soy sauce    1 tablespoon rice vinegar    1 tablespoon hoisin sauce (or more to taste)    1/4 teaspoon sesame oil    2 teaspoons sugar    2 teaspoons peanut oil or sunflower oil    2 garlic cloves, minced    1/2 teaspoon grated ginger (or more to taste)    3 tablespoons water (optional)    1 tablespoon cornstarch (optional)       Directions   1 In a small bowl combine pork, onions, garlic, sesame oil, salt and pepper.    2 Fill each wrap with a small spoonful of the pork mixture and seal with water, pressing edges and folding a bit to "ruffle" them.    3 Heat water to boiling, and place bamboo steamer (or sieve) lined with a large cabbage or lettuce leaf (to prevent sticking) over the pot.    4 Reduce heat to medium.    5 Place dumplings in a single layer (not touching each other) on leaf, cover and steam for 20 minutes or so--until cooked through.    6 Meanwhile, make sauce.    7 In a small bowl, mix soy sauce, vinegar, hoisin, sesame oil and sugar; set aside.    8 In a small sauce pan, heat oil, and sauté garlic and ginger until barely golden.    9 Add soy mixture and heat through.    10 If desired, whisk cornstarch and water to make a slurry and use this to thicken the sauce.    11 Thickening the sauce allows for better coating of the dumplings while dipping, but is not necessary.    12 Garnish with chopped green onions and sesame seeds.    13 Serve hot dumplings with sauce.

Alright, last night we had a whole chicken for dinner, there a quite a bit of left overs and I was thinking of making some kind of soup from it for tonight.

I'd love to maybe make some homemade noodles but have no clue how. Not even sure to begin with just the chicken... If anyone has ideas other then soup I am open to them.... Thanks =)

20090309145447AAMtjVR	Food & Drink;Non-Alcoholic Drinks	Are restaurants required to serve tap water?	I'm really only interested in answers that apply to the state of California.  Thank you.      I went to a Mexican restaurant near a university yesterday and ordered food.  I asked for a cup of water, because I didnt want to buy a soda.  The lady behind the counter told me that they do not serve tap water, but I was free to buy a bottle of water.        I asked why they do this, and they answered that they are trying to curb underage drinking, because they are well known around campus for their deals on pitchers of beer.  They dont want to give a water cup to someone who is underage, and then the person just uses it for the beer. So now they ID for cups.  I asked her if I could show my ID (because I'm over 21) and then get a water cup, and she responded that I would get a cup, but they still no longer serve tap water.         Is this legal??  I dont care about PAYING for tap water, but in a place that serves alcohol, arent they required to provide water?  Water bottles arent unlimited... tap water would be.
