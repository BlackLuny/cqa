To compete, richer nations will have to become poorer by lowering wages and giving fewer benefits to compete.|`|rVPrhd26aa	here's a cartoon I animated about buying foreign goods<br>  <a href="http://i113.photobucket.com/albums/n203/StiggieVandell/BABYEPISODETWO.gif" rel="nofollow">http://i113.photobucket.com/albums/n203/...</a>|`|CPWrxvE5aa	the winners and losers are on both sides..the winners in one sense are the people getting the clothes at a cheaper price due to the clothes being made in a foreign country...but they are also the losers due to the jobs going to that same foreign country. On the other side of the world...the winners are the people who got jobs at the factory that opened up in their country that use to be located in the USA...but they are also the losers due to getting low, very low pay and working extremely long hours. The blade cuts both ways...many people in those countries know they cannot afford the products they are making. So it goes in the world today...the companies in the USA are looking for cheap labor where they do not have to pay dental or medical and do not have to worry about vacation days for their employee's...while knowing that in those foreign countries they are getting 3 people for the price of 1 in the USA and they do not have to worry about the peoples health cost at all due to not having to pay for it..plus they know they can work these people to the bone and then some with little complaints or anything.|`|OtKCAeQZaa	There are many originations that pay below the legal limit of payment for work .These people are in desperate situations that they can not get out of , The world today take advantage of the low-cost of making cheep clothing on the expenses of the poor and this need to stop, were is equality today. Why do so many that get rich, suffer the poor to have nothing when they have all they need and more, this is an evil in our world today. And unless people speak up concerning this nothing will be done to stop it. Poverty is being taken advantage of by the rich only to suffer the poor for there own greed .
FKDv6ycbaa	the global cooling has kept the bug life down thankfully, please dont send al gore any money or he will bring back GW and the insects.|`|t1zlbOURaa	Same way it effects Tinkerbell's aerodynamics.|`|zince8g1aa	Regarding pine beetles...<br>  <br>  "The mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins, Coleoptera: Curculionidae, Scolytinae) is a native insect of the pine forests of western North America, and its populations periodically erupt into large-scale outbreaks1, 2, 3. During outbreaks, the resulting widespread tree mortality reduces forest carbon uptake and increases future emissions from the decay of killed trees. The impacts of insects on forest carbon dynamics, however, are generally ignored in large-scale modelling analyses. The current outbreak in British Columbia, Canada, is an order of magnitude larger in area and severity than all previous recorded outbreaks4. Here we estimate that the cumulative impact of the beetle outbreak in the affected region during 2000–2020 will be 270 megatonnes (Mt) carbon (or 36 g carbon m-2 yr-1 on average over 374,000 km2 of forest). This impact converted the forest from a small net carbon sink to a large net carbon source both during and immediately after the outbreak. In the worst year, the impacts resulting from the beetle outbreak in British Columbia were equivalent to 75% of the average annual direct forest fire emissions from all of Canada during 1959–1999. The resulting reduction in net primary production was of similar magnitude to increases observed during the 1980s and 1990s as a result of global change5. Climate change has contributed to the unprecedented extent and severity of this outbreak6. Insect outbreaks such as this represent an important mechanism by which climate change may undermine the ability of northern forests to take up and store atmospheric carbon, and such impacts should be accounted for in large-scale modelling analyses."<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v452/n7190/full/nature06777.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v45...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/ci_7972146" rel="nofollow">http://www.denverpost.com/ci_7972146</a><br>  <br>  So global warming creates conditions for pine beetles to flourish, killing more forests and removing a natural carbon sink, making global warming worse.  The study above notes that such a feedback is not included in climate models.  On the bright side, people who love pine beetles might approve of global warming.|`|AK8lKoXsaa	When thinking of effects, especially on the environment, you have to take a more indirect approach.  Global climate change might not directly affect insects at all.  However, said climate change could affect their prey, predators, and/or environment/habitat.  This can and will affect every single insect you mentioned, as well as all the rest.|`|wyD1M4Buaa	Well, since apparently AGW is going to completely destroy the Earth, I'd say they probably wouldn't do too well.<br>  <br>  Good thing we're in a cooling trend. Though, I must admit, I would not mind seeing mosquitoes go extinct.
dPsaYMOvaa	I'm not sure, but I heard Covergirl test on animals so you can probably add that to your list!<br>  These companies and their executive's need shot, or burnt with chemicals - hypothetically of course.

Since then other theories have come about including virus, disease, fungus, etc.  Bees are still disappearing but they still are not sure why.

Something about the electronic waves somehow kill the bees. I'll get back to you on it.|`|dPsaYMOvaa	Wow I don't know, but I hope not - poor bees!|`|I38WF5aFaa	About a year ago there were rumors that the transmissions from cell phones might be affecting bees ability to find their way back to the hive.  I don't know if it can be proved or not.  There are several things that are killing bees.  I don't think mobile phones are at the top of the list.
Wn3LGHTvaa	If you look at one of the hairs (fibres?) under the microscope, you should not only be able to determine whether it is animal fur or fake, you should be able to determine the species. As I recall, the seminal work on hair ID was done by someone named Hausman. A lot of his drawings were reproduced in Palmer's Fieldbook of Natural History.|`|dPsaYMOvaa	Generally by touch, if it feels fake then it probably is.. if it feels like your cat then it probably is. <br>  Read fur is absolutely disgusting, how could anyone wear fur that has come from an animal purposefully killed for their coat?|`|4J8X1aKkaa	If you can get close to it - the back of the piece.  Fur will have a hide back. Fake will have a cloth back and even the best will have some form of meshing or weave. You don't have to have access to the backside of the material (like in a lined coat you wouldn't) to be able to tell what's between the hairs.|`|8qORtvZKaa	you should be able to feel the difference..... also the price of the item would be able to tell you. real fur is very expensive|`|wyD1M4Buaa	But it's so warm and soft :/
z69rzdJZaa	I love it when jerks are just after the 2 points with their 'funny' answers. <br>  <br>  I have been cutting back on so many things, partly for my birds, all aerosol sprays are bad for them. <br>  I used to use Pam cooking spray (or the generic equivalent). Now I use a bit of Crisco, rub on with my fingers and not a paper towel, swish through the dish water and rinse, then dry on a kitchen towel before I flour the pan for making a cake.<br>  Making your own cake saves trash, no plastic container to throw away.<br>  I refuse to but products that over do the packaging. I don't need seven ounces of plastic container for that little gadget I thought I wanted.<br>  Repair what you have instead of buying a new one and throwing away the old one.<br>  A couple weeks ago, I fixed my 15 year old chainsaw, all it needed was a new fuel line and filter. Actually, I kept the filter for the next time, as it looks pretty clean! (I am a 47 yr old grandma, small engine repair is not one of my strong points, I found a how to on You Tube, and I am mechanically inclined, so I figured it out from there!)<br>  Free Cycle, a Yahoo group, is great for getting rid of things that are still useable but you don't want, or getting things that another might not want any more. Some people will take broken things you have and fix them. It's great, it recycles stuff, and it's free.<br>  Pass around books, read others collections, go to the library. Never buy a book that you don't want to keep forever. Now you can even read E Books, paperless! Put it on a disc and you will have it for a long time.<br>  Upgrade your old computer. Only buy a new one when you have to, and use the components to help people you know to upgrade. Only recycle it after you get all the parts off it that you think you will need.<br>  Clothing- don't buy new, buy from resale shops. Use what clothes you have until they can't be worn anymore, then use them for rags, or quilts, did you know thats how they did it in the old days? They didn't throw anything away. The unuseable pieces were stiched together for the filling. They did not use quilt batting back then.<br>  There are other things you can do, I love looking on the internet for new ideas and just to learn more!<br>  Who does it help? Our Grandchildren  :)|`|2fUEFEIaaa	Don't cut down trees. Recycle it the main thing to do here...<br>  ... You can help by like community service do anything that you can d to help save the earth ..

Change out incandescents for CFL's or LED's<br>   5. Clean the coils on your refrigerator<br>   6. Change your furnace/air conditioner filter regularly.<br>   7. When shopping look for items with less packaging and use canvas/cloth bags instead of paper or plastic bags.<br>   8. When commuting try carpooling, public transportation,walking, or if you must drive try to avoid unnecessary idling, quick sudden starts, or the ever popular giving it gas to get to the next red light.|`|AA11021880	try some of these sites :)<br>  <a href="http://www.wikia.com/wiki/Green_Wiki" rel="nofollow">http://www.wikia.com/wiki/Green_Wiki</a><br>  www.thegreenguide.com/ <br>  www.green-living.com/<br>  <a href="http://www.thegoodhuman.com/2007/10/30/35-low-cost-ways-to-green-your-lifestyle/" rel="nofollow">http://www.thegoodhuman.com/2007/10/30/3...</a><br>  www.care2.com/greenliving/ <br>  <a href="http://www.treehugger.com/gogreen.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.treehugger.com/gogreen.php</a><br>  <br>  Also im writing a page with lots of ideas.

5TKEtXERaa	Here is a video to explain|`|dwNW46wbaa	they melt it into bottles and other stuff|`|WahT76Puaa	Not all types of glass can be recycled. Most soda bottles, food containers, beer, wine, and liquor bottles, and juice containers can be recycled - either through curbside recycling programs or community drop-off centers.<br>  <br>  Every ton of glass that is recycled results in one ton of raw materials saved to process new glass, including: 1,300 pounds of sand, 410 pounds of soda ash and 380 pounds of limestone.<br>  <br>  Glass containers come in four different colors: clear, blue, brown and green; glass must be separated by color to ensure that new glass is not created from a mix of colors.<br>  <br>  Most recycling programs will only accept glass containers, because other glass products such as drinking glasses, light bulbs, mirrors and Pyrex are treated with contaminants when manufactured|`|215e8f63a273a9d5cbab203c741c8cecaa	They melt it and reshape it using forms that are designed for the specific product that you are manufacturing.
