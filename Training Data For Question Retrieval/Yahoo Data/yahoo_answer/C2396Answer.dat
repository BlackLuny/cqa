Therefore, only your GPA would carry you through.  The idea here is that you have taken enough courses with a decent overall GPA, proving your ability to sustain a college level education and so your high school history is now completely irrelevant.  <br>  <br>  If you lack the minimum credit amount and still decide to transfer, then you would have to submit SAT scores, regardless of when you graduated high school.  Check the college catalog of the respective places you wish to enroll, reference the admissions section for transfer students, and you'll find the specific numbers.|`|1qJCaT7eaa	Yes, you probably can as long as your transcript from community college are in order and look good.  More and more colleges/universities are not requiring SAT/ACT scores any more or are making them optional because some hold the belief that the tests are racially/culturally biased.|`|a193f3c453f33517b03522aadbd95f93aa	If you are transferring from a community college you shouldn't need SAT scores.  I recommend the Admissions section of the school's website in order to find out the specifics.  I'd say it is safe to say that you won't need to take the SAT exam however your grades at the community college will need to compensate for the missing scores.|`|iHWafGfuaa	All accredited colleges and universities require either of these 2 standardized tests .  These exams are believed to be a measure of the students proficiency in a typical High School curriculum and usually indicate that the students will succeed in college and beyond.|`|zUHqcnbCaa	I know adults returning to school don't need to take those tests, but if you're a recent graduate a credible school is going to want those test scores.|`|zURKN2gOaa	Generally, if you get your AA degree at a community college and transfer in, you don't need to take the ACT or SAT.  I would recommend that you complete your first two years at a community college before transferring to either of  the major universities you mentioned.  Generally, the community colleges in Texas have what is called an articulation agreement with the major universities in the state.  An articulation agreement is an agreement between community and four-year colleges and universities  that indicate the acceptability of courses in transfer toward meeting specific degree requirements.
U63ll2BWaa	I do not know whether they have an RN program or not. You do not say where you live but Moraine Valley in Palos Hills and Harper college in Palatine each have excellent programs. You would probably have to do all your general education classes the first year as they are hard to get into the heart of the program the first year. Much financial aid available at both.
aEdBOvlYaa	Here's the US News college ranking for "Top National Universities:<br>  <br>  4. Stanford<br>  5. Caltech<br>  21. UC Berkeley<br>  25. UCLA<br>  27. USC<br>  38. UCSD<br>  42. UC Davis<br>  44. UC Santa Barbara<br>  44. UC Irvine<br>  54. Pepperdine University<br>  79. UC Santa Cruz<br>  <br>  Note that this is a list of "National Universities" and does not include liberal arts colleges and "Regional Universities." If your concerns are to get a good job, all of these universities will suit your needs, but, of course, the higher ranked universities should give you more opportunities. However, don't choose a college by a small difference in ranking (e.g., Berkeley, LA, USC, and UCSD are only a few places apart). Consider the programs that the schools you are considering are respected for and where you would like to work after graduation. Hope this helps.

4bf3e7e41052ee9d4d31fb8a15d82691aa	LAS 10 CONSECUENCIAS MáS GRAVES DEL CALENTAMIENTO GLOBAL <br>  <br>  <br>  1-Crecimiento del nivel del agua por la fusión  de porciones de hielo polar, lo que originaria la desaparición de holanda y los países bajos del sur del Estado de Florida y la bahía de San Francisco en EU, así como los alrededores de Beihing y Shangai en China, Calcuta en la India y Bangla Desh, donde viven aproximadamente 60 millones de personas.  Según el Instituto de Hidrológica, Meteorología y Estudios Ambientales  (IDEAM) el nivel del mar en el Caribe se aumentara para el a?o 2060 en 40 cm.  Esto provocaría que las aguas subterrenaeas utilizadas para el abastecimiento sean invadidas por el agua salada del mar, ocasionando problemas de disponibilidad de agua dulce para consumo humano, actividades productivas y de turismo. <br>   <br>  <br>  2-Aumento de las enfermedades respiratorias, cardiovasculares e infecciosas causadas por mosquitos y plagas tropicales, además de la postración y la deshidratación debida al calor. <br>   <br>  <br>  3-Las altas temperaturas generaran un aumento de la demanda del agua potable que reducirá los niveles de los embalses, causando desabastecimiento. <br>   <br>  <br>  4-Escasez de alimentos ante las dificultades de cultivo por la afectación de los suelos y las altas temperaturas. <br>   <br>  <br>  5-Extinción de gran cantidad de especies animales como consecuencia de cambias en los ecosistemas.  Según el IDEAM, el incremento de la temperatura del mar afectaría notablemente a los corales, los cuales constituyen una especie de salacunas para los peces.  Con ello, en Colombia se vería afectada la actividad pesquera y la biodiversidad representada en especies endémicas (únicas en el mundo). <br>   <br>  <br>  6-Aumento de la intensidad y frecuencia de las lluvias, huracanes y tornados, ante un ascenso en los índices de nubosidad por el incremento de la evaporación del agua. <br>   <br>  <br>  7-Disminución del nivel de agua de ríos y lagos debido a la evaporación causada por el aumento de la temperatura. <br>   <br>  <br>  8-éxodo de ecosistemas: la región tropical se extenderá hacia latitudes mas altas, y las regiones de bosques y pinos se desplazaran hacia regiones que hoy forman parte de la tundra y la taiga.  Por su parte, los ecosistemas costeros tendrán cambios profundos, ya que el alza del mar provocara la inundación de las costas. <br>   <br>  <br>  9-Los suelos se tornaran casi desérticos, perdiendo gran parte de sus nutrientes. <br>   <br>  <br>  10- El aumento de las temperaturas permitirá la reproducción de ciertos insectos que le causaran enfermedades a las plantas y afectaran los cultivos.

Wenn Du denkst, Du w?rst fett, ist das wahrscheinlich auch der Fall! <br>        Frag′ mich nicht, ich verweigere die Aussage.<br>    2. Wenn Du etwas willst, reicht es v?llig, einfach danach zu fragen. Um eines klarzustellen: <br>        Wir verstehen keine subtilen indirekten Fragen. Indirekte Fragen funktionieren nicht. <br>        Die auf der Hand liegenden indirekten Fragen auch nicht. Sage einfach wie es ist.<br>    3. Wenn Du eine Frage stellst, auf die Du keine Antwort erwartest, wundere Dich nicht, <br>        dass eine Antwort kommt, die Du nicht h?ren wolltest. Wir sind simpel!<br>    4. Wenn ich Dich bitte, mir das Brot anzureichen, meine ich nichts anderes als das. <br>        Es ist kein Vorwurf, dass es nicht auf dem Tisch steht. Es gibt weder versteckte Andeutungen noch        Vorwürfe. Wir sind wirklich simpel.<br>    5. Es macht keinen Sinn mich zu fragen an was ich denke! 96,5% der Zeit denken M?nner an Sex.       Nein, wir sind nicht besessen, es ist einfach das, was uns am meisten gef?llt.<br>    6. Manchmal denke ich nicht an Dich. Das ist nicht schlimm. Gew?hne Dich bitte daran. <br>        Frage bitte nicht, woran ich denke, es sei denn Du bist bereit, über Politik, Wirtschaft, Philosophie,   Fu?ball, Saufen, Ti..en, Hintern oder Autos zu reden.<br>    7. Freitag/Samstag/Sonntag = viel fressen = Freunde = Fu?ball vorm Fernseher = Bier = schlechte Manieren. Es ist wie Vollmond oder Ebbe und Flut... oder eure Monatsblutung!

Welche Klamotten Du auch tr?gst. Es steht Dir super. Ich schw?r′s.<br>  10. Du hast genug Kleider und genug Schuhe. Heulen ist Erpressung! <br>        Mich selbst pleite zu machen ist kein Liebesbeweis an Dich.<br>        Wir sind Simpel!<br>  11. Die meisten M?nner haben 3 Paar Schuhe.

Einfache Antworten wie Ja oder Nein sind v?llig ausreichend, egal wie die Frage lautet!<br>  13. Wenn Du ein Problem hast, bitte mich nur darum Dir zu helfen, das Problem zu l?sen. <br>        Bitte mich nicht, Dich zu bemitleiden, wie es Deine Freundinnen tun.<br>  14. Kopfschmerzen, die 8 Wochen dauern, sind keine Kopfschmerzen! Geh zum Arzt!<br>  15. Wenn ich etwas sage, das auf zwei Arten interpretiert werden kann und eins von beiden <br>        beunruhigt Dich oder macht Dich unglücklich, meine ich das andere!<br>  16.

Und was für eine Farbe ist überhaupt Apriko(t), und wie zur H?lle schreibt man das?<br>  18  Bier gef?llt uns, wie euch Handtaschen gefallen. Ihr versteht′s nicht, wir auch nicht.<br>  19. Wenn ich Dich frage, was los ist und Du antwortest "Nichts", werde ich Dir glauben <br>        und so tun, als ob alles in bester Ordnung sei!<br>  20. Frag nicht: "Magst Du mich?" Sei Dir sicher, dass ich nicht bei Dir w?re, w?re das nicht der Fall!<br>  21.

Im allgemeinen wird den Frauen nachgesagt, dass bei ihnen viele Denk- und Handlungsweisen intuitiev ablaufen (anders gesagt: "bauchgesteuert"), w?hrend die m?nnliche Art mehr "kopfgesteuert" reagiert.<br>  Es gibt jedoch - um eine Anleihe bei Siegmund Freud zu nehmen - auch m?nnliche Wesen mit einer stark "weiblich ausgepr?gten Seite", die dann auch entsprechend "weiblich-intuitiv" reagieren (was aber meistens durch die Kindeserziehung wieder unterdrückt wird, dort wird die "m?nnliche Intuition" nicht gef?rdert.<br>  Und nun kommt dazu die zweite Schwierigkeit: "wie sag ich`s meinem Weibe"! Die Damen und Herren der Sch?pfung "ticken" grunds?tzlich auf andere Art und Weise und es ist schon sehr sehr schwer, einer Frau überhaupt die "m?nnliche Art und Weise" einigerma?en nahe zu bringen, denn wir reden ja schon mit verschiedenen Zungen (M?nner sagen meistens das, was sie meinen; Frauen dagegen meinen fast immer etwas anderes, als sie sagen!). <br>  Geht es nun um die fast "rein weibliche Dom?ne" der Intuition, so meine ich, ist es fast unm?glich, einer Frau zu erkl?ren, da? auch die M?nner die Gabe der Intuition besitzen k?nnen (wobei ich dazu neige, nicht von  d e r m?nnlichen Intuition zu reden (es sei denn, der Mann ist Magier, vom Sternzeichen Wassermann oder die Frau ist rettungslos in ihn verliebt und glaubt ihm deshalb alles, was er sagt...).<br>  Aber mein lieber Controll (der Nickname klingt ja nicht sehr intuitiv, sondern mehr verstandesbetont...), wozu den freuen die "m?nnliche Intuition"  e r k l ? re n?

Habe noch nie davon geh?rt. Dass es Intuition gibt wei? ich, aber nicht dass es eine geschlechtsspezifische Intuition gibt!<br>  Tatsache ist, dass Frauen eher auf ihre Bauchstimme h?ren, weil M?nner alles mit Logik erkl?ren m?chten.<br>  @tedthecat bist du Mario Barth oder hast du nur seine Thesen übernommen?|`|861d277ffc1bdd4f70cc69cae93c4482aa	Tja, Contr?llchen, eine wirklich diffizile Frage, wozu Du eigentlich doch schon die Antwort gegeben hast.<br>  <br>  Wie? Nun, schau. <br>  Du hattest doch diesen Geistesblitz mal kurz nach Dubai ins Bursh el arab zu jetten. Mal einfach nur so übers WE.<br>  Ok ok, kostet ein kleines Verm?gen, ist aber total die m?nnliche Intuition (intueri = erw?gen)<br>  <br>  Eine Dame?

aoQh6XtFaa	Gene Roddenberry hat diese Frage bereits grunds?tzlich mit seinen Star Trek Romanen beantwortet: Wenn eine Zivilisation so weit fortgeschritten ist, dass sie einen Warp-Antrieb entwickeln kann, ist sie für fortschrittlichere galaktische Zivilisationen erst interessant.<br>  <br>  Einfacher Hintergrund: Hat eine Zivilisation keinen Warp-Antrieb, ist sie gleichzeitig keine Gefahr, da sie niemals innerhalb einer angemessenen Zeit einen anderen bewohnten Planeten erreichen k?nnte.<br>  <br>  H?tte die Menschheit jedoch einen solchen Roddenberry-Warp-Antrieb, so würde sich schnell herausstellen, wie gro? die von unserer Rasse ausgehende Gefahr für die galaktischen V?lker w?ren.<br>  <br>  Philosophisch betrachtet, würde ich Dir daher antworten: Es ist besser, der Menschheit in ihrer derzeitigen Konstitution aus dem Weg zu gehen, da die weltweit politisch gepflegte und gehegte  Dummheit und Arroganz gef?hliche Waffen für sich w?ren. Und zwar Waffen, die zur zwangsl?ufigen geistigen Rückentwicklung galaktischer Besucher führen würden, vergleichbar mit einem Vakuumstrahler.<br>  <br>  Solange der Mensch nicht gelernt hat, über seinen ?ffischen Tellerrand hinauszuschauen, sollte kein Kontakt mit unserer tobenden Rasse im Interesse eines Ausserirdischen sein - es sei denn, unser Planet würde als so etwas wie eine Spezialklinik für psychotische Aliens genutzt werden sollen.|`|7n8KL1Qmaa	In der Frage steckt DIE Antwort!|`|TcgQfLnWaa	wenn man es so betrachtet... ja da geb ich dir recht|`|Zy4TAoIfaa	Ja, eindeutig! <br>  Wer weiss vielleicht streunern hier verdeckt ein paar Alf`s rum.|`|K6dI7jvzaa	auf jeden fall---100%|`|wN8Ns6P0aa	Wer will sich schon mit einer so streitsüchtigen Rasse Mensch abgeben, wo sie doch  Adam und Eva auch schon ausgesetzt hatten.|`|1SsA9wkkaa	hehe. denkst du nicht es ist die beste manipulation? solche minderbemittelten lassen sich gut 'regieren'. via white house.|`|KyHQ6gpPaa	Gute Frage *lach*|`|QrkuLH1vaa	Auch ich gebe dir uneingeschr?nkt recht!

coryejcdaa	Nun, jedenfalls behauptete Bob Marley das von sich, aber das tat Eric Clapton auch schon. Beide behaupteten zudem in Notwehr gehandelt zu haben und beide erw?hnten auch einen mysteri?sen Deputy, der nicht erschossen wurde. <br>  Von Eric Clapton wissen wir inzwischen mit ziemlicher Sicherheit, da? er den Sheriff nicht erschossen hat, er übernahm lediglich den Bericht Marleys um den Verkauf seines Albums 461 Ocean Boulevard anzukurbeln. <br>  Aber wie glaubhaft ist Bob Marleys Aussage und was hat es mit dem Deputy auf sich? <br>  Zumindest wissen wir, da? sich Marley zum Zeitpunkt der Erschie?ung des Sheriffs in der N?he aufhielt und das der Sheriff auf Streit aus war, weil im Jesse James die Frau ausgespannt und Billy the Kid ihm sein Pferd geklaut hatte. Er war jedenfalls seht übellaunig, ein Rassist und konnte Kiffer und Rastafaris nicht ausstehen. Also schlechte Karten für Bob.<br>  Der Sheriff machte also übellaunig, reizbar und streitlustig seinen Rundgang durch die Stadt, auf der Suche nach einem leichten Opfer, das als Zielscheibe für seine Aggressionen geeignet war. Sein Blick fiel auf Bob Marley, der vor dem Saloon hockte und sich eine Tüte reinzog. Er stiefelte auf den Reggae-K?nig zu und herrschte ihn an:"Na, Du mieser Kiffer! Du weist doch, da? das Verboten ist!" Mit dem Lauf seines Colts deutete der Sheriff aus Bobs Joint.<br>  Der Sheriff baute sich breitbeinig vor Bob auf und lie? den Colt in den Halfter gleiten. Ein heimtückisches Grinsen umspielte seine Mundwindwinkel. Endlich war er am Ziel seiner Wünsche. Diesem schwarzen Kiffer würde er eine Lektion erteilen.<br>  "Zieh!" herrschte er Marley an. Bob lie? sich das nicht zweimal sagen und nahm einen tiefen Zug aus seiner Tüte.<br>  Fassungslos starrte ihn der Sheriff an. "Du sollst Deine Kanone ziehen!" Bob grinste den Sheriff an und reichte ihm den Joint. "Alter, alles easy, nimm erst mal 'ne Ladung und dann cool down." <br>  Mit wutverzerrtem Gesicht griff der Sheriff zu seiner Pistole: "Das reicht, jetzt bist Du f?llig!" brüllte er noch. Dann peitschte ein Schu? durch die staubige Luft vor dem Saloon.<br>  Ungl?ubig starrte der Sheriff auf das Blut, das aus der Einschu??ffnung in seiner Brust flo?. Noch ungl?ubiger starrte er Bob Marley an, der friedlich vor ihm sa? und an seiner Tüte paffte. Dann brach er zusammen.<br>  Aus dem Schatten des Sallons trat der Deputy, der seinen rauchenden Colt wieder zurück in das Halfter steckte. Er beugte sich über den leblos da liegenden K?rper des Sheriffs und sagte leise: "Du wirst nie wieder unschuldige Musiker abknallen, Du Idiot."<br>  Dann richtete sich der Deputy auf schob seinen Stetson in den Nacken  und jetzt konnte man sein Gesicht erkennen, es war - Ralf Hütter, der wieder einmal unterwegs war um unschuldige Musiker vor ungerechten, b?sartigen Sheriffs zu beschützen.<br>  Bob Marley hat dieses Ereignis sp?ter in seinem Welthit "I Shot The Sheriff" verewigt, da er aber zu diesem Zeitpunkt schon etwas stoned war, sind ihm einige Fakten etwas durcheinander geraten.|`|0gM4zMtaaa	...wie? Die Geschichte kennste nich? Ok, also, das kam so:<br>  <br>  Bob M. und Jimmy H. waren zum chillen verabredet. Katzengras war alle, daher fingen sie an, die Weihnachtsdeko zu rauchen. <br>  Bekannterweise knallen Strohsterne und Lametta besonders hart in der Birne. Daher kam dem Bob und dem Jimmy in den Sinn, die Stadt etwas aufzumischen. <br>  Vor dem Saloon banden sie ihre Pferde Lollek und Bollek an und wollten einen Heben. Der Sheriff und Joe, der Deputy sachten aber: "ey, ihr kummt hier net rein"! <br>  Da wurden beide sauer: Der Bob holte seinen 1,50 Meter Joint und pustete den Sheriff um. Der Jimmy fing ein Verh?ltnis mit Rosanna an, der Ollen vom Joe dem Deputy. <br>  Als der Joe das herausbekam, erschoss er seine Frau, und verkrümelte sich nach Mexiko und der Jimmy schrieb nen coolen Song drüber.|`|1SsA9wkkaa	"i want to say 'i shot the police' but the government would have made a fuss so i said 'i shot the sheriff' instead... but it's the same idea: justice."|`|9JbTwu6Vaa	Ohne Leiche gibt es auch keinen M?rder.|`|BHhMMRPDaa	Ja klar hat er ihn erschossen und Prinz Ludwig auch!<br>  ;-)|`|K6dI7jvzaa	but he didn't shot the deputy....|`|c2d97ed6d93b0e6746b4bb7e2dcd2f16aa	da konter sich nach der dritten tüte nich mehr so recht erinnern !|`|j5WPArOPaa	ei dont know:gg|`|b1fd4f813979f2f418f9acc06e2cd285aa	ja, darum usste er ja hinterher sein ganzes leben lang kiffen, um  nicht immer wieder daran denken zu müssen.<br>  schlimme geschichte.<br>  aber den zweiten mann hat er leben lassen...|`|2a612225665dcc9750bbcf2909421a31aa	i shot the sheriff, but i did not shoot ....the deputy (hat der schwein gehabt)...<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAixXMbyOBc" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAixXMbyO...</a><br>  aber seit wann kannst du reggae leiden ?<br>  p.s. oh mann. das iss′n lied...oder war deine frage, wie man ein buch über das lied schreibt ????<br>  nochmal p.s. das war′n glatter durchschuss. der sheriff hat die kugel hinten ganz cool aufgefangen....<br>  so, jetzt wi?t ihr′s alle..<br>  eine aus dem clan der mac leods....|`|Fm4GpEqqaa	Ja hat er!

fkuKUxrpaa	I am 299 out of 995 students, lol. I had a 87% GPA, and they gave me a 3.167. I was told by my AP teacher that you shouldn't take class rank to serious. I'm in all honors and a AP. A student who is in all CP classes can be number 20. They don't do it by how hard your classes are, but just your total GPA. My GPA would be higher if I were in easier classes, but you rather have a A in an honors class than a B in a CP class. It will look better when you apply to schools. I wouldn't worry about it, because they're not efficient. They usually add 10 points on your AP grade, but take it off when you apply to a college. Though, then they add .5 which is just as good. They probably had it weighted, but it depends on the school. Good Luck!|`|AA12021966	178 out of 801 is good. Keep it up there.

We know that the length(l) is 1 foot longer than twice its width so l=2w+1. Now remember that length times width equals area so if 2w+1 is the length and the width is w then 2w+1*w=area(A)<br>  We are then told that the original area which is 2w+1*w is increased by 90 ft sq. So 2w+1*w+90=the new area. We know that 5 feet is added to the original length and width to get the new are so 2w+1+5 is the new length and w+5 is the new width. Now remember that length times width equals area so (2w+1+5)= which is the new length times (w+5) is the new area. 2w+1+5=2w+6 so then (2w+6)(w+5) is the new area. We also know that 2w+1*w+90=(2w+1)(w)+90 is the new area. So we have two equations that tell us the new area so both equations are equal. So then we can set them equal to each other and solve.(2w+6)(w+5)=(2w+1)(w)+90. This is what I did below. It requires some foiling, subtracting and dividing terms. <br>  <br>  <br>  (2w+6)(w+5)=(2w+1)(w)+90<br>  2w^2+16w+30=2w^2+w+90<br>  16w+30=w+90<br>  15w=60<br>  w=4<br>  <br>  Then after I solved for w I substituted it into the equation for the new are and solved. Remember that we were given two equations for the new area? So you can use either of the two equations to solve for the new area. The two equations that we were given are (2w+6)(w+5) and (2w+1)(w)+90. Both will give you the new are because both are equal.<br>  <br>  (2(4)+6)(4+5)=126 sq ft<br>  <br>  And there's your new area. Don't forget your units!

nRnokrwKaa	I did A-level psychology last year, wouldn't advise it, I wish I'd picked philosophy personally, but that's just my preference. Be aware that psychology isn't as juicy a subject as you may think, I had always been interested in human behaviour and I found myself thoroughly bored during my psychology course as it is more similar to a science than a humanity in the methods that are used, and seeing as your other choices are more arts/humanities oriented, as mine were (History and Politics) I wouldn't put you down as the kind to prefer the scientific approach. Also, much of A-level psychology is mere regurgetation of the names, dates, pros and cons of different psychologists' studies, which is handy for people like me who switched off for six months of the last year and spent my remaining time memorising the details of about eighty studies, but not so good if you actually want to do particularly well (I ended up with only a C)    As for business studies, It is a lighter subject, less academic, and so may do you credit to have something like that seeing as you have four other reasonably bulky subjects already chosen (I could barely cope with 3 in my last year!), and for philosophy, well that would be the one I'd choose but I'm interested in that area, although from what I've heard Its less about developing your own philosophy and more about commenting on others', which may be disappointing to you, but if you're anything like me that may still be of interest.    All I can say is that I most definitely do not recommend Psychology, and neither would anyone else who did it with me for that matter! Hope that helps!|`|Q5EftYrpaa	Take psychology, but approach it as if it is a science.  Take philosophy, and approach it as a social study.   If you are aren't taking a science class, then psychology might give your schedule some balance, although the course is often in schools' social studies departments. If you don't enjoy science, then take philosophy.
T0pkW783aa	Dear Miss Jones:    I want you to know what a wonderful experience it was for me to have the opportunity to come into your first grade class to observe your methods of teaching, to see the children and to be a part of the classroom setting.  As you know, I am going to school to become a teacher and it is great to be able to sit in on the action as I did in your class.    I enjoyed seeing how you interact with the children and how they respond to your methods of teaching.  It was very obvious to me, as an observer, that you are very in touch with the children and I see that they enjoy being a part of your class.        I got some constructive ideas on how I might be able to handle a classroom of this size with students of the same age.  I left feeling a sense of excitement and fulfillment just knowing that teaching is definitely something I want to do.    Thank you for allowing me the privilege of observing you.   The experience made a difference to me and I appreciate your generosity in permitting me to be a part of your day.    Sincerely|`|T11AOlenaa	Bring up a specific time that you remember, and go into detail about how it helped you.|`|4d8g3q6saa	Miss Robie, if you HAVE TO  write a Thank you letter ,it you   regard  it as an obligation than it all ends up  in a feeling of uneasiness.Why don't you just let your heart speak?  She gave you the chance to get  first  manyfold impressions  of her job which is much more than a job: it is a  profession ( regarding the qualification) ,but a teacher,  especially a first grade teacher, should be a person with a   wide heart and a creative mind, having a deep understanding  of the way the little ones think and act. (Any teacher should   have these qualities,I think, irrespective of  the age of  his   students.)    To have had the chance to look into this new world for you -  hasn't it been a unique chance ? So do not see the letter   as an obligation.Let your heart speak, okay?    HySt2812

21PsQAO2aa	That's a very difficult question to answer. If your going to Med school, your going to be in a LOT of debt already, not counting going to an expensive school. I know it can be hard - I go to a $35000 college with absolutely no help from my parents.    I would suggest talking to their financial aid to see if there's any way you can get better scholarships, etc.    I graduated with a guy who got into Columbia university for math on a full ride (very very good college for math) but instead he went to Harvard - they gave him minimal assistance. He's still there now, but in debt over his head and probably won't pay it off for a long time.    I would suggest keeping your doors open to other colleges while you talk to the financial aid department from Tulane - if the college is close to you set up an appointment to see them in person.    EDIT: Yes, you can always go to a 2nd choice college for your undergraduate, and then apply to tulane for your graduate studies. As far as a job is concerned, they look at the last place you studied (i.e. the college you went for your graduate/Ph.D.) This isn't ideal I know, but its an option.|`|lQIKWXDuaa	Ok.

33f036844cd94cb01a2593236fef12aaaa	Ask your teacher for the marking schedule, the difference between and A and a C is often very small - choice of vocabulary, where you put emphasis in your answer etc, not necessarily in the amount of facts you know, or include in your answers.  If you can work smarter ie; give the examiner what they want ( you will need your teachers help to figure this out) you will not need to work much harder.  Unfortunately, if you are on for a C the teachers will let you drift, they will now need to concentrate on the D/E pupils, who with effort could get a C - as that boosts the schools position in the league tables.  If you show you are concerned about your grades most decent teachers will be prepared to help you.|`|LyoKmnZZaa	i am having the same problem I used to get a and a* in all my tests last year now it's b and c and a few a i figured the problem by reading my papers     the problem was I wasn't reading the questions right and not giving enough in depth answers now my grades are better|`|AA11603954	Study harder than before|`|nz8o3lLSaa	First off, try to write a complete sentence void of spelling errors.

7Tg1rMdOaa	Why don't you make little rewards for yourself?  Every day, finish what you can in class.  When you get home, if you finish your homework, you get this little reward.  It could be watching the Yankees play, or whatever.  You have to be firm with yourself and know that you may have to make some sacrifices to bring up your GPA. If you see that the distraction of the games is too much.  Ask your parents to drop you off at the library, where there are no TVs.  That'll keep the distraction away, and you won't be able to leave the library until your parents come back to pick you up, after your homework is done.

5zhAdR1raa	A GED is considered the equivalent of a high school diploma by colleges, etc. I know that is not what you asked, however.     Each state's department of education regulates the awarding of high school diplomas - by setting the standards to receive one. So, you could contact your state department of education and ask them.    I do not know if the online diplomas are scams or not, but if you explore that route, just do yourself a favor and be sure to check them out with the Better Business Bureau, or even just googling "complaints" and the name of the program you are contemplating.

3MbgHvLWaa	I've listed the following information for you that should be helpful when taking all these exams. By the way there are books &CD's that you can purchase that will help you study for these exams & you will definitely score higher if you study for these exams.     In many cases you can find study guides for these exams at your local bookstores such as Barnes & Noble & the books are not expensive. You may even find these books at one of your libraries where they would be free of charge.    If not, another great source is order these study guides on-line at www.Amazon.com. If you've never heard of this website then look it up. You will need a credit card to order but the books will be shipped to you in about a week with a small delivery charge. I've ordered many books this way & it works great. Just go to the website and look for books. When you get the book section, just search for ACT exam, PSAT exam and SAT exam. Don't be afraid to order the used books. They are much cheaper & most of them are still in "like new" condition.      In case you didn't know, you might want to do some research about taking the PSAT exam. This is excellent preparation for taking the SAT exam.      The Preliminary SAT/National Merit Scholarship Qualifying Test is a multiple-choice standardized test administered by the College Board and National Merit Scholarship Corporation (NMSC) in the United States.    An estimated 1.3 million high school juniors and sophomores take the test each year. Recently, some freshmen, 8th, and 7th graders have also begun taking this test. The scores from the PSAT are used (with the permission of the student) to determine eligibility for the National Merit Scholarship Program    The test is composed of three sections: Mathematics, Critical Reading, and Writing, and takes two hours and ten minutes to complete. Each of the three sections is scored on a scale of 20 to 80 points, which add up to a maximum composite score of 240 points. This parallels the SAT, which is graded on a scale of 200 to 800 (the narrower range is to distinguish from which test a score comes and to denote less accuracy). However, unlike the new (2005) SAT, the new PSAT does not include higher-level mathematics (e.g., concepts from Algebra II) or an essay in its writing section (which was added to the SAT in 2005).    The sum of the three scores is known as the Selection Index and is used, along with four general criteria for eligibility such as U.S. citizenship (or be a U.S. lawful permanent resident or have applied for permanent residence, the application for which has not been denied, and intend to become a U.S. citizen at the earliest opportunity allowed by law), for both preliminary and primary selection in the National Merit Scholarship Programs.    The minimum Selection Index for recognition as a Semifinalist is determined by selection unit (50 states, three other geographic units, and a number of boarding school regions) and is set by the NMSC in each at whatever score yields about the 99th percentile. While many people object to this (particularly those who score well in states with high minimums), this is used instead of a national minimum to ensure an even geographical distribution of Semifinalists. Because it is dependent on selection unit, on the number of students taking the test in the selection unit, and how well the students in the selection unit do on the test, the minimum varies from year to year and from selection unit to selection unit. For example, for the 2007 competition (2005 PSAT), minimum scores required for Semifinalist recognition ranged from 204 in Mississippi to 224 in Massachusetts, with an unweighted mean of 215.    Students not recognized as Semifinalists whose Selection Index is above a different limit are recognized as Commended Students and receive Letters of Commendation. This minimum is determined nationally and is set at whichever score yields the 96th percentile. It rose from 202 for the 2006 Program (2004 PSAT) to 203 for the 2007 Program (2005 PSAT).    After being confirmed as a Semifinalist (which occurs one year after taking the PSAT as a junior), students must complete an application to become a Finalist. Other factors besides the PSAT Selection Index score are taken into account, such as the student's Grade Point Average (GPA) and extra-curricular activities. However, these criteria are not particularly rigorous, and simply completing the application is typically enough to advance to Finalist standing, since approximately 15,000 of the 16,000 Semifinalists become Finalists.        Here is some information that I think you'll find helpful!     SAT 2 Subject Test General Course Information    What is the SAT II (SAT Subject Test)    While almost every college requires the SAT Reasoning Test (formerly called the SAT I exam) for admission, many of the more competitive colleges (like Harvard, Princeton, Stanford, MIT, etc.) also require another set of exams called the SAT Subject Tests (former

clu2Ia4paa	ok but legalizing is the opposite of banning so ur contradicting ur self  u could say:  Through the years, the world has suffered many different problems. Some of these problems are caused by legalizing alcohol and drugs.people act irrationally while under the influence of drugs and alcohol and do harmful and dangerous things.Available to the public, drugs and alcohol are being used and abused by the wrong people.(thesis) By making drugs and alcohol illegal, the world would be a better place for everybody.     that's the best i could do for now i hope i helped u :)|`|vPdjudeiaa	I am not trying to be rude, but it's a little short. Maybe I can help.    Intro- What you have so far is good, but try this after it.  Drugs and alcohol are one of the main causes of death in the United States. They should be banned from our country, for our sake, and for other people's too. Here are my reasons for banning these dangerous items.    Thesis- Legalizing? By what you said in your question, you are writing a report on why drugs and alcohol SHOULD be banned, so try this.           By using drugs and alcohol, we are not only hurting ourselves, but we can hurt others as well. When people use drugs such as marijuana and cocaine, they often don't know what they are doing. They could die the first time or keep doing it and while under the influence, hurt other people too. It is the same while drinking. It is illegal to drive drunk, but when people are drunk, they have no clue what is happening around them. They can't see, walk, or talk without having problems. How should they know if they are driving? By making these dangerous drugs illegal, we can stop the accidents, arrests, and deaths.           If people get caught using illegal drugs, they could be sentenced to time in prison, but the worst part is, they will have to live with what they did for the rest of their lives. If they do that, they are not being fair to themselves. Also, these things are addictive! Even if they wanted to stop, they might not be able to. It would be extremely hard, especially if they don't have a family to go home to every day. If we ban drugs and alcohol, then we are also making lives better for American citizens.           Last, but not least, banning these deadly items could make it more clear that these items put many lives in jeopardy! There are laws that restrict certain things to a certain age or altogether, but if you haven't noticed lately, people disregard these rules for their own pleasure. If people learn how dangerous these drugs really are, they might not be so keen on doing them. People should be required to take a special drug safety course in high school or attend a seminar if they drop out. For people who have started and can't quit, they should have a special type of rehab in a central area of each state so they can get the undivided attention that they need. Doing so might increase their chances of being able to quit.    Closing- Try this.        Now that you see the problems that are brought with drugs, you will see why banning drugs is a good thing. Please take everything I said into consideration. Thanks.
d15d582a53577bcf335f0863223462abaa	Yes, I would say just write up your results as "it appears that the amount of bacteria present was too small to affect blah blah blah..."  and for your observations just write "after 4 days, no bacteria grew..."|`|2FudsFrHaa	Did you sterilize the brushes before the experiment?  How long were the brushes left in each spot?  I'm wondering if rinsing each day was a good idea, although you want to replicate what would happen in daily use.  Are you using the bathroom as you normally would (spreading germs).   Was the agar thoughouly cooled when you rubbed the brush in it?  Was the dish kept at the correct temp for bacterial growth?    If you don't have time to replicate the experiment, just explain exactly what you did and your results. The best scientific knowledge comes from failed experiments. Make sure you state your theory and hypothesis as you should, and not on your results.  Your conclusion can include any changes you may make, or you may just conclude that your bathroom is spotless and bacteria free.

AA10176626	We get a lot of these questions here ("How much will I get?"), and the answer is always "There is no way to know for sure".    One factor is definitely your choice of school:  Each school has its own "track record" as to how effectively they are able to assist their students with financial need. If you are curious about a particular school, you can look around for a copy of a book called "The College Money Handbook" - you'll probably find it at any large bookstore, and at many libraries. Maybe your high school guidance office has a copy.    You've mentioned your income, and that your family receives food stamps. Unfortunately, that's not enough information to accurately predict your financial aid eligibility. If the analysis was that simple, the FAFSA would have a half a dozen questions, but if you've looked at the FAFSA, you've probably noticed that there are 100 or more questions. All of that information is used by the Department of Education to evaluate your Expected Family Contribution, and it's that EFC score that will determine how much aid you are qualified to receive.    It certainly SOUNDS as if you will be found to have demonstrated what they call "exceptional need". Aid applicants with exceptional need qualify for the broadest possible range of financial aid programs - especially the programs that are referred to as "need-based aid".     Those programs include the Pell Grant program, which may provide up to $5231 a year in free "cash" (IF the proposed $500 increase makes it through Congress), as well as other possible grants, the federal work study program (which would provide a part-time job), and perhaps a subsidized Stafford loan or Perkins loan (where the government pays the interest on your loan while you're in school).    The only way to find out for sure is to complete the FAFSA, and see what your school's financial aid office can offer. They'll tell you all about what they can do for you in an "aid offer letter" that you will receive several months before school actually starts.    What's the maximum amount of aid you could ever possibly hope to get? Maybe around $12,000-13,000 from the federal government, plus whatever your school and state can provide. Students who will be attending school with almost complete reliance on financial aid need to select a school that will come in under that budget. Talk to your guidance counselor or college advisor about the differences in cost between some of the schools that you are interested in.    Good luck!|`|ziB3xYY0aa	What was your EFC   from the FAFSA? and what type of school do you plan to attend, public or private university or community college?

So to your first problem -2+5 it equals +3. -3-(-3) is different.     I'll make this short and simple. If you have a problem with two negatives next to each other i.e 4-(-5) or 5-(-3) then change the two negatives to a positive so 4-(-5) would be 4+5= 9. For -3-(-3) it would be -3+3 which is zero NOT 6. It would be 6 if the problem read -3+-3. To divide integers this is the rule: a -(negative) divided by a +(positive) is a - or a + divided by a - is still a -. A + divided by a + is obviously a + and a - divided by a - is a +...that is just how it is. So the answer to your second problem +16/-2 is -8.     I didn't go into deep detail about WHY this is how it is just giving you the basics.Hope this helps.    ~Carpe Diem~|`|cmQZRsa4aa	Integers are just whole numbers.  So all you would do is divide 16 by -2.  So 16/2=8 since 2 is negative 16/-2=-8.  That's all there is to it. =]

The San Deigo-Coronado bridge is a pier-type bridge that transfers the load through the piers (legs) to the footings (steel-reinforced concrete) that extend deeply into the bay floor.  Because it is constructed of prestressed elements, the design is relatively simple, but must be built very closely to the specifications in order to maintain the design integrity.

nMdCdhPTaa	I'm not too sure on what you're asking exactly, but I'll give it a go.    Depends on the school.    I go to a public school and the subjects I can do are:    Accounting, History, Biology, Health & Human Development, Business Management, Information Technology (Applications), Chemistry, Information Technology Design & Technology (Wood), International Studies,  Drama, Legal Studies, Economics, Mathematical Methods, English Media Studies, English Literature,Music Performance, Food & Technology, Physical Education, Foundation Mathematics, Physics, Further Mathematics, Psychology, General Mathematics, Specialist Mathematics, Geography, Studio Arts, German,  Visual & Graphic Communication.    I have to do six of those subjects. However other public schools might not have these, or will have other subjects to offer.    We do a lot of work for any of those subjects and they're all challenging in some way. Basically what we do are the requirements set for the school and what we do depends on what we're studying.    As for homework, it also depends on what we're doing at school. Mostly I get a lot of homework, it varies from reading books, analysing movies, essays, assignments, prac work, revision and other stuff. But it's usually around 1-3 hours a night.    But every school is different, it's not likely that every school does the same thing.|`|AA12361379	I am not at all sure I understand your question, but I will try.  I was a teacher for 30 years in MO so I have some experience.      As far as I know, each state determines the minimum requirements (what classes, how many required units of certain subjects).  For example, the last I knew MO required 3 years of English (language arts) for graduation from a MO public high school.      I believe each district then has the options of adding elective classes -- like Spanish or Home economic classes (probably called something else nowadays).      As for homework, as far as I know, that is determined by each teacher.  At least where I taught, certainly no one ever said I had to give a certain amount of homework, or that I could only give a certain amount.    Hope this helps you.  I'd love to know why you considered this urgent.|`|dba088abfd1bf357434386029c21abbcaa	Take a math class, social studies, english, science class as core classes and then theres lot of electives.

For now concentrate on getting good grades so that you can get into a good college for undergrad. You should do some volunteering, and get some hobbies, admission committees like to see that you are a well-rounded person that is also community-minded. Shadowing is another great idea, because the adcoms will want to know that you understand something about what it is like to be a doctor. After you take your pre-requisites in college you will take the MCAT, and there are great prep courses (I used ExamKrackers). Take a lot of sciences, the repetition will only make it easier for you.

Recordings might not work for you if you are visual because auditory learning is on the other end of the scale (at least in some learning styles instruments) from visual learning.  You could check out Web sites that cover the topics you are studying.  Try this:  Google, advanced, look for topic, specify that results returned must be in PowerPoint format.  For some things, you might also find YouTube videos.  Also search this term:  "learning styles inventory."  Go to the results from North Carolina University.

JOXQrsw0aa	To have  good time in HS and college and grad/professional school, I honestly suggest a change of attitude. It only sucks if  approached from such a  frame of mind. If approached from the perspective that abstract knowledge is unique to man and is an enjoyable activity in and of itself and not only because acquiring certain types of knowledge gives a person power and allows a greater earning potential and comfortable lifestyle, a student will  appreciate the incredible chance he has  to pursue knowledge. Acquiring knowledge becomes play time.  Colleges would rather see that an applicant availed himself of available opportunities and challenged himself rather than trying to game his GPA by taking easier classes. A "B" in an AP class is preferable to an "A" in a regular class. The students and teachers  an AP class attracts is usually reason enough  to take the AP class over the alternative. The GPA used for admissions purposes by most colleges and universities includes grades earned in academic classes taken in 10th and 11th grades. Taking the most challenging courses Senior year is a win win. The grades and AP test scores are not considered for  admissions decisions at most Universities and only first semester grades are usually potentially available even on appeal. This is for Berkeley, UCLA and the rest of the UC's but is typical:  http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/ad...    This is from the Naval Academy's website and again is typical:    "What courses should I take to make myself competitive for admission?        To improve your chances of qualifying scholastically, your high school preparation should include the following:      --mathematics-four years of mathematics courses, including a strong foundation in geometry, algebra, and trigonometry. Courses in pre-calculus and calculus are also very valuable and are highly encouraged.      --science-one year each of chemistry and physics, with lab if possible.      --English-four years of course work with special attention to the study and practice of effective writing. Surveys of English and American literature are especially helpful as background for future study of literature.      To further enhance your competitiveness for admission, the following courses are also recommended:      --foreign language-at least two years.      --history-one full year of U.S. history and, where possible, a full year of European or world history.      --introductory computer and typing courses are recommended because all midshipmen are required to use personal computers in most courses.    What Grade Point Average do I need to get an appointment?        There is no specific GPA minimum. However, you should strive to be at least in the top 20 percent of your high school class."  http://www.usna.edu/Admissions/faq.htm w...    Make sure you understand Algebra1 forwards, backwards and upside down. If you are taking it this year, ask for help for any areas you do not understand. Without a good foundation in Algebra 1 it is very difficult to do well in higher math and science classes. The same goes for Algebra 2.   Algebra 1, Algebra 2 and Geometry are tested on the SAT 1. English reading comprehension and writing are also tested on the SAT 1. Extracurricular reading will improve scores especially if done with a dictionary at hand looking up unknown words and writing down the meanings.  Schedule SAT 2 subject exams to coincide as nearly as possible with the Final or AP exam in the subject. This will save studying time by not having to spend time reviewing.    http://www.hotchkiss.org/documents/hkiss...  http://reading.berkeley.edu/  Get involved in a few extracurricular activities that allow you to show leadership potential. An athletic team and one other activity. Debate/ Forensics, Student Govt., School Newspaper, Drama, JROTC, Civil Air Patrol, Boy Scouts are all looked upon very favorably. Colleges don't want to see a huge number of activities but a few pursued in depth, where one was a class officer, team captain or held a similar leadership role. Get Involved! Also a certain amount of community service activity each year. It doesn't have to be a huge amount because colleges know students have limited time with school and extracurricular activities.   Good Luck!
N8DC9foaaa	I personally would choose subtraction method.... The purpose of that method is to find a number that you can multiply one of the equations by to cancel one of the variable when they are subtracted (or added).    If you multiple the top equation by 3 - this will become and easy problem:    3(4x - 5y = 14) would give us: 12x - 15y = 42    Put this with the next one:    12x - 15y = 42  -12x + 15y = -42    That will give us 0x - 0y = 0    Since it is 0 = 0, then they are the same line, answers are all real numbers.    Hope that helps!|`|uIqqC1Kaaa	No can do. There is only one distinct equation.  If you were to multiply the first equation by (-3), you would get the second equation:    (-3)(4x-5y=14)=  -12x+15y= -42    Since there is only one equation and 2 variables, the equation cannot be solved, x can be solved in terms of y, and vice versa, but no constant values can be assigned to x or y.

cebea3a8e8113acc7b540c298907a6c7aa	Aside from a spotless grammatical composition you need to install bit of your personality into the essay. As in great high school papers the teachers don't want the average cookie cutter essays, they want you to interest them. Make them sit on the edge of their seat with a raised eye brow. Insert your personality into the paper. Even if they don't agree with your philosophy, make them at least want to listen to yours. Shock radio used this to capture listeners and it has peaked and has now lost it's punch. However, the written word can use this technique also. No, don't say something outlandish! Just get them interested in who you are. Make them think, wow I need to see this person in the flesh.

zTnk59gGaa	Teaching (ESL/EFL/TESOL certification)  Business  Peace Corps  Translator  Public Relations  Politics  Medicine/Sciences (if you're good at Latin)  Others...    I'm sure you could get started after you get your Bachelor's (usually 4 years).     As for liking it... that really depends on your personality and what you like to do.     There is always a high demand for people who know more than one language (especially in the international field or even in America with the rise in legal/illegal immigration). If you want to teach, knowing more than one language is ALWAYS a plus. It'll always look good on any resume.     Hope this helps some!|`|MohdUxdOaa	You know you can go into almost anything.   I would suggest to "sell" timeshare companies.  go to the big ones like Marriot, Wyndham, Shell. Don't go to small crappy copanies that makes the whole thing sound like it is a scam.because of their unprofessionalism. You are goin to make thousands and thousands of dollars.Like,in hawaii, they are in dire need of someone who speaks Japanese.    Real Estate will be great for you too. And of course you will be handling some international market. BIG MONEY.    Japanese want to spend ther money in United States, but no one can talk to them abut all the good stuffs.

1Ru9GkTHaa	Incident in a Rose Garden: Donald Justice      Gardener  Sir, I encountered Death   Just now among our roses  Thin as a scythe he stood there.    I knew him by his pictures  He had on his black coat  Black gloves, and broad black hat.    I think he would have spoken,  Seeing his mouth stood open.  Big it was, with white teeth.    As soon as he beckoned, I ran.  I ran untill I found you.  Sir, I'm quitting my job.    I want to see my sons  Once more before I die.  I want to see California.    Master  Sir, you must be that stranger  Who threatened my gardener.  This is my property, sir.    I welcome only friends here.    Death  Sir, I knew your father.  And we were friends at the end.    As for your gardener,  I did not threaten him.  Old men mistake my gestures.        I only ment to ask him  To show me to his master.  I take it you are he?

WwWqONlkaa	hmm.. ok.. i'll tell you what I'm thinking of:  (don't say what the quote means. It implies that they're stupid.)    Robin Cook once said that education is more than a luxury; it is a responsibility that society owes to itself. When I hear those inspiring words I feel that Robin was really speaking to me, saying that it is my responsibility to seek education. To apply his advice to me, I seek the best place to find the best quality of education. College Academy is the road that would lead me directly to my future, not any future, but a bright future compatible with my ambitions.    As I am responsible of such self empowering task, I am also responsible of getting myself into this academy. Yes, I do think that education is a self empowering process. Education and knowledge is power, therefore; learning is "obtaining and receiving power."    Attending such academy is not a paved road to success, though. It's a road Robert Frost would describe as a "road less taken by." It's a rocky road, full of challenge. I am aware of that. I am ready for challenge. I am ready for competition. At the end, I'd be ready to reach success, but I would never be ready if I didn't earn it by effort.    I want to be accepted in this academy. It is a chance to be the person I have always pictured to be, a hardworking planner for a great future. If this academy wasn't my track to achieve my goals, I wouldn't have applied for it. However, I did. A step I will hopefully never regret doing.    (then write an ending.. have nothin in mind now)|`|oLI2SJ08aa	What's your essay supposed to be about? There must be some sort of prompt.

trKgx3Ukaa	Crawley is a suburb in metropolitan Perth. Perth is not considered a regional city, it is the capital city of Western Australia.    I am having a hard time finding a definition for regional, rural and remote in relation to locations. You can be sure however that unless the university is at least 90km or so from any state capital city it will not be regional.     An example of a regional university would be: U of Southern Queensland, U of Central Queensland, James Cook U,  Charles Sturt U, Deakin U. All of these are a long way from their state's capital city.     Hope this helps.|`|AA12074269	I would add Southern Cross University and University of New England to the above list as regional.

SLFt8eHEaa	You certainly have the academics to get in and it would be well worth applying.  Of course, most people who apply have those sorts of grades so it's hard to say for definite whether or not you'll get it, but you have a good chance.    First of all, don't worry about the extra-curriculars.  Oxford is a very academic institution and actually doesn't like to see too many extra-curriculars on your application as it makes you look as if you don't have enough devotion to your academic pursuits.  I went to Oxford and certainly didn't have as many extra-curriculars as you so I wouldn't recommend that you take on any more.  Sports are completely irrelevant; they're not going to help you solve a maths problem!    Other than grades, the key thing that tutors look for in an applicant is a passion for your subject and an understanding of it which is greater than the average student.  So for maths I would recommend things like reading the relevant journals, attending external seminars, that sort of thing.    And you're right in that Oxford students have to be disciplined.  Oxford isn't like other unis where you drink all night and all day, you actually have to work!  I'm now a corporate lawyer and these days I only work a few hours more a day than I did at Oxford!  This is why you need to show dedication to your academic pursuits - you need to show that you have the discipline to commit to the course for several years.|`|nfOxiQ2zaa	Seems pretty promising to me.    Although it all goes down to your actual marks.  If you get >90% in Maths, Further Maths and Physics, I'd say you have a better chance than most.    Like you have already mentioned too... Join a sport, and not just 'over the Summer'.  Start something now.  If you do it just over the Summer, it will stick out like a sore thumb that the only reason you joined is to write it down on your Personal Statement... Which might then make them doubt other things.

You can listen to the mp3 there for free.  It's silly, but it helps!  I am almost 25 now and still remember them because of this song.    Here are the words for the first 16 presidents anyway:    chorus:  These are the presidents. Mighty, mighty presidents. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.    1. The Father of our Country, George Washington was "one."  "Two" was John Adams, then Thomas Jefferson. Then  was James Madison, and also James Monroe.  And John Quincy Adams was number six, you know.     repeat chorus    2. Andrew Jackson was the seventh in line.  Then Martin Van Buren followed Andy's time.  William Henry Harrison was next at number nine.  John Tyler, James Polk; the states were doin' fine.     repeat chorus    3. Zachary Taylor, Millard Fillmore, Franklin Pierce;  As James Buchanan left, things were getting pretty fierce.  Abraham Lincoln went to war so we could be  One nation living in peace and liberty.     repeat chorus

jER0X5OPaa	That's a good question. I can't give you any facts or sources, but in my opinion, it is generally good because it helps to compare every applicant across an equal board. Most schools will not only look at your test score when considering your admission. For example, say you have a really high GPA, but you scored low on the ACT, then while it does hurt a little, your good GPA helps and shows that you do work hard, but maybe you aren't the best test taker. Since schools consider a multitude of aspects, if you are a bad test taker, it will not make or break your decision.     It is also beneficial because different high schools function differently, and again, it puts everyone on an even playing field. Bad teachers or classes that are easy at one school but hard at another won't really come into play with the test. I don't know about the SAT, but the ACT at least is more about your processing skills than how much you've memorized.    Just my humble opinion, though.

Y8rB9iuHaa	I'm 54 years old and i still don't know what i want to do.    Whatever you do... avoid stupid subjects like media studies.  They are just designed to make the school look good in the league tables and are of absolutely no use to you.    Go for the sciences.  Maths is essential!|`|	im in yr 9 too but i dont know what to pick for my options and i dont know what i want to be either    everyone keeps going on about how theres alot of time left    'btw its not about what other people want you to do, its about what you want to do' |`|	hmm...well find your strengths. if you enjoy a subject a lot, you'll do well in it.|`|	Ask your teacher to help you with this at noon or at a break one day soon.|`|	Don't worry too much about not knowing what you want to be just yet, its good to keep yours options open. Im in college and still unsure of what i want to do.     Business is always a good subject to take as it looks at finance and how companys work, really easy too.     Foreign language as this is always what employers look for, even tough i didnt do this and its meant to be quite hard.     Food is a good one to take as you will gain your food hygeine certificate     Ict as you will need ict skills whatever job you go into and its a skill that is looked for.     Art, shows your creative and can think of new ideas too.     Good luck|`|	at this age it is hard to know leave it for later then you will know what are you interested to be in future.|`|	maths science and languages are good subjects. lots of cash in trades too|`|	choose what you enjoy, and use the connexions website that might give you some direction|`|	try to take a combination of subjects that you are good at and ones that you enjoy. I'd say maths, science and english are pretty essential, but beyond that most subjects are useful. there's no point in taking something you hate as you're not likely to do a lot of work for it.  even if after a couple of weeks you feel like you've made the wrong decision you can probably change it.     are there any staff at your school who you could talk through your choices with? They'd probably be able to give you more personal advice.    don't worry about not knowing what you want to do yet - i'm at uni now, and have no idea what i'm going to to afterwards. the good thing is most subjects teach you skills that can be applied to many different jobs. Most career paths allow for people with many different qualifications.  if you want to explore career options, maybe you could organise some work experience during the easter/summer holidays.|`|	I recommend taking a career planning class, I know they have them at our school but I don't know about other schools. It's not that big of a deal if you don't know what you want to be yet, I don't know either but I'm also a freshman. Best of luck.|`|	Definitely look at everything you do and don't enjoy doing.  And just take it from there.     But you really don't have to decide right now. My cousin didn't decide until her second year of college. So don't worry.|`|	nobody wants to know what they wanna be.  even when you start university or collge, you might now know.  thats what happend to my brother.  he was majoring something in unii, and he desnt like it at all.  so hes swiching now and wasted his first year on something he hates.    it'll come to you.    OR  you can go to careercruising  and sign in with your schools user and stuff, but if you dont know it , im sure if you look on here someone gave the passs away.  and take the quiz and it'll tell you some things that might intrest you.|`|	I'm in my second year at uni, I still don't know! The important thig is that you pick things that you enjoy and pick a balance. I'd suggest English, Maths, a language and double science (or at least two individual sciences). The rest is completely up to you. Pick the things that youmost enjoy and you think you might like to study at A Level.     The subject itself really doesn't matter at GCSE, as long as you think you will enjoy it for two years, pick it!!
3crV33rPaa	look here its there i think   http://jeff560.tripod.com/words6.html
3MbgHvLWaa	Here is an official website for the PSAT exam & you can see how high your score is. For a junior in igh school; you qualify for selection for a possible scholarship with a score of 147 or better. You score of 192 is much higher than that. You have an excellent chance of getting accepted at any college you apply to. Furthermore, I would make sure that you get selected for their scholarship program since your score is so high. Check with your academic counselor at your school or the poeple that administered you the exam so that you can be selected as a finalist for the scholarship & GOOD LUCK!    Scores & Review  Information on the Score Report  PSAT/NMSQT scores are reported on a scale of 20 to 80. In 2008, the average score for eleventh graders was about 47 in Critical Reading, 49 in Mathematics, and 46 in Writing Skills. The average score for tenth graders was about 42 in Critical Reading, 44 in Mathematics, and 41 in Writing Skills.    Also listed on your score report is the Selection Index, which is used to determine eligibility in National Merit Scholarship Corporation programs (NMSC). It is the sum of the three scores in each test section (CR + M + W). The Selection Index ranges from 60 to 240. The average Selection Index for students in eleventh grade is about 147. Note: Only students in eleventh grade are eligible to enter NMSC scholarship programs.    Finally, score reports include national percentiles, which allow you to compare your scores with other students in your grade level who have taken the PSAT/NMSQT. If you take the PSAT/NMSQT in the eleventh grade, you receive junior percentiles. If you take the PSAT/NMSQT in tenth grade or younger, you will receive sophomore percentiles. For example, a student in eleventh grade with a percentile of 55 has earned a score better than 55 percent of all eleventh graders. Another way to understand percentiles is to imagine 100 students lined up from the lowest (or 1st) percentile at the end of the line to the highest (or 99th) percentile at the front of the line. If you are at the 55th percentile, you would be the 56th person in line, ahead of 55 people in the line and behind 44. Go to Score Report Plus for more information about your score report.|`|oLI2SJ08aa	What furtherfall said isn't actually true. Being a National Merit Semifinalist isn't a guarantee of anything. In my state, semifinalists get nothing for going to state schools. You have to be a finalist and even then, it's $3,000, not a full ride. It really depends on where you live.    That being said, 192 is pretty good, sophomore or not. It depends on your state as to what the cutoff is for semifinalist status (it was around 215 in my state when I took it my junior year). If you're Black, you could be considered for the National Achievement Scholarship Program. Their cutoff is a bit lower than the National Merit program. I believe there is also something for Hispanics, but I'm not sure. Just study for it for next year and you should be able to get at least a 200.|`|462fed2fe3ce1f4bcba1e73bb0da97adaa	yes that is super good!!!!!

AA10754658	From what I hear, the food is fairly decent. There are quite few places on campus that accept the OneCard (Ryerson swipe-card-thingy) too, so that's handy. They have offer three meals a day. A lot of people say that even with the lowest meal plan, they still have tonnes of money left over each month. Also, remember that you're in the heart of Toronto -- you're just a 5-minute walk from the Eaton Centre, 20-minute walk to China Town, etc.    Best bet: visit the university (if you can) and just eat around, you don't have to be a student to buy food from the establishments.    http://www.ryerson.ca/studentservices/ho...  http://www.ryerson.ca/studentservices/ho...

nAN7lb6Gaa	A prime number doesn't have any factor except 1 and itself.  The set which you referred to is the set containing numbers which are multiples of five.  Its the following set:  A = {10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35}    Neither of the above is a prime number. Because they are all at least divisible by 5 and themselves. Only 5 is a number which is a prime number and a multiple of five(itself), and it is not included in the set you have referred to.  So there are zero prime numbers in the set. Or, the set which contains the prime numbers divisible by 5 in the above (A) set is a null set.|`|uIqqC1Kaaa	The only prime factor that is a multiple of 5 is 5. Being any multiple of 5 is not a prime number, which eliminates the possibility of being a prime factor. Since 5 is not included in the set, the answer is 0.|`|1khVEE6oaa	If they're multiples of 5 then there are 0.  They can't be prime and divisible by 5 (except for the number 5 itself, which is not included in your set of numbers).    Remember prime numbers are only divisible by themselves and 1.  The multiples of five between 7 and 37 are:    10, 15, 20, 25, 30, and 35    None of the above numbers is prime because each of them is divisible by five, themselves, and one.  Most of them have other factors as well.    ANSWER: 0|`|janeqyBHaa	I don't think there is any, because if the number is a multiple of 5, it's not prime because 5 is a factor.

Well, maybe you never did, but in my case, making videos might not be new to me, however this program I never used before is a whole new experience. What makes it a "truly new experience" is that I have also never spoke about what I'm about to talk about, NEW MOON! (Twilight Saga).    Obviously, as most already know, the new moon in New Moon glows and shines mainly on our favorite couple, or maybe our least favorite, Bella and Jacob. Does Bella's pain justifies her company of Jacob? Well, Edward left her, and Jacob was the reason she SURVIVED. A little credit please for Jacob! At least he kept the story continuing.    You know, I am aware that the one and only Taylor Lautner plays the role of Jacob, and I'm sorry to say that the video I have about him wasn't enough to put in mine.    About Steven Strait, I hope he IS straight because recently he seems to be every girls' dream! He attracted many and made the movie very successful.    I thank you for watching this!

QohWFO5daa	In America there is typically more flooding towards the end of the river in developed areas. There in more run-off along the way and the water gains speed - leading to more flooding further down stream. Also, the ends of rivers tend to be in more flat/even land (such as flood plains) giving more room for the water to spread while the starts of rivers are typically on steeper angels.    So, no, there would not be more floods at the start of a river.

ST7WcWfsaa	Nothing is hard, as far as the subjects are concerned. Rather, it is us who make things harder. What appears to be "hard" to us, is actually our lack of interest, weak ability to comprehend specific knowledge, and lack of willingness/desire to study those subjects in detail. With that said, since you have now switched to Business (from Engineering), it is of surety that you had shown little interest/understanding / willingness towards extensive Mathematical & Scientific work, required in most of Engineering majors. Hence, your withdrawal from Engineering. As for Business, it is recommended that you must show strong emotions towards Statistics & 'basic' Calculus in order to succeed in Financial/Managerial Accounting, which by the way, is interrelated to Financial Engineering.     No one should switch their majors all because of one professor. Please seek availability of different locations or instructors, as far as the question of lack of proper teaching is concerned. Just as how Business can be "hard" for an A+ Chemistry student, so too, Chemistry can be  just as hard for an A+ Business student. Both subjects can become "easy" for both students, provided that they possess strong ability/willingness to show interest towards the subjects they consider to be hard. Don't be afraid, sir. Doing comparison-analysis will not help much.|`|lQIKWXDuaa	If you love math and you have a good instructor not hard at all.     ss|`|Lr82Itoyaa	it is not harder, in fact, it is one of the easiest subjects ever  the only thing is, IT IS EXTREMELY BORING    i take accounting currently (i am a freshman in highschool)|`|JMOvQhIGaa	no
N9qssHj1aa	For the classroom, no. If you are teaching English it's best to speak English all the time so that your students get used to hearing real English and in order to communicate with you they MUST speak English. Even if you know the local language, you should only allow English in your classroom.     But, it can help outside the classroom for basic everyday chores like shopping and getting around town. A few weeks in a new country however will have you speaking one or two words though so it's nothing to worry about.|`|VrwM9Oiiaa	You don't need to know another language. You start with teaching basics (vocabulary mostly) and then move to grammar. In some cases there's a teacher's assistant who speaks your students' native language and will help you explain. But from my experience, it's possible to teach grammar without speaking students' native language.
lQIKWXDuaa	No way. It could also mean that they will accept you via regular admission or on the waiting list.

reHRXlZCaa	In the UK, it is currently government policy to include children with special educational needs (across the spectrum, not just Autistic) in mainstream school where possible but there are special schools run by Councils and by private companies which may deal with specific needs.  How a child with special educational needs (SEN) is placed is determined by a number of factors, parents views, the child's needs, whether or not there are enough places in the special schools.    <br>  <br>  It's laid down in British law how special educational needs should be dealt with - for instance, every school is required to have a Special Educational Needs Co-ordinator (SENCO) to deal with SEN within schools.  Acts of interest here would be the Education Act 1996 and Children's Act 2004.  There's also the Disability Discrimination Act which protects the rights of children with disabilities within schools.  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Parents/Schoolslearninganddevelopment/SpecialEducationalNeeds/DG_4000690" rel="nofollow">http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Parents/Scho...</a><br>  <br>  Every local council also has a dedicated special educational needs section and there are various services that the state schools can access in their local councils. <br>  <br>  A staged approach is taken to SEN, stages 1 & 2 are dealt with at school level.  Stage 1, the SENCO identifies the child's needs and put the necessary measures in place. At Stage 2, the child may need services from outside the school.  At Stage 3, the child's need may be beyond what the school and external agencies can provide so a further assessment of the child's needs can be requested from the local council which may or may not result in a document called a Statement of Special Educational Needs being issued - this is a legal document which lays down what support and services a child may need.  Most schools do have teaching assistants and if required they can access additional training to help them deal with Autistic children.   <br>  <br>  There are a number of charities, some specialiasing in particular needs such as Autism - National Autisitic Society (NAS), for instance, which provides support & advice to parents, it also runs both day & residential schools.  There are also a number of private tutors & organisations offering an intensive tuition for children with Autism called ABA (Applied Behavioural Analysis) - Treehouse School in Haringey employs this method of teaching.<br>  <br>  I think UK has a good system, I know people will disagree with me but I feel under the British system every child has value, their right to an education regardless of circumstance is enshrined in law but the thing is, a parent/school needs to know how to work the system to get maximum value from it for their child - not every child will be lucky enough to stumble into a school that will fight for them or understand how the system works so they can help the child, not every child with SEN will have a parent who is clued up enough to know where to start to look for help.     <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  |`|5319529690edf313d843743d4cacfc1baa	I am from Australia if the child is accessed as a 6 they can go to a special school.  <br>  I boy with autism did normal high school subjects and wrote the school news letters.  <br>  They had a teachers for another one boy with behaviour problems <br>  <br>  Voluteered doing art with students from the school<br>  <br>  note there is high and low funiction autism and no two are effected the some way|`|1592c885f8b61569e0e0bc02442d574caa	My daughter has a six year old Autistic son who is in mainstream school and has been statemented since he was 4.Its a constant battle for her making sure he gets what he`s entitled to.The school are not really coping with his behaviour as he also has ADHD..containable and manageable is one way they described the situation..He is very disruptive,has no friends and finds coping with noise very difficult.he`s a little darling for his grandma though and he brings a smile to my face everytime I see him..|`|N2JkgQ4Uaa	I have aspergers syndrome which is on the autistic spectrum or whatever<br>  In Britain there are special boarding schools run by the "Priory" which specialises in autism, aspergers syndrome and whatnot<br>  There are also many "Special Need" schools<br>  <br>  I know for a fact my mother had to fight a long time to get me into the education I am in now and considering I am not badly affected I worry about people who have severe difficulties <br>  <br>  I think Aspergers and Autism are only really becoming accepted into Society and people are starting to see this IS a problem.

Like you we seem to face exactly the same problems with education. Speak to most parents who have a child with autism and the majority will say they feel their childs needs are not being fully met. The help these children get very often does not come automatically and parents have to fight for it. A lot of groups in the UK are trying to raise the profile of autism and the difficulties people who have it face. Teachers in the UK do not get nearly enough training on any learning difficulty and when they are fully qualified they usually have very large class sizes. There are specialist schools that just take in kids with autism but all of these schools are run by private companies and parents have to find funding to send their children to these, not surprisingly most local authorities are unwilling to pay for children to attend these schools. Like many other countries we lobby our government for more awareness and more funding for these special children who have so much to give.|`|OVmzkRTOaa	Here in the UK it is a mixed bag. There are some very good schools set up specifically for children on the spectrum. There are also some autistic units which are based in mainstream schools and these enable their students to have specialised structure and support in their own classrooms while benefiting from mixing and socialising with mainstream peers.<br>  There is a geographical lottery here though, if you live in an inner city area there is likely to be a wider range of support services and early interventions available whereas those in more rural communities have nothing.<br>  It is still an uphill struggle to get a diagnosis and then to get a statement of special educational needs that fully addresses the requirements for supporting the child.<br>  It is improving but the progress is painfully slow!

ORonhAuvaa	You really need to do Applied Behavior Analysis because many of the problems that kids with those diagnoses have is difficulty with communication.     With ABA you will be teaching him to ask for what he wants and to accept "not now."     Reward systems do not work if there is a problem with one of the following, Immediacy, Satiation and Desirability. I suspect your problem with reinforcement may have to do with immediacy and desirability. 6 year olds cannot wait all day to be reinforced, even if you are using stickers as token economy. He may not be able to see that getting X amount of stickers = something at the end of the day.    I would use primary reinforcers (The actual reinforcer) at first, which for children with autism is not easy. Sit down with your child and find out what he finds reinforcing and make a visual reinforcement menu.     Reinforce every ten minutes with something minor, like playing with bubbles for two minutes or a couple of goldfish and then increase the frequency to fifteen minutes and a slightly bigger reinforcer. Continues to lengthen the time and vary the reinforcer. Being reinforced once an hour may be too long for him. Any time he backslides, you have either lengthened the time too quickly or satiated him with the reinforcer      The other key is teaching your child the behavior that you want to have to replace the problem behavior. Say he tantrums when you tell him "No." At a time when you are both relaxed and not mad, tell him that you and he are going to play a behavior game. Tell him that you want to show him a new way of responding when you tell him "No."    Making sure you have his reinforcer at hand, role model for him how you would like him to act when he can't have what he wants. Now you play him. Have him tell you "No," and show the good behavior. Have him reinforce you and then switch roles. Switch again and this time you tantrum. Ask him if you should get a reward for the tantrum. Then role model and have him reinforce your good behavior. Take turns and have fun! Do this every day until you start seeing the behavior in context when you tell him "No."    The thing that most people do is fail to teach the replacement behavior. They are very good at telling the kid what he is doing wrong, but they really don't reinforce him when he does things right. When you are trying to think of a replacement behavior to teach, think, "What would I want him to do instead?" Then teach that behavior.    These techniques are part of ABA. If you go to Dr. Mac's Amazing Behavior Analysis Page, you can read more about it.            We teach kids to go on the potty, we teach them to read, but we punish behavior. Does that make sense?|`|jgYhKaACaa	my class is 3 and 4 year olds but one of our kids is 5 and two of our kids are on the token system where they earn 5 stars then get two minutes with a choice or a reward to play with for two minutes and one of those is in food therapy where the child takes 5 bites and then gets a special toy to play with for 2 minutes.  not sure if this is something you would want to try but maybe start with 6 stars when he does things like sitting nicely in his chair at school for 20 minutes for one star and so on. when he gets his stars maybe he gets to play with something he likes for 5 or 10 minutes.  you said you had used a reward system similar to this before and it didn't work but maybe he needs some shorter goals to start working towards at first before extending it to the end of the day.  you can also search behavior management on the internet and get some decent hits.   this is my first year using the token system with two of our severe non-compliant kids but it seems to be working well so far. the thing to remember is to encourage him on the positive side he is at the age where he knows he is different from his peers and it causes some self esteem issues as well which leads to behavior sometimes. but good luck!|`|mx3gFmIKaa	My son is 8, he's got several dx's that are similar to your sons including PDD.NOS, ADD.NOS and others but he's probably bipolar.    Last year he had a point card where he was able to get a puzzle piece every 8 minutes when he stayed on task and after 4 of them (32 minutes) he could cash in for 10 minutes of preferred activity time.    I found when my son was having difficulties the shorter interval helped reinforce good behaviors well.    His pointcard was discontinued because he was doing ok, last year though his kindergarten teachers said he would have difficulty with first grade.  He repeated kindergarten and his behaviors and speech/social delays were why, he is doing well now.|`|f3f09dd5dab69f7e644b37c4cf98a3abaa	small segment rewards - and rewards are either positive or neutral - praise and support the behavior you want - and ignore the behavior you do want.    Don't talk anything to death - use short one word answers and be sure you have taught him what he is supposed to do directly - not just yell or tell him what he should not do.      Pick one system and work it for several weeks - don't try one day of this and one of that - consistancy is what you need.|`|PnlgLBcwaa	besides focusing onthe behavior itself--look at what triggers the behavior--and see if you cna modify that....by giving more breaks, etc...|`|50WCN0graa	Here are some ideas that I have seen a lot of success with:    1) Social Stories: A social story is a story that you read to the child to prepare them to handle a specific activity that they struggle with (ie: following directions, solving conflict, getting in line, etc). There are books you can buy with "ready-made" social stories to use with kids. I often create my own, personalized stories for kids that uses their name and addresses their specific behaviors.    I have kids read the story BEFORE they encounter situations they typically struggle with or I have them read it at the start of each day to remind them how to handle the situations before they occur. When you illustrate the books, it is great if you can take actual pictures of your child doing "the right thing." He is more likely to relate and replicate the behavior if he can seem himself doing it... plus, he will probably think this is fun. Here are some sites with examples and further explanation:    http://www.polyxo.com/socialstories/    http://www.ehow.com/how_4479088_write-so...    http://portal.creativetherapystore.com/p...    2) Behaviors Plan: It sounds like you are doing this. Just thought I would share some tricks of the trade that I have learned along the way in implementing behavior plans (many of my plans failed until I learned these things):    **Choose 1 and only 1, very specific goal. For example, Johnny will follow directions or Johnny will wait his turn to speak and not interrupt. Once Johnny is successful and seems to be meeting his goal regularly, you can slowly begin adding additional goals. You must reward Johnny if he achieves his goal... even if he does something else during the day you don't like. It is unfair to withhold the reward if he achieved the goal, even if he made another bad choice. This will confuse him and decrease the success of the plan.    ** Once you choose a goal, very clearly define and describe to your son what the goal means. Do not assume he knows, because he probably doesn't. For example: Following directions means: when I arrive at school I put away my book bag and get out my morning work, I listen to the teacher or my parents when they are explaining directions and do what they say, if I don't understand the directions I raise my hand and ask for help... think about your sons specific behaviors, so you can very specifically instruct him as to how to achieve the goal.... kids with autism don't disregard rules because they want to be bad and don't care... they do it because they don't "get it." It is important to clearly describe to your son what you want him to do... what does it look like to follow directions (what would you see him doing if you walked in his classroom and saw him following directions?)    **Give frequent rewards and feedback. A sticker may not be enough. When I have children with severe behavioral problems, I give them special watches that I have set to vibrate every 30 minutes throughout the school day. When their watch vibrates, they raise their hand and ask their teacher if they achieved their goal during the 30 minute time frame. If the teacher has time, it is helpful if he/she can tell the child, specifically, why they did or did achieve the goal.    If they achieve the goal, they can put a sticker on their chart. If they earn 4/5 stickers by lunch (varies by child.... if they can never seem to accomplish 4/5, then the goal should be 3/5 or even 2/5... goal must be challenging, but realistic), ie: time on the computer, bouncy ball, play a game (your child should be involved in choosing the reward so that it is motivating for him..... this is very important. If the reward isn't motivating, he won't try to earn it.    After lunch, we start again... if the child can earn 4/5 stickers by the end of the day, he gets another reward.    **As the child is successful with their plan we can make it more challenging by: increasing how many stickers they must earn, lengthening the time frame for feedback (ie: from 30 to 45 minutes), or adding additional goals to the plan.    **When trying to decide what goal to focus on first.... choose the behavior that is either most annoying or destructive to you or his classroom teacher.    **State his goal in positive, not negative terms.... this teaches the child what he SHOULD DO rather than what he should not do and it is more encouraging. For example, instead of saying, "Johnny will not use unkind words or hit others" say "Johnny will use kind words and keep his hands to himself. Then, you go on to describe that for him... give examples of what kind words are, explain that keeping hands to self means you don't touch others without their permission, etc.    **Give as much encouragement as you possibly can. When he achieves his goal, say thing like "wow, you did a great job. You must of have really followed directions today. How did you do it? You should feel proud inside for being such a good direction follower. I know I feel great when I follow directions. How do you feel?" This will help him take the "extrisic" (rewards) to the "instrnsic" (feeling good inside for doing the right thing).    When he messes up, talk about it, ask him how he would like to try and change his behavior tomorrow and remind him that everybody messes up and tomorrow is a new day. If he gets too discouraged, he will give up. He needs to know he is not bad and that the adults in his life believe in him. Most likely, he isn't happy with his behavior either (even if he pretends not to care).    ** Drill him on the goal, especially in|`|6cUPKr7Paa	My son is on an herbal regimen of Colloidal Minerals, Digestive Bitters Tonic, GABA Plus, and Serotonin.

Ahora bien, nosotros estamos concientes de que los resultados de estas pruebas con Cuantitativas y no Cualitativas, es decir lo unico que nos proprcionan es un "número" que si es bien interpretado y explicado a la persona que aplico las pruebas, puede ser de gran ayuda para modificar de manera positiva el comportamiento, habilidades y actitudes de una persona. Ademas, asi como da puntajes globales, tambien da puntajes por separado en varias areas, por lo que por loo general asi como hay puntajes altos, tambien hay areas evaluadas con puntajes bajos.<br>  Por otro lado este estudio lo debemos entender y asi lo entendemos nosotros como solo una parte de lo que conforma al ser humano, ya que un puntaje alto en tu CI o IQ acompa?ada por una muy baja o carente Inteligencia Emocional, pues de nada te sirve este IQ alto.  Cuando nosotros aplicamos esta prueba que mide el IQ, consideramos preciso evaluar persoanlidad, caracter, intereses y aptitudes, entendiendo siempre al ser humano como un ser biopsicosocial y que en ningun momneto se puede dividir o entenderlo como mente sin cuerpo o viceversa o entenderlo afuera de una sociedad.<br>  <br>  En conclusión el resultado de medir el IQ y como este es tomado por la persona evaluada, no solo tiene que ver con la persona misma, sino tambien tiene que ver mucho con la o las personas que te evaluen y que interpreten los resultados. Yo te recomendaria mucho y si estas interesada en conocer tu IQ que te acerques siempre a gente profecional: Pedagogos, Psicopedagogos, Psicologos Educativos.<br>  <br>  Hay gente que busca el camino facil y recurre a aplicaciones de pruebas por internet o en sitios web, por que es mas facil, es mas barato y no ocupa tanto tiempo....ovbiamente los resultados seran baratos, poco confiables y por ende perjudiciales para aquellos que obtienen un supuesto resultado de IQ o vocacional. Cuando se trata del conocimiento propio no hay que escatimar esfuerzos. <br>  <br>  Si tienes alguna otra duda sobre este tema o algun otro, no dudes en poreguntarnos. Estamos para servirles.<br>  visitanos en www.iqpedagogos.com.mx<br>  Suerte!!!|`|GIZSnzsZaa	Pues por mi parte no creo que afecten, sino al contrario, a mi me gustaria que me los aplicaran, porque mas que para conocer quien es mas inteligente que otro, es para saber si se cuenta con los conocimientos basicos en lógica y sentido comun, porque algunos resultados son tan malos que se han detectado ni?os que no razonan porque tienen problemas mentales.|`|XP3TK4nVaa	Estos examenes deben estar bien elaborados dependiendo del sector al que se van a aplicar. Miden el coeficiente intelectual, pero les falta medir el emocional. <br>  El ser humano logra aciertos por todas sus habilidades (acadèmicas, sociales, emocionales, etc.) y faltarìa medir esto otro.<br>  PD
SKX7nMvCaa	Pues yo estoy estudiando Psicología y he hecho tests de personalidad y la verdad si es algo muy, pero muy complejo si lo quieres hacer bien.<br>  Pero mira, los que son válidos realmente no te los van a pasar en Internet ya que no son gratuitos, son pruebas estandarizadas y que requieren muchos a?os y muchas pruebas para su correcta aplicación y correctos resultados, basados estos es formulas estadisticas, para no hacerte el cuento largo son un 99.9% fiables, solo que estos los tienes que hacer a mano y te los cobran regularmente; los haces a mano para poder analizar hasta que tan fijas estan tus respuestas en el papel o si borras o cosas asi, cosas que a veces una computadora no detecta, un psicologo puede ver hasta tus emociones al ver una pregunta.<br>  El que es mayormente utilizado por psicologos y profesionales, es el MMPI-2, asi que si solo es para jugar y divertirte, busca uno en Internet, pero si quieres ir en serio, busca a un psicologo que te lo haga, de preferencia clínico, pues son los que conocen mas acerca de psicopatología y pueden apreciar mas detalles en tu personalidad.<br>  <br>  Espero que esto te haya servido y si tienes mas preguntas no  dudes en escribirme.<br>  <br>  Suerte!|`|8836azk4aa	Pues lo mejor un psicologo personal<br>  <br>  Y si no tienes que contestar en base a analisis todas las preguntas que viene el tes y no contestar solo por contestar<br>  <br>  <a href="http://es.answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AsQA.iMQClhAl2V_GcPe2DBo.gt.;_ylv=3?qid=20080727153112AA3NHOx">http://es.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a><br>  <br>  Me ayudas?|`|KHVfhQjzaa	el teste de personalidad no te dice nada mas de lo que ya sabes o de lo que los demas miran de una persona , la de prueba en linea son un asco por que bien puede ser una persona honesta y le sale un resultado bastante bueno como las personas mentirosas e hipocritas que nomas asen alboroto por que son personas nice !! <br>  sorry  no me gustan los test de personalidad para tomarlos en serio solo como un actividad relativa<br>  XD suerte  =P|`|MRdwo7ezaa	Creo que se puede confiar, pero hasta cierto punto, según yo, otorgan cierta orientación, algunos razgos generales de la persona, pero nada muy completo.<br>  He visto muchos y muy variados, en algunos los resultados no tienen nada que ver en cuanto a como soy  y mi comportamiento, por eso los tomo como algo ligero, no para basarme en ellos, sí para entretenerme un rato.

tQsxsuNPaa	Go to CSIET.  They have a list of the best programs in the US.  I'm not sure what a "twin one" is.      Perks are you get to live in a completely different home and culture, you make new friends you would never meet any other way.  You get to learn a new language, and experience things you never would, and that with a good program, you are pretty safe.    Lows...homesickness.  Sometimes the family match isn't so good.  And in extreme cases, the student can run into troubles...I had a student who went abroad...her situation was unusual; she was moved around a bit to a couple of countries, and she wound up rather confused.  She had no control over her life and got with a not so good boyfriend, and ultimately developed anorexia, as a method of coping with an inability to control anything else.  I think she came home early, because she needed medical help.  This is a REALLY extreme case.  If your child goes, make sure she knows that she can tell you ANYTHING, if things are or are not going well, that you are there to hear her, and that she needs to let you know if she is unhappy.      I also know two situations where the students who came to my high school had problems.  One girl simply couldn't get along with ANYONE!!!  She was moved several times from one family to another in an effort to find a family that could handle her.  And another young lady, who wasn't used to picking up after herself...she was from an extremely rich family and had a personal maid.  Being expected to make her own bed in the morning was such a strain that she went home crying after about a week!     In contrast, I know of MANY happy stories...one family I knew had a girl come stay with them, then sent their daughter to her country...a year later, the younger brothers swapped homes back and forth.  A year later, whole families were crossing the ocean to visit each other.     I have a friend who is in her 50s.  Her exchange family invited her to their daughter's wedding a few years back.  They are still in touch and have visited back and forth many times.    And I know of situations that are everything in between as well.|`|ClNaqjYEaa	Check out Youth for Understanding.  They have many options.  I did a high school exchange with them to Germany about 11 years ago.  Mine was for an entire year.  They do summer programs too.  It's an excellent experience!  I learned so much.  Now I am bilingual and teach high school German.  I believe their website is www.yfu.org   You can check out their programs there. It looks great on a resume and can open up many doors. Good luck!

Top/2nd set means class types, correct? Higher level learning, and normal level?  Y9 is....freshmen year?    Law doesn't "require" any pre-set classes. Just get the credits required to graduate. But I would say if you can, take a psychology course.

AuwCgpd4aa	Are you sure you don't mean yourself? It's okay. I used to have few friends until I did everything I'm saying BELOW    vv    Just be yourself, (or at least a watered-down version of yourself).  Be friendly, but don't get nosy in other people's business and don't stalk others.   When someone says something bad about someone else, NEVER get in the conversation. Keep all bad thoughts about other people in your school to yourself, as stuff like that spreads like wildfire, and then you'll have no friends. Keep away from drugs and sex, as drugs are never cool and sex is something you should do when you're an adult and in love (hey, I never said you had to be married).  Go out and do social things, like parties and get involved in sports and activities that'll put you around other people. I tend to get closer with people I identify with. I know it sounds clique-y but I tend to be around the smarter people like myself more, and we have our own group. But if you DO become part of a group, try to remain individualistic and never exclude others, as it hurts their feelings.|`|YEHkJf5faa	There is NOTHING to worry about. Middle school is fun and easy.

eec61b9791496ca2bff48e78593ac3beaa	I think there are a number of schools that offer Geneder Studies - Berkeley, Santa Cruz, etc.  They may not offer a specific graduate program though.  You'll have to research it.    You absolutely can apply to graduate programs outside of your undergrad major.  You have to be prepared enough to do the work though, so you can't go into nuclear engineering with an anthro degree. GS should be no problem.    Good luck finding a job.
UxooffHZaa	Temple is a bigger university, and it's programs are more respected. Either should have good internship opportunities, as they are both in large cities. (Philadelphia and Baltimore, respectively) I'd say visit Temple and UMBC, and meet with some of the professors, see their building, etc... Then make your own mind up. What works for one person, it not right for another. College is much more about a match of style than which is straight up "better."
quTXEzTVaa	New Jersey v. T.L.O was a legal precedent in which the Supreme Court upheld the right of a school to perform searches on students without a warrant. This was their holding.    "School officials are State agents when enforcing disciplinary rules mandated by law. Officials may search without a warrant using reasonable suspicion of a violation of the law or school rules."    Since Jake Smith was acting in a way that the school deemed suspicious, it was perfectly legal for school officials to search his locker without a warrant.|`|Z5bXE2faaa	Did Jake arouse suspicion, or was there a reason behind the search?  Schools are public areas controlled by the government, so I believe it's legal for school faculty to make the search...though there are certain restrictions.  So yes, I would believe the school has the right to search lockers under suspicion or without reason.  However, you can't destroy other people's property in the process without just-cause.    For example, sometimes police dogs are brought in schools to sniff out possible drugs hidden within students' lockers.    I would look up the fourth amendment.  You can surely find many examples, such as your story, and ways to argue your case.    Good luck!

UerUtbICaa	I'm a junior at SJU now and I was in the same situation when I got accepted and wanted to go.  I had a laptop before i left and received there's.  I just gave my little brother the St. John's Laptop and used my own.  When they say programs they just mean PowerPoint, Excel, MS Word, etc.  No big deal, the only thing you'll have to do is take your SJU Laptop and your Mac to I.T. so they can hook up your internet connection to the SJU wireless network.  (You're only allowed one laptop to be connected to the wireless, i.e. why they need to disable it from the SJU laptop and move it to the personal computer.)  Hope this helps|`|Fu1emcF3aa	Hey I got accepted there too and I'm probably going there.    No, I don't think we are "required" to use them.    That would be pretty stupid.    However I'm going to be using it because I cannot afford to buy my own laptop lol.    Good luck in St. John's.    EDIT: Oh I get what you're saying... Maybe the software is for like online classes and stuff?? OR something similar to that.. Like study programs for the computer o0r something.    I'm pretty sure you could use it on any computer. Many kids will be getting laptops at graduation so yes, it would be very silly for them to require the IBM's. Thew software will probably just be a CD that you can put on any computer.    Good luck!
lQIKWXDuaa	Talk to a counselor at your school. We have no clue what your interest are? What subject you are stronger in? Is it math, science, humanities etc...    My best advice to you is think about what you like. Do you like the humanities, science, math, health, computer science. Then once you know what subject you like take different classes in that subject to see which ones comes natural to you. For example, if you like science there is Biology, chemistry, geology, physic etc.... Then, once you figure out what you like major in it. Also in terms of job, start looking at the different jobs that you can do in that particular field. Again if you like science then you can probably go into nursing, medicine, public health, research, teaching etcc... I will say once you know what you want to major in do internship before committing to a career choice after you graduate. Internships will give you a feel about your potential career. Also think about what kind of income you would like to earn. Then again once you find your passion the money wont matter. Good luck!!!!!!!!    In terms of school, I will suggest starting with a community college as well. You might have a hard time getting into a four school. Apply to both community college and a four year college. If you get into a four chose that one. Good Luck!!!    Both Mathew and Shannon gave you great advice as well.    ss|`|dd89c26fc0bd65517a42ae6029f3e27eaa	I would suggest starting out at a community college.

PipBgjHGaa	If you are speaking of improving how you write in regards to penmanship and how neat you write I can't help you. But if you a re speaking abiut writting papers and such then I do have some advice. You said you have issues with grammar, I think that you should read more. This is a sure way to expand your vocabulary. Reading will also allow you to see how proper punctuations are used and then how to incorporate them in to how you write correctly. Just read more and it will imporve.|`|kGTvJS4paa	Using an expanded vocabulary will help your writing. Also look into rhetorical devices, they are really easy to use and help you describe and give detail to what you are saying, which will keep the readers attention, and show that you have experience with the topic you are writing about.     Hope that helps!|`|jpU9x3rBaa	you should try to read more books that are little bit harder for you to read so you can learn more words , syntax, grammar      also ask your teacher for more help

uSHPmfYoaa	The y-intercept is the point where the x value is equal to 0, so the y-intercept would lie on the y-axis.    The equation for a slope is fairly simple. Take two points (for example, (3,2) and (9,4)  You would take the second y value (4) and subtract the first y value (2) from it. You would then do the same thing with the x values.    4-2=2  --------  9-3=6    You would then simplify the fraction, and you would get a slope of 1/3.

3AgA3WNUaa	The best way to cite sources in a research paper is using parenthetical citations.    To use these, right down the information in your essay that you wish to use. After, leave out the punctuation and add a parenthesis. Include the author of the source's last name or the book source title, then the page number. Follow it up with a period and underline the source title if it is a book title. EXAMPLE: (Smith 112). or (The Research Paper Handbook 21).    Be sure to also include the source in your Works Cited page!|`|AA11222724	What you need to do is put a small number next to the end of each quote, and at the end of the page at the bottom list the numbers and the author and page number where the original quote appears, and the title of the book you quoted from. You can use ibid if you are using two quotes from the one book rather than having to list the title, author etc twice. Then in your bibliography at the end of the essay list all quotes in chronological order, with number, title, author, page and date of publishing and the publisher.|`|9Jddf0nyaa	Book      Okuda, Michael, and Denise Okuda.

1oCKvoSvaa	If you're based in the US, and you're planning to study something related to communications, and you have prior experience in P.R., then you could do practically anything in the communications field; from advertising/PR strategy, to account management, to consumer research; really there's no limit to what you could do. <br>  <br>  What I'd suggest is find where your passion lies, and pursue it. No one knows better than you what you ought to do. If you find you've taken a wrong turn somewhere, you could always pick up and move on. I studied Information Technology in my undergrad (HUGE mistake), then worked at an ad agency for 4 years before I came to the US for my MA in Advertising. I'm doing what I enjoy, and aside from the slight undergrad hiccup, I have no regrets.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

is0cZxlLaa	I'm 26 and I am just figuring out what I want to do. Don't let the society tell you that you have to go right to college after high school. Do what you think is right and what interests you. You need to think outside th box a little bit. You don't have to be a lawyer, accountant, or a teacher in order to be happy. Take some time and figure out what it is that you want. That is what will make you happy. And at 14 years old, what you want now won't be the same as when you are 18 and 20. I can guarantee that! Be responsible, but do what you want and you will live a better life. Quit worry about what you want to be when you grow up. If you decide now,  you'll only change your mind later. Get some life experience and then decide!

Also attending college generally there are other fees that you will also have to pay.  Parking, student life fee, accidental fee, lab and technology fee etc.  Each school has different requirement and fees.  When figuring out the amount that you might have to pay for school, you also have to include all those fees too.

The thing that ends up happening is that you have a paragraph with one or two really great sentences and the rest is  full of crap that you write trying to get to five sentences. Pick up any book and you'll find that they don't use 5-7 sentences in their paragraphs. I think it all depends on what you're writing.

AA12265335	The easy answer is: No.    The more developed answer is: they can be.  If you want to get your degree online, your best bet is to find out what traditional, accredited colleges in your area have online degree programs.  Find out whether your degree will be stamped, "online program," or not since employers are (rightly so) suspicious of anyone getting a degree online.  There are many diploma mills such as the University of Phoenix, which are not, in fact, quality educational institutions.    If you're looking to save money, going to school online usually costs MORE money than going to a traditional school, so I'd recommend comparing costs carefully.    In Wisconsin, we have programs via the University of Wisconsin system, and the University of Platteville, for example, has a complete online degree program that is offered in either online or correspondence course-based format (the latter does not require as strict of a timeline since you are not "in class" with students online).  It does not stamp your degree as being "online."  The University of Wisconsin also offers a two-year degree program online, but it is stamped as "online."  If you think you want to get your general studies courses out of the way and will do your last 2-3 years at a traditional university, this degree being stamped "online" may not matter much.    Check with your state or the surrounding states and see what options you might have.  Many of the traditional universities and even many private colleges (which have been accredited forever and are constantly undergoing review) will offer you an online program (or online courses to supplement a traditional program) and they will be a legitimate degree that is not a "diploma mill."    Compare your costs.  Find out how much it costs to do the program in different kinds of schools.  Community colleges, if you have any where you live, are often a great way to get the "general studies" courses out of the way at a smaller, more supportive environment, and many tech schools now offer an associates degree program that transfers to a traditional college (with those general studies courses out of the way).  Tech colleges are often cheaper, too!  You might find an online program is cheaper, or you might be better off in traditional face-to-face classes (we're used to learning that way and many cannot learn effectively in an online format).    Figure out first what you think you want to study, then do the work of comparing programs (luckily almost everything is online now).  Most schools will offer you financial aid as a full-time student, whether or not the school is online, but your safest bet is to make sure your online program is backed by a traditional university that has real buildings and real professors (not all part-time teachers).    Good luck!|`|AA11166215	No its best to go to a 4 year college

No formal territorial claims were made until 1770, when Capt. James COOK took possession in the name of Great Britain. Six colonies were created in the late 18th and 19th centuries; they federated and became the Commonwealth of Australia in 1901. The new country took advantage of its natural resources to rapidly develop agricultural and manufacturing industries and to make a major contribution to the British effort in World Wars I and II. In recent decades, Australia has transformed itself into an internationally competitive, advanced market economy. It boasted one of the OECD's fastest growing economies during the 1990s, a performance due in large part to economic reforms adopted in the 1980s.

AA11124874	1. Yes.  2. Regardless of a child's family background, finding and building that child's full potential will create more fully productive adults, and will find more of those "diamonds in the rough." Equal funding creates better chances for those from poverty areas to access the instruction and materials they need to gain the skills to become part of the productive work force.  3. Absolutely it affects education. Lowered funding means increased class sizes and less materials to work with. The top two in-classroom variables for student success are student to teacher ratios (lower being better), and an intelligent and well-trained teacher. (The top overall variable being student economic class background).  4. Statewide tests are a joke. They are in place for two reasons... the first being that they are a money-making industry with strong lobbyists, and the second being that the Bush administration wants to scapegoat teachers rather than being straightforward about wanting to cut Education out of the Federal budget (it isn't a Constitutionally defined federal area, anyway).     True accountability can be easily implemented through the following steps:  1. students pass at 80% (B-average), not 60% (D-average), and passing to the next grade must be documented and justified, rather than having to justify retention (students being retained more than once in their school careers should be placed with additional supports, such as remedial classes with even smaller teacher-student ratios, and/or special education supports)  2. student achievement documented through portfolios demonstrating pre- and post-instruction work and tests, addressing the state standards and benchmarks. The tests can be the unit tests the teachers are using anyway already.  3. Accountability for attendance (excepting severe health issues...requiring special education and homebound instruction) and behavior (excepting Emotional disorders requiring special education and possible alternative placements) should be held entirely by the parents, not the schools. Right now, schools are held entirely accountable for both, and can lose AYP for these issues.  4. All the funding and staffing by states currently used for state testing, should be placed into independent auditors of student portfolios on a random sampling basis.  5. If the Bush administration wants to end Federal funding for Education, bite the bullet and have the courage to say so, with a plan to ease Federal control back to total state control over a 5 year period, with a direct transfer of federal income taxation to state income taxation percentages to cover the change. Federal taxation can be graually increased again, anyway.    Sorry, that's to logical and simple.

13ad5cb7f08f6b6e6b30bbeb739cdd83aa	The Circulation of Blood    The human circulatory system is really a two-part system whose purpose is to bring oxygen-bearing blood to all the tissues of the body. When the heart contracts it pushes the blood out into two major loops or cycles. In the systemic loop, the blood circulates into the bodys systems, bringing oxygen to all its organs, structures and tissues and collecting carbon dioxide waste. In the pulmonary loop, the blood circulates to and from the lungs, to release the carbon dioxide and pick up new oxygen. The systemic cycle is controlled by the left side of the heart, the pulmonary cycle by the right side of the heart. Lets look at what happens during each cycle:    The systemic loop begins when the oxygen-rich blood coming from the lungs enters the upper left chamber of the heart, the left atrium. As the chamber fills, it presses open the mitral valve and the blood flows down into the left ventricle. When the ventricles contract during a heartbeat, the blood on the left side is forced into the aorta. This largest artery of the body is an inch wide. The blood leaving the aorta brings oxygen to all the bodys cells through the network of ever smaller arteries and capillaries. The used blood from the body returns to the heart through the network of veins. All of the blood from the body is eventually collected into the two largest veins: the superior vena cava, which receives blood from the upper body, and the inferior vena cava, which receives blood from the lower body region. Both venae cavae empty the blood into the right atrium of the heart.    From here the blood begins its journey through the pulmonary cycle. From the right atrium the blood descends into the right ventricle through the tricuspid valve. When the ventricle contracts, the blood is pushed into the pulmonary artery that branches into two main parts: one going to the left lung, one to the right lung. The fresh, oxygen-rich blood returns to the left atrium of the heart through the pulmonary veins.    Although the circulatory system is made up of two cycles, both happen at the same time. The contraction of the heart muscle starts in the two atria, which push the blood into the ventricles. Then the walls of the ventricles squeeze together and force the blood out into the arteries: the aorta to the body and the pulmonary artery to the lungs. Afterwards, the heart muscle relaxes, allowing blood to flow in from the veins and fill the atria again. In healthy people the normal (resting) heart rate is about 72 beats per minute, but it can go much higher during strenuous exercise. Scientists have estimated that it takes about 30 seconds for a given portion of the blood to complete the entire cycle: from lungs to heart to body, back to the heart and out to the lungs.    ^_^|`|AA11545990	There are blood vessels to carry the blood to all parts of body from the heart , .

The point of this is basically for the gen. ed. courses, so that if you haven't decided exactly what you want to do yet, you can still go to college and decide there.

AA12121778	An artificial fiber is a threadlike material invented by human researchers. Such fibers do not exist naturally. Some examples of artificial fibers include nylon, rayon, Dacron and Orlon These terms illustrate that some names of artificial fibers are, or have become, common chemical names (nylon and rayon), while others (Dacron  and Orlon ) are proprietary names. Proprietary names are names that are owned by some company and are properly written to indicate that the name is a registered trademark      Most artificial fibers are polymers. A polymer is a chemical substance that is produced when one or two small molecules are reacted with each other over and over again. The beginning molecule used in making a polymer is called a monomer. When two different monomers are used, the product that results is called a copolymer.
AA11124220	In mathematics, Fibonacci coding is a universal code which encodes positive integers into binary code words. All tokens end with "11" and have no "11" before the end. The code begins as follows:    1  11  2  011  3  0011  4  1011  5  00011  6  10011  7  01011  8  000011  9  100011  10 010011  11 001011  12 101011    The Fibonacci code is closely related to Fibonacci representation, a positional numeral system sometimes used by mathematicians. The Fibonacci code for a particular integer is exactly that of the integer's Fibonacci representation, except with the order of its digits reversed and an additional "1" appended to the end.    To encode an integer X:       1. Find the largest Fibonacci number equal to or less than X; subtract this number from X, keeping track of the remainder.     2. If the number we subtracted was the Nth unique Fibonacci number, put a one in the Nth digit of our output.     3. Repeat the previous steps, substituting our remainder for X, until we reach a remainder of 0.     4. Place a one after the last naturally-occurring one in our output.    To decode a token in the code, remove the last "1", assign the remaining bits the values 1,2,3,5,8,13... (the Fibonacci numbers), and add the "1" bits.|`|AA11938888	the fibonacci code was to get Sophie's attention and to get Fache to call in a cryptologist  It's a simple code.  1+1=2 1+2=3 2+3=5 3+5=8 8+5=13  ... hence the code is 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 but it the book it was an anigram...13 3 21 1 1 8 5  this then was applied to the words O Draconian Devil and Oh lame saint to produce...Lenardo Di Vinci  The Mona Lisa|`|854aa14dc9148da9cf72b1be40e42dccaa	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerology|`|9b4eb076c7abed85584df4a021df8cf6aa	ok, your question isnt very clear, but i will try to answer the question as best as i can.  the fibonacci number sequence was one of the two keys that unlocked the cryptograph sophie's grandfather left her.  but anyway, the fibonacci sequence has nothing to do with the cryptograph except for the fact that is was one of the two keys to the cryptograph.

AA11124874	It isn't a surprise to me at all. I am a special education teacher... with a speciality in Learning Disabilities.    I would suggest that you have the school screen him for Phonemic Awareness issues through the Speech-Language Pathologist.  He may have an overall auditory processing disorder. This would interfere with his learning of spelling, but not his overall comprehension of materials.    A student with auditory processing difficulties, who is also very intelligent, learns to compensate for most of the interference from the disorder, but spelling is just too precise and complex, without a professional helping him.    If the testing does identify him as having a Language Disorder-Auditory Processing Disorder, he will need to see the Speech-Language Therapist, and should take only spelling (other subjects should continue in his regular classes) through a Special Education teacher trained in the instruction of advanced phonetic rules (such as the 3 sounds of "s" -- sun, is, sure; the 5 expectations for double vowels -- bead, bread, great, country, oil; etc, etc, etc.). For example, the Orton-Gillingham method.    Also, think about his apparent attentiveness, etc. There are additional symptoms listed on these links, which in him would appear VERY mild, because with his smarts he's masking them well.    http://www.ldonline.org/articles/8056    http://ericec.org/digests/e634.html    http://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/voice/au...

Get him tested as soon as possible... the sooner you get him help, the sooner he can complete programming and "exit" from special supports... I have an APD student who may be exited this year... if he maintains his age-level spelling skills over the summer, that he finally achieved by last April, after 2 years in program.

Good luck!|`|59231d6122d11016c021df011e4f4050aa	I couldn't tell you what expert to take your child to, but I can tell you that my family faced a similar situation with me.  I read far above my grade level, was excellent at math, science, and basically anything else, but could not spell.  My answer would be to just give it time.  Be gentle on your kiddo if the spelling tests come back with low grades, praise for the high grades in other subjects, and eventually the spelling will come around.  I was in college before I noticed that I could start spelling anything correctly, and I'm entering med school now.  It was frustrating at the time, but not something that was detrimental.  Just be patient, and it will fix itself.    If you want to work on the spelling, try to make it fun...and covert.  *smile*  Write stories with your child.  Look up fun words in the dictionary.  Make up silly songs to spell words out.  Try clapping out syllables.  Start spelling out the spelling words at the dinner table between conversation "I was s-u-p-r-i-s-e-d when your teacher called with the great news today."      I wish you both luck!

Now if you will recall that when the Avada Kedavra spell was cast in previous books, the victim falls to the ground, already dead.  Now why would this time be different???

Whereas, the term "simplify" generally refers to improper fractions (the numerator is larger than the denominator).    When reducing a proper fraction, follow these steps:       Factor the numerator.       Factor the denominator.        Cancel-out  fraction mixes that have a value of 1.       Re-write your answer as the reduced fraction.    Example:        To reduce 24/56 we factor the Numerator (24 = 2 x 2 x 2 x 3) and then factor the Denominator (56 = 2 x 2 x 2 x 7).            In this example all of the 2s are eliminated because there are an equal number of 2s in both the numerator and denominator. They cancel-out one-for-one. That's what we mean by a fraction mix that has the value of "1".     The correct answer for the example above is a reduced fraction that's equal to 3/7.     Here's another way to look at reducing 24/56.     You already know that 2/2 = 1, so...        is the same as  which is equal to 1 x 1 x 1 x 3/7     Therefore, you would re-write your answer as 24/56 is equal (or equivalent) to 3/7.     That's the basics of reducing proper fractions, regardless of size.     Best Regards,     Yoshimccaru|`|W2UxTLjsaa	412/1000 =   206/500 =  103/250 = Your answer!

rfwbZ2AXaa	I can tell you about my college experiences.    You are on your own.  You are responsible for your own learning.  Teachers come in, they lecture, they leave.  You have to read the chapters on your own, do the questions on your own and then you have maybe 4 tests in a semseter.    Two are the mid term and final.  Some teachers require journals or notebooks to be turned in. and then there are the research papers.  If you have a class that meets once a week then you would read about 5 chapters from one class meeting to the next  Twice a week about 2 or 3 between meetings  Three times a week maybe a chapter between each class.  So your teacher is not far off the mark.  College can be hard for kids who do not know how to budget their time and plan for all the reading and independent work.  For kids who have always done their homework and kept up with reading then they are fine.  You are better off getting into the habit before you go.

You might have one or two classes four days a week and the fifth day off.     And, no, you usually won't have 50 pages per class.|`|b47fe4a0b1c7337ece7bbbffa4c65d6baa	Your teacher may have had good intentions but college is not as difficult as they're trying to make it seem. Several, if not most, colleges provide freshman with an introduction to college course. That course teaches good study habits and time mangement skills. You will still take multiple choice tests in college. Your academic advisor will set you up with the best schedule for you after accessing your abilities. Hope this was helpful. College is challenging but also a lot of fun|`|1yGDFTieaa	No, that's not true.    Even in university you don't write a paper with 50 pages, well, you could if you enlarged the font!

ahjqc9Ifaa	lol nailed it. My first impression was the verb tense issue. Then I noticed over-description of clothing (dates it, and who cares?) and a tendency to over-choreograph, telling us every move and expression.    Remember when you rewrite that one character's actions should not be in the same paragraph as the other character's words, so you need a lot of paragraph breaks. Example (all one paragraph in the original):    Something wrong? Cuz, man, Im an AWESOME tour guide. Not to mention totally sexy. He flashed another smile.     I couldnt help but chuckle a bit, shaking my head.     His smiled widened, and his hand caught my elbow. He pulled a bit towards a different direction then I was heading. Cmon, Ill show you lunchroom first. Theres these awesome coffee machines with like six different flavors. He tugged again.     I bit my bottom lip, unsure.     He paused again, smiling, and let go of me to cross his arm. If you dont come, whose gonna show you the good flavors from the crappy ones? Admit it, man, you need me.     I return his smile, raising my eyebrows. He raises his as well, challenging me.    Far clearer, and more the way most publishers want to see it done.    I've got no problem with gay fiction, but I'm not feeling the sexual tension that the flirtation ought to be a cover for. That's because I am not inside your POV (point of view) character's thoughts. I observe only what anyone else could--his movements, expressions, and what he says. Share his thoughts and emotions, fears, etc. and the work will be much improved.    FWIW, I truly believe that the writer should fix his work as much as he is able (grammar issues like the verb tense, spell check, etc.) before showing it around. I wouldn't consider serious critique of more than a page of work that hadn't been polished from rough first draft condition, because I'd be noting and correcting things the author could do without my help.|`|FZKFLTyLaa	The most noticeable thing is several shifts between present and past tense verbs,

He was a light chocolate color, and his eyes were storm blue, almost gray, barely visible beneath a black beanie.    He stood about an inch shorter than me, but made up for it in the width of his shoulders. His dark hoodie hugged his toned forearms and torso.    I absolutely love the way you describe the color of the eyes as being "storm blue", definitely keep that part. Good luck!|`|QGyasdZMaa	do you like "He stood an inch shorter but broader by the same amount" ?  Indicentally, shorter than whom?    I prefer the second description, it seems to flow more smoothly, you would read that kind of prose in published fiction.    I would add that the first (to me) sounds as though it was written by a male and the second by a female writer.  Couldn't tell you why, it's just the impression it gives me!    Hope this helps.|`|1nTMR3W0aa	in my opinion the second paragraph is better it has enough detail then gets to the point, but in the first it was to detailed. both are very good but the second to me is better.    when you say, "He stood no more than an inch shorter, but was an inch wider at the shoulders,"  i think its fine but if you like you could say, "He was shorter than me but his soulders were wide. but i like what you wrote better|`|9eff1b5aa4622a55c29265ea61c44c5caa	i vote   2nd|`|oDIIca9xaa	personally i like the second better. i don't think the sentence is too bad. its pretty good at describing him. i think i would say it  "I was suprised to see him so close to my level; he stood no more than an inch shorter than I.  But the hight differance was canceled out by the extra inch added to the width of his shoulders."    that's just a rough draft sentence. your welcome to it if you'd like. hope i was helpful...

gK9GC1mMaa	I can answer each of those.     However, you didn't ask us to give you the answers. Nor did you say "please". Where are your manners?    Honestly, use your brain, but, if you find yourself unable to use that particular part of your brain that has the answers, then look at your notes!  Worn footpaths? What could anyone POSSIBLY do? Perhaps create new ones? Maybe they should just cut off the footpath altogether!? Good God, Sheila, it isn't rocket science. They create stone pathways.     Overcrowding? Well good gosh, if someone hasn't invited the whole town to one place! Make it bigger, offer more amenities in a different area!     Use your brain, Amelia, and look at your notes. If all else fails, go to your teacher at a lunch time or before registration and see if they can't just pull the wool from over your eyes and show you a page-full of notes!
lP9XaRMNaa	Well I'm sure it's alot easier, pleasent than being a secondary school teacher!|`|09YWnp8paa	It's simply the best job in the world! I went into teaching late, and I've never regretted it, not for one minute! It's an awesome responsibility, but you forge great relationships with the children in your care. They depend upon you, trust you, even love you! There is simply nothing more rewarding. Of course there are down sides. Rarely from the children though! Adults are the hardest thing about teaching, and not just the parents! If you're from the UK, there has been a marked increase in the amount of meetings and paperwork that you have to do, despite what the government has tried to do. with every piece of red tape that has been removed, three have been put in its place! BUT, if you can work out some form of routine, it's not so bad. Well, it IS, but the most important thing is having a great time with your class! And you can. Planning lessons, marking, it's all part and parcel of the job, so is meeting parents, but building up a community is just so rewarding that everything else fades into insignificance. The only thing to really watch out for is the lack of time. Time simply disappears in teaching. Before you know it, as you wander into school on Monday morning, it's suddenly Friday evening! Where do the weeks go? It's frightening. I hope you make a go of it. You'll never regret it.|`|bdd5906c6ef8d8517a055d4bcfd6d075aa	I think it's a good profession. I love teaching and the younger grades are my favorite. As far as if it's bad, I say the economy is in a bad place right now and a lot of schools have to cut back on their budgets, so they may not be hiring.     As far as what you have to do, it depends on what school you're working for and how much effort you put into your classroom. But, in the summer you could be setting up your classroom and decorating it for your upcoming students. You could get a class pet and that's a whole other responsibility. You have lesson planning to do and paperwork for IEPs.  You'll have to meet with parents on planned and sometimes not planned basis for good and bad things. You'll have to keep in contact with parents, which sometimes can be hard. Getting the parents involved in the classroom is a good idea.  You'll have to grade papers and do assessments.  Just making learning fun is one of my biggest goal. There's a lot more to being a teacher than just teaching. Hopefully you make the best decision for you!|`|W2aO4kC0aa	well it mostly depends on the school you choose. and mostly how the kids behave.|`|WWknr7Ayaa	Well done on thinking of becoming a primary school teacher - it's a great profession.    I like primary teaching because you get to spend all day with your class instead of skipping from one class to another ias n secondary.  This means you build really valuable relationships with the children and their parents.  The downside if there is one is that you need to be able to teach confidentltly everthing from music to history and PE to science.  So you need a really good general knowledge.
3VLvEeRUaa	Question 23:  The earth is divided into four main layers: the inner core, outer core, mantle, and crust. The core is composed mostly of iron (Fe) and is so hot that the outer core is molten, with about 10% sulphur (S). The inner core is under such extreme pressure that it remains solid. Most of the Earth's mass is in the mantle, which is composed of iron (Fe), magnesium (Mg), aluminum (Al), silicon (Si), and oxygen (O) silicate compounds. At over 1000 degrees C, the mantle is solid but can deform slowly in a plastic manner. The crust is much thinner than any of the other layers, and is composed of the least dense calcium (Ca) and sodium (Na) aluminum-silicate minerals. Being relatively cold, the crust is rocky and brittle, so it can fracture in earthquakes.     How was the Earth's core discovered? Recordings of seismic waves from earthquakes gave the first clue. Seismic waves will bend and reflect at the interfaces between different materials.    For more information, visit:  http://www.seismo.unr.edu/ftp/pub/louie/...    Question 24:  In the 1900's, a German meteorologist by the name of Alfred Wegener was the first to present  an argument supporting continental drift. He proposed that the continents were not stationary, but actually moving or drifting away from one another.  His primary sources of evidence included the fit of the continents, glacial till deposits, and the apparent shifting of climatic belts over time.  His colleagues at the time argued for polar wandering as an explanation of his data. These ideas were not well accepted until later scientists in the 1940's and 50's expanded on these ideas adding to them paleomagnetism, convection currents and sea floor spreading.  With all this new evidence, plate tectonic theory became an accepted idea in the 1970's.     Later evidence was given in support of Wegener's ideas.  One source of evidence was that of paleomagnetism.  When hot magma rises to the earth's surface and cools, the minerals themselves (especially magnetite) become magnetized in alignment with the Earth's magnetic field.    Rocks that were formed at different places on the Earth's surface have different magnetizations.  Using this information, when rock layers were uncovered with a magnetization that did not agree with it's position on the Earth, questions were raised.  It was proposed that the Earth's magnetic poles wandered.     Paleomagnetic data was collected from North America and Europe.  Using the alignment of magnetite minerals in the rock layers, the movement of the magnetic poles could be traced through the different geologic periods.

SLFt8eHEaa	The link below will show you the requirements for getting on the veterinary medicine course, including which A levels you'll need:    http://www.cam.ac.uk/admissions/undergra...    One thing it doesn't really deal with properly is the grades you'll need.  Whilst the website says you can get A-Cs at GCSE, in reality almost everyone who goes to Cambridge will have a mixture of A*s and As at GCSE and so in order to match up to the competition those are the sort of grades you will need.  Likewise, for your A levels you will need straight A*s in the required subjects.    The only other thing I'd say is that when selecting applicants, the tutors at Cambridge like to see someone who has a real passion for their course and who has knowledge of it in excess of that of the average student.  I'd therefore recommend that do you things such as try and get some work experience at a local vets and try and follow the latest veterinary journals.

e7663cf7226c2b25f5a64eeea04103cfaa	From wiki answers:    Doctor of Philosophy as in Doctor of the Philosophy of Art.     The reason for the name is historical. Most universities used to have only four majors: divinity, law, medicine, and philosophy. All other modern subjects (such as physics, English, math) were part of philosophy, and so most subjects still use PhD as their doctoral degree.         Basically its not just doctorate of philosphy, but philosophy of arts and you can specify an art.|`|lQIKWXDuaa	Philosophy is the study of general problems concerning matters such as existence, knowledge, truth, beauty, justice, validity, mind, and language. What do philosophers do? They question and study the world around them.  They posed question like is the world flat or round?  Does the earth evolve around the sun etc...? Is there a man on the moon?  Think about the great thinkers in ancient time what did they? Socrates was not the only philosopher. Philosopher in those days questioned everything from Art, science, the mind, life after death you name it.    Someone with a philosophy degree are trained to address problems in their field. They are the philosopher in whatever field they have studied. They are the problem solvers.       ss|`|GeIwAUvNaa	Why is a Bachelor of Arts degree given to students who are married?|`|iSMWMhHraa	You can get a PhD in many different areas. To obtain it in my field, as in many others, you have to do research and be published in a certain type of journal. You usually have to write a thesis that describes the research that you completed. Because you are studying and functioning at such a higher level, it could be said that you are a philosopher in your field.

fhET9Awpaa	I'd recommend drawing something they were famous for, so if Raphael was an artist, then try to draw one of his pieces of art. For Vasco dagama you could draw a ship to represent his explorations. Just google their names and find a piece of art or something they are famous for, then decide what symbol could be a metaphor for them. If someone is a strong Protestant or Catholic, you could draw a cross or a church.     Good luck.

Well, I don't know if this is allowed or not but maybe you could write your own poem. That way it would show your creative and that you can think outside the box. You'll know what emotions to express and when a lot better too. Just write what you feel and make sure that it has a steady rhythm and one sentence flows into the other. Write about something your passionate about. Something that you can express almost naturally. That would probably blow them away.      If your not the creative type, then look up a poem about something you feel strongly about. Make sure it suits you and that its not just some random poem you picked out. It wouldn't be as good if you didn't believe in what you were saying. I wouldn't even try a haiku. That might give off the impression that your lazy.      Don't overact, unless its a drama(the play). Then by all means, overact. Project your voice and enunciate, make sure to keep eye contact. If you decide to walk around while your reading it, DON'T EVER PUT YOUR BACK TO THE AUDIENCE!!!     It might be hard to do, but relax. Memorize the poem for the most part so the words come more naturally. Bring index cards with the poem written on it just incase you forget some of it!     I hope that helped!!!

b130d64eacb57af7bbee0fda7b233748aa	 mmm...to teach within a culture as a regemented profesional is a tremendus chalange, I have no doubt.    A white woman tought my 2nd, 3rd, @ 4th grade, and i have no doubt her years with my school were no easy thing for her to do back then.  Reservation life in the 50's was nothing to envy.    I'm in my 60's now, and she walks in my memories as enthewsiastic and vibrant today as she did the day she took my boots from me to diswade me from hikeing home at noon resess every day.    last winter you met another 'challenge', and you found 'teaching' was by far superior to the inconvienance, and the irritations of rebellion and rudness and interferance.    You obviously love doing what you do..  and perhaps you do DO it well, and as a 'teacher' you have accrued investments in your students, and there lives, and obviously the parifry of your tenure there is complicated...    ..the grass isnt always greener on the other side of the fence, dear... and much of what is so irritateing will be elswhere as well.  Play the games of culture and socal pryotitys, but play them with the heart of a teacher, and let silly-ness of reform be someone elses theater.    Teach your charges the arts of acceptance, patience, endurance, passion for life and rightness, and loyalty to familys, friends, nationality, country, creed, faith, and humanity.     Theach them the best of all you hold priceless and inalienable.. teach them to be brave and coragous and truthfull to one another, and above all, truthfull to themselves.    ..  i know..  i shulda payed attention in spelling classes....  but the truth is, that was the last class of the day, and i was not the most attentive student  back then...    besides, my spell checker just played hoolie...

lQIKWXDuaa	Well then you have to ask your self what is the reasoning behind their hatred. That is the real question. You have to research what do they hope to gain? What are they demanding? For example, in the middle east, the bombing of Israel by Hamas is because he wants the Israel to return the land that he says belong to Palestine. SO you have to research how did this land becomes Israel and such. Please note I do not endorse any hatred or violent act but I strongly believe that sometimes there is a reason behind it, whether it is good or evil. I hope that this gave you a start for your paper. As far as America is concern, I am not sure why they brought that 9/11 to the US. I wonder if it is because we side with countries like Israel. I know that they bomb the US embassy that is in some Islamic country. My guess would be it is because they hate foreign occupancy of their home but I dont know. I can also tell you that smart intelligent people uses the idea of religious war to brain wash the youth in their home land to get them to do foolish act. My question is how can someone who has a wife and kid become a suicide bomber. The whole idea behind having a family is to watch it grow. So these are some issue you can address in your paper.   Also, I remember that once Bush declared war on terror after 911,  most of the American allies suffered from terrorist activities like England and France. One country in South America there was a really horrible train accident that killed hundreds.  I dont recall the name of that country. Go to a good library and ask a librarian to help guide you to books written on this subject matter. Good luck.    ss|`|FGmEoXw9aa	Well..in a way, you really cant find out by reading books.

You know how some people are when someone visits somewhere foreign. And you get a rude person saying, Well you're not from these parts, huh, well git her up, good luck, its a wide world out there, HAHAHAH. Now go on, scooott, Hahahahah.

N9VN9bwfaa	With a little help from Webster's NewWorld Dictionary (which isn't that new anymore but still pretty good, dating to 1982), "advice" is an opinion given as to what to do or how to handle a situation.  It can also be counsel, information, or a report.    "Suggestion" has more meanings.  It's the process by which an idea is brought to the mind through its connection or association with an idea that's already in the mind -- so music can suggest an emotion, or a memory, a picture of ice cream on TV can suggest hunger, and so on.  It's also a faint hint or indication, a small amount or trace, as in the phrase, "a suggestion of boredom in her tone."  In psychology, it's the inducing of an idea that is accepted or acted upon readily and uncritically, as for example, when somebody is under hypnosis.  I saw this happen at a party once, when one fellow hypnotysed several guests and "suggested" that their index finger was magic and they walked around with that finger out, as if in a daze, acting very silly and as if they were afraid to touch anything.  He tried to hypnotise me too but I guess I was too thick-skulled and it didn't work.      There's also the meaning that Webster doesn't bother to mention, the one I imagine you're thinking of, which almost the same as advice.  You can give someone a suggestion about how to go about doing something.  That's the most common use of the word in conversation, so it's surprising that Webster doesn't talk about it, but there's no accounting for dictionary-makers.  When I use suggestion, I usually mean minor bits of advice, like how to do homework or sew a blouse, or get rid of weeds in the lawn, or train the dog to sit, and when I give advice it's much grander than that.  I think of advice as the stuff that they really ought to pay attention to because maybe their lives will depend on it -- stuff like whether or not to get a divorce or whether to fly to Brazil in the middle of a snowstorm (NO! NO! ARE YOU INSANE?  The PLANE will CRASH!  GET BACK IN HERE THIS INSTANT!)  But nobody ever listens to me anyway, so I don't suppose that distinction is really all that important.|`|VTuFo8Aqaa	Advice is simply a proposal for a certain course of action while a suggestion is a proposal offered for acceptance or rejection (both definitions from google). That's the best I can do, for they are both very similar.

rfwbZ2AXaa	Teachers sign a moral contract when they are hired. They are NOT allowed to interact with students in an inappropriate manner.  Dating would be inappropriate.  If a student comes on to a teacher the teacher is not required to report it, but I would for my personal safety as a teacher.  Students have been know to make stuff up about teachers and get them fired.    I had a friend in high school who is now married to the english teacher he had as a 10th grader.  They got married about a year after graduation.  She told him that if he was still interested when he graduated to come see her, well he did.    Most teachers should not be interested in anyone who is their student in that way. If they are then they are not being very professional.    So the answers to your questions are:  No  Yes  Cannot take it    Good luck  Beth|`|EapVGOgYaa	If this only happen once I would just continue teaching as I always had. Should he  approach a second time I state very clearly that you do not approve of his actions, ask him to stop... or you'll have no choice but to report it the proper authorities.  If it was clearly a one time thing you should be OK.  As you no doubt know young people are ripe for gossip and there's no telling what may transpire after you have "rejected" this person.    I would also keep a little record of times and places and what said.  Reporting it can be to your advantage be cause there is a strategy referred to as "cover your but."   Produce a per trail with your superior to protect yourself in the future. It is unfortunate in this day and age that public employees, but teachers especially must be aware and protective.  It may be a good idea to always have someone with you while in school and walking in and out.  May sound extreme but an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.  Any accusations made against you could ruin  your career even if 100% false.

You could combine math with finance/economics/business courses, some universities offer majors in mathematical finance. Just because you have some finance or business background doesn't mean you have to work on Wall Street, often companies in any industry like people with a bit of business background. Maybe look into actuarial science (supposedly big bucks but you might have to sell your soul to insurance companies), statistics, operations research... you could also do accounting but that's really number crunching not math.     Also maybe consider computer science. Computer science involves a lot of math and it's a different, some would say more creative type of math than engineers' math. I'm a computer science major and I actually like math more than computers. Sure I had to tolerate my operating systems course which I hated, but many areas like artificial intelligence, graphics, cryptography, etc. are largely about using mathematical algorithms.|`|IGSVfbGuaa	Biology.
mzgEgG57aa	First get Y by itself on the bottom equation, so it's y=13+2x  then just plug that in for the other equation.  so..  6x+3(13+2x)=-21  then solve for x  6x+39+6x=-21 (distributive)  12x+39=-21 (added the x's together)  12x=-60 (subtracted 39 form both sides)  x=-5 (divided by 12)  then, put that number into the -2x+y=13  so  -2(-5)+y=13  10+y=13 (multiplied)  y=3 (subtracted 10 from both sides)    so your answers would be x=-5 and y=3    hope that helped! :)|`|VgX9o60Uaa	Ok i just explained this to someone else. You need to get rid of one variable. so lets make the ys equal to eachother. To do that we need to multiply the second equation by 3 for y to equal 3. So now our equations are 6x 3y -21 and -6x 3y 39. ok now lets get rid of y. We will subract the second problem from the first. So 6x minus -6x is 12x, 3y - 3y is 0, and -21 - 39 is -60. ok so now we have 12x equals negative 60. So -60 divided by 12 is -5. So x is negative 5. Now we plug in -5 for x into either equation to solve for y. So 6 times -5 is -30 so our new equations is -30 + 3y equals negative 21. So negative 21 plus 30 is 9. So now 9 equals 3y. or y equals 3 so y is 3 x is negative 5|`|Yg0KNQzNaa	the answer is 4x + 4y = -8
rTLmZzjnaa	Well you can use trial and error to get close to the answer    Let's start with 6 checks:-    Anywhere plan: 6 x 15 cents each = 90 cents  AccuCheck plan: 6 x 6 cents each = 36 cents + 1.53 = 1.89    So the AccuCheck plan is almost double the cost than the Anywhere plan. So let's go a lot higher and try 16 checks:-    Anywhere plan: 16 x 15 cents each = 2.40  AccuCheck plan: 16 x 6 cents each = 96 + 1.53 = 2.49    Now the AccuCheck plan is closer, but still just slightly more expensive. We know that each check on the Anywhere plan adds 15 cents, and each check on the AccuCheck plan adds 6 cents, so we can simply use the last calculation to add incremental checks:-    Anywhere plan x 17 checks: 2.40 + 0.15 = 2.55  AccuCheck plan x 17 checks: 2.49 + 0.06 = 2.55    They've both reached the same price now. Thus we can conclude that any further checks would make the AccuCheck plan cheaper than the Anywhere plan. Meaning the answer is that you'll need to pay in at least 18 checks per month for the AccuCheck plan to be cheaper than the Anywhere plan.

The reason why there are criminals is that the criminals have problems. It would be in the form of financial, psychological, and emotional problem. So, we have to be nice too them to test their conscience. I mean, we must give encouragement to them and we must inspire them and we must be a good example to them. So that, they will feel that life is good and understand that life should be good. Psychiatrist's and psychologist's help can do a lot.|`|AA11631401	Definitely not. There are various reasons for that; firstly, it seems to me that death penalty is a kind of vengeance against those who committed a serious crime. Secondly, the proponents of death penalty claim that it can act as a deterrent. But the meaning of punishment, in general, is the criminals' REFORMATION. No one will reform his/her character or behaviour when executed. It's better to replace death penalty with actual life imprisonment, excluding the possibility of parole. As far as I know, death penalty hasn't stopped people from conducting appalling crimes... Thirdly, absolutely no one can be sure about someone's guilt... A number of reasons can be pointed out about that; perjury, lack of evidence, inadequate legal representation and the juror's personal prejudices are some....On the whole, I think it should be abolished.

3973a07ff2ecc32e8b983f748edbca36aa	The proclamation made the end of slavery a key goal of the war (along with restoring the Union) and was highly controversial in the North. It was not a law passed by Congress but a presidential order empowered, Lincoln knew, by his position as "Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy" under Article II, section 2 of the United States Constitution. It first affected only those slaves that had already escaped to the Union side, but as the Union armies advanced, tens of thousands of slaves were liberated each day until nearly all (estimated at 4 million) were free by the summer of 1865. Some slavery continued to exist in the border states until the entire institution was finally wiped out by the ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment on December 6, 1865.|`|aeb191e55af6a15a39067a4bc8fe50d6aa	because he was against slavery ever since He was a lawyer in New Salem illinois which is right outside of Springfield Illinois.|`|AA10333764	The Emancipation Proclamation did not free the slaves, and it did not outlaw slavery.    In September of 1862, Lincoln issued a decree that all slaves in those states that are still in rebellion against the Union on January 1 1863 would be considered free. He outlined the definition of what it meant to be in rebellion. Then he gave the South 100 days to give up their fighting. If they did, they would be allowed to keep their slaves since the decree would not apply to them.    The Emancipation Proclamation was the decree that defined the sections of the country that were still in rebellion (most of them) and to which the earlier decree applied. A few small areas stopped fighting and kept their slaves.    This entire process, therefore, was an attempt to persuade the South to give up the war and keep their slaves in return.    The fact that the South did not is evidence that slavery was not their primary reason for going to war.   .       With the South breaking off, it was a threat to the very existance of the United States. England and France, not to mention Spain were all keenly interested in getting back part of the New World. Lincoln was far-sighted in this one. He saw this and only later declared slavery was the reason war was in progres. This made the Europeans look like any advance on their part would be part of a larger immoral issue.   1.

Another possibility is have students write letters to their friends, detailing what they think, feel, or see during this time period.

You might also consider have students writing short stories using the key elements found in the literature of this time period.

It outlines each and every assignment, and what is expected of you and how the instructor will grade you, IE: how much of each thing gets what type of score, and if any what can earn you extra credit.

J7VPM23Xaa	It's called Alzheimer's disease, and it gradually robs the person of memories.  It's not curable or reversible.|`|gUg300Mmaa	Alzheimers is a disease that older people can get.  It effect the brain creating holes or plaques, so the brain cells cannot communicate with each other.  It severely effects memory.  Short term memory goes first then newer memories, then older memories.  So she may forget you first then your parents then her husband.  this happens over time.  faster in some people.  www.alz.org/alzheimers_disease_what_is...|`|kOVp9F0oaa	Alzheimer's disease (AD), also called Alzheimer disease, Senile Dementia of the Alzheimer Type (SDAT) or simply Alzheimer's, is the most common form of dementia. This incurable, degenerative, and terminal disease was first described by German psychiatrist Alois Alzheimer in 1906. Generally it is diagnosed in people over 65 years of age, although the less-prevalent early-onset Alzheimer's can occur much earlier. An estimated 26.6 million people worldwide had Alzheimer's in 2006; this number may quadruple by 2050.    Although each sufferer experiences Alzheimer's in a unique way, there are many common symptoms. The earliest observable symptoms are often mistakenly thought to be 'age-related' concerns, or manifestations of stress. In the early stages, the most commonly recognised symptom is memory loss, such as difficulty in remembering recently learned facts. When a doctor or physician has been notified, and AD is suspected, the diagnosis is usually confirmed with behavioural assessments and cognitive tests, often followed by a brain scan if available. As the disease advances, symptoms include confusion, irritability and aggression, mood swings, language breakdown, long-term memory loss, and the general withdrawal of the sufferer as their senses decline.Gradually, bodily functions are lost, ultimately leading to death. Individual prognosis is difficult to assess, as the duration of the disease varies. AD develops for an indeterminate period of time before becoming fully apparent, and it can progress undiagnosed for years. The mean life expectancy following diagnosis is approximately seven years. Fewer than three percent of individuals live more than fourteen years after diagnosis.    The cause and progression of Alzheimer's disease are not well understood. Research indicates that the disease is associated with plaques and tangles in the brain. Currently-used treatments offer a small symptomatic benefit; no treatments to delay or halt the progression of the disease are as yet available. As of 2008, more than 500 clinical trials were investigating possible treatments for AD, but it is unknown if any of them will prove successful. Many measures have been suggested for the prevention of Alzheimer's disease, but their value is unproven in slowing the course and reducing the severity of the disease. Mental stimulation, exercise, and a balanced diet are often recommended, as both a possible prevention and a sensible way of managing the disease.    Because AD cannot be cured and is degenerative, management of patients is essential. The role of the main caregiver is often taken by the spouse or a close relative. Alzheimer's disease is known for placing a great burden on caregivers; the pressures can be wide-ranging, involving social, psychological, physical, and economic elements of the caregiver's life. In developed countries, AD is one of the most economically costly diseases to society.|`|B1NuRCMRaa	Im no expert but it seems to me like they go backwards in their memories. Like they forget the most recent stuff 1st. Eventually they seem like their living in their 30s, then the memories go to their 20s, then they remember teenager stuff or younger. Many platue in different times of their lives. I know one lady (83yrs old) that was living in her early thirties, she didnt remember her real children because they were adults but thought visiting kids around 6yrs old were hers. Another woman lived about 12yrs old, and she was very afraid of her mother, who was already dead many years but she thought she would be home any minute now.    Its really important that you dont ask her "do you remember me?" or "dontcha remember when.......?" because they dont and it makes them very frustrated. Just keep reintroducing yourself. You need to go to the world that she now lives in instead of trying to drag her back to present time. Trying to get her to remember will only be painful for you both. The memories that she is having are still authentic, they just might be from before you were. Do you know what I mean?

The leading edge for one obscure branch of physics may be in Calcutta - if that were the case, and that were your interest, you would be an idiot to ignore Calcutta based on some magazine's ranking profile.      In general, there's no such thing as an absolute ranking system.  US and World News Report publishes the most referenced, but the whole system has a number of serious flaws.    The short answer is Tokyo probably ranks between 1 and 1000, depending on what particular aspect of physics you want to research, and that ranking is probably composed of 50% things you should care nothing about.|`|ZGU74bPKaa	57th

EeArGfskaa	strictly online no.    your state (CA - my state also) requires student teaching at multiple levels. This you cannot do online - you will need a school that can supervise your student teaching portion.     Further - CA only recognizes one online school - Western Governors. I do know of a few people who did their credential in this manner - mostly online, but they had multiple meetings with their mentor during the student teachign portion. From what they told me, it was a very very time intensive way to go.    You might want to look into the CalState system - they mostly hold their credentialing work after school hours. I teach in Los Angeles and know of quite a few teachers who simply went to Cal State.|`|4f39b99c52a20630de221dd45e127722aa	yes, there are many online credential opportunities. univ. of phoenix, devry, and many others offer online or mainly online credential programs. many state and uc's also offer distance education either online or at sattelite campuses. however, for a credential at least part of it will need to be completed in a classroom for whatever grade you plan on teaching.
8bc0fdf31e05f7fc5f7a7d8911734b0caa	I don't know about 5 reasons one must have a healthy relationship other than it reduces your stress levels and avoids emotional instability, LOL, but I can say that one of the most important characteristics of a healthy relationship is HONESTY.  Being able to openly tell one another how one feels, is crucial.  Once in a while, I will ask how our sex life is going, if he is satisfied, if there is anything I do that irritates him, anything he dislikes that I can change, if he is sick of me, LOL.  Seriously, I told him that the day he gets tired of me and has a roving eye and wants to cheat on me, to honestly tell me and I will be sad and traumatized, but not as traumatized if I found out he was doing it behind my back for fear of telling me the truth and fear of me breaking down emotionally.  I am glad we can openly talk about stuff like that.  It makes for one healthy relationship. And also, if your partner tells you he loves you, without you saying it first...... it truly means he does love you.  I never have to force it out of him and I know for a fact, he is loyal, faithful, truly cares about me deeply and loves me to death.

If the other kid truly is so funny, you have the ability to NOT laugh at him.  Plain and simple.     You need to start taking your classes more seriously, and his jokes less so.  You could ask to have your seat changed to the other side of the room...away from Mr. Funny.  And, if you were really listening to the teaching going on, or fully concentrating on the assignment at hand, you wouldn't hear him.  Maybe without you as his audience, he'd stop performing.    As for the comments she makes about your being poor, I guess you could keep track of them and then have evidence and proof that she does do that.      Remember teachers are people too and having 30+ kids in a class is difficult enough without having to CONTROL them too.  Every kid is old enough to control him/herself...even you!

3VLvEeRUaa	When talking about the events in a novel, you are to ALWAYS use present tense.  So: "Frodo and his friends DECIDE to go...."    "Frodo and his friends decided to go to find and destroy the single ring, so the first thing they did was leave their homes." - This sentence doesn't sound very professional; it sounds like you're talking to a friend. Try: "Frodo and his companions endeavor to destroy the single ring. Thus, they depart from (town name) to begin their quest."  (I thought they only decided to go themselves and destroy the ring after the counsel in Elrond.)    "During the long way they run into the Black Riders, who captured Frodo and his companions." - This sentence is wordy, you can easily cut it down: "During their journey they are captured by the Black Riders."  (By the way, I thought Frodo wasn't actually captured by them?)    "They took Frodo and his friends to meet Strider, who told them he wanted to retrieve the ring and take control of the land." First, they didn't take Frodo to Strider did they? Frodo and his friends encoutered Strider at a pub they took shelter in.    "Stride figured out they too wanted the ring so that guide them to the land of Elrond, the elf by the escort if needed." This sentence is a mess. Try: "After discovering the hobbits wanted to ring, Strider agreed to guide them to the land of Elrond." What is "the elf by the escort" all about? And Strider didn't discover the hobbits wanted to ring, he just discoered that Frodo had the ring and was taking it somewhere.    "When we were there, they formed the fellowship of the Rings, as all had one goal and was to have the ring." - When "we" were there? This sentence is screwed up and doesn't accurately portray the events of the film and book. "When the company arrived, individuals of different races formed a fellowship purposed with destroying the ring."    The last sentence is just... well are you talking about when they were in the dwarf tunnels?
ZD4NOw2eaa	There isnt anything you can do about this... however if you are winning and they quit you will get the win.
OIRI5Ok7aa	2 is more right, but the quotation should be: "You can hide yourself in Mexico; that is the biggest city in America." or "You can hide yourself in Mexico, which is the biggest city in America."|`|yWoBYJVEaa	The policeman had mentioned the same thing to me: "You can hide yourself in Mexico, which is the biggest city in America."    You don't need the word 'saying'.  The colon indicates that you are repeating what the pliceman said.    I assume you are creating an alternate reality, one in which Mexico is a city, instead of a country.  Also, one in which there is only one American continent, not the two that we have, North America and South America|`|kkO87h0Xaa	The Policeman had mentioned the same thing to me. He said: "You can hide in Mexico City; it is the biggest city in South America."|`|vPdjudeiaa	ummmmm is mexico a city in america, too? i think its only a country, but okay.  2 but add a period after mexico
ULjZChqmaa	Positive- we can gain resources, expand our humanity, expand our country, learn more about a culture, learn more about how to live in certain conditions, ect. What ever you can discover and learn from, expand or take is good.  Negative- wiping out a culture, taking over a culture. Anything that destroys, takes away from things, over abuses things, ect is bad.|`|AA11211511	The negatives are that the area may lose its culture to the new culture. The nation colonizing will often want the people to give up new ways and adopt theirs.
1nTMR3W0aa	try putting madatory summer school in the search engine if something comes up try to find out why they have mandatory summer school    or    you can try doing a survey on this website under polls, the poll being do you think their should be mandatory summer schools and why or why not. then you may get many answers from many diffrent types of people young and old you may get some good answers that can help you debate
FZKFLTyLaa	Spelling and grammar might be a good start for classes.    Engineering and technology job classifications could run into thousands of different careers. I won't bother to list them all for you.

AA10863966	Just an idea, why not try to find some UAS students online, facebook or myspace, and chat with them?    Juneau is a medium city, and the capitol. You have to take a boat or place to get there. It is rather hilly and prone to rain, but also beautiful. Can be touristy and pricey becuase it is the capitol. And I have heard that housing is tight. UAS also has campuses in Sitka and Ketchikan, both are smaller satellite campuses in really amazingly beautiful places.   The Southeast is coastal and known to be wet. Here is a good site for climate information by region in Alaska,  http://climate.gi.alaska.edu/    And here is what will become some of your favorite footwear should you move there,  http://www.xtratufboots.com/    The UA system is actually quite good. It includes the UA Anchorage, UA Fairbanks, and UA Southeast. If you have a specific area of interest you might dig around and find out which campus is best known for that program. Also each region is unique in it geography and culture, if you are way into an outdoor hobby or sport again I would look for the best campus. IN theory they are all part of the one big UA system, but they don't always play well together.
FaX8awk1aa	in actuality, there was little conflict between the french and british in north america that caused the french and indian war.    This war was actually only a very small part of a much bigger conflict in europe called the seven years war which pitted france and england that somehow  filtered into north america|`|AM7CgQ4daa	D.    LOL thank you so much,  this has made my night.
jSa4DPZhaa	3 quarters, 1 dime,1 nickel, and 10 pennies is the least.      1 quarter,1 dime,1 nickel, and 60 pennies is the greatest.
PQJyaFDXaa	The 19th century was outside the golden age of the Persian Empire, so that's not an easy question to answer.  I'd say look at the architecture of the leading buildings at the time.  They made some advances in earthquake proofing buildings as well as natural cooling (particularly look at the construction of bazaars built at that time.)    Culturally, small portraits and pictures made by Persian artisans became all the rage in London (I think they started in this timeframe.)
suu9JuhBaa	Just stop and plan to buy yourself something you like with the money you save.   Don't think about it so much. The nicotine goes out of your body in about 3 days or near that so go do something for 3 days to keep yourself busy.   Also use patches and don't smoke when you have them on.
