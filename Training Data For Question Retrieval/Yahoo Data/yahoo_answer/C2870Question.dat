Anyways, as the title mentions, I pulled up at a Mickey D's Drive-thru location in Arlington off off Cooper and Abram..I asked for a small coffee. everything went usual..i opened the lid and poured cream and sugar and then I took a sip..it didn't taste bad, but it didn't taste like coffee.. i opened the lid and it wasn't coffee color. then i sipped it again..i know this taste..i suddenly realized that this is that Lipton black pekoe tea. man, i was so mad..i had asked for coffee, but it was too late.. i had driven away and the reciept was long gone and destroyed in the trash can.      has anyone had this happen to you?   by the way, what do you think about the McCafe? I tried the cappuchino and the hot chocolate so far and i did not like it..everything is fine, except there is this weird taste that comes along with the hot chocolate and the cappuchino..i think it might be the taste of the black lid im tasting..i dont know. past months, Mickey D's been coming out with some changes..McCafe, McDouble? what is up with that?
