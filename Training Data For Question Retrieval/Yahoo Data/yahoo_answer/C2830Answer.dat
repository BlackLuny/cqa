It is so good.  I moved from AZ a few years ago and miss all the good Mexican food restaurants.  It's near Old Scottsdale and some hospital.  Can't remember the street name, but it's worth looking for.  The decor is nice too.|`|Z8MfMHHGaa	Yelp.com is also a good site to check out.

piZ4xDBqaa	Congrats!  Good first job - meh.  There are no good fast food jobs.  It'll get you started in the workforce, and give you an idea of what it's like to earn a paycheck.  The best thing about working fast food is that it's a real motivator to get an education so you don't have to do it your whole life.<br>  <br>  Raises - I don't know for sure.  Most companies that size have review policies in place.  I'd expect something like an initial review after 3 months, then reviews every six months after that.  You'll probably get a raise, but don't expect much.<br>  <br>  You're probably home free, assuming you're smart enough to catch on to what they want, and willing to work hard enough to do it.  If it's newly opening, you're going to find a lot of your new co-workers can't handle the grind and quit after a few days.  So the place probably won't be firing, they'll be hiring.  Also, they probably "borrowed" a few experienced workers from other stores in the area, and those people will have to be replaced when they return to their home stores.

vgUxoi5Caa	So much fun! Definitely a unique dining experience. I'm not sure if they do this at the place you're going to, but ask them to build a volcano out of onions. It's the coolest thing ever!|`|bZud91iuaa	It's called Japanese Teppan Cooking and the chef's at good Teppan restaurants are highly trained.  Ask them to flip the prawn into his chefs hat or build the onion volcano.  If the chef is particularly good and is personable it is customary to tip him separately from the waitress. $5.00-$10.00 is enough.|`|24cde8bf3f4cbca12a1379054950f95aaa	i go often its a fun night -i like the shrimp whats your fave? the one i go to is called Kampai i think it means salute in japanese try saying it tonight if you take a drink or a sake|`|h7CvumEmaa	i have done it.  i think its fun to watch the chefs do the tricks, but only like 3 times. <br>  <br>  plus the i think the food is just overpriced chinese fried rice.|`|0011Smdtaa	Wow !!!

n9PMD8OYaa	Hey!!<br>  <br>  Think a lot of nightclubs are available for hire on the nights that they are not open to the public. Many are free, provided you adhere to a minimum spend.. (maybe not so common in very central London), but you should look on the websites for more details. Found one at Evny just from doing a quick search on Nightclub Finder.

Don't know if it's close to you  though.|`|3uI0JAAwaa	The best places that I go to are the Woodlands Seafood, see link below.  Alos, you might try calling a few other places.  Bluewater seafood, Champions Seafood, and I think it is called J&M seafood.<br>  <br>  I am very cajun and have a few large boils every year.  These guys usually have the biggest for a decent price.  The woodlands seafood always had the best batch for me though, but I am sure it is out of your way unless you live in North Houston.  <br>  <br>  If you really want to do it right, drive to Beaumont and go out to any of those places you see off of I-10.  That is where the big ones are.|`|Zbuv46bxaa	HEB and most of the asian supermarkets near Bellaire area.

ys3BaG1paa	MYTH!! I worked at Subway and helped prepare the food, and there was nothing gross about it. The veggie patties come frozen, that is probably the only gross thing that we served, and not many people ordered them. Actually, all the meats are pretty much delivered frozen, but they're still fresh, so don't worry.<br>  <br>  The lettuce is delivered in bags, (NOT frozen lol!) as are the carrots (grated) and most of the other vegetables, but the tomatoes come whole and we slice them with a machine. Everything is fresh, and kept at the right temperature--yes, even the salads have a thermometer stuck in them!--and things like the teriyaki chicken are made on-site. The diced, cooked chicken comes frozen and we mix it in a bowl with the pre-made sauce and separate it into portions--it takes ages to do. The other chicken fillets are frozen, too, and I think they come from Ingham's or something.<br>  <br>  The bread is straight-forward...the dough is delivered in long, thin rolls, which are kept in a 'retarder' (like a fridge) and are removed when defrosted. They are put in the oven for a few minutes, then when they start to cook, they're taken out and herbs and oats and whatever are added, then they're put back to cook for the remaining time. <br>  <br>  The cookie dough is frozen in tiny little balls and kept in massive boxes in the freezer--they're taken out and put in the oven then sold. That's it.<br>  <br>  The meatballs are frozen, so they are put into a big dish and covered with marinara sauce, then cooked in the oven and kept heated for the whole day. Cheese comes in packets, wraps come in packets, cold cuts come in packets...that's pretty much it.<br>  <br>  At the end of the day, the food that has been there for more than two days (three, max.) is thrown out, and the food that is still fresh is put back in the fridge. The whole area is swept and washed down, and all ready for another day.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps answer your question! Don't worry about Subway, it really is fresh...well, it was where I worked, anyway :)|`|Svanlzg7aa	Personally, the only thing I eat from subway is the tuna. I think their cold cuts look disgusting. Have you ever seen what they try to pass off as "roast beef"? Totally gross.|`|a4e971e4ecd5f35c24d665e6dc1d67cbaa	It is a myth and also competition to that pizza place you mentioned.Most ingredients are purchased from Subway's  main distribution. All the oils and vinegars are basically the same as that pizza place.The only thing wrong with subway is that they do not put enough meat on it unless you pay more
