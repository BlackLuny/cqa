I have just been onto a website that calculates the width and length of your tank to get how many inches of fish it can hold, (my tanks a ten gallon) I entered 20 inches length and 10 inches width, and it came up with that i could have 16 inches of slender fish or 10 inches of full bodied fish... so does that mean i can have      3 corydoras catfish    1 mystery snail    & 5 guppies      2 live plants   heater   gravel   sponge filter    ornament      in my ten gallon tank?

20090304103804AAMnOAa	Pets;Other - Pets	Question for pet foster families?	I have heard foster parents of animals say that they are "failing" with that animal.  I originally thought that meant that the foster parent was failing to get the animal accustomed to home life and was having behavior problems with the animal. Recently, I read something which leads me to think that failing with a foster means that the parent is becoming attached to the animal and might just make it a pet.  What does it typically mean? I'm curious because many rescue groups that I look at do foster care instead of a shelter.

20090304102604AA5HCf6	Pets;Dogs	I don't know what to do about my dog.....?	While we were on vacation last week and our dogs were at the sitter's, our toy fox terrier (5 yrs old) got bit by a doodle on his neck and needed a drain put in and stitches. He got the drain out, but the stitches still need to be in for another week. My question is...what do we do with him during the day while we're at work so he doesn't scratch at his neck all day long? When we're home he doesn't even touch it, but today is the 2nd day that we've come home to a disaster. My husband went home to check on him at lunch, and he managed to rip off a sock we taped around his back paw, a t-shirt sleeve we put around his neck, he chewed up our shower curtain liner, my husband's glasses, and got blood all over our bath mats and the wall. We can't put him in his cage because he'll just scratch himself, we can't put a cone on him because of where the stitches are, we put him in the bathroom because we have another dog that we were trying to keep him separated from while we're not home until it heals........I don't know. I'm just at a loss. I'm pregnant on top of it, and feel like I'm going to have a nervous breakdown every day that I come home from work because it's always something. Any help or ideas that you have would be greatly appreciated!! Thanks so much!!

20090304102653AADBL1y	Pets;Dogs	I need some advice on training collars for a running dog.?	I have a 10 or 11 month old dog who loves to run, and will not come back when you call for her. I'm disabled and she's too fast for me to catch her, it's a real ordeal trying to get her to come back home. I live in the country and keep her on a chain when she wants to go outside, but usually she's an indoor dog. She will sometimes slip off the leash when I go to transfer her to the chain, then the trouble starts, she's off and running and I really don't want to see her get hit by a car, or maybe just run off and get lost somewhere. She's a tall dog, about 40 to 43 pounds, hound mix, definitely a scent hound, she gets a scent of something and she;s gone.   I am going to buy a training collar to hopefully break her of this habit, which will also let me take her off the chain in the backyard. Eventually, this summer I plan on having an invisible fence installed. I would need a strong collar for her, one that would hopefully work in conjunction with the fence. Does anyone here know of a training collar, with remote, that has enough power to dissuade even the strongest running dog? Hopefully a training collar with remote, that can be used with an invisible fence at a later time.   I would greatly appreciate the opinions and advice from those who either use, or have used a training collar.   Thank-you.

20090304110421AAaYvwn	Pets;Birds	Choices - Cockatiel -Or- Green Cheek Conure?	They both about the size I want, and I want a bit quieter bird. Not a silent bird since I know that is impossible, but nothing loud and screeching like a sun conure or cockatoo.       I want a bird that is cuddly-like, one that wants to be taken out and be with me, but can be fine alone in it's cage and play while I am gone at work for a portion of the day.      I want the type of bird that will sit on my shoulder and chill as I do things on the computer or watch TV or do any other daily things. One that I can play with, with toys or some random thing around the house.       I don't care about talking ability or bright fruitful feathers, I just want a fun loving good bird that bonds well with me and wants to be with me.   However I don't want to pay $1000 for just the bird alone. I can't afford that, but I don't want some cheapo $25 bird either, I have a feeling I am going to pay a lot for bird anyways because I live in New Mexico and I can't find hardly any bird breeders out here.      Also I do plan on getting a hand raised bird. And I do live in an apartment building, and noise is fine as long as it isn't all day long loud screeching and no loud noise past 10PM.      So what bird is right for me?      -----------------------

His current shampoo, "Groomax: One-step Shampoo and Conditioner" is making his coat all hard and bristly, and I'd like to try something else. His hair is growing long, (prepping for showing season!) and he's got a very light coat (gold, silver, and white), are there any shampoos that you could find at a Petsmart or a Petco that would be good for such a coat? And another question, I clean the fur by his eyes everyday, and I need a shampoo that won't hurt him, but will get rid of these hideous red stains the tears are leaving behind. Any suggestions? Also, should I invest in conditioner as well? Thank you so much! And if you just have any tips about Shih-tzus whatsoever, feel free to leave them!

20090304111538AAjQZ19	Pets;Dogs	Have you been to Luv My Pet/Petco?	I went there one time, but never again. I don't think the LMP reps are knowledgable. Anyone going should do their homework. I didn't and regret it, even though my dog is fine.    All vaccines can have side effects so it makes no sense to get shots that are not required. I was told I needed corona and bordetella. I questioneded  the Bordatella because my dog isn't boarded or in any day care and not around other dogs. But she insisted I get this along with Corona. I  found that I wasn't going to be able  to make it to follow up appts because of situation that will have tied up , so I called some vets. Thank God it worked out that way!     I found out Corona isn't even being given to dogs in this area anymore and giving it to an adult dog is totally useless.    I also purchsed the fecal test and so far I have not gotten the results in spite of emailing them three times.    This pink carbon copy LMP calls a "certificate" is hardley readable. It doesn't even list all the shots LMP says I paid for.     I plan to get my dog spayed and need this info plus the results of the fecal test before they will spay her.    I was uncomfortable when I entered the van where the shots were given, but after having been in line over an hour and talking to others who had been there before I decided to go through with this. The table looked like a fold up table from Home Depot and wasn't even clean . I didn't see any disinfectant around to clean it  after each dog had been on it. There was no license certificate in site showing the person who adminsitered the shots was even a vet.    She spoke very little and when she did, it was difficult to understand her because she had such a heavy accent.    I won't go back to Luv My pets. I would rather pay more and go to local vet that I know I can contact easily. I'll also dispute the charges with my bank and see if I can at least get some of my money back.    If it seems to good to be true... it probably is !       I

20090304110544AA4XzvA	Pets;Dogs	I posted this earlier about shelter dogs??????	I posted this earlier, but just looking for more replies.   Why do so many people assume that shelter dogs come with behavioral and/or health issues?      I have adopted several and never had a problem.      Most police dogs, search and rescue dogs, service dogs, dogs used in movies(The Wizard of Oz, Benji, and many others), etc etc etc were at one time rescue dogs.          * 2 hours ago       * - 4 days left to answer.      Additional Details   Or is it maybe the fact that people just don't bother with training these dogs and putting in a LITTLE effort once they get them?      If they are too lazy, or unable to put in just a LITTLE effort, then they sure as shamrocks shouldn't be getting a puppy from a breeder.      2 hours ago   Getting a puppy from a breeder is also a gamble.      Anyway, what REALLY gets me is when people say "I've done my research, and dogs from shelters all tend to have behavioral problems and whatnot".      Sorry, no. Had they done their research, and talked to people who have adopted, they'd have found out quite the opposite.      38 minutes ago

It's stocked with 3 Zebra Danios and 2 small catfish (I forget the kind).  It took quite a while for the ammonia levels to ever register on my test kit (2-3 weeks), and then 2-3 weeks for the nitrites to appear.  The nitrates have been registering for 2 weeks or so, but the ammonia levels still don't seem to be dropping at all. Based on what I've read, the tank should take 6-8 weeks to fully cycle, and I'm past 8 weeks and the ammonia is still sky high.      I have diligently changed the water, and I don't think I over feed.  I do use Ammo-Lock to mitigate the damage from the ammonia, and I've used the bacteria in a bottle products, but they don't seem to make any difference that I can see.  I've also changed the filter twice already.      Any thoughts on what I can do to get the tank to finish cycling, or do I just need to wait longer?      Thanks!

A bump near the incision is present and the vet told me to keep her still. I should have called her Addie (for ADD). She isn't supposed to run in the backyard, go for walks, nothing!  Benedryl doesn't work. I was told that I would have to keep her still for 3-4 weeks in order for the incision to heal. HELP! I need medication to keep her still? One that is safe. The doctor first recommended acepromizine..but I read that it is not safe for full chested dogs (boxers, great danes..etc). When I brought this up...he said, true...so he suggested tradadol. Our conversation was over the phone. I am planning on bringing the dog into the vet later today (the vet wants to keep checking the dog). I'm a bit concerned. This is a petsmart vet.

20090227065306AAnxd7a	Pets;Cats	How can I tell if a cat is a stray?	This may sound like  a very silly question but, how can I tell if a cat belongs to anyone?   I moved into my house over a year ago and since then a very friendly cat visits us every day, the first time I saw him I was sitting in the garden and he sat on my lap. Surely if he was a stray he wouldn't do that right? In the last few week he has been coming to my house almost every day and he will eat 2/3 times a day so I assume no one else feeds him.    I would like to have him as my own but I don't want to end up unknowingly steeling him from someone.

20090304114658AADjM3z	Pets;Dogs	Cairn terrier has submissive urination-HELP!!!!!?	We adopted this cute little dog in Sept 2008.  She is 2yrs old and has submissive urination.  I don't know much about the previous owners other than they couldn't find a new home for the dog and was going to have her put down.  I have read articles about submissive urination but none of this information seems to help.  She acts like she has been abused or mistreated, she won't look at you and she hangs her head down and looks the other way like she is scared or has been traumatized.  I spoke to her breeder and she said these are smart little dogs and high spirited, but I can't seem to get her to turn around her behavior.  We have had her long enough that she should have come out of this by now.  She gets along well with our other dog but still pees wherever she is if something goes wrong and that could be anything, a sudden movement,noise she is scared of etc.  What can i do to keep this cute little dog and turn her life around?  We both have fallen in love with her but the peeing has to stop.  Please help us help our little cairn terrier.

20090304125034AAztc3z	Pets;Horses	My horse is terrified of poles!?	I'm sharing this horse with my mum's friend, and he has a problem :( She got him from a dealer who knew nothing of his past. He has mega trust issues, he's terrified of everything. She's owned him for almost a year now and he trusts her alot more now, and I started sharing a few months ago. He has realised I'm not going to hurt him and he's pretty trusting of us now. UNTIL we face him with something scary. We've done lots of spooking things, and its taken time but we've got through lots of things and i'm so proud of him. But the big problem is poles. Just normal jumping poles. I cannot lead him past a pole without him leaping in the air and pulling away. I've tried absolutely everything I can think of, I've worked with him in the school on the ground and in the saddle and he is just so terrified of it. The closest he'll get to it is about four metres then if I ask for another step he snorts, then rears up and backs up on his hind legs.      He's seven years old. As I said, we have no idea of his past, but he's obviously had a rough time. I can't just keep him away from poles as they are all around the livery yard and if we go out riding they are on the tracks. Also I don't want him to just always be scared of them, I'd love for him to happily walk over them. Thank you so much I really want to overcome his fears :) :)

Are there any other symptoms I should look out for incase it's something else, and is there anything I should be doing to help it or should I just sit it out?

20090304120515AAzEuaV	Pets;Fish	Two Tanks - which fish should go where?	I have two tanks, a 20-gallon rectangle shaped and a 28-gallon hectagon shaped. I think I've established (through my other questions!) that the tanks are not going to be large enough in the long run for the two fish that I have.      Oscar is in the 20-gallon rectangle and Jack Dempsey is in the 28-gallon hectagon      Jack Dempsey is roughly 6-7 inches and Oscar is about 4-5 inches. Neither of which I am sure what the maturity is- I wish I did know!      Should I swap the tanks and have Jack in the rectangle (so there is more swimming space) and put Oscar in the hect- it has more up and down space....      Eventually (talking maybe a year or so) I will get a larger tank- perhaps a 55-gallon and put them in it- do you think a year is too long of a wait time to keep them in the tanks they are in now until i get a larger tank?       How quick do these types of fish grow? I have heard that they will only grow as large as the tank they are in will allow them to grow; will they just remain small fish (bc they "stopped growing") if I put them in a 55-gallon in a year from now?

20090304121154AAqd1DP	Pets;Cats	Tips on introducing new cat to the home...?	I have a new cat.  He has been shut in the guest bedroom for about a week.  My other cats knows he's in there but just avoids the area of the house.  I can tell she isn't happy with the situation.  Yesterday I took the new one into another room and attempted to put her in the room to just to sniff around and get used to his smell, but she wants nothing to do with the room.  I am not sure what to do because we don't seem to be making progress.  I thing she would just avoid the room indefinitely.  Does anyone have any advice to ease this introduction, so our new cat can finally come out of the bedroom?  By the way, he is completely non-aggressive.  She hisses.  I doubt she would try to fight with him, but I just don't want her to become too upset and resent us.

Always when I take him for a walk he barks at other dogs no matter what their sizes are. He not only barks but he strugles in the leash wanting to get free of it and a hold of the other dogs. Today I used the treat trick. In the house he was obeying me and everythime I showed him the treat he would obey. But once we got out side no matter what I said or did with the treat he did not wanted it. He continued on doing what he wanted and acting like crazy. What should I do? HELP!!!!

20090304121530AACcHUO	Pets;Dogs	Dog won't stop eating seeds on walks!?	My 7 year old pug won't stop eating the seeds (from local trees) that litter the sidewalks. At first, during my walks he would ignore them but my boyfriend walks the dog in the evening (and using a different route), reporting back every time that he was eating seeds. Now, a few weeks later, he's begun eating seeds when I walk him!      It makes walks very difficult as I have to almost drag him away to get him to stop. Stern, curt vocal commands don't do anything. Walking away from him doesn't do anything. He would gorge himself on these seeds if no one intervened, I'm sure.      I've tried feeding him before walks to dissuade him. I've had him carry his favourite toy on walks, which stopped him from eating the seeds but also is a little distracting for him. My next idea is maybe bribing him with a treat (but only giving it to him at the end of the walk) to keep him from eating the seeds, but I'm open to other ideas if there are any.

20090304122948AAdmign	Pets;Fish	Sudden death of newly bought fish and water now very cloudy! how do you remove the cloudy water w/o chemicals?	i just bought my aquarium [10 gallons] a few days ago. i left the filter running for about 24 hours so all the chemicals would leech out. i also added water treatment to speed this process up. then, in 24 hours, i put in 5 neon tetras and 2 male fancy tail guppies. within the first hour, all of my neons died. we brought a water sample to petsmart, and they did a water test. our water was fine for our fish. they also told us that they just received a new shipment of fish the day before, and my fish probably died of stress [moving from their aquariums to petsmart to my aquarium.... bad mix]. how did the die, is that why, stress? after they died they all were sucked to the filter, but they did not go in it, they were only stuck in about 1/4 of the way. after they died i left them in there for a night and when i woke up to take them out to freeze them and return them, the water was cloudy. how can i remove this without using chemicals?

We have "Rainbow Fish", a pair of orange swordtails, a cluster of neons, a placostamous (spelling?), a vampire shrimp, two dwarf frogs, three albino fish that breath air but dwell at the bottom of the tank (i don't know their name), and two Loaches. (All of which are at least a few monthes old)      the local fishstore told me the Loaches would take care of our snail problem. And for a while, they did.      But suddenly, as if overnight, Our tank is infested with spiral-shelled snails that stick to the glass. WHERE did they come from? Did our Loaches suddenly decide to not eat them anymore?      What can we do to fix it? There are easily 50 in there right now.,      Also, they seem to "hide" at night. RIght before bed i feed the fish, and i can't see them at ALL.      I took a fishnet and used it to scrape the glass, but that is tedious and gross, and i'd prefer not to do it that way.      Also, our tank has natural rocks at the bottom that we found at the river and washed off, etc- i.e, not tank gravel. We also have real plants in the tank.

We are paying out $150-$300 every 6-8 weeks when he has a flair up.      We know this is going to be a life long issue and he is only 1 years old.      I don't think he can get put on Pet Insurance because of his preexisting condition.      I don't know how we are going to do between 10 and 15 years of this.      We have to but I don't know how we are going to do this?      We are newlyweds just starting out and this has taken such a toll on us financially and emotionally (he has been sick since he was 7 months old)      Any advice on how to deal with the emotions involved with caring for an ill pet that has a condition that is lifelong.      The hardest part is we were told he will not live as long as most dogs in his breed.         He has Chronic Pancreatitis....so what kind of lifespan are we looking at?      I don't want to lose him.

I have been handling and talking to them for 3 days, I let them have rest on the first day when they came.   They only eat when I'm not there. But when I stay quiet around them, they come out and eat and play. How do I get them more used to me?   Also, when I have just handled them, and put them back in there cage, they get all scared again and run and hide. When I go near their cage too.          Another question is:   One of them are more bigger and fatter then the other. I was told it's a female, I got them from a pet shop, and I read females from pet shops are likely pregnant when you buy them. The other one I was told is also a female. The fat female is a bit pear shaped, I didn't want to double check her gender or if she has nipples or a hard stomache untill she was more used to me. What should I do? And do you think she is pregnant? How do I tell?  Thanks for helping

20090304133530AACa1yB	Pets;Fish	Mean platy?? fin rot?? PLEASE HELP ME!!!!!?	i have had a 10 gallon up and running for 3 1/2 months now. i started with a betta, three cory cats, and an african dwarf frog. well the betta died from some kind of infection that i think he came with about a month after i got him, so i stayed with the cories and frog for a while, before getting a snail to help with my algae problem. now a couple days ago (sunday) i got three male platies and a female betta. i know this is crowded but the tank has lots of fake plants in it for hiding spots, and i'm over filtering, so i thought it'd be ok. i've seen one of the platies nipping the other two, but i thought it was just them, cause there's no damage. about a half hour ago i noticed that the bottom of my betta's anal fin has red on it (she has really pretty long fins for a female). i thought it was just fin rot until i noticed the mean platy nipping at her fins, too. what should i do?!?! i'm really attached to the betta, i love her so much. i'm really scared of her being ripped to shreds by this guy!      what should i do to fix the problem? i have an empty 1 gallon that i could put the betta in, but it doesn't have a heater (i can manage without a filter), and my house is cold.      i'm willing to get a bigger tank, but i only have room for i'm thinking a 20 gallon. it would have to fit on the tv cart that the 10 is on, which is 28x18. would a tv cart be able to hold that much water?   i'm also pretty broke (i'm 15)... so if i got a new tank it would have to be relatively cheap.      should i salt the water? i have aquarium salt, but i'm afraid of the snail being harmed by it. is there amount that won't hurt the snail, but will still help the betta's fins heal?      i've noticed that the betta's fins are a little torn up... (not just the redness) is there a chance that it really is fin rot, and not nips from the platy?      WHAT SHOULD I DO?!?!

Ive got a 9 week old shar pei, who is wonderful in the day and is already toilet trained to go outside, but at night she is terribly upset to be left. She is shut in the kitchen on her own with the door shut, but she has a crate with her bed and a blanket in and her rubber bone to chew on and access to water, with a lamp on and a radio. The kitchen is not particulary large and she goes to toilet on the paper provided for her. But she barks almost contantly and without drawing breath seemingly for most of the night and scratches and bites at the door. We have had her nearly a week and a hlaf and this doesnt seem to be getting any better. Its not feasible to have her upstairs with her as i get bad asthma in the night sometimes and my doctor has advised me not to have pets upstairs, and we want her to stay in the kitchen even when she is older. any ideas??

20090304135836AA3Aw5k	Pets;Dogs	Shock collars for dogs?	HAS ANYONE USED A SHOCK COLLAR TO PREVENT DOGS JUMPING UP ON PEOPLE????   I have a German Shepherd that is almost 2 years old ( 20 months to be exact )   Before we got her I researched different breeders for temperament.  She is not my first Shepherd,  I have had five in my adult life, sometimes two at a time.  Before we had children I Schutzund trained and titled two dogs.  I just want you to know that I'm not new at this.     I had her signed up for puppy classes before we even got her!   Our problem is that she is overly hyper, she jumps on everyone to the point where she is knocking them over, she's about 80 lbs.    Ive tried just about everything that I can think of.    I have been to three different training facilities. At school she is perfect, actually winning awards.  At home she is a totally different dog.  I have three older children (19, 16 & 13) she get's plenty of walking and play time.  When someone comes to the door she will jump on them and just NOT let up.  We've tried ignoring by turning our back and that seems to wind her up more.  I've tried the pinch / prong collar with a correction but that doesn't phase her.  I've tried treats and other distractions but she will even ignore the food in order to jump up on someone.  I use friends to come over and ring the door bell to "practice' being a good dog, but it hasn't worked.    No one in our family wants to keep this dog except me.  I can't give up on her.  I've been thinking of buying a shock collar.  Has anyone used it for jumping?

20090304143204AAvJKDe	Pets;Birds	Parakeet laying eggs!?	We have 6 Parakeets. Two are mates(named Carla and Stormy). We separated them into a smaller cage because Carla was acting like she was going to lay eggs soon. She recently laid 5 eggs(so far) and we know that they are fertile. She has been sitting on them for the past week, and Stormy has been feeding her(like he should). But Carla laid her eggs on the bottom of the cage. After she laid 2, we put in a nest. But she decided to stay on the floor. There are pine tree shavings/left over seed shells on the floor along with some droppings. My question is, is it OK if she hatches the eggs out on the floor? I read that she may not be able to keep them warm, and that droppings can make the eggs dirty. Is this true? If so, what do we do? We don't want to disturb her little nest that she made by placing the eggs in the real nest. She seems to like the one that she made on the floor. And when the chicks hatch, they can't fall though the floor, since it has a covering over the original wire flooring.   Please help! Any advice is appreciated! And if you know any great web sites, please let me know. =)   Also, I already know most of the basics of Parakeet egg laying...like nutrition, health requirements, age for Parakeets(1 year or more...) etc...

My dog's anal glands leaked daily so my wife and I decided to get them removed.  After her surgery and once she healed she is a completely different dog.  She has not grown fur back from the surgery, she is losing fur, she has zero energy and sleeps alot, she has gained weight and does not want to play anymore.  My dog is a boston terrier mix and is 5 years old.        Is it possible that the vet gave her to much anesthesia or that the surgery is the cause for this change?      We asked the Vet and he said low thyroid and she went on medication which did not help and then it turned into cushings disease testing and come to find out she may have atypical cushings.  I find it to coincidental that she may have atypical cushings and these problems immediately following her surgery.        Perhaps they removed something they should not have during the surgery?  Please offer any help or advice.  Thank you!

We're looking to buy some for insect control and I've read somewhere that if they cross state lines they have to be vaccinated.  Any help would be appreciated!

20090227072348AAkVBtG	Pets;Dogs	My Shih Tzu is having surgery today and I'm worried?	My Shih Tzu has surgery to get him umbilical hernia fixed and I'm extremely worried about it. Even more so now. Last night I out his food up before we went to bed at 8:30 because the vet said that he isn't suppose to eat after midnight. Well I forgot to tell my boyfriend that I put the food up and this morning it was back down again. I freaked out cuz he thought his daughter had put it up so he put it back down. I don't think that Jazz ate anything after midnight because he normally eats at about 9 and then sleeps the rest of the night. I took him out to pee a lot this morning but he does that every morning. He didn't poop in the house like he normally does so that worries me too. My only hope is that when my boyfriend gets to the vet Jazz poops on the vets floor because when we take him some where he normally poops on the floor because he's so scared. I know that sounds bad but I really hope he gets the the **** scared out of him litterally. Should I call the vet and tell him that he might of ate something or what should I do. I am scared but he really needs to have this surgery today because the vet is doing it for free (he forgot to do it when he was neutered.) and if I try to reschedule it again it won't get done until next Thursday.
20090227073634AANpWfa	Pets;Fish	Why does the Serpae Tetras have such a bad rep?	I have a 55 gallon with 12 Serpae Tetras & 12 Black Skirt Tetras and they have been together for 2 years now. They school together and get along so well and i've never seen the Serpae Tetras nip or chase my black skirts. When i tell people that I keep these fish together they tell me that I should seperate them because the Serpae Tetras would nip the fins or even kill my black skirts. I haven't had any tail or fin nipping going on and haven't lost one fish. So my question is why does the Serpae Tetras have such a bad rep?

20090227072943AAA3nSv	Pets;Dogs	HELP! I need to paper train a dog that I'm adopting!?	I'm adopting a 4 year old male neutered dog today. He's going from being a housebroken indoor/outdoor dog to a mainly indoor dog that's going to need to be paper trained (I live in an apartment building and can't be running up and down the stairs all the time with him). What's the best way to go about this? I plan to gate him in a bathroom when I leave the house, and put a bed, some toys, and newspaper in the room with him. Any suggestions on making this easier? I know to take him to the newspaper after he eats to encourage him. Anyone else have any good ideas?
20090227072705AAidaXD	Pets;Dogs	Do I have to take classes with my puppy?	Besides puppy socialization classes, I would rather be able to train her myself in obedience and tricks. I trained my mothers dog to sit, stay, shake, lay down.. and I was only 11 at the time. I am fairly confident that I can do it with her and turn her into a well behaved dog, but because she is a pit-bull of 4 months everyone insists that I MUST take her to obedience classes. If I'm reading different books by experts and watching videos, will that suffice?

I was just curious of the criteria for own the share would be.
