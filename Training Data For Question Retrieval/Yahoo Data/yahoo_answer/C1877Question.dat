20090308093712AAZ6T9f	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	Assigning Variables to digits in python?	I've been teaching myself how to program, and have come across a stumbling block. I'm writing a program that will run the 196 Algorithm (obviously not 196, but I thought it would be fun to try and write it for the numbers that work). If you're not familiar with this algorithm, it's pretty straight forward. You take a number like 56, reverse the digits so you get 65, then add 56 and 65, you repeat this process until you have a palindrome. But in order to do this I need to assign each digit in the entered number a variable, right? How do I do that? Thanks in advance.

My HOSTS file looks like this:      # Copyright (c) 1993-2006 Microsoft Corp.   #   # This is a sample HOSTS file used by Microsoft TCP/IP for Windows.   #   # This file contains the mappings of IP addresses to host names. Each   # entry should be kept on an individual line. The IP address should   # be placed in the first column followed by the corresponding host name.   # The IP address and the host name should be separated by at least one   # space.   #   # Additionally, comments (such as these) may be inserted on individual   # lines or following the machine name denoted by a '#' symbol.   #   # For example:   #   #      102.54.94.97     rhino.acme.com          # source server   #       38.25.63.10     x.acme.com              # x client host      127.0.0.1       localhost   ::1             localhost         And, everytime I try to change it so I could block websites (I have Firefox), it says:      Cannot create the C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts file.   Make sure that the path and file name are correct.      Everytime I try to save it, that shows. And the file EXACTLY says, hosts, with no extensions. But yeah, NOTHING will save.       Please help!      P.S.: On the HOSTS file, the only difference is that there's that ::1 localhost there. (I think)

So when I created local accounts for my kids, the password policies are a problem.      I tried to disconnect from the domain, but it wants a userid/password that has the authority to disconnect the computer from the domain.

20090306230059AAQ73py	Computers & Internet;Other - Computers	What's a good program to track and log my computer repaires?	I recently started my computer/laptop repair business and realize the importance of tracking jobs I've done, not just just to track clients but to quickly reference an old job. Sometimes I come across a problem I know I've encountered in the past, far enough in the past where the fix is not obvious to me. Rather than google a solution, sometimes it's faster to access a past solution, especially if its a quirky problem and solution. What is a good program for this purpose, free if possible, if not, low-cost? The program must have an efficient knowledge base that you can query and build upon. A professor of mine let of know of a good program, but it's been a while and I forgot the program's name.

I'm new to Java and we have to write a class called Passport that holds a String of countries Visited by the owner. The countries are listed in the following format:   "USA, 10; Canada, 12; Greece, 5"   If I need to count the number of countries visited by the owner of the Passport, I'd have to count the number of semicolons + 1, since the starting entry doesn't have a semicolon. Question is, what method of String can I use to count the number of ";" in my String?      Thanks!

DON'T waist your time telling me they are good computers, and that I should get one. Plain and simple I DON'T WANT A MAC.
