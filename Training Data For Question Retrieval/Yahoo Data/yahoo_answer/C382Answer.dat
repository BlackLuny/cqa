1tilPTPVaa	Well, it is nigh on impossible to make your own plywood.  As far as commercially available 2x's they are mostly Spruce, Doug-Fir, or Southern Yellow Pine (pressure treated).  I don't think (when you place some value on your time) that I could make a kiln-dried spruce 2 x 4 cheaper than I could get from the lumber yard.  <br>  <br>  All that being said:  If you are making a half-pipe one can safely assume its gonna be outside (unless your living room is a lot bigger than mine). So I would use PT-SYP, both framing and sheathing|`|h2KkiKK3aa	both plywood and 2x4's are usually soft wood like spruce and fir, rarely hardwood.|`|flkVehA9aa	2x4's and plywood are made out of many different kinds of wood, but the most common is yellow pine.|`|wj8FNY7Vaa	pine spruce and fir are the most common trees that provide  construction grade 2 x 4 s.  The same is true for plywood.   <br>  <br>  But for you cut dry and  mill and your own lumber would not only be unpractical but it would take a year or to dry the lumber by air.   <br>  <br>  Also the lumber you would need to construct an outdoor half pike would be treated lumber.  You could use untreated (cheaper than treated) as long as you paint it on all sides.  But even painted if it is touching soil it is very susceptible to rot.<br>  <br>  I think you would be best served to try to get together with a group of other people with your interest in a half pike and share the expense and build it right.|`|944iJNAdaa	I don't know about your part of the country, but I live in Oregon, where a large part of the lumber products are produced for the western part of the U.S.  Here, 2 x 4's are almost always from Douglas Fir, and plywood is made from White Fir.<br>  <br>  Actually, lumber prices are the lowest right now that they've been in years.  If you're wondering if you can cut some trees down and make your own lumber, I bet you find it's more expensive than the lumber you can buy.  I've hired small mills to convert some of my own trees into lumber, and it's rarely paid off, and the lumber isn't generally as good, either.  If you can work with logs that don't need milled into lumber, of course that opens up a lot more possibilities.|`|zM9Lj21waa	you will need to buy the plywood but you can get rough cut hemlock 2x4's from the amish at a very good price...|`|blP9aTcLaa	Construction grade 2x4s are made from spruce and your plywood is made from fir,there is also sheeting aspenite sheeting that is a mixture of fir wood chips and glue,this is no good for wet conditions as it takes in water and expands and rots,if you are keeping this outside you would want to use pressure treated lumber for framing and exterior grade plywood but will still have rot problems with the plywood if it is going to be outside in the weather,I would look into a plastic panel for your sheeting as it would not rot and would have a smooth finish,I would think these trees would be found in pennsylvania but I dont know about the forestry industry there,I am located in Ontario Canada and we have lots in Canada but it is still expensive here|`|QH5ODCx8aa	2x4's for this application are typically 2nd grade pine (#2 pine). <br>  If it will be outdoors, you should use pressure treated (wolmenized) pine.<br>  Ply wood is thin sheets of pressed wood glued together, could be from a variety of woods (pine, oak, cedar, etc..)<br>  <br>  <br>  If you attempt to build it from lumber you cut yourself, it will quickly rot and wouldn't be worth the effort. You would be better off buying treated lumber that is made to withstand the outdoor elements. <br>  If you are stubborn and feel you have to do it this way or die trying... Cedar will last longest of the untreated types of wood.

You mention 2 doors and a window.  How about putting shutters on the window in a bright color, like yellow or red, or a fun pink?  Or -- match it to your house colors.    In the gravel area, add more gravel, or change this to grass if you can.  If you don't want a fresh white fence, I'd just stain the fence to either match any steps you might have on the house (or any woodwork) or a color that works best with your house.    How large is the concrete area?  Consider faux-painting the concrete to look like slate (after powerwashing of course).  Use large potted plants to fill area and also add a garden table and chairs.    This is tough without seeing it, but I hope this helps.
dd15228a42b4652d8768334912349b61aa	Well the first thing is that you are not growing them correctly, they should never get as tall as your roof.    Buy them again as yu did last year [your lucky in having a green house] and plant them out.    The thing to remember about these plants is that you are only looking to have seven main "branches" coming out from the main stem.  As they grow you will find that small branches appear in the "v" of where there is a branch already against the stem ~ this small one you should pinch out, leaving the main one to grow, do this as the plant grows until you have the seven main ones, once you get this, pinch out the top of the plant to stop it growing any taller.    You will then get full size toms growing, and they will turn and not stay green ~ at the end of the growing season, you will be left with some green ones, pick them off, place the bigger ones on a window ledge, and they will turn, the others you can use the make chutney.    Hope this helps.|`|FlsrXuJOaa	when a plant grows that tall and the fruit doesn't ripen, it's usually an indication of not enough light. a tomato will want a full day of hot sun in order to produce ripe fruit.

7831010767e13fd92e98f42d4a2ef7aeaa	It sounds like you do need a replacement. You're definitely at the end of the life span of the heater.    However, those prices are absurd. You may be able to go with a 40 gallon, which will save you a ton of money. Only thing is, electric water heaters are much slower than gas heaters to recycle - that is, once you've used up the hot water, it takes them much longer to get hot again. That's why in a borderline situation, it may be ok to use a 40 gallon gas heater but require a 50 gallon electric heater. It really depends upon how many fixtures you have in your house, and your expectations in terms of availability. With a 40 gallon electric tank, if several people take a shower, they'd better be quick or the last person will be cold.    Regarding the cost of installation - insane. Installing an electric water heater takes less time than it will take the service guy to drag your old tank out of the basement. Really, we're talking 10-15 minutes for an experienced installer. With a gas unit, you have to connect the gas line and vent, make sure there's no leaks, etc. With the electric one, you hook up the water lines, connect the electricity, and you're done.|`|3W18HDxxaa	no   go with a 40 gal    get  3 more Quotes at different places|`|4SGBr8cWaa	$500 labor is obscene, i install for $150 plus parts|`|cplaV2KWaa	First, ask your installer exactly what emissions an electric water heater gives off. Any other answer than "none" is unacceptable. A 14 yr old water heater has a thick build-up of minerals and salts on both the bottom of the tank and the elements. Every 1/8 " thickness build-up on the elements will increase your heater power consumption by 20%. For immediate relief, change your elements. Beware though. The weight of the deposits in the bottom of a tank have been known to drop the bottom out of the tank eventually.Best answer, new tank, different installer.

zeXMAsF7aa	A 4" slab will be plenty if you are parking a car or a pickup on it. When you call to order it they will probably ask what mix you will want which would be 4000psi or 6 bag mix and ask them if they have fiber. Fiber is a reenforcement that is added to the concrete so that you don't have to use a wire mess.  I would order 3  1/4 yards it comes to 3 yard but you should always order 1/4 to a 1/2 yard extra to be on the safe side if you run short most companys won't haul you less than a yard and they might charge you a small load charge also so its better to order a little extra then to run short. I live in wisconsin and right now concrete is $100 a yard plus $7 a yard for fiber. to figure out how much concrete you need if you change your mind on the side just find the sq. footage and then multiply it by .81 for a 4" slab.

72ef78c3205dba97ba85c7ff5642145baa	I feel your pain!  I have an OLD ivory colored counter top, that was considered part of the last "makeover" done in the 1960's.  The thing was just hard to take in the condition it was in, but I needed to keep it, until funds are available to re-do the WHOLE kitchen.  So one day, with the sun streaming through, I decided I would risk it and try a few of my "recipes", and see if I could stand to live with as long as possible.  My first jab at it was simply to clean it thoroughly, this went a long ways to just making what REALLY needed to be addressed manageable.  I had one spot that no matter what I was going to do, wasn't probably going to go away (a former tenant had set a hot pan and burnt the thing (as if the stains weren't enough?!).  I did try and remove some of it with stuff called "Barkeepers Friend".  It not only removed some of the stains on the counter top, but a bit of the lesser burned parts too.  I wouldn't recommend this EXCEPT as a last resort, as it is abrasive!  But if you have no choices left, go for it, but use a LIGHT hand on it!  I used a bleach solution (a spray bottle filled with hot water and 2 capfuls of bleach) mixed with like two drops of dish washing liquid (for handwashing dishes) and let it sit for about 15 minutes, then thoroughly washed and rinsed it.  It was AWESOME!  The change was dramatic!  It cleaned away all the stains really nice and then I applied the Barkeepers Friend to the burnt spot to remove what I could of that and then used some construction adhesive to glue a nice little cutting board like tile over the burnt spot.  Looked great now!  Sad point was, the tile eventually cracked, water was getting behind it, so I scraped it off, and glued down ANOTHER ONE and this time, applied some caulking around it to keep water and crumbs from getting under it like the other one.  Now it looks cool, I can use it as a quickie cutting board and it covers that burnt spot nicely (no one but me knows its there) and I can live with this until the kitchen re-do, now put on hold because our budget is non-existent right now.  I also used a wax called Bowling Alley Wax and lightly waxed the top (I figure how bad could it be?).  Now it looks like brand new and shiny and when it wears off, I just cleaned the whole top (about 7 feet) and re-do it by cleaning it thoroughly and re-waxing.  I have been living with it for 6 years, while I have scraped together money for the kitchen, which has now been spent on gum!  LOL!  Hope this helps you!  Good luck!|`|rHwE5Rkbaa	Best bet is to use one part chlorine bleach, one part water, and a butt-load of salt.  Mix the mess up in a bow (make sure you use gloves!!), and then pour it on the counter.  Smear it around quickly to make an entire section wet, and then go back to one part and start scrubbing.    The half-dissolved salt will act as a mild abrasive.  The bleach will help get the deep stains out (which are what you have).  Make sure that you leave the bleach solution on the countertop for at least five full minutes... and don't let it evaporate.  You can add a little extra water as needed to keep it moist.    You may have to do this a couple times to get the deep stains out, but it will work.  It worked fine on my ivory countertops!|`|FXnHE7mmaa	http://www.naturalhandyman.com/iip/infco...  You can try this...the baking soda paste and let it sit..hope this helps you.

d94f99ad1710d80ab4587d8db787acb3aa	luvacat3, my professional and personal opinion is that latex and water based paints are for interior/exterior walls and exterior trim only.  I always use oil on casework and trim; it provides whats known as an architectural grade finish and real durability; not to mention that oil paint can be later easily sanded and repainted or touched up.  Oil will prevent this problem from happening to you and provide a painted finish that's unparalelled in aesthetics.<br>  <br>  In remodels and restoration I either strip the windows down and either strip sand them or have them dipped to strip the old paints and finishes; obviously the condition of the windows and coats of paints determines which process I implement.  Now, once the window is ready to start restoring you want to apply an alkyd-oil base primer and then your choice of paint.  Good oil paints are readily available through Pratt & Lambert and Sherwin-Williams though I have to say I prefer Pratt & Lambert.<br>  <br>  Now, with the windows you have already painted with latex, apply 100% Pure Silicone Spray to the tracks and frames and immediately operate the windows.  Once they glide nicely take a rag with some mineral spirits/thinner and wipe off any excess overspray.  This silicone will prevent the two surfaces from creating any bond.

We are in UK and have to keep our Money plant inside, except for really nice summer days. They do drop their leaves, but it's usually when they need watering. We have seen them growing by the road in Tenerife, they were at the bottom of a small dip and this part of the road lay under water for a time after a bit of rain, but I would think this soon dried out, and would not be wet for very long.   Give your plant time to dry out and do not over water when the weather is cooler. You can cut them right back and they take a while, but new bits do sprout out again. They had two or three in our chip shop window, and one day they were both cut back to the base, the owner said his mother did this to them every couple of years to stop them getting top heavy, using the cuttings to make new plants. We have done this once to ours a few years ago, and may cut a bit more back again in the summer. Good luck with yours, if all our money trees loose a few leaves, then maybe the saying that they reflect our finances is true with the credit crunch!|`|4tV1zITNaa	A number of rather similar, large shrub-like Crassulas are widely grown as house plants with common names of Jade Plant/Tree, Money Plant, Dollar Plant/Tree. All are varieties of Crassula ovata which is synonymous with the older names Crassula argentea, Crassula portulaca and Crassula obliqua so may be sold under any of these names. Jade plants are popular because they are incredibly easy to grow. With proper care and time they make fine specimens not unlike bonsai trees.        The commonest problem is probably overwatering, sometimes coupled with a dark location on top of a filing cabinet or kitchen cupboard. In order to grow these Crassulas really well, one should remember their natural habitat on dry hillsides under the blazing South African sun      Rain there is infrequent and usually occurs during the winter months, which are generally much warmer than ours. Consequently, Jade plants will flower during the late winter and behave in the same way in the Northern hemisphere. The flowers have a faint perfume like scented soap.      Location    A Jade plant needs very bright light to grow well and a sunny position if it is to flower. At the same time, good air circulation will help to avoid scorch on hot days and excessive humidity in cold wet weather. A plant should not be moved suddenly from a shady position into full sunshine, but needs to be acclimatised slowly, or damage to the leaves is likely. If this happens, the leaves will be dropped and replaced in time, so the damage is not permanent.     Jade plants will grow well outside as patio plants during the summer and their leaves will colour up in the sun, but remember to bring them indoors before the first frosts.      The plant will stop growing at temperatures much above 90F. Jade plants will survive cold conditions to just above freezing if the soil is kept dry but must be kept frost free at all times. Cold night temperatures may help to promote flowering. (See right)      Watering     It is best to water thoroughly and then let the plant dry out between waterings. The plant needs water when its lower leaves become soft and in an exteme case become wrinkled. When water is given, these leaves will plump up again, a sign that all is well with the roots. Do not keep the soil moist all the time.      It is fine to water from the base by standing the plant pot in a dish of water, but never leave the plant standing in water for more than a few hours. Then always pour away any excess water that has not been taken up into the soil.      A few leaves drop off naturally, especially when it is hot or if the plant is kept dry for a long time. If the leaves wrinkle or drop off excessively despite provision of water, something is wrong with uptake of water into the plant. Do not immediately assume that the plant wants more water if you have been watering it regularly. If the roots are not taking up water, then adding more will lead to soggy compost and cause more problems. Check the roots, if necessary by removing the plant from its pot. This operation will do no harm if carried out carefully.      Examine the roots of the un-potted plant for sign of pests such as root mealy bug. Look for rotten roots and soft rotten areas at the base of the stem, which can be caused by soggy conditions and which stop effective water uptake. If the bottom of the stem has gone soft, allow the plant to dry off out of its pot and then assess the condition of the stem. In emergency, it is possible to salvage the plant by re-rooting the healthy part. Cut the stem well above the damaged area, allow the cut end to dry off for a couple of weeks and then re-plant into a dry potting mix. Water very sparingly until root formation has started.          It is not necessary to mist or spray water over the foliage, and excessive humidity may lead to mildews and other fungal problems. Spraying with water may also remove the attractive surface bloom from the leaves of some cultivars. However, putting the plant outside in the rain on a mild day occasionally, helps to wash off dust and freshen up the foliage.      Soil and fertiliser     A Jade plant can not be expected to grow well in the same soil for years. Frequent re-potting into new soil and a slightly larger pot will help the plant to grow well. The soil mixture is not critical and any general houseplant compost is fine. However, a free-draining mixture with the addition of up to a third by volume of added grit and/or sharp sand is preferred. My personal preference is to avoid peat-based composts as these seem to encourage pests such as root mealy bug.      To maintain a plant at about the same size, treat in a similar way to a bonsai tree. Prune the roots when re-potting into the same size pot and cut back the stems to maintain a pleasing shape. This will help to develop a thick main trunk. Prune back to just above the rings on the stems where the old leaves were located. New leaves will grow from these locations. Do not be afraid to cu

ihbqJAGUaa	Gate valves seldom hold  100% with age. Gate valves mechanism is all brass with no washer to deteriorate. I agree modern ball valves are much better for positive shut off of water. It is not against any plumbing code to put a new full port ball valve on your side of the water meter and use it exclusively to shut your main water line off. New ball valve may be made of stainless steel or brass. Carbon steel valves of any kind may not be used on potable water systems anywhere.|`|3W18HDxxaa	no as long as the gate valve is there.    gate valves  are pressure rated  and seal better  and are made from hardened steel so it will usualy seal   when others have a seat  [made from brass] that can wear out and leak    even ball valves have a ceramic or plastic seal    and are made from brass or soft steel|`|AA10725997	I agree with Ed. I have had far more problems with gate valves than ball valves.    They can break in either the on or off position which can really be inconvenient. They usually break on me in the off position after performing minor plumbing repairs.I will often use the main shut off at the street if I see an old gate valve.    If you are required to use a gate by local codes (I don't know your codes but here in California a ball valve is fine) put the ball valve after it and use it for your shut off.

Most people I know with septic systems do treat the ground over it as just part of the yard, but no driving on it like you said. But I do know someone who, due to county regulations that required it in his area, had to plant certain kinds of plants over the entire drain field area. So make sure there aren't any special requirements like that where you live.

Smaller variety, reaching only 15-20 ft. tall. Large white flowers with yellow center are incredibly fragrant. It blooms in the late summer. I have seen it mostly sold as a multi-trunk variety rather than a tree-form. <br>  <br>  Brackens Brown- my favorite! Large glossy evergreen leaves. It can get 30-50 ft. depending on your zone. It has huge white flowers in the summer that smell like a citrus fruit. The backs of their leaves are a fuzzy brown color, and their seed pod looks like a pine cone with red berries. very cool!<br>  <br>  Saucer Magnolia- Light pink flowers in early spring before it has leaves. Gets rather tall, 25-35 ft. Very popular in the 60s so you will see a ton of them in old neighborhoods. <br>  <br>  Jane Magnolia-early spring bloomer a very beautiful deep pink color. Gets 15-20 ft. tall. I have also seen this one mostly in bush form<br>  <br>  Royal Star- White flowers in early spring smell great! The flowers are smaller, but the tree will be loaded with them. I have seen them get about 10 ft. tops. Has a really pretty white bark. <br>  <br>  hope this helped|`|9fjyU1ctaa	the leaves are quite large and leather like.  they get caught in lawn mowers.  in the South, the trees sport very large white perfumed flowers in the spring and early summer.  the bark is almost black and quite smooth.|`|03ec65bf77c70de35e61bf195676e487aa	Very tall, spreading, with very large dark green leaves, and magnolias in the summer.|`|wXyoo8mNaa	there's 2 main kinds saucer mag. which grows 2 about 30 ft and star mag which grows 2 about 15 feet.The saucer has large whit and pink blooms early may into june and the star has white flowers not really star shaped, like a dogwood but more like an asterisk,flowers early may.Both have smooth grayish bark the saucers trunks grow much larger than the star,which tends to look like a large bush.
p2G5KJywaa	are you staining already set grout or gonna set tiles?<br>  <br>  you can probably order it online<br>  or<br>  <br>  you could make your own but it'd depend on the grout base...mineral spirits, linseed oil or acrylic etc...find out for sure what the base is and go to your local paint store for some of that and get some pure colorbase what ever colors you want or need to mix and match, it's not hard to do...just mix a small sample and see if you like it.
AA11305474	There are 3 things I have used to remove it:  Mostenbokers paint remover, Carbona paint removing formula and Goof off.  You can all 3 at the large discounters. But, look at the fiber content of the garments before you choose which product to use.  If they were made in a SE Asian country or have a high synthetic fiber content, do not use Goof off though it works the best.  It often will remove the dyes (vegetable) used by those countries leaving a bleached out spot and can damage synthetic fibers.  Mostenbokers and Carbona both work without doing damage, but you have to place a terry towel underneath, agitate with a soft brush and reapply as the paint breaks down through the fiber.  No instantaneous gratification like with Goof Off.

AA11211317	If I'm not mistaking this is the same bath drain we have at the apartments where I work. You can turn these either direction and at various points the top will stay up then go down.The top will spin on the shaft.When new you pull up.turn left with pressure pulling up and the shaft bottom end will screw out of the drain and you can remove it.As a drain gets corroded the top just spins and the shaft will not screw out of the drain. I use a small 5in. channel lock pliers available at sears. Pull the top up, grab the shaft with the pliers and turn left,counter clockwise. This will remove the drain stopper.A small pair of needle nose pliers will do this as well.Good Luck.|`|iIeMgpBkaa	I believe that the threaded piece needs to unscrew from the large flat piece.  You will need a large slip joint plier or a vise-grip that can hold the thin flat stopper while you use another plier to unscrew the small notched piece.  But there may be another way.  Below your tub spout might be a trip lever and overflow which has a metal plate that is held in by two screws. Remove the screws and the plate then pull the trip lever and the entire linkage out.  This is where your clog is.  Clean it and slide it back in. I realize you have a "step on" stopper, but there may be a linkage.|`|d5GGLl5Uaa	We have the same drain in our tub.

syC3uQpjaa	Walls can have various types of problems, from pin holes and cracks to large break outs, to texture you don't want. Small things such as nail holes can be repaired with spackle, 'Dap 33' oil base window glaze, or tape & joint compound can also be used. Cracks between molding and trim can be filled with paintable caulk. <br>  Most all repair jobs not done with spackle can be done with 'All Purpose Tape and Joint Compound' and 'Topping', both called 'mud', recommending USG or US Gypsum. Mud is usually held in a 'California Cake Pan' or small rectangular box about 4 x 12". Joint paper tape is used for all repairs. Never use mesh, as it is mostly air and will often crack. A roll of tape soaked in water is easiest for amateurs, sticks and flattens better, and is thinner the longer it is soaked. However it is more messy. Mud is applied in a straight line for the length of tape used, with preferably a 9 inch topping blade used for all operations. The tape is pressed into the mud completely flat and the excess is scraped off. This can be allowed to dry or a second coat can be applied immediately, so as to cover the tape. <br>  This coat can be from 6 to 12 inches wide or wider. This then is allowed to dry overnight and usually a third coat of Topping is put over that. Tape can be of any length and should be overlapped about an inch when put together. All Purpose is structural, hard, shrinks and is more difficult to sand. Topping is finish, soft, doesn't shrink as much and is easy to sand, with 120 grit or sponge smooth. Sanding is best under enamel. Sponging raises no dust, but can show messy under enamel, but often good enough under flat latex. <br>  Holes the size of a golf ball and smaller can be backed with some tight fitting plug or glued, something thin like can lid or simply taped over. Any rise caused by the patch can be feathered out with plaster, 12 or more inches all round. A patch is always taped over. Large holes are usually repaired with sheetrock of same thickness as what's there or thinner. For sheetrock walls: with a 'sheetrock saw' cut up and across and down & across to the stud in both directions. Cut down along the stud and remove sheetrock. With a razor-knife cut down at the center of the stud. Cut anew piece and screw to stud both sides. Tape all sides and feather. If there are no studs you can wire patch in. Fit a piece and drill two holes on four sides, one in the patch and one in the wall. Wire in, tape and plaster. For broken plaster over lath: remove loose plaster and cut a piece of sheetrock to the shape of the hole. Screw to lath and or studs. Plaster one does not want to remove can be secured with sheetrock screws and wide thin washers screwed into lath. All cracks are taped. You can also use USG 'Structolite', if you can find it, which can be put in thick. Scrape when dry, tape edges and cover with All Purpose and Topping. Always tape all edges in patching. <br>  Cracks dug out and filled with plaster will crack again eventually. The best way to fix cracks is to cover them with paper sheetrock tape as described in Para 2. When taping curves like curved ceilings, use short pieces a foot to 2 feet long, overlapping a little at ends. Long pieces of tape on the curve will shrink and pull away from the wall. Patches do not need to be primed. Acrylic primer seals add a harder skin. However large areas like sheetrocked whole walls and rooms probably should be primed for toughness and seal to save on finish paint. <br>  Textured, uneven walls, wall paper, plywood, even concrete block (best sealed) can be skim coated over to make smooth. For really deep rents or even making curves, use Structolite, which can fill up to four to 6 inches thick in one coat. Otherwise MSG 'All Purpose' can be applied and holds up pretty thick even up to an inch. Thick coats should be let dry before a second coat, so shrinking is completed. Anytime one removes by scraping ceiling or wall texture, one should first check to make sure it is not asbestos.|`|UQWusO1waa	there is more than one way to this. google your question just as you stated it above. you will see pics on how to do it. better than trying to explain it here.|`|d0d7b35a707f98e4d94fb32cc3b60b5baa	Depends on the size of the hole. For small holes, just use spackling compound in several thin layers. For large holes, you'll need a wooden paint stirrer or similar stick bigger than the hole in the wall. Clean up the edges of the hole with a sheetrock knife, then cut a piece of sheetrock the size of the hole for a plug. Using sheetrock screws, attach the stick across the inside of the hole with one or two screws on each side. Now, attach the plug to the stick using a few more screws. Just tape and spackle over the whole thing as you would any other drywall joint.|`|VOWvshmUaa	Yea, it depends on how big the hole is, these videos might help, if the hole is kinda big, use these <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMfUiAVZ9ZA" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMfUiAVZ9...</a>    <br>  Or if it is a small hole just tape it with joint compound and drywall joint tape.<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHICz13Nf3c" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHICz13Nf...</a> <br>  let me know how it goes. jeff@drywallstuff.com<br>  Jeff Sprow<br>  Drywallstuff.com|`|KHtPan4Jaa	How big is the hole?<br>  If it's small, you can just fill it in with drywall compound.<br>  If it's large, you will need to cut a piece of sheetrock to fit on the hole.

There is an electric resistance heater along the door frame where the seal contacts when the door is closed.  This heater is very helpful in summer because it vaporizes what would be condensation from air moisture.  The condensation provides an unattractive wetness.  To prevent condensation, heaters keep that area warm.    Some refrigerators have an on / off switch for these heaters.  In most winter climates, the heaters are not needed but they will become needed when the outdoor temperatures and dew points rise.
xHOpRlfvaa	Since I have built and install numerous shelf systems and custom shelving over the years, we have had to come up with what works best to prevent the shelves from sagging. For you situation here is what I feel would work best.    Typically a 3/4" thick shelf needs supports about every 3 feet to prevent sagging when you know a lot of weight is going to on the shelf. In your case you would need to use 5/4" material to carry the extra weight and allow you to maintain that type of weight. 5/4 wood is actually 1 1/16" thick and that is why is has a better weight support value then 3/4" wood.    You can get this material from a lumber yard or mill. Some lumber yards will also have mills as a part of their company and they can run the material for you if you can't find it in stock.    Keep in mind that since the shelf is only 6" deep it will have a much better weight load capacity then if it were deeper.     The other thing you can try is to use a 3/4" material, but add a trim strip to the face of the shelf. Usually a piece of 1 x 2 matching wood strip glued and nailed to the face of the shelf and either sanded and rounded off or making a routed edge to give it a finished appearance, will make the shelf more ridged and help support the weight.    In either case, I would recommend using solid wood. Depending on if you are going to paint or stain the wood, you can use, starting with the least expensive, poplar, oak, maple or cherry.    I hope this helps.

Jy15drCtaa	Believe it or not, minor to medium, scratches can be fixed with toothpaste and a little elbow grease.  Clean the glass thoroughly prior to applying the toothpaste. Merely apply the Paste, as it works far better than gel, and rub in a circular motion (with a cotton cloth) over the scratches. Remember, too much removal will result in a slight prism like effect, so take it easy and in small steps. Clean the glass with windex (or like product) and determine if you must have another go.    If your scratch can catch your fingernail, as you scrape it across the scratch, the scratch is too deep to correct in this manner.|`|07402bcc6087c522e1be5f950a5e9ba8aa	For little scratches the first answer is perfect.

You follow the directions and it makes the scratch almost invisible - it is approved for anyplace on the windows except directly in front of the driver so it really does work.

Years ago, it was usually begun after the coal furnace was finished running for the season.  Those old-fashioned furnaces tended to spread sooty residue around the house, so people waited until spring to clean.    Nowadays, to minimize the upheaval, it's more customary to deep-clean one room a week.  Late winter is a good time to get the carpets shampooed, because the humidity is still low enough to help them dry thoroughly and quickly.

Found out when I had to do housework for my mom that furniture polish ends up being greasy and attracts dust like a magnet.|`|07622d05764df8095bb53ff82c523e6daa	If your furniture is laminated then you don't really need polish - a slightly damp rag then dry it would do well.  If it is not laminated then I agree with the others.  I oil mine about once a month with Orange Glo or if it is an especially nice piece I would consult an antique dealer so the wood will not dry out by using the wrong product or nothing at all.  Try to keep really nice pieces out of the sunlight - it really is harmful.|`|l8yfpyy1aa	Some furniture polishes that contain silicone can damage the finish, especially if it's a lacquer or veneer.  My mother's cleaning lady used lots of furniture polish on the lid of our baby grand, which received sunlight during part of the day.  After a while the finish got "crazed".    We never use polish on our own wooden furniture.  Some of it is antique, with a rubbed-oil finish that's not supposed to be shiny anyway.  Some of it is veneered or lacquered as mentioned above.  Some of it has a satin finish that only needs to be dusted.  And the rest of it is so old and crummy that there's no helping it with polish.    My grandmother, who was much more of a meticulous housekeeper than I'll ever be, usually cleaned her wooden furniture with a damp cloth, followed by a dry one.  When I was a little girl, grandma had an English cleaning lady, who told about how she used to have to dust elaborate carved woodwork and furniture with a special dusting brush.|`|6PhSENcXaa	Once a week with furniture polish and if you use the right one it is not greasy.  My wife uses furniture polish every week and nothing is greasy and protects the furniture too.|`|FXnHE7mmaa	I agree with Punk.. I never use furniture polish..waste of money..a damp rag works wonders and I have many antiques that are just fine.|`|4fded85bb017fba5407e3727176079ffaa	Whenever it gets dusty again.  There are no rules for this.
5r2Csdzwaa	You have been reading things written by complete DOLTS! Front loaders use less water, detergent, power and the newer ones can take larger loads. Comforters, coats you name it, the newer models can handle them.<br>  <br>  I usually just act like a jerk on Y/A. Your question provided me the opportunity to give you a serious answer. The front loaders are excellent washers!|`|AA12370001	i have a front loader washer and dryer and they are by far superior to the top loader we used to have.|`|jWtquDVUaa	Hi, don't get me wrong (because I would recommend a front load anytime over a top load) but they have had their problems. Odor in the door boot being one of them, they have been corrected, and as everything when the Government pushes efficiency and every mfg. jumps on the band wagon they have bugs to work out, and unfortunately we are the Guinea pigs. Motor and Machine control boards were another issue and that mfg paid for it. But they do use less water, less detergent (and you do have to use the HE), your clothes will last much longer because you don't have an agitator beating them to death. Where you save is when a front load spins out, they spin at a much higher rpm that they come out almost dry, so less time in the dryer. And you do have to have a good sturdy floor, or they "will" walk and shake, could even bang. But that is going to be true with most washers that spin at the higher speeds. Unless you go up to the much more expensive machines. But as long as the salesperson is not just trying to make the sale, but is informing you before hand of how they work. You will find that you will be happy with no matter what you buy. Sorry to go on, but I work on these things, and the biggest problem is that the customer is not informed. I know that I would be a lot less upset if I was asked if my floor was sturdy. Then to get one home and then have to call for service because the thing just ran down the street with my clothes. And find out that it could have been prevented. <br>   Good luck and make the salsperson sell you on it, not just sell it and get you out the door!|`|QE0U6iPKaa	I am in the UK and 99 percent of our washers are front loaders..I have always wanted the top loaders because you can wash bigger loads. The only one I have seen has to be wired into the electricity because it takes so much power..With the front loaders you can just plug them in. I have never had a problem with the cleaning power of a front loader .|`|65798b01815336774276b167183ee126aa	Look in Search for Questions; front loaders;<br>  People keep asking this question; you will find the answer there.|`|721dc6202a3a978496a32f796da9793caa	I am a big fan of top loaders with an agitator. Front loaders and the top loaders without an agitator like the Calypso types...basicly your HE washing machines have a moldy smell issue...<br>  <a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?ei=utf-8&fr=slv8-hptb5&p=moldy%20smell%20in%20front%20load%20washers&type=">http://search.yahoo.com/search?ei=utf-8&...</a><br>  <br>   bought one of those sets and returned it and got the biggest top loder I could find that had an agitator. I also ended up with a few hundred extra dollars back. Now I can use the less expensive detergents as well and don't have to worry about leaving the door opened or running an empty load with vinegar etc. all the time. I believe when you factor in the extra cost of HE detergent, running empty loads to keep you machine from smelling rancid, and having to use hot water all the time to keep it from smelling, and the much higher price tag of the sets they don't come out so very efficient after all.I see people asking questions on here almost everyday about how to get rid of the moldy smell in their washers. Think about how long you will have your set and ask yourself if you really want to deal with this problem. I want to warn you not to do it ,you could really be sorry.<br>  Here are just a few examples...<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AqvvTLpt2uOscjLrJPNm77nty6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090206182810AAeqrEh">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AlmSNAjzLcWgBkrOW7MD3JLty6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20081130022815AAvXGD8">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AitZrePkIP0QfDYoysAAphrty6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20081117130248AA8MZR8">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=ArTrP0Ewg90eQPrs9KKDZtfty6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20081108201806AAxla4U">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AqI8oE2ML8k4pMCtPgYc6gnty6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20080914200612AAYXxtG">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AhbCKcSKiqJ2O8tftRI.Ybvty6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20080907095901AAZJV8p">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AqvvTLpt2uOscjLrJPNm77nty6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20080907084839AAyLY0H">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Aqq89BfAtftyzPeKwOi6h2Dty6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20080907113732AAkvoWD">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=At_pjInNG0NFi.TAQm1NWhvty6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20080718113529AAwHUrB">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <br>  What kills me is the people who will say "yeah my front loader smells like mold but I still recommend one". Do people really think they look better to the point where they are willing to have stinky clothes for it? And I have heard people say "they clean better." In my opinion they don't use enough water to clean well. It is true that you can get some pretty large ones that will do a larger load than a top loader with an agitator. But I bought a very large top loader and my king size comforter fits in and that's good enough for me. My neighbors clothes always smell like mildew but I tell everyone"Don't do it" and they will do it anyway ( I told them not to as well).Then I sit and watch it happen. My advice when it comes to front loaders is to steer clear. I know it's the cool new fashionable thing to buy the front loaders but...Be smart. DON'T DO IT! Don't think it's because people are leaving their clothes in the washers till they smell. That's not what is happening or you'd have heard the same number of complaints about top loaders.<br>  I answer these questions a lot and am never very popular with the front loader lovers for it but I still do it anyway in the hopes of saving someone years of laundry torture. I absolutely hated mine and am so so happy to be rid of them. If they ever try to phase out the old schooll ones, like they're doing with everything else like light bulbs etc... I will buy a set and store it in my garage for the day I need a new set. That's just how badly I hated mine! I also think that many of these people standing up for their front loaders haven't had them long enough to start having the problems and will sooner or later be hating theirs too. Right now their infatuated with the look of them. The honeymoon will fade.|`|s2F6pK9Xaa	I have one. It's the first I've ever used 'cause I grew up with only a top-loader. I love my front-loader though and wouldn't go back. It does use less water, and when the cycle is done the clothes are practically dry already! So it really cut our drying time down drastically too!<br>  <br>  Front-load is the way to go. seriously.|`|DsMonxcdaa	I have had one (Kitchen-Aid) for 4.5 years and I love it.  You should leave the washer door open or wipe it out/dry at the end of the day.

Lsl4Jhzgaa	There are 3 main companies doing this type of remodel. Make sure you  get quotes from at least two (2) so you can make the best and most informed decision.  1) Luxury Bath  2) Re-Bath  3) Bath Fitter    Luxury Bath has the best material in the industry. It also has a product called microban. Acrylic is a non-porous surface, requiring less maintenance than many other available surfaces. Microban is built-in to Luxury Bath liners to provide an added level of cleanliness. Microban inhibits the growth of microorganisms, such as bacteria, mold and mildew that can cause stains and odors on the surface of your tub. The continuous antimicrobial cleaning action of Microban makes you Luxury Bath tub liner easier to clean and keeps it cleaner between cleanings. The antimicrobial additive used in Luxury Bath tubs is registered by the EPA for use in many products including acrylic tubs and walls, sinks, and bath accessories. Luxury Bath also has a no nonsense Lifetime Warranty. www.luxurybath.com    Re-Bath would be my second choice. The reason being is they, like Luxury Bath have a one piece "dog leg" (The dog leg goes from the top of the tub rail to the floor in front of the tub.)    The reason I would not recommend Bath fitter is because of the dog leg. (Click link for a picture of their dog leg http://www.flickr.com/photos/bathfitter/  )This is a area that is prone to leaking and they piece it together here.    Also see these links   http://www.consumeraffairs.com/homeowner...  http://bath-fitter.pissedconsumer.com/    As far as other options there is    1) tearing it out and starting over  2) Ceramic tile  3) re-glazing    With tearing it out you will be forced to use a fiberglass tub, which is very porous making it very difficult to clean. (for those that are reading this, thinking how nice your fiberglass tub is, go in there and rub your fingers over it. It may look o.k. but it will be greasy, thats because the porous material is literally sucking the soap scum in.  Fiberglass surrounds are also known for cracking and being "spongy" when you stand in them.    Ceramic tile is definitely attractive, but unfortunately the grout is the weak point, after all its 80% sand, and sand sucks in the water making it a perfect surface for mold and mildew. Grout also needs maintenance once a month, but before you do the maintenance, you need to clean it with a toothbrush.    re-glazing is when they paint the tub. This is more of a band-aid if your trying to sell the home, but dont care how it will look in 6 months to 1 year. It also doesn't address the walls or fixtures.|`|07622d05764df8095bb53ff82c523e6daa	If you are asking for recommendations then you need to let everyone know what city, state you are in.  Other than that ask your friends and co workers who they know of.|`|PRx6j6YQaa	we had the tub and and three walls plus a shower door installed four years ago and we were satisfied they way the job came out and still satisfied now|`|3yzpx3HSaa	Keep in mind when looking for someone to remodel that bathrooms and kitchen are the worst rooms to do .You want to make sure that they have had a few years experience at them and to ask for reference there are many things that they can do wrong that could cost you dig
N4u9DRvFaa	I used rags and would just wash them. Got better results. I was doing multi color wiring diagrams and erasers would be mess before long. The soap and water should be OK too. Let them air dry. I also found that the store bought white boards would get funky from cleaners used on them too. Being handy I began to make my own out of the 4' X 8' sheets made for shower walls. They had a surface that was more durable and only cost $30.00. I did have to put them up myself and build a tray, but they stayed slick and clean.    Good Luck|`|72ef78c3205dba97ba85c7ff5642145baa	WOW!  I have one of each for the dry erasers.  One is a smooth one and one that is fuzzy.  The smooth one I simply wipe off with a damp paper towel and a bit of alcohol.  On the fuzzy one, I simply wash off in the sink with dish soap and water and set on a couple of paper towels or an old clean rag.  I refilled my expensive spray cleaner for the dry erase boards with half alcohol and half water, work really good.  Most of the time I don't even use the erasers and have resorted to using a paper towel dampened with this mixture.  Works great and keeps the boards all like brand new!  Hope this helps you!  Good luck!|`|AA11945637	dish detergent and water, they clean well!|`|cKgJBhDIaa	All the ones I have used, you can peel off the layer and there will be a new one underneath.|`|4sGAxGPVaa	take the marker and wright on your white board until the marker is clean
mP0LLMVjaa	You can scrub it with an ammonia based cleaner or just mix some lemon ammonia and water(25/75)in a spray bottle. Use white vinegar for the water spots. After you get it all clean go to Home Depot and buy some GEL-GLOSS next to tubs and sinks. You apply like car wax and buff it out. This will help protect the corian and also clean and polish it.

ECTwMoHaaa	I usually take about 10-15 minutes.<br>  You could save water while you are showering by shutting the water off when you are shampooing your hair.  Turn the water back on to wash out the shampoo, then do the same thing while you condition your hair, shut the water off.  You could do that too while you wash your body.  I do that sometimes.  You will be using less water then.|`|0F8hauikaa	I take 5-10 minutes because I don't like to waste water. If I need longer I take a bath. Sorry, but I would have to agree with your folks on this one because that's a lot of water going down the drain. Also if you're taking hot showers, inhaling too much steam can be harmful because the minerals can deposit in your lungs.<br>  <br>  add.. I have long hair too, but I turn off the water while I'm lathering and conditioning. You'll understand someday when you have to pay the bills yourself.|`|vO9fPCm2aa	LOL I understand believe me I do but it is really too long. They do have water restricters that can be used on your shower-head and will save lots of water from being wasted. Any hardware store sells them. Water needs to be conserved, there are many places in the US having trouble these days with water levels going below normal.  There are many factors that cause this, lack of rain or over building in an area. Also depending on where you live the cost is high. If you have to shave why not fill the bathroom sink, half way will do and shave before you go in the shower? :~)|`|MQJ8w56Qaa	I believe that conserving water is important to future generations so I take 3 mins or less.<br>  20 mins is excessive if you think about the millions of people in this country who survive, barely, on a few gallons a day.<br>  One day, very soon, I expect that everywhere in the US will impose water rationing.|`|e67e5dfc74c396a718533bd7b4a5f8fbaa	depends who im in there with, no seriously i would think 20 mins is average really, depends if you have to shave any bits in there too, but i would say 20-30 mins so you are normal.|`|ClRuPRs7aa	I agree with "<3 Simple Plan". <br>  I take 20-25 minutes. I think that's normal esp. for people with long hair or if you're colouring it etc. Even the guys in my family take at least 20 minutes to shower.|`|X3eafAdAaa	First off just wondering how old you are. And the people who answered too actually. 3 mins for a shower? Do you people shave? As for the asker I think 20 mins is perfectly reasonable especially if you're a girl seeing as our hair is generally kinda long and we tend to shave and stuff. I take about that long too. As do my sisters. My younger ones take about 30 or even 40 mins. Water is recycled so it really doesn't matter that some people take 3 minute showers and some take longer. Why would there be a water limit or whatever it was someone said? The earth is 80 percent water. I don't think it's gonna run out soon.|`|5Y9Ekm0naa	I agree with simple plan. There's no way I could take a shower in 10 minutes. I'm not average though, I take like 45-60min in the shower lol.... I run out of hot water on every single shower I take. <br>  <br>  The reason I take so long is because I have to wash my body, then wash my face w/ a separate face wash, then shampoo my hair & rinse it out, then condition my hair & rinse it out (rinsing takes awhile, especially if we have a lot of thick long hair!), and then finally the most time consuming thing of all...... SHAVE.... I hate it! I swear if I could afford laser hair removal, I would do it! Shaving takes soooo much time out of my mornings. And we have to do it AT LEAST every other day to stay smooth. <br>  <br>  If it weren't for shaving, I could prolly take a shower in 20 minutes.|`|rAtO08x5aa	yeah.. 20minuites is crazy.. you're folks are right.. you have to be either one of these three things for you not to be crazy<br>  1. you weigh over 400lbs<br>  2. you probably related to monk<br>  3. you get free water from the state<br>  If you can answer yes to any of these questions t hen 20 min is ok. If you can't then sad to say.. You're crazy|`|IvBS6A3saa	I take about 20 minutes, but I have long hair which I need to wash and condition.

They "tried to work around it" but still squashed a bunch of flowers with their auger machine.

Use of the minimum amount of TP, no girl stuff, and no food waste, peelings, garbage disposal stuff, all that will lead to trouble.  The bacteria in a septic system that develop from our waste is quite capable of turning most things into liquid,  the overflo of which is then funnelled into a dry well.     Plumber Guy is probably right about the roots, or I've found pipes that were cracked and shifted sideways and up or down from one another to cause a problem spot.  You need someone with a camera snake to find the trouble.|`|fGXHrD3xaa	You probably have roots or a spur in the pipe catching solids.Call a plumber with a camera to scope the pipes to see the problem.You never need to put anything in your septic as long as you are using your toilets that's enough.
8apA3Rffaa	Ok all I ll answer is the tile.. Your best way to do it is to be directly onto the slab. you can treat the raised edge w/ tile (nail cement board on the raised edge ) Unless you put a heated wired flooring system in there isn t much you can do now..But putting a tile landing there is a real good idea for boots and shoes etc...  You can t put 1" sleepers down and durock, , the cement and tile needs more support than that to meet tile codes.    You carpeted subfloor , you should do 3/4 t &g flooring   Any flooring questions your welcome to e mail me thru my avatar ..  GL|`|1nbYdXE0aa	Why are you thinking about sleepers,subfloor,plywood?  Just seal the concrete good and roll out your carpet & Pad. If it is a walkout basement you surely won't have any water problems ?  Don't complicate this project by over engineering it.  Relax, just do what needs to be done - it will be much easier on your wallet and a lot more practical.   It will be fine !

You could have:    Blue  light purple  Yellow  Pale orange|`|DKJ8sjxVaa	Hmmm... I'm a fan of kind of monochromatic bedrooms (super calming) so here's what I'd do:     Pick a nice, deep color- a royal/navy blue, dark rusty orange... even a nice dark grey would be nice...   Then I'd find a bedspread with... probably a geometric pattern, to echo the headboard, with the same color in it **but lighter! With dark furniture you can do dark/ dramatic on the walls, but the accessories should all be lighter!     Also, with a dark room like that, I'd make sure all of the trim is brilliant white- it looks so nice against dark walls! Maybe with white wood blinds, and panels that match/ echo the bedspread?    Hope that helps- good luck!|`|rSH8pQI5aa	I would go with a touch of vibrant colors like orange, red, royal blue and add those in throw pillows for bed, single flower in vase of bold color.

Primary red would look amazing though!  Use this in wall art, curtains, bedding, lamp shades.  It will look amazing!|`|iZS3ydHEaa	Well with those wood colors I would stick with a dark color, maybe a dark red. Or even olive greens.|`|kEMg7hMLaa	I would go with something bold and colorful a few varying shades of a deep gold, in a faux plaster treatment.
V44ARW4maa	it helps a little, but sheetrock would be a better choice and cheaper to install. Or soundboard, which is designed specifically for situations such as you describe. Check with a contractor for the best solution to your problem and if you have saved any correspondence with the landlord/manager, then deduct the cost you incur from your rent. Should you still be required to pay your full rent, sue in small claims court for your cost--which you had to make because the manager/landlord refused to correct the problem. Good luck.|`|21fee98831946197f4886f287f0a38c1aa	Where I used to work we put up Cork Board 1" thick on the entire wall to help with the noise next door.|`|JoAfcy4Caa	yeh i believe it would|`|6OHgjWwsaa	no cement board is used to give you a cement like area to put tile on to, you need something that will absorb sound like foam pads in the wall, but i dont think you landlord will go for it     Good luck|`|09zVUMBRaa	I believe so.  My mom has a "townhouse" that has a fire wall made of cinder block which is the shared wall for 2 units & we don't hear a thing.  Of course, her neighbor is elderly and doesn't throw head banger parties.|`|apvPWgNzaa	Cement board will have little or no effect. Try some type of insulation or acoustical tile.  Check with your local building supply.  They will tell you what to use.
AA10097817	They don't get very hot. They are meant to just keep you warm, not heat up the bed.|`|DMhAPurkaa	Take it back.  I have one.   Had electric blankets since i was a kid.   When I was sick, my mom would make me get in the electric blanket and turn it up to 8 or 9, and sweat it out.  We have one that has dual controls and my husband can t stand it past 2 or 3 setting. I usually have my side on 5 to 8. We live where there is snow and it is very cold to me. But I am a cold blooded person naturally.  8 or 9 should make you sweat so that you can t even stand it.   5 is very roasty.  However, you must have layer your blankets.  Have a thin one under the electric blanket, and mmost important, have one or two thin ones or one big comforter on TOP of the electric blanket because if you don t , the heat will rise right up and dissipate into your room. You want to CAPTURE and keep the heat in your bed, so be sure to put a blanket on top of the electric one, and at least a sheet Underneath, so it doesn t burn you if you fall asleep with it on too high.   It should be heated up within 5 minutes.  After one hour, your body heat should be up so that you need to turn the blanket down. If you re not warm following these tips, take it back!   Manufacturer s defect, could have a short in the cord, dangerous! Could start a fire.  Also check your cords, make sure they are all plugged in and not bent, or tangled in some way to make sure the current can flow through.  good luck and don t settle for less than happy!|`|4z0Rk4Ddaa	Your electric blanket is defective.  Take it back.  It should get warm or hot enough where it should not burn you.

This appliance CANNOT be safely wired to a lighting circuit.  Think ! the biggest light bulb you would put in is 100W - and this heater is nearly ten times that.  You would blow the whole lighting circuit and have to call an electrician out to fix it.  You want that?    It does have to be wired into the 13A mains circuit.  Best practice is to site it as far from the bath, shower and basin as possible and wire it into its own socket.  You must not be able to have one hand in water while you touch the heater.      I did the next best thing.  I fixed the heater to the wall and took the cable out of the bathroom to the nearest socket, some 3 ft away on the landing.  It's not perfect, and the cable is pegged to the skirting board, but it does the job.|`|AA11366224	No you can't wire it to the light.  It needs to be on a 13amp fused spur on your ring main with the switch outside of the bathroom.  Get your electrician to do it before you blow yourself up.|`|r1fb8t25aa	no, better with its own supply|`|c67a2f77ab7471bed4b2f279ff05e2e1aa	DIY electrical fitting can so easily be fatal that you'd be mad to try doing it yourself. Also, it would probably invalidate the terms of your lease or your house insurance, or both.   It may even be against the law, or local byelaws.  Do you want to die ?|`|e9f5dcec520cd586cd97f18b437a1c4baa	Not on lighting:  It needs a 5A fused spur, so needs to be on the socket circuit. It should have a RCD in there somewhere    If it were being fitted in a bathroom it would have to be more than 600mm from the 'tub' bit of the bath or shower tray.|`|07a647b6a4d7e292eacb07b50a5536b1aa	On a fused & switched spur off ring main.    "Glen C " is probably in USA     " Tertia "    disregard, it is not permitted.|`|dG57cG5Raa	always remember green to brown, red to black, blue to bits

V9HNzXFuaa	when the temp falls one to two degrees below the setpoint the heat should come on|`|krIP1mrxaa	Just turn the heat up and press the hold or setting button on the device.  I used to have that same model, maybe an older one though.    best answer please! :)

The tree is on your property, if he cuts it down, or even comes on your property with the intent of cutting it down,  have him arrested for criminal trespass and sue him for replacement value of the tree, court cost and punitive damages. That could run into thousands of dollars, large trees are very expensive.|`|xeC5iCBYaa	if the trees in your yard he cant just come cut it down! hes headed for a lawsuit|`|CanuQYj5aa	put a fence up so you can keep him out. if you have to you can call the police on him for destruction of property and trespassing. pay back is a bad reason to kill a living thing(i hate how ppl think if it isn't a person it doesn't madder).|`|CEhfxyzeaa	no|`|3DZBtYKpaa	You are funny.|`|WQfAiA4haa	may|`|t1NTGuIZaa	no, and the larger, more mature the tree is, the more money it's worth.  btw, keep it in your pants from now on to avoid this in the future.  good luck
