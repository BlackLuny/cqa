bAYVSfdJaa	Doesn't hurt too bad - not any worse than any other tattoo.  And it's really quick - mine only took like 10 minutes and he was done.     The healing process is easy.  Just brush your teeth regularly & gargle with non alcoholic mouth wash.  Avoid alcohol and dairy for a few weeks, and you'll be fine.     Oh and don't be surprised if when you're brushing your teeth, you get ink on the tooth brush.|`|EE8hw8Agaa	Haha my friend and i both got "egg-roll" tattooed inside our lips(inside joke) anyway it didn't hurt or take very long,but the tattoos are not guaranteed to last very long and most tattoo artists will not re do it if the ink falls out,mine is still visible after 6months while hers is completely gone.|`|9jKfeIUgaa	my cousin got one and it was fairly tiny,  it was a heart, his girlfriend also got the same exact thing in the same place. it didn't hurt her at all, and he thought it hurt so much he actually started tearing up.    honestly you can't really judge how much it will hurt, it's more how you take pain.|`|FNuFVH2Eaa	why would you want one there?|`|jeqpSdtkaa	I got mine done 6 months ago. I've NEVER had it touched up. and it still looks great.    here's what you do:  no smoking for the next few days. it'll cause bleeding of the ink. which results with fading. your mouth heals really fast. so maybe two or three days.  keep it dry! keep a paper towel behind your lip to keep the wet off of it. and when it gets damp or wet. change it. keep doing that for the next two or three days too.    I recommend the tattoo though. it's not painful at all. it took about 10 minutes. and they're really fun when you're showing them off.    I got GET MONEY on mine.  :]
7NJufRlGaa	Freckles are a sign of skin damage.Meaning that you have been exposing yourself too much to the sun.If you have sensitive skin they will keep appearing but the more you take care of your skin with sunblock and things like that the less they will appear or wont get as dark.|`|649c429ab4a34c033914538239c6e27aaa	I've been there.  It's natural (hard to believe).   Are you fair skinned?  Does you hair have some red in it?  Ask your parents if this runs in your family.  Good news is that they will disappear--eventually.  One day you will wake up and they will be gone.  Just remind yourself that you are very special and that they will eventually disappear.|`|ox7mJ2Psaa	it's hereditary your parents or grand parents have freckles so stay out of the sun or accept your freckled fate and enjoy the sun. your choice.|`|ouyIs2UWaa	oh my gosh haha,i dont know.  but freckles are pretty (:
hd7J2aoNaa	you can eat more  [Pro-Sarcasm?]|`|m7Y10ojiaa	Eating cookies.|`|NcnIugdoaa	Eat fatty foods high in carbohydrates like pasta, potatoes, meat, and dairy. Be warned though, genetics determine where you will gain weight, everybody gains weight in their buttocks, but some more frequently. If you eat badly to gain weight it could appear anywhere on your body.     And you have to do some exercise shape it by altering the appearance of the muscles in your butt and those around it, exercise will build muscles. So you'll get bigger musuclar butt instead of a "fatty" one.     Placing the barbell behind your back and on your shoulders with your hands holding the weight parallel to your neck.   Making certain that the weight is comfortably balanced.   Next, bending your legs at the knees and hips, lowering your torso between your legs, and then reversing direction to stand up straight again.   Repeat this for 6-10 repetitions and do 2-3 sets of it|`|OapXbjbSaa	ya annal sex
2RkDecZwaa	anywhere from 50-80 dollars.|`|toPAXum8aa	like 40 buckss|`|YzXPqHd7aa	$40-$50|`|lGdrPJLpaa	it depends on the tattoo shop and the hours it takes i have one on my side thats 2 1/2 and 5 1/2 in on my side its colored and detailed and it was $120. i have a stars on my side just the outline they are all 2 by 2 those were $60. most places start of at $60 and go up from there. the best advice is just go to local tattoo shops see how they function and ask how much they will charge.|`|EE8hw8Agaa	Probably shop minimum,about $80 in NY
ADkusTVXaa	Here's an idea:      1. Take a warm/cold shower and scrub your hair with shampoo and conditioner. (I recommend tresseme shampoo and conditioner)    2. After your shampoo and conditioner is all washed out, fresh and clean, plug in the hair dryer and flat iron.    3. Brush your hair thoroughly and dry your hair until it's flat.    4. If your hair is straight enough, no need to straighten it.    5. If your hair still has wave, flat iron your hair as straight as possible.    6. Lean over and flip your hair over your head so your eyes and hair are facing towards the floor.    7. Scoop up your hair into "pony tail" form and start to wrap the elastic around your "ponytail" as if you were doing a normal up-do.    8. Instead of fully wrapping the elastic around, when it is almost as tight as it can get, put your hair into a careless messy bun in the mid-section of your head.    9. Over wrap elastic with a scrunchy and overlap the scrunchy with a black ribbon.    10. Mess up your hair a LITTLE BIT to make it kind of a "just-woke-up" look.    11. If bobby pins are needed in some areas, put them in loose.    12. Put some bangs to the side but not enough to call them "side bangs".    13. Optional: Add the tiniest amount of hair spray on the bun and around your head but not to much to where it gets ruined. Enjoy!|`|sHf6pbpqaa	Dye it or straighten or curl it   I would suggest cutting it a little shorter, so it's choppy  and bangs?    http://www.short-hair-style.com/images/r...  like this, but with slightly longer bangs  :]
ovDqPtg8aa	no, not at all. juat a little pinch like feeling for a few seconds, then its fine!  just the noice scared me.. haha|`|EJL5QoDraa	no it doesnt u cant even feel it|`|xgsZ083Yaa	no it doesn't hurt at all!!!  I got mine when I was 8 years old, and i was literally crying before i got it done because i thought it was gonna hurt so bad. and then after i was like...."wow, i was crying about this?". you will be fine.  and if you can't remember if it hurt or not.....chances are it didnt hurt. haha|`|c0XomxxEaa	It wont hurt haha, itll hurt more if your worried and het up about it, cos youll sort of be expecting to get some pain.. so your body will set up for it..|`|ZMVs9bGxaa	it hurts a little but,  it feels kindof like a small bee sting but its quick|`|mL64wlQ4aa	no  but everyones different, my mum passed out from having her ears pierced lol ;S|`|u31B8Ycjaa	not rly.  the noise you hear scares me more.|`|RJG7XpGdaa	nah, it barely hurt fer me :3|`|NOz2NIMTaa	Not really, it's like getting a shot, the pain doesn't even last a second.|`|uR5aNpHGaa	i dont think it hurts  its like a quick pinch  itll hurt for the second they do it but then its totally fine|`|TWW5DGttaa	No, You will feel it but it won't be bad, it will definitely be worth it. But if you psych yourself out like this you are gonna wish you hadn't been so scared if it makes you back out of it or it could just waste a lot of energy.|`|pnHkFv5iaa	I would imagine not. Although I don't remember it, when I was three, my mom took me to get my ears pierced. She told me to be a big girl and not cry. So she took me and the lady pierced them and my mom payed for it. I kept a straight face and the second I walked outside I let out a huge wail and was balling all the way home.    So if I could keep a straight face until I got out the door, I'd imagine it's just the alarm of having your ears pierced more than the actual piercing.|`|nOtGVyTVaa	not at all i got mine in 3rd grade and i felt like a little pinch, and i thought that she was just feeling my ear lobe or something, but then she said she was done, what hurts is cleaning them having to twist the earrings, but its worth it.    good luck|`|sHf6pbpqaa	Nooo haha  it's a little pain for about ten seconds  then a minute later its fine!|`|rt4OnxkYaa	everyone is different but i have 8 ear piercings.... people just freak themselves out... you'll be fine its less painful than a bee sting|`|h6sxREeWaa	nah it doesnt hurt  i actually like the feeling  well not the feeling   itself but the feeling of  relief and satisfaction  after its done =]]|`|Q8Sv4V48aa	Are you getting your lobe pierced? When I got mine pierced I couldn't even feel it. I was nervous cause I was expecting it to hurt, but I couldn't feel it. It stings a little afterwards, but not that bad.|`|Pf6E6aFQaa	No I got my ears pierced when I was young and it didn't even bother me. Its like getting a quick shot at the doctors but not half as bad!|`|jBeBIGYqaa	Im going to be honest with you here.  It doesnt hurt but for a couple of minutes.  However, you CAN hear the cartilage ripping, in some cases.   but I love my earrings to death.  I got my first ones when I was in kindergarten so im sure you can handle it :)  just try not to think about it and it will be a-ok! :)|`|Gx6VYjMhaa	DONT GO TO THE MALL AND GET IT DONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    THAT'S THE ABSOLUTE WORST PLACE TO GET IT DONE AT. GO TO A PROFESSIONAL BODY PIERCING/TATTOO PARLOR. THEY'RE TRAINED AND THEY DONT USE THE PLASTIC GUNS WHICH CAUSE BLUNT FORCE TRAUMA. EVERY TIME THE PLASTIC GUNS WERE USED ON MY EARS, THEY BECAME INFECTED AND STARTED PUSSING.|`|ZSEBueCbaa	Nahh, it really doesn't hurt that much. Ignore the first answer, it will just make you freak out!   You will be fine, its really not that bad.
7aEYC0CPaa	i like your color it works for your complexion|`|Wu5q79tgaa	I think you should cut it and get layers then get a darker or black underneath|`|fEcNMm05aa	I like your hair.  Strawberry Blonde is hard to do right.   && it depends how far you want the "strawberry" to come into play.  I have strawberry blonde hair and my hair has a lot of red in it.  I think you should lean with a blonder strawberry blonde.    It does work well with your complexion.|`|vFccfrzLaa	Considering you look pretty young and your hair healthy, I'd leave it alone. You already have some natural highlight in it which in my opinion is better than any bottle color. Embrace your natural beauty...as you get older you'll see that men like that.

HusPtzz9aa	Neutrogend Skin iD had different versions of the kits since they customize each cleanser and pad for you. So, if you have different numbers that you recieved after the evaluation test, then your results might be a bit different.    I have a medium amount of acne, and the numbers I got were 7, 32, and 38. I feel like this kit wasn't really worth every penny of $40, but it'll be nice to try.    The kit calmed down my pimples and I had a bit less, but I still had blackheads and some dry skin areas.    I suggest you try Skin iD if you don't have servere acne. Good luck!

4w361g8Laa	Did you look at Locks of Love? They're the only organization that takes hair donations I think. I haven't heard of a salon that doesn't do it. You need a minimum of 10" to donate. Just call a salon and ask if they donate to them. Usually they'll do the cut for free if you donate. They just cut off the 10" (or however much you want to donate) and then they send it off for you. You probably see a lot about women donating hair because not a lot of men have hair that long or if they do, they don't want to donate it. They have all the info on their website. www.locksoflove.org.|`|iHC5mSLEaa	go to your doctor and ask him/her
IxD8aNHTaa	plain white defiantly. The stripes wouldn't match.|`|IB2V5t1Oaa	Wear the red and blue one. Black/white is boring.
4EZis4lWaa	I wouldn't trust anything online.  usually they are not made very well or made with metals that will irritate your skin.  check out a tattoo and/or piercing shop near where you live (many tattoo shops also sell body jewelry/studs).  they can answer your questions and make recommendations.|`|TDtSZLmvaa	uhm try bodycandy.com they have almost evrything.<br>  if not try the nearest piercing pagoda.<br>  <br>  =]]
YJV2TU6taa	Well yes and no. You could get all your skin tattooed but certain parts of skin do not hold color well(like the soles of your feet). So it would look far from natural.|`|Ez7aguFgaa	It might be possible, but you would have to invest a lot of money into it for it to look nice.<br>  <br>  But if it's not, then you could tan to get your skin that dark shade. It might not look as perfect, but it's a possibility.<br>  <br>  Also, what color are you to begin with?|`|TDtSZLmvaa	its most likely possible... but... it would cost like mega dollars!!!|`|SflneyGEaa	soooo, you're looking to tattoo all of your skin, not with pictures, just ink, so you can be.... an african american? well... I'm not to sure tattoos have gone in that direction yet. I don't even know if they make that color of ink. My suggestion... ask a tattoo artist. But I'm guessing it's a no.|`|5XYlHv6Paa	DO it, it would only cost $25,000 and they would have to do it in like 30 sessions at least, so you would be different colors, then other aread would fade. I say go for it!|`|5dcARi8Daa	Elphaba you dumbass he's already african american he wants to be lighter. Youre so ignorant elphaba|`|UkGhdEXnaa	There are some places on your body that can't be tattooed... or that would be extremely painful to get tattooed, anyway.

bBXBvGnLaa	If you've changed the bar make sure you put either your origional bar, or a differant one back in. but it has to be a proper silver or gold not a cheapy nasty one from somewhre like claires, cos a cheap nasty one will get infected for starters.

Use some patroleum jelly to keep it hydrated. All piercings heal differently, so don't worry about it. But don't pick any scabs ever.... you're just asking for it to scar if you do.
6kVgsUveaa	Love it.<br>  I usually take every Summer off work only because Im<br>  a total beach bum.  Never a day without being on the beach.<br>  Agree with the positive effects on health, lifts depression, se-f esteem & self-image improves, assists with any muscular ailments/reumatism in the joints, my glowing skin seems to grow on others. Yep<br>  Im addicted, but who wouldnt want to be warm/fuzzy & happy most of the time eh?|`|ojceQQ1Paa	I hate tanning.  A tan (if it's not natural) is not healthy.  It's the body's defense mechanism against sun damage and will age you faster and cause premature wrinkling.  It's not worth it.  Not to mention it dramatically increases your chances of getting skin cancer.<br>  <br>  I have never tanned, I always use sunscreen.  I am a married woman in my 30's, but I constantly get mistaken for being a teenager.  I credit it to the fact I take very good care of my skin and protect against sun damage.  Plus I have black hair and blue eyes.  So being as pale as I am, gives me an exotic look (or so people tell me).|`|6SxVuHjNaa	i like tanning and i am tan|`|ABOvm38Caa	I know having a tan definitely makes me feel better.  I used to go tanning all the time, but actually glad I stopped.  It really does do so much damage to your skin.  I am a woman in my 30's and I still look pretty young and would like to keep it that way.  I use self tanners now and I love them.  They make you look like you have a healthy glow and keep your skin moisturized as well.And although tanning does help with acne for a brief time it eventually does come back I've learned.  I guess to each his own.|`|5XYlHv6Paa	It has cleared my terrible acne like nothing else, it makes me feel happier. I want to go right now but I have an addiction! If I go once, I want to go every day.|`|vWRk0gViaa	I love tanning. I like how I look in the summer|`|3w7VztEWaa	Yes!!! but I can't tan..<br>  I'm 5 almost 6 months pregnant...so I'm very white..<br>  once I have my baby and get my body back i'm going to be hitting it up at the tanning salon. haha|`|uQO1Lx9Iaa	tanning gives you cancer.....you shouldnt do it too much....its very bad for you
47f68597748b8362993a581aa0e99a14aa	Poor diet & stress can wreck havoc on your tresses.|`|fMPyLqW4aa	You might want to go to a salon and get some special shampoo/conditioner.|`|5sCpMpbWaa	yeah i have the same type of hair. ask your hair dressers for sort layers and ask s/he to thin it out well!|`|s63bm0Guaa	Hi there, sounds to me like an over active sebaceous gland issue. <br>  whats happening is your probably over washing your hair with something to harsh for your scalp, so it strips out all of your natural oils, which you need. and then your oil glands are working double time to replenish what you just stripped out, so your ending up w/really oily hair. <br>  I suggest going to a salon that sells Paul Mitchell, and pick yourself up a bottle of Paul Mitchell Shampoo two. Its especially for oily hair.<br>  As for the frizz issue, if that's an issue now, DON'T get your hair thinned, it WILL make that problem even worse!  i recommend doing a deep conditioning treatment once a week. ask your stylist to book you in for one when you go in for your haircut.  Then follow up with that at home on your own. ask your particular stylist what deep conditioner is best for you.<br>  also grab a smoothing serum while you are there, something like biosilk silk therapy, or Smooth and Seal by sexy hair(a spray version)|`|eD51aBzlaa	<a href="http://www.suave.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.suave.com/</a><br>  <br>  <br>  go to products. and hit professional. <br>  and its in the orange bottle sleek. its the best, i had the same problem with my hair and now i have no problems at all.<br>  <br>  it smooths and moisterizes dry and frizzy hair. its awesome. lol.
XeASdibHaa	It would definitely work. You have a long forehead (which is good =) ) so bangs would look very nice. You both have the same face shape so it would definitely work. Go for it! <br>  <br>  :)|`|OT7t6pyyaa	Yes I think you could! I think the bangs would look nice. It looks like you have pretty straight hair so you will have to curl it or put rollers in it to get the whole look but i like it.|`|DV39yHz4aa	Yeah that would look really pretty!! You should really try that!|`|AA10695177	YEAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH|`|8QEdP8aCaa	Sure. You have a pretty long forehead so bangs would definitely help to break the length up. A layered look framing your face would also probably look nice.|`|ZvOXs61caa	totaly. deff. go for it! you are so gorgeous! go for modeling! <33|`|qkLqlW4Caa	aw sweety... i like you would be really cute with this hair style too... <br>  <a href="http://www.super-hair.net/atisdale5.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.super-hair.net/atisdale5.jpg</a> and the other one is cute to but keep the brown! your so purdy. i love you kaylee|`|K4bJgTF4aa	go for it chic! it would look great.

z74wSbQoaa	It's very cheap and you'll find it in a bottle near rubbing alcohol and peroxide.  I've never used it for blemishes, but I have on bug bites and it relieves the itch/irritation.|`|SsLY7ehhaa	It is very effective as I currently suffer badly from spots but be careful as it is rather strong stuff. It can sting a bit especially on sore spots, best to wait til they are starting to heal a bit before applying. Other than that, yeah go for it. Another thing I suggest you try is the T-Zone clear up spot dots, they are cheap if you get them from Home Bargains (don't know if there is one near you) or maybe if they are in Wilkos or something. They are the best thing I have ever used, you put them on overnight and take them off in the morning. They are clear patches and as the stuff works overnight as you sleep, the next morning the spots are reduced and less red. Work instantly and may only take 1-2 application depending upon how bad the blemishes or spots are. There are 20 patches, just apply them to each spot or blemish.<br>  <br>  Good luck with it, if you need any more help just e-mail me.

2LDGlA1Paa	How employ-able do you want to be?  I understand that tattoo's are very "in" these days, but they may not always be.<br>  <br>  There will always be employers who; when faced with choosing between two equally qualified candidates; will choose the one that they feel best presents themselves as being "professional"<br>  <br>  Would you be willing to consider getting your cross tattoo on an area of your body that wouldn't be exposed when wearing normal business attire? That may be a way to compromise on what you want vs. what a potential future employer expects in the way of professionalism.|`|rFMRgHTdaa	Personally i wouldn't mind if you were my doctor and had tattoo's other people feel different, plus you can always wear long sleeves to interviews and stuff like that.|`|AA12032352	Any visible tattoo lowers your employablity......do you plan to always wear long sleeves or a white coat while working? If not I'd think of a different location.|`|TDtSZLmvaa	noo it will not hurt your chances... everytime i am in a hospital i see doctors and nurses showing their tattoos. so i doubt it would be a problem around where you live as well.<br>  <br>  =]]|`|VcfxzfH9aa	If your tattoo is covered no one has to know. There people with visble tattooes that work in fast food,N.J. transit.(there are so many bus drivers with tattooea that it must be required)lol|`|Plu6OVoGaa	No because not many people will be able to see it. You'll probably always be wearing long sleeves anyways.
wCVSwm2Kaa	Its because of the winter. The season makes your hair dry because of the high heat indoors. So either keep your hair up, or put a little hand cream in your hair.

MCeNakd4aa	right now at walmart they have the best straighting iron called from wet to straight. its only like 15-20 dollers and it will make your hair perfectly straight and it will stay straight and beautiful all day. i have curly hair. and i had my sis straighten my hair with it and it lasted straight all day and it felt good and healthy.i went to a theme park with my hair and it stood straight the whole day!! so yea if u are going to a concert u should definitely try it out.|`|mh9XYkGOaa	first find a non jipper avon person. and order a Advance Techniques and its straight iron gel (no more poofy)<br>  1. it works without looking gel-ish<br>  2. it makes your hair smell nice.|`|CGKzXHBaaa	hairspray, i guess, but not on top, cuz that makes it greasy<br>  maybe gell, run it through your hair from the underside. start at the roots and pull out along length of hair. <br>  <br>  also, when straightening your hair, put up the top half in a clip on top of your head (you will look absolutley ridiculous, haha) and straighten the under layer(s) first, then let down the top layer [or if you have a lot of hair, let down half ] and straighten that layer next. <br>  <br>  Hope you have fun. :]|`|s63bm0Guaa	first, when you do your hair, you need to blow dry it as smooth as you can get it, get yourself a smoothing shampoo and conditioner, i suggest Sleek Look by Matrix, then when blow drying, use a smoothing balm, then when you flat iron, spray with a flat iron spray befor ironing.  and take small sections, the smaller the better and the longer it will last.|`|X7PK06A4aa	if your goin to a concert that is in anyway "scene" then stick up is good, it makes it have volume which looks cool......sbut if you want it really straight straighten it, then put hair candy hair gel in it, and run a brush through it, then straighten it again and it will definitely stay :)|`|5sCpMpbWaa	Try straigthen them in really small section at a time and take your time while doing this. Use hair spray on a brush a brush it througth your hair before straigthen it.

But get yourself a nice moisturizing shampoo and conditioner....do you have blond in your hair at all? of so, use K-Pak everything...shampoo a, conditioner, deep conditioner!(in salons)<br>  if not, use Oatmeal and Honey shampoo and conditioner by TIGI(in salons)  But another thing that goes hand in hand with a flat iron, is a flat iron spray, it will protect your hair from the heat of the iron.<br>  Also get yourself a deep conditioner and do that once a week:)<br>   good luck:)|`|JZMfUDylaa	I like to use garnier fructis. I was looking at garneir fructis yesterday at wal mart (you should go there cause their prices are better than at any super markets) I forgot what it was called that hydrates hair but it will have an Orange circle with the hydration title. By the way I have some advice for you. conditioner is best for dry hair! so when you take a shower, the last thing you do, after when your done showering is to put conditioner on. Make sure you ring out as much waster out of your hair fist. Get out of the shower once your done soaking conditioner in your hair. Keep it in there for at least 45 min. I do this and trust me it works! you let the conditioner work where as most people just let it soak in there hair for 15 min. and that's really not enough time for the conditioner to help build the strength in. After 45 min. has passed go back in the shower and rinse! you don't have to do this everyday. just do it atleast twice to three times a week.|`|v8pl2RLUaa	I've used herbal essence before.

The celebrities you see in magazines are all photoshopped.|`|hPxU5eWPaa	Use lighter foundation, a small outline of eyeliner, with a bit of black eye shadow on top, and brown to blend in, or try the smokey eye effect. And use mascara, and light brown foundation or blusher going through the cheekbone, and cover lipstick (some people put liquid foundation on their lip) and clear lip gloss on top of that.|`|QAfhyMCVaa	First use concealer ad cover up any pimples or blemishes.

OHfZFR31aa	Normally 2-4 weeks. But since last week was NY Fashion Week and this week is London Fashion week (followed by Milan, then Paris) the agents are going to be so busy booking their girls on jobs around the world that they probably won't be looking at pictures until this season's shows are over. So wait until the end of March<br>  <br>  Most agencies will call you if they are interested. If they are not interested, they may send you a letter or email (they will never call), but most big agencies don't even bother<br>  <br>  Whatever you do, don't call them. It's completely unprofessional and will do nothing to change their mind or push them to look at your pictures again.|`|2bUIDeefaa	allow 2 months, I know its a while but its worth it.... trust me<br>  <br>  best of luck to you! :)|`|PN7XMglOaa	If you got it right to their desk , they will only contact you if they see promise .|`|BO28Mn8haa	Usually a call if they want you.

Get your protein and fruits/veggies in regularly, along with the other two food groups. No sweets!|`|AA11461043	don't eat alot and get you heart rate up in the morning before you eat. it burns calories and boosts you metabolism|`|qbnrzyCZaa	What I do is do loads of exercise but not too much or else your gonna puke... which is never the way to lose weight :) you should eat healthy Tyson chicken with a great salad  BUT REMEMBER NOT TO PUT DRESSING BECAUSE DRESSING HAS A LOT MORE FAT THE YOU THINK!

s63bm0Guaa	Hi there, best thing non surgically is to pick up Rogain, or Nioxin(in salons)<br>  but review your diet if it has changed a bit in the last year, make sure you are getting the proper vitamins. Also, if you don't feel that is the problem, speak to your Dr. There may be other underlying health issues....certain illnesses, or hormonal imbalances, ie: thyroid.|`|wCVSwm2Kaa	Ok Do this everyday!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!... <br>  <br>  -Take showers in the morning! <br>  - Make sure the blow dryers not right next to your head burning your scalp.<br>  -Use a Chi, or another other good brand straitener! the 100 doller+ ones dont burn your hair<br>  - Use Moose, Blow dryer, straitener Heat protectent cream!<br>  -Take "warm" shower feel the cold when your in there. The heat from the water kills your hair! B4 you jump out of the shower put the water on freezing and wash your hair for a few seconds because the cooold water calms your hair when you blow dry it<br>  - Ok This is one of the "most" Important things you have to remember. Use a Wide Tooth Comb When your hairs wet, or damp! Brushs rip your hair out when its wet. When its dry use a plastic comb! <br>  <br>  <br>  Hope this Helps!|`|Ruifi0GSaa	To prevent hair loss, massage the scalp with olive oil every evening for eight days.

2bC0dvPKaa	That sounds good, as long as the foundation and moisturizer isn't overdone. Usually for every-day wear people put on a little mascara and moisturizer, and maybe some tinted chapstick. Whatever you do, make sure it looks nice and natural. Make yourself pretty, but other than that try to make it seem as if  you are not wearing any makeup at all!|`|XiQn2Y2Maa	Nope not too much at all. Most people wear WAY more than that like eye liner, mascara, eyeshdow, lipgloss, and they really cake it all on. Its pretty sick looking, but if its just that and its not too much, than it should be good [:|`|N7I1NT6Maa	No I'd say that's good.  Maybe some bronzer if you felt like it, or light eyeliner, but I think that's a fine amount of makeup.  You could curl your eyelashes if you felt like "dolling up" without putting more makeup on...|`|RcBkUBsfaa	thats good|`|c5e9095ff83173c9cdfccea43110436aaa	No! <br>  I know a seventh grader who wears mascara, eyeliner, foundation, blush, lip gloss, and eyeshadow. And it isn't necessarily cakey, it all depends on how you put it on.|`|gdGDvWTDaa	thats  almost nothing hun|`|VsAZ4cJNaa	that sounds about right <br>  I hope your not wearing too much foundation that makes you look cakey, cuz that's the worst. If you can't tell that your wearing makeup, then it's not much at all.
5XYlHv6Paa	You can see it wearing off after you take a shower the 1st time. U will be a little lighter. After that, your color will fade in like 2-3 days, just gradually.<br>  <br>  There's a few levels, pick a lower level of spray for a more natural tan.<br>  <br>  Exfoliate in the shower right before the tan, and you won't streak. I've never streaked at all.|`|N48qV69daa	It lasts about a week, and you really cant tell its fading, You have to start at the lowest tone first, so it becomes more natural the more you do it. You can prevent streaking by once you get out of the mist room pat your body down with the towel and not rub. Streaking is where you can actually see the tan streaks. <br>  Good luck! I love doing it! I do it all the tIME!|`|hEZ16rpAaa	When can you see it wearing off: The results differ with everyone depending on how well you maintain your tan. They tell you not to go swimming, sweat, take long showers, etc. the day you have it applied. But this isn't really true. It constantly rubs off on your clothes, carseats, everything as long as you have it applied. It's pretty gross. It typically lasts five to seven days, maybe nine if you push for it, but it definitely won't look as good as it had earlier that week.<br>  How to prevent streaking: There's not much you can really do to prevent streaking once it happens. But to maintain your tan longer, apply lotion often. The more often the better. And do not try to exfoliate. Be light when you're shaving also, as it removes a small layer of skin. Be sure to apply lotion after showers because as I said earlier, it removes some of your tan.<br>  Can you make your skin look natural: Honestly, no. There will always be at least one day that week when after you become too spotty (you'll know what I mean when you read my next answer in regards to streaking) you will exfoliate your tan off, leaving you completely pale. And then the next day you're really tan again. It looks odd, to say the least. Expect to get some wtf looks from people that see you on a daily basis, especially if you get the mystic tans done really dark.<br>  What streaking is: When your tan does start to fade, it doesn't fade the way a natural one would. I wouldn't necessarily say it streaks, either. It comes off almost.. spotty. The first time I got a spray tan, the person told me when it comes off you look like a leopard. And though it sounds weird, that's the best description I could give you. It will come off almost in spots - some big, some small. It will first come off rougher skin areas like the elbows and the knees, as well areas where you perspire such as the underarms, the back of the knee area, etc. It may also come off areas that have the most physical contact - such as your thighs due to sitting. Streaking occurs from taking too long of showers, baths, etc. The same will happen in the rain. Tight clothes may also remove your tan - bras can leave lines, especially from the underwire.<br>  Other things to know about spray tanning: It isn't smart to get these if you live in a place where it rains often. It isn't smart to get these if you want to do anything that could make you sweat - such as work out or tan naturally. They claim the spray tan can help in developing a natural tan but even if this is true, the sweating from natural tanning will keep you from doing it, unless you want streaks from where you perspire. Streaks like that arne't subtle either. Imagine, a completely tanned body with a pale white line running through it - it looks as weird as it sounds. Also, something no one told me before I tanned and really should have is that while you may be able to lightly shave fine hair like on your legs with the spray tan, you can't shave down there without it coming off and looking really weird. So basically you have to either go in with underwear - which leaves a crazy tanline - or something or plan waxing sessions around it. It really does become a burden, and the costs exceed the rewards, because it does look unnatural. I thought it was sexy when I first got it, but I literally looked like I was a different race. And it was debilitating because I couldn't even do basic workouts and I was always terrified of if we were going outdoors in gym class. And rain was terrifying/embarassing.

You could raise your levels by taking pills, having more sex, or just by exercising more.  But this really wouldnt help you out too much.  As you grow older you will develop a thicker beard, but it takes time.
H3PcFertaa	Are you using the same artist that has done your previous work? Then you should have a good feel for how he/she works, and should definitly tell him/her exactly what you said here.  If you are going to a new artist, then I would advise researching and finding the best tattoo artist that you can, and they will work with you and probably do some freehand to tie it all together. It sounds like your idea will be a fine creative personal piece, and any good reputable experienced artist would love to work on it with you.  Take any images that have anything appealing to you to show, or may have parts that you like or styled like you are envisioning to help get the feel of what you are looking for across.  http://www.intermonet.com/japan/hokusai/...  http://horthistoria.com/wp-content/uploa...  http://home.flash.net/~cameron/japanese_...  http://www.nysun.com/pics/4379.jpg  http://www.orientaloutpost.com/usa/n4248...  http://www.orientaloutpost.com/usa/n4253...  http://www.tituspowell.com/Tutorial/Hand...  http://www.istockphoto.com/file_thumbvie...

s63bm0Guaa	This all depends......its all up to that individual stylist....<br>  im a hairstylist myself, and TRUST me......i have seen some not so great work come out of top salons in our city but AWESOME work come out of the more simple salons......it really is all in that persons hands, not the salon as a whole.|`|3k2NjOWsaa	Please please do NOT go to supercuts or any other places like it.  The stylists are generally only taught how to do mens hair and straight cuts on women.  I made the big mistake of going there just because it was cheap.  They completely butchered my hair.  You're best off just going to a salon.  Even though it will be more expensive, it will be worth it because they are more trained, so they actually know how to do layers.|`|4w361g8Laa	I would be concerned with going somewhere like that. I mean, I'm sure they're are talented stylists there but unless you know who they are and can make an appointment, you might get stuck with someone who will totally jack up your hair. A lot of stylist who are right out of school go to Supercuts, Haircuttery or other chains because it's guaranteed pay (usually an hourly wage + commission) while they are honing their skills since starting to build a clientele is very tough. Most other salons are commission only or booth rental (you paid based on the amount of work you do...nobody in your chair, you don't get paid). <br>  <br>  Also, curly hair is not easy to cut and takes a lot more practice than straight...theres even a school in New York that has an intense 3 day training class just for curly hair...and you can't even go to the class unless you've been a stylist for at least 5 years! Anyway, I would suck it up and pay a little more at a good salon. Ask people you know who have curly hair where they go or just ask strangers. Or call around to salon's in your area and ask for someone who specializes in curly hair.|`|uX5hO3d8aa	Yes they do a fine job for simple cuts. Most hair stylists work at multiple places so you'll find the woman who works at Supercuts where you can get a $12 hair cut also works at Regis Salon or other much more expensive places. Do you think she cuts hair any differently at Supercuts than at Regis?<br>  <br>  And most of the time you can walk-in. No appointment is required, however at certain times on certain days it may be busy and there will be a wait.|`|uLelMuqZaa	If you just want a simple cut, it should end up fine! And yes, SuperCuts does accept walk-ins. But as others have said, curly hair is harder to cut, so you might want to go to a salon. The choice is up to you.

But if you want messier or more random curls you can put mousse and gel in your hair and scrunch it while using a blow dryer. When its half dry spray on some hair spray and then continue scrunching with the dryer. It sounds like it'll look poofy but I have hair like yours and I swear it works. Also, if you don't want any frizz, using aquage curling cream instead of the other products will do a lovely job. Its kinda expensive though.|`|I6zQeNGzaa	Apply Paul Mitchell's Skinny Serum & Heat Seal to damp hair. Blow dry and then curl with a curling iron.|`|hQNHzc6faa	That hair looks cute.

They are expensive, you can get them on ebay quite cheap, DONT buy them from a hairdressers as they charge to much, if you do anything,, please buy them, you will be AMAZED at how good your hair looks!!<br>  <br>  If you do straighten your hair, please make sure you use some sort of oil spray, GHD do they're own brand which is expensive, but you can use cheaper, there are lots available, you will ruin your hair if you don't, and that applies to using ANY hair irons, without oil spray.

iLuc1xyAaa	Hats off to you, seems the girl does really like you.<br>  First off before asking this girl out, start to write things about her, for example; What here hobbies are, what kind of films she may like, here fav food, anything about her that you can use. This will help you come to a conclusion of where to ask her on a date.<br>  Ok so lets say you have figured out a date you can offer, and its only a few hours till you ask the big question. Dont be a slob, do your hair, be clean, and make sure you dress well. The best thing for you to do is dress the same way as you do, she obvs really likes you for who you are.<br>  Now is the time to ask her out, but of course you need her attension. Compliment her, but be careful. Unless they are desperate, they might think you are desperate or making something too obvious. So maybe tell her you like her new hairstyle but then go behind her and mess around with it, spice it up. She'll like your courage to go play about with her hair.<br>  When the time comes to ask her out, wait for the opportune moment. Trust your instincts; they will tell you when the time is right. It's probably best not to do it in front of her friends or in front of your friends. It's easier for both of you if you are alone.<br>  Move in closer, be alone and look down. Look up at her eyes, look lost in her world for a second, and then say "I,(pause),like you. So...(cough)..Will you go out with me" While you say this look down. Look up when you say me and smile questioningly. If that isn't your style, there is another way to ask a girl out. All you have to do is walk up (make sure she's alone), and ask her to go out with you in a confident (but relaxed!) manner.<br>  If she says "I'll think about it" it's not a good sign, although she could just be nervous, or caught up in the moment, and she's being careful not to make a stupid mistake. Don't bug her about it, let it go a few days - if she doesn't bring it up again, it's a no. If you see any facial expressions, like an eye raise, make sure you say, "It's okay if you say no.<br>  Dont pressure or bug her, just be yourself. Best of luck to you.<br>  Always remember if she says no, its her loss.<br>  x|`|7a4769988b8e82f8cbe41cafbbfe65eaaa	Ask her to a comedy. Mall Cop. Keep it casual.

Just make sure you follow the directions on the bottle.|`|TPPZp8IYaa	Apply a product called REDKEN GLASS 01. It is a smoothing serum, you only need a tiny amount, so the bottle will last for ages. You will find it at any hairdresser or specialty store that sells REDKEN products. It definitely works! It also gives your hair a brilliant shine and you can apply it to wet or dry hair. Hope that helps.|`|L4gtJfNmaa	dont wash it as much.  Oily air is more resistive to the effect of static electricty|`|6IxJPUh3aa	I've had the exact same problem! It probably means that your hair is lacking moisture, so make sure you use conditioner when your washing your hair.    I recommend Herbal Essences Hello Hydration line, or Hairapy. If you have the money, Bumble and Bumble have fantastic hair supplies as well.     If you already use conditioner, try some anti-frizz hair cream after your hair dries. (I know it's for frizz, but it moisturizes your hair and that helps with reducing static) I use Garnier (i love the smell), but I haven't used any other products to compare.     Try not to curl/straighten your hair too much, it damages your hair the heat and all. :l     Good luck.

However, as long as the place is reputable, then you're ok. The shop you go to should have a minimum price, so, you could expect to pay the minimum and maybe a little more. Two fangs shouldn't be that much trouble. Is she getting a mouth to go with it? If you have been to Hot Rod Tattooing more than once, you should know the minimum price, as well as how they charge after that, for color and things of that nature...

Why would you put up with a crap piece of work for the rest of your life just to save yourself a small amount of cash once in your life? Trust me when I say, the cheaper the place, the worse the tattoo. And often the real cheap places have lax hygeine standards too.<br>  <br>  Anyway that design would be very simple for a [GOOD] artist to work out with her. That is the proper way of doing things.

Do you realize that you would need about 3 sessions with 2 - 4 wks healing inbetween?  Do you know that your age does make a difference? - because it is illegal to tattoo you, your body isn't finished growing and it will distort, and your brain is also still developing and you literally will not think in the same manner when you reach adulthood.   Do you realize that if you have anyone tattoo you that is not licenced, that you risk a 'bad tattoo', an infection - MRSA, Blood Borne Pathogens etc., or even death?  And the only opinion that matters in choosing your personal body art image, out of the choices that you have, is yours.    You need to wait at least 3 years.

kSHwAHbeaa	Hi, Chuck    I am a firm believer that if a procedure will make you feel better, then do it. Even if others don't mention your nose to you but you see it when you look in the mirror and it bothers you, then do it.     The thing that stuck out most to me about your question is the fact that your friends mentioned that it was vain to think that you'd want to do that. I completely disagree, and here's why: when you can't function in everyday life because your nose "gets in the way" of normal activities, then do it. If it hinders you from anything, do it. Even if it hinders you from looking in the mirror and being satisfied with your appearance, then do it.     The reason I say that is because just last week I had a simple procedure done: Botox. I am only 26 years old, but I have a fine line on my forehead. Getting the treatments now will prevent it from becoming deeper later in life. My dad told me I was being vain, but now when I look in the mirror I don't see that wrinkle and I no longer have to worry about other people seeing it either. Some of my friends thought I was crazy, too but I think it's one of the best decisions I've ever made because I FEEL BETTER!    So, I could relate to your story/situation and I hope that I helped you somewhat. If you decide to do it, good luck!!|`|QU1qB9yFaa	i think if you really think it will make you feel more confident/ and really want to do it , you should if it will make you happier :)|`|xzNr2RmIaa	You need more than Rhinoplasty.|`|gLXzVbm8aa	if its not letting u do what uwnat u should totally go for it. u should be happy with your body but if it getting in the way of things then u should do whatever u can to change it.|`|gVRma7Mxaa	no your nose is fine|`|VihV4Troaa	i think you should. it's not really an ugly nose, it just gets in the way of things you try to do. so go for it.|`|064hnHggaa	I personally dont think there is anything wrong with your nose ! You said it doesn't bother you much now , so why change it ? I know you said its difficult to work with sometimes when your trying to do day to day things. But also , you wrestle ? So getting a nose job isn't really a good idea. If you were to go and wrestle it could really damage your face if you take a shot to the nose. However , it is up to you but honestly sweetie , theres nothing wrong with it !     Anything else you want to know , email me lynseyashwave@yahoo.com|`|ZNd4N1wtaa	no! you're nose is perfectly fine. honestly. it is.|`|WyugeTxSaa	Never mind what your friends say, if you think a rhinoplasty will make your life better then do it.

If you want to make a Mediterranean accent, that is cool, but not mandatory. From what i ve seen in hookah bars, people are dressed mostly  casually, although there are some that look better then the others.|`|u9MWpkvNaa	Something can sit in and not reveal yourself to the world, IMHO.  A lot of the hookah bars I have been in you are sitting on the floor straight across from other people, so you wanna be able to sit with your legs crossed on the floor, just in case. Also, something you don't mind smelling smoky :P|`|iLIQIqvLaa	i think you can just wear anything. jeans and a shirt? its nothing that special.|`|AUsvrW8faa	Regular clothes.  No special outfit needed|`|6FIhIQ3Eaa	wat is a hookah bar? plese alaborate|`|tATsT9Byaa	Wear what you always wear when you go out!  It's nothing special...same as any other bar....

zL5GvUoQaa	The cream you are talking about is hair removal cream and is pretty much the same as shaving and if you bikini line is to sensitive to shave then i think that the hair removal cream will be worse, if you try it out on a small patch of skin you will prolly notice a strange smell and its because the cream is basically melting/burnig your hair off.    I would recommend that you go to a salon and get it waxed. it is a lot better than shaving because you only have to do it once every 4 weeks or so and with shaving the hair grows back thicker but with waxing the hair gradually gets thinner and thinner and eventually there will hardly be anything there.|`|noBjJglGaa	The creams are basically chemicals that burn the hair off. Many people get irritated with the creams as well.     Waxing doesn't hurt as bad as people say. Really...I have waxed my entire body and I am an esthetician so I do this on other people.

7TQ5qGWcaa	There are many things that you can do to prevent blackheads from appearing on your face. Most involve cleansing and some require the use of medications.   Avoid using creamy, greasy, and thick (emollient) products. This alone will greatly lessen your chances of sprouting blackheads.   Use a gentle and water-soluble acne cleanser.   DO NOT use bar soap!!! The ingredients that hold soap in a bar form can clog the pores in your skin. They can also cause skin cells to flake off prematurely and clog the pores. If you have dry skin you will need to use a cleanser that has a bit of moisturizer in it, but be careful! The excess moisturizers can cause an increase in oil on your skin.   Exfoliate to eliminate dead skin cells. If there are no skin cells to clog the pores, the natural oil is able to flow through freely. Skin Exfoliation also removes the built up dead cells from inside the pores that cause them to become misshapen and more-easily clogged. Using an skin exfoliant that contains 1% or 2% beta hydroxy acids (BHA or Salicylic Acid) will penetrate the lining of the pore. If you are unable to use BHAs, you could use products containing alpha hydroxy acids (AHA), however these acids are only good for surface exfoliation because they do not penetrate the pore lining.   Absorb excess oil. If you have oily skin, try using a clay mask that does not contain mint, peppermint or other irritating ingredients. This will absorb the oil that may clog the poor. If you have dry skin, this is not necessary because pimples on dry skin are caused by oil inside the pore, not on the surface of the skin. Also, oil-absorbing papers may help to reduce the oil in your pores.   Visit your dermatologist. Retinoids, which are a form of Vitamin A, can help regulate the pore shape which will keep oil flowing normally. The most common retinoids are tretinoin and adapalene, found in prescriptions such as Avita, Renova, Retin-A, Tazorac, and Differin.   Other medications. Hormone blockers and low-dose birth control pills can lower levels of androgens (the male hormone) and Accutane should be discussed with your physician in severe cases of oily skin and breakouts.|`|3oGRNQKyaa	drug stores sell strips..  fot blackheads..they work very well..but the best thing is...well ur suppose to have a wet nose so it can stick..but the best thing to do is actually to steam up ur face with just waster in a bowl(can add some mind/honey or lemon to freshen it up) and drape a towl over ur head..do this for about a week,each day and then ir face will be really red (ohh do it for about 5mins) and yeah ...then wet the face with cold water.and PAT dry (not to roughen it) and just wet the nose and dry the hands..simple :)  do the nose thing quickyl..or just pat dry the face,not the nose..apply the strips and waa laa :)
QGU7JAIUaa	Its fine to brush your hair is wet but gently, people often recommend not brushing your hair when its wet, because when your hair is wet its delicate. x|`|mh9XYkGOaa	IDK. But I heard that too, and your supposed to use a comb.|`|uLelMuqZaa	Hair is softest when wet, so supposedly, brushing wet hair makes it stretch out and break and cause split ends.

The K-Pak products actually help repair damaged hair and strengthen it to prevent further damage.

e1434520b7d6b7db2b483084c9ad434aaa	Long layers work very well with curls. The layers will help with drying and untangling time, and the hair will also hang better. However, do not get short layers as they will stick up and look funny. Don't let them thin your hair with razors either or it will look ratty at the ends as they grow out. If you want to find a stylist who knows how to work with curly hair you can find ratings by region here: http://www.naturallycurly.com/curlsalons    Here are some basic tips for curly hair that you might find helpful:  *Don't shampoo every day.  *Comb conditioner through hair in the shower.  *Apply styling products to dripping wet hair. Scrunch or twirl hair to achieve desired shape.  *Use styling products suited for your hair type. Dont know yours? http://www.naturallycurly.com/hair-types  *Avoid terrycloth towels on hair; use linen, paper towels, or t-shirts instead.  *Air dry or use a diffuser with your blowdryer.  *Don't touch (or brush!) your hair while its drying.  *Once completely dry scrunch out any crunchy texture.    For hair type specific products check out these forums:  http://www.naturallycurly.com/curltalk/  There you can find others with the same hair type and try out some of their favorite products. I would recommend something, but I dont know your hair type. :)    Lastly, it has made my hair so much better since I started the curly girl method! I used to almost never wear it down (it was a frizz/poof ball), but now I have pretty, shiny curls. ~:) Its pretty radicalno sulfates (shampoo) or siliconesbut its so great for curly hair.

Naturally curly long hair tends to become frizzy, especially when brushed. If naturally curly hair is thick and long,  its sometimes impossible to comb. This leads up to the question, what can a woman do to control naturally curly long hair and prevent it from becoming frizzy and unmanageable when styling?    I have long naturally curly hair, and I am very happy with my hair - when I have time for styling my hair properly that is. I can practically predict the weather with my hair. The more humid the weather, the more curly my long hair becomes, but if I allow my long curly hair to dry without styling it first, it turns into a frizzy unmanageable mess.    I found a product that is fantastic for styling my long curly hair, and when I follow specific steps for styling my long curly hair, Im very happy with the results. If you have long curly hair, try the following tips and product suggestions for achieving an attractive long curly hairstyle. You can have long curly flowing locks of hair that youll absolutely love.    Conditioning Long Curly Hair    Its essential to properly condition long curly hair with a top-quality conditioner in order to comb through it without causing breakage and damage. A top-quality conditioner is also helpful in preventing frizzy hair. Find a couple of different brands of hair conditioners that work well for your particular hair type, and alternate them often. When the same conditioner is used continuously, it sometimes stops working to its full potential. Keep in mind you dont have to use the same brand of conditioner and shampoo. Many people think they have to use the same brand, but if you find a conditioner for your long curly hair that you like, use it with whatever brand of shampoo you prefer.

KGppArcfaa	I haven't used this one yet, mainly because i have found gnc line vitamins to be poor quality (like gnc brand biotin only has 500mcg...that's like 0.5 of a mg, so you'd have to take like a bottle a day almost to add up to something noticeable).   That being said, I have heard some good things about them. If you do get them, please let me know what you think =)    I am currently taking Hair Stimulator Vitamins ( I found them on ebay, but they also have a website hairstimulator.net) and im just finishing my first bottle. I haven't noticed any growth yet, but my hair has definitely improved health wise. My hair seems much stronger and softer and shiner (people have been commenting lol)  So I do recommend those.    Let me know what you think of the gnc ones if you try them =) Good luck!|`|Nicf5B8faa	I would try to research first with all products you buy.    I go to various sites like maybe nextag.

The best way to achieve curly hair is to do the following. Below ill be a list of instructions and products which would benefit the style.    1) Wash your hair using a shampoo/conditioner that enchances shine and soft hair.    2) Using your hairdryer tip your hair upside down and blow dry it when its half dry scrunch it using mouse. Apply John Freida Frizzease serum before doing so.    3) When hair is dry pin the top layer of your hair up. Using your straightners or curlers begin to curl the bottom half of your hair. If using straightners start from the bottom of your hair and wrap it upwards and then hold it once it gets to the top for ten seconds and then unwrap it. Use hairspray on each curl to retain it.    4) When you have curled the bottom half of your hair do the same as you did in 3) but only curl your hair to the middle of your hair.     5) Using your straightners straighten your side fringe (if you have one) or fringe.    6) Spray with hairspray and apply a glistening serum.
94X0R3Vraa	I have very frizzy, very very thick curly hair. I still to this day have yet to find anything that works. Ive thinned it, nothing. Ive flat ironed it, which make is Straight, thick and frizzy and ive tried frizz-eaze, herbal essences, EVERY THING!.. the best thing ive found is the Japanese or bionic straightening. Its mucho money, cost me around 600 but my hair was so flat, so straight and so silky i was almost in tears! It stayed that way for about 6 months. I never had to flat iron it or anything. Jump out of the shower and let it dry natural! It was great!

RWt78jE5aa	I use to tan when I was younger ( like 14-16 ) which I will never do again because of the bad things that could and will happen. I am naturally pale and it took me a couple weeks of going every other day to get any kind of color/tan. So my advice to you is just get the mystic spray tan at a tanning place, it looks better and doesn't go away for awhile.|`|NZKiSfVOaa	Yeah, you'll probually burn and go red at first, then go brown/dark, but you'll get skin cancer, so is it worth it?  Everyones pale when they first go on holiday and when your on holiday just make sure to go in the sea/pool lots because that always helps you get a tan, and use suncream spf at the lowest 15, but use higher to avoid chances of skin cancer and make sure to cover any moles with A LOT of suntan cream.   (:|`|BRIeyc8Raa	yes, but the results will appear very unnatural.|`|rnW8h3vCaa	yes my mom is P-A-L-E  but she goes to the beds and she gets really dark|`|WMhhmWBWaa	just go tanning. for the first couple time just start out at like 6 minutes then everytime you go back increase it by like a minutes or 2. or if you like the time that you go in for that stay at that time. you wont burn if you dont go in too long. when you go there buy a lotion they have many to choose from. tryst me it helps. it give you a lesser chance of burning and you get a tan faster and it lasts longer.|`|4b127bdc65641a05881903d7090f19c2aa	If you don't tan well in natural sunlight you won't tan any better in a tanning bed.  You'll probably just burn and you don't want to do that before your trip.  Take along lots of sunscreen, at least SPF 30, and use it to protect yourself from burning.  Don't forget to reapply it after swimming.  Even the waterproof ones can come off, especially if you dry yourself with a towel after swimming.|`|2I5XqMDzaa	ull probably burn. i would never fake in bake but if u want to ull turn red the first few times (my friend did it and she was pale)|`|ntU8Gq45aa	Yes you should tan but it is bad for you|`|S6WOighOaa	it depends.. i had the same problem.. just make sure you get a tanning lotion with darker bronzes in it. You might come out the first few times a bit red but then it should turn into a nice tan.    Another thing if that doesn't work out you can do a spray tan, they usually last about a week. And if you do go for the spray tan, makesure you don't go into a booth that sprays you it makes you streaky. Try and look for a salon that does it personally, it makes a total difference.    well i hope that helped!  have a great trip, and God bless!|`|KoJ0rddfaa	I like the sound of Edward Cullen's Future Wife's answer.     I am very very pale and havn't had a tan, not even once in my life. Always made fun of every summer for it too! Gosh darn...Then again, I've never tried that hard. As a kid always covered in spf 45 by my mom. haha. Now I am 15 and planning on going to the tanning salon for the first time and go everyday until summer in hopes of getting atleast a "base tan". Even that is good for me because I've never even come close. But the salon I am going to got a red head tan, according to my cousin!! Andthis past summer my friend who is strawberry blonde got a tan! So there must be hope for the rest of us, right? Just as white as they were b4...except I have dirty blonde hair. I think you'll get color if you go everyday for a little at a time. When I was googling earlier today for myself, I found that the people at the salon will help you if you tell them it's your first time and need help with a plan for getting tan.     Best of luck! Let me know if you get a tan?? Take before and after pictures please!

AA10849332	My mom is also very much against the body mod culture as a whole.     The unfortunate reality is, there is no really good way to get them to understand. One way that I've found though is to include my parents in knowing about the healing processes for the work that I get done.     Really with piercings, the only thing that is more permanent is some kind of anchoring, be it dermal anchors, microdermals, trandermal implants, or subdermal implants. And even those can be removed by incision with a scalpel.    Tattooing and scarification are permanent, particularly scarification. I always think out for a long time what I'm going to get done. Some of my plans my mother doesn't like (like the flames I'm saving to get on my left leg) but she thinks that my music arm (my right) and the hummingbird that I'm getting done on my left arm to remember her mother are great.    beauty is a perception that each person sees differently. explain to them the next time that something comes up why you feel that body modification is beautiful, and even spiritual. I feel the same way about it. After I explained to my parents and let them in on what actually goes on, they haven't been so bad though they still disagree with some of my choices. Presently my mother is bothered by my plans for my upcoming 26th birthday. I am going to do my first suspension.    sometimes you can find some good stuff to help your parents understand by going to http://www.bmesine.com   You probably already go there, but if not its worth checking out.|`|Asm4AKOOaa	lots of girls have there tongue pierced so not sure why they'd be so upset about that one . maybe they view it as having a bad reputation or sexual meaning .|`|bAYVSfdJaa	They're close minded, but it's still their house.

11zEFfiuaa	I don't really think that a hair color can look slutty, its what the person does that makes them slutty. If you like the color, go for it! And good choice going to a salon.|`|S8kx69vSaa	Well, it is a color you would see on fake girls, trying to be cool.  But that's only if they wear too much makeup and dress revealing.  But as long as you keep it looking natural, and don't do either of those things, then your absolutly fine. It's a very pretty color.|`|W840msNTaa	A hair color can not make a girl look slutty.    Slutty depends on how you dress/makeup.|`|t94U523oaa	it depends on you features  posting a picture oh yourself would help|`|jmhTOXhcaa	it wont make you look sluty. i think its cute=]|`|rt4OnxkYaa	i dont really know how hair can look slutty.|`|ZMVs9bGxaa	its not slutty realy, it would look trashy if you had roots though so your gonna have to dye it often  and it depends how dark your skin is, it might not look natural|`|LPViotm7aa	Sure go for it...

yDkm4ULsaa	personally i would never get a tattoo of another person, especially some celebrity.    i can see why people would get tattoos of family members, i can understand those, but what if you dont really like the celebrity that much in 10 or 20 years?    of course some people will still like that person, but many regret tattoos like that.    its just like when someone gets a band tattoo and end up not liking the band anymore years later.    so just think about that, i mean, if your doing modeling already and shes your idol then you may not regret it in the future, as long as you wont regret it id say go for it.|`|NBK3s2LVaa	Thats not a bad idea at all it means something to you,shes your inspiration so I think its a good idea atleast you won't regret it if you love it her that much|`|7BVyV4Fdaa	I want one too, I don't think it is... she's like... my Idol though... Haha.|`|1l04qpOKaa	I don't understand why she is some girl's idol? I mean she did drugs and killed herself! How is that a role model? but whatever you like, it's your body. Just giving my opinion  :o)|`|0xtU8bG5aa	that would be kinda cute. where were you planning to putting it at?|`|gAuIixm6aa	If you have to ask, then probably so. Personally, the idea of getting a tattoo of a pop culture figure who OD'd naked on barbiturates seems a little distasteful but hey, do what makes you happy.|`|jeqpSdtkaa	I think it's an awesome idea. if she has had some sort of impact on your life. and it's meaningful to you.   do it!|`|VQ2Lk4vWaa	I think it's a very cute idea. I am very intrigued by Marilyn Monroe. I dont think of her as a role model or inspiration, she is just very interesting to me. I got her eyes tattooed on my back. They are a part of whole tattoo so you dont really notice them, but I know what they are so it means something to me. I think her signature on your wrist or inner forearm would be cute.

It's great!|`|wJuOZA3kaa	getting rid of under eye bags and puffiness is a matter of several factors. You need to try and get more rest obviously, and the other key thing is to drink water. They say around 8 glasses a day. That should help a lot.    Do you have allergies? That could also be a cause of your puffiness. A quick fix in the morning is to splash your eyes with cold water. You can also use the popular home remedy of tea bags- placing them under your eye for 5 min. or so.    There are also a ton of different creams that help puffiness. I have a lot of product reviews and other great tips on http://www.nomorepuffyeyes.com. Check them out!    Hope this helps you, I have done a lot of research on puffy eyes and love to help people with this embarrasing issue.

mAt9he0Zaa	i buy a lot of the clean and clear products like the invisible blemish treatment and cleansing wash there all good:)|`|9GYrj5W9aa	Clean and Clear is NOT a good brand. They use cheap ingrediants that are bad for your skin that totally strip it of the natural oils. Try somewhere like clinique. They will give you a skin analysis and will tell you your exact skin type and condition and wil recommend a range of products for you :)|`|e7d8eccb6f819fb0623145f8b7f2099eaa	Yes, your option is good.  As you are only 13 what I recommend that before you scrub your face please mix the face scrub with a face cleanser. This is to prevent your skin from getting a shock as your skin is still young.   It seems you have an oily skin, importantly ... not to use oil base - scrub, cleanser or cream moisturiser.    Do not buy product that are meant for matured skin, always start from the mild and as you grew older than you go a next step further.  Read the instruction on the product and ask questions if unsure.       Steps on proper cleansing  1) wet your face and starts scrubbing.  2) do not forget the chin and neck  3) do not scrub the eye area       ( use face cleanser )  4) towel dry face  5) apply moisturiser  6) to do every morning and at night    I always do this without fail.  Now I am 43 yrs old  and my face is a smooth as a baby's bottom ...lol...    Best of luck!|`|j2yLjm6Naa	Try washing your face twice daily, also if you beat egg whites and put them on your face and leve on for 10 min. then wash off that helps too.|`|dSF3s31maa	WASH YOUR FACE|`|otzViCKQaa	Try biore warming blackhead fighting cream wash. Or clean and clear face wash as you mentioned. Also once or twice a week soak a small towel into warm water an gently scrub your face. Once your done dont wipe your face with an dry towel.   Use the same small towel make sure you wash it before you apply it on your face, hence leave da skin bit wet.   As your skin is very sensitive id recommend you boots cucumber cream its very light and moisturizes well its also suitable for oily skin tone|`|glcggYntaa	wash your face twice a day with like dove or something  NEVER use soap, that dries out your skin.  i had the same problem as you did &i had so many blackheads  what i did was steamed my face, then used lemon juice which   kills all the dirt in your skin &then i rinsed with ht water again &then put a cream on my face  i did this for like 2 weeks &my skin cleared up !|`|9dr0BZIbaa	Make sure you maintain a healthy beauty routine.  Wash your face twice a day.  Make sure to use a toner after washing your face with regular soap.  This gets rid of any dirt or excess oil or dirt in your pores.  As well, cleanse your skin every three days.  After washing your face, moisturize with an oil-free moisturizer.  Try not to touch your face during the day.  This collects dirt in oil, causing pimples.  If you wear makeup, make sure to remove it at the end of the day in order to prevent it from clogging the skin.  As well, try to maintain a healthy diet, full of bright fruits and vegetables.|`|bjvZZ3DGaa	Hi, I have really oily skin, and I've been trying this new regimen, and you should try it also!     Aspirin mask every 3 days: two uncoated tablets with some honey and put it on your face for no more than 10 minutes.    Wash your face with ONLY water. I cannot emphasize enough. ONLY.    Apply witch hazel with a cotton round.    THAT'S IT! And now my skin is so much better. Plus, it's cheap and you are not putting harsh chemicals on your young skin. :) Please try this.

AA11150213	Make up should match the colour of your face as much as possible for sure.<br>  <br>  The best place to do a match is your jaw, simply because you want something that is going to blend with your neck and face. Whatever you do do not test the make up on your hand ( a lot of people do this) our faces tend to be a slightly different colour than our hands.<br>  <br>  Also when testing try three colour that you think are pretty close to your natural skin tone and just dab each one on the side of you face by your jaw, this should help you do see which colour matches up best with you skin tone.|`|MCeNakd4aa	i use sheer cover mineral makeup and it works great! it makes my skin feel good and not to thick either. they show you how what colors for your skin. if u are light or tan or dark.they have pictures of different womens faces.it cost 30$ but it comes with a whole package of items like concealer.two mineral items,mascara, and makeup remover.etc<br>  its alot cheaper then bare minerals and works better on my face. bare minerals didnt cover up my acne it showed more of it.|`|N85XB4jZaa	mineral makeup accuatly works well on me!!!<br>  wen u pick out a founation like that, always get a shade lighter then ur color (not to light tho!)<br>  i read that in a magize. and its true.|`|kRtDNo4Baa	OMG!

vHrvFzZpaa	The best solution is a dermatologist. Since you are on a budget, I reccomend just cleaning up problem areas with alcohol, and sweeping up with Clearisil. After washing your face with warm water of course. All are cheap, and drug store available.|`|BRT2teSqaa	Proactive just has Benzoyl Peroxide as the active ingredient.  Look at any products in walmart, and look at the label.

And continue washing your face2-3 times a day|`|440bc9fc52f071a2327870a6bd744e8faa	What you need to do is start drinking plenty of water. Also, watch what you eat- do not eat fatty foods or fried foods. Also, put Vitamin E on your skin or take the pills. I think Neutrogena with Microclear technology is good- use the foam or cream (the green or orange one). For your scars, Neutrogena has something for those. Good luck and Happy Hunting :D

dHkvVlONaa	I have all three.  I can;t decide what one my favorite is, it's either my belly button or my nose.<br>  <br>  Helix was most painful for me, but I barely felt the lip piercing at all (I actually had it pierced five times-3 on one side and two on the other, not all at the same time though.  <br>  <br>  I got one side, it got infected, took it out, got it re pierced, then the all fell out and the ring fell out over night and the next morning it was closed :( so then i re did it and now its fine, and ive had it for a year now.  And the other side , the lady that did it did it crooked, so I took it out and re pierced it myself.  So basically I have had a needle shoved through my lip 5 times lol)<br>  <br>  Ive had my belly button twice, once it rejected, then i got it re-done.<br>  <br>  I has 3 in my right ear helix, and 4 in the other ear helix, but I took them all out cause I got sick of always hitting them and then they would hurt.

AA10849332	I assume you mean millimeters by saying mil......      if you have "normal" ear piercings right now, you're at 1mm.    you could try 2mm, but really it would be safer for you to go for 1.5mm.    starting immediately at 3mm is going to result in blowout and pain IF you can even get it in. you'll also cause famage to the fistula which may make it to where you can't stretch larger.    wait about a month between stretches. I'm not sure how large you're wanting to go, but once you hit around 6mm you're going to want to wait at least 2-3 months between stretching.|`|KoAQn69Vaa	I would move to 1.6mm if you have normal size pierced ears - you don't want to risk putting something too big in there too quickly.|`|LDLTjNCraa	I think it is, my friend tried a 3 not long after her first one, and she told me she cried because it hurt that much.  Stretch them slowly.|`|AA11118392	depends on what size it is now. try to go up one size at a time. Piercings with a gun are about 1mm so go onto 1.6mm. if it was pierced at 1.6 (like normal barbell size) then you should go to 2mm.  By "3mil" im guessing you mean 3.2mm. only go to 3.2mm if your currently at 2.4    http://www.bodyjewelleryshop.com/online_...  here are all the gauge's take them one by one leaving 2 weeks in between each stretch. i know its slow but you can start to jump 2mm at a time when you get to about 10mm. stretching too fast can cause loads of problems so go slow at first.|`|19c8NIGHaa	eww no offence but it looks awful! when your older your gonna end up with saggy ear lobes and wont be able to wear normal earings ever again. What if you went to a formal party and you had them nasty things in your ears?   get your tragus done instead! :) sorry to be so negative but god it makes me cringe!|`|NBjta8Kyaa	i started mine off with a three  just get loads of Vaseline  it helps|`|dFHHsjCDaa	that's what? an 8 gauge?    i think that's a little too big. the biggest i'd start with would be 12.
euZRbiA2aa	Savlon is fine or use Bepanthon for nappy rash its even better.|`|C0HZ8ZB4aa	I used Savlon on my first tattoo and it scabbed badly and a lot of the ink got pulled out. It's a good antiseptic but not good for the quality of the tattoo.    For the rest of my tattoos, I've used Bepanthan. It's the nappy rash ointment I use on my son, my artist recommended it to me and I've since found out that everybody I know uses it and recommends it. All my tattoos with Bepanthan have turned out absolutely perfect, not a single touch up has been needed, whereas I had to get virtually the whole tattoo redone that I treated with Savlon.    Tattoo aftercare is a great issue of debate, and I know that from your end it's difficult to know who to trust when everyone says something different. I'm not suggesting that Bepanthan is the only thing that works. But it does work. 100% - you have not just mine but dozens of people I know's testimonials on that. I'm sure there are plenty of other great aftercare solutions out there, but I can't speak for any of them. But a word to the wise, bepanthan is much better than savlon!! If you go into the baby section in Boots, you'll find it with all the lotions and potions, in a long white tube. Alternatively go into any chemist and ask for it. It's only a couple of quid for a tube. (if somewhere doesn't have it - don't let them sell you an alternative nappy rash cream - there are loads of products on the market for nappy rash but they're not all good for tattoos!). Good luck.|`|MojYmo5Jaa	Savlon is the best thing to use as it is an antiseptic, this will keep your tattoo clean and healthy, and will help the healing process a lot quicker.|`|WYa3UY6Gaa	I don't live in england so I don't know.     if you have Tattoo Goo its one of the best.       Then when your tattoo starts to peel you can switch to any "scent & dye free lotion"    Here I use lubriderm.    ______________________________________...    Well since I looked up savlon, and it's an antibiotic no you shouldn't use that. You only need an antibiotic if your tattoo becomes infected. otherwise all you need to worry about is moisturizing it, and washing 2 -3x daily with antibacterial soap.|`|WQjk0nRKaa	Yes it,s fine,and when its healed to stop it fading apply a tiny bit of hand cream, hope i,v been of help,|`|7add460ae24c9452ae87b5a99c5aa756aa	Well what did they recommend that you use?  Any type of non scented lotion for your skin should work just fine.|`|kdryabU8aa	Yeah I used savlon on all five of mine|`|13ZYxG0Aaa	for the healing process? just use mild soap. that's what my tattoo artist told me to do. and i bought the tat goo at the shop to keep it moist, but apparently non scented moisturizer is just as good.|`|DtG4zpM2aa	I used bepanthen on mine for the 1st week, which was what my tattooist recommended, and tattoo healed well and looks great.   It's actually a nappy rash ointment and widely available, you can get it in Boots and probably lots of other places.|`|AA11528998	Tattoo Goo is about the best and a close second would be E45 moisturiser cream|`|riiyZtA1aa	no just keep it clean, dry and it will be ok no need for creams please|`|QD0coQuCaa	Caldesene Medicated Talc Powder is very good as you don't have to rub it on the skin.|`|AA11985426	NO Savlon is not ok to use, I used Savlon and my tattoo became very sore and red, I was then told by a much better tattooist than the one that did my tattoo that Savlon is not to be used.  The best one you can use is BEPANTHEN you can buy it at the chemist its a baby nappy cream.  Tattoo Goo is good but a bit expensive, stick to Bepanthen.|`|QKh5gCkfaa	Yes i used Savlon on mein and they are all fine just make sure you moisturise as well regularly as well|`|OQS1k0mYaa	i used bepathan on mine and it was soo much better.it's a nappy rash cream for babies but it soothes the sting and keeps the redness down at the same time well making it heal much much faster .i wouldn't put anything else on the tattoo|`|xKY5TjOlaa	dont use savlon use germolene is best i got 20 tattoos and i used germolene on all off mine germolene got antiseptic in it
BZEN8QXbaa	If you don't like the stars try something else like mini spirals or something like that..|`|6mZJSqBgaa	It totally depends on what your tattoos look like.  The right backgrond can help your tattoos pop out more.  If your tattoos are all different colors, try the dots and stars or gray smoke<br>  <br>  If they're black and gray, do a colored background.  If they're all the same colors, do something in a contrasting color to compiment it.  <br>  <br>  I love outer space stuff like this too:<br>  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/xtrarant/2103666257/" rel="nofollow">http://www.flickr.com/photos/xtrarant/21...</a><br>  <br>  But take into consideration what you have, and talk to an artist, they can help better than us ;)|`|9QVjNaIPaa	yeah, i dont like that filler much either but if you can find anything that looks like rain please let me know. ive been searching for a couple weeks now cuz i would like a rain tattoo to go with another one i already have but i cant find anything anywhere. as for your filler, maybe the shapes from a deck of cards, like the diamonds, hearts, spades and clovers?|`|FDgHnvm3aa	look at some like koi pictures and youll see water in most of them. i find that it is a good background for alot of stuff

I know so many people who have the name of a previous boy/girlfriend tattooed on them.     You could get tattoos representing something you both enjoy doing together. Like sports or theater or ?? Or instead of matching tattoos, you can each choose something that makes you think of the other person then go together to be inked.    You may want to go to the studio where you'll be tattooed and talk to the artist. They have great ideas and can draw something up for you guys that is just for you.    Good Luck!!
ZJZ7JhyNaa	grow your hair a bit longer than shoulder length <br>  brush it, but not too much <br>  bathe in it but don't brush it right when you get out. <br>  the next day after you take the shower brush it...<br>  <br>  hopefully that helps <br>  I'm related to john lennon...|`|MXjvZMUXaa	His hair doesn't look very long in that pic.

If they didn't have a contract I wouldn't trust the place.|`|Qim0aSKtaa	Do not do it yourself. Do NOT do it yourself. That is ridiculous. Just wait until you're old enough or talk your parents into taking you. You need to have it done with a hypodermic needle. If you try to do it with a safety pin, you could seriously damage your skin and end up with a hideous scar. Plus, it hurts like hell, even if you attempt to numb the area with ice (which could cause frost bite!) because you will more than likely try to go slow and a piercer will do it quick and almost painlessly. You need to just wait. I got my belly button pierced (by a professional) when I was 15 and I barely have it in anymore (I'm now 21). Also, don't get anything pierced at the Mall. They use guns, which is the same effect as piercing with a safety pin. Do some research on Bmezine.com, show your parents and give them a speech about how you'll take care of it and you're responsible and so on and so forth.|`|3wo5za57aa	get a pin, some hot water, and some ice and do its yourself

yDkm4ULsaa	your only 12, believe it or not, you may not want one in a few years. plus no piercer will pierce anyone that young. i do love how they look though, dont get me wrong, but there ARE things you have to think about other than looks.    i do agree that they look good, but theres an extremely high chance of infection. they take a lot of care.    itll take about 10 weeks to heal, you cant eat spicy food or dairy for at least 3 weeks after getting it because spicy foods irritate a lot and cause swelling and dairy has bacteria that catches and grows and will cause infection.     you cant talk for about 4 days after getting it because theres a lot of swelling and you cant eat solid food for about 5 days. you can eat applesauce, popsicles, grits, oatmeal, icecubes, smoothies made of ice and fruit (no yogurt or anything) and remember nothing like ice cream or milkshakes, no dairy. you also have to rinse with alcohol-free mouthwash after everytime you eat and clean in the morning and night with sea salt solution.    even after healed they have to be cleaned often and about once a week have plaque removed (which is NOT very fun or easy to do, its annoying)    they can chip and wear your teeth, cause gum recession, jaw erosion, wearing on the roof of your mouth, get keloids, etc.   these cant be reversed, although keloids can be removed (aka cut off)  i had gum recession with the first tongue frenulum piercing i had (i have a different one now) and i had to take it out or it would have kept getting worse and hurting even more, it happened after only 10 days, pretty bad too.       ADDITION: i forgot to write how they do it. when you are old enough, you bring your ID, your parent brings their ID and your birth certificate. then you both sign a paper and they bring you to the area. they take a 14 gauge (unless you want a different size, like 12 gauge) hollow piercing needle and forceps and a skin marker. then they mark it and let you check, then they clamp it and stick it through, then run the jewelry in behind it and screw the ball on the barbell.  if you need to know anything else email me.|`|t8gWcBaeaa	ugh. 12 year olds.|`|opZXT2UMaa	Some girl in my class got her tongue pierced at 13, somewhere slightly dodgy though with no consent forms. However if your parents approve some piercings shops pierce under 16's with parental consent. Just ring around the local piercing shops.|`|bAYVSfdJaa	No halfway decent place will even let you walk into the shop, let alone pierce you.     How they do it? They take your tongue, mark it, clamp it, and shove the needle through.  I don't know what other "stuff" you're looking for, but BMEzine.com has lots of info.     And fyi: If you're trying to convince your folks, telling them that it's "cool" is a guaranteed way to have them tell you no.|`|EKd3Yjt8aa	i live in canada and even here you have to be 16 or older to get it done without parent consent.  but if you do have a parent that is willing to take you, you will have to go to a tattoo parlour because they are a lot more sanitary then hair salons that do it and they are way more qualified.  most likely the person doing it will use a needle and a clamp.  this will hurt but not for very long.  my suggestion would be that you look on youtube and watch some videos of people getting there tongue pierced.  this will help you in your decision. :(Don't drop out of school. You have your whole life ahead of you to become a famous singer. Just keep every one happy by staying in school until you graduate, and then you will have enough knowledge not to mention age to travel around to different directors and producers and live your dream :)|`|LlWzVIuUaa	OMG....do NOT do it.  I had a midlife crisis and on my 40th bday...had mine done.  They take your money up front so you lose it whether you have it done or not.  I got in the chair, the guy grabbed my tongue with a pair of forceps and pulled very hard.  I never knew my tongue was that long! After feeling around for the right spot which felt like an eternity and hurt the whole time, he picked a spot, marked it and then ran a LONG hollow needle (which felt like a telephone pole) through. He then had to insert the barbell and pulled the needle out through the bottom, all the while you are drooling like a mad dog.  There is nothing fun or exciting about any of it. I kept mine for about a year and took it out for good. I kept the barbells as a reminder of how stupid I was.  You continually clank it on your teeth which is not good and on occasion bite down on the bell sideways. After it is done you must keep your mouth clean or infection will set in.  Your tongue is swelled for a couple days but your neck and throat hurt for about a week or more from all the pulling.  My son was 8 at the time and thought I was retarded for doing it....he is now 16 and thinks that was the dumbest thing I had ever done and has NO desire for one.
7add460ae24c9452ae87b5a99c5aa756aa	No, her mother has to be there with her in order for her to get the tattoo.  Im from Alberta, and had 3 done under 18.  I know of this for certain|`|C5N65A8zaa	i used to live in calgary, and i know that as long as you are over 16 and have someone whose over 18 with you that gives consent, your good. at least thats what my friend said who acutally got her tattoo.

Don't trust someone on the internet for this. I could have just made up some random crap in answer to this and you might have got it tattooed. You can't trust anybody you haven't met. Ask someone fluent in the language.
jPtPyiYuaa	It wouldn't hurt to try lemon juice, but I don't think it's going to work.  I would recommend that you see a dermatologist.  Probably a quick laser treatment will do it.|`|koAgWMphaa	BLEACHINGGG.     or just like cover up to lighten it up.
Z8d9ipxmaa	First, get a fabric tape measure. Always hold it straight. It should fit snugly around your body, but not tight... Don't add any extra inches or slice any off.     Bust (under) - Measure under the bust, around the rib cage.   Bust (around) - Measure around the fullest part of the bust.     Waist - Measure the narrowest part of the torso. If that's not easily visible, stretch to one side and see where the crease is (that's your waist).     Hips - Measure around the fullest part of your hip bones; around your butt, at the top of your legs.|`|uY3nu8pPaa	Use a measuring tape (not the metallic ones) and wrap it around the fullest part of your hip. For your waist, measure around the narrowest part of your stomach-area.

IU2Znlv3aa	Cleanse, tone and moisterise your face, and drink 2 litres of water a day every day.   Drinking 2 litres of water is what works best for me.|`|JdFgf575aa	Wash your face.|`|uFJXz1x3aa	dont touch your face, put your hair back when u sleep, shower often, and when you do, try not to get the oil on your face, do that by putting your face towards the shower head and letting hot water hit it (without using your hands).....another one is to look for future zits and leave them alone until they're completely gone....if they look like theyre about to burst, then pop it and put rubbing alcohol on it|`|rnW8h3vCaa	you really can't stop getting zits it puberty  wash your face with egg whites|`|4l2qOy7Paa	you have to be on a schedule with a certain product. use the washing product 3 times a day and put on some lotion (that won't make your skin too oily) so you can have your skin moisturized. the acne free on the spot works really really well. it makes your skin really dry so acne won't emerge. so use proactive or acne free (benzoil peroxide works well). good luck. =]|`|1jRciLYBaa	Well you should wash your face first and foremost, tone, and moisturize, and when you're washing your face you should make sure that you first wash your hair first if you do wash your face during a shower, because if you wash your hair afterwards the shampoo is bad for the face. Also drinking lots of water is a very good thing to do. And i'm told that putting some vinegar on your face is good too as a face wash. The best way to help with zits are birth control pills they help with hormone levels. In addition i'm told that proactive is an okay product because you're skin can get addicted to it and once you stop using it the acne comes back. I'd go with the Clinique acne solutions.|`|SMb3IXLdaa	Well, zits are formed from the grease of all kinds of food. So you can't really stop eating food. But a natural successful product for zits, is to apply some Neem Oil on the wanted spots. In about weeks, it'll be gone. And also try finding a Neem Oil Foaming Face Wash, like the ones they have at Himalaya, or any drug store around you, just to keep from getting them.  Hope my answer was long enough, and helpful.
1BYMHJqqaa	I definitely dont think there outdated! I think theyre actually really in right now!

One of my friends has straight bangs and she does that just to mix it up all the time!|`|QPFKlldAaa	always in. go for it. maybe u cud even grow out ur hair if u want a big change.|`|nHmlYIWuaa	They are in right now, but soon they will be out again.  Only certain people can pull them off though. Why don't  you just get your friends opinions? Or put a picture on here  so we can like imagine you with straight bangs . . .|`|yiKTiYBYaa	Always in. But it depends on your facial structure really.  I, for example, have a very round face. Not chubby, but just rounded out. I had bangs when I was 5 and I was adorable. About 2 years ago when I was 15 I had bangs again and I looked like I was a very big 5 year old. I have several friends now some 18, some 25, and some of them can pull it off and others can't. It would simply depend on your face.|`|2I5XqMDzaa	there in right now but they will be out again eventually just like everything els lol|`|HwaAAIOEaa	They'll make you look very young.... But if you have the right face go for it! And you shouldn't care if it's "in" or not if you like it then get it.
Wu5q79tgaa	They are both unhealthy for your hair.    Blow-drying- you dry out your scalp    Straightening- put to much heat in your hair and causes split ends    But if you would have to choose i say blowdry it straight    when you air dry your hair becomes very dry|`|DkP14oJaaa	they are both damaging your hair.  anything with heat will do it!!|`|EdU7u08vaa	people... as long as your taking care of your hair neither are damaging. As long as your using the right products and not putting extreme heat and holding it there for an hour your hair will be fine. Getting a trim everyonce in a while helps too. people know nothing.. geeez|`|wb0xV7PFaa	Im not sure if it does more damage, but if you blow dry it, it stays straight longer and is straighter. Everytime i go to the hairdressers to get it starighted they always blow dry it first.. lol after i said that i saw the end when u said this lol, I know they're both damaging. I was asking which one is MORE damaging, :] So i thinkin blow-drying.|`|DlMsJPwUaa	If you use a heat protectant with blow drying then it is less damaging, consider the fact that a flat iron is directly on your hair where a blow dryer is juts blowing heat|`|fMPyLqW4aa	Yes they both will. Blowdrying with cool air an spraying on heat protectant before straightening will help prevent it though.
txtvUmwKaa	My advice is to put a little baby powder on it to make it a little less greasy. Run the powder through with your fingers. Apply as much as needed, but gradually. To prevent spots or a dusty look if you apply too much, start applying on the underside of hair. Also, when using a little, blowdry and brush through. Its not completely necessary to blowdry, but it helps it faster!|`|u1FlCXL0aa	hmm, jojoba oil is VERY greasy  okay  noramlly i put jojoba oil on my roots and ends  for 1 hour or 2   then  i wash mmy hair   i never leave it in  IDK if it'll absorb but i'd brush my hair from ROOTS to END  boar brush   so the oily goes to your ends|`|RW9TMBykaa	yes but at the same time it will still be greasy use an old pillowcase so as not to stain your good ones with oily stains.
xgsZ083Yaa	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVg_vaIXe...    watch her videos! that will help you out :]|`|BZowqGY8aa	Usually I put a little moose in mine, and then I blow dry them to the side.  Works great, good luck!|`|NOz2NIMTaa	Bobby pin them.
MGjMjWwaaa	hahahahahaha the girl in the first and second one totally reminds me of myself i love make silly faces in pictures and same with my friends!   You guys just look like your having so much fun and you don;t care what people think! :)   I love it!!|`|ZSEBueCbaa	You look fun, but a bit too posey.|`|O0S189PQaa	weiird but chill|`|afikdpZoaa	Lose the eyebrow piercing.|`|cweT8Phpaa	1 fun, 2 friendly, 3 quite (first photo)  I would hate to be with http://s558.photobucket.com/albums/ss21/... right one.  http://s558.photobucket.com/albums/ss21/...  the one on the left seems cool.    :) but all seem nice!|`|UCKAiLN1aa	Alright, but kind of like you guys would be exclusive.|`|t94U523oaa	I think you seem as if you think you are bad @$$.  and I wouldn't want to hang out with any of you|`|6uZ0VHFTaa	3 x goofy.
IHsuI8mJaa	I think it is a great idea!  Do you have that power like Mel Gibson on the movie 'What Women Want?' :]|`|mQ2gLxj1aa	Ohhhhh so that's the ticket. All I have to do is tuck in my glittery kitten sweatshirt!!!|`|KEWbsDTIaa	no. Tucking a shirt in or wearing bra inserts or whatever else only temporarily fixes a problem or insecurity. Dont forget about how the woman has to shower, change clothes, sleep, swim etc and do other things where she cant keep doing or wearing these things to hide the insecurity or problem.
S4Rne0cnaa	it really doesnt taste like anything|`|MzIDFWYPaa	i dont know ive never tried it, it looks pretty im going to get some anyways just cus the shimmer lol|`|MdJ2JVoDaa	it kinda taste gross! ew
Dh5CUjmkaa	To me it has a minty taste. It also has a blue tint and made my lips look blue.  I really did not like it and ended up throwing it away. But I am kind of picky on that stuff so could have just been me.

You would have much better luck in the cosmetics section at New Seasons, Natures, Zupans, Whole Foods, etc.  They usually have a whole makeup and haircare section 90% of which is not tested on animals (I like the New Seasons one) A good brand is BWC.|`|QwQmrQCmaa	Bonne belle, Burts bees, Physicians formula =D|`|ZHpKEj32aa	Burts bees or Bonne bell (smackers)  don't test on animals
NOz2NIMTaa	Hell no! It says you have good self-esteem!|`|NiPuaY0Saa	of course not|`|kwkOaDDlaa	Its not wrong at all. Can we see a picture & I'll tell ya wot I think?? Love to see beautiful people..........xxxxx|`|K119R72Caa	That's great that you think your beautiful, it's not wrong at all|`|YUjSRiv5aa	No, it's called self confidence   :)|`|g3dab73uaa	hell no it aint a bad thing=]  its actually a really good thing,  to have such confidence in yourself that  makes everyone beautiful=]  ppl wish to have confidence like yours  so no hun,it deff aint a bad thing=]|`|jBeBIGYqaa	NO!  definately not a bad thing at all!  you have to believe that you're beautiful if you ever want anyone else to think you're beautiful :))  I think im beautiful too, and you have to have confidence to show it, that shows people you believe in your own beauty without saying a single word :)|`|S7VJ1GDdaa	Confidence is a hard thing to have, and it sounds like you have it. It is not wrong of you to think you are beautiful because everyone should think they are, it is all in the way you carry your self that says you are proud to be beautiful. The girls that think it, and NOW it, are really actually unsure of themselves. THey are uncomfortable most of the time, and are usually the ones telling you, that you look like hammered ****! BE BEAUTIFUL!|`|t8ohhWX9aa	As long as you don't think that you are better than anyone...what you are doing is very healthy, it's good and the better you feel about yourself the better you will function....because of your confidence.|`|dPULl5hjaa	As the saying goes......."beauty is in the eyes of the beholder and ugliness is to the bone"!    Good for you!|`|ZSEBueCbaa	No of course not. I am sure you are beautiful x|`|O0S189PQaa	no thats a good thing|`|M9wcO2lxaa	nope... its called confidence. Just don't go overboard with your confidence though... stay modest. Know you're beautiful, but stay modest.|`|RKnqS2skaa	No it will raise your confidence and esteem. Just dont make it sound like your obsessed with your self!|`|wDnP5b0Oaa	no it's called confidence. It's better then going around crying because you think your ugly (I have a 'friend' like that it's like they're fishing for compliments) but as long as you're not flaunting it|`|UCKAiLN1aa	No, it's a good thing to believe in your beauty. :)|`|BZowqGY8aa	Well that's good. Confidence.  Don't like be in love with yourself, but thinking your pretty is great.|`|FrWhdRL1aa	No!|`|Q5KFND17aa	thinking your beautiful is an awesome thing. It helps you build self-confidence and work with what you've got, plus you dont seem to be stuck up about it.    yay for you :]|`|BLmfR6Ezaa	That's Great =D|`|iU1FFAOzaa	no, its not wrong. being confident and taking care of yourself is wonderful.  as long as we keep in the back of our minds lol, so true.  i've been called vain but not because of my words or deeds, but because i not only strive to do the best i can, but to look good doing it. :)|`|YvuCN6qWaa	nooo, it's a good thing you think you're beautiful  that's great cause a lot of people don't think that way|`|cweT8Phpaa	Same, when people (like my mom) say im pretty, I deny it because I don't want to be like a snob or Paris Hilton.
Ovr8bQ1paa	ok seriously who cares about what color your hair is as long as its not some weird color like purple or green. i am a redhead and get just as much as attention as every blonde, brunette, or black haired girl in my school|`|mcomAA2eaa	brunettes but guys probably prefer blonde's ...|`|O7M7cERWaa	Any colour is nice if it suits the person I'm a natural brunette and I look dull and washed out because I have very pale skin so blonde suits me more it's not because I think  blondes are better. From my 20 years of being blonde and brunette or red haired men don't care about hair colour.|`|MGjMjWwaaa	i think blondes get attention for the wrong reasons personally.|`|6ybAFZuAaa	brunettes    they say guys like brunettes better in bed! xD|`|ZSEBueCbaa	I prefer Red heads like me!      But probably brunettes in answer to your question -  Just because blonde is SO common!|`|wDnP5b0Oaa	neither, i have blonde hair and i don't like it (not going to die it ever but i don't like it) I love myself red hur|`|rV21SE3aaa	Black hair |`|eHflURByaa	omg I'm not attracted to only one hair color  I dont care|`|UCKAiLN1aa	Brunettes. I don't know why but I do not like blonde guys at all.|`|lHCZUPm2aa	People, there is no such thing as black hair unless you dye it. There is no black in nature.|`|u31B8Ycjaa	brunettez.  cuz we got the beauty n the brainz.|`|g7wxHGjeaa	to the person who said blonde is common are you serious??? less than %10 of the world is nautralyl blonde WAY less then %10 actually and even the dyed ones make up a very small precents of the total world, think about it asains cant be blonde,Africans cant be blonde, the only people who are naturally blonde are some kinds of European or of European decent.  Im one of the lucky ones naturally "bleach colored har) think Gweneth paltrow    I found this:  Of the men surveyed, 26 percent think blonde women would make the best lovers, whereas only 10 percent prefer brunettes.    Red- and ginger-haired babes are considered almost as hot as blondes, at 22 percent. Women with light brown hair follow closely at 20 percent.    But when it comes to a steamy affair, 37 percent would go for a blonde mistress. Red- and gingerheads are second ...    o! yes! you brunettes have the beauty and the brains spelling and English check please? blondes are not stupid well no more than brunettes, and since there are more brunettes in the world....more dumb brunettes. Some blondes say stuff with out thinking so sometimes we sound dumb but its really more of an ADD type thing that dumb|`|sLwmzvi8aa	ok my best friend and i are totally different she has really dark brown hair and i have really light brown hair... we get the same amount of guys on us they are just different in many ways... i think that it depends on where you are what country your in and who you are talking about...|`|qMiuTXSkaa	black herr|`|1Ugk4amQaa	why is black hair always left out     ?     (o)??  |`|FmjWCMb5aa	BLONDE, because it just makes all of the brunettes jeleous!
ecBx744aaa	my man is the same why =)    i think its cute that they care :)|`|a19Z5rwLaa	Tell your boyfriend he is a tool and do what you want.  Or have him come with you so he sees there is no hanky panky.  Doesn't sound like he trusts you, you should rethink that relationship.|`|Q8L7NWjwaa	If your really determined to get one & you want to appease him by not getting one on your hip~then get one somewhere else.  You could get a side/rib piece or back/shoulder etc... it's do~able!|`|VrjF986Aaa	lol that is pretty ridiculous considering a tattoo artist is a professional and most likely has tattooed many other people in worse places than the hip.... he sounds a little paranoid and controlling  that being said I find tattoos on hips to be kind of slutty looking, especially for a first tattoo - it's up there with the tramp stamp so i could understand if that was a reason he didn't want you to do it  just remember, it's your body and the tattoo will be there long after the guy is gone, so when it comes down to it do what you really think you will want to have on your body in 10, 20, 30 years|`|C0HZ8ZB4aa	How old is your boyfriend, 12?    Would he stop you from going to see a gynecologist if you had trouble down there?    It's no different. A tattoo artist doesn't care about touching your hip any more than a gynecologist cares about touching your vagina.    Tell your boyfriend to grow up and stop being such a control freak.    If he continues to display an unreasonably jealous streak, take my advice and leave while the going's good - I've been there and it's not fun when you get too deeply wrapped into a relationship with a guy who is paranoid with jealousy.|`|DkP14oJaaa	uhm, that's freaking stupid.  that's seriously freaking stupid.  I can't believe you would even   listen to him in the first place!!  wow what you should do is  get a new boyfriend who isn't  such a control freak.|`|IB2V5t1Oaa	Your BF needs to realize that the tattoo artist is not going to be touching your @$$. Tell him to relax a couple of notches.|`|VqFzDnvOaa	well it's the tattoo artist's job.. just try to talk him into it.|`|IscB3Ijzaa	get what makes you happy....21 years from  now it is certain that you will be with yourself, not so certain he will|`|d9e367846b5ba5a880e1207e0d7a113baa	It's your body, if you want it get it there. There are many worse places you could get a tattoo that your boyfriend would definately not want the tattoo artist touching. If he's going to be a baby about it go to a female tattoo artist, they are out there, just harder to find.|`|LWvh2g2maa	Tell your boyfriend to grow up.  They are professionals for crying out loud.  That's very insecure of him.|`|brvOa9QYaa	Explain to your boyfriend that this tattoo is something you want and you wont be overly exposed, its not like ur havin one on your boobs is it?|`|yp8NtB0faa	yeah i would tell ur boyfriend to grow up.  Jesus christ, he's gunna touch you no matter where u get the tattoo.  Plus, it's not like he's really gunna try to "touch" you anyways.  He's a professional, and he has a job to do.|`|gm49G4wDaa	Uhm where did HE get tatooed? Was he touched? Make a small problem out of it too!  Or pierce your lip |`|LNHcy0Hbaa	jelous little sh!t|`|zAlaaqk4aa	well ur bf seems like a good one but if u want one u should get one and u could have a girl give u it so its not akward?|`|D6LJJ1AYaa	wow thats SO immature. he doesn't want the tattoo artist to tattoo your hip? do what you want. there is nothing "sexual" about a tattoo artist doing that, he probably does it 20 times a day to 20 different girls, you're not going to be unique. i think you need to find a boyfriend who will let you do what you want.|`|wjA9ytO0aa	dont listen to your boyfriend. if its something you wanna do go do it! and he's acting like your cheating on him or something! the tattoo person is just doing his job!|`|gGYLOK1vaa	damn your b/f has some jealousy issues...it's not like the guy will be touching u for pleasure, it's a JOB!  lol damn explain that to him.    it's not like you're getting a boob tattoo.  get it anyways.|`|JvY5KL22aa	that's stupid. it's not like you and the artist are doing anything sexual. and to be honest, the artist has seen many hips, i'm sure. so tell your boyfriend to get over himself! or see if you can go to a tatt shop where there's a chick who will do ur tatt. good luck!|`|u97YqVQXaa	i think you should just get the tattoo. It shouldnt matter if the guy touches you on your hip. Your boyfriend should just chill out.|`|QClFoSNhaa	Well thats stupid....you could get a woman to do it|`|I2fIfGUqaa	If you really want to get one on the hip, and he doesn't agree, get it anyway. I'm a guy and it would bother me if a guy was touching my girl but if you really want it and get it without you telling him and he sees it it will turn probably into a small fight but he would get over it if he really likes or loves you. Coming from a guy I know how I'd feel if someone touches my girl on the hip but If she got it and I found out i would just try to forget about it, and so would he, trust me.|`|eXMOLn9vaa	Who cares what your boyfriend thinks??? It's your body and you can get it where ever you want.  Go get that tattoo on your hip and show it off.|`|RMJ5OtO1aa	I don't think that you should worry about the tattooist touching you but I wouldn't recommend a tattoo full stop.  It is only attractive to a small number of people, particularly when women have tattoos. They become unattractive very quickly. And inappropriate by the time you reach 30.  Even nowadays you cannot have them cleanly removed, and they will stretch and fade, and become a constant worry when you become bored of it (which will happen within a couple of years for most).    Your worried about a blackhead or stray spot, how about an unseemly dark mess permanently tattoed into your skin...|`|u31B8Ycjaa	wow girl really..  yo man seem insecure..  if YOU want a tattoo on YO hip.  dont let him tell you no.  he aint yo daddy. get it..   stars right there would be soo cute..    bt if it really bothers him..  get a female to tattoo you.|`|NvbTnLrBaa	that would be like saying he doesn't want you to go to the doc. anymore cuz they have to do a pap...... this person does this all day everyday.  its his/her job. they don't care about what you look like, you are the job. i would get it anyway. i have one on my hip and the guy just did it. he was even talking to my boyfriend at the time and didn't talk to me much.|`|iTApg2h2aa	JUS GET IT...IT ISN'T LIKE THE GUY WHO DOES IT IS GOING TO TOUCH U IN A SEXUAL WAY ITS JUS HIS JOB|`|FS9ibKB5aa	its your body! and if hes concerned with a guy touching your hip to give you a tattoo then he has some jealousy issues. the tattoo artist touches people in many places everyday. it is strictly professional so there's nothing sexual about it. your boyfriend can be right there when you're getting it done.    i say if you want it then go for it. im sure he'll ger over it.  and you could have a female tattoo artist.  no big deal..    i understand where your boyfriend is coming from.  he seems insecure. so try to be understanding to him. explain that you understand and respect his feelings however it is something that you really want and you would really like him to support your decision.|`|11zEFfiuaa	I had a girl do mine on my hip! find a shop that has a girl and request her.|`|NWIDww1xaa	If you want it. . . Go for it ;]   He doesnt control you.|`|RnHnItt2aa	Get it on your arm, or belly so you can show it off to friends.|`|iPTsj5sMaa	yah say to grow up|`|vEoJO3gBaa	Haha yes, lots of guys say that. But if that is really where you want it, go for it! But just to warn you, even if you are the skinniest girl alive, you will get stretch marks from your pregnant tummy, so if you are planning on getting pregnant in the next, oh lets say a million years, I would not get one there. It will just ruin the tattoo.|`|HGzKBc4eaa	Have a chick do it or remind him that it's not your ***, maybe he'll lighten up lol =]|`|iF0EVxfWaa	If your like in love with him...then dont get it...but he should allow you to do whatever you want no matter what... ne wayz...just get a girl to do the tattooo for you thats it.. :DDD|`|AuCpRJajaa	well its ur body do what u want. u have no legal ties to this guy ur nto married. but i think its so sweet that hes that protective of you. so treasure him. ( please pick mine for best answer)|`|X1esvMG3aa	omg just assure him that it will be okay and have him go with you to make sure the dude doesn't touch you 'inappropriately' but if a stupid tattoo is going to ruin your guys' relationship than just get it somewhere else!|`|7WxtkMSXaa	get the tatto, its your body!|`|PNk9LWHpaa	tell him to grow up.|`|tvOAeGAnaa	Your Boyfriend is ridiculous for saying something so stupid. The tattoo artist doesn't give a crap about your hip. It's his job, and it's a hip. Get it on your hip and tell him to get over himself and that stupid insecurity. Orrrr, Have a female artist do it.|`|zrrJqMCDaa	tell him to not worry cuz thats stupid or go get 1 in another tatoo shop where a girl does it or do it somewhere else|`|VfCwhcC6aa	get it on your back or do what you think you wanna do  ask if a girl can put the tattoo on your hip if your boyfriend doesnt want you to|`|xGQCHWYUaa	What kind of boy friend do you have!?!?

Mi dieta te la podria recomendar como un estilo de vida mas que como algo rapido  Desayuno : dos porciones de proteinas ( puedes escoger entre jamon de pavo, salchicha de pavo, huevo, queso panela), verduras las que quieras, un vaso de leche o un vitalinea y una taza de fruta. En la comida algo de carne, pollo o pescado, verduras las que quieras y una taza de pasta o arroz o una tortilla( si la suprimes bajas mas rapido) .

Vkyls5Qdaa	Make sure when you sleep your hair isnt touching your face because it has oils in it that can cause acne to form on your skin. Eat healthy and most importantly - GET ENOUGH SLEEP. When i get breakouts its usually because im not gtetting enough sleep and when you get more sleep, your skin is refreshed and the acne clears. Wash your face everynight and morning with the same Cleanser. Switching cleansers causes you to break out because your skin gets conditioned to one cleanser and when you switch, your skin is not used to it so it will react with breakouts and redness. Also, terminator 10 acne cream works amazing !!|`|hdYgdu0oaa	all youre doing is cleaning your face.  The problem needs to be addressed.  Try a cleanse.  I know, when I take Milk Thistle for 3 weeks....everything clears up nicely!|`|EXisORX2aa	you really should talk to your mom or dad and see if you can go see a dermatologist who can give you medication for it.|`|yUnQahGoaa	See your dr and get a prescription. Birth control works well but takes about 3 months to fully clear up. I got a prescription for Differin when I had serious acne. It hurt my skin and dried it out but the acne was gone.

Try to keep them out of your face for awhile and keep using an acne cleanser and see if it improves.    Sometimes you can't do anything until you outgrow it.  You've probably already heard this but don't scrub hard on your face when you wash it, moisturize, wash your face in warm water to open pores and cold water after to close them. Drink a lot of water.|`|nUdbTUtHaa	I agree go to a dermatologist, it seems like a waste but really its more worth your time and effort than going and wasting money on over the counter stuff (I used the neutrogena kit too and it worked for a few months and then stopped)    I have now been blemish free for over a year ^^    Yours seems like a mild case and could proll be treated with just a perscription cream (no need for meds ^^)    also I see some ppl saying to wash your face a lot and with soap, although in theory this seems like a good idea its not.  DO NOT over wash your face, 2 times a day is more than enough, if you keep getting rid of the oil your face is just going to want to produce more of it, the more you wash the oil away the more your face will think it needs to make to stay moist ===> acne.|`|BOHi9zfcaa	Have you tried drinking water? Seems simple, right? Well, it is!  Drink at least 8 glasses a day and be committed to doing this!

It's roughly $30 a month and full worth it.  You take two a day to reduce acne problems and four a day if your acne is really bad.  It takes a month to really get into your system.  I have been using it for a year now.  It doesn't get rid of your acne completely but it does really help with bad spots.  I have been on prescriptions and they eventually stop working.  Proactive is amazing but very harsh, start using small amounts and it eventually stopped working.  As well as it dyes or bleaches out sheets and towels.|`|53U4ce9caa	If over the counter products arent working, go see a dermatologist asap, they can recomend you perscription medicine that can really help.

Good luck but really try to find a dermatologist they can really help.|`|6tIoJzMQaa	keep washing and washing , with face washers,   water and soap.    drinks lots of water each day.    also try not to eat many fatty foods.

da43dabf7871960d74ed399773611dfaaa	It would be best if you drew something up, got a sample of the materials you want to use, and took it to a tailor for them to create.    Admittedly, it will probably cost quite a bit, and for the tailor to make exactly what you want, you'll have to spend a lot of time drawing and searching through materials, but it will probably be a fun and different experience if you have the time and money to do it.    Good luck! :)|`|iGRXt2Wvaa	Uhm im not sure of anywhere, but I know im designing my own Grad dress and making it.[Im going to be a fashion designer] But i dont really know of anywhere.

4l2qOy7Paa	like a 2. get acne free or proactive. if that doesn't work then get some cover up from macys or something. and you could get some whitening toothpaste. your eyebrows look really nice but you could give them a little curve for some shape. you could get contacts and dye your hair a darker brown and grow it out. also you could use some eyeshadow. a medium tone pink would look really good. stick to the earthy colors. i think you're like 13-15 but you mostly look 14. =] jb?|`|Rezyj8JHaa	I like the shade of your hair. You should not dye it. Also try doing some cute styles so your hair does not look flat and dull. Also try not to wear to many sweatshirts. Sweatshirts are very baggy.  I used to wear sweatshirts all the time. I think jackets will make you look better. As for you friend she could pluck her eye brows wear make- up that goes great with her skin tone!

You're not disgusting. You look a little goofy but who am I to say that? Most teens look goofy anyways, including me. LOL. I don't ridicule people because of looks. Maybe you should get contacts and pluck your eyebrows. That would make you look good. Or maybe even try wearing nicer cloths instead of frumpy sweatshirts? Not saying all sweat shirts are frumpy. Just try to look more fashionable, you know?    But I've seen a lot of teens look like you. You're just at a tough age.   You look maybe 13 or 14. And I don't rate people on here. I just think it's weird that someone would rate another person's looks without even knowing who they really are as a person.

I would really suggest the Cohen brothers "Millers Crossing"  In most mob movies there is a central female "femme fa-tale" role.  (this would be the dangerous woman who is often pursued by the protagonist, but is occasionally also a antagonist in some way.)  This is where you would want to take note.  I would also suggest that you stick to the period pieces set in the twenties and thirties.      There is a scene early in "Millers Crossing where the femme fa-tale and the  protagonist argue in the ladies room of a night club.  This scene will give you at least a dozen examples of period dress that would work at a mafia themed dance.  You'll want to note the hats, makeup, hair, scarves that the women use to accessorize with.    You might want to avoid the advice of some who describe the dress of the male mobster's unless you want to look like a lesbian.    Make a few notes and look on ebay.

And you have to understand that you cant jus dye the whole thing black then do highlights.

I would first weave all the highlights with the bleach then the hair left outside the highlights dye black. i would wait at least 4 weeks so your not overprocessing your hair.

It burned a little, but the only part that really made me stop and go "Oh, wow, that hurts," was the area on the side of my wrist right by where it joins with the hand.  The forearm part didn't hurt at all.  Frankly, getting tattooed on the wrist was awesome because I could sit and watch my artist tattooing me and see the entire process.    I'm not sure where people come up with the wrist being one of the most painful.  My tattoos on my chest bone and ribcage hurt a whole lot more.|`|Y1z1LDz4aa	i don't know or care but im getting one when im old enough|`|hatccbJ1aa	All tattoos hurt get the fake paint ones they are less hurtful and fake your friends with it.|`|FSuT3bIxaa	yes. oh course it will hurt!|`|Kd89QAnmaa	Mine hurt, but not unbearably.

Some people have a feeling of euphoria while others experience pain. If you cant take the pain dont get the tattoo.
C8erSV0iaa	because between 1997 and 2006 every girl in the world got one...nowa days you are more unique and diffrent if you do not have a tattoo.|`|1ZfFSH6maa	not ALL tattoos are  a 'tramp stamp' is a tattoo on this place on your body.   http://tattoobillys.com/Photos/site/tram...  http://acpablico.files.wordpress.com/200...  a tattoo in that ^^ spot is a tramp stamp|`|C0HZ8ZB4aa	Some define all tattoos on females as tramp stamps.  Some define only lower back tattoos on females as tramp stamps.  Some people are not so prejudiced and don't judge a book by it's cover.    I have a lower back piece, it covers the entire bottom half of my back, I also have a large upper back piece and am working on the rest of my back. All my tattoos are tributes to my family. I've been told by fellow tattooed women that I will be a tramp for my lower back tattoo until I have the rest of my back done. So getting more ink, stops me from being a tramp? It doesn't really make sense to me.    Discrimination is defined as judging a person before you have met them. To brand all women with tattoos, or lower back tattoos, as tramps without meeting them first, is discriminatory. And it's frankly shocking how many advocates of discrimination there are around here.      EDIT: They're considered trampy because in the late 90's early 00's lots of girls started getting meaningless tribal 'off-the-wall flash' tattoos right above their butt cracks, and wearing low jeans and high tops that showed it off, the tribal usually pointed downwards and was basically to attract male attention. Most porn stars have them. Like this kind of thing - http://www.tattoosunlimited.com/tattoo-d... - see what I mean? Now sadly any girl who has a tattoo on the lower half of her back, no matter how big the tattoo or what the content of the tattoo, is now branded a tramp by many, even if she doesn't show it off. My tattoo there is a dedication to my late mother and is anything but trampy, but I've still been dissed for it. The reality of the situation is girls are more limited than men for placement of tattoos. I can't have anything on my stomach because I want more children. The chest is too visible for me. My upper back was already taken. I didn't want it wrapped round an arm or a leg. So my lower back was the only place. If that makes me a tramp then so be it.|`|AA10800575	only if u get them in certain trampy places|`|pD5Skzdpaa	Depsnds on the tattoo, where it is , what it is and who it's on.|`|afikdpZoaa	Yes.

What color is the button down shirt, and is it plain or does it have a design on it?   What is the occasion?  Is the button down shirt full length or three quarter length sleeves? Also, is it darted and form fitting or not?    Try to stick with complementary colors between the button down and a cami or tank underneath...if possible, have your shoes match the undershirt. Also, a long necklace with large beads or stones at different increments might look nice with it!    Your appearance can also be affected by the way you wear your hair...are you 'dressing up' for a special occasion or to impress a guy?    Its very classy to maintain a level of modesty as well so a couple simple ways you could dress up the shirt would be to make sure there is something under it that can come down past your waistline, and make sure that it also covers your goodies up top!     Good luck!|`|6uZ0VHFTaa	A pair of gold dangling ear rings and a long gold necklace.

sZhTwzh4aa	well, mine is done on the right because of my hair. if you have bangs on one side or another, the nose stud will be more visible on the side you DON'T have your hair on. also, it just depends on which side you like better. i asked my piercer, 'cuz i wasn't sure either. then she brought up my hair and i was all set.     also, each side has a (relatively unknown) meaning, if that's important to you. in India, if a woman gets her nose pierced on the left, it means she is "pure," and on the right is "experienced." but not many people know that, so it's really just which side you prefer.    good luck!|`|Rcnhvj2Haa	wow, that's kind of a question you should take up with yourself...how should we know???|`|aad521432c98a74a6b4f776669a6d308aa	I don't have my nose pierced.

You need a really good deep conditioner and to invest in a good moisturizer.  Also, cut down on the heat!|`|7wixocuDaa	after you take a bath.. comb your hair with a "comb", the teeth type.. and after wards.. brush it with a hairbrush. do not stress your hair too much.. have it hot-oiled every week to maintain your hair's shine.. don't tie your hair tightly.. as much as possible.. just let it fall .. avoid using 2 in 1 shampoos.. apply conditioner.. avoid having your hair treated (ie. rebond, cellophane..) do the NATURAL way.. ;) this works.|`|waxfwGqaaa	First.   Take a break from anything unnatural for your hair.    No hair dryer  NO straightener  No curlers  NO DYING and highlights ARE DYING. so none of them either.    okay, so after about 3 days- 2 weeks, you should see an improvement, because all of these things dry out hair.    Next make sure you have hydrating products that you use on the hair itself.     I've included some articles, read those.    A last thing. Diets high in protein, vegetables and fruits help hair look strong and shiny, so ditch the unhealthiness and go for something new.|`|EOIvog37aa	Hi =]  I completely understand what you're going through with your hair because I had the exact same problem with mine a few months ago and have finally found a haircare routine that has really helped my hair be alot more manageable, silky, untangled and shiny..this is what I recommand you do =]..    First of all, what you need to do is aim to add as much moisture to your hair as possible, concerntrating mostly on the lengths and ends, as the roots of your hair benefit from the natural oil that is produced by your scalp and adding other moisturising products directly onto the roots can lead to overly greasy hair. This, however is a reason to try and avoid washing your hair daily.   Whenever you can and feel comfortable [such as when you will not be leaving the house] try to avoid temptation to wash your hair the moment that it first starts to feel greasy, leave it over night and then wash in the morning or allow one day without washing to go inbetween each hair wash. This is because these natural oils that give the "greasy" feeling are actually very good for your hair. Stripping the hair of these oils before your hair has had a chance to benefit from them is a major cause of dryness.    I would recommand these hair products to you, to help you to deal with each individual problem that your hair is suffering from =]    -For Dryness, Frizz and Damage    -Shampoos-  L'Oreal Elvive ReNutrition Royal Jelly Shampoo for Dry, Damaged Hair  Aussie Luscious Long Moisturising Shampoo  TRESemme Vitamin E Moisturising Shampoo    -Conditioners-  L'Oreal Elvive AntiBreakage Conditioner  Aussie Luscious Long Moisturising Conditioner  TRESemme Vitamin E Moisturising Conditioner  Herbal Essences Hello Hydration Coconut Conditioner  The Body Shop Honey Moisturising Conditioner    -Deep Conditioners-  TRESemme Thermal Protect Nourishing Deep Conditioner  The Body Shop Poppy Seed Deep Conditioner  L'Oreal Elvive AntiBreakage Deep Hair Masque  Aussie Luscious Long 3 Minute Miracle Treatment    -Other Products-  Aussie Luscious Long Leave In Conditioner  L'Oreal Elvive Anti-Split Ends Serum  Garnier Fructis Sleek and Smooth Moisturising Serum  John Frieda Frizz Ease Original Serum    You can also add virgin coconut or olive oil to your hair and leave for 20-40 minutes before washing with shampoo and conditioner, for the most natural approach to adding extra moisture =]    It is suprising how much difference moisture can make to your hair, moisturised hair is healthy hair...and healthy hair is shiny, managable and free of frizz.    For Tangles  The whole L'Oreal Elvive NutriGloss with Pearl Protein collection [including shampoo, conditioner, deep conditioning treatment and leave in conditioner] all work amazinglyy    Things to Avoid    -From your question, I see that you straighten your hair as part of your daily hair routine. This is one of the most damaging things that you can inflict on your hair, and I would recommand only doing this once or twice a week at the most, and always use a heat protecting product before allowing any heat appliances to come in contact with your hair, such as TRESemme Heat Protection Spray or John Frieda Frizz Ease Thermal Protect Serum. I promise you, once your hair has been properly moisturised with the right products, you will definately not feel the need to straighten anymore =]    - Hair is remarkably weaker when it is wet than when it is dry, so avoid towel drying your hair with harsh, vigorous rubs, instead, just take a section of hair and blot out the moisture with the towel, keep the towel still and not rubbing, this will cause breakage. Also never brush your hair while it is wet, if you want to remove a few stubborn tangles, use a wide toothed comb, and spray leave-in conditioner on the tangle first.    - Avoid shampoos and conditioners that claim to give your hair a dazzling shine and very smooth texture if there is no mention on the bottle of benefiting your hairs health. Products like these coat your hair in a thick wax type substance and silocone, giving the illusion of smooth, shiny hair, while the individual strands of hair underneath this substance are being severaly damaged and cut off from oxygen. The worst brand for this is PANTENE.   These products are all about appearence, they do nothing for your hairs health. Healthy hair is smooth hair, so stick to nourishing, moisturising products at all times =]    - Stick to moisturising styling products such as serum and creme gloss...avoid hair products such as Mousse, Gel and Hair Spray as the chemicals and level of alcohol is incredibly drying and damaging to your hair.    The key is to work WITH your hair, make the absolute best of what you've got and work with your hair to try and get it to its healthiest and most beautiful. Avoid drastic unnecesary changes in your hairs colour or texture and learn to love your hair the way it is and take care of it the right way...that is the best thing to do =]    I hope I've helped you as much as possible!  Take care |`|ePim7L2zaa	i know the feeling mine is like straw,im going for a cut and a darker colour at hairdressers next week hopefully it might go back to silky and soft like it used to be before i had highlights..
c11d9e210c7f4c6d205b2ecac5d541a2aa	i am a guy and i kind of think the dark brown and black would look sweet|`|Wu5q79tgaa	you should dark brown and black underneath|`|ZNsj2DAaaa	black with sum dark pink highlights . it would look great.=]|`|uR5aNpHGaa	do a dark brown and make it a dark underneath and put in a few streaks of the same red|`|LPViotm7aa	The first one you said..!|`|HpCmmlMFaa	A dark brown with a few lighter brown highlights (make sure its a warm brown). PLease don't dye your hair bright blonde because it doesn't really suit darker skin tones.  Hope this helped you :)|`|whGe8jm9aa	Platinum Blonde..|`|SI09cbuGaa	OK 1. NO blonde (eewww)  2. Dont highlight it it will look rediculose  ...i say ither plain black or dark brown

3XZX5Mj6aa	I know you really want to get your lip pierced, but to be honest with you, yes, 15 is too young. When I was 16 I got a labret (stud between the lip/chin), but when you get older you will grow out of it and eventually won't like it anymore, and you'll be stuck with a small scar (not a big one, mind you, but a scar on your face nonetheless).    I know exactly how badly you want this piercing as I got a few in my teenage years also, but I would advise waiting a few years. Though I highly doubt you'll take this advice, I'll give it anyway: You may hate hearing this now, but if you refrain from this piercing for at least a few years, you'll be glad you did further down the track.|`|KoAQn69Vaa	I got my eyebrow pierced when I was 14 and my lip when I was 15. I didn't tell my parents though. It will be fine - it shouldn't stretch - I've never experience stretching in any of my piercings (and I've had lots!). I don't think 15 is too young (although the piercer might so don't tell them!)|`|tao83sDxaa	yes, yes , yes.|`|tbwp9Ko8aa	I was 14 when i got double snake bites :)|`|MtoIxY6Qaa	yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee...  its tacky, goth, unattractive, and reeeeeeeeeeeeealy ugly!!!!!|`|BaNrweQ4aa	no of course not :) if you want one; then have one :) a mate of mine has a lip peircing and she has just turned 16. so many people have them these days anyway.|`|pxwqB9Zyaa	Not if you are a member of a traditional African tribe.    Otherwise, Why?|`|TstiC2Ilaa	It's too young to go to a piercer by yourself, because you have to be 18. But I got my lip pierced with my mom when I was 16. And my belly button done when I was 14. So I'm pretty sure it's not to young. And it doesn't stretch. :]|`|c0XomxxEaa	No.. its not too young, as piercings are a modern fashion for teenagers.. It won't stretch unless you stretch it yourself?|`|r4CJ0NbHaa	I don't think 15 is too young to get your lip pierced i got my lip pierced at fifteen haha...If its really something you want then go for it!|`|vL6Lm9Szaa	I don't personally think that 15 is too young, I'm 15 and I want to get snake bites sometime soon, so I guess my opinion is kind of biased lol, but lip piercings are sick!|`|KiaoDGGZaa	nope your totally fine nothing to worry about =]|`|d12161d1226915e575c51c69af7d440eaa	no, i got mine at 13.|`|fyXTjMQdaa	Nahh.

hNShT9yhaa	yeah i totally get what your saying. I wear the ones with the name plastered on it and stuff BUT i only buy stuff from hollister off the clearance racks so the most expensive thing I've ever bought there was a 30 dollar pair of jeans, and if it says hollister across it ( shirts ) i only payed 15 bucks for it not like 30 dollars original price,|`|FvVqFFrNaa	Shouldn't this be in the gay, lesbian bi sexual section?|`|XdBbAHbbaa	UMM...just shutup!!! You have no clue what you're talking about!! People don't just like the cloths because it has a logo on it, they like it because it last longer than  most brands. Just because you can't afford it doesn't mean you half to make it sound bad. Some people don't like Walmart.|`|fMnrAhtiaa	yes, i hate it. wouldn't everyone rather wear more inexpensive prettier clothes than ugly expensive clothes? gosh!|`|yxKb6g9xaa	Umm i wear all those brands but i dont wear them because of the label thats on them.  if i like the way a piece of clothing looks im going to wear it regardless of price, where i got it, or what label it is. i have lots of clothes that have juicy, ed hardy, true religion etc. plastered across the front of them but its not because im trying to shove it down anyones throat that i can afford it or anything.|`|AA10487943	Yes, it is vacuous vanity, causing further degradation to our society, socially irresponsible, and setting an unhealthy financial example to younger generations.  Look at my photo here, I am wearing a cute top that I got from Ross for $6.00.|`|0R9j4VEMaa	yeah i know sounds like my friend s and some of the clothes arent even that great ae or aeropostale but juicy is hot|`|6uZ0VHFTaa	Sounds like you are insecure about yourself. It doesn't bother me at all. What looks good on them would look much better on me. I am proud of my wardrobe. It doesn't matter what the cost. It is the man or woman inside the clothes that matters.|`|JIel7eM5aa	YEP!  Hahahah, reaaally hate it.  And at the local outlets, if I really feel like buying a teeshirt from those places with a logo slapped across it, I can get them on clearance for 6-12 dollars(:|`|lzYRDU1aaa	Yeah, I know what you mean.     At aritzia, I love some of their stuff, but it's all horrible quality. And like you said there's t-shirts for like $60... I think it's pointless, but other people like that kind of stuff :]|`|4Q1asqr5aa	yes thay need to get over it
AA10236815	Artistry has two options that you can try. The Replenishing Eye Cream and the Vitamin C + Wild Yam Treatment. The one you choose would depend on your budget (the replenishing eye cream is a little cheaper) and the results that you're looking for (the Vitamin C + Wild Yam treatment is stronger). Check them both out at the site below!     http://aorihuela.qbeautyzone.com/|`|YwHl37Hgaa	Be gentle with your skin and it will go a long way in keeping it smooth and supple. Gently massage the marks with glycerin-honey mixture. Dip a cotton pad in unbeaten egg white, and smooth it across wrinkles. Leave it on for an hour and remove it with a cotton dipped in ice-cold water.

That thing where they stick a giant needle in your face and inject some wierd liquid into it.|`|ybbte4snaa	Yes, there are a lot of eye creams available in the market.  Top brands are Ponds, Loreal, Olay, Nivea, and a lot more.    There are different creams for different problems such as for eye bags, anti-wrinkle, or whitening.    You may try botox injections too. Do check with a certified dermatologist so she can prescribe the right solution for your case.|`|uiYbzSX8aa	Look for an anti eye wrinkle cream that contains these ingredients:    1. Sunscreen to protect from further sun damage,  2. A topical retinoid (often sold as "retinol", which is a form of vitamin A) to repair and regenerate damaged skin cells,  3. Peptides to stimulate the production of collagen, and  4. Vitamin C, a powerful antioxidant and anti inflammatory agent, to combat free radicals that cause wrinkles and other signs of aging.

I don't know what your hair color is, but the outfit itself is great.. try wearing it with a pair of keds skimmers that are soo in... i would wear it to school cause can button up the outer shirt enough or just like for going to the mall ro anything casual.|`|rFfcD8aaaa	That outfit is totally cute! I would buy it. I wouldn't wear the full outfit to school, but I would wear it shopping, or while I'm hangin' out with friends.

T7r3ocJXaa	Just a coincidence. I happen to weigh 115 pounds and I am 5'4''.  I shop at stores like Old Navy, Aeropostale,  Gap,Hollister Abercrombie and American Eagle.  No offense she does not wear a 0.   She should at least be a size 2.  and as a resource i shop at these stores because if you are the same height as me you will need a LONG. so the stores i listed above give specific sizes such as a 2 long and trust me on this they will be the perfect fit|`|AZT8N5pTaa	seems right, i am the same...but each store has a different "size 0" so make sure to have a gift receipt!!!|`|fRYQfvNaaa	If she dosn't want you knowing her pant size then why in the world would she want you buying her clothes, especially ones that are too big for her stop embarrising your friend.  jealous hoe|`|mx1IZjyKaa	umm, if your gunna buy her something, y wud she lie about her size if shes just gunna hav 2 return them if shes lying??    imm exactly that size and im a size 0|`|sg0m6LBRaa	seems like a size 0...  idk i wear a size 0 and im 99 pounds and 5'4|`|CDBRXtnLaa	cords? i dont know what those are and if she is talking about shoe size maybe i dont know! she is a size 0 in what and what are cords!!!! email me and tell me!!!|`|MdJ2JVoDaa	im 5'4 and i weigh 105 pounds and i wear size 0 too. so u should just believe your friend. ;P|`|u31B8Ycjaa	she might wear a size 0..  if shez yo friend why would she lie to you?|`|Z8d9ipxmaa	It's possible, yeah. Weight and height aren't the only thing to determine clothing size, body composition (fat level, muscle level) count too.   Muscle is compact but it weighs more, whereas fat has a larger volume and is lighter than muscle. A very muscular girl at size 2 can heavier than a size 6 girl who has a higher body fat level.|`|6nqSyISTaa	I'm 5'0 and I weigh around 89...and I can fit into a 00 in Roxy. (well, it has to be hemmed but w/e)    HAHA buy her the cords and if she was lying about her size, she''ll suffer by not being able to wear the awesome and sexy pants you buy her! Her loss, not yours.    Hope this helps!|`|FmjWCMb5aa	a size 3, that is about my size and I wear 3s|`|7f9ZHXUGaa	actuall that seems like a size 0|`|c9Jjk7V4aa	she could wear a size 0 long.  Im 5 foot 4 and 107 lbs.  I wear a 1|`|7Sa4fkUlaa	I would say she is probably in that range. Although if she is exaggerating  then buy her the zero with a gift receipt. That way she does not feel insecure and she can return them for the correct size if they don't fit! Good Luck!|`|jvFhoov7aa	i dont know what cords are but just get the size 0
f3d7e377a29aa0fee9567ce8e141d50aaa	She is young and has good skin  - it does not look like she is wearing much at all.  I would try:     Smashbox bronzing primer    A little translucent powder    A light pink or peach blush    A copper eyeshadow crayon smudged around whole eye with some brown mascara    Clear or peachy gloss    The thing that sticks out to me is that even though she is not always a readhead she has some very warm tones (like a readhead)  I think what appeals to you about her coloring and makeup is that aspect.  I dont think this look could be achieved by someone who has a different skin tone but would be very easy on someone with reddish hair and pale skin.|`|lVkaALbOaa	waw she's pretty i want to know too please send me msg if you know how to make it|`|MHBuk11taa	you need foundation, mascara and eyeliner! =]|`|2JQDpcZ5aa	well she def has a natural look so this is what id do-    1. apply foundation  2. put on a little bit of bronzey eyeshadow but make it smudgy  3. line your eyes with brown eyeliner on top and bottom lids  4. put on some brown mascara  5. maybe a little bit of bronzer but definitely optional  6. put on some lip color the same color as your lips    and there ya go! :)  hope that helpssss!
3XZX5Mj6aa	Pierced ears on babies aren't attractive. Wait until she's older, then she can choose to have her ears pierced or not. Though the other answerers are talking about "get the pain over and done with", to be honest, it's not like the pain is going to get worse as she gets older. And anyway, 6 or 7 years is hardly a long wait for your baby, if you both decide to get it done then.|`|lU8e0VQFaa	This is really your choice, there are always going to be people on both sides, some saying yes and some saying no. In many cultures the babies have their ears pierced before they ever leave the hospital. Personally, I don't have a problem with it, as long as you are ready to take proper care of them since she isn't able too.|`|MGjMjWwaaa	I was wither 2 weeks or 2 months when i got mine done   and i am thanking my mom alot im 15 now and i just went for my second hole last year and i realized how lucky i was not to have to get my first hole when i was 14   so i think peircing babys ears are a good idea because i think all girls at some point want there ears pierced and it just saves the trouble and fears of getting it done if you get it done when your a baby,|`|bAYVSfdJaa	A good age is when she can make her own decision about it.  It's her body & I think it's quite mean of you to put your child through that pain all for the aesthetics of it.|`|MtoIxY6Qaa	as tempting as this sounds: dont do it! this will very likely get your baby's ears infected for her being too young, i would wait till shes over the age of 6. it also may cause people to think: "hats so tacky that a baby would get thier ears pierced."  you want to be a good parent and be smart and resourceable.|`|u31B8Ycjaa	yes!  my parents got mine done when i was a baby.  shes going to cry, but it will be worth it in the end.|`|1yGDFTieaa	No.  Your baby will soon begin fiddling with the earrings, if she does so with dirty hands then an infection is likely.    Also, having worked in Claire's I've seen some pretty bad things happen when a baby gets it's ears pierced. One case was where the baby moved its head just as the piercing gun was 'shot'.  It caused great distress to the baby and it's honestly not worth the risk.    Ask her if she'd like them piercing when she is 9+, she's much more likely to be able to take care of the piercing herself.|`|RJL9I2xpaa	NO!|`|s2F6pK9Xaa	That's a personal decision. If you do, the holes may end up lopsided or crooked in the future, since she is still growing. However, Chances are she would want them pierced when she gets to be about 6 or 7 anyway, and THEN it will hurt a lot more than it will now...I mean, she won't remember having it done at 7 months, but it will be a lot more traumatic at an older age since she will actually know what it is that is being done and will be able to think about it and be scared of it.    The decision is up to you.|`|r1MImdh3aa	No! That's her choice someday.|`|9WMgb4phaa	Yes I would she might cry a bit but she will be ok just clean them like they tell you!! GOOD LUCK!!!!|`|I1NERG30aa	nooooo, please don't. it's best to wait for her to make her own decision of whether or not she wants them. also as she grows, the hole might not be in a perfect spot cause her ear will grow. so wait!!  (i also feel like babies look really weird with their ears pierced).|`|QClFoSNhaa	I had both of my daughters ears pierced at 3 mo they dont remember the trama at this age|`|lkjjxAK4aa	You should try and have her ears pierced as soon as you can - the younger they are the easier it is. My eldest was 6 months old when I had her ears pierced and it went so well I had her ears double pierced a couple of months later. It looks so cute when you see them with studs in their ears that you wont regret it. Also the sooner you get them done the sooner she can wear her diamond studs.   The only problems with the diamonds though is that she might be able to pull them out and they might get lost, or the posts might be a bit long and poke into her head.  Anyway, good luck and I hope you get her ears pierced.|`|11zEFfiuaa	It's not like you're putting a tattoo on her... ear piercings can close and later if she doesn't like them...she can let them close...
HHyny0JSaa	6-8 months at a minimum. You really should wait a couple of months between stretchings. If you stretch too fast you will tear your lobes causing scarring and the possibility that they will never go back to normal should you choose to take the jewelry out somewhere down the road.|`|bAYVSfdJaa	90, at least.  Although, you should probably wait longer than a month before stretching up.|`|WLuEIwp5aa	Probably 4-6 months.  You MUST wait 4-6 weeks between sizes and you CANNOT skip sizes.  If you want nasty blowouts and ugly ears, you can do it in a day if you really felt like screwing yourself up completely, but if you want to do it right, you need to take it slow.    Once you get up to larger gauges, you have to be really careful about not tearing your ears (microtears are invisible, by the way, and they do happen) or you could end up with infected holes in your ears, scar tissue building up and making your ears impossible to stretch farther, blowouts, or any number of other complications.    Please look up some good information, be patient, and do it right.  I won't be as nice when you come back asking us how to fix a blowout.    If you do get to 00g in less than 4 months, you did it completely wrong and probably permanently damaged your ears.
w3Kc0Psaaa	I also have long curly hair.    I have mine cut with side bangs that I straighten and lots of layers.    For an up-do, try putting your hair in a low messy side-bun with a few ringlets left out around your hair line to frame your face. To make the side bun have your hair clean and dried with a diffuser attachment for your blow dryer. Use your finger (not a brush!!!) to pull your hair down to the nape of your neck under your ear. Make sue you can still see your part. After that, twist your hair loosely into a bun. Tuck the end of your hair under the bun and tie a clear hair elastic around the bun. when you've done that, pull a few strands of hair out around the top of your hair line with the end of a rat tailed comb. Viola! beautiful part 'do!        Hope I was helpful to you!|`|nHmlYIWuaa	http://images.askmen.com/galleries/actre...    I really love her hair!|`|7oMOkmO7aa	I had curly hair for the LONGEST time! Don't feel sooo bad I hated my hair and still do today. Anyways I just found a great new hair style. Do you like long hair? Do you like your hair long? If you don't then I recommend that you cut it. My hair looks amazing now that I cut it really short. Do what you want but I think it might look cute on you.

rcEvWB1kaa	i did my own w/ a needle in the thickest part of the cartilage...i'd rate it a 2...until you roll over in bed and lay on it!!! ouch!  anyway...just make sure you clean properly...and NEVER use peroxide...it can cause more infection.  i'd recommend rubbing alcohol.  mine took about a month to heal.  try not to touch it too much and always clean it after doing your hair.  getting hairspray/gel/moose/conditioner whatever in it is one of the biggest causes of infection.  so just keep it clean, and no touching!!!|`|MzIDFWYPaa	i want to get 3 cartilage piercings i heard it hurts pretty bad but if you really want it you can handle it i think they look sexy just go for it C=|`|3JkZPMvYaa	it does't hurt it's just a pinch but dont irrittate it and follow the instuctions to keep clean and sanitary coz a few days after it will hurt|`|uOdXVr0jaa	I got my cartilage done last new years.  No sweat. : )  it hardly hurts, but it does bleed.   getting the piercing is the easy part,   taking care of it, and making sure not to bump it or sleep on it is the hard and painful part.  its totally worth it though.   the only thing i would recommend is that when you change your earring, stay away from barbells, they make the spot sore and are more easily infected.  small earrings are cute and they dont get sore easily.
I6zQeNGzaa	Well the guy in the first picture looks like he has a different hair texture than you do so you're not going to get the same results.|`|gOI2Bgfjaa	you scare meee|`|MGjMjWwaaa	i'd try going to the barbor and showing them the pic   thats probs your best bet|`|D8lmVzyvaa	Hmmmm.....

5ZK9VGPCaa	I have a cute short black tight denim skirt with gold chain zips on the butt pockets and I like wearing it with preppy oxf shirts and cardigans, sweaters, things like that. I wear black or dark maroon or dark purple tights with it. You could also wear skin coloured tights and then put knee or thigh socks over them. This looks good with a short pleated skirt (grey perhaps) with ballerina flats or semi high heels. I have black knee socks with really thin velvet ribbons on the sides from Accessorize, they are adorable and make my calves look really slim.    Even if you dress punky, you can still wear tights in the way I described above. With a black denim skirt for example. Maybe you could wear more brightly coloured tights.. something like mustard yellow, or royal blue. You can also wear coloured over knee socks with a plaid skirt. Just add your own edge to it and accessorise it.|`|fMPyLqW4aa	You can wear it anyway you want. As long as you have a pretty face and nice posture you will look fine. The new "in" thing is kinda like geeky prep and stuff.|`|0X9x5YrOaa	with flats or nice heels. for a more casual look wear it with a nice boot. that's all.|`|EXisORX2aa	It's all about layers.    http://z.hubpages.com/u/410597_f260.jpg  http://girldir.com/files/images/colored-...|`|ro3X9fs3aa	http://girldir.com/files/images/colored-...      :) great looks|`|8e4fc719086a20ed4db62bae7f7a4446aa	wear them however you want, personally I don't wear tights any differently in the winter than I do in any other season. I just wear boots with them more because of the weather. Dress the way you would normally dress and just put tights with it. My style is kind of vintage so in the winter I wear alot of vintage style tops with a nice cardigan and skirt, then tights to match. Or a jumper and cardigan with tights. Just work them into what you would normally wear.
6631c5068e2c4c313b1caa78900e6761aa	use alcohol.....that should be good|`|lU8e0VQFaa	Unless you have an autoclave it will not be sterilized, (in fact burning makes it worse by depositing chemicals on the needle). Plus you need to sterilize the jewelry as well.    If you want to minimize the chance of getting an infection then get it done with a professional.|`|bAYVSfdJaa	You put it in an autoclave - Nothing else will sterilize it.  And why are you calling it a "gauge needle"? It's just a needle, a gauge is a size...|`|uzTFmq4Daa	the professional way- autoclav. wihcih costs lots of money.    cheap do it at home way: basically anyway is just as crappy alcohol, hydrogen peroxide, fire.     your still prone to infection no matter how you sterilize it. its how you take care of it after that, that prevents infection. ask for more tips if you want.|`|Qxk1V55Zaa	umm put it in rubbing alcohol for 5 minutes take it out hold it with tweezers. burn it with a lighter for 1 minute and then put it back into the rubbing alcohol for another 2 minutes

lU8e0VQFaa	They don't die from the piercing they die from the infection they get either by going to a dirty shop, doing it themselves or not following proper aftercare.|`|AKnC6ZRwaa	you can not die from the actual piercing. you have a slight chance of dieing if you get infection. its infected form inproper care which means you are irresponsible. the reasom you could possibly die is from having the infection and still not cleaning it and seeing a doctor.    i do not have the piercing but i hear that is one of the most painful.     hope i help    xoxo  madison    p.s. everyone who reads this please answer my most recent question!|`|IL0NWR4oaa	It doesn't hurt a lot.

XUwtAWzkaa	Well I heard a couple months ago that colored jeans are going to make a comeback this spring, like light green yellow and brown ect... don't know if this is true but I don't usually forget things.|`|KoAQn69Vaa	hi! I think light coloured denim will be in this year - stone or acid washed. Almost white with lots of rips and tears. I wouldn't go for dark blue cause I think it looks boring.|`|fMPyLqW4aa	I think colored jeans are either going to go way out or come way in soon. I would go with a dark wash to be safe.|`|X6I49NUZaa	Dark denim always looks good, on and with anything.

zdMFykrsaa	When did you get it done?    My piercing did the same thing when I changed the ring.  It happened because I changed it to early. However, mine was only red and had the pus come out. It wasn't itchy or swollen. After a few days it went down and it looks normal.     did you do anything to it (like change it)?     Maybe it's irritated by clothing or something?    It also could possibly be an infection. Either clean it with a salt water solution and/or get it checked out by a doctor or at the place you got it done. If you go to the doctor he should give you a prescription that will help it. Keep an eye on it and clean 1-2 times a day. If it continues, defiantly go to a doctor. the sooner you get it checked out, the less chances you have to take it for good.|`|L4gtJfNmaa	Its infected, go to the doctor|`|xuV1xsImaa	It is probably slightly infected, this happened to mine. Don't use Hydrogen Peroxide, that will make it worse (i didnt know that and i kept using it). Use Bactine, you can find it in the band aid isle, it is a white bottle with a green cap. Spray that on their for a week and it should be clear.|`|HwaAAIOEaa	You should be doing sea salt soaks! sounds like the beginning of an infection... Try going back to the place who pierced it and see what they say or go to a doctor                   1/8 teaspoon sea salt (Not table salt)  1 cup warm water    Put it in a shot glass or a small dixie cup an put it over your navel for 5 minutes then rinse it off|`|cvIMUbGuaa	if the puss is yellow, go to a doctor. he'll give you meds so you can fight off the infection and not have to take it out. Its normal to have a clearish white puss tho. it sounds like yours is infected because of the swollen and itchy... definitely go to a doctor. your belly button is a direct passage to your tummy from before you were born and you could end up in the hospital. seriously, my sister almost died from it.  The salt soaks are an option. however, they could dry out the surrounding skin which is exactly what you don't want. I suggest using eye drops. the saline keeps skin moist and clean. keeping skin moist will help if the jewelry gets snagged on something, your skin won't rip so easily.
JIel7eM5aa	ANEW really isn't that good.  Mario Badescu is fabuloussss though.  My mother uses it, and it works so well!

AA10702820	I get the trios. Umm as for colors, figure out what color would bring out your eye color best. Then go on the NYX site and look at the colors.    Right now I only have 2 NYX trios and they are in Cool Blue, Hot Pink and Cherry. And then I have Lime Green, Yellow and Tropical.    I want to get more and one of the ones I'm gonna get next time is called Anti Diva, I think. It has a pretty teal color, tan and white. There's a few others I've been looking at but I forget their names.    Remember to use a base before applying your eyeshadow. Eyeshadow primer like Too-Faced Shadow Insurance or any kind of concealer all over lid to keep the shadow from creasing, fading and to make the shadow stay vibrant all day. :)    All the best!!!|`|KuyTWJPZaa	deep purple, dark brown, and navy are my favs!  they are great shadows btw! good choice!

nlQdROaKaa	It depends. If you have a great body then by all means shave it off and get a tan and show it off. The girls really like it these days and if you find someone that likes hair it can always grow back.     I've shaved my chest many times. It has never itched. I dunno your skin may be different, but outher places that I shave usually itch but my chest never has, what usually happens is it gets very red and irritated on me but goes away that day and when i put on a white tank top it kinda sticks to my chest weirdly but its never really bothers me.     If someone tells you its not manly to shave your chest, who cares what they think the girls like it and times have changed.|`|e7f9613d5b480e9758d037bfe66ac6b9aa	shave|`|ToztjpAsaa	It can get a bit itchy as it grows back, but give it a go.

Waxing lasts a lot longer then shaving, about a good week longer. Plus every time you go and get it waxed, the hair on your back becomes thinner and less noticeable because its been ripped from the "root" so many times. When you continuously rip the hair from the "root", then the cells that make the hair on your back will just stop producing.    Plus, when you get it waxed, it doesn't itch at all.

Toothpaste works well too.|`|da43dabf7871960d74ed399773611dfaaa	Go to a commercial jewellers, they usually sell small kits for about $10 that contain a cleaning cloth, cleaning fluids, etc etc. for jewellery.    Any advice you use on Yahoo! Answers is used at your own risk, but going to the jewellers and getting one of these jewellery cleaning kits gives you a lot more safety and a better guarantee, plus any additional advice can be given to you from the experts themselves.

Tcku8YpGaa	I don't have any body piecings, but I have nine self-pierced ear piercings..    and boy, they get infected all the time.  when they do get infected, I mix a sea-salt and water solution:  Mix a small solution of sea-salt (it can be ordinary table salt if you don't have sea salt) with water: about a spoon of salt in half a cup of water? (When i say cup, i don't mean measurement units, I just mean a normal drinking cup.. that people use.)    and then, microwave it for a couple of seconds, maybe 12?  just so its nice and warm..  but not so warm that it burns your skin. :x    and then..  grab a cotton ball, soak it with the solution, and use it to clean your piercing.  make sure you let the salt water and everything soak into the weird blister you have.  it may burn a little.. but it means germs are being killed!|`|HwaAAIOEaa	Go back to the piercer who did it and ask what to do.

AA11620477	Jaundice is the yellow staining of the skin and the whites of the eyes (so if it's just your skin, more than likely it's not Jaundice, but that's not a definate NOT). Yellowing of only the skin also can be caused by eating too many carrots or drinking too much carrot juice.  If you're concerned about Jaundice, read some more about it at http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/h...  If you're looking for makeup to help hide the pale, yellowish tint try using makeup with more of a pink or rose tint rather than a yellow tint.    As others have said, tanning MAY help, but then you run the risk of exposure to cancer.  A great self tanning product that I use is L'Oreal tanning gel for face, it smells great, leaves skin smooth, and doesn't leave you looking orange after you're done.  For best results, exfoliate before you use it. :)  Hope that helps - good luck|`|0c59319423d8142d5aa9ecbc69b7e569aa	Get a tan, or there is stuff you can spray to make you tanned.

Unfortunately I lost Pablo's cell phone number, so I called Auntie several times. Today I called again and Auntie picked up the phone, but after 5 seconds the line cut. I tried 3 times but there is a problem. Could you please send me Pablo's cell phone number so that I can talk to him? As far as I know, he is very couriers with the turtles. I will give him my word that I will manage it for him before January.  Yesterday I visited Mr. Rango, and his condition is not very good. Please take good care of yourself and check your pressure on a daily basis.    - Just one question... do you mean TAKING CARE OF the turtles, instead of MANAGING the turtles?

i9PfjsoHaa	Los delineadores lquidos quedan muy padres sobre todo para la noche pero requieren un poquitn de prctica y/o buen pulso. Si te animas por uno lquido hay diversos, muy fciles son unos que son casi como plumones, los de aplicadores ms alargados (como pinceles) son un poquito ms difciles. Si ests an por empezar y requieres prctica puedes mejor usar un lpiz o un crayn. Yo prefiero, cuando tengo prisa, el crayn, deja una lna ms gruesita pero es muy rpido y ms fcil. Escogelo en una tienda y tomate tu tiempo para ver los aplicadores y pregunta lo que quieras. Ahora, para la aplicacin, acrcate a un espejo fijo para que tengas tus dos manos libres. Si ests empezando es ms fcil hacerlo sentada y con tus codos apoyados en la mesa y tu cuerpo reclinado hacia adelante. Mirate en el espejo con una mano jala un poco tu prpado (como si te chinita) del mismo lado y con la otra pinta la raya y luego lo mismo con el otro ojo. Es normal que tome un tiempo pero lo dominars sin problemas. Ah! y si de plano no se te d   pues compnsalo con unos labios lindos y una buena mascara como Volume Shocking con las que te quedan unas mega pesta?as y ya casi ni delineador te falta! Como sea, te deseo mucho xito!|`|j3SN3pqkaa	Con un lapiz de ojo ***** (con punta fina)|`|441031125934c9df5715c6bf6dfd0a5eaa	Existe en el mercado delineadores lquidos a prueba de agua, lpices de todos los colores, solamente necesitas un poco de prctica para realizarlo. suerte!!!|`|245c1145d8967c2561bb26e23c3d94b6aa	Es mejor un lpiz, pero ojo, escoge bien el color segn tu tipo de ojo y color de piel,  porque podras verte demasiado cargada de maquillaje,  podras empezar con un lpiz caf, ya que a la mayora nos queda y  se puede disimular errores, el lpiz *****, es mas difcil de corregir y suerte...|`|nIIhEMnXaa	con delineador liquido ***** con punta muy fina , solo sigues la linea de tu ojo y listo|`|MkkfpuQwaa	cn un lapiz|`|UEiSEZPWaa	Bueno yo te recomiendo que te pintes con un lapiz de marca loreal o maybelline, ponte la linea muy firme y que se haga ver y asi tu lindos ojos te resaltaran, hazlo con mucho cuidado por que te puede salir chueca.

Las sombras son buenas, cuando no estas usando sombras o cuando la sombras que usan son bajitas y quieres jugar con los colores, aqui necesitas un pincel delgatido y aplanadito.    El delineador liquido a mi me fascina para la noche, ya que intensifica la mirada, en el dia lo puedes usar cuando quieres asentuar unicamente este rasgo, que solo vean tus ojos, pero no abuses, ya que se ve poco coqueto en el dia, y en el dia preferiblemente si usas este delineador, usa sombras.    La tecnica de aplicarlos es practicamente como Mar te lo indico, solo que un tip, cuando uno esta aprendiendo la mano tiembla mucho, entonces te apoyas sobre el cachetito y realizas varios puntitos peque?os a lo largo del ojo ........... ya que has terminado los jungas ______, como cuando chiquitas uniamos puntos.    El grosor de la rayita tambien varia segun tu necesidad, entre mas delgada mas desapercibida pasa y mas natural se ve el ojo, aunque sea con sombra de color.    Las lineas gruesas las usos con las sombras ya que puedo poner una linea gruesa de un color y una delgada de otro.    El liquido... de preferencia iniciar delgadito y terminar grueso no mucho para formar un ojo tipo venadito.    Ahora, tanto el lapiz como las sombras las puedes difuminar, es decir, despues de aplicarlas, para darles una apariencia todavia mas suave le pasas una brochita por encima recorriendola, eso le da un aspecto ahumadito natural, que no sabes si es pintura o es sombra de las pesta?as o el ojo.    Eso si, despues de poner el delineador no olvides usar el rimel y tus ojos luciran espectaculares.|`|u4Sm2lE7aa	con lapiz|`|RGMqrIUdaa	pues el liner liquido es la mejor opcion para que no se te manche el parpado el lapiz se corre mientras que el liner dura mas|`|LQXH4ISjaa	Pues mira no recomiendan los medicos que te pintes la parte de arriba de hojo con lapiz de hojos porque puedes coger una enfermedad aunque yo lo ago y te recomiendo que lo agas con un lapiz que es lo mejor vale venga adios|`|XetKXukoaa	con eye liner, queda mas bonita que con lapiz y no se difumina, practica porque al principio nos ponemos perdidas|`|fox8NvMjaa	Hola, para m es mejor pasarla kon el eyeliner, pero es ms difcil, con el lpiz de ojos te apa?as mejor xo se va ms rpido k kon el eye liner, yo lo k hago para guiarme es dijarmela primero con lpiz de ojos y luego la repaso kon el eye liner y me gusta alargarme un poko el rabiyo, espero haberte servido de algo, besitoss|`|HohsvBkeaa	puedes delinearte los ojos con diferentes cosas hay delineadores como el lpiz hay lquidos y hay esponjas brochas delgadas para que delinees tus ojos con sombres.  puedes intentarlo con varias formas, primero estira bien tu prpado hacia el lado contrario del lagrimal y despus pinta toda la orilla intentalo varias veces y con diferentes, tcnicas, lpiz, liquido, etc.  el liquido es fcil utilizarlo cuando la brocha es delgada y peque?a porque no se mueve tanto.  el lapiza es mancha por asi decirlo y si tus ojos son grandes resaltaran mas,  y las brochas son faciles de usar pero tienes que usar la mas delgada y sombras oscuras para que se vea mejor.   saludos|`|CMSmGBUxaa	si,con el mismo lapiz o delineador  nose como le digas tu  cuando te ballas a delinear en vez de jalarte el ojo hacia abajo, cierra el parpado ten mucho cuidado hasi te pintaras arriba y abajo.(no te ballas a picar un ojo).|`|GnppCWc4aa	Lo mejor es el eyeliner; hay distintos tipos de pincel i de potes.

1c6ed761e93747859f1af8462bbb5996aa	Hola: a mi criterio creo que ninguna ya que una gordita se siente feliz y libre de comer lo que quiera pero a la hora de comprarse ropa y no conseguir, o incluso ropa de ella misma le deja de quedar o no le queda tan bien como antes, es obvio que se va a sentir mal, y eso es lo de menos porque el mayor problema es la salud de ella misma, y el hecho de que a pesar que muchos lo desmientan vivimos en una sociedad que discrima a las personas gorditas (entre otras cosas), por otro lado est la flaquita frustrada que se priva de comer lo que le gusta, que no puede salir tranquila con una amiga o amigo a tomar un helado porque ?Cuantas calorias puede llegar a tener! quizas se vea divina con su ropa, pero ?como se siente por dentro?, y como ya sabemos el hecho de que puede tener muchisimos problemas de salud por falta de vitaminas, proteinas y minerales esenciales para el funcionamiento de nuestro organismo.  Para todo debe haber un equilibrio no se debe comer de ms ni de menos y asegurarse de que los alimentos que consuman sean saludables, hacer un poco de ejercicio, aunque sea una caminata por da, y sobre todo aceptarse como es y quererse, porque si uno no se siente bien con uno mismo nunca se va a poder sentir bien con otras personas. No se elviden que todos son lindas y lindos si estan saludables.  Besitos!|`|845cf5bb429bb898a8ecff3aa5ea60cfaa	mmm ..  nada sabe tan rico como poder ponerte la ropa que te gusta y verte super bien con ella|`|H6BECFtdaa	Ni unas, ni otras. las personas felices son las ke estan consientes de su salud y se cuidan!!!

En cambio las chicas flakas ke viven su vida cuidandose, igual son infelices porke viven precionadas y mas si tiene un problema de bulimia o anorexia: estas chicas nunca podran ser felices porke igual atentan con su salud y nunca estaran agusto con su aparencia!!! lo mejor es mantenerte en tu peso normal, ke aquivale a lo ke mides: ejem: si mides 1.60, mantente en 60 kilos. Ahora ke si kieres seguirle el juego a la sociedad, pues puedes mantenerte en 55 kilos y asi te ves bien, porke es lo sano!!! hay ke saber ser mujer!!! pero en verdad mujer: ke si es hora de ponernos a dieta, fajarnos las faldas y restringirnos y si es hora de disfrutar de un rico helado, saberlo disfrutar y no dejar ke este tipo de preocupaciones desvien nuestra atencion de cosas verdaderamente importantes!!!|`|a7932e70b043d323ad641a9b7466cf3faa	NINGUNA DE LAS DOS PUES A LA LARGA SI COMES DEMASIADO TENDRS PROBLEMAS DE SALUD Y SI NO   COMES NADA IGUAL  PERO SI ES POR ELEGIR A UNA DIGO QUE LAS GORDITAS ESO DE ESTAR OBSESIONADA CON QUE COMER QUE NO ME QUE DA LA ROPA ES PARA ANOREXICAS.

Tal como aconsejan los filsofos (an Digenes, austero extremo) la limpieza es la mejor elegancia, o sea que el jabn y el peine son los artculos que debe tener cualquier bolsillo pobre (el de atrs del pantaln), los zapatos lustrados y la camisa son cuello inmaculado.

Solo necesitas lo ms basico para que luscar espectacular.  1) necesitas un pantaln formal, no es dificil consegirlo compra una tela negra, caf o del colr que gustes y con cualquier sastre que sea un amigo, vecino, conocido, familiar o que te alln recomendado que te cobre a un buen precio.  2) necesitas una camisa formal puede ser lisa, rayada o cuadriculada no es dificil saber que tipo de camisa es segn tus gustos, aunque recuerda no es tambien necesario que tengas que usar una camisa formal ya que puedes usar cualquier tipo de camiseta con un saco aunque le saco si va a salir un poco caro ya que la tela es un poco costosa, pero puedes buscar algo que te salga comodo nada es imposible en este mundo.  3) si utilizas una camisa formal es necesario que utilises una corbata ya que te puede hacer ver mas formal y atractivo de lo que pareces y con mucha elegancia. Igual si no utilizas siempre con tu saco y camisa te podras ver elegante.  4) tu zapatos no es necesario que sean los mejores del mundo solo que sea zapatos formales negros segun el color de tu ropa. Los zapatos casi siempre no tiene que ser muy importantes la mayoria de las personas no se fijan en ellos a menos de que sean color blancos o tenis (jajaja).  5) tu cabello debe estar bien arregla, debes lavarlo, peinarlo y que se mantenga bien fijo para que se vea genial y elegante. Si usas gelatina para tu cabello te recomiendo que te apliques poco ya que si es demanciada puede que pierda el atractivo tu cabello, solo utiliza lo necesario para que se mantenga fijo y genial y recurda arreglarlo no es dificil no caro es de la cosas ms baratas y sencillas.  6) y de ultimo recuerda rasurarte y asi te puedas ver atractivo.

V8fLpQpQaa	I read in Cosmo that having your eye open to the extreme women do when applying mascara causes them to open their mouth because the eye muscle is somehow connected to the lip muscles. They can close their mouth to do it, but they would have to try and consciouslyy be aware of it. |`|GqvAXWNcaa	Its natural. Because we concentrate on it alot. :]|`|8PRR3soraa	Seperates the eye lashes..|`|VYMOwgc3aa	It just comes naturally.    I don't know why exactly, but I read that it helps to keep you from blinking.    |`|IRL73jJRaa	me personally...i can't close my mouth while putting on mascara   i guess it's just a habit woman have |`|fwzh1uWTaa	It stretches out the face so that the area has left... well... fat so that you dont smudge the mascara on that area.|`|2yejIsljaa	As a women myself I can't close my month while putting on mascara. I laugh cuz its a subject that I have often thought about. Like "why does my mouth have to be open?" Well to be perfectly honest I don't know why. And I had to open it.. LOL. I could not do it closed. Well maybe I could but it wasn't normal.   So in light of that I think it still is a mystery.|`|PaoNj61Kaa	Most girls do but I don't lol...weird! |`|10fqpOP9aa	i'm not sure either.  i have to put my mascara on with my mouth closed and my eyes squinted, because if i don't, the tips of my eyelashes touch my eyelids and leave black dots dots on my face.  lol interesting, though.|`|KKFg7pH1aa	I dont =] i learnt not to because i looked stupid|`|Jjgvjc4Daa	It makes you blink less, if not stopping you from blinking altogether therefore making the mascara easier to apply|`|ffU1Ye8Maa	This is a funny question-I've noticed this when I do it too. Very funny when I try and stop myself.  I also raise my eyebrows along with the open mouth.  I figure its natural-plus I don't want to ruin my mascara so its like my mouth is saying 'ohhhhhhh (watch out)' and raising my eyebrows is perhaps due to my eyelashes telling them to get out of the way!    :D hehe|`|FxAWhiTWaa	opening our mouths gives us the perfect angle. The same way that people grimace when they take a crap.|`|AA10335926	some kind of natural reflex on the face. It's like saying 'why are men's eyes half opened when they are about to have an orgasm?' lol..i mean, it's possible for men to  close their eyes if they wanted to right?
Ox5AnRZOaa	get a concave bob.  thats shorter at the back and longer at the fronts..|`|XcxdoqxYaa	this is IMPORTANT!!? quite the opposite...|`|6FL7e4jzaa	My friend has hair like your and just got a face frame and small layers and it looks SO good!!! Maybe do something like that.|`|DWtWLlqkaa	Shave it all off. Not cute, but definitely funky.|`|J5SQ3Dhjaa	By no means is that important, and I do not care about your hair.  In fact you should just freaking chop it all off!|`|L3z7IIISaa	First start using volumized hair products, they will make your hair a little fuller.  Get layers, streaks(not extreme), and bangs (if your head is round side bangs, but not if your head is oval).  Maybe add a little funky colour, like vampire red, neon blue, forest green, purple, at the bottom of your hair. Or go with a deep colour like all black or a light colour like blonde.  Try some boy hair styles, like the more emo boy styles but with a girly twist and bead headish works nice too!|`|5SV6sybJaa	go for the deep side bangs, with a lot of layers in the back...but keep the front (around your face) real straight.  Mold it with wax and wear it kind of messy!!!|`|n00lyo1paa	Get a boy cut that gives you lots of bangs.  You can spike it up later with gel.  It gives you the look of a mysterious detective, a secret agent, or just a rock star.|`|GbmNh7L2aa	get a mohawk everyone woll notice you and will think your awsome|`|AA10234272	go witha a blonde haie syatle and it would make you look cute i think you would look good as ablonde|`|4jSlGLInaa	how about cutting the back tapered to the neck and get some bangs to get some height on top & then hi-lite it.    a girl in my office just did this a it looks very sharp.|`|bb2e5aa1dcddab1df4dda4fe8ac3899baa	There are so many hair style websites out there that will help you acheive what you want to know.  One off the top of my head is Thehairstyler.com.  You can choose models and mold them to have the same features as you then try on different kinds of hairstyles and they will also tell you HOW to style the hair/cut it which is good to know when you get a new hair style.  If you need more just go to a search engine and type in hairsyles and plenty of good websites should pop up.|`|ADb8yLhcaa	I say the concave bob also, If you want it shorter later you always can. But if you have a petite frame, go for the boy/fairy cut, I used to have my hair like that and I loved it, but my hubby  hated it!!!   Anyway, especially for thin hair either style will give you the appearance of more thicker fuller hair!!  Then I would go for a pretty blond, with a few low lights and highlights. You will love it, Promise!!

8u1sQuWWaa	Well, I would fit into the descriptions of "ret.ppl" and "gay fags" because I personally don't like the preppy look or any of those stores, but here's my advice: Whose money is being spent on these clothes?  If it's your mom's, then make a deal that you'll pay for a part of whatever is bought, or set a certain limit (e.g. Your mom will buy up to $50 of the clothes, and you buy anything more than that).  If it's yours, then try to convince your mom that it's your money and you have the right to spend it as you choose, or say that you'll set aside, say 10% of the money towards your college education, a church effort, whatever.  Try to explain to her how well those jeans fit you, or say that she can buy you a pair of jeans from wherever she thinks you should buy them from, if you can be allowed to buy a pair of jeans there.  Write out a list of all the reasons why you should be able to shopt there, and explain them logically to your mom.  And, of course, remember to be polite, or your mom will be much less inclined to agree with you.|`|KCJOHDI1aa	Actually. Gay people like abercrombie and Fitch.    Tell her its the only store that fits you well.  Tell her it has good quality clothes, and show her hot topic and ask her if she would rather have you shopping in there =)|`|0rtloykBaa	just tell your mom youll do whatever you want and A&f is what you want to wear i used to dress in a hip hop fashion and when i moved and switched to all abercrombie and fitch my life has become 500% (maybe more) as fulfilling, next year i am wearing only J Crew which is even more fashionable, just tell her u think the clothes are cute just dont go near the humorous ts guys section she wont like those lol, like "broad minded 36-24-34" i have that one lol|`|L0ibPMhoaa	To tell you the truth this store is way overrated how bout not being like everyone else for a change don't be scared to be different, muster up some confidence and don't just wear those clothes just to be like omg ever so preppy, go around to different stores and be an individual person dress different have some personality of your own! and another thing don't make fun of gay pople your a little 12 year old you know nothing about at least there diffrent and don't try that hard to fit in!
M5PAj5Wzaa	Creo que para esta temporada (verano) no se usan mucho las botas con jean. Te las recomiendo con minis y par qe disimule tu "anchura" puedes resaltar la mejor parte de tu cuerpo.

Sencillez en cuanto a que las prendas clasicas nunca pasan de moda y siempre dan un toque de distincion a quien las porta, en contraposicion con las prendas "de moda" que pueden rayar en lo chabacano y escandaloso. La calidad de la prenda, es decir, el tipo de tela (las fibras naturales son mejores, mil veces, que el poliester) el corte y la elaboracion. Aclaro que calidad no es sinonimo de precio ni de marca, aunque lamentablemente, las prendas de calidad casi siempre cuestan mas... pero vale la pena.

Los elegantes de hoy no usan lo mismo que los elegantes de hace siglos, por ejemplo.       Agrego otras dos, opcin:    D) Vestir de a cuerdo a la ocasin.  Tambin la manera de peinar el cabello cuenta mucho, si eres mujer, tu maquillaje que puede arruinarlo todo y sobrecargarte de accesorios igual. y la opcin:     E) Limpia y planchada, en buenas condiciones, que no est rota, parchada o con seguritos, llena de bolitas (o lanitas), que no te apriete o te quede grande o chica, zapatos boleaditos, en fin, todos los detallitos.    No s, en mi rancho le llaman ropa fina o de vestir, jajajajaja.  Ni modo que de comer, pero as es.      Mi conclusin son las cinco opciones juntas:    Ropa FINA,  bien combinadita (incluye peinado, accesorios y maquillaje adecuados), limpia y planchadita, adecuada para tu figura, la ocasin y la poca, si agregamos un fino perfume, sutil, leve...  ah!

AA11945962	keep it well condition.  healthy and well condition hair will grow faster.|`|LsAjSUv8aa	U should grease your hair with Magic grow African Grease with the little herbs in it to make your hair grow. Trust me it works|`|xvYR5prNaa	patience :P|`|ut85DJ5Xaa	The answer most often given to this question is braids or weaves.  However I believe that they can often do much damage to your hair.  Even if they don't the stress that braiding does can be very hard on your hair.  The best answer I can give you is to just let it happen.  Once your 'new growth' comes in you can start twisting your hair to your scalp (like braiding but not as hard on the hair) at night undo it the next day and  you have a really cute natural looking hairstyle that will last a week.    Also try Pantene's Relaxed and Natural line and use a LOT of conditioner.  When you begin to grow your hair out the point where  your new growth ends and your permed hair begins is very weak and can break off easily if not conditioned regularly and carefully.  Wash your hair once a week and when your new growth is significant use deep conditioner by Pantene Relaxed and Natural every time you wash your hair.  Before then use their regular shampoo and conditioner every week and every other week use the deep conditioner. This product really protects the hair from damge and breakage and produces very soft strong healthy hair.    In either case leave your conditioner on for at least five minutes because your hair is very prone to breakage when you are growing it out.    You may want to press your hair once the new growth portion is long enough.  This will add strength and keep your hair healthy and consistent.

2bPxTJbxaa	Ok, well , do not say "u are just jealous of all the stuff i have", like the person above advises. This will not help u at all. Infact, they would have a right to call u a snob. Instead be ur self, smile, and show them u have a great personality. There is nothing wrong with wearing logos as long s u dont act like u are better than everyone else. Kill em with kindness, compliment them on thier outfits too.|`|ad7821d8149feaa2aa6eb312158ce591aa	its not gonna stop if you dont stop wearing logos|`|OPB8mkm8aa	like gitrl dont stop espressing urself, they just jealus bcuz they dont have dat stuff|`|7joYILriaa	there prob. just jealous, but cmon, with clothes like that, who wouldnt be?? maybe try mixing things up. keep your old clothes, but mix them with like, wet seal or even target. mix ur pearls and diamonds with chunky costume jewlery, things that are enexpensive. if u really care about what people think, why cant you just stop wearing name brands?? or buy from those stores, just buy shirts and stuff that dont have the logo in clear vision. hope this helps, and if any of ur diamonds get boring, u can give them to me :p haha :)|`|A2xNZqMQaa	they are just jellouse of you and wish they had what you did. If u like that stuff and can afford go ahead and buy and wear it all you want. If they just roll there eyes and make comments ignore them or just tell them straight up that they are jelouse of what you have, and that your not trying to flaunt that you wear all those nice clothes but u just wear them becuase you like them. If they keep it up ignore them cuz they are not worth the time of getting annoyed by it. Your better than there little bratty attitudes.|`|2122677c7f148d7a3e477287afae0381aa	ARE you rich? Don't pay any attention to those people, they're not worth worrying over. Either they're jealous, stupid, or don't know you very well. Wear what you would like to wear, but don't show off.

e952acae4053bbcf67e9da40e476f95faa	I dunno about the emo look..but i can tell you how to make your hair grow.    1. Get a trim.. remove all the frilled dead ends.. because they arent growing and will not.  2.Take vitamin E supplements.It will help your hair grow!!  3.Stop dying your hair for a while .|`|pRC5aCQ5aa	if you wanna spike it in the back use got2be hair glue. its really good for that.|`|xvYR5prNaa	u can use hairspray/gel/wax to spike it.  but it has to be quite short in the back to   actually work...  and if ur not compltetely sure that u can   cut it properly urself , u shouldnt do it,   cause the emo style is hard to do. go to  a salon|`|GyfKBiMJaa	use gel and moose sticky things to spike try coloring it not permanet at first try different ones every time|`|bhynIYK4aa	Best way to get long hair fast is extensions, Like my emo hair :]    Well if you go to your hairdressers, ask them to cut you short layers at the top of your head and leave the bottom long, show them a picture or whatever if they dont understand.    And to spike it up you use straighteners first to spike it out then turn your head upside down and spray it with hairspray :]|`|AA11605826	if you want to spike the back its cut at an angle into it to make it easier. Strangely its harder to spike the back than the top. tho I dont have emo hair but it is spikes at the back so i know. your best bet is to go to a hairdresser tho.|`|eRIeDloYaa	i would go get my hair done and if u don't want to put some gel on and it spikes it in back. my brother wanted the same and he has the emo hair and he likes it.|`|3Vw1HxB6aa	emo hair= dont wash your hair for a week, dont brush it for a week, and jam tons of gel on it =] or get a haircut|`|23f4ab0a59e5f6d7c6aa03942026cdb2aa	it would be really great to know if u were a guy or gurl...|`|AA11436889	I don't think it can be considered emo if it was not done out of quiet frustration.

fc4ed1b930b736a8ce9c8a56a8a25960aa	Well.,, This depends on you... If you are skinny enough to fit in the abercrombie, Hollister and Aeropostale,then buy those.

I myself shop at all those shops but mostly Gap and Old Navy.  :D|`|33c907ba0d8e23b30e3edb60a9bd5832aa	what's ur question???  if you are asking which  one i like better....  it would be aero, ae, F21,  and oldnavy.  hollister and abercrombie  are not even original.  everyone and their sister shops there.  try something different,  like Pac-Sun, or Delias.|`|ad7821d8149feaa2aa6eb312158ce591aa	what about them? i like VS the best.|`|4f8dbbfb64ceb84ed6b301fd2ce9a489aa	what is the question?

But, I don't know Hollister, VS, or Abercrombie ( |`|LTWm3QcEaa	What exactly is your question...well anyways...Forever 21 is good because its not too expensive and uh american eagle has some cute trendy things if you can find a sale.

Sorry maybe you could post a pic|`|H0yNSdeTaa	I've known a lot of women who've dyed their hair.  It always looks better naturally.

Not to mention, over time it can be damaging to curl or straighten your hair everyday. Get a haircut that will bring out your texture, like long layers for wavy hair, etc..
Aml2pDc6aa	A red tie would look awesome.  Make sure whatever tie you choose does not have any pattern - since your shirt is striped it would clash if your tie had something on it.  Definitely a red silk tie...|`|AA12223259	black|`|c05702374b5bc85f3a1502d55060a46eaa	I often wear wine ties with dark suits or pants. Some blue ones are OK too. Bright red is liked by many girls but less by men. Black ties are for funerals. For graduation, the tie should not be too casual. Repp stripes are an American businessman's standby. If you wear striped tie with striped shirt, contrast them. A solid color is nice but some find it dull. Pindots are elegant. I have maroon ties with white pindots and blue ones with white or yellow dots. A foulard is formal and elitist to some. It may be in brighter colors than other patterns. I have them in yellow, blue, wine and orange. Much depends upon your coloring. I am ruddy in skin and hair, so green is frightful on me, but it looks fine on my brother who has olive skin and brown hair. You can try it. Black and white are neutrals and go with most colors.|`|4QwKvQWtaa	Red tie if you want something bold.    More conservative, go with a black tie with white, silver or gray shot through it.    For fun, choose a character tie.    With all that black, your options are pretty limitless. Have fun with it and enjoy your ceremony!|`|e9be038ee1aa464073677c3e4d10060faa	red|`|BPwvAATeaa	A white silk tie would do or a shiny red tie would also match well.|`|bgaTyv8Taa	red!! have a good time!!|`|s86wEmLUaa	Anything bright.

Listen to me, I have much experience in the art of dressing men formally... Ifyou MUST wear the striped black shirt, then you want to wear a simple white tie to correspond with the stripes in the shirt. Trust me, you'll look great.

Also, take a look at your eyebrow shape side by side.  You'll see that hers are thicker, more pencilled in.  You don't *have* to arch them into non-existence to look good.

Your legs may turn red and a little bumpy at first if you haven't waxed them before.|`|e7f9613d5b480e9758d037bfe66ac6b9aa	waxing is better|`|Q59mF95vaa	Waxing yanks the hair out at the root, so it will take longer to grow. For a while, it might seem that it grows just as fast as shaving, but after you'll definitely notice that you won't have to do it as often. Getting it professionally done usually gets better results. <br>  <br>  Waxing is messier, more painful and more time consuming than shaving, but it will be better in the long run. You won't have to do it every other day, so I guess it's like you'll be saving time. You'll just have to devote more time when you actually do wax. <br>  <br>  Have you thought about doing something else, like laser hair hair removal? It's more expensive, but it's definitely better to get rid of hair.|`|IPxz1LlCaa	waxing is the best idea.if u wax it the hair will come out after 1 week or after more than 1 week.so after1 week u can wax it.ok.hope i helped.so no need to wax it every day wax it every after 1 week|`|8iR6XOD7aa	you have to wait a amount of time so the hair can grow back, before you get a wax again.|`|MSM66SEnaa	I shave mine every other day too..|`|nwjiJbs2aa	Try out TRIA Laser Hair Removal.

sg27Otkyaa	some funky wellies|`|R75tldc8aa	Definitely wellies or any other kind of water proof boots for weekend festivals. Outdoor music festivals can be veeery muddy, and you wouldnt want to have to walk around in muddy jeans and wet socks. <br>  <br>  However, if the festival is only a day one then check the weather. If it's going to be dry and sunny then you may be able to wear comfortable walking shoes. But I'd say wear wellies anyway just to be on the safe side.|`|EnRjLaKsaa	I usualy wear my walking shoes.  That way I can be comfortable and participate and even dance at music festivals in my town!  Easy Spirit and Naturalizer both make nice looking walking shoes that come in solid tans and blacks.  I like them becuse they look more like work shoes.  Enjoy your musical fetivals.

B6cOlFU9aa	I have gotten lots of prescription products from the dermatologist, and I never liked them because they made my skin very dry and brought out all of my acne. I wish I had stuck with them, because I was so close to clear beautiful skin every time. These products work by bringing the acne that is already under your skin out, instead of just clearing the acne that has already surfaced. For two weeks to a month after you start using them, your acne will get worse, but after that goes away, you will have clear skin.|`|lU8e0VQFaa	It's pretty normal for your skin to get worse before it gets better. I wouldn't worry about it too much. Give it a couple of months, maybe 3 and if you don't see any improvement go back to your Dr and try something else.|`|R75tldc8aa	Keep using it for atleast 1 week and see if there are any changes. Different acne medication has different effects on different people's skin, depending on their skin type and what kind of acne they get. <br>  <br>  If there's no improvement, then book another appointment with your dermatologist. I'm sure there is other prescription acne medication he can give you. There are also pills available.|`|PYIA2FCFaa	always expect your face to look worse while using any dermatologist topical cream. its killing off that layer of skin to reveal new fresh skin.<br>  <br>  i was using Tetratonian spelling?) and it made my face extremely dry and flaky or I would look like i has some type of rash..or more red where the acne was...looks horrible but it works.

cJcwHBglaa	You what?|`|T8ksKCWCaa	In the west, men do not remove their leg hair, unless it is for some good reason, like sports.<br>  But if you remove it because you like it that way, who cares what women think?<br>  I, personally, like hairy men.|`|xbluKawHaa	Normally, at least in the United States culture, only women shave their armpits, the legs, and sometimes their arms.  Now to us, it's not exactly weird, but it's odd to see a man with no arm, armpit, or leg hair.  They're people who do this though, such as swimmers, especially if they have thick long hair on their arms and legs.  Now, some girls may find it different to see a guy who has darkish hair have no body hair, since it's evident that he would have some.  Lighter haired guys, such as blonds, can get away with it more easily, since it's so light it's hard to see the hair anyway.  Now, when the hair grows back it can be really coarse, and that could the problem girls having with you shaving your leg hair.  Yet, I don't know if that's the problem.  Hope I helped.|`|NPhepcBkaa	I think I get what you're saying..<br>  Girls dont like men without leg hair because thats an important part of what makes us different...<br>  And its not very masculine and girls are primarily attracted to people who are very opposite sex-y, lol..|`|K7vCWru6aa	....Seriosuly? this question makes NO sense...|`|hJsFxK8Gaa	the question..didnot get it!|`|VrFa37q3aa	To me it seems odd for a guy not to have leg hair. In my opinion guys should have leg hair, I guess its probably the way we're raised these days that makes us think that guys shouldn't be removing their leg hair. I guess it depends on how much leg hair you have, like if you have alot and its really dark then i would remove it too. If ur going to remove your leg hair then make sure ur legs aren't smooth like a girls, cuz that would be weird. but either way, its ur choice, i personally think guys should have leg hair! <br>  <br>  sorry i couldn't be or more help, good luck =]|`|7UhCC90paa	I'm not going to fill in the blanks of what I "think" you're asking.

AA11101361	For your skin, nothing really.  Supposedly it will make your hair shinier.  As far as skin goes, you should wash with lukewarm water on your face.  Hot water can damage your skin.  As far as pores opening and closing, all you can do is temporarily enlarge or reduce their appearance through heat and cold.  Pores don't open and close and you can't do anything about their size.  Like hair and eye color they are permanent and inherited from your parents.<br>  You might be able to get a closer shave as you skin will have constricted.|`|AA11036219	It is supposed to improve your over all circulation, which is good for everything.|`|RnopSbHqaa	well for the body you just get really cold foro your hair i havev heard that you should wash with warm then cold yeah thats about it|`|bacf6df503bae1003891ca7a81e36298aa	I don't know, but it sure leaves you feeling tingly all over and lessens your ardour!|`|H93JbQS0aa	acts as a toner! closes the pose of skin, and hair is shiny, lol|`|imofYcOHaa	it can make you feel Happier if your upset and refreshed|`|6M1wjdQsaa	It opens up your pores for your face and your hair. Then do cold water to close the pores. Once heard it from a hair stylist. Also you will notice that your hair is a lot softer. Hope this answers your question!<br>  Hiya27|`|rAK9WRi9aa	When you wash your hair with warm water it opens up the strands, after you condition you should wash with cold water to close the strands and keep your hair moisturized and soft and shiny

xkWLcv62aa	My balls are in my bag|`|Gew6pZhbaa	I had a problem like that with my belly button piercing. It never came out, but I noticed the ball would unscrew a lot. All you can do is keep an eye on them. Check through out the day to make sure they're all on tight. That's what I had to do with mine. It sucks, but if it'll keep them in, it's worth it.|`|zlXofrG4aa	Don't touch it/mess with it.  When you mess with it too much you loosen the balls.

hhWDHmfyaa	What foods do you like?  When are you most hungry?  Can you make sure you chew your food 24 times and put down your fork between meals?  Do you have any hidden food allergies or blood sugar issues?  Can you walk two to five miles a day?<br>  <br>  Answer these questions, sincerely, and you can design a diet of foods you like, that will keep you burning calories and loosing weight rapidly and forever and on a diet that's a no brainer.<br>  <br>  Why?<br>  Five miles of walking four times a week will get you to and keep you at your optimal weight.<br>  Chewing your food slowly, and putting down your fork while you chew gives your food more time to digest, and your brain more time to feel satiated, or full.<br>  Looking at the foods you like will tell you what your brain needs to be included in any diet that can be a success.<br>  If you are a pasta fan, an Atkins diet will surely fail.<br>  If you love salads, you will thrive on a high veggie/fruit/meat diet or a high veggie/pasta diet.<br>  <br>  The more stable your sugar and hydration levels during the day will be the optimal condition for you to burn the most calories.  Too much or too little food/sugar/the wrong kinds or too much/too little hydration or the wrong kinds can ensure you gain weight even on a starvation diet.<br>  <br>  Routine, small meals of foods you like, chewed slowly, with 10-25 grams of fiber daily, with water before you eat, not during or after and routine exercise is the most positive weight loss, most rapid and most healthy you could design for yourself.|`|gROdxDhRaa	what|`|EZHZW7QFaa	Losing weight "really fast" is unhealthy and the worst way to go. My b/f is a personal trainer and he always says that you MUST balance diet & exercise. The best thing to do is eat small meals throughout the day. Eat chicken because it has protein, salads, fruits, minimize dressings, salt and pepper - everything in moderation...I have had a lot of friends that try and lose weight fast and they wind up starving themselves and looking sickly and frankly like they have a 12 year old boy's body... Just take the time and dedication to make yourself look good and really commit!|`|rAK9WRi9aa	It's more important to be healthy than to be skinny.  You won't be healthy if you try a quick fix- and you definitely shouldn't skip out on meals!  Eat healthier, eat smaller portions, eat slow, stop eating when you're full.  and EXERCISE!!!  it's near impossible to lose weight if you do not exercise!!|`|9HpE75Vwaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  Have a look at this natural Detox - Weight Loss - Health program.  This product is a natural powerhouse of goodness. And it’s not only said to help you lose weight, but to stay healthier and enjoy more energy too. <br>  <br>  Great Free trial offer for a natural solution !.<br>  <br>  Go to this site  > www.virginiahealthreview.com<br>  <br>  Also  Free sign up for Fitness Magazine.<br>  <br>  www.virginiahealthreview.com|`|6c0624b9f9ca68818c8a837831ae4cfcaa	size 8 isn't at all that bad but if you really want to lose weight fast I would suggest changing your daily diet which I find unhealthy<br>  <br>  first, the reason you tend to eat a lot by the end of the day is because your body craves calories and nutrients. They crave that much because you skip your Breakfast and Lunch which means you're not tending to your body's nutritional needs during the time of the day when you really need them, so by the end of the day when they had fed on your stored energy to allow you to do your daily routine, they crave for energy replacements so whether you like it or not, you end up eating more than you should.<br>  <br>  I would suggest having a lite breakfast, like fresh fruits and non-fat milk then for lunch have some really lite and plain bread with some fresh green salad and by dinner time you can have non-fat milk and some low-cal oatmeal cookies or you can even skip dinner if you think you're still full from the food you've taken earlier during the day.<br>  <br>  If you feel hungry adapting to the new diet, have fresh fruits instead of junk food for your snack<br>  <br>  Avoid sodas and artificially flavored drinks too, remember, water is the healthiest drink of all :)<br>  <br>  good luck
vYeTegZNaa	I no her hair rocks.. and get a small  barreled curling iron and roll it round the iron and then clamp it ... don clamp then curl. You also have to do it layers you have to do it really small pieces at a time.. good luck :)|`|xl5uQj3daa	she uses grease from cars tires she slashes then curls in between picture burnings|`|R75tldc8aa	Try doing rag curls. I'm sure your mum will know how to do them. If not you can find tutorials on the internet. Those make your hair veeery curly when done tight, right up to the scalp like Taylor Swift does. However it can be very time consuming!<br>  <br>  You could also try using a curl enhancing mousse and using small velcro curlers in your hair and leave them to dry (this may take hours). <br>  <br>  Alternatively, you can do as a above only use a small barreled curling iron instead.<br>  <br>  Always remember to spray with hairspray to hold the curls, and don't touch your hair or run your fingers through it once you've done them.<br>  <br>  If her curls aren't natural then she definitely uses one of the above methods. It may take you a lot of trial and error to achieve though seeing as unfortunately most of us don't have professional hair stylists! :(|`|xbluKawHaa	Her curls are natural, one time she stated she would never straighten her hair for a boy again.  Now, you can tell when it's humid outside, because sometimes her curls get poofy, but I'm sure when she has a big show, she'll probably get them tightened or to hang down better.  But you can use a curling iron, I'd say a 1/2 inch or a 1 inch to get curls like that would be best.  Or you could go to a salon, and take a picture of Taylor Swift and ask them how to make the curls and what's the easiest way of repeating it.|`|K7vCWru6aa	Actually much of her hair is natural! She has a professional work on it though, i would suggest going to a pro. No one can do it at home especially when you don't do hair.|`|7hZdI5sJaa	they actually are natural, but if you want to try, use a 1 or 2 inch curling iron and just curl your hair. then spray it with set me up spray by herbal essences. :)|`|fqgbAVi9aa	it actually is natural.<br>  <br>  she just really keeps her hair professionally well conditioned.|`|qNIHAYfJaa	you can most likely get those types of curls with a roller set or a small barrel curing iron...she may have a "curly perm".|`|asM2jBAjaa	They are natural
OMKDEun3aa	Add some baking soda to your shampoo make it like a paste and put it on the hair while it is dry    remember  oil and water does not mix<br>   rinse and conditoner after|`|dQh1YzV0aa	you should go to a new salon and have them fix it. make sure u get a hot guy. but prolly be gay|`|K7vCWru6aa	GO TO A DIFFERENT SALON && HAVE THEM HELP YOU GET IT OUT!|`|mMsjb43Iaa	I'm not sure what exactly is going on with your hair.  You may be allergic to the product, or he could have messed up the chemicals.  Either way, go to a new salon and have them strip your hair.  I'm sure they will have several suggestions for how to deal with it.  I would go as quickly as possible in order to prevent further damage.  Good luck!
