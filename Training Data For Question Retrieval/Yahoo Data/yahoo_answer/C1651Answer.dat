Hence, i received a letter and allowed me to apply PR once I got a job in Singapore. I just need to submit my application with the Job Acceptance Letter from my employer during the application.<br>  <br>  Hope this help :)

Don't worry too much about this all they need your address for is to mail you prizes.<br>  <br>  After you signup they will send you a confirmation link to your email address you entered.

MSORDfOKaa	'happy first day of lent'  is Felice primo giorno di Quaresima<br>  "happy ash Wednesday"  Felice mercoled√¨ delle Ceneri.<br>  But in Italy it isn't customary to give these wishes.<br>  Lent is the time when Christians prepare for Easter by thinking of things they have done wrong.<br>  Lent begins on Ash Wednesday. The last week of Lent begins with Palm Sunday, which celebrates the day Jesus entered Jerusalem and the people lay down palms at his feet.<br>  During Lent, Christians used to fast (give up food) but now a days some people try to give up their favourite food, such as chocolate, and not giving into temptation. Others might give up all dairy products. The Orthodox Church keeps Lent more strictly and people give up both meat and dairy products.<br>  Lent is a time when Christians remember the 40 days and nights Jesus spent alone in the desert without food being tempted by the Devil. Jesus used this time to prepare for His work by fasting and praying.<br>  In the Roman Catholic Church, Lent officially ends at sundown on Holy Thursday (Maundy Thursday), with the beginning of the mass of the Lord's Supper.
RNj5cYGJaa	I love Sacramento - I've lived here most of my life.  If you're going to work downtown, I'd recommend living within Sacramento itself.

The capital is the city of Vienna on the Danube River.[2]<br>  <br>  The origins of Austria date back to the ninth century, when the territory of Upper and Lower Austria became increasingly populated. The name "Ostarrichi" is first documented in an official document from 996. Since then this word has developed into ?sterreich.[3]<br>  <br>  Austria is a parliamentary representative democracy comprising nine federal states[4] and is one of six European countries that have declared permanent neutrality[5] and one of the few countries that includes the concept of everlasting neutrality in its constitution. Austria has been a member of the United Nations since 1955[6] and joined the European Union in 1995.[7]<br>  <br>  The German name ?sterreich is derived from Old German Ostarr?chi "Eastern Territory".[8] The name was erroneously Latinized as "Austria" (Latin auster "south wind", metaphorically "south" thus austrƒÅlis "southern" and so on. There is no evidence for the region being called "South" anything in any other language). Reich can also mean "empire," and this connotation is the one that is understood in the context of the Austrian/Austro-Hungarian Empire, Holy Roman Empire, although not in the context of the modern Republic of ?sterreich. The term probably originates in a vernacular translation of the Medieval Latin name for the region: Marchia orientalis, which translates as "eastern marches" or "eastern borderland", as it was situated at the eastern edge of the Holy Roman Empire (and of the Duchy of Bavaria, respectively), that was also mirrored in the name Ostmark, for a short period applied after the Anschluss to Germany. However, Friedrich Heer, one the most important Austrian historians in the 20th century, stated in his book Der Kampf um die ?sterreichische Identit?t (The Struggle Over Austrian Identity), that the Germanic form ostarr?chi was not a translation of the Latin word, but both resulted from a much older term originating in the Celtic languages of ancient Austria: More than 2,500 years ago, the major part of the actual country was called Norig by the Celtic population (Hallstatt culture); No- or Nor- meant East or Eastern,[citation needed] whereas Rig is the related to the modern German Reich; realm (among other things). Accordingly, Norig would essentially mean ostarr?chi and ?sterreich, thus Austria. The Celtic name was eventually Latinized to noricum, when the Romans conquered and Romanized the country that later became Austria. The name of Noricum was then used to designate the Roman province.[citation needed]<br>  <br>  The current official designation is the Republic of Austria (Republik ?sterreich).[9] It was originally known after the fall of the Austro-Hungarian Empire from 1918 as under the name Republic of German Austria (Republik Deutsch?sterreich) , but the state was forced to change its name by the Treaty of Saint Germain to "Republik ?sterreich" "Republic of Austria". The name "Republik Deutsch-?sterreich" can be found on early 1920 stamps and Money. The name was changed again during the Austro-fascist regime (1934‚Äì1938) , into Federal State of Austria (Bundesstaat ?sterreich) , but restored after regaining independence and the birth of the "Second Austrian Republic" "Zweite Republik"(1955 ‚Äì present).<br>  <br>  During the period of monarchy, Austria was known as the Austrian Empire (Kaisertum ?sterreich) ; however no official designation existed since the empire was strongly multiethnic. After the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867, the empire became known as Austria-Hungary reflecting the dual monarchy character.|`|rYldDHXPaa	for me the most beautiful place in the world. the country is very versatile so you can go in the mountains, or in the city. the people are very nice too.

If you know how to get to Fenway Park from Kenmore then you can get to HOB.

You can buy a ticket (in advance) for GBP59 return, but possibly cheaper if you are a non EU citizen travelling as a tourist. Check out the Eurostar website and travel agents at home.<br>  Don't bother flying - the cheap airlines fly from an airport 60 miles fro the city into airports on the periphery of London, and it will take you hours to get to and from the city centres.

Train from there to Leuven goes over Brussels and will take around 1h15.<br>  Flying to Brussels-Zaventem will be more expensive (but it takes only 15 minutes train to Leuven).<br>  <br>  If you find a boat to Oostende you can take the train from there to Leuven (hourly direct train but takes 2 hours).|`|7jM9Ghchaa	yes the best way is from Brussels -Leuvern you will love it and the train is very comfy and has a buffet so you will be ok if hungary or thirsty?|`|KmTyREP9aa	It may not be the cheapest, but the easiest and quickest route is by Eurostar from St Pancras to Brussels, then by local train to Leuven, the nearest train station to Werchter, then by bus or taxi to the festival.<br>  Have fun.

The exhaust from all of the aircraft required to move people in and out would kill the ozone even faster.

J70iEDBhaa	I just got back from Amsterdam! God I love that city.. Soooo beautiful! I got a wicked deal on ebookers.com.. For flights and hotel (I stayed at the Hem Hotel, Amsterdam) I only paid 400 dollars for 2 people for 4 nights. I will say one thing though.. prices have skyrocketed thanks to that crappy currency the Euro. On average its about 20 euros for 2 people to eat one meal. They charge for refills on drinks and things too which is annoying but oh well. The coffeeshops were the main reason I went there. They try to keep the prices down for us happy tourists but unfortunatly when they banned tobacco they caused alot of problems and many many shops are closing. Hell even half the red-light district was gone. Your lookin at about 10 Euros for a gram of some delicious bud so thats about standard pricing still. As long as you go in the off season.. (now till about april/may) you should be able to find some decent travel deals. Make SURE you dont pay for Taxis. As soon as you get there get a tram card. Trams take you everywhere for about 5 euros per day. I wish I knew that the first time because I wasted like 70 euros when it would have only cost me 20 euros for an unlimited travel card. Any more questions then just let me know.. Im full of answers  :)  Have fun in Dam! Smoke one for me mate!  :)<br>  <br>  Oh and I forgot! my favorite coffeeshop was called Rookies. When I was there they had a little guidebook called "The smokers guide to Amsterdam"  That little book made my trip 10x better. It had maps, coupons, important information, etc. So glad I saw it and bought one. I heard they sell them in alot of shops but I cant name any other then Rookies. You should go there and pick one up, youll be glad you did.  :)|`|PCpMqpP3aa	amsterdam is very expensive at the best of time but at the moment the exchange rate is very bad, why not try rotterdam or the hague both much better value and everything you can get in the dam you can get there but not touristy crap have a look at the link below for som clubbimg info<br>  <a href="http://www.holland.com/uk/clubbing/index.jsp?page=http://www.holland.com/uk/clubbing/cities/rotterdam/" rel="nofollow">http://www.holland.com/uk/clubbing/index...</a>|`|AA11705909	The Ôø° is weak against the Euro now so you will find things about 10% more expensive than here.

Avoid motorways - a route which avoids motorways.<br>  ? Walking route - a route designed for making the journey on foot.<br>  ? Bicycle route - a route designed for making the journey on a bicycle.<br>  ? Limited speed - a route for a vehicle which can only be driven at a limited<br>  speed. You have to specify the maximum speed.<br>  <br>  The only problem i had was in city`s and i got a poor satellite signal strength.|`|c2c7a5700a2d44609d3cdf659c65a995aa	We used a TomTom with Euromapping for our summer holiday to Brittany and beyond last summer and we found in invaluable and it never once sent us on in incorrect route. It also reminded us before starting any journey to "remember to drive on the right," warned us of speed limits and speed cameras and generally was an all-round success. It would be beneficial to buy and in-car charger which plugs into your car's cigarette lighter - assuming that you have one - as the battery life of a satnav can be quite short. I've never used one for walking around cities but this is possible because when you have reached a destination you can ask the satnav to take you to (for example) sites of interest, nearest doctor or hospital and if you remember the street in which you've parked you car you can programme the satnav to guide you back to it if you can't remember.|`|zdlzjZgeaa	If you don't have one already, I don't think it's a good idea.<br>  <br>  It would definitely help when driving, but you need first to download the french and italian maps to it because they only come with the maps of north america in it.|`|lYkvps54aa	i travelled round europe for four months, visiting over 11 countries and my sat nav was the best thing i could have bought, believe me it WILL pay for its self 10 times over, in fuel you use when your lost.<br>  <br>  remember if you get lost not everyone speaks english!|`|SttRtZ1Kaa	The only problem with using a "car sat nav" walking is the battery life.<br>  The max seems to be 2hrs.<br>  But idea in the car.<br>  Also you need the correct "card" for the areas.|`|OEOoaGu8aa	We went to France last year and I got really stressed out before going because we didn't have a GPS and our french is basic to say the least.  We really didn't need it.  If you print off some good directions from viamichelin before you go it will only take you a few minutes to adapt and then it's a walk in the park.  The roads are really good in France and the toll roads are excellent for long journeys.  The signposts are also very easy to understand and follow.  In 2 weeks we never got lost once.

RDgyb7W8aa	Being retired, my wife and I take cruises about 18 months apart.  Most of the time we call them anniversary cruises even if they aren't,  Last September was our first truly anniversary cruise.  We have went on 9,10,11 & 12 day cruises. We will be going on another in January of next year.  Most of the time we save a little money and then use the tax return to pay off the cruise.  Neither my wife or I drink alcohol so that is a savings.   Also after many cruise we don't take that many excursions.  Generally we enjoy the food and entertainment on board.  We do get off to buy a few souvenirs.  Depending where you live cruises are going out of most east and west coast ports.  We will be going out of Baltimore for the next cruise.|`|AA12333875	Well, Ms you do not have to be rich etc. My father is retired & I have not been allowed to work in 9 years & no big savings or stocks. Yet we go on 4 cruises a year. I handle all the bills, buy everything from A to Z. Just do not buy things we do not need. Why have 10 pairs of jeans when you can only wear 1 at a time. I own 2 pair. 2 pairs of sneakers ( WALMart) less than $20.00 & they last over 10 years. When going to the store & pick something up think if you really need it or just want it. Yes, the cruise lines offer discounts for pass guests. When I call they have all the info I things we need such as cabin, beds, eating etc. Now others may have better ways but, this works for me.<br>  Hope you can go on another cruise soon. About 10 weeks We will be leaving for our first of 4 this year. Also do not believe in credit cards.Enjoy.|`|XBulMn2zaa	I have been on 31 cruises. We go at least once a year, sometimes twice and once in a while, 3 times in a year.  One of our secrets is that we take the lowest priced cabin.  That usually is what is known as a guaranty.  We don't know which cabin we will have until shortly before sailing.  sometimes it is not a good location, but mostly it works out very well.  When you consider the cost of any other vacation, that is hotel, food and entertainment, I don't see how you can take a vacation any cheaper.  Most working people take a vacation each year.  I enjoy cruising so much, I have become an agent, but have yet to take advantage of the lower prices agents get because they aren't where I want to go when I want to go.  I did get a great deal on 3 weeks to South America from being an agent.  Deals are out there and they are easiest to find if you work with a cruise specialist.  Call me and I'll show you how cheaply you can go.  www.cruisesinc.com/sbozeat<br>  1-800-892-8694|`|cb1c8e5fcd8492bc3787fd1b614481ecaa	Once you go on a cruise you become a member of their past cruiser's club. You will receive many discount offers. I went on a cruise to Hawaii in January. On board I placed a $100 deposit on any future cruise. That acts as the complete deposit and gives an additional $25 cruise credit. I received an offer in the mail for 1/2 price cruises for reservations made by the end of February. I am now going to Alaska in June for $900 (single). You become addicted to it. I would like to continue to go on 1-2 cruises a year.<br>  <br>  One word of advice is to try to go on cruises where you can drive to the port. I live in central California and drove with my sister's family to LA for the Hawaii trip. We will drive to Seattle for the Alaska trip. Flying can be a huge expense.<br>  <br>  ? ??l???q ?|`|X6rFPI2laa	Former-passenger discounts and early-booking bonuses help a lot.  I have also found that my travel agent can generally find much better prices than any web site, even the "discount" ones.  She is a treasure!  For spending money I always empty change into a wine jug through the year, and when I'm about ready to leave on another trip I take the jug to my bank and turn it into paper money.  I keep my "travel" and "cruise" clothes in a separate closet so I always have what I need and don't need to go buy anything.  When I'm on board, I never spend a lot since I seldom drink and keep my gambling to the $100 per cruise budget I figure is reasonable.  I don't do a lot of shopping, but if there is some treasure I simply have to have, I go ahead and splurge.

6beL9zycaa	I don't quite understand your question, other than you want someone to do your entire homework assignment for you.  That's not going to happen, nobody has that kind of time or incentive to do it. Besides, it's an obscure question, not something anyone would know off the top of their head & could just toss off to you.  Get to work!
SyDFcKtoaa	There are many debates going on about that topic.<br>  You can read more about it here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altaic_languages#Comparative_grammar_of_the_proposed_Altaic_language_family" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altaic_lang...</a><br>  <br>  But it looks all pretty complicated to me. So, just to simplify things and out of my personal experience, I believe that there are a lot of similarities. <br>  The syntax for example is the same, many grammar structures are the same too, something which you would never find in European languages. I tried to study some Turkish since I spend a lot of time in Turkey and being fluent in Japanese with some Korean knowledge, I quickly came to the conclusion that there are many similarities and thus it was easy for me to understand and learn. The vocabulary words are of course completely different (it is good that there are so many words of French origin in Turkish making that part easy for me). Korean and Japanese have some similar words but I don't know anything about Mongolian language.<br>  Here are some similarities:<br>  Words can have a singular or plural value which will only be understandable out of the contexte<br>  There is no masculine and female form<br>  Suffixes are added at the end of words: Turkish: Ankara'ya Japanese: Ankara ni; <br>  In questions, the particle 'mi' is placed after the word in Turkish and in Japanese it is the particle 'ka'<br>  Counting: 10 is 'on' in Turkish  and 1 is 'bir'; 11 becomes 'on bir' ; in Japanese 10 is dju and 1 is ichi and 11 is dju ichi<br>  The negative ending of verbs<br>  In Turkish: yazarim - yazmam; in Japanese: yomimasu -yomemasen<br>  etc.etc.etc.<br>  <br>  One thing I also found interesting in Turkey, was the similarity of thinking, doing things and valueing. They were often only small things but they stroke me because Europeans wouldn't act that way and it was difficult explaining those small nuances to my European friends who don't have much knowledge of the East.<br>  <br>  @ Allan: good point about the shishkebab, there is yakitori in Japan, so similar....|`|de8847b0e6acfe0657f1f3e89b72f62eaa	"Suffix agglutination" is one of the things Japanese and Turkish have in common.

AA11326712	Your theory will never get any further than that.  There have been so many people throughout the ages who started off poor as a child, only to become successful and/or famous in their later lives.  Like:  Edison (imagine life without a light bulb) or Celine Dion, Abraham Lincoln, Mother Teresa, Ghandi, Dwight Eisenhower, Marco Polo, Vincent van Gogh, Marie Curie, J. K. Rowling, Stephen King, Michael J. Fox, Tina Turner, Jim Carey, Eartha Kitt , just to name a few.<br>  <br>  It is not the poverty alone that is the problem  Lack of decent education is perhaps a bigger problem.  And how society treats these poor people.|`|73b2c46bf81e2be1d93af950383a79e8aa	I see you are concerned with the overall health and well being of the planet.<br>  <br>  using your logic...<br>  <br>  perhaps, all humans should been destroyed prior to the common use of electricity.<br>  <br>  in those days even rich people had crappy plumbing, used torches and lanterns, were more smelly and far less educated.<br>  <br>  The world average has been steadily increasing with the progression of knowledge and technology. <br>  <br>  You use an affordable computer to be in this forum - 30 years ago a computer like the on you have now would cost more than a commercial airliner.<br>  <br>  You want to kill people that you detest?

What about preventing crime? How many children are born to poor mothers because of rape? What about going to the extent of sterilizing rapists? Why punish people because of their financial situations? I find it terribly ironic that in any country, people who seriously discuss enforcing a limit on the number of children the poor can have are also the same people that seem to think it's unethical to sterilize criminals. And these are the same people yet that judge which parents are better based off of finances. Leading by example, human contact, and love raise children, NOT money. If you raise a child with money then you end up raising an arrogant narcissist who usually ends up too uneducated to realise that there are other factors in the world and in the character of others besides money.|`|p3mLEnyFaa	I have a different view to the answers given, although i dont agree with what you saying, here is my view. <br>  <br>  Im for progress. Progress of the people, progress of the world. When you are rich, even though you are wealthy, you somewhat stagnate. Gathering wealth for yourself and family does not affect those around you. Lets look at the Hiltons for example. Paris Hilton was born from a wealthy family. Instead of assisting in the progress of the world, which is in her power to do, she rather let a Video with a Dicck in her mouth get out. <br>  <br>  Now lets look at the Rags to Riches scenario. Without poor people, this sort of scenario will not exist. When Entrepreneurs emerge from the dust, they create thriving business which firstly creates jobs, and stimulates competition which improves processes, standards, consumer prices. This will somewhat be a fair distribution of wealth.  It create new avenues for the world. and this is progress. <br>  <br>  Now it may be true that most poor people do not come out of this state. however, through those selected few individuals that do, change of perspective, motivation and mindset occurs amoungst the poor people. 95 % of all Rags to Riches Entrepreneurs go back and give back to their community from which they came. <br>  <br>  Having a world where Rich people can reproduce and poor people cant, is a world where progress will stagnate. This will not solve the problem. The problem is at the foundation, where education, motivation, dedication, ambition and vision is lacking amongst the poor people. The government and the Rich should step in and attempt to change the Train of Thought of the poor. But we all know the inefficiencies of the government, and most of the Rich is in it for themselves. <br>  <br>  Things should change.|`|yie2UE0naa	In the end they just don't listen to any advice  .... all the information and measures to prevent pregnancy is available and for everyone, there really is no need to fall pregnant ... unless you want to|`|b6461d8a8d3d34ce5dac5c4052085372aa	No. All people should be limited to two!

I do however believe that poverty is also a form of child abuse especially when people continue to have child after child with no way to take care of them or give them opportunities for a good education. So this subject is very complex as there are many factors to consider, but telling rich people to have as many children as they can just because they have material wealth could prove to be disastrous since some rich people are very dysfunctional and chances are they would raise dysfunctional children.|`|v6dfp8C8aa	No, it is against any person's rights.  And you cannot generalize any person's behavior.  What should be done, is to educate these people (and some of the 'rich' people as well) and to give them free birth control medication etc.  <br>  By the way, you probably do not really look around much...

iCqfmRC3aa	Nude is not "sexual".  Nude is comfortable, it is a personal preference to not have a soggy swimsuit chafing your body.  <br>  <br>  It is not a spectator sport.  Who cares what other people look like?  You will find people on nude beaches tend to have more fun, be more active and mingle, converse and play sports together more then on textile beaches.  <br>  <br>  It seems when people put on clothes, even swimwear , it's like they have donned a costume and have to act some part.  When you meet a nudist, you meet the real person, there is nothing to hide behind, so they don't put on an act.<br>  <br>  A Nudist realizes there are a hundred different body types and nothing wrong with any of them.  We do not judge others and have no prejudice regarding age, weight, physical disabilities, or any of the "normal" things, like race, creed, etc.<br>  <br>  So, if you are looking for wonderful people, of all ages, that are friendly, open, honest and fun ... then by all means come down to the nude / clothing optional beaches.  If you are a "looker" there to stare at people, don't bother ... you'll be disappointed because we don't have sex on the beach, we just have fun.  <br>  <br>  My favorite story is ... long winded, but the short version, is I wanted to be a "looker" my first time, I went to Blacks Beach ... looked for about 10 minutes, then a very attractive young lady came up to me and said "you've looked long enough, either get naked and join our volleyball game, or leave."

NK3VJgiRaa	Puerto Rico is a great vacation. San Juan is the biggest city, most tourists stay there. There are lots of nice hotels like El San Juan Hotel, the Intercontinental & more. Isla Verde & Condado are parts of San Juan with beaches. Old San Juan is beautiful & historical but with no beaches. You dont need to stay in San Juan but spend atleast a day there. See the historic sites like El Morro Fortress. There is also some great restaurants, casinos, nightlife & shopping. You can take a ferry to Catano & do the Bacardi Factory tour.<br>  <br>  Also outside of San Juan there are some great attractions, so you might want to rent a car (tour buses are also available but expensive). El Yunque Rain forest has some nice waterfalls you can swim in. Camuy Caves & Arecibo telescope are spectacular too. Also you can stay outside of San Juan if you want. El Conquistador hotel is gorgeous. Vieques & Culebra islands have some of the best beaches. Check out the links below for more ideas.

4b127bdc65641a05881903d7090f19c2aa	Usually the winter and summer are the busiest times and it's a little slower in the spring and fall.  In the winter people are looking for a getaway from colder climates and in the summer families with children are more free to travel because the kids aren't in school.  There really is no bad time to go because the weather is always nice there.  If you want to see humpback whales you should go between December and April.  Other than that, things don't change a whole lot from one season to another.  Rains are usually brief and some areas are quite dry all the time.  The city of Kihei on Maui gets only about 6 inches of rain per year.  That's almost the same as Arizona's Sonoran Desert.  Other areas are extremely rainy and get up to 600 inches of rain per year, but that isn't where you'd be staying.  Most of the waterfalls flow most of the time because the water comes from the mountains that get a lot of rain.  The flow may vary from season to season, but they generally don't stop flowing.

We did not have much money for a honeymoon so we went to Disney World.  It was so much fun and I would do it again some day.  Disney World has many different parks to go to and if you want to add a little exter you can go to Sea World or International Drive downtown Orlando to try out sky diving in a wind tunnel.   There is so much to do in Orlando you will not have time to do everything.  You also have Universal Studious which is a lot of fun as well.  They have two parks.  Over all if you are on a budget you can stay in Kissimmee, FL at hotels that cost only $20 - $50 night.  There are a lot of good eating places that you can eat all you can for cheap.  Try Cicis Pizza in Kissimmee.   Great price great food.  Over all my wife and I had a wonderful time.  We topped our trip off with a quick two day trip to Key West in the Florida Keys where we got to pet dolphins and see the sites.   I hope this helped and if you are looking for more of a resort kind of stay Orlando has many.  I would say Disney has some of the best resorts.

KsS90aczaa	I'm in CT....I have lived here most of my life.<br>  The highest income level would be MILFORD from the towns listed. It is the ONLY one in Fairfield County.<br>  <br>  Milford is ocean front....right on the shore, people are nice, but real estate is insane, unless your making a 6 figure salary good luck finding a nice home. School are good and nice town over all.<br>  <br>  Wallingford is a nice town too, blue collar, down to earth and close to middle of the state. I have many friend from there and some extended family there! <br>  <br>  North Branford, again nice parts near the ocean, tis ok near would be one of the last places I would live in CT<br>  <br>  North Haven- just like north branford...all like new haven, would live in West Haven out of all<br>  <br>  Orange- much more rural then north haven. It's not even rural just more wooded and country like, more " local fire dept' everyone knows everyone feel<br>  <br>  The higher incomes are in Fairfield County<br>  In HARTFORD COUNTY where I live, there's booming too!<br>  <br>  I live in BRISTOL home of ESPN and I like it here.  I have lived here for a while and purchased a 1500 sq foot townhouse condo with deck and garage for 155,200.   It has reasonable tax bracket and good prices on homes. Overall a nice place, not too city but not too countryish...I went to a private high school in West Hartford, which is another more affluente town as is AVON, FARMINGTON, SIMSBURY, GLASTONBURY!<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK...I'm not sure what your using the info for but if ur moving here, feel free to email me, I can get u more info on the town and the inside scoop! :) <br>  j.rehm@jillrehm.com|`|AA11619840	The first response is wrong. Milford is not in Fairfield County; it's in New Haven County. Out of those towns Orange has the highest median income, home values and is probably the nicest (although it is not ocean-side). Milford has a large chunk of the coastline, but it also has generally smaller houses and tiny yards. Out of the New Haven County coastline towns Branford is my favorite for its charming atmosphere.

I have a pretty good resume and I could not even find work in target...never mind a normal office job...I even went to a temp agency and there was no work for me. if you are to move to florida I would suggest sarasota it is about an hour from punta gorda but there is more work and a lot more around...personally I am moving back to boston...punta gorda was hit by hurricane charley a few years back but they have recouperated from it..it is still sorta a run down town...(sorry if someone gets offended)
83eab7f1aaa9cff1cb4a409762796271aa	Qualcuno ha detto che questa (e quella di prima) non √® una domanda, ed √® vero, sembra + una discussione politica, ma vabb√®...<br>  Sono stato 2 settimane in giro per il Venezuela a febbraio, e ne sono ripartito con la sensazione di uscire da una pentola pressione che sta per esplodere. I fatti di questi giorni sembrano darmi ragione.<br>  Da notare che alla partenza dall'Italia, avevo una percezione di Chavez completamente positiva; tuttora trovo che diverse cose che ha fatto siano ottime.<br>  Per√≤ ho parlato molto con la gente l√†, se posso lanciarmi a dare percentuali, direi che a favore di Chavez ho sentito una bassa minoranza, diciamo un 20%, il resto delle persone con le quali ho parlato (di qualsiasi ceto sociale) lo detesta.<br>  Di Chavez apprezzo la sfida nei confronti degli USA, ma ho la sensazione che gli presenteranno il conto tra non molto...<br>  Non mi √® piaciuto affatto invece il culto della sua immagine, presente ovunque, e la propaganda a senso unico; l'opposizione sembrava inesistente.

I prezzi degli aerei sono aumentati negli ultimi tempi, a causa dell'11 setembre, che ha fatto lievitare i prezzi delle tasse aeroportuale, a parte questo, la Varig, compagnia aerea brasiliana, praticamente ha fallito, e anche se √© stata comprata da un'altra compagnia, per adesso non vola pi√π per l'Italia, cosa, che ha fatto diminuire l'offerta, e aumentare i prezzi. Comunquem se tu riuscisse ad andarci in bassa satgione, questi prezzi scenderebbero, di 20%. In Brasile, costa pocco mangiare e dormire in alberghi tre stelle ( media 40 euro per la camera doppia con prima colazione a buffet). Per mangiare in una ottima churrascaria, paghi in torno a 20 euro a persona. Ma se sei il tipo che piace vivere como vivono i nativi, tu spendi veramnete poco per mangiare, perch√® vai a un ristorante " a kilo", e paghi tipo 7 euro a persona. Prima di partire cerchi in varie agenzie, e se vivi in una citt√† dove ci sono brasiliani e locali brasiliani, cerchi di frequentarli, perch√© loro faranno del tutto per aiutarti a trovare un modo pi√π economico per andarci.

It is going to be very crowded that time of year and staying in the park is going to make you vacation so much easier. <br>  Disney really doesn't offer deals. If you registrar now, you can get in free on your birthday for next year. Go on their web site for any new deals. <br>  Go to the library and get The Unofficial Guide to Disney 2008 and read! Also check out web site below. <br>  <br>  You should book your resort ASAP|`|50073dbd5ecac430d78adbf7aa450341aa	i don't really agree with the first answer, there are a lot of great motels and hotels in our area, but, he is correct on on thing: book now!<br>  Most hotels and motels will be jammed with tourists, so go online to Yellow Pages.com and look up any number of motels and hotels around the area (Kissismee;Orlando, or even where i live, St. Pete/Tampa area{we are only 75 minutes away from all the attractions}).<br>  there are quite a few savings for "special" groups out there.  For instance, if you or your spouse are in the military, or retired military, you get a discount for disney attractions and most hotels.  There is even a special resort for us on disney.<br>  Triple A and AARP also have great specials for you, and some offer employee discounts if you work for a major company.<br>  Good luck, and the site that was mentioned (allears) is a great one for information.

UKwPewSnaa	LOL... of course Shanghai! I've heard nothing but horror stories about living in Mumbai. The constant power cuts, the horrible roads and insane traffic, the never-ending procession of beggars, the endless sight of slums, the diseases (malaria, yellow fever), the Delhi belly (explosive diarrhea), the lack of sanitation (no toilets and filth everywhere), terror attacks, useless bureaucracy, etc. <br>  <br>  However, I did take a trip to China for two weeks last year. Went to both coastal areas and inland. Let me tell you, I'd be pretty comfortable living there. The cities are very nice, and even the countryside is clean. The pollution problem is real in some most populated cities (although Shanghai has surprisingly clean air).<br>  <br>  Shanghai is indeed awesome! The nightlife, the skyline, the bars, and the food all deserve two thumbs up.  Many American expats live there and love it (I am assuming you are an American).  Shanghai is a very cosmopolitan city with world class infrastructure.  As an American, you will be very comfortable living there.  You should not miss a chance to go.  <br>  <br>  Mumbai? I will pass for sure, unless I am sent there as a punishment.

Noch eine M?glichkeit w?re, nach einem Schiff zu suchen, Segler zum Beispiel, da sind jede Menge unterwegs und bei den Mitsegelb?rsen findet man eventuell jemand, selten, aber machbar!<br>  Und dann von hier buchen, je flexibler Du terminlich bist, desto besser sind die Chancen...<br>  Mal ein Beispiel Wenn Du Ende Oktober von K?ln nach Korfu fliegst ist zwar der Hinflug g√ºnstig aber 2 Wochen sp?ter haut das mit dem R√ºckflug nicht hin, von Thessaloniki aus klappts aber!
wH0edJoBaa	You can esily spend a whole week at Disney World especially if you spend one day doing Downtown Disney (shopping and dining).  I am not fond of Animal Kingdom and would never go back, but you can do <br>  Animal Kingdom 1 day<br>  Epcot 1-2 days<br>  Hollywood Studios 1 day <br>  Magic Kingdom 1-2 days<br>  <br>  Of course those are just guidelines.  Hollywood Studios is small and only takes a half day.  Animal Kingdom is lame and only takes a half day, so you can do both of those on the same day.<br>  <br>  Disney World and Miami are no where even close to one another.  However you can day trip to Tampa (about an hour or so) and do Busch Gardens..... much better than Animal Kingdom.|`|eD7qRBKHaa	If you want to visit all of the parks and it is your first visit, you will want a day per park at least.  Personally, I always like two days at Magic Kingdom and two days at Epcot.  That's 6 days there.  You might also like to take a free bus from your resort over to Downtown Disney to do some shopping, or there is also DisneyQuest there, an arcade.<br>  <br>  I really don't think a week is too long.  But if you want to go to the beach, Miami is a long distance, but you could drive over to Cocoa Beach for the day in about an hour.|`|rPbyDmjYaa	there is plenty to do in DIsney.   Stay at Disney, there are 4 parks.|`|BRyk22Khaa	7 days is perfect, and since it sounds like your going nonstop, that'll give you time to do a little resting if need be. There is a lot to see, and you'll be there during a busy period, so that means long lines which means waiting long so you can't do as much quickly, so you'll need those 7 days to be able to see all 4 parks (there is so much, you may not even be able to see it all). Don't forget to use Fastpass which is free and great!|`|0WASp0bHaa	Miami is no where near Orlando. And the beach is going to be a drive.<br>  We spent 9 days at WDW going to the different parks. Try going on a tour one day. The Keys to the Kingdom tour at the Magic Kingdom was wonderful. Only age 16 and above,so no little kids. It took up several hours and we had a great time. The Backstage Safari at the Animal Kingdom was so interesting. We got to "pet" a black rhino, and saw where they prepare the food for all the animals. You sound like you are going non stop. I would take a day or two and just hang out at your resort. It is a great resort with lots to do right there. <br>  You better book a restaurant for New Years Eve, if you can, they all may be full. |`|9NpXU7D2aa	thats not too long at all. <br>  and its really crazy cuz i'm going to disney world from the 27th of dec to jan 2nd!<br>  <br>  personally i'd skip animal kingdom cuz in my opinion its not up to disney's standards but obviously its your choice. <br>  <br>  with that said here is my schedule so you can get an idea of how long to spend where. <br>  -27th arrive at pop century at 11am<br>  eat and get settled<br>  go to downdown disney for the remainder of the day<br>  eat at captain jacks in downtown disney<br>  -28th go to hollywood studios<br>  eat at sci-fi at the park<br>  -29th go to epcot<br>  -30th relax by the pool<br>  shop at the hotel gift shop<br>  go to chef mickeys at the contemporary<br>  -31st get up super early to go to magic kingdom<br>  eat at cinderella's royal table at the park<br>  ring in the new year infront of the castle<br>  -1st go back to magic kingdom for a hopefully less crowded day<br>  eat at liberty tree tavern at the park<br>  -2nd pack<br>  shop a bit more<br>  fly home<br>  <br>  and you are gonna love the xmas decorations, lights, music. its really such a great atmosphere during the holidays. <br>  <br>  and you realize the time you're going is the busiest week of the year?! <br>  and new years eve is said to be the busiest day and the parks fill to capacity early in the day so you shou.ld get up and go when they open. and if you don't care for the crowds of new years eve that would be a good day to visit animal kingdom since they have no real celebrations for the new year. <br>  but if you want to celebrate new years big time then you'd want to go to either magic kingdom or epcot cuz their fireworks are amazing. <br>  i suggest no matter what you should do magic kingdom 2 days but if you are going on the 31st then you really need to do it 2 days cuz it is going to be jam packed that day and will take along time to get on rides. <br>  <br>  and you could do epcot for 2 days but my family always just does it in one cuz we like going to all of the different countries but we don't stay at them for hours on end like some people do. <br>  <br>  hollywood studios really only needs 1 day. you can get everything done plus have a little time to do your faves 1 more time. <br>  <br>  and animal kingdom if you chose to go can be done within 5 hours max. but if you love animals you may want to hang out longer just for that. <br>  its more or less a zoo with a few rides and shows tossed in. <br>  <br>  and downtown disney is a great place to shop and eat so be prepared to shell out some dough. <br>  <br>  and i really suggest a day of relaxation by the pool to rest your feet. <br>  when at disney you are always on the go and that can really wear you down after a couple days so mid week you should really take a break.<br>  <br>  believe me you can definately spend a good chunk of time at disney world and not get bored. <br>  <br>  well what ever you decide HAVE FUN!!!<br>  and maybe we'll even walk right past eachother while we are there.LOL.|`|LCAzlHhEaa	The last time my husband and I went to Disny was back in 2006.  We live in Southern Illinois & left on a Friday afternoon we drove to Louiseville, KY for the National Farm Machinery show.  We left Louiseville around 4pm on Saturday and drove all the way to Atlanta.  We arrived in Florida Sunday afternoon our reservation at Disney was not until Monday so we stayed in Tampa for Sunday night that was only around an hour drive from Orlando.<br>  <br>  We were at Disney for a week and we never ran out of things to do.  We stayed at Port Orleans - French Quarter resort which was very nice.  We actually ate dinner one night at I believe it is called Old Port Royale in the Caribbean Resort.  We were like little kids running around Disney.  It was our honeymoon; at first I did not want to go to Disney on our honeymoon but I was so glad we went it was so much fun.  I had never been to Disney as a child & my husband wanted me to go before we had kids and took them there so I could experience the magic of Disney.  There are so many parks; the Magic Kingdom, Animal Kingdom, Epcot, Hollywood Studios that a week is a good amount of time to experience them all.  Tip: watch the parades/fireworks shows on your first few nights while you are there & then when the parade & fireworks are going on at the Magic Kingdom you can ride popular rides such as Splash Mountain or Space Mountain with little or no line.<br>  <br>  Enjoy your visit to Disney! We are going back this Feb. to take my 10 year old niece who has never been.  I am excited to take her; but we are not staying on Disney property this time.  We are staying at the Wyndham Bonnet Creek resort which is the only non-Disney resort on Disney that is actually by all the Disney resorts.<br>  <br>  One more tip if you have not ordered your package yet I advise getting the park-hopper option & the Disney Dining option.  They are well worth the extra money.  If you are afraid you will not want to go to the parks everyday get the no-expiration option on your tickets & then when you go back you will have the tickets already.|`|OqRE3DQtaa	Like everyone else said, you are taking a long drive to get to Miami.  There are lots of activities to enjoy at Walt Disney World for adults, so I would also stick with just Disney World for the 7 days.  You are also visiting during a busier time, so you should plan on a longer vacation and visit the Disney Theme Parks in the early morning or late evenings for the Extra Magic Hours.  This way you can avoid the days, where the parks are crazy busy this time of year.  Staying at Disney World for the 7 days, will make the end of your trip more enjoyable.  You can enjoy the Disney Parks and spend some time relaxing at Disney's Caribbean Beach Resort.  They have some great new areas at this resort.|`|xumD09Lcaa	I think WDW is so large that you could stay a week and not see it all.  Plus you are going during the holidays, so be ready for some major lines.  Magic Kingdom and Animal kingdom as so big, you won't see it all if you devote 2 days a piece to those parks alone.  Have fun!|`|nqETIP3Vaa	Four days|`|50073dbd5ecac430d78adbf7aa450341aa	good question.  My wife and i live in near Orlando, and we have the annual pass for Florida Residents, and we come up once a month for the weekend, and we still have not seen everything.  <br>  I believe 1 week is fine, but note, if you are bringing small children, plan on getting up early when the gates open, then during the afternoon, go back to the resort and take a nap.  Then, after you wake up, come back to the park to enjoy the time, including all the great parades and fireworks.<br>  Also, during your week, there will be plenty of "extracurricular" activities related to the holidays, so 1.  be prepared to spend time in long lines, and 2.  dress warm, our weather can be chilly (for us anyway) down in the 50's.  <br>  Enjoy, and try to get out from Orlando to see the real florida, if you can.|`|AA10168889	Your schedule is packed with too many destinations, in my opinion.  The Carribbean resort is very nice, so good choice.  Make sure you take the Magical Express Disney bus from the resort to the airport.  I think it's free.  You will want to rent a car if you decide to spend a day at the beach, which I think you should do.<br>  <br>  Skip Wonderworks and Ripleys.  Skip Kennedy Space Center and Sea World.  That will free up your vacation time to really enjoy the other activities.<br>  <br>  Do not forget to wear sunscreen EVERY DAY.  I am a registered nurse and I am here to tell you that tourists show up every day at the local hospitals with terrible sunburns.  Some ruin their vacations because they end up having to stay right there at the hospital for the duration of their vacations.  Again, wear sunscreen every day and put it all over your body.  Reaply AT LEAST one time during the day each day.<br>  <br>  I would go to Aquatica- a new waterpark that opened this year.  With the money you would have otherwise spent on Seaworld, Ripleys, Kennedy and Wonderworks you can spend it on renting your own private cabana at Aquatica.  Having a cabana is better than fighting other tourists for a lounge chair, plus it will provide you with shade and semi-privacy when you need it.  This is an all day event.  Go back to the hotel for a nap and later visit Downtown Disney for dinner and evening entertainment.  One possibility is Cirque du Soleil for entertainment and Bongos for dinner.  <br>  <br>  Also check out Gaylord Palms Resort for a few hours one day in the AM.  It's an extravagant indoor tourist attraction in itself.  I like it, and I live in Orlando.  You pay 10 dollars or so for parking.  You can spend the morning there and stay for lunch.  Expensive food, but again, you will already have saved money by skipping Sea World, Ripleys, etc.  Afterwards you can go back to your hotel, take a nap, and spend the afternoon at the pool.<br>  <br>  That evening go to to City Walk at Universal for dinner and evening entertainment.  I think parking is free after 8pm.  Make sure you take a ride on the resort boat that takes you around to all the Universal Resorts on the property.  It's a nice relaxing evening activity.  Stop at the Portofino Resort for a drink.  That may also be a good place for dinner, although I have never eaten there.  Bring your bathing suit with you on the boat ride around the different resorts.  Each has a nice pool you might be able to sneak into. <br>  <br>  That's 2 days right there.<br>  <br>  One evening (maybe after a Disney Park) visit Disney Boardwalk.  You can take the Disney Bus from your Disney hotel to the Boardwalk area.  Rent one of the Trolley Bikes for 30 minutes and ride it around the lake.  Eat dinner at Shula's- an expensive but really yummy steakhouse at either Disney Dolphin or Disney Swan.  I don't remember which, but they are close to each other.  Make reservations. You could also take the Disney bus from your hotel directly to the Swan and Dolphin.  Bring your bathing suit with you to the Boardwalk.  There is a hotel there with a really nice pool that you could try sneaking into.<br>  <br>  Another great place (but expensive ) for dinner after a Disney Park is Victoria and Alberts at the Grande Floridian Disney Resort.  Make reservations.  Take a Disney Bus from your hotel to the Magic Kingdom Parking area, where you can catch the monorail over to Grande Floridian.<br>  <br>  I keep talking about dinner, but experiencing these good resteraunts is an important part of your Disney vacation.  The ones I mentioned are ranked as some of the best in all of Orlando.  Also make dinner reservations at the resteraunt at Disney Wild Kingdom African Safari Resort.  I think the place is called Boma.<br>  <br>  Also consider seeing the Blue Man Group show at Citywalk.<br>  <br>  To save money you may want to skip one the theme parks.  You may actually be forced to skip Aquatica due to cold weather or rain.<br>  <br>  As for beaches to visit, I would avoid Daytona Beach unless you really want to see the NASCAR track (which is huge and amazing).  It has a NASCAR attraction, but I know nothing about it.  You may even be able to ride around the track in a NASCAR.  Daytona Beach is overated.  It doesn't have good shopping, nor does it have good dining.  <br>  <br>  Consider spending time at Daytona Beach Shores.  This is near Daytona Beach, but not as touristy.  It also has a beach boardwalk.  Cocoa beach is another option, but don't choose Cocoa just to see Ronjon surf shop (which some people do).  It's just a big overpriced store.<br>  <br>  You really should also spend a half day (morning) at Gatorland.  It provides a real Florida experience out in nature.  Don't compare it to Disney because it's not as sensational, but it will give you an idea about Florida wildlife.   <br>  <br>  Just remember to bring sunglasses, at least 2 bottles on sunscreen, a jacket, a hat, a rain poncho, and a bathing suit.  The weather is unpredictable in winter.  Sometimes warm.  Sometimes cold.  Sometimes rainy.<br>  <br>  Disney transporation can be slow and crowded. It's free and fun if you're patient and allow yourself time to get places. Research all the places I mentioned and make reservations in advance. Also familiarize yourself with the costs of all these places and budget accordingly.|`|SfGyzMSFaa	The closest beach is an hour drive away, Cocoa Beach, just south of Cape Kennedy. Miami is at least a 4 hour drive, and there are plenty of great places to visit that are closer than Miami.<br>  <br>  You could keep your room at Disney and take a day to visit downtown Orlando or Winter Park; both less than an hour's drive North.<br>  <br>  The Citrus Bowl Parade is scheduled in Downtown Orlando on December 30th from 11: 00 am to 1:00 pm. You could go to the parade and then have lunch and drinks. The History Center has an exhibition of National Geographic Photos going on at the same time. Then head north to Park Avenue in Winter Park for dinner and maybe some shopping or museum visits.<br>  <br>  To be honest; you could easily stay on Disney Property the entire 7 days. Take your time at the Theme Parks; remember the lines will be long. Take the time to watch some of the shows that go on in the Parks. Here are some other ideas for WDW:<br>  |`|f3VXNcG5aa	I actually would stay at Disney for no less than 4 days. 4-5 days is about right.

I5cWzyBRaa	lima is not ugly nor full of poverty. it is dirty though. very polluted, but if you stay within middle class districts its ok. there's the beach, restaurants, larcomar, and culture. it has more culture than BA. european mixed with indigenous and even african and asian cultures. heck, i'm part japanese. it's very diverse. the people are nice. lima is very vibrant. recently the middle class has been growing so there are a lot more attractions. if u want diversity u should go to peru. it's very unique. i suggest staying in middle class districts, some districts can be very violent.        <br>  GOOD LUCK|`|8a1c4efde714f3448706c28696452e2eaa	Lima is a modern city of decent size, it is certainly lesser travelled than Buenos Aires or Santiago for that matter. It does have a reputation for pollution and not being extremely friendly compared to the alternatives.<br>  <br>  Buenos Aires is much more massive and comparable to New York City. It also has more of a european feel than other cities like Lima or Santiago. I like big cities, so I think I would prefer Buenos Aires for that reason. Lima will certainly have a more indigenous influence than the other too which you will find even more so in other parts of Peru. <br>  <br>  Santiago and Valparaiso are very popular for their University programs. It is comparable in size to Lima and certainly feels more like a Latin American Capital than Buenos Aires. You are also close to the beach and the Andes, so I think I would be happier there than Lima for a year. I just think you can find a more fun college atmosphere in Santiago than in Lima.<br>  <br>  We send many students to learn Spanish in all of these countries through <a href="http://www.spanishabroad.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.spanishabroad.com</a> <br>  <br>  Buenos Aires is the most popular, possibly on name recognition. We also offer a great Semester program in Valparaiso, Chile

Dn7Llt9Paa	I'm an Aussie and it's Great<br>  <br>  Although I live near Melbourne,  would recommend heading up to the Gold Coast.  Great for tourists and Aussies, the beaches are Beautiful.  Accommodation is plentiful and there is plenty to do.  Swimming, Relaxing on the beach, theme parks, natural wonders (hinterland), Cities like Surfers Paradise and Coolangatta.  It's easy to get around with airport access and everything is well signed.  Everyone is friendly and the atmosphere is completely laid back.<br>  <br>  THere is a fierce rivalry between Sydney and Melbourne, Melbourne will always win.  Melbourne is unique with quirky lane ways and streets.  Melbourne has trams not buses which are Quiet and efficient Parks and Gardens are plentiful giving the city real appeal.<br>  <br>  Come to Australia and Visit the Gold Coast and Melbourne!!!|`|60FBuhyGaa	Sydney of course is their New York City. It has everything, the nightlife, all the attractions, people. Its a pretty big place and with the summer around the corner, its going to be busy at the nearby beaches. Sydney during our winter is great (their summer). <br>  <br>  If you aren't up for the city or just want to get into a more low key city, Melbourne is nice. Its more like San Francisco or even Austin. They have a lot of underground music (unfound artists) and it is definitely less crowded than Sydney.<br>  <br>  If you want the more calm and subtle fly to the north where you can either go to Cairns or Gold Coast. These of course tie in with the Great Barrier Reef. Party life is fun in Cairns because 90% of the people are on vacation.<br>  <br>  So it really depends on what you want to do. Sydney is good for a first timer and almost all Aussies are superfriendly and always approachable.|`|MItKeNN9aa	i would suggest going to ramsey street off neighbours, it will show you the true way of aussie life!

YvNCOYZZaa	I apologize for the other answers; let's correct them here.  Passports for minors under 15 are only good for 5 years.  Because your passport is expired, you must apply for a new one.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://travel.state.gov/passport/get/first/first_830.html" rel="nofollow">http://travel.state.gov/passport/get/fir...</a> for the guidelines based on age.<br>  <br>  If you are a minor, you will need more than your birth certificate.  You will need more extensive paperwork and your parents with you.  If one parent is unavilable, there are alternate routes. <br>  <br>  If your name is different than the one on your Birth Certificate, you will probably need the court documents that verify your new legal name.|`|nKnc90jnaa	You didn't mention your age now.  Passports are valid for 10 years.  I would think you need a new passport, especially with the name change.|`|36a3ynpJaa	Ask at your local post office.  You will need a birth certificate and prob some other papers because of the adoption.<br>  <br>  Passports for adults expire after 10 years.  I don't know about kids.  You should get your passport right away since it can cost a lot more if you need it in a rush and spring is the busiest time of the year.

Other attractions are Parrot Jungle Island (which was building a small water park last time I was there), the Coral Castle, and Monkey Jungle.  Miami Seaquarium is also another popular marine attraction, but is so old and dated that it's like stepping back into the 1950's.<br>  <br>  Other attractions include the Miami Skylift, the Vizcaya Estate, the Museum of Science, the Everglades, Bill Baggs State Park, and South Beach in general.

hP2nzb2haa	Suggested Itinerary One:<br>   Grand Canyon North Rim Vacation<br>  Winter Road Closures<br>  Experience the Incredible "Canyon Country" Tour<br>  <br>  First Stop: Kaibab Forest <br>  The Kaibab Visitor Center is located at the intersection of highway 89A, in Arizona, and highway 67. Stop at the visitors center and see the wonderful display on the California Condor and the geological display of the five layers (steps and risers) of the Grand Staircase. <br>  <br>  Note: Some of the best views of the Grand Canyon are seen by taking the back roads through the North Kaibab National Forest to the rim of the Grand Canyon. If you go, be sure to see Timp Point (.75 RT mile hike to the point) and if you have time Crazy Jug Point. These are dirt roads and can be impassible when wet.<br>  <br>  Next Stop: Grand Canyon Tour <br>  Grand Canyon National Park <br>  Continue on highway 67 to the North Rim Grand Canyon, through the forested lands of the Kaibab National Forest. There are many interpretive view points along the drive through beautiful white barked aspens. There are few services once past Fredonia, Arizona. This fact makes the drive all the more beautiful, but do be prepared. If you plan to eat at the dining room at the Grand Canyon North Rim dining room, phone ahead and make reservations. (928.638.2612 ext. 160) There is also a snack shop and saloon at the lodge.<br>  <br>  Suggested North Rim Grand Canyon Trails <br>  Cape Royal Trail - Several miles after driving through the check point of the Grand Canyon North Rim, watch for the spur to Cape Royal. The Cape Royal Trail is an easy, paved hike with little elevation change. This trail is good for baby strollers and wheel chairs. If your time is limited in the Grand Canyon and you only have time to hike one trail, then this is the one to choose. This is the best view point at the Grand Canyon. <br>  <br>  Angels Window <br>  This view point is found along the Cape Royal Trail. The Colorado River can be seen from this view point. If you get the right angle you can see the green water at the Unkar Delta bend.<br>  <br>  Roosevelt Point<br>  Return to your car and go back down the road the way you came in stopping at the Roosevelt Point Trailhead. This is a .2 mile round trip that is an easy and relaxing walk through the woodlands, but is more of a view point than a trail.<br>  <br>  Next, drive to the Grand Canyon Visitor Center. There are a few displays at the visitor center, but it is more of a bookstore to buy gifts. Ranger talks will be posted there.<br>  <br>  Bright Angel Point<br>  The Bright Angel Trail is only a short walk from the lodge and Grand Canyon Visitors Center. The path is a flat gravel trail, weaving down to a view point of the canyon. The elevation at the point is 8148', with a 200' elevation change. The point was named by John Wesley Powell after a character in Milton's Paradise Lost. Looking closely at the rocks around the view point, crinoids fossils can be seen. The view from the point is magnificent. <br>  ``````````````````````````````````````...<br>  Restaurants<br>  Inside the Park -- Grand Canyon Lodge has a dining room with a splendid view. Because this restaurant is so popular, reservations are required for dinner. More casual choices at the lodge include a cafeteria and a saloon that serves light meals.<br>  <br>  Outside the Park -- Your only choices for a meal outside the park are the Kaibab Lodge, just north of the entrance, and the Jacob Lake Inn (tel. 928/643-7232; www.jacoblake.com), 45 miles north at the junction with U.S. 89A. <br>  <br>  Or really pack your own meals.<br>  <br>  Also check out this website:<br>  <a href="http://www.grandcircle.org/Home/tabid/1168/Default.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.grandcircle.org/Home/tabid/11...</a>|`|WbjqqXh8aa	are you a hot babe?
oAOUXSJcaa	Taken from the wikipedia:<br>  <br>  "Barcelona has a Mediterranean climate, with sub-mediterranean influence, which makes of it not to be the "classical mediterranean climate" with mild, humid winters and warm, dry summers. <br>  <br>  Barcelona is located in the eastern coast of the Iberian Peninsula, so, the usual west winds, especially in winters, which cause the wet climate in many places of Western Europe, arrive in Barcelona with low humidity, producing no rain. However, the proximity to the Atlantic, its latitude, and the relief, are the reasons why the summers are not as dry as in other Mediterranean Basin countries, because lows (not surface lows but high-atmospheric "cold invasions") can affect easily the area of Barcelona (and Catalonia), causing great storms, particularly in August. Some years, the beginning of June is still cool and rainy, like April and May which, together with August, September, October and November, are the wettest months of the year. The driest are July, February, March and June. So, on average, rainy seasons are spring and autumn, and the dry ones are winter and summer. The order is: AUT-SPR-WIN-SUM. We also have to take into account that the Western Mediterranean Climate is the most irregular of the world. This means that in many occasions averages are not what really happens. For instance, one year October can be very dry and July or February wet months. That's the irregularity. Barcelona and London have the same annual rainfall, but London's climate is not as irregular and torrential as Barcelona's.<br>  <br>  As for temperatures, December, January and February are the coldest months, averaging temperatures of 9¬∞C (48 ¬∞F) at the Airport and over 10¬∞C in the city. July and August are the hottest months, averaging temperatures of 24¬∞C (72¬∞F). The highest recorded maximum temperature in the centre of the city is 38.6¬∞C.[16] The coldest recorded minimum temperature was -6,7 ¬∞C on the 11th of February 1956 and -5¬∞C the 12th of January 1985. However, in the XIX century -9,6¬∞C were recorded in January 1896. At the Fabra Observatory, situated on the Tibidabo hill, 412 m above the sea level the record summer temperature is C 39.8¬∞C (103.6 ¬∞F)[17] on the 7th July 1982, and the lowest temperature ever registered -10'0o the 11th February 1956. Near the hills and the Airport annual rainfall reaches the 650 mm, and in the city centre about 600 mm."<br>  <br>  ----------<br>  <br>  All in all, it can be 25oC maximum and 16oC minimum but as stated above, humidity can give the feeling of being hotter.<br>  <br>  In any case, you should also take a light jacket for the evening and an umbrella or raincoat because it may also rain in June.<br>  <br>  We are not located in a banana republic, as some tourists sometimes think.

b3bc76bf01815fa490acfdd8f96d1fffaa	Technically Myrtle Beach is not having Bike Week this year. They have put new laws in place which is making it very difficult for people who ride motorcycles to visit. However, you may come down on your bike and ride around Myrtle Beach via route 31 anytime of year. Bike week should be May 7 - 17 this year. The city counsel and MB Police are targeting the bikers, so if you come beware.  Black bike week is May 21 through May 25, 2009.

BORIO not vorio= NORTH  and it,s   IPIRIOTES not pirotes=EPIRUS, all meaning...NORTHEN EPIRUS or NORTHEN EPIRITIAN,S    IN ANCEINT GREECE EPIRUS STRECHED FROM THE MODERN AGRINION TO MODERN TIRANA. any thing above tirana was considered albania..or illyrians.. but if you have a promblem with    the way greece treats albanians simply dont come to greece .. .. you see any greeks wanting to go to albania? OR is it the albanian wants every thign ready on a plate for him ?  go home and work hard and make ur self a nation... dont expect us to feed you we can help you but you have to pull ur socks up albanian and become your own nation dont depend on other nations like greece and italy... you have lots of resources make them work get a loan from the world bank..and get to work ..life is not just haging around  OMONIA|`|AA11589437	This is all wrong.<br>  I work in construction, and so I work closely with many Albanian immigrants (builders, craftsmen, etc.). They all have their Albanian names, Muslim or Catholic. And I'll tell you what: even in the first years that Albanians came to Greece, and Greeks trusted more the Vorioepirots (=Greeks from Albania), not all  Albanians claimed to be "Vorioepirots". They were proud of their nationality, and I give them credit for that. So they wouldn't change their name either.  Some of them did it to get benefits like Trek T said above. Sometimes some of them have changed their name into a Greek-sounding nickname, that is easier to use, same as Greeks in the US call themselves Gus or Steve. But over 1 million Albanians work here with no problem whatsoever, using their Albanian names and identity all right. Those who have Greeks names and call themselves Vorioepirots are indeed Greeks from Albania, who perhaps used an Albanian name before, because of the persecutions the Greek minority faced in Albania and teh fact that they were not allowed to be baptised in the communist regime.<br>  <br>  (Let alone the fact that they many Albanians have gotten Greek citizenship, when even many Vorioepirots have not!).|`|LMo8HaA2aa	Sorry but we don't make them do it, they do it on their own will. They just grasp the opportunity that atheist Albania gave them, in order to participate to a christian world, which seems to be more 'in fashion' than the islamic one. <br>  It's not Greece's fault. <br>  And if honey your aunt doesn't find work in Greece, it's because neither do Greeks find jobs in Greece any more. It's not because of her being an Albanian. Why don't she return to Albania, so that she can find a job easier?<br>  There are millions of Albanians working in Greece already, it seems they found a job.|`|gVIcEoNRaa	Hahahahahahahahaaaaaaa!!!!<br>  <br>  This is a joke, right????<br>  <br>  <br>  Well, let the Yahoo! audience know THIS :<br>  <br>  Since the border and the obstacles between Greece and Albania were raised in 1991, most of the 400 000 Greeks living in Albania came to motherland Greece to reunite with family and get a job too.<br>  <br>  Actually, the government started a special fund (much like unified Germany did for their Eastern Germany siblings) in order to assist the Albanian citizenship Greeks in their first steps in a brave new world.<br>  All they had to provide was proof of being born from at least one parent of Greek origin.<br>  <br>  And we are taking about some serious money back those days, plus totally free medical, bonus points for certain jobs, etc... etc.. etc (you get the picture).<br>  <br>  So, some Albanians with absolutely not even one Greek drop of blood in them, forged documents back in Albania (a country "famous" for their lack of central government control), for the right "fee" of course (bribing officials) in order to get a stamp on a piece of paper that claimed they were of... "North Epirotan" (aka Greek) origin, in order to get the money and the other benefits!<br>  <br>  See my friend, if you are not of Greek origin Albanian citizen you get.. nothing, nada, zero! (Why should you anyway...?)<br>  <br>  Actually, I have a few examples, such as... Simos, Yannis, Aristeides, Pantelis, Thanassis (and the list is endless) who... after bribing the right officials in Albania, got their "North Epirotan" ID (and they changed their name from "Arian" to "Yannis" (just an example) in order to pass as Greek.<br>  <br>  Its just a little detail  that they did not know not even one Greek word in the beginning, while true North Epirotan Greeks spoke Greek...<br>  <br>  ...F L U E N T L Y !!|`|bpvSMqjIaa	Hehehe, do you think an Albanian can pass as a Greek if he introduce himself as Kostas, Yiannis or Giorgos? Greek accent is very difficult for foreigners and a Greek can tell very easy who is Greek and who is not. <br>  <br>  The real question is how many of the Albanians in Greece today are there legally? <br>  if you can answer that I have another question for you...<br>  How come Bulgarians, Fyromians, Arabs and other immigrants in Greece don't have a bad name as the Albanians. What have the Albanians done in Greece for the last years? <br>  <br>  I know that you are not Albanian by the way.|`|a6p6zaYFaa	first of all your completely wrong. in Greece they dont change anybody's name. What are you talking about? second of all the only reason why there are Albanians in France is so they can open up their sex slave business in buy and sell teenage girls. Yea I watched the movie Taken and the Albanians were selling teenage girls. It was disgusting. They drug em up and then lonely ugly disgusting men (mainly Albanians) go ahead and do their nasty things to the poor girls.|`|qo7e7m4Oaa	Stupid joke! There is absolutely no such law in Greece about changing names to find a job! Hey if you hate Greece so much why dont you go back to Albania, wouldnt life be so much better there?? Albanians like you piss me off! I live in New York, and there is a popular Greek lounge/cafee here, and there are many Albanians that go there to hang out. The other day there was a group of them badmouthing Greeks about how horrible we are and saying "F*ck Greeks" WHILE DRINKING THEIR FRAPPE!! Yeah you hate us but you still wont stop coming to our country, visiting our lounges and talking about us! Now whose the one with the "real issues" here?|`|AA10421518	The system, as Trek explained, tried to be helpful.  But as you know, not all people want to be helped through a system. No system is perfect, I'll admit that.  But if you don't like the way things operate in GREECE, then just stay in Albania.   Problem solved.<br>  <br>  <br>  p.s.  My aunt wants her television back.|`|6N4Xam6Haa	Amused at the Q&A about Greeks and Albanians.<br>  I am from India and we know only one Albanian - Mother Teresa.<br>  She was one of the most respected persons in India.<br>  Hindus, Muslims or Christians, all loved and respected her.|`|5m4yaEJyaa	Here's a thought, why doesn't Greece just invade Albania, it'll be a 24 hour military operation and we'll be back home for the weekend and just change one name, Albania becomes new Greek province of Northern Epirus...problem solved|`|NGKwsawdaa	I don't know why they do it but you are right. My aunt is Albanian and lives in Greece and she can't seem to find anyone who will give her work.|`|mzsoiTrNaa	I don't think Albania can teach Greece how to respect human rights.<br>  Your country is responsible for many slaughters against the Greek of North Epirus.<br>  You should be thankful that our country doesn't kick out all your patriots because they are here ILLEGALLY. <br>  Is it a human right to be an immigrant? And if we assume you are an immigrant and you work an honest job ... then let's say it's OK ...but most immigrants are working in ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES.<br>  And as many other users told you: No one forced them to change name. They do it because they are trying to "fit in" or prove they are Greeks.<br>  Truth is that no Greek in North Epirus is muslim. Being a muslim is a clear indication you are Albanian.<br>  So, you can't put the blame on Greece for that.<br>  I put the blame on my country because they should kick all your patriots out LONG AGO.<br>  <br>  One last thing: Albanians aren't the only problem. Turkey is promoting the pass of immigrants through its borders to Greece because they are after the money. <br>  So, I guess that all those Pakistanis, Indians, Malaysians have a "human right" to tresspass in my country? <br>  I wish we had a serious GVT like in Italy: they put them in a ship and they sink it!|`|gqN4cdOfaa	I'm only here to say that I laughed hard when I read the title of this question and I laughed harder when I read the last sentence!<br>  You are right.You should compare human rights between Greece and Albania.Or maybe read about Enver Hoxha?<br>  <br>  P.S. Vorioepirots are greek people, don't get confused.Voria Epirus(Voria-->which means north+Epirus).North of Epirus.And since Epirus still belongs to Greece............you can do the math.If you think like that,then south albanian villages belong to Greece.<br>  <br>  P.S.2  If albanians feel so bad about what you say(which I've never heard before)they are free to go back to their civilized country and leave some job opportunities for greeks.No greek will feel bad about this.
eD7qRBKHaa	Absolutely.  Two or three days tops at Universal.  One day at Sea World, one day at Wet n Wild.  No problem.  All of these parks you can do everything or at least almost everything in just one day.|`|rSq790ksaa	That is a good amount of time. I did all four of the Disney parks twice in four days, you'll be ok if you just plan ahead what you want to do when you get there.<br>  <br>  Have fun!|`|tv0xUCoGaa	Hi Friend,<br>  <br>  Yes, It is enough time for mention places. But I think , You should visit more places at disney world with your bf. <br>  <br>  For more information about enjoying places of disney world you can visit our website.<br>  <br>  Thanks|`|sF13O9Fmaa	Yes, I would consider all of these parks to be one day parks. A day in each is long enough to see all or most of the attractions.<br>  <br>  Have fun!|`|UM9LlPWDaa	Yes, just budget your time. Know that you might not see evrything in each park.|`|24948e8cfccfac676ed650d70e787147aa	That is plenty of time!<br>  Good planning deal!<br>  Hope you and you boyfriend have a good time!|`|M7qU5MdOaa	Great planning.  But, when you're in Universal and Islands of adventure, you MUST purchase the express plus tickets...you'll save so much time that you'll probably be able to do both parks in one day.  At Islands of Adventure, make sure you get on line for the pteranodon flight first, cause they don't accept the express plus tickets.  After that it should be smooth sailing.  Enjoy.
5dWLIicYaa	NO<br>  the Boeing's launch customer is All Nippon Airways and their deliveries will start in LATE 2009.<br>  and btw, the dreamliner is yet to do its first flight in April.

ef3e8a055f877ac48bf7cb67749b1830aa	Well, not that you'd notice.  There are sooo many categories if you've booked a cruise before you are familiar with the 8A, 8B, 8H...I mean a cruise ship has about 100 categories.  <br>  <br>  You are getting a guaranteed balcony and when you sign in and see your cabin it will have a balcony.  However, you won't be able to pick a room that's more in the middle of the ship, closer to your dining room, closer to the pool.  That's extra.  So you may end up closer to the end of the ship.  A lot of people don't like being close to the casino or club and you might be.<br>  <br>  But personally I always do guarenteed b/c I don't spend that much time in my room.  <br>  <br>  You don't get upgraded a real category--for example you wouldn't get a balcony if you bought an oceanview.  It happens occastionally sure, but they tend to pick a platinum sailer who has done like 30 cruises with them over you.|`|f55f047934182c2d6e633d01e2bbbe1daa	yes -- most past guest looking for the best deal will book a GTY.
2q1XI0j9aa	OMG Disney Cruises are the best, I mean cruises are great but nothing beats disney quality and customer service!!!  I have been on a bunch of cruises and the disney one was my fave!! I wish i could have been recently, they now have the pirates of the caribbean ship off  the shore at castaway cay. Castaway Cay is really nice and fun because its not crowded with every other cruise ship in the world, its just you!   <br>  <br>  They have a teen club for teens, kids clubs for kids and adult only sections for adults. so there is something for everyone! My favorite thing was that you eat at different restaurants each day. On other cruises you are assigned to one dining room, but on Disney you get to experience them all and eating times are fun and entertaining and they even do a character breakfast!|`|VVSqTdaOaa	Eat all you want swim teen place and run around the ship dont fall off please|`|BO28Mn8haa	yeah. all cruises are great! i'm going on one in 3 weeks :)
5cce7ccee87e2efd0bc574dc8b3a7312aa	It depends on how much travelling, sightseeing etc you want to do. Where does your gf live? Unfortunately the current yen to pound exchange rate does not favour you!!<br>  <br>  I would say for food, if you mostly avoid expensive 'restaurants', and go to the regular no-fuss-just-get-some-dinner places, you can eat for between 1,000-2,000yen per meal (it's easy to keep to the lower end of that if you want!) So I'd say 5,000yen per day food should be more than enough, and if you're really wanting to stick to a budget, as low as 3,000yen per day is do-able.<br>  <br>  Most cities offer one-day travel cards for subway etc, usually about 800-1,000yen per day. However, you're better off asking your gf about travel costs in her area!<br>  <br>  Add to that sightseeing. Most places have entry fees around 500-1,000yen. Parks are free, and scenic gardens around 300yen. Some private (not government) museums, aquariums etc may be a bit more.<br>  <br>  Also, are you planning to stay only where your gf lives, or visit elsewhere?<br>  <br>  On a budget, staying in the one area, I'd say 100,000yen should be OK. However, if you're wanting to spend a bit more on food, shopping etc, I'd say 150,000yen is a safer number.<br>  <br>  However, if you're panning on exploring further afield (which I'd strongly recommend if you have the funds!) the cost will rise. <br>  <br>  The cost of many things in Japan are comparable to the UK. The image that Japan is super expensive comes from Americans and Australians, as for them, Japan is expensive compared to things back home, but for Brits, it's not that different!<br>  <br>  Japan is very interesting country, with a lot to explore, so there's the potential to spend A LOT of money! So I'd say bring 100,000yen bare minimum, but bring as much more as you can afford in order to get the most of your visit!|`|AA10662056	I think you need 10,000 yen for each day if you don't need accommodation. It means you need 140,000 yen, or 1,000 pounds for 2 weeks.
Gynfzaoxaa	6 to 8 hours depending on your driving speed and the weather.|`|yh2hr3Vfaa	Six in good weather doing a reasonably safe speed.
0766e0580ba4543167fe08d53224ecb9aa	I love Torquay. I wouldn't say it's great for sunbathing (if that's your thing) but the coves and views are awesome! There is a little old village there called Cockington, too. It has the old thatched cottages, nature reserve and craft fair. You can take boat rides and picnic up on the cliff (near 'Millionaire's Hill(?)) in a big open green that overlooks the sea and rocks - obviously it's better in good weather.<br>  <br>  I'd live there!|`|UzPFTdUFaa	Yes and while you're in Torquay take a trip to the magnificent and wild and beautiful Dartmoor National Park, and take the boat trip down the River Dart from nearby Totnes to Dartmouth. Also not far from Torquay is the late crime writer Agatha Christie's magnificent house and garden<br>  'Greenway House' at Galmpton near Brixham. Tel: 01803 842382 for opening times.
TCLsrse3aa	Cool. I can tell you this from experience and knowledge from having lived here most of my life. I currently live in north Clearwater, near the Countryside area.<br>  <br>  Clearwater ranges from gorgeous and upscale to near ghetto and trashy. If you choose to live around the beach area, you'll have to deal with lots of tourist and local traffic, especially on weekends and around Spring Break, summer, etc. Sure, the condos are awesome, but the taxes are high. If you go more inland, toward the US 19 area, you'd be in a more urban setting which seems to work for most people. It's also near the St Pete College Campus, which appeals to lots of people your age.  You have to be careful though, because if you go too far south (towards Pinellas Park), you might be falling into some shady neighborhoods that are known for crimes and stuff. But everywhere you go has its good and bad parts. The job market is not optimal, and many people commute to Tampa or St Pete for higher paying employment.  <br>  What else can I say...hmmmm...<br>  Your main artery of commute will likely be US highway 19, which runs N-S all the way up and down Pinellas County.  The traffic sucks! Just so you know.  But I always say, the beaches of Clearwater and St Pete make it all worth it.  You'd be close to Orlando and the surrounding counties, and there is a decent interstate system, although it's not close. You would have to travel across the bay to hop on I-75 or go way north and cut across to the East.  That's kind of inconvenient, however, the beaches are on this side, so who cares?<br>  Good luck in your move and I hope it's everything you guys are looking for.<br>  <br>  <br>  Coincidentally, I have friends who currently live in W.Lafayette IN, and they're moving here by the end of the year.  I've visited them several times, and although Purdue is an awesome campus, I'd much rather be here.|`|AA10250756	I hope you have jobs lined up or will be attending college. There are very few jobs right now.|`|fd747af047fac4ce6b0786a13d942ae6aa	I don't have to tell you this, but have a great time.  They are all Phillies fans down there.  The beaches are great and the girls too.  Good Luck!
