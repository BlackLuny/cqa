She isnt able to keep any food down relly and as a result (in addition to the drug use) has gone from about 110 lbs to 75.

Please help i am so scared. Has anyone been thru this? The Dr. say they can find nothing wrong (this time but she was hospitalized last year and they gave her A.R. meds and they helped a lil bit.

Started with itchy bumps mostly on back and spot on face.  Took to doctor and was diagnosed with a skin virus.  That seemed to get better but about two weeks ago a different looking rash (bigger round red spots .. kind of looks like bug bites) spread on her arms, legs, trunk, some on face.  They are not quite as itchy but a little bit.  Started to feel bad, tummy aches, headaches, fatigue, fever.  Took to doctor again this week and was diagnosed with mono.  They felt the new rash was also viral related to the mono.  Has anyone experienced this kind of skin condition with mono?  Any input would be appreciated.

Weight gain has been steady and constant ever since.  My doctors tested me for thyroid disease because of family history and I began showing symptoms around the same time I went on Depo.  Now I am reading on here that other people on Depo are depressed, tired, gaining weight despite efforts to keep it off, and I have even noticed a change in the brightness of the whites of my eyes, as one other person had mentioned.  All these can be related to thyroid trouble AND depo.  Has anyone else had experiences like this?  I am seriously wondering now if I should get off depo.  Also, I "spot" almost all the time.  There might be 5-7 days a month that there is nothing, but most days there is brown discharge.  UGH.  It's gross.  No cramps or pain but I'd rather have those once a month than all the other symptoms.  Now I just don't know what to do!

My boyfriend just came back from a road trip he took with the guys, & since he didn't shave that whole time period he had a ton of stubble. I was so excited about seeing him I didn't care, and so we spent like three hours making out last night. Today I woke up looking like I'd run a cheese grater over my chin. I guess the friction of his stubble against my face....just grated my chin up. It looks horrible!!! There's this rash-looking thing and the whole area is really raw and it hurts.      I'm 16, and have never had a break out before and I'm freaking out because a major event is happening this weekend & I want to look my best.       Has anyone ever been in this scenario before? How did you treat your face? How long did it take for it to heal? Did you see a dermatologist or just take care of it yourself? Could you wear make up over it? I normally don't bother w makeup, and am worried that wearing it now could cause more problems.      I would be so grateful for advice. Thanks in advance!

And then I see that nobody else is home, so I must have let her out. But I dont remember it at all! I coulda sworn I had been sitting at that table the whole time eating.

I am CONSTANTLY daydreaming.  My mind wonders to other things during conversations.  I can't focus on one thing without my mind wondering somewhere else.    The only thing is- I have still been able to get good grades somehow.  It's very difficult for me to do this, but I manage.    I mean, I'll be writing an essay or something and my mind just wonders to somewhere else.  I spend a long time on all my school work, and that's how I manage to get good grades.    I think I'm just determined when it comes to grades, because they used to be so much easier for me to get.    SO if I told my doctor I thought I had ADHD, and if he knew that I get good grades, would he not believe me?    I'd like to try out some sort of medication for it, so I can focus better.

Feel free to add anything extra you have to say about the NHS, I will include all in my analysis. The minimum I need to get from internet users is 10 participants. Here are the questions:  Age? Sex? What are important attributes in a doctor/nurse? Do you see any health professionals other than a doctor, if so how often? (e.g. pharmacist, optician etc.) What is it that makes a good experience of health care?

My husband is in the Navy threatening suicide and left messages last night saying that he hopes he dies on the operating table since I decided not to go for his kidney stone removal.

20090131102735AAoXzwK	Health;Mental Health	OHMYGOD? I can barely remember life when I was SEVEN?? People are remembering age FOUR?	Well, seriously, I can remember SOME times at extremely young ages, like 3 or 4, but interestingly I find only the big, special etc moments you know. Like when I broke my leg, was 4, but remember! When I went to the library for the first time at this one place, was about 3 but remember! However I can't even run a thought of how my day went at a certain place of residence when I was about six? Is this NORMAL?? Today we went out and throughout the whole trip I had actually thought we didn't eat lunch yet and I was full and everything and when I come back I see bread crumbs on the table I'm like oh okay so Salim (my little brother) made a sandwich, guess he was really hungry and couldn't WAIT for MOM. But we ate and everything and it was stupidly about FOUR PM.. -.-. Then another day when me and my mom were at a store going food shopping (it's a food store in a MALL) then checking out the clothes upstairs my mom found some shoes for my older brother and picks up the phone to call him to come check 'em out, he was also in that mall with my younger brother but not with us, so she tells him if you're gonna come check 'em out and all and he's like yeah so in my dumb dead head I think  "Oh ____ (family member) is gonna come get him wow he's gonna come all the way over here for these shoes" and tell my mom that wow he's gonna come all the way over here ('cause it is pretty far from home) for these shoes 'till she explains and I remember & I think WOW are you serious I mean what the heck is wrong with me and these types of moments have happened more then twice but these are the worst 'cause these things are BIG & just there and obvious.. but still I retarded forget them WHAT is wrong with me?? Is this normal does anyone else get this also how FAR and how much can you remember of your young ages??

Before that she was really cool.  Her 21 year old bf (shes 39) is a huge ***hole wannbe "gangsta" person. -_-.  He seriously thinks he's the greatest thing that ever existed.  He even hit me more than once (including choking).  I told my mom the first time an she just said "dont make him angry". It happend after that and I called 911 and get this: She defended HIM to the police and told them i was just mad because he made me do somthing i didnt want to!  He hit her aswell last christmas eve, and went to jail for 1 whole day (whoopdi ******* do, right?) and shes was like thats it im done.  But next day, shes picking him up from jail....  I have tried cutting and it did help, but mostly to get out my anger i throw things and kick and punch stuff.  I know this isn't the healthiest way to realease, but it feels **** good.  I kicked a hole in the wall a while back and broke my foot kicking a metal chair.  Im getting really tired of it all and if this is all life has to offer then im  seriously considering suicide.  I want to just run away from it all, becuase it freaking sucks. I am constantly becoming more bitter to everything and soon i probably will just hate everything and everyone.

I came home and was put on Paxil (which didn't work).I've worked one or two jobs since but only briefly and left because of the people issue.   I tried going to college for a few years but that failed as well (due to phobia of overcrowded classrooms etc).   I've since married and been a "house husband" and (more or less) a hermit. I only leave then house when i have to.   I was recently diagnosed  with severe clinical depression on top of the S.A.D. I was put on Wellbutrin but it's too early in the process to know if it works.      My shrink suggested that i apply for SSI. So what i need to know is if i even qualify?  If so do they back pay to the very beginning or what?      I'm completely cluess on all this so any help would be greatly appreciated.
20090131102909AAcLUQA	Health;Dental	I have a minor, constant ache 6 days after my wisdom teeth were pulled. Could this be a dry socket? ?	I had my wisdom teeth (all 4) pulled 6 days ago and the only pain I feel is on my bottom right side. From what I have read about a dry socket it occurs most often between days 3-5 and the pain is unbearable. This pain I'm experiencing is a minor, constant ache. The reason I think it is a dry socket is because it definitely hurts more than the other areas and sometimes when I brush my teeth I hit the area and it bleeds. I have followed all the post surgery suggestions including not using a straw and I don't smoke, but I've read that a dry socket can occur for basically no reason at all. Should I go get this checked out or am I worrying for no reason?

20090131130939AAY18bK	Health;Women's Health	I'm Sick of My Weight, But Not Losing Anything. (Even With Daily Excersize and Diet!)?	All right, I'll just be honest about it here.  I'm a 14 year old girl, 5'1.25", weighing somewhere between 125 and 130 pounds.  I've always struggled with my weight, and I've now decided to take the initiative to lose the excess pounds.  I excersize on an elliptical for a half hour daily, running on interval training from 1.6 to 1.75 miles on each go, except for Fridays, where I go to an hour long Tae Kwon Do session.  This is in addition to nearly halving what I previously ate.  On average daily, I eat 1200 to 1700 calories, and always in low fat, healthy foods.  This has been going on for about three weeks, and yet it looks as if I am gaining weight instead of losing!     I know these things take time, but my weight is starting to screw with my mind as well.  I feel intense cravings for food at certain intervals of the day, and even calorie-controlled snacks make me feel guilty about satiating hunger.  Basically, I've begun to feel that eating is a bad thing, which makes me twice as disgusted when I overeat.  My stomach is telling me that I don't even have enough willpower to become an anorexic, let alone lose weight in a healthy fashion.  And the stomach itself-- I constantly feel it protruding from my body, which in turn makes me severely nauseous.  I hate the feeling of it being a part of me.  I know that this is a problem, but nothing I do can shake these thoughts.  What am I doing wrong?  I'm scared as hell, and none of the dieting communities let girls my age onto their boards.  Somebody please help me, before my stomach consumes my sanity...

20090131125530AA152Av	Health;Mental Health	Abuse in home - mentally weak - can't survive on own - help?	I'm being abused since 2002. I have to live at my mother's house, though I'm 18, and cannot move out, cannot attend school, cannot drive a car, and can barely function in the world. I can't go to the mall, have issues watching tv, and so on.       My aliments consist of: Hourly panic attacks, muscle spasms, unfamiliarity with my limbs, hallucinations, vertigo, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, constipation, diarrhea, migraines, distorted vision, hearing voices, insomnia, paranoia, fears of being put in a psyc ward, zero appetite, zero sex drive, depression, bipolar disorder, pstd, confusion, memory loss, inability to retain information gained within a matter of seconds, feeling detached from my body/feeling unreal, anxiety, severely decreased cognitive functioning, sleeping for days at a time, body aches, Dissociative Identity Disorder, and so on.       Obviously I'm sick, I';ve been dealing with the depression, anxiety, and bipolar with lexapro for two years, which it worked, after trying over 50+ other antidepressants, literally. Now it no longer works, and tapering off it has put me in they hospital a numerous amout of times from withdrawl severity.      Though I have a great boyfriend, whose only flaws are laziness, smoking, and drug abuse (reason: abused as a child, SEVERLY, but afraid to seek help), he takes care of me, all of the time, for 9 months now, he loves me and so on, he's a real sweetheart. But I wonder how long it can go on like this. If worry one day he'll stand up and say he's had enough. I mean he's young, he'll want a family in the next few years, I don't think playing doctor to his wife and children and working two jobs to support us was in his game plan.       Nonetheless, though my grandparent's and mother's pleading to come home many times a week to be taken care of (because they dislike my boyfreind for not being rich, and talk behind his back to me, it's disgusting), it has been chaos.       Sure, my mother will run me to doctors appointment and bring me food when I'm too weak to stand and get out of bed, but I doesn't feel worth it with all the abuse.       In the past few years, the circle of abuse, consiting of my 13 yr old borther and mothe and I had been physical, less so now a days. But emotional always. That is tremendous. I come home crying to my boyfriend all fo the time, suicidal with frusdtration.      Last night, I was incapaciated on my mother's sofa, 102 fever, unable to use the rest room, moaning and shaking with a migrane. My brother turned on all the lights, would not assist me, and cussed and yelled at me for an hour, through the splitting headache, telling me that it's all in my head, that I'm a faker, and he know best because he's a 13 yr old docotr apparently. Then when I cpmplained to my mother, she ran to Walmart at midnight to buy him a violent game for his playstation. "Oh, shush, he doesn't mean it, he's just cranky. He has no father to be around. Feel bad for him," she says, "I don't need stress, just let him play his game and he'll leave you along." I instantly told her that this tells him that it's okay to cuss me out, and her out, and he will be rewarded in return (which ALWAYS happens). She will not admit to this fact, and by doing so she is abusing my by ignoring my feelings.       Even last week, which is a common occurance, my brother called my mom a fu--ing sl-t, cu-t, co-k sucking who-e, etc. And later she took him to the mall for very expensive shoes. (What the hell?) He's also very bipolar, very truant, does poorly in school like I did, isolates himself, has weight issues, hates his life, is very materialistic, vulgar, and crude, and is emotionall unstable with frantic outbursts resembling autism or ADHD. Though my mother says he's just askign up for attention. This is every day!      She's so afraid of conflict because her ex controlled and abused her for 18 yrs, she won't see a psychiatrist or even talk to me through any of our problems, won't even take motrin for a headache, because I belive she thinks it will mean she's crazy. But she'll make me try any pill under the sun.       All the time, the three of us gang up on one another and cuss and scream and fight and yell and threaten one another, all of the time. I can't handle it. And then we bottle up all of the emotions because my mtoher won't address the situation and take my advice.       I plead and beg, even scream, "please, please talk to me, if not about your problems of your sons, but mine," she'll scream, and yell, or leave, not wanting to be bothered, both of them claiming all issues are coming from me, that I "start up trouble," and that we everyone should go to their own rooms and not speak to one another.       I belive all of us, incling me, would have way less stress if we sorted out the issues. I wish I had a therapist, I wish they would come with me. I hate being emoptionallty abaused by them. And I even retaliate in defense, but it always gets rewarded.       I tell my mother that I don't love her, and

Now is it possible if i gave a guy a bl0w j0b & i passed type 1 onto his penis then we had sex is it possible that i could of picked up type 2 herpes that way? I have heard it don't work that way. I heard type 1 is type 1 & type 2 is type 2! U cant change them. I know that u can have type 1 on either your mouth or on the genitals. I also know that u can have type 2 on your mouth or genitals as well. But the main point is type 1 is type 1 & type 2 is type 2.       U cant have type 1 on your genitals & spread type 2 on your partners genitals? I believe it dont work that way! Please someone that has knowledge of this please inform me thanks.

Hi! ok well i went to the doctors like a month ago because i couldnt breathe i felt like my throat was closing up. They said i was getting panic attacks i disagreed with them. In december and November i was feeling weak and like my throat was closing up but i think it was because of my period those were the first days of the months that i got my period (ive had it since 12 years old) so i belive it was all just because of my period. Now my period came in January 19 and i didnt have a "panic attack" is it possible that they misdiagnosed me??? The psychologist said that i needed to visit her before my attacks got worse I DISLIKE PSYCHOLOGISTS AND I HAVENT HAD A PANIC ATTACK SINCE DECEMBER  AND I ONLY HAD TWO IF INDEED THEY WERE PANIC ATTACKS. My question is is it possible that the psychologist was wrong? Should i see her even though i havent had one since december or should i wait to see if i get another panic attack to confirm that i really am getting them!

However, at some point almost every day, sometimes for much of the day, it hurts!  It's sort of a burning type pain.  I can momentarily relieve it by rubbing it very hard, but as soon as I stop rubbing, it starts hurting again.  There are days when it doesn't hurt at all, but that's rare.  It's no better or worse with or without exercise.  Anyone have this problem or know what it is - I really don't think it's a fatty tumor.

20090131131023AAMWicN	Health;Diet & Fitness	Poll: Are You Skipping Rx Meds to Save Money?	We've already broached the topic of gaining "recession pounds," but now, a new report reveals that many Americans are going without prescription meds because they are so expensive. Are you one of them?       I confess: The amount of medication I take borders on the ridiculous. I have pretty serious allergies, so my routine consists of nasal spray, an indoor allergy pill, an outdoor allergy pill and once-a-month allergy shots. Plus, my allergies mean that my skin is prone to weird irritations, so I have various prescriptions for my face and body, to boot. Even with insurance, the whole shebang ain't cheap. But considering I might have a scary allergy attack if I don't take my medicine, there's no way I would risk skimping on my meds to save money.       Poll:   Yes, I don't fill prescriptions if I can't afford them.   Sometimes, as a last resort.   Never, I'm too scared to go off my medication.

20090131114108AAYDE6Y	Health;Women's Health	Girls, What Is Your Most Embarrasing Period Story?	Ok my most embarrassing period story:        One day I went to school and for some reason I decided to wear khaki (light brown) pants while I was on my period. We have to wear uniforms. When I got into health class and sat in my seat, I saw blood going in a line in the front to the middle! lol What made it worse was we did a fitness test where we had to do situps and pushups in class! I was doing my best to cover it up with my jacket. I went to the bathroom and stuffed my underwear with tissue.         After school was over, my mom went with me to buy some pads. I picked a new kind this time! They smell really good! lol. But as we were walking out the door, this lady was practically chasing me saying ma'am, ma'am! She looked at my mom and told her to look at me from behind. Turns out there was a big blood stain! It grew since school! Omg how embarassing! lol      So if you can top my story you will get 10 POINTS!

Well, I was trying to light a candle in my room cuz... idk why. and the lighter wouldn't work so I was just clicking it and I accidentally caught a piece of notebook paper on fire and I was trying to blow it out but it wouldn't go out so I put it in my sink and turned on the water and it went out finally but I was so scared and my wntire room smelt like smoe so I went over to my window and opened it but in my house we NEVER open windows and I never knew why (mom probably told me but I probably wasn't paying attention) but I was so scared and I did and then it wouldn't close and it was all messed up cuz the top was open SOOO far out but the bottom was closed (giant window) and I started screaming SO loud cuz the wind was blowing so cold at me and I couldn't close the window!       My mom isn't home now, she's out. My bro was home though. And there is this mouse in our apt building that goes from apartment to apartment.      So I start screeming to my big brother to help me and he thinks I'm screeming cuz I saw the mouse so he's scared to come into my room and I am scared that if I move away from the window the whole thing with fly open, breaking everything in my room. So finally I run to him and tell him wut happened (the lie version: That I was really hot and opened my window and now it wont close). He yells at me for being so stupid and comes and (he's like, really strong) pushes it closed but it's still not closed all the way and my room is really cold and I am really scared and 1wen my mom comes home I am NEVER going to hear the end of it and I am FREAKING OUT!!!!      I am sitting on my bed right now with a sweatshirt and a coat on. I don't know how to work the heat in my room and I'm scared I will mess something up again. I messed up FOUR times already today! First at breakfast I cant find any pans so I try making sunny side up eggs in a pot but they turn into scrammbled eggs (didn't actually taste too bad but I had some trouble cleaning up the huge mess I made). Then I tried cleaning my room but I made it even messier than before. Then the whole thing with the fire. Then the whole thing with the window!      I am so dead wen my mom finds out. I'm definately not telling her about the fire thing. I'll tell her wut I told my big bro I think.      I feel so stupid! And crazy. Anyone know what to do?

I almost always go to sleep around midnight and I set my alarm for 8 AM. That is 8 hours of sleep and seems like it should be fine. I've never actually gotten up at 8 AM though. Sometimes I sleep through my alarm (and its loud) while other times I get up turn it off without even realizing what I've done. I realized I really had a problem last week when I overslept for my 11 AM class. I did an experiment where I didn't set any alarms just to see how long I'd sleep. I went to sleep at midnight and didn't wake up until 2 PM the next day. 14 hours of sleep! And the worse part is I feel like I didn't sleep at all. I've never felt refreshed after a night of sleep no matter how many (or how few) hours I sleep. Could this actually be a medical problem? Some sort of sleep condition?

20090131113520AATCb3m	Health;Other - Health	Is nicotine addiction as hard to break as smokers claim it to be? I can tell you myself. ?	I have always lived in a family of smokers. My mother and father have smoked for over 30 years. I have friends who have smoked for years, and who claim that they can not stop due to nicotine "addiction." I decided to perform an experiment so that I could put myself in their shoes and finally give me right to criticize their unhealthy habit. I decided to over a 1-month period build up my tolerance to nicotine to the equivalent of 2 packs / day using Nicotine Polacrilex gum. I began with the 4 mg gum, building up my tolerance to 10 pieces / day = 40 mg nicotine which is over the equivalent nicotine of 40 cigarettes. I build up to 10 pieces within 2 weeks, and continued to chew 10 pieces / day for 2 weeks. At the end of the 1-month period, I was going to stop cold turkey. I was returning home for christmas break, and left my nicotine at college. There was no way that I would have gotten away with sneaking to the local CVS in order to purchase more gum, even if I wanted to, so I knew I would not fail. The half-life of nicotine is very short, so the physical addiction is gone within a few days. Therefore, I knew I was going to be in for a bumpy ride.       However, it was nothing like I expected it to be. Yes - I felt the urge to chew more gum, and noticed myself feeling groggy, and a little more easily agitated, but I still was able to act like my normal self. By the third day of no nicotine, I had no desire to continue chewing the gum. Yes, I enjoyed it thoroughly, and would chew more if given the opportunity, but I really didn't feel an uncontrollable desire to chew more gum. My parents act as though they will go insane without their next cigarette when they get that urge, and refuse to do anything other than smoke when the urge comes around. Therefore, I think that I am living proof that cigarettes aren't that addictive. There is no use in smoking cigarettes... in fact, the gum is even more pleasurable than smoking a cigar (which I have smoke about 5 in my lifetime) I have never smoked a cigarette and never will. Currently I have bought another pack of 4 mg gum and chew a piece or two a day, sometimes not. Yesterday, I didn't chew a piece at all, and I haven't yet today. Tonight, I might, because it is an enjoyable drug... However, as far as I am concerned the physical addiction is bull. Sure, the habit might contribute to the inability to quit, but as far as I am concerned, one's health is more important. This goes out to all smokers --> stop chewing, pick up some gum, and enjoy. :D      My question to those of you out there, is has anyone else performed this type of experiment, and if so? what were the results? Also, can you smokers out there give me more input  as to why you don't stop smoking and sacrifice your health for cheap pleasure, which actually can be obtained from buying the gum, and getting a nice nicotine buzz.  4 mg CVS brand nicotine citrus gum is awesome.

She said that I am farsightedness, but I have never really noticed a problem reading things close up. I have noticed more problems reading stree signs at certain distances. She also didn't mention that I would only need these when reading, so I am guess she is expecting they be worn at all times. So how can this help my distance problems, because these are basically like reading glasses if I am not mistaken.

I haven't had sex in over 3 weeks and used a condom, but like over the last week and a half I had itching and chafing on my balls.  I assumed it was just irritated from sweating, or like jock itch or something.  Then I got two sores and a bump on my inner thigh that rubs against them.  The sores dont hurt, but my balls do a lot, especially when I walk around(which I have to at my job).  I bought Lamisil 2 days ago and it helps, but Im scared it might not be jock itch and actually is genital herpes.  I looked at pics online and they dont exactly match what I am seeing.  I have nothing on my penis, just down on my balls, but it seems to be spreading around them now.  I dont really want to go the doctor if I dont have to, just want it to go away and feel normal.

20090225091821AArJmhc	Health;Mental Health	Question about anxiety medication?	I used to be addicted to multiple different drugs.  I got clean over 2 years ago (haven't even had a drink).  Over the past two years since I've been clean, i've been experiencing terrible anxiety at least once a week.  From what doctors describe as a panic attack, i don't think I'm getting those because they defined it as thinking that you're going to die.  When I get anxiety I do not believe that I'm going to die,  I just obsess for long periods of time (4 or 5 hours at a time) over whatever isn't going my way and how I can change the situation.  And a lot of the time I always feel like something bad is going to happen to me or someone close to me.  I think the reason I feel this way is because when I was using drugs, I did so many terrible things to people that were close to me, and I feel like now that I'm doing the right thing that its gonna turn around and bite me in the butt.      Anyways, my real question is - are there any good non-narcotic anxiety medications?  Do they work as well as the narcotic ones?  I know my mother takes xanex for her anxiety and I do not want to be on anything like that.      I'm going to be going to a doctor sometime this or next week to get an evaluation, but wanted to know what type of experiences anyone else has had?

It is hard to explain because i feel so low all the time... i hate everything to do with me, i feel like a burden on people all the time and hate it when people give me compliments because i dont see it... I know that my confidence levels are not high but even when they are, they somehow plummet really quickly.  Erm, i am more or less either really miserable or really angry and i usually have to go somewhere quiet because i come over all teary...  I often get times when i come over all emotional and ive looked into whether this would be pms... there are times when ive been emotional over that period but its on a constant basis you know... not just specific to that time...  I used to be like everyone else up until i left school... im at college now and its like i have 2 different people... one is for college and the mask i wear there and when i come home im exhausted by the pretence...  Ive looked at some tests on the net and they come back that im relatively moderate/severely depressed.  Its hard for me to tell you what it feels like because in the morning im okay-ish but then it gradualy gets worse... for the first year it was really bad, i ate every few weeks and confined myself to my room for four months and when i did start eating properly again it felt as though id lost the ability...  i dont know...  can anyone help me please...   thank you for it too... i really appreciate it       x.x.x.x.x.x.x.x.x.x.x.x

HELP!!!?	17 year old female.   since november i have been having blood on the toilet paper after a bowel movement. not alot, and its bright red. only once has it been on the stool itself. all other times its just on the paper. Also i have had to strain more than usual and there is some pain with the straining. also the stool usualy comes out in medium sizes balls. the color is normal.       i started taking miralx and the problem got 100 percent better. the stool was in one long piece and it was soft and there was no pain and no blood. and no straining. them once i stopped taking miralx the problem came back. my family has a history of IBS (iratable bowel syndrome) but no history of colon cancer at all.       also i have a very healthy diet, not overweight, a month ago i started drinking 8 glasses of water a day because before that i would drink only about 2. the increases water has not really helped. i exercise fairly regularly too.       there is no stomach pain associated with this problem.    also i generally have always had harder stools.       what could this be? colon cancer? IBS? anal fissures? hemorrhoids?

20090131140933AABbJhQ	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Heart Diseases	Echo went well...now another issue..?	I posted earlier this week about how I was nervous about my echocardiogram...since I wasn't allowed to run until it got cleared (I had a short PR interval on my EKG) turns out I just had mitral valve prolapse (this condition runs in my family) and it's no big deal at all so I got cleared to run.     A larger issue now...is that I got my blood work back and it turns out I have high cholesterol.  Remember,  I am a 20 y/o female who runs upwards of 40 miles a week.  I try eating healthy but sometimes I eat a lot of candy or junk.  I am still really thin and everything.  You can read my other question and see that my dad died very young from heart problems.  He went in to get his cholesterol checked after his heart attack at 35 and my aunt said it was in the 300's! He immediately went on medicine and was never able to get it under control.  My points were at 217.  I find this very surprising...considering how much I exercise.  I guess it's not the end all.  My weakness is also ice cream.  I guess over the last few months I have had a LOT of ice cream.  I would eat so much of it like a whole bowl full.  (Again..i'm still very thin).  I want to get my cholesterol tested again in April...I am not going to have any ice cream before then....but is there anything else I can do to really get that number down? What kinds of foods should I stay away from, and what is the max. amount of cholesterol I should eat in a day.  I just realized that a lot of the foods I would have do contain lots of cholesterol. (Spaghetti O's, macaroni and cheese).  I do not eat red meats and I drink only skim milk.  I don't have an abnormal amt. of cheese ...and the yogurt I eat is fat free, cholesterol free.  Why is my number so high..and how can I lower it the most?  What is the most it can drop in 3 months?  The nurse who called me with the results did not seem too concerned...However, I still want to drop it as much as I can. Thanks for all your help! I would appreciate as much answers as possible with whatever you know, regardless of how many people have answered.

I bought a package of Compound W bandages to remove a wart on my thumb yesterday morning. I put on the first bandage as soon as I got home. I've been doing renovations to my house and did some heavy work yesterday, and the bandaid came off about 8 or so hours later, so I put a new one on. I did more work on the house this morning and the bandaid came off again within about 10 hours, so I put a new one on. The directions state to apply them every 48 hours.    My question is, is applying these more often than directed unhealthy on my part, or will it hinder or stop the process of the wart removal at all?

I try and hit the treadmill for 20-30 minutes every day, and when I lift I so so for about a half hour, ever other day doing arms, shoulders and chest with a Bio Force machine, doing 3 sets of 4 exercises on weights I can max out at 8-10 reps. I also do pushups and pullups. SO, I know I need to eat about 100 grams or so of protein to help bulk up. Do I only need to eat that much protein on the days I actually lift (4 times a week) or EVERYDAY?

I would be ok with dealing with it, if they did not keep erupting and causing me severe pain. I was wondering if having these cysts can down the line prevent me from becoming pregnant. Is it better that they erupt or should I be worried?      I went to the doctor yesterday about it, worried that it was my body rejecting the I.U.D. then he told me this is what it was and that all I could do is pop 2 Advil when it erupts and causes me pain.   Is this right? Or do I have other options?      Thank you for helping.

20090131134626AA2wxcK	Health;Mental Health	Alone for 50 days?????	Please read all :]   Hey, In 2 years im going to go on a road trip across america alone for about 50 days. Ill be 19 when i go, half the time ill e in big cities and the other half i guess ill be driving in the middle of nowhere.   I like being alone but have never been alone without seeing anybody i know for long. Do you think this would be bad for my mental health being alone for so long not knowing anybody?   I can easily make conversation with people, so its not like i wont be talking to anybody. I want to go alone too, (im going alone by choice, so don't say don't go alone) :]   But what bad things do you think could come from being alone for so long? Any good things come from it too?    Any tips on how to stay normal, as im guessing many people will say ill lose my sanity for being alone for so long! lol :]      Thanks!

I have a 6 pack but its covered my a layer of thin fat, when I flex i can see an 8 pack.   I Have been actualy "working out" since september.    I was working out before that too just doing 50 sit ups at night and 50 in the morning, and lifting 5 pounds 300 times at night.    Now, as of september I have been using 15 pound weights and doing atleast 300 crunches and 200 lifts with my 15 pound weights and 150 situps.   It really makes me sad seeing all of these 12-13-14-15 year old guys who have abs better than me. On other questions on yahoo awncers I have read that there is a layer of fat over your abs.   How can I get rid of this? And how can I get bigger notticible abs? I can only have 15 pound weights until march. What can I eat that is full of protean too? give me a workout plan. Dont use words like liftcurls or anything, I have no idea what that stuff is.   PLEASE ANSWER EVERY QUESTION.    I feel like im nothing compared to all the other guys/

20090131135117AACz0Re	Health;Mental Health	I ran a red light somehow...?	Last night, I was driving myself and two friends home from another friend's house (not under the influence of any drugs or alcohol), and I had gone past a couple of green lights, but when I saw a red one, I recognised it as a red light, but I didn't stop. My brain like didn't make the connection between red and slow down and stop. I finally slammed on the brakes in the middle of the intersection when one friend said "What are you doing? It's red!" Then, I realised I had to stop. Thank god no one was coming, otherwise it would have been a very bad night.      I don't know what even happened. I was paying attention, and I wasn't distracted. This has happened once before, too. I was driving with my dad, and I did the same thing. I stopped when he yelled at me, and I again realised I had to stop. This is so weird and not good. Why did this happen? How can I stop it from happening again?      I really am not that awful of a driver. I pay attention, and follow the rules of the road. This was really scary.      Thank you for your help.

Most of my friends are intact, and I want to be too, even it just looks that way. Whether I do this now, or when I'm 18, have a credit card and can buy that "TLC Tugger" thing, I am doing it. I would just really like to do it now, because thanks to my many hours of research, I know that it will be a lot quicker for me to do this now, rather then later.      Thanks in advance,      Brandon

20090131134259AAhNB7s	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Cancer	Teenager with lump in groin?	Posting in this section for more specialized opinions...   I am an 18 year old girl and found a lump that is about 1.5 cm by 1 cm in my groin about two months ago. It is hard and painless, but feels regularly shaped (like a lymph node). I do not have any known medical conditions...      Everything I've read makes it sound like this is cancer, but I have absolutely no other symptoms and there must be other causes of things like this. I also read that normal for inguinal lymph nodes is <2.0 cm or <1.5 cm, depending. Any ideas of what this could be? Should I worry?      I should add:      The lump has definitely not grown since I noticed it two months ago, it may have shrunk a bit, but it's hard to tell.  It is also not "in" the skin, it seems deeper down, like a lymph node at the intersection of my leg and my pelvis.

20090131142835AACuXIU	Health;Mental Health	I REALLY hate this life..........................…	I don't like the life I am in.   it seems like every friend or acquaintance I make; the next time I contact them they're too busy to notice, or just have abandoned me altogether   everyone in my family i know is into the christian faith and i can't seem to run away from it-everytime i turn for help i get a bunch of religious-oriented help that doesn't really work because it seems that no matter how hard i try, nothing changes for me or gets worse than before. a lot of ppl seem happy; i'm always hitting a wall; i'm never happy and when i try to be happy it never lasts long   always something or SOMEONE to pi** me off   i'll call ppl and they're too busy to even bother with me and too into their own whoopty-doo lives   and just recently a christian cousin told me this and that and told me to get my act together in so many words; told me to read the 'word' and told me not to offend her when i sent her these two videos on asexuality. she called it 'evil' and i favor asexuality (or celibacy) because i don't trust men. i'm always afraid of something.   i hate this life-it's taking a lot to not off myself ;(

20090131143036AAgsJlh	Health;Diet & Fitness	How to cut down on sugars???!?	I've always been at a healthy weight and have always exercised, but my eating habits could DEFINITELY use adjustments. so for the past few months I've been making some major changes to my diet and the results have been great. I won't go into details about what I've done because I don't want comments saying "you should eat more protein, you should do this and this and that.."    but what I've had problems with is sugar. I LOVE sweets and while on some days I'm great at limiting them and don't even have any at all..some days are absolutely awful. I just start and can't stop. anybody have any tips on cutting down on sweets? I'm sure a lot of people will suggest fruits..I eat a ton of fruit already. I'm talking chocolate. I'd just like some tips on limiting sugars or maybe some better alternatives.    thanks!!

20090225090858AAzDvoZ	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Infectious Diseases	How long are you contagious after taking antibotics?	My sister and I are planning to have dinner Thursday evening together with our 5 kids. Her youngest one has strep throat and she says she's getting him antibiotics today and that she's still planning on going to dinner tomorrow. I don't want my 3 month old or my 2 year old to get sick from her son. I think it's rude of her to bring a sick child along to dinner and think it's ok. I don't care what doctor says they're not contagious after 24 hours, I still worry that my 3 month old daughter's immune system is not strong enough to fight that off if he sneezes on her or something. So what should I do? Should I go to dinner with her? What do I say to her so it doesn't come off so mean if I don't go? Is he contagious if he takes some this afternoon, will he be contagious tomorrow evening?
20090225091024AAP9Jwi	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Respiratory Diseases	Reduced Blood Oxygen Levels after Exercise?	Hi, all.      Earlier this year, I had some pulmonary function tests performed.  Overall, the results were normal.  However, one of the results showed a decrease in my blood oxygen levels after doing a 6-minute brisk walk.       My sitting blood oxygen level was measured at 98%.  After exercise, the saturation was 94%.  At the time, I hadn't done any regular exercise for a long time, so between that and my weight issues, the result is understandable.  All my doctor said was to start exercising regularly and this should help.      I've been doing daily cardio for a month now (30 minutes minimum) plus weight training and I don't feel like I'm making much, if any, headway.  If I really exert myself, I feel like I can't catch my breath  (I have a personal trainer who really pushes me...).        I'm worried that this might not be a problem related to my lungs but rather my heart...that I've got blocked arteries and that's the reason why I have a low saturation level after exercising.  I've had chest xrays done and they've come back normal.      Does anyone have any suggestions or ideas as to (1) why this might be happening and (2) what I could do to improve my lung function?
